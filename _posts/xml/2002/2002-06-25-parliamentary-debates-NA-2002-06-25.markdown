                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr F BHENGU: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Comrade Rusty Bernstein, a founding member  of  the  South
       African Congress of Democrats -
The SPEAKER: Hon Mr Bhengu, would you please take your seat? We are  dealing
with notices of motion. If  you  wait  until  we  come  to  motions  without
notice, you may move this motion then.

Mr F BHENGU: It is notice of a motion, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: It is notice? You do not wish to move it today? Very  well.  My
apologies.

Mr F BHENGU: Thank you, Madam Speaker. As I was saying, I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Comrade Rusty Bernstein, a founding member  of  the  South
       African Congress of Democrats and  former  treason  trialist,  passed
       away yesterday;


  (2) further notes that Peter Magano of GaRankuwa, who was sentenced to 15
       years on Robben Island, and was elected a member  of  the  Provincial
       Legislature in the North West province in 1994 and at the time of his
       death was serving as an adviser to the Premier of the North West, the
       hon Popo Molefe, also passed away last week;


  (3) expresses its sincere condolences to the family and  friends  of  the
       deceased comrades; and


  (4) acknowledges the important role these  comrades  and  cadres  of  our
       movement played in the struggle for a free, nonracial, nonsexist  and
       democratic South Africa.

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, I  give  notice  that  I  shall
move on the next sitting day:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the floor-crossing legislation will  be  examined  by  the
       Constitutional Court soon;


  (2) notes that the  Democratic  Alliance  supports  the  principle  that,
       subject to conditions, representatives should be able to follow their
       consciences and parties should be able to merge;
  (3) notes further that the DA believes that when floor-crossing leads  to
       changes of governments or administration,  the  will  of  the  people
       should be tested and a special election held  so  that  a  democratic
       mandate can be obtained; and


  (4) therefore challenges the ANC-New NP  alliance  to  place  the  people
       first and politicians second and  agree  to  hold  elections  in  the
       Western Cape and in KwaZulu-Natal, or anywhere else where a change of
       administration follows not on an election  but  on  the  movement  of
       politicians.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on  behalf
of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the decision by the OAU not to recognise the  government  of
       Madagascar's President Ravalomanana;


  (2) whilst  this  decision  comes  six  months  after  the  elections  in
       Madagascar, appreciates the fact that the OAU is finally prepared  to
       isolate governments which lack constitutional legitimacy; and


  (3) encourages African governments to ensure their readiness to uphold
       their commitment to constitutional democracy and to desist from
       changing constitutions whenever it suits their political whims,
       thereby causing political paralysis which often accompanies such
       arbitrary actions.

Mrs N R SHOPE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that  three  Polokwane  police  station  officers  were
       arrested on Saturday following the  death  of  a  policeman,  Leonard
       Hlagala, on Friday;


  (2) further notes that the arrested police officers are alleged  to  have
       assaulted and killed Inspector Leonard Hlagala; and


  (3) commends the SA Police Service for moving swiftly and bringing  those
       who are alleged to have assaulted the police inspector to book.

Mnr F BEUKMAN: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag, namens die Nuwe NP, sal voorstel:

Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  van die inisiatief van Abrie Botha, 'n wynboer van Vredendal,
           wat 'n ooreenkoms met sy plaaswerkers gesluit het om 30% van die
           aandele in 'n wingerd van 50 ha te bekom;


       (b)  dat dit 'n positiewe voorbeeld van die bemagtiging van
           plaaswerkers is, wat navolgingswaardig is;


       (c)  dat dit bevestig dat vennootskappe en samewerkingsooreenkomste
           tussen kommersiÃ«le boere en hul werkers 'n belangrike
           vertrekpunt is om groter toegang tot grondgebruik, -besit en
           -benutting te bevorder; en


       (d)  dat dit 'n aanduiding is dat die wingerd- en wynbedryf in die
           Wes-Kaap die voortou neem om groter toegang tot geleenthede vir
           die voorheen benadeelde gemeenskappe in die landbou te bevorder;
           en


  (2) die pogings van die Wes-Kaapse regering en die georganiseerde landbou
       in die Wes-Kaap ondersteun om regstreekser en konkreter
       langtermynsekuriteit en voordele vir plaaswerkers te bevorder.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr F BEUKMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes


       (a)  the initiative by Abrie Botha, a wine farmer from Vredendal, who
           has concluded an agreement with his farmworkers to obtain 30% of
           the shares in a 50ha vineyard;


       (b)  that this is a positive example of the empowerment of
           farmworkers which is worth following;


       (c)  that this confirms that partnerships and co-operation agreements
           between commercial farmers and their workers are an important
           point of departure to promote greater access to land use,
           ownership and utilisation; and


       (d)  that this is an indication that the viticulture and wine
           industry in the Western Cape is at the forefront of promoting
           greater access to opportunities for the previous advantaged
           communities in agriculture; and


  (2) supports the attempts by the Western Cape government and organised
       agriculture in the Western Cape to promote more direct and concrete
       long-term security and benefits for farmworkers.]

Ms N C NKABINDE: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the UDM at the
next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the Mpumalanga MEC for health's actions yesterday which
       attempted to silence the media in reporting the atrocities that occur
       daily at the Philadelphia clinic;


  (2) further notes the contents of the horrific footage that candidly
       reports the infringements upon patients' rights to proper medical
       treatment, leading to certain women performing abortions on
       themselves at the clinic;


  (3) similarly, expresses its disbelief at the actions of the MEC for
       health in refusing to accept assistance from Aids volunteers, and
       firing a doctor that did accept and encourage that assistance; and
  (4) calls on the Minister of Health to urgently intervene to protect
       patients at public clinics and welcomes the assistance offered by
       qualified volunteers to lessen the burden on our already
       overstretched health services.

Ms N V CINDI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 58 people were arrested for various crimes including rape,
       attempted murder and theft during a crime prevention operation in
       Katlehong on the East Rand last weekend;


  (2) believes that this reflects the commitment of members of the SA
       Police Service and the Government as a whole to fight crime in our
       communities;


  (3) commends SAPS for this successful operation; and


  (4) calls on all communities to work with police in fighting crime.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I will move on
behalf of the ACDP at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the recent spate of violent robberies that have
       been occurring in the Western Cape, in particular the cruel and
       heartless murder of five petrol attendants in Grassy Park early
       yesterday morning;


  (2) further notes that these five men were honest workers and
       breadwinners for their families, who braved the cold every night to
       provide a service to people;


  (3) also note that there were no safety measures in place such as
       surveillance cameras, security personnel, available telephones to
       phone the police, or an alarm to alert the police that they were
       under attack, all of which could have prevented this tragedy from
       occurring; and


  (4) calls on the Government to -


       (a)  offer their condolences and support to the  families  and  loved
           ones of the five young men who were killed;


       (b)  do everything in their power to make sure that the murderers are
           brought to justice, and to stand with the  ACDP  in  urging  the
           community to assist the police in doing this; and


       (c)  ensure that garage owners provide  adequate  safety  precautions
           for their staff in future.

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  I  shall  move
on behalf of the FA:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses  its  concern  at  the  insanity  and  grossly  destructive
       policies of the Zimbabwean  government  in  the  face  of  widespread
       famine in the region;


  (2) recognises with the DA that the order to commercial farmers to  allow
       crops to rot and not to plant new crops at a time  when  appeals  are
       being made for food aid for the region, is tantamount  to  condemning
       millions of Zimbabweans to death by starvation; and


  (3) challenges President Mbeki to end his  disgraceful  inaction  against
       the man who has become the Pol Pot of Africa.

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Metropolitan Council of Johannesburg on 20  June  2002
       resolved to donate R7,5 million for the construction of the Albertina
       Sisulu community centre to cater for destitute children and  children
       living with disabilities;
  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the construction of this community centre  will  provide  for  a
           much-needed service for destitute children and those living with
           disabilities; and


       (b)  this centre will empower these children by providing  facilities
           that will enable them to reach their goals in life; and


  (3) commends the ANC-led  metropolitan  council  for  embarking  on  this
       important initiative.

Dr J T DELPORT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move -


  That the House -


  (1) supports all attempts to protect the assets and money  of  ratepayers
       and,  accordingly,  supports  the   Scorpions'   investigation   into
       corruption in five municipalities governed by  the  ANC  and  New  NP
       before the elections of 2000;


  (2) believes that if any official or councillor was corrupt or dishonest,
       he or she must face the full force of the law; and


  (3) urges the Scorpions to extend their investigations to the  Mpumalanga
       and Eastern Cape provincial administrations and to the Nelson Mandela
       Metropole and the mayor, Mr Faku.

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, I give notice on behalf of  the  IFP  that  on
the next sitting day I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Governor of the SA Reserve Bank has recently announced
       that the repo rate will further increase  by  one  percentage  point,
       thereby pushing the prime lending rate to 16%;


  (2) believes this increase will  necessarily  negatively  impact  on  the
       economic growth rate and on job creation;


  (3) realises the predicament of curtailing inflation;


  (4) calls on the governor and the Minister of Finance to consider ways in
       which long-term interest factors can  be  separated  from  short-term
       interest rates;


  (5) believes that such separation will protect long-term lenders and long-
       term bonds of industrialists and entrepreneurs from sporadic negative
       increases; and


  (6) is of the opinion that the Governor of the Reserve Bank  should  only
       punish the true culprits and short-term speculators rather than those
       that endeavour to create true economic growth and job creation.

Ms P N MNANDI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Safmarine  donated  a  building  constructed  from  sea  freight
           containers  to  the  Agape  centre  for  abused,  orphaned   and
           abandoned children in Waterfall, Durban; and


       (b)  the expanded centre is comprised  of  separate  dormitories  for
           boys and girls and a central covered area which functions  as  a
           preschool and, at different times,  a  women's  skills  training
           resource;


  (2) commends Safmarine for making  these  containers  available  for  the
       needy; and


  (3) calls on other companies to emulate the example set by  Safmarine  by
       donating goods and other resources to those in need.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall
move on behalf of the New NP:
  That the House -


  (1)  notes  that  the  lack  of  good  corporate  governance  in   public
       enterprises is still a great deterrent  to  their  profitability  and
       ultimately the success of privatisation;


  (2) further notes a R10 million loss due to a weaker price as a result of
       the decision by  an  executive  director,  who  unilaterally  granted
       Xisaka the right to transport all its scrap iron;


  (3) welcomes the Auditor-General's quick response in the matter and urges
       him  to  assist  in  stamping  out  poor  corporate  governance   and
       corruption from public enterprises; and


  (4) realises that South Africa cannot afford another ``Coleman  Andrews''
       who enriches himself at the  expense  of  the  millions  of  poverty-
       stricken South Africans.

                 TORCH COMMEMORATING BRAZILIAN EARTH SUMMIT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF  THE  MAJORITY  PARTY:   Madam  Speaker,  I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President  Cardoso  of  Brazil  handed  over  a  torch  to
       President Mbeki at the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, today as
       a symbolic gesture from the previous host of the World Conference  on
       Sustainable Development;


  (2) welcomes this symbolic gesture; and


  (3)  affirms  the  readiness  of  South  Africa  to  host  this  historic
       conference.

Agreed to.

                        RAILWAY ACCIDENT IN TANZANIA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the tragic railway accident in Tanzania when an  out-of-control
       passenger train crashed into a goods train; and


  (2) expresses its condolences to families of the  victims  of  the  crash
       which killed at least 103 people and injured about 800.

Agreed to.

              PROJECT USING SMS MESSAGES TO ASSIST TB PATIENTS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the innovative project of David Green, a Cape doctor, to assist
       TB patients by way of SMS messages;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  the World Health Organisation has recognised  this  project  and
           has also included it in its most recent global report on health;


       (b)  the project has now also been  expanded  to  patients  suffering
           from HIV/Aids, hypertension and diabetes;


       (c)  Dr Green has approximately 3 000 patients in  his  SMS  databank
           who are reminded daily to take their medication;


  (3) recognises this project which literally saves the lives of  thousands
       of people daily;


  (4) believes that South Africans like Doctor Green, with  their  attitude
       and commitment,  give  South  Africa  hope  and  motivate  all  South
       Africans to make a positive contribution to our country's  future  in
       their respective professions.

Agreed to.

                    RETURN OF REMAINS OF SS MENDI VICTIMS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) remembers the deaths of 607 South African soldiers who drowned in the
       English Channel in 1917 when their ship, the  SS  Mendi,  sank  after
       being struck by another ship; and


  (2) welcomes the return home of their remains for reburial 85 years after
       their tragic deaths.

Agreed to.

                           AWARD TO ZACKIE ACHMAT
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates Treatment Action Campaign head Zackie Achmat  on  being
       awarded the Personality of the Year award  by  the  SABS,  an  annual
       award for the courageous South African who has made a  difference  to
       the lives of others; and


  (2) acknowledges his efforts to improve the lives of HIV positive  people
       in our country.

Agreed to.

              MINERAL AND PETROLEUM RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading Debate)

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Madam  Speaker,  hon  Deputy  President
and hon members, I also greet the traditional leaders and other  leaders  in
the industry who are with us today.

In my speech today, I intend not to be triumphant but,  instead,  to  extend
an olive branch. I did not want to  feed  into  the  polarisation  that  the
country is being pushed into - not by Government,  not  by  labour,  not  by
mine owners, but by people who have nothing to lose,  who  are  using  their
domination of mass communication to distort all of us, and, of  course,  the
lousy Opposition, which pretends to speak for the industry without even  the
mandate of the industry.

I am here to extend an olive branch because the building of this country
and, particularly, turning this industry into a sunrise industry, has
always been a vision shared by all stakeholders in the tripartite alliance.
This is a joint project and it is our quest to turn this industry around
sooner rather than later.

On 26 June 1955, the people of South Africa, led by the ANC, declared that
``the people shall share in the country's wealth''. Today, once more, we
bring that clause of the Freedom Charter to life. We bring sharing in the
country's mineral wealth to small companies, established companies,
artisanal miners, small miners and all our investors, foreign and local.

The Freedom Charter also instructs us that ``the land shall be shared among
those who work it''. The diamond diggers in the Northern Cape, who know
very little about technology, but a lot about tilling the land in the hope
of finding precious stones, will, in future, be assisted in order to
realise value for their sweat.

The Freedom Charter further adds that ``the doors of learning and culture
shall be opened'', and through this Bill we have determined that the Skills
Development Act shall apply fully in the mining industry. The workers will
be multiskilled and no mine company will be able to operate without opening
the doors of learning and culture to the workers. [Applause.] The wisdom of
our leadership, as demonstrated in Kliptown, has, once more, shown itself
to be timeless and still relevant, even today. It is a pity we did not do
this sooner. Anyway, it is not too late.

An HON MEMBER: Is that from a capitalist?
The MINISTER: I should like to quote the father of capitalism, Adam Smith:


  No society can flourish and be happy, of which the far  greater  part  of
  the members are poor and miserable.

Yes!


  It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, clothe and lodge the whole
  body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their  own
  labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed and lodged.

If even the father of capitalism implores us  to  share,  I  wonder  who  my
friends on the left are actually following now. [Interjections.]

We desire, with a passion, to help the mineworkers who  suffer  from  aching
backs, sore limbs and the dust in their faces. We also want to  benefit  the
homesick men in the hostels, whose lives we get a glimpse of every  week  in
Emzini wezinsizwa. That is the road we have travelled.

Those who have eagerly and impatiently waited for  decades  have  argued  in
their submissions that this Bill does not go far  enough.  There  are  those
who feel that the Government has gone too far and those, like me,  who  feel
that  this  is  a  perfect  piece  of   legislation.   Between   all   these
contradictions, I feel that we have reached sufficient consensus,  which  is
typical of us South Africans.

We have travelled a long way since December 1994, when the ANC released  the
discussion document on a minerals and energy policy. This  document  started
off a series of negotiations and debates around the future of  minerals  and
mining policy for South Africa.

The White Paper on Minerals and Energy was adopted in 1998, and  I  want  to
thank Dr Maduna for the sterling work that he  did.[Applause.]  In  November
2000, Cabinet approved  the  draft  Minerals  Development  Bill,  which  was
released for public comment, and the rest is history.

Those who accuse us of rushing this Bill must  have  been  sleeping  through
all of this. Those who have been excluded from this industry feel that  they
have waited for generations - for over a century - for  this  day,  so  this
could not be said to have been rushed. In the same breath,  those  who  have
had access and who have dominated the industry remain valuable  contributors
and we have no wish to alienate them.

The Bill is not in any way vengeful, but is inclusive and is about
accommodation. We remain convinced that, notwithstanding the public
positions that we have all taken in the heat of the debate, the Bill is
well rounded and many of us will be able to support it. So, even though the
current dispensation may have been preferred by the existing actors,
especially the establishment actors, the new dispensation is actually not
strange to them because this is what they experience in many other
countries in which they work.

One of the industry's main concerns with the Bill was the granting of
excessive discretionary power to the Minister. However, a comparative study
between the proposed provisions and the provisions of the current Minerals
Act of 1991 reveals that the discretionary powers are largely limited by
the proposed provisions of the new Bill.
The current Act provides for the granting of prospecting and mining
authorisation to applicants, provided the regional manager is satisfied
with the manner in which the mining is to be done and the ability of the
applicant to mine optimally. In terms of the Act, the regional manager just
has to be satisfied and does not have any restriction. Yet in the new Bill
that we are proposing, there are stringent conditions and criteria that
have to be met before we can refuse, and if the applicant meets the
criteria, it actually states that the Minister ``must''. So I am not so
sure who is worse off here.

In the current Act, the regional manager may issue a closure certificate
which will exempt a mining company from all provisions of the Act when the
regional manager is satisfied that the mine has been rehabilitated to his
or her satisfaction. There is a lot of ``satisfaction'' in the current
legislation. In the new Bill, it is criteria, not satisfaction, that are
critical.

The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill has, on  the  contrary,
limited this discretion and it is  critical  that  when  stakeholders  argue
about this, they stick to the facts, rather than perpetuating  a  myth  that
does not exist. [Interjections.]

The  Minister  is  also  obliged  to  approve  an  environmental  management
programme once the statutory criteria and requirements  have  been  met,  in
terms of clause 38. The Bill now applies the ``polluter  pays''  principles,
which will prevent future ownerless and derelict  mines  from  shifting  the
rehabilitation responsibility to the state.

The debate has been shifting. During the policy development and drafting,
when we had made the first draft, we witnessed the rejection of the Bill to
some extent, on the grounds that security of tenure was not secured as the
years for the licence were not long enough.

After examining international experience, we have been able to prove that
we actually are more generous. We are offering 30 years for a licence, a
renewal for another 30 years and, of course, with the ``use it or lose it''
principle, as long as one is using it one will never lose it. In that case,
security of tenure is guaranteed. When that could not hold water as a
problem with security of tenure, it was then raised that the fact that BEE
is not defined constitutes an insecurity of tenure. We have now defined
BEE; it is in the Bill. I do not know now what will be raised next.

The contents of the Bill include national patrimony, the vesting of the
mineral rights in the custodianship of the state, redress, the
socioeconomic development and uplifting of mining communities, respect for
the environment and the ``use it or lose it'' principle, and, of course, it
provides compensation where anybody has a reason to feel that their
property has been expropriated.

It is therefore inaccurate to say that there is no compensation in this
Bill. The Bill also provides for beneficiation, and I must emphasise that
almost all African economies that mine stop at mining, with very little
effort made at beneficiating our minerals. In that way, we export jobs.

In this Bill, beneficiation will be entrenched in the sense that as long as
the market conditions prevail, the mining companies will be expected to
make provisions for beneficiating in South Africa. However, where the
market conditions are obviously against beneficiation, it will be possible
for the mining companies to export their raw material.

We have been asked why we have legislated redress. I can tell the House
that until the last 10 years, to be exact, blacks were prohibited by law
from participating in the mining industry. In defining empowerment, we have
included equity for new entrants, in particular, in existing and new mines,
affirmative procurement, employment equity, which will expect all BEE
players in the mining industry to be operational; otherwise their bona
fides as genuine empowerment companies will be questionable.

We have also made it compulsory for BEE companies and their partners to
have a proper training plan which will ensure that within that company
there is upward mobility and there is a skills plan that will benefit the
workers. All of those things put together compose what we call, not BEE,
but broad-based socioeconomic empowerment.

There are benefits for communities in the form of royalties that will
continue to be used for social development. We are also going to encourage
the communities, especially the traditional communities, to apply for their
licences and assist them to qualify so that, in their own right, they can
also mine.

I would like to acknowledge the representatives of the traditional
communities who are here with us today, somewhere up there in the gallery.
[Applause.] So it is not true that the Government and the Bafokeng are at
each other's throats. We have found one another and we have a unified way
forward. [Applause.]

The Bill also makes provision, through the money Bill, for the
rehabilitation of ghost towns as well as for ensuring that the dense labour-
sending areas where the miners come from will also benefit from the mining
industry. The social and labour plan which is also included here, and has
been thoroughly discussed with our colleagues in organised labour, will
ensure that in the event of retrenchment, provision is adequately made
earlier on in the existence of the mine, rather than later, that there is
welfare, including housing, for the workers, that a skills development plan
is in place and, of course, that the local communities which are affected
by retrenchments are also taken on board.

The Bill, as it stands now, is not a Bill for racial polarisation. It is a
Bill for all South Africans who must find one another. I would like to see
a future where the Koekemoer and Bakgatla sons and daughters own the same
mine, where one can find joint ventures between Toronto and Kwa-Mamtane.

We are not, therefore, in this instance, trying to isolate any of the
players, but we are not apologetic about the aggressive empowerment that we
are going to pursue. For us, that is an important test case. If we fail to
redress and to change the ownership patterns, then we should not have
bothered to have the Bill at all.

As for the way forward, this has been a highly emotive Bill and we would
like all the stakeholders to work together. We would like the Chamber of
Mines, as an important employer, to ensure that it is able to find common
ground with the other actors that are coming into the industry. After all,
these are going to be their partners, and we think that, as an organised
employer, they continue to have an important role.

I have also instructed my director-general to work closely with Anglo
Platinum, so that they can find accommodation on what is otherwise
threatening to divide us and have us fighting it out in court. I hope,
without compromising any principles, we will be able to help one another.

I would like to thank many people who have made this possible, starting
with my staff and the drafting team which is sitting up there.
Khanisukumeni. [Please stand up.] [Applause.] My staff are very young and
have given it their all. [Applause.] I would like to thank organised labour
for their unfailing support and robust criticism, the Chamber of Mines and
black business in all its forms, which united in this Bill. [Applause.]

I would like to thank the NGOs. I would like to thank the churches for
continuously calling me and urging me to move ahead. I would like to thank
academics, especially Dr Wayne Colliston, for their support. I would like
to thank the banks for the sound and frank advice that they have given us,
to thank Bridgette Radebe and the junior and small miners that she has led.
[Applause.] Jeff can pass the message on.

I would also like to thank the international investors who have done a
sterling job in giving us advice and have gone a step further in ensuring
that they put in place mechanisms to support BEE. Of course, I would like
to thank family and friends - Bonga and Bulelani, who are sitting over
there - and, lastly, Cabinet colleagues who have been supporting me. I
would like to quote from Minister Manuel's letter, which I received today.
It reads as follows:


  Today is a big day for you, and I thought it appropriate to wish you
  well.

Thanks, Trev. I always appreciate it. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! We have noted who started the applause for Mrs
Bridgette Radebe. [Laughter.]

Mr T M GONIWE: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President and hon members, on an
occasion of such historic significance as this one, it becomes imperative
for us to take stock of where we come from in order properly to understand
where we are going.

Often we are told by historians that our nation came into existence when
Jan van Riebeeck landed in the Cape with the three ships in 1652. Many have
forgotten the fact that South Africa was already inhabited by human beings
long before the arrival of the white man. Our people had, prior to the
arrival of those who purport to have brought civilisation to us, lived in a
system which recognised communal ownership of land. In other words, land
was held in trust by the chief on behalf and for the benefit of the people.

There was mining. In Southern Africa the oldest mines are at least 26 000
years old and copper mines had tunnels that ran for hundreds of metres
underground. But it was this established system of landownership which was
later abused to dispossess us of our land.

No one can deny the fact that the current situation was born out of the
marginalisation of indigenous South Africans. Nothing illustrates this
dispossession more clearly than the loss of our land. Repressive colonial
laws in the late 19th century prohibited the registration of immovable
property in the name of persons whose parents were both natives. In these
circumstances Africans resorted to the expedient of arranging with
missionaries to buy land for them which was then registered in the name of
the missionary on behalf of the tribe.

One of the colonial masters, Sir Theophilus Shepstone, did not approve of
land purchased by Africans being held and registered by missionaries on
behalf of tribes. He instructed that all land purchased by or for natives
was to be held in trust by the secretary of native affairs for such
natives. In early 1880 the government of the Transvaal Republic decided
officially that the secretary for native affairs be appointed ex officio as
trustee for land purchased by native tribes. After the formation of South
Africa, the 1913 Land Act put the nail in the coffin for black
landownership.

Why do we link landownership to minerals and mining? We are told by lawyers
that South African mining and mineral laws are based on the common-law
principle that states that owner of land owns everything below and above
the surface of the earth. If blacks could not own land, they certainly
could not mine.

Provisions under prior legislation which granted to the landowner the
exclusive right to prospect together with the option to acquire a mining
lease were not applicable to blacks as they could not legally own land in
most of the country. A barrage of legislation that followed specifically
banned black people from owning and operating mines, from managing any part
of the mining industry and even from working in the mines in any capacity
above that of an unskilled labourer.

In case some people in this House have conveniently short memories, we need
to remind them that this country had, inter alia, laws on its Statute Book
which expressly prevented blacks, merely because they were black, from
having access to mineral rights. Section 133 of the Gold Law of the South
African Republic, Law 15 of 1898, provided that, and I quote:
  No coloured person, defined to mean African, Asiatic, Native or Coloured
  American, Coolie of Chinaman, may be a licence holder or in any way be
  connected with the working of the diggings, but shall be allowed only as
  a workman in the service of whites.

Twenty-five years ago, in our own lifetime, mining legislation under which
the mineral laws of South Africa were consolidated provided that no
prospecting permit would be issued to any coloured person or to any black
person. This was repealed only 10 years ago without any significant change
in the patterns of ownership.

It is a little-known fact that many indigenous South Africans actually
owned and worked diamond claims, firstly on the Vaal River diggings and
then in the four diamond mines operational in Kimberley prior to July 1872.
In fact, available evidence shows that in mid-1872 at least 80% of all
diamond mines were owned and worked by indigenous people for their own
account. No compensation was paid to those blacks and coloured persons
whose wealth and claims were seized.

In July 1872 the introduction of certain pass and other laws removed all
mineral rights ownership from indigenous people and restricted their
movement, thus curtailing their economic effectiveness. Cecil John Rhodes's
laws, passed around 1887, it will be remembered, effectively reduced all
black people to a life as a source of cheap labour, imprisoned by poverty
and excluded from any resource ownership. Had all this never happened I
have no doubt in my mind that blacks, too, would have formed their own
giant mining houses.

The liberation struggle waged by the oppressed masses of our country, led
by the ANC and its allies, was informed by the need to correct these social
and economic injustices. The rise of the trade union movement in the mining
industry was a direct response of the mineworkers to the effective
marginalisation of black workers as mere purveyors of cheap labour. The
early struggles of black mineworkers were throttled by the apartheid
regime. The mining sector, of course, sat at the heart of the apartheid
state, which denied black South Africans economic and political power in
their own country.

The spirit which inspired early mining unions is captured in the Freedom
Charter, drafted almost 57 years ago by hundreds of ordinary workers,
peasants, businesspersons, intellectuals, professionals, youth and women of
all nationalities. The Freedom Charter declares, and I quote:


  The mineral wealth beneath the soil shall be transferred to the ownership
  of the people as a whole.

The same spirit found further expression in the mass struggles of the 1970s
and, in the 1980s, in the rise of the biggest mining union in the world,
the National Union of Mineworkers.

Those of us who were inspired by the dedication of our forefathers and
mothers, by their fundamental values of freedom, equality and social
justice, by their heroism and resistance, believe and demand that the
injustice of our past, which is still part of the current mining
dispensation and industry, ought to be dealt with and will be dealt with
firmly, once and for all.

It is a known fact that minerals and the mining  industry  in  this  country
were built on the sweat and blood of the African people. If  today  we  were
to count the number of our people who gave their lives and sacrificed  their
families for this industry,  those  who  oppose  this  Bill,  including  the
official opposition, should realise that a failure  by  this  Parliament  to
bring about equity in this sector  would  amount  to  a  betrayal  of  their
legacy. We cannot allow their suffering to have been in vain.

Hundreds of our best comrades, the likes of comrade Johannes Nkosi, Moses
Kotane, Moses Mabida, Bram Fischer, Chief Albert Luthuli, J B Marx, A
Nzulu, J Nkosi, E T Mofutsanyana, Joe Slovo, Chris Hani, Oliver Tambo,
Govan Mbeki, Steven Tshwete, Peter Mokaba and many more gave their lives
for the freedom and social and economic emancipation of the African people
and all South Africans. [Applause.]

Mandela, Sisulu, Mbeki, Mhlaba, Goldberg, Kathrada, Motsoaledi and Mlangeni
- and many others, some of them present here, including our Deputy
President - were subjected to prolonged imprisonment and torture. Some were
even murdered. Vuyisile Mini, Khayingo, Ruth First, Joe Gqabi - all were
murdered for a simple sin: the desire for freedom and social and economic
justice and a place under the sun for their brothers and sisters.
[Interjections.]

Our struggle for social and economic justice culminated in the first
democratic election in 1994 and the adoption of a constitutional
dispensation which is the embodiment of the will of all South Africans,
black and white. This Constitution promotes the principles of equality and
enjoins the state to pass legislation to redress the results of past racial
discrimination. [Interjections.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: [Inaudible.]

Mr T M GONIWE: I am coming to you; just hold your horses.

Habitual liars have tried to deny the need to transform the minerals
industry. They would rather have us believe in our own oppression and
exploitation. They implored us to believe that there is nothing wrong with
the mining industry and that it does not need transformation. They argued
that skewed ownership patterns are good for the industry and the country.
The truth is that the current regulatory framework is only good for the
mining bosses and their puppets and the privileged few. [Interjections.]

To expect Africans in particular and blacks in general to be happy when the
current regulatory dispensation effectively limits them to menial and
dangerous jobs at low wages, when they effectively have no way to own and
benefit meaningfully from their own God-given heritage, a heritage for
which they have claimed their stake by pain, sacrifice, tears and blood is
not only futile but cruel, immoral and criminal. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Goniwe, your time expired long ago.

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Is it
parliamentary for an hon member of Parliament - I am sorry, I do not know
her name, but she is sitting behind the hon Mr Nash - to point her tongue
out and to wave her hands in the air? [Laughter.] Is that an appropriate
parliamentary form of expression? Perhaps you could rule on that.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Leon, I do not know about an hon member
sticking her tongue out. I would have to see it in the video, and then we
could determine whether it is parliamentary or not. Hon Goniwe, you make
take your seat.

Mr T M GONIWE: Madam Speaker, I just wanted to say that_

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Goniwe, your time has expired.

Mr T M GONIWE: _ the ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Madam Speaker, I must tell you that the lady who stuck her
tongue out and waved at me refers to me as her husband in the committee.
[Laughter.]

However, I wish to say something quite categoric at the outset of my
speech, and I want the ANC to listen and, more importantly, hear. The DP is
in favour of promoting equitable access for all South Africans to the
minerals of South Africa. It does believe in the rapid expansion of
opportunities for the historically disadvantaged. It does have a firm
agenda for the promotion of employment and the advancement of the social
and economic welfare of all South Africans.

These are not the issues here before us. What is at issue and what is in
this Bill, as currently constructed, separates these issues from
considerations of investment and investor confidence. These issues are
inextricably linked. Without investors, there will be no black economic
empowerment, no job creation, no wealth generation, no social upliftment
and no rural development. [Interjections.]

Mr T M GONIWE: We will do it ourselves.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: But first a word about the process. I must inform hon
members that the committee set out an exemplary public participation
process. Over 80 submissions were received, many of them detailed and with
constructive input. When the committee set out to deliberate, however, it
made a mockery of that process. Scant attention was paid to the inputs.
There was little debate and often, when a debate was attempted, the Chair
would purposefully say to his side of the House: ``Do we really want to
debate this? The ANC has already decided.'' This is clearly a new meaning
as far as steamrollering is concerned. The process was a disgrace and an
insult to those who submitted proposals and a perversion of the institution
of Parliament itself.

As for the Bill itself, firstly on the constitutional issue, cogent and
detailed submissions were made to the effect that the Bill, as it stood,
did constitute a direct assault on the property rights clauses of the
Constitution. Although attempts were made yesterday - I repeat, yesterday -
to overcome this, my advice is that the Bill remains fundamentally flawed.

In order to have an informed debate, the state law advisor was requested,
early on in the process, to table his opinion. We are still waiting. A
short verbal opinion was given which, quite frankly, had even ANC members,
for once, stunned into an embarrassed silence. It was an opinion short on
words and even shorter on substance.

Secondly, it is vital that those investing in our mining industry are
afforded adequate levels of security of tenure. While this has been
addressed in certain instances, it falls way short in others, namely what
area constitutes a mining right and the need to cater for natural
extensions to mining operations while preventing hoarding.

This was agreed at Mbulwa, but the Government is fast backtracking from it.
Our legislation needs to address the economics involved in deep and complex
mineral reefs which require massive investment and very long planning and
investment lead times. This Bill achieves just the opposite. The effect is
to discourage very large capital-intensive projects, with huge potential
job loses. Little wonder that the captains of the industry met in an
emergency session with members of the Cabinet over the weekend in a last-
minute attempt to achieve a breakthrough on this subject, but to no avail.

To compound the matter, pending applications under the current Minerals Act
are now to be considered under the new Act, prompting at least one mining
house, as the Minister said, to seek redress in the courts. Section 10
rights under the current Act, which were brushed aside by the chairman as
an irrelevance in the current proceedings, were about to be dropped until
it dawned on that side of the House that their exclusion would bring Iscor
to a grinding halt. Such is the level and the extent to which this Bill has
been thoroughly thought through.

Thirdly, while the Bill tightens up the whole question of ministerial
discretion in certain respects, in other respects, via the back door, it
opens it by linking the fulfilment of key objectives of the Bill - black
economic empowerment, the social plan and the new labour plan - to the most
important regulatory consents in the Bill, namely the granting of
prospecting and mining rights.

These objectives, despite what the Minister says, are vague and ill-
defined. We heard that and again across the representations to that
committee. Substance was to be given to these concepts in the form of a
charter negotiated with the industry. But when we came to finalising that
clause, the ANC, in a fit of pique and power-hungry vengeance, even
withdrew the requirement that the Minister must consult within the industry
in this regard.

Finally, redress to the courts is limited to the judicial review of
administrative decisions. An appeal in respect of the law or fact is
denied.

What this country needs is a Bill which promotes access to all and
addresses issues of empowerment and social objectives while, at the same
time, enhancing investor confidence by creating, in line with Nepad
objectives, a mining regime that is internationally competitive in every
possible respect. In this respect we have failed. [Applause.]

Mr E J LUCAS: Madam Speaker, for more than 100 years the mining industry
has formed the backbone of the South African economy. Over the period, the
industry has created hundreds of thousands of jobs, provided a lifeline for
millions of dependants and created and expanded the foundation for a modern
and a vibrant economy.

Even though certain sectors of the industry have been in decline over
recent years, the industry remains vital to South Africa's long-term
economic wellbeing. The importance of the mining industry cannot be
disputed, but it is also a fact that the industry benefited from apartheid
racial discrimination by entrenching patterns of ownership and excluded the
majority of South Africans.

Although some progress has been made since the early 1990s, ownership in
the industry is still dominated by a minority. Clearly this situation has
to change. Another historical development that characterises our mining
industry is the fact that mineral rights are owned by private persons and
the state. While some may argue that dual ownership of mineral rights has
enabled the successful development of mining in our country, it is also a
fact that the private ownership of these rights is limiting opportunities
for new entrants and new investors to gain meaningful access to the
industry.

The Bill, therefore, seeks to transform the mining industry in such a
manner that it is brought into line with the realities of the new South
Africa, particularly in respect of broadening the ownership base and
empowering the historically disadvantaged. The IFP supports these
overriding objectives and we therefore support the Bill. [Applause.]

Notwithstanding our generous support, the IFP must express certain
reservations and concerns about the Bill. Black economic empowerment is
obviously vital to the long-term success of the economy and indeed our
democracy. But black economic empowerment should not be boardroom
empowerment, where only a select group of historically disadvantaged
persons benefit. It also should not mean the exclusive creation of a new
range of so-called junior miners or small miners only. Empowerment should
mean meaningful participation for historically disadvantaged persons - very
importantly, communities - in the ownership and management of mining
ventures that will benefit all concerned.

Mining requires billions of rands in initial and ongoing investment and
years of preparatory work before the first profits are realised. Our
concern is that the investment requirements of modern mining will have the
effect of limiting access to the industry for historically disadvantaged
persons who do not have the necessary means to raise the necessary funding.
If this proves to be the case, the objective of the Bill empowering
historically disadvantaged persons will not be met. I do note that the Bill
has made some arrangements for financial support.

The question of royalties currently being received by communities from
mining operations is a very sensitive one. The IFP feels that the state
should ensure that royalties are ploughed back into the communities from
which they are derived. If this does not happen, previously disadvantaged
communities may find themselves further disadvantaged and disempowered.

The Bill provides that current recipients of royalties will continue to
receive them for a period of at least five years if certain criteria are
met. The IFP welcomes this amendment but questions why the period has been
limited to five years and why no provision has been made for the
possibility of new recipients of royalties in future.

The IFP welcomes the fact that the Bill provides for the creation of a
socioeconomic empowerment charter that will establish a framework, targets
and timetable for the entry of historically disadvantaged persons into the
mining industry. However, the ruling party decided at the very last minute
that the Minister will not have to consult stakeholders on the charter. The
IFP must object strenuously to this ill-considered move.

Since 1994, a prominent feature of our young democracy has been thorough
consultation between all stakeholders on matters of policy and law. It is a
mystery why the ruling party suddenly decided that in this instance, no
consultation should take place on this vital charter. This certainly was
not the case when a similar charter was negotiated in the liquid fuels
industry. The IFP can only express its sincerest hope that the Minister
will consult the industry on the contents of the charter. We acknowledge
that she has always walked the extra mile as far as consultation is
concerned. We are confident that this will again be the case.

The constitutionality of certain provisions of the Bill has been hotly
debated both inside and outside Parliament. The Minister has on numerous
occasions stated the Government's firm belief that the Bill is in line with
the Constitution. Other affected parties have equally strongly stated their
belief that the Bill is unconstitutional. It should, therefore, come as no
surprise if the Bill is challenged in the Constitutional Court before long.

Mining, like all other business ventures, suffers from uncertainty in the
legislative and regulatory framework within which operations must be
conducted. Doubts about the constitutionality of the Bill are just one
manifestation of such uncertainty. The IFP would therefore respectfully
suggest to the Minister that it would be in the interest of all
stakeholders that the Bill be referred to the Constitutional Court by the
Government before it is implemented.

Finally, the IFP feels it was unnecessary for the Bill to be processed by
Parliament almost with undue haste. We accept that legislative certainty
should prevail sooner rather than later, but the fact is that the Bill
cannot be implemented before the accompanying money Bill is approved by
Parliament or before the Minister has published the necessary regulations.
Surely these practical considerations would have made it possible for
Parliament to spend a little more time fine-tuning the Bill. As it is, we
can only hope that all possibilities have been covered and that no
unintended consequences will result from the Bill.

In closing, I want to reiterate an earlier statement: Although we have some
reservations and concerns, the IFP will support the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon members, ke
dumedisa dikgosi tsa heso tsa Bafokeng, tsa Bakwena le tsa Bakgatla.
[Ditlatse.] [... I greet our chiefs from the Bafokeng clan and the Bakgatla
clan.  [Applause.]

We greet the representatives mining industry, who have been with us here
throughout the deliberations. I also want to greet the black businesspeople
that yesterday broke ranks and stood up for the truth and justice.
[Applause.] We thank them very much. I also want to greet oomama naboobaba
abalapha namhlanje [the mothers and fathers who are here today], because
today we have come to celebrate the Freedom Charter. [Applause.]

The passing of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill in this
House today, and in the NCOP tomorrow, signifies the celebration of the
Freedom Charter adopted at the Congress of the People on 26 June 1955 in
Kliptown. The passing of this Bill on the eve of Freedom Charter Day ushers
in a new dawn of transformation for our economy.

In the Congress of the People, 47 years ago, our people declared that``the
people shall share in the country's wealth'', and that the national wealth
of our country, the heritage of South Africans, shall be restored to the
people''. This Bill gives effect to the aspirations of our people.

Today, I want to pay tribute to our mineworkers, who have paid with their
blood and their lives so that South Africa can be where it is today.
[Applause.] I also wish that all of us would remember -

... ooNohombile, ooMaNyawuza, ooMamtaung, ooMamkoena nooMamkhize abafelwe
ngamadoda abo ngokuthi awelwe yitafile ngaphantsi emigodini yegolide,
eyeplatinum okanye idayimani. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

Emveni koko, ndiza kuthi gqaba gqaba ukuchaza ukuba lo Mthetho uYilwayo

ukugqibezela ngophando phaya kuqabane uGoniwe ngembali yemigodi nento

follows.)

[Ms L M T XINGWANA: The Nohambiles, whose husbands have died by being
buried in gold, platinum and diamond mines when these collapse. [Applause.]

After that, I will briefly explain what this Bill has to offer us, women.
However, before that, I would like to report to comrade Goniwe on the
research conducted about the history of mines and the impact they had on
women and children of Africa.]

The discovery of minerals in South Africa resulted in the creation of the
migrant labour system by the colonial and racist governments of the day in
collusion with the captains of the mining industry and the agricultural
sector. The advent of the migrant labour system resulted in the
socioeconomic underdevelopment of our rural areas, and the impoverishment
of the African people and their families, as African men were forced to go
and work in the mines, leaving their wives to bring up their children alone
in abject poverty over long periods of time. [Interjections.]

Alizange, eli lungu elihloniphekileyo, limshiye lona umfazi walo elamba.
Lihlala nomfazi walo iiyure ezingama-24 bonke ubomi balo. [The hon member
did not have to leave his wife behind hungry. He stays with his wife 24
hours a day all his life.]

That is not happening to our mineworkers. [Applause.]

The women's role was virtually to reproduce future generations of cheap,
unskilled, poorly paid labour for the mining industry, the agricultural
sector and other industries. Today, eight years after our hard-won
democracy, 70% of the hostels in the mines are still single-sex hostels.
The long forced separation of our families has had a devastating effect on
African family life and has destroyed the social fabric of rural African
communities, where children grew up without their fathers, who only came
home when they were old, sick and about to die ... ... kuthiwe utata
watshipha, waphelela eRhawutini, kungachazwa iingxaki naye utata ajongene
nazo. [... it would be said that the father deserted his family and went to
stay permanently in Gauteng, and the difficulties he experienced never
would be mentioned.]

The single-sex hostels have also contributed in no small measure to the
current HIV/Aids pandemic. HIV/Aids infection rates in mining areas, for
example Carletonville, are 60% to 70% - over three times higher than the
national average. Although most mining houses have embarked on HIV/Aids
campaigns, single-sex hostels lead to prostitution, which is also very high
in the mining areas and has resulted in these high HIV levels.

Again, the mining industry must take responsibility for these problems. It
is sad to note that this has occurred against the backdrop of massive
wealth accumulation by the captains of the mining industry and increasing
suffering, hunger, disease and poverty for our people.

One just needs to look at the neighbourhoods of the mining areas such as
Cullinan. Cullinan is a little England. They have little English houses,
little English cars, little English doors, everything a little English
museum, when just outside there our people are languishing in poverty.
Galeshewe is the same and also our labour-sending areas such as the former
Transkei, northern Natal, the Limpopo province, Lesotho and others; one
stares poverty in the face when one comes to these areas.

The areas are devastated by famine, cholera, TB, HIV/Aids and illiteracy.
Not much has been done by the mining houses to improve matters and to
alleviate the suffering in the former Transkei, in Welkom right now, in
Galeshewe and in many other areas where our people are languishing in
poverty. My own grandfather died of phthisis and TB as a pauper in the
Transkei after spending his life-time in the goldmines in Johannesburg.
[Interjections.]

I also want to address the biltong issue. Let me quote from the Minister's
speech on her Budget Vote:


  ... one white company is holding 63% of South Africa's platinum reserves.
  In manganese, only two white companies hold 83% of the total manganese
  reserves and in the gold, also two white companies hold 51% of the total
  reserves. In diamonds, one white company controls 95% of South Africa's
  production.

Abanantloni. [They are not ashamed.] [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Those who are asking for biltong still want some more, over and above 80%,
60% umntu emnye. [per person.] [Laughter.] Is this justice? Is this
fairness?

Hayi, thina asiwufuni lo mqwayito, othi makutye umntu abe mnye nomkakhe.
Futhi lo mqwayito womile, awunawo nomhluzi. [Kwahlekwa.]

Thina sikhule kuxhelwa emakhaya, sikhule kubizwa abantu xa kuxheliwe,
inyama ithatyathwe ibekwe esithebeni, ifike indoda nemela yayo, isike,

Amakhosikazi amaxhaphetshu KwaZulu-Natal emba udongwe, amalahle eNew
Castle, eNdwedwe. Amakhosikazi, ngoku emba igolide eBarbaton. Amakhosikazi

UMphathiswa ubathumela ngomso oku eIndiya, besiya kuqeqeshelwa ukukwazi
ukwenza eziya zitya, bazizobe, singaphindi sizithenge eItaly, singaphindi
sizithenge eNgilani. [Kwaqhwatywa] Siza kuzithenga apha ekhaya. Siza kudala
amathuba empangelo.

Amakhosikazi athi ukuba uplatinum akayifuni le platinum nale dayimani
makayizise apha kuwo. Akaxakekanga wona; anguVukuzenzele. Akasayi kuthi
thina asingabo abathengisi bamajikazi, singabembi-migodi. Asisayi kuzuza.
Kudala sazuza ngexesha likaCharlotte Maxeke singooVukuzenzele, sizenzela.
Aza kuzenzela amakhosikazi, Mphathiswa.

Asisayi kubanika lo mqwayito. Sidiniwe kukudibana nedayimani yethu sele
iseNgilani, singayazi ukuba iye kanjani. Sidibana negolide eNgilani kunye
neemoto eJamani. Sifuna ihlale apha le ntsimbi yenza injini, siyiqale
phantsi injini yemoto. Ndicela uMphathiswa wezoRhwebo noShishino
noMphathiswa weZemali bahlangane noMphathiswa weZimbiwa naMandla. Kwithuba

Zii-SMMEs ngapha namakhosikazi. Zininzi iinkampani ezifuna ukusinceda.
OoCorobrick balapha eMzantsi Afrika benza ilinge lokuseka ishishini kunye
namakhosikazi, ooTyco baseAustralia, ooAfro-ore baseKhanada. Ziintsomi ezi
zithethwa apha lilungu elihloniphekileyo uDavidson ezithi abatyali-zimali
bayabaleka. Ufanele kukuba uhlala eMars, akahlali apha kule planethi yethu.
Abatyali-zimali bahleli apha eMzantsi Afrika, yaye baqhubela phambili.

[No, we do not want this biltong that can be had only by a man and his
wife. And, this biltong is dry; it does not even have gravy. [Applause.]

We grew up in homes where we used to slaughter, and the meat would be put
in reed trays, a man would take out his knife, cut a piece, cut pieces for
the children, and there would be reed trays of meat for women too. We say:
Daughter of the Mlambo clan, take the nation's meat and put it on a tray
and let the people eat. [Applause.]

It is utter nonsense and a lie that investors are running away from this
country. Women are busy digging clay, coal in New Castle, at Ndwedwe.
Women, at this moment, are miners in Barberton. Women need to be trained to
do pottery so that they could make roof tiles, bricks and wall tiles.

The hon the Minister is sending them to India, they will be leaving
tomorrow to attain training in making these dishes and decorate them, so
that we do not have to buy them from Italy and England any longer. We will
buy them here, at home, in our country. We are going to create jobs.
Women say that if platinum magnates do not want platinum and  diamond,  they
should bring it to them. They are not that busy to take up that  task;  they
have taken up the Vukuzenzele campaign. They will not say that they  do  not
sell necklaces, but are miners. We shall not  gain.  We  have  been  gaining
since the time of Charlotte Maxeke, doing for ourselves. Women are going  to
do things for themselves, hon Minister.

We shall not give them this biltong. We are not content with the fact that
we find our diamond in England, not knowing how it got there. We find our
gold in England and cars in Germany. We want the steel that is used to make
cars to remain here; we want to build a car from scratch. I would like to
appeal to the hon the Minister of Trade and Industry and the hon the
Minister of Finance to meet with the hon the Minister of Minerals and
Energy. In ten years time, we should be able to produce a car from its
beginning in South Africa. [Applause.]

On the other side it is SMMEs and women. There are many companies that want
to assist us. Companies like Corobrick based in South Africa are making an
effort in conjunction with women, to establish business; Tyco from
Australia is another one as well as Afro-ore from Canada. The hon member Mr
Davidson is only telling folktales when he says investors are withdrawing.
He must be living in Mars, and not on the same planet as us. Investors are
in South Africa to stay and they are making progress.]

They have set aside funds to assist in empowering our people. They are
ready for joint ventures and are waiting to talk to the Minister.

UMphathiswa simnika iinyanga ezintathu. Eziya nyanga zintandathu zinde.

[We give the hon the Minister three months. The period of six months is too
long. She should complete that document. The hon the Minister will be open
to ideas and suggestions. One must not be too busy; one should be
available. We would like to finalise this matter. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]]

Mr A H NEL: Madam Speaker, let me say upfront, so that there can be no
misunderstanding, that we support the objects of the Bill in so far as
there must be equitable access to mineral and petroleum resources and the
opportunities for previously disadvantaged persons must be substantial and
meaningful. We also support the promotion of economic growth and employment
and the advancement of the social and economic welfare of all South
Africans. I know no one, here in Parliament or outside in the industry, who
does not agree with this.

What we in the New NP cannot support is the structure of the Bill, in that
it may affect the right to own property, and we believe that mineral rights
are property rights.

Dit is 'n uiters belangrike stuk wetgewing wat vandag hier voor ons dien,
want dit raak nie slegs die mynbedryf nie, maar ons ganse ekonomie.
Alhoewel die mynbedryf nie vandag meer so 'n groot deel van die BBP uitmaak
soos vroeÃ«r nie, is dit een van die vertakkings van die ekonomie wat die
meeste buitelandse investering trek. Om diÃ© rede is die persepsie wat die
onderhawige wetgewing, wat oor eiendoms- en besitreg gaan, gaan skep, van
die uiterste belang. Die struktuur van die wetgewing maak dit baie duidelik
dat die staat die bewaarder van die mineraalbronne van Suid-Afrika is. DiÃ©
feit beteken nie per se dat die staat die regte op die bronne oorneem nie,
maar wanneer 'n mens verder daarop let dat diÃ© wetgewing alle verwysings na
mineraalregte in vorige wette of dele van wette verwyder, begin kuratorskap
'n heel ander betekenis kry.

Die wyse waarop die struktuur van die wetgewing onsekerheid bring ten
opsigte van die besitreg van minerale, kan mos nie vir ons land goed wees
nie. Uiteenlopende menings bestaan oor of die bewaring wat die staat oor
die mineraalbronne oorneem, neerkom op onteiening, en of die
vergoedingsbepaling voldoende is om te beantwoord aan artikel 25(2) van die
Grondwet. Bekende regspraktisyns het 'n baie sterk saak uitgemaak as sou
die wetgewing onteiening teweegbring, en nie voldoen aan die reg op besit
van eiendom, soos vervat in die Grondwet, nie.

Die staatsregsadviseurs het weer gesÃª dat die staat die reg het om
mineraalregte te ontneem, soos vervat in artikel 25(1) van die Grondwet,
omdat die staat 'n verpligting het om die natuurlike hulpbronne in die land
billiker te verdeel. Ek is nie 'n regsgeleerde nie, maar my
regverdigheidsin sÃª vir my dat, ondanks die feit dat ek saamstem dat
natuurlike hulpbronne beter verdeel moet word, die staat nie sy
verpligtinge, soos in die Grondwet verwoord, kan afskuif op gewone mense
wat regte volgens legitieme wette bekom het nie. Een van die
medevoorsitters van die komitee se mening was dat sekerheid oor of die
wetgewing aan die voorskrifte van die Grondwet beantwoord, slegs deur die
Konstitusionele Hof uitgewys kan word. Ek stem daarmee saam. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follow.)

[It is an extremely important piece of legislation that is before us today,
because it does not only concern the mining industry, but our entire
economy. Although today the mining industry does not form such a large part
of the GDP as it did before, it is one of the sections of the economy which
attract the most offshore investment. For this reason the perception that
this legislation is going to create, which concerns the right of possession
and ownership, is of the utmost importance. The structure of the
legislation makes it very clear that the state is the custodian of the
mineral resources of South Africa. This fact does not mean that the state
is taking over the rights to the resources per se, but when one notes that
the legislation removes all references to mineral rights in previous laws
or parts of laws then custodianship starts getting a completely different
meaning.

The manner in which the structure of the legislation brings about
uncertainty with regard to right of possession of minerals surely can not
be good for our country. Then there are different opinions about whether
the custodianship of the mineral resources, taken over by the state,
amounts to expropriation and whether the compensation clause would be a
sufficient answer to section 25(2) of the Constitution. Well-known law
practitioners have made a strong case that the legislation brings about
expropriation and does not comply with the right to ownership of property
as contained in the Constitution.

On the other hand, constitutional law advisors have said that the state has
the right to expropriate mineral rights, as contained in section 25(1) of
the Constitution, because the state has a responsibility to distribute the
natural resources in the country more fairly. I am not a lawyer, but my
sense of justice tells me that, apart from the fact that I agree that
natural resources should be better divided, the state can not devolve its
responsibilities, as expressed in the Constitution, on ordinary people who
obtained rights in terms of legitimate laws. The opinion of one of the co-
chairpersons of the committee was that certainty on the legislation that
must answer to the prescriptions of the Constitution can only be identified
by the Constitutional Court. I agree with this.]

The question that we must ask is: Is there another way? I think there is.
We all know that land and mineral rights have been taken away from
indigenous people in the past. We have tried to redress the land issue by
passing legislation in this House to achieve land restitution. And we
follow a policy of land reform to get a more equitable ownership of land.

But, in the case of minerals, through this Bill, we take away people's
rights, even those of communities like the Bafokeng. [Interjections.] I
think this is wrong. The Minister should have made use of methods like
restitution and reform to get a more equitable dispensation. Instead, she
uses methods, through this Bill, which could probably divert foreign
investment to countries which have more friendly systems and security of
tenure.

We are in a global economy, whether we like it or not, and the Minister
should take cognisance of that. The fight in the world today is to lure
foreign capital to one's country with incentives and friendly regulations,
not chase them away with prescriptions of how they may or may not use their
money.

Ter afsluiting, wil ek sÃª baie verbeteringe is aan die wetgewing
aangebring. Hiertoe het alle betrokkenes, asook komiteelede van alle
partye, meegehelp. Dit is nogtans 'n jammerte dat, nÃ¡ 'n lang proses van
meer as twee jaar, die indruk gewek is dat die afhandeling van die
wetgewing deurgehaas word. Met meer tyd tot hul beskikking, kon die
komitee, die departement en alle betrokkenes met beter wetgewing na vore
gekom het.

Ons sal die wetgewing steun, met tekortkomings en al. [Applous.] Stadig!
Stadig! Ons sal dit steun indien geen onsekerheid bestaan oor die
aantasting van die eiendomsbepaling in die Grondwet nie. Daarom doen ons 'n
beroep op die Minister om die Regering se erns oor die regte in die
Grondwet te bewys deur die President te adviseer om diÃ© wetgewing na die
Grondwetlike Hof te verwys voordat hy dit onderteken. Ek herhaal: so 'n
onderneming sal dit vir ons moontlik maak om die onderhawige wetgewing te
steun. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In conclusion I would like to say that many improvements have been made to
the legislation. All role-players, including committee members of all
parties, contributed to this. It is regrettable, however that after a long
process of more than two years, the impression has been created that the
finalisation of the legislation is being rushed. With more time, the
committee, the department and the role-players could have come up with
better legislation.
We will support the legislation, warts and all. [Applause.] Slowly, slowly!
We will support it if there is no uncertainty regarding the way the
property clause in the Constitution is affected. That is why we are
appealing to the Minister to prove the Government's seriousness regarding
the rights in the Constitution by advising the President to refer this
legislation to the Constitutional Court before signing it. I repeat: Such
an undertaking would enable us to support this legislation. [Applause.]]

Mna M N RAMODIKE: Ke a go leboga, mohlomphegi MotlatÅ¡a-Sepikara. Maloba ge

[Mr M N RAMODIKE: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Some time ago, during
the Codesa negotiations, at Kempton Park, those of us who participated in
the negotiations agreed unanimously that the new national Constitution must
give black people, Africans, mineral rights in the land of their birth. The
constitutional amendment which the Minister is bringing to this House gives
black people mineral rights in the land of their birth. It is not taking it
away from them! The UDM supports the Bill. [Applause.]]

We indeed recognise that the task of drafting this Bill and piloting it
through to Parliament has been tough, long and bumpy. The UDM appreciates
the inclusion of preferent, prospecting or mining rights in respect of
communities in terms of clause 104 and the inclusion of exemptions from
certain provisions of the Act.

These clauses address the concerns expressed by the UDM in our written
submission, in which we made some proposals concerning the land surface
rights. These clauses will, to some extent, redress the injustices flowing
from the failure of the previous colonial and apartheid regimes to afford
recognition and dignity to land rights held in terms of indigenous law.

The UDM recognises that the fundamental principles of this Bill are,
indeed, internationally accepted and that the Bill seeks to address the
inequalities, imbalances and injustices of the past. The UDM also
recognises that the Bill seeks to eradicate all forms of discriminatory
practices in the mineral and petroleum industries.

We recall the special provisions of the constitutions which governed the
former bantustans during those dark days of apartheid which were designed
to reserve matters for legislation and administration by the former self-
governing territories, and specifically mineral and land rights. These
provisions prevented and prohibited black people from owning mineral and
mining rights and from having any say in matters related to mining. Black
leaders and all black South Africans were placed in invidious and
precarious positions, and were made aliens in the land of their birth. This
was one of the worst types of oppression, suppression and depression by the
former apartheid regime.

The Bill seeks to address that bitterness and those atrocities. It is
against this background that the UDM finds it difficult to oppose the
Government's commitment to transform the mineral and petroleum industries
in South Africa. We support the Bill. [Applause.] We welcome in particular
the expansion of opportunities for historically disadvantaged persons to
enter the mineral and petroleum industries to benefit from the exploitation
of the nation's mineral resources. Our emphasis in this regard is that the
mineral wealth should benefit the communities in whose area mining takes
place.

Gone are the days when our people were only regarded as reservoirs from
which privileged and lily-white mining companies could draw labour. Our
people support black economic empowerment and they want to be capacitated.

South Africans should learn from Zimbabwe. The delay in the implementation
of the land programme in Zimbabwe has led to today's political crisis. We
want an amicable transformation of the mining industry in this country, and
not the Zimbabwean way of doing things.

The key areas of concern for various stakeholders and the mining industry
during the public hearings were security of tenure and the
constitutionality of the Bill. There is a remedy or solution to the latter,
namely to establish whether the Bill is constitutional or not. Instead of
holding this important Bill to ransom, the UDM proposes that the President
should refer the Bill to the Constitutional Court for a decision on its
constitutionality. Security of tenure means that the mineral rights holder
must have an adequate period within which to carry out exploration and/or
mining operations, that he or she has a virtually automatic right to mine,
subject to compliance with applicable regulations, and, finally, that there
are clear obligations in order to maintain his or her rights, subject to
clear and objective cancellation criteria.

This Bill provides for an exploratory licence term of five years and a
mining period of 30 years. In comparison with Latin America and African
countries, this Bill is very reasonable and the UDM supports it.
[Applause.]

Ms N S MTSWENI: Madam Speaker, hon members,and the hon the Minister,
silotjhisa emakhosini sithokoza bona nibe nathi namhlanje.[We pass our
greetings to the Chiefs. We are grateful that they are here with us today.]
South Africa is well endowed with world-class mineral resources and mining
operations. Minerals will continue to play a central role in the
development of our economy.

Geologists estimate that half of our minerals endowment has been used up in
the last hundred years. We have no time to waste in ensuring that the other
half is used in truly developing the nation as a whole. The development of
our world-class resources depends, to a large extent, on opening up access
to investment from both local and international sources.

We must  replace  the  current  apartheid-era  system  with  a  system  that
promotes transparency and  access  and  ensures  that  the  mining  industry
contributes to  national  development.  We  need  a  world-class  regulatory
framework to ensure this. Those who feel  threatened  by  change  have  said
that what we are proposing to do is unusual and very risky. I  will  compare
the Bill with the regulatory system in a few  other  countries  where  these
companies happily do business.

According to the World Bank's estimates in Strategy for Africa 1992,
virtually all African states have used the approach which can be called
``permanent sovereignty'' over their natural resources in line with various
UN resolutions in early 1960s. This approach is in common with all
countries in the world, and does not prevent the allocation of secure,
legal mining rights to private parties, nor does it imply that the rights
cannot be tradable.

However, it does establish that the state can regulate access to resources
and has a legitimate interest in the manner of its exploitation.

Security and continuity of tenure of mineral rights is essential if there
is to be sufficient incentive to undertake high-risk exploration with
substantial work commitment and then marshal the large sums necessary for
development. The investor needs to be assured of the right to proceed from
exploration to mining, provided predefined criteria are met.

The mining licence must be of sufficient duration and secure enough to make
the exploration and development commitment worthwhile. Typically an
exploration licence may be for a period of three years with possibly one or
two renewals for the same period, whereas mining licences might be for a
period of 20-30 years with similar renewal periods.

In a paper presented in an International Bar Association conference,
Professor Cameron defined security of tenure as ``a reasonable legal
entitlement for extraction rights after successful completion of the
exploration phase.'' In fact, the Bill provides fair administrative action
by setting objective criteria to provide predictability and guide the
Minister on how to exercise his or her discretion. For instance, the Bill
provides that the Minister must grant or refuse applications for mining
rights when certain criteria and requirements have been met, whereas in
other foreign countries where some of our mining companies happily invest
billions, the Minister's discretion is extremely wide.

The Bill has opened up opportunities for new entrants and enables them to
partner with existing companies. Many foreign investors have already
embarked on joint ventures with these companies. They are applauded for
this initiative.

The ANC cannot overlook the international campaign against the Bill that
was orchestrated by the big mining industries in South Africa. The ANC
wishes to remind everybody in the House that a mineral is a national asset
and, hence, government is the custodian. This is not a new concept; in most
countries mineral rights are vested in the state, as I will illustrate.

The Bill provides for security of tenure which compares favourably with the
security of tenure provided for in legislation abroad.

One of the key pillars of this Bill is to bring the South African mining
legislative and regulatory framework in line with the international best
practice. In Australia, for example, prospecting licences may be granted
for a period of four years, with no specific provision made for renewal.
For mining the period is 21 years and can be renewed for another 21 years.
In Namibia a prospecting licence is granted for three years, renewable for
another two years. A mining licence is granted for 25 years and is
renewable for another 15 years. No licence for life for mining is
envisaged. In Zambia the licence is granted for 25 years and renewable for
a further period of 25 years. This is also the situation in Tanzania. In
Canada a mining licence may be granted for a period of 20 years and renewed
for a further period of 10 years. In South Africa, by contrast, we give a
generous renewable period of 30 years.

In all these countries, access to the mineral source is granted by the
state concerned. Security of tenure is not dependent on a mineral right
being granted for the life of the mine. There is no reason why we should do
otherwise. In terms of the Bill, the granted rights are transferable and,
tradable and can be mortgaged to facilitate funding for projects. If one
compares it with the situation in foreign mining countries - Australia, for
instance - transferability is subject to the Minister's approval.

The same applies to Botswana, Zambia, Tanzania and Canada. Therefore the
approach that South Africa has taken is in fact in line with the rest of
the world.
In conclusion, our particular apartheid-era mineral rights system has
resulted in a few companies owned by a tiny white elite controlling the
whole industry and not allowing smaller or new entrants. Contrary to the
hysteria from the established industry, investors are queuing up to invest
in South Africa's mining industry and after today there will be more
security of tenure and more transparency. This Bill will ensure that this
development benefits the nation, generating jobs and developing and
empowering millions of our people.

Truly, this is a better life for all. The ANC supports this Bill.
[Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, die VF sal nie die onderhawige
wetsontwerp steun nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] As `n mens eerlik wil wees, dui
dit op niks anders nie as 'n nasionaliseringsproses, en hoewel die VF nie
in die komitee dien nie, wil die VF sy standpunt baie duidelik stel. Die
agb Minister kom na vore en sÃª dat daar wel vergoeding sal wees vir sover
dit mineraalregte betref. Die vraag is: vergoeding uit wie se perspektief?
DiÃ© van die agb Minister? In die huidige stadium het die hele debat in
verband met diÃ© wetsontwerp ontaard in 'n rassedebat, met die groot
mynmaatskappye aan die een kant en, aan die ander kant, die
swartbemagtigingsmaatskappye.

Die agb Minister lees klaarblyklik nie die koerant nie. Sy weet nie wat
aangaan nie. Dit is die werklikheid, want 'n ander aspek is ook dat dit nie
net oor swart bemagtiging gaan nie. Die mineraalsektor is een van diÃ© groot
werkgewers in die land wat reeds werk verskaf. Die vraag is: gaan dit hier
werklik oor swart bemagtiging of gaan dit eerder om 'n paar swartes wat net
nÃ³g verder verryk gaan word?

In my wÃªreld, Noordwes, is daar baie delwers wie se bestaan en voortbestaan
afhanklik is daarvan. Die vraag is net in watter opsig hulle behoorlik
vergoed gaan word, ook vir hulle mineraalregte.

Die laaste vraag is: hoekom is dit so dat diÃ© wetsontwerp nou skielik deur
die Parlement gevoer moet word? Hoekom kon daar nie nog verder gepraat word
met die groter rolspelers nie? Sodoende kon ons verseker dat 'n behoorlike
ooreenkoms bereik word, sodat, met behoorlike konsensus, met diÃ© ingrypende
wetgewing vorentoe gegaan kan word? [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, the FF will not support this Bill.
[Interjections.] If one wants to be honest, then this is nothing more than
a nationalisation process and although the FF does not serve on the
committee, the FF wants to put it very clearly: The hon Minister comes
forward and says that there will indeed be compensation with regards to
mineral rights. The question is: Compensation from whose perspective? That
of the hon Minister? At this stage the whole debate around this Bill
degenerated into a racial debate with the big mining companies on the one
side and on the other side, the black empowerment companies.

The hon the Minister clearly does not read the paper. She does not know
what is going on. This is the reality, because another aspect is also that
this is not only about black empowerment. The mineral sector is one of the
biggest employers in the country which already provides work. The question
is: Is this really about black empowerment or rather about a few blacks who
are going to be enriched even more?
In my world, North West, there are many miners whose existence and survival
are dependent upon this. The question is in which respect they will be
compensated properly, also for their mineral rights.

The last question is: Why is it so that this Bill must now suddenly be
pushed through Parliament? Why could we not have further talks on this with
the bigger roleplayers? By so doing we could have ensured that a proper
agreement was reached so that we could have gone ahead with consensus with
this incisive legislation. [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, the next speaker will be
making her maiden speech. [Applause.] Hon member, you may proceed. This is
the welcome that you have received in Parliament. It is a noisy Parliament,
but one learns to cope with it.

Ms J MOLOI: Chairperson, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, we present here
today a Bill that seeks to radically transform the South African economy
and bring about major changes, particularly the transformation of
infrastructural development.
This Bill seeks to redress the monotonously racial ownership within the
mining industry, which has been left in the hands of a few individuals over
a period of many years. It has been left unregulated, something which is
amazing, with no consideration of human resource development. Mining did
not consider that those who were working in the mines were human beings who
also needed to benefit from that industry.

Because mining is risky and unsafe, thousands of mineworkers have died. We
all know the sad stories about what happens in the mines and workers faced
with unhealthy living and working conditions. This industry has been
reaping the benefit of the mineworkers' sweat, leaving their poor families
to care for them on their way to the grave, owing to the unhealthy working
conditions. After they have worked themselves to exhaustion they go home
without anything in their pockets and are merely burdens to their families.
This is a situation we could not endure indefinitely.

This Bill comes at a time when South Africa is faced with the mammoth task
of not selfishly transforming just itself, but meeting the challenge of
transforming the entire African continent. That is one of the major
questions and challenges that are passed back to the South African
Government at this point in time.

Can we come up with a sustainable economy that actually proves that we are
able to drive the transformation aspect on the African continent? The
implementation of aspects of this Bill will serve as a statement to the
whole world to prove that as South Africans we have the potential and the
capacity to sustain ourselves economically. This therefore cannot serve as
a battlefield. We cannot afford that, considering the seriousness of the
challenges that are facing us. We have to really take this quite seriously.

When we achieve this goal it will mean that we then have a key to open many
other doors that will bring about major challenges for the poor in this
country. This Bill does not only look at black economic empowerment in
order to deracialise capital. It is not limited to that. It also focuses on
the social plan that seeks to develop the communities where mining
operations are taking place. It has therefore introduced a new aspect,
namely that of broad-based socioeconomic empowerment. This aspect is
captured in Chapter 7, clause 100 of this Bill. This becomes a reason for
all of us to celebrate the introduction of this law. It looks at all
spheres of society, both the BEE, which is black economic empowerment, and
the socioeconomic aspect.

What does broad-based socioeconomic empowerment mean to our ordinary
people? No more shall we have foreign investors digging our minerals and
leaving ghost mines, ghost towns and unhealthy mine pollution. That is
tantamount to looting and it is unacceptable.

I would just pause to refer to a very practical situation that is known
about by all South Africans and happened in two of the provinces in this
country. In Limpopo the communities of Penche and Mafefe were affected by
the asbestos mine which was left by the foreign mine investor from Britain
and people working there were infected and went home very ill. There were
no health plans put in place for them or anything that could help them. It
also affected a community in the Northern Cape. The two premiers from these
two provinces had to go to Britain and argue this case and fight for these
people.
This situation cannot be tolerated. It shows that it is necessary to
regulate this industry in order to avoid this kind of scenario. This case
went on for a long time and it took a lot of time and money to ensure that
the people were covered in terms of health conditions that affected them so
badly. I am sure we all now agree that we cannot leave this situation
unregulated.

Since this industry will be regulated, all the mining activities should
meet the outlined requirements, which include a social and labour plan. Let
me just amplify the importance of having a labour plan. What will happen
when all the resources are exhausted? Life cannot only be limited to
digging out the minerals. We need to be sure about what will happen if
those all reserves have been taken out.

Communities will be involved in skills training with the introduction of
this Bill. Technology, business partnerships and mainly the development of
co-operatives will change the lives of the needy and the poor. There will
be a lot of life and activities that will be taking place in order to
ensure that we redress the poor state and conditions of our people. The
labour plan will introduce the new concept of considering mineworkers an
important human resource factor entitled to a human resource skills
development plan. There should be a plan for dealing with skills
development in this industry.

An employment equity compliance plan is also needed and will have to be
monitored. Housing plans for employees are needed so that we move away from
the ridiculous single-unit cells. We all know that in the past there were
hostels where our dignified men were subjected to living conditions that
were quite horrible. The unfortunate part is that the dignity of the men
was reduced to nothing in those hostels. We therefore say that the
introduction of this Bill should ensure a housing plan for employees.

A health and safety plan which includes combating HIV/Aids will also be
part of the package. It is also important, from time to time, to introduce
the literacy aspect within the mining industry. The literacy programme
within the mining industry is significant and the implementation of the
Bill will activate the mining sector. At the moment, statistics from the
Mining qualifications Authority, and these are quote recent, tell us that
99,68% are black males, 1,26% are females and 0,67% are disabled. We have
to improve these statistics.

This reminds me that through the initiatives that the NUM embarked on, a
pilot project was conducted to involve women and see how they could fund
themselves in the mine, without disadvantaging them and assuming that they
may not be able to make it. That project needs to be supported in order for
us to ensure that they are also asserted within this male domain.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking time
has expired.

Ms J MOLOI: I would like to conclude by saying: Mayibuye! [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: For the hon member's education, when
the orange light begins to flash, it means that you have to start winding
up.

The hon member Rev Tolo has drawn my attention to the fact that up in the
gallery there are a number of young children who have travelled all the way
from the Sekhukhune district in the Limpopo province. I am quite certain
that I have the support of all hon members in welcoming them here and
saying to them that we hope that their visit to Parliament will have
sparked in them an abiding interest in politics. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, may I take this opportunity to congratulate
the hon Moloi on her maiden speech. She did very well. [Applause.]

The Bill seeks to bring the mineral and petroleum resources of South Africa
under the sovereign control of the Government so that the sector may be
controlled, planned and pursued with a vision of sustainable development
and equitable access maintained.

The MF notes that South Africa is a mineral-rich country. Noting the
previous squandering of state funds and resources, we hope that under the
watchful eye of our new Government, the potential and substance of these
resources will be guarded to the advancement and betterment of all society.
All South Africans own these resources and the state, appointed as legal
custodian, has to implement provisions to protect them.

The MF agrees with Government policy that the introduction of previously
disadvantaged persons into the minerals and mining industry is certainly
liberalising, and the problem of poverty and unemployment may be helped in
this manner. Sustainable development and economic growth are key factors
that our society is working towards. The mineral and mining industries
certainly have a lot of potential that may benefit this process in the long
run.

The MF appreciates the constitutional provisions that this Bill seeks to
uphold by ensuring that the nation's mining and petroleum resources are
developed in an orderly and ecologically sustainable manner. The MF
supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr D M DLALI: Chairperson, Minister of Minerals and Energy and other
Ministers, the Freedom Charter still unites, and South Africans accordingly
say, ``the people shall share in the country's wealth'', and ``the land
shall be shared amongst those who work it''.
It goes on to state, ``there shall be work and security'', and ``there
shall be houses, security and comfort''.  Our national Constitution also
guarantees the social and economic rights of all the people of South
Africa.

It is clear that there are those who do not want other people to have
comfort and share the same cake. We have to overcome the enormous racial,
gender and geographical disparities that continue to exist in the
distribution of wealth, economy and opportunities. These disparities are
themselves a fetter to the growth and expansion of the economy and wealth
in our society.

The discovery of diamonds in Kimberley, upon which the South African
economy was later established, paved the way for the colonist conveyance of
interest. Both Boer and Briton found reciprocal accommodations as their
interests coalesced. Their closed ranks confirmed the fact that the treaty
of Vereeniging of 1902 guaranteed them the undivided authority over the
land that they had usurped. Unity, while desirable for both the settler
communities, was deemed unsuited for the indigenous people. For the latter,
separate reserves and enclaves were prescribed and preordained.

Modern South Africa was in the making. The Union of South Africa Act in
1910 settled the marriage of Afrikaners and Britons. They excluded the
majority of black populations, impervious to the petitions, deputation and
nationwide outrage that accompanied their intentions.

The internationally accepted right of the state to exercise sovereignty
over all mineral resources within the state itself was internationally
accepted.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, will you please
allow the person who is speaking to be heard? If you do need to have a
conversation, then conduct it in an undertone, certainly not in the voluble
manner in which you are doing so at present.

I hope that this admonishment will stand and that you will co-operate with
the Chair. Carry on with your conversations, but please, Mr Grobler, I am
requesting you to do so in an undertone. Hon member, you may proceed.

Mr D M DLALI: We must also understand and accept that mineral resources are
the common heritage of all South African people, and the state is the
custodian thereof, for the benefit of all South Africans. South Africa is
therefore not breaking new ground or acting out of step with other
democratic and mature societies.

Strong mining countries such as Canada and Australia have provisions
similar to those before Parliament today. Many of the new developing
nations which are attracting massive amounts of foreign interest,
investments and capital in the mining sectors, such as Chile, Brazil,
Tanzania and Ghana, enshrine the principle of the state being the custodian
and public trustee of mineral rights.

For example, in terms of the National Water Act, there has been no
constitutional concern about the vesting of rights in the state. Why now?
Why mineral resources? This Bill before us today does address the access to
the nation's mineral resources being not only possible but also meaningful
and ensuring security of tenure in respect of prospecting and mining
operations.

It is clear, in this Bill, that existing mining companies have security of
tenure. The historically disadvantaged and marginalised communities will
now have potential access to the resources of South Africa. Mining and
rural communities will have environmental protection and development, and
the state will become the custodian and public trustee of the nation's
mineral resources.

The effect of the Bill is to create a state licensing system which will
bring our mining legislation into line with the rest of the world's and
will therefore eventually dispose of the common law system which has frozen
out the junior and small-scale operators in this country.

Security of tenure is not an issue at all. These lawyers, the Chamber of
Mines, De Beers, Anglo Plats and others are confusing the issue of
ownership. If a person has possession of something for five to 30 years,
that is still owning it. Nobody can claim ownership except that person as
an owner. Once the person has been granted a mining licence, it is that
person's and no one can take it away, unless he or she is not doing the
work. That is the ``use it or lose it'' principle. This is more than enough
in terms of security of tenure. After 30 years, it is also renewable. What
more does a person want?

The media, Business Day in particular, have made statements on this Bill
which have misled the public. I just wonder whether those very journalists
and researchers have ever read this Bill. Or is their mission to represent
the interests of the big white minority companies in this mining sector?

Business Day of 11 June asked, and I quote:``Is the new mining Bill Nepad-
unfriendly?'' This statement argues that this South African Bill appears to
run against international trends, but the writers of this very same article
know very well that they are wrong. They are misleading the public. I
appeal to them to stop misleading the public. They must first read the
Bill, and then tell South Africans the honest truth about what this Bill is
all about.
Firstly, the two researchers were saying:


  ... it does not allow for the automatic transfer  of  old  to  new  order
  rights, compromising security of tenure.

That is not correct. The Bill guarantees the right of conversion  from  old-
order right to a new right, and the Bill also says that  the  Minister  must
convert the old-order mining right into a new mining  right.  What  more  do
they want? The Minister, in this  section,  is  obliged  to  make  the  said
conversion. It is obligatory. Do hon members not understand that?

I understand that the transformation is painful to  those  who  enjoyed  the
riches of this country for so long.  Now  it  is  time  for  the  indigenous
people to enjoy the benefits of the fruits of their own  country.  The  time
is now for all South Africans to  share  the  fat  cake  called  the  mining
sector.

There are those who do not want to see the blacks, Africans in particular,
doing things for themselves, and want them to continue being treated as
cheap labour, servants of their masters. There are those who do not want to
see black Africans, in particular, having food on their plates, put there
with their own hands, without being employed and exploited by those big
businesses. They want blacks to continue in terms of the common-law
principle of master and servant for the rest of their lives and those of
their succeeding generations, while these big capitalists are enjoying,
with their succeeding generations, the riches of our country.

They also believe that blacks cannot do anything for themselves and just
want to be employed. Now is the time for Vukuzenzele, and the indigenous
people are more than ready to take the challenge thereof and run with it.
Not tomorrow. They have been waiting for this opportunity for decades, for
years, but they were denied the opportunity.

Now, the ANC Government is saying to the nation: ``Vukuzenzele, feed
yourselves, your kids and your generations! You have been waiting for too
long and struggled for this opportunity. The ball is in your court to run
with it. The ANC has made it possible for you, the indigenous people, to do
it, and it is your duty not to fail the ANC Government in its endeavours to
redress the imbalances of the past. Now is the time to claim back what is
yours, what was stolen from you, what belongs to you, what belongs to all
South Africans, to all those who live in this country and to those who
produce its wealth.''

I want to return to these two journalists. They must tell south Africa what
is correct and what is wrong in Business Day of 11 June. I quote further:


  It has been estimated that, in its latest form, the Bill could cost
  between 200 000 and 300 000 current and potential jobs in the South
  African mining industry, a sector which employed an average of 409 546
  people directly in 2000.

Who estimated these figures? Who collected them? What did this person want
to achieve? These claims are unfounded, untrue and wrong. I want them to go
out of this debate today and tell the readers of this paper and South
Africa what this Bill seeks to achieve and to address in a positive way,
not in the negative manner in which this has been done for the past few
weeks.
There is also an unfounded claim that the Bill in its current form does not
put South Africa on a competitive footing with other regions, and does not
exemplify the job growth environment that Nepad stands for. The question
will be: Which regions are these? What job growth environment are we
talking about? These are unfounded allegations.

This Bill, instead, is going to open up more opportunities, create more
jobs, secure more jobs or guarantee jobs, housing for workers and health
and safety for the miners and, more importantly, deal with these
subcontractors as part of the definition of employees, to protect these
workers who are employed as subcontractors and have no benefit and no
protection at all. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson and hon Minister, for the first time, I
can say with no reservation that you have made Azapo's politics simpler.
[Applause.] [Laughter.] Azapo has always maintained that the rampant market
forces have failed to ensure equitable redistribution of wealth and,
therefore, have disqualified themselves as saviours for the poor.
The Bill before us translates into Azapo's futuristic objectives in that it
effectively cuts the umbilical cord of the relationship between colonial
and apartheid mining and the new society which we are all building.
[Applause.]

The Bill, as Azapo understands it, transfers control of all mineral rights
from individuals and companies to the state, thereby transferring mineral
custody to the state. In this way, the Bill seeks to change ownership
patterns that, for decades, were concentrated into a few hands, especially
those of white males.

The 25% which is available to black economic empowerment groups, while
small, is nevertheless an important window of opportunity for disadvantaged
groups in our society. The fact that this Bill is linked to social
responsibility and the development of communities is something that Azapo
cannot fault.

The Bill, indeed, marks a turning point in our country. It marks the
beginning of a new relationship in the mining industry and, to Azapo, that
is transformation.

Azapo supports the Bill and salutes those who were responsible for drafting
it. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr B G BELL: Chairperson, Ministers, fellow members and guests, I rise to
speak on behalf of the DP, a member of the DA, in debating the Mineral and
Petroleum Resources Development Bill.

This piece of legislation has caught the imagination of the entire country.
As a committee, we received a large number of presentations from the public
and mining houses. It is a pity that, because it was decided to rush this
Bill through Parliament, no notice was taken of these opinions.

There are two distinct camps. One is for the Bill, and the other camp,
although supporting the general principles and objectives, with which we
agree, differs on a number of very important clauses.

The principle of the state owning all mineral rights is not uncommon in the
world scene, although not all countries subscribe to this. In South Africa,
over the last century, mineral rights became a marketable commodity and
could be severed from the surface rights. The result was that ownership was
spread over a large portion of the population. [Interjections.]

Rights belong to the communities, mining houses and individuals, mainly
farmers, and then the state owns 45% of these mineral rights. Why they
cannot hand that over immediately, I do not know.

In order for the state to be custodian over all mineral rights,
expropriation must take place. This expropriation is in dispute. The state
differs with the general public in the interpretation. A further
consequence is that, when the state grants a mining right to a potential
miner, the mining right allows the miner to enter a farm and virtually take
it over, so that he can mine the minerals. This amounts to expropriation of
the surface and compensation should be payable. The Bill disputes this, and
only when the farmer refuses to allow the miner to enter his land, thereby
committing a criminal offence, do the miner and the state have to enter
into negotiations with the farmer. I ask the Minister to note that this
aspect must be sorted out satisfactorily.
In an attempt to stop the mining companies from hoarding large areas, it
was found necessary to redefine ``mining area'' in the Bill. The definition
suggested was that the mining area would be confined to only the area in
the mining right. This definition is totally unworkable as it is possible,
for instance, that plant, villages, workshops, reduction works and office
blocks may be erected outside the mineralised area and would not
necessarily form part of the mining right. The consequences of this
scenario are huge. The final clause may save the situation.

Another section that presents problems is the section on beneficiation. The
desire to beneficiate all minerals mined is what all of us share. But this
dream is impractical, for a number of reasons. The lack of investment,
market shortage and our labour laws are but a few. The change to notifying
and consulting in this clause will soften it.

I trust that, in the administration of this very important legislation, the
development of the nation's vast mineral resources will be placed first and
not be clouded by the idealistic policies which have often come to the fore
in the discussions on this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr J H NASH: Mr Chairperson and hon Minister, I received a special
instruction from East London, from my dear wife, to leave the microphones
alone. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Please do so.

Mr T D LEE: And leave me alone too! [Laughter.]

Mr J H NASH: This is indeed an historic debate as this Bill represents the
transformation of an industry which controls the commanding heights of the
economy, functioning on the basis of monopolistic practices. The
transformation of the mining industry was the bedrock of our struggle for
emancipation. At last we are coming to grips with the issues that are going
to fulfil our aspirations as a people.

In the past few weeks we have benefited from public hearings in Cape Town,
the Northern province, the Northern Cape, the North West province and the
Free State. We listened to many of the best legal teams, or the prophets of
doom, utilising all sorts of scare tactics to frighten the living day-light
out of the committee. [Laughter.] The committee was taken on a guided tour
through international treaties and the pitfalls of nationalisation as well
as constitutionality. It was really time for the legal eagles to cash in.

I must say that if it had been the intention of the ANC to nationalise the
minerals and petroleum industry we would not have spent the time and the
money on a long-drawn-out parliamentary process. When will all South
Africans realise that this party takes democracy seriously? [Applause.] We
were subjected to threats by innuendo from the international community, who
would not invest in South Africa, and even the possibility that the passing
of the Bill would derail Nepad.

Nepad would commence on the organic initiative of the continent, as
investors only enter markets that already show stability and growth
potential. The mining, agricultural and energy sector would form the key to
African economic development, and therefore economic activities in this
sector could not remain in the hands of an unproductive monopoly. It was,
rather, free economic activity that would generate the necessary finance
for the development of the key sectors of the continent. Upon these sectors
would arise a manufacturing industry.

The veiled threat that, if the Bill is passed, it would negatively affect
Nepad was ever present. It seemed to me that the industry's support for
Nepad would depend on the protection of past monopolies. Does the industry
honestly believe that, when the objectives of the Bill are shown to
international friends, they would not agree to the internationally accepted
right to exercise sovereignty over mineral and petroleum resources and,
most of all, to expand opportunities for historically disadvantaged men and
women?

Knowing the history of this country, do we really think that the countries
that are keen to help in the Nepad process would turn their backs on South
Africa? No. The mining captains, the distinguished lawyers and the
Democratic Alliance or DP, whatever their title is, must note that those
countries would have shown us far more loyalty than they did in their
submissions to the committee, whose support for Nepad was dependent on the
Bill disappearing from the scene. Those are the conditions which the mining
houses put to us: ``You must support Nepad, so please get rid of this
Bill''. The ``pistol to the head'' approach. That is what they were using
against us.

I want to say today that long before this Bill came to Parliament, many
countries showed an interest in our mineral industry. In fact, they showed
far more interest and loyalty than the legal teams and the mine captains of
this country in their submissions at the hearings. We South Africans must
stop projecting a negative image of our country by bad-mouthing progressive
policies which encourage foreign investment. [Applause.] We must follow our
international friends who want to bolster the mining industry, thereby
transforming the industry from a sunset industry into a sunrise industry.

Furthermore, we should follow the lead of those countries which offered to
assist the small-scale miners with expertise and training, as empowerment
among local mining houses is nonexistent. Our local industry was premised
on complete protection. Monopoly ownership of mineral rights allowed ad
infinitum the vast areas to remain unexplored and undeveloped, preventing
free economic activity occurring, especially among the historically
disadvantaged.

It should be clearly understood that in a competitive environment there is
no shortage of investors. We need not be scared that the international
community will not invest, as the prophets of doom have mentioned here a
thousand times already and as they also mentioned in the hearings. In fact,
investors find creative ways of making money and are operating profitably
under different types of regulatory regimes. Those countries will come to
South Africa in spite of all these gloom-and-doom stories which we heard.

Our mining industry needs to free itself from the shackles of apartheid and
enter the international stage on the basis of currently prevailing
international economics. Mining activities in South Africa will have to be
benchmarked against current international practice to increase efficiency
while creating empowerment at the same time.

The Minister, for her part, went a long towards meeting the industries by
agreeing to a charter, which the Chamber and others requested. This clearly
shows that the Government is prepared to meet the industry and labour to
deal with concerns expressed. In fact, the industry kept on saying that
they agreed with the broad principle of the Bill, which stood in direct
contrast with the total onslaught which their legal teams presented. I must
protect my two chairmen against the onslaught by Mr Davidson.
[Interjections.] The honourable Mr Davidson, I should say. Just imagine,
simply because he could not get his way in the committee, suddenly the
committee is biased. The committee gave everyone their fair share.

I must also mention, in front of the royal Bofokeng representatives here,
that one thing which I was very impressed by was the fact that the Bafokeng
came to Cape Town and said to us: ``We do not want the minerals for
ourselves only.'' Everyone who spoke said that they wanted to share the
minerals with everyone else in South Africa. [Applause.] What did the
mining houses and our good friends in the DA decide? They decided that they
wanted to keep the monopoly as long as they live, to keep them ``whites
only'', to keep them for themselves. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members I would like to
encourage all the wives of all hon members to instruct their husbands to co-
operate fully with the Chair, as does Mrs Nash. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson, hon members, comrades in
the gallery, it has been a good day. [Applause.] Judging by this debate,
there are no issues. Really, there are no issues. Davidson is scratching
for stories_

Kufuneka amoshe. Uze apha ukuza kumosha, qha. Ndithi kumaqabane lo mcimbi
ugqityiwe, ucalanye. [Uwele-wele.] [He has to spoil. He is here only to
spoil. I am saying to the comrades that this matter has been fully
addressed. [Interjections.]]

This is a good Bill. I would like to congratulate the committee, including
Davidson - Shame! [Laughter.] Of course I congratulate my two co-chairs and
the study group of the ANC, who literally worked day and night.
Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, on a point of order: Could the Minister please
refer to Mr Davidson as ``the hon Mr Davidson''. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, you are perfectly correct. All
members here are hon members.

The MINISTER: OK, the hon Davidson. We are on first-name terms. I would
also like to assure the members of the New NP and the IFP that we take
their advice on issues of constitutionality very seriously. I will advise
the President to consider the importance of ensuring that we can test this
before it is signed. I will give that advice. [Applause.]

I also want to assure members that the ANC members in the NCOP will propose
an amendment which will further tighten, not just in the transitional
period, but also beyond this period, the issues of compensation so as to
ensure that the issue of property rights is not compromised in any way.
This is just to demonstrate that we are very serious about ensuring that
this Bill is constitutional. [Applause.]

A lot of people have made allegations here about what investors will do  and
not do.

Uyazi, abanye abakaze bayibone ne investment ukuthi yinto enjani! [You
know, some people have never even seen what investment looks like.]

They are making allegations here about hearsay. I talk to investors.
Minister Erwin, Minister Manuel, the other Ministers and I govern this
country. We are taken seriously, not those members. We know what they have
to say about this economy, this Bill and what their intentions are in this
economy. It is because of what we have learned from them that we have been
strengthened to move forward. We are not worried about what these members
are saying in relation to investment, because as far we are concerned.

Mr W J SEREMANE: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER: Shut up, wena Seremane! [Laughter.]

Today, because we are fighting for black people, and I am sure the hon
Seremane has forgotten who he is, he is fighting the loudest.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Gibson, are you rising on
a point of order?

Mr D H M GIBSON: Yes, I am, Chairperson, the hon the Minister is also
forgetting who and where she is. Will she please refer to the hon Mr
Seremane in respectful terms and not tell him, ``Shut up, Seremane!''
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER: Okay, Shut up, honourable Seremane! [Interjections.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Chairperson, on a point of order: Surely telling a member,
honourable or otherwise, to shut up is unparliamentary? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I think you know
from long experience that in the cut and thrust of politics, one can be
very robust. Therefore I would like state that this is part of a robust
debate and it is parliamentary. [Applause.]

The MINISTER: Chairperson, I would also like to assure members that the
money Bill is on the way. The Minister of Finance and the director-general
have assured me that the Bill will be coming to Parliament within the time
that we agreed with them. So as far as this is concerned there is no
problem.

I want to advise members who also tried to speak on behalf of the industry
in South Africa that the industry does not appreciate this. They do not
appreciate this because those members continue to misrepresent their case.
The industry speaks to us, and that is why we have an understanding which
these members do not understand. They should not speak on behalf of di
kgosi, in particular the Bafokeng, because they are here to speak for
themselves. The DP should stop pretending that they have a constituency
that they do not have. [Applause.]

I would also like to inform the hon Groenewald that I am shocked at his
patronising attitude towards black people. He tells us that this has been
too quick. Is 300 years of oppression not long enough for him? I could not
believe that he could stand here and tell us that we are rushing this Bill.
For those people who have waited it could not have happened too soon. This
is our country, just as it is his, and our people want to enjoy the same
things that his people enjoyed for many years when they excluded everybody
else.

Tonight maqabane slya e St Francis kwa-Langa maksisuka lapha. [Tonight,
comrades, from here we are going to St Francis in Langa township.] Viva to
Azapo. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

Division demanded.

                        TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Chairperson, hon members, I hope that we are also going to
have a song after this Bill has been passed. I rise here on behalf of the
ANC to support the Bill before us. When the Minister of Finance delivered
his Budget Speech in this House in February this year, he handed out
grapes. Let us now see whether these grapes will taste sweet or sour for
us.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, those who are
leaving the Chamber should do so quietly and quickly so that we can
continue with the proceedings.

Mrs R R JOEMAT: I will cover only certain aspects of this Bill that affect
individual taxpayers. Other speakers will cover other aspects in this Bill.
Let us unpack what the Minister said in his Budget Speech and see what
impact it will have on taxes for individuals. Thereafter, I hope we will
understand and appreciate that all will have to contribute and sacrifice
certain perks that were previously enjoyed and tax-deductible.

The scrapping of certain tax perks and deductions for certain individuals
and businesses will net approximately R100 million for the Receiver of
Revenue. Besides accruing from revenues gained, savings will also come from
better utilisation of staff. Assessors will now use less time in having to
assess, scrutinise and check up on deduction claims.

Looking at tax structures in other countries, one will find that most
countries have limited deductions in favour of a scheduled approach. Our
Government is moving towards a more definitive split between business and
employment income. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Carry on, hon member.

Mrs R R JOEMAT: They are also doing away with the general type of deduction
for employees. This will simplify the tax system.

Let me give the good news first. The deductions that will still be allowed
are pension, medical-aid and retirement fund contributions. The threshold
of R1 000 for medical expenses has been removed. Taxpayers aged 65 and
below will now be able to claim the amount of medical expenses which
exceeds 5% of their taxable income. Exemption on interest has increased.
Taxpayers under the age of 65 years can now claim an amount of R6 000,
whereas previously it was R4 000. The increase for taxpayers who are over
the age of 65 years is from R5 000 to R10 000. The primary rebate has been
increased from R4 140 to R4 860. [Interjections.]

Chairperson, could we ask the Leader of the Opposition to shut up!
[Laughter.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon Leader of the
Opposition, order! Hon members, I have asked you to behave. I can name you,
but I have asked you please to conduct whatever conversation you are
conducting in an undertone so that it does not disturb the general order of
the House. That is the rule and it is a rule to which all of us are bound.
And I would like all of the hon members here to adhere to that rule, both
in spirit and to the letter.

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Thank you, Chairperson. Donations to certain approved
public benefit organisations will be allowed, but official receipts issued
by the public benefit organisation must be produced.

Now for the news that is not so good, but is fair. Travel deductions will
continue, but only if expenses can be proved by receipts. The following
deductions will also affect MPs. For periods when an individual is away
from home on business or work-related travels, claims for accommodation
have been removed and the allowance for meals has been limited to R65 per
day.

Entertainment and deemed subsistence allowances for individuals will be
abolished if they do not affect the actual income of the employee. With
these adjustments in this Bill, employees' income will clearly be defined.

Any payment received in respect of employment is included in an employee's
gross income in terms of the definition of ``gross income''.

However, certain benefits flowing from employment are not paid in cash, and
these benefits in kind need to be determined. One may ask what kinds of
benefits these are. For example, an employee might enjoy a motor vehicle or
accommodation owned by the company, and in some instances enjoys both of
these benefits. These benefits need to be calculated by way of formulae.

This Bill provides specific provisions for the calculation of the value
that must be placed upon each benefit that accrues to an employee. The
commissioner will use market value for some types of fringe benefit and
cost price for others.

Other allowances are generally paid to employees to meet expenditure
incurred on behalf of an employer. The portion of those allowances which is
not expended must be included in the employee's taxable income. The most
common types of allowance are travelling, subsistence, uniform, cellphone
and entertainment allowances.

These adjustments will bring some fairness to our income tax laws and close
some loopholes. There are very creative remuneration structures and this is
unfair to the majority of workers that only work for a straight salary
package. We see juristic persons become companies with the aim of dodging
tax, and then they can claim a wide range of benefits. This becomes a
disadvantage to those who do not enjoy such benefits.

Tax evasion is a problem for our country. This is seen in the example the
Donald King case, which is currently before Sars, of alleged tax evasion
amounting to R900 million. The urgency of fairness in our income tax system
must be recognised.

The concern was raised of the increasing tendency to grant wide
discretionary powers to the commissioner. Whilst the intention behind this
amendment is supported, the committee believes that appropriate checks and
balances must be suitably managed, be transparent and free from subjective
judgment and be accountable. The commissioner and his team of qualified tax
assessors will carry out these functions.

A formal process for appealing against any penalties or any other charges
has been established. This enhances the facilitation of transparency and
ensures higher levels of compliance. The commissioner may also settle a
dispute, but must comply with the provisions prescribed by the Minister of
Finance.

I want to refer to two types of relationship in nature and in humans. In
the first kind, one party benefits and prospers and grows. The other party
suffers and is harmed.

Mense van diÃ© aard kan vergelyk word met bosluise. [People like these can
be compared to ticks.]

These are the tax dodgers - the parasites who benefit while others have to
pay taxes. The second type of relationship is one in which both parties
derive benefits from the relationship. They both grow and prosper like the
bee and the flower - the bee gets the nectar and makes honey, while the
flower gets the pollination and bears the fruits. This is the type of
mutual relationship towards which we must strive.

But what is more important is to achieve the benefit that is economic
growth by increasing competitiveness, raising employment levels and
reducing poverty. That is why taxes must be fair and must be paid, so that
all can benefit, especially the poor. The majority party supports this
Bill. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, hon members, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill
is a mixed bag of taxation proposals flowing from both budgets. It also
includes important provisions in terms of tax administration and the
administrative powers of the Commissioner of the SA Revenue Service.

The good news in terms of this Bill is that it gives legal content to the
welcome tax relief announced in February. The burden of personal tax has
been reduced through rates and bracket adjustments, with a R15 billion cut
mainly benefiting low- and middle-income earners, while the top marginal
rate has also been cut from 42% to 40%.

This matter must receive more attention in an era of global skills
mobility, where the top marginal rate is still considered a disincentive to
retaining and attracting skills.

On average, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, taxes for those
earning under R150 000 per year are reduced by 25%, while the tax threshold
for pensioners under 65 has been raised to R27 000. But, while we are
formalising the welcome tax relief today, we need to take cognisance of the
impact of relatively high inflation and the vagaries of fiscal drag.
Economists, according to the Economist Intelligent Unit, calculate that
after adjustment for this inflation effect, roughly only half the tax
concessions are realised, especially for earners in the lower- and middle-
income brackets. This, unfortunately, is the bad news.

The extension of tax relief to SMMEs through redefining SMMEs as those with
a turnover of up to R3 million is welcome, but a tax compliance burden
audit for small business, looking at all levies and taxes, is overdue.
Perhaps Sars, the National Treasury and the Department of Trade and
Industry can conduct such an audit as an urgent priority.

The DA welcomes the proposals that seek to formalise and categorise the tax-
exempt status of public benefit organisations and the Ninth Schedule in the
Bill, but urges Sars and the National Treasury to continue engaging with
civil society in terms of their concerns in relation to the policy
decisions behind parts I and II of the schedule, as well as the possible
retrospective effect of letting the Minister of Finance list in accordance
with the Ninth Schedule.

While this Bill creates an employment incentive and skews that incentive to
target it at the unemployed, the benefit of the incentive must not falter
due to administrative inefficiencies within the Setas, as the learnership
registration process will be the key to unlocking the benefit. The
efficiency of the Ministry of Labour and the Setas in this regard will be
critical, and Parliament will be keeping a watchful eye.

The DA believes, however, that only higher levels of job creation and job-
creating economic growth can dent South Africa's unemployment crisis on a
meaningful scale and that the incentive is merely a small social security
net in the context of low levels of jobless economic growth. In a context
where the Minister of Finance does a jig on the Mineral and Petroleum
Resources Development Bill, with the consequences for foreign direct
investment and job creation, we will have to see what measures an
employment incentive can effect, and the impact it can make, when such
action is conducted in this House by the Minister.

The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill tackles a soft target by doing away with
tax-deductible allowances under the guise of claims of administrative
efficiency. While the Sars aim to create a simple list of deductible
allowances to increase efficiency, the DA believes that efficiency will be
hampered by the new onerous burden of receipt verification inherent in the
new proposed changes.
During deliberations the committee expressed concern about the increase of
the administrative powers of the Commissioner of Sars. The Bill furthermore
seeks to establish a new dispute resolution and arbitration-type
arrangement for Sars to the exclusion of other appeal mechanisms. While
they could increase administrative efficiency through these provisions,
these powers will be controversial until such time as a specified and
codified taxpayers' charter is adopted to give concrete substance to the
obligations that befall Sars under the Promotion of Administrative Justice
Act.

Revenue collection has exceeded projected revenue for the past few years,
primarily due to marked efficiency gains by Sars. This factor has more than
compensated for other areas where projections were not met, such as
privatisation and the GDP growth rate, thereby enabling the National
Treasury to stick to its fiscal balance targets. However, these efficiency
gains and the focus on the soft target of the formal sector's gap or
noncompliance, correct as this is in terms of tax morality, cannot be
expected to effect and offset shortfalls elsewhere in the budget ad
infinitum.

In this regard, the National Treasury and Sars will have a number of tax
policy questions to confront. Critical for future revenue growth and the
integrity of the tax system will be the performance of Sars in terms of the
tax policy objective of broadening the tax base. The tax base will, of
course, broaden as a result of the new residence-based tax system and
capital gains tax, whatever the merits and demerits of these taxes may be.

While corporate tax evasion has been addressed by Sars, in terms of the tax
gap project, the key challenge remains that of taking the growing informal
sector formally into the tax net.

In their submission to the Portfolio Committee on Finance on the Taxation
Laws Amendment Bill, Sacob made the following observation:


  The impact of these major tax reforms has yet to be tested. As a broad
  observation on the taxation measures introduced, Sacob believes that
  there has been a marked emphasis on the redistributive powers of
  taxation. Insufficient attention has been given to the potential effect -
  adverse or otherwise - those measures have had on economic growth.

Sacob's observation highlights one of the key challenges for this
Parliament: growing oversight and scrutiny powers over the impact of the
policy and legislative measure we take. In the realm of tax, the need for
this oversight is particularly pronounced. Having made these broader policy
comments, the DA supports this Bill.

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Chairman, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill of 2002
results from the Budget, or the Estimates of Revenue. The IFP has accepted
and applauded the Minister's Budget Speech, and therefore we also accept
the underlying clauses and we will vote for the Bill.

Die onderhawige wetgewing is gevolglike wetgewing. In die verlede is goedig
daarna verwys as die sogenaamde rommelkaswetgewing. Dit beteken dat
uitvoering gegee word aan die begrotingsvoorstelle van die Minister van
Finansies. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The legislation is consequential legislation. In the past it was good
naturedly referred to as the so-called omnibus legislation. It means that
the Budget proposals of the Minister of Finance are being implemented.]

In terms of this legislation, several limitations on employee deductions
are introduced.

As it is applicable to other taxpayers, of course it will also apply to
members of this Parliament. This is particularly applicable with regard to
travelling, accommodation, meals and incidentals. The deemed R150-per-day
deductible item is being withdrawn. Where the employer pays for
accommodation, the deemed expense is now reduced to R65 per day. The R2Â 500
per year for hospitality of a casual nature is also being withdrawn.

Transfer duty is being rationalised in the sense that property below
R100Â 000 will not attract any duties. Five percent will be payable on
property values between R100Â 000 and R300Â 000; and above R300Â 000, the duty
is now 8%.

Remuneration of directors will also be subject to PAYE and Unemployment
Insurance Fund contributions as well as the skills levy. On several items,
stamp duties are being scrapped.

The good news is with regard to the basis of small business development. A
small business corporation, in terms of its definition, includes any close
corporation or company registered as a private company in terms of the
Companies Act and it must comply with certain criteria. These criteria
include the requirement that the gross income for the year of assessment,
in terms of the present Bill before us, not exceed R3 million; that none of
the shareholders or members hold any shares or interest in any other
unlisted company; that not more than 20% of the gross income consist of
investment income and income for rendering a personal service as defined;
and that the company not be an employment company.

Small business corporations are subject to a graduated tax rate of 15% on
the first R150Â 000 of taxable income and may write off investment
expenditure in the year in which it has occurred.

Small business development is a key element of the Government's strategy
for economic growth and job creation. The proposals contained in the Budget
Review this year build on the tax concession granted in the 2000-01 Budget.

With regard to customs and excise duties, several positive amendments are
being made and greater control is being exerted in terms of that.

The IFP will support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr F C FANKOMO: Chairperson and hon members, I am pleased to take the stage
and debate on the huge improvements contained in the Tax Laws Amendment
Bill of 2002. These improvements came about through a constructive
interaction between Sars, the Department of Finance, the Portfolio
Committee on Finance, the private sector and the nonprofit sector.

Since the coming to operation of the new Constitution, the ANC-led
Government has been committed to transparency and people's participation in
the rebuilding of the newly formed democracy by bringing more people to
contribute to legislation. Thus, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill
introduces amendments to, among other laws, the Transfer Duty Act of 1949,
the Estate Duty Act of 1955 and the Skills Development Levies Act of 1999,
which my speech will focus on.

Transfer duty was levied on the acquisition of fixed property in South
Africa. Therefore the rate for the property acquired by natural persons was
1% on the value up to R70Â 000, 5% on the value from R70Â 000 to R250Â 000 and
8% on the value above R250Â 000. However, to further encourage the
acquisition of property and to ensure a more equitable distribution of the
transfer duty burden, these rates had to be amended. Therefore, no duty
will be payable on the first R100Â 000 of the value of a property, 5% will
be paid on the value of a property from R100Â 000 to R300Â 000 and 8% on the
value of property above R300Â 000. This new rate structure was applied in
respect of property acquired, or rights or interest in property renounced,
in terms of the agreement entered into from 1 March 2002.

The Minister of Finance proposed that those institutions or boards
established by or under any law which are exempted from from income tax
under section 10(1)(cN) of the Income Tax Act of 1962, and which previously
qualified for transfer duty exemption as they were regarded as religious,
charitable and educational institutions, no longer qualify for transfer
during exemption according to section 30 of the recommendation of the
commissioner. Thus the Minister proposed that the institutions, boards and
bodies established by law, which carry on public benefit activities as
contemplated in section 30, be exempted.

The acquisition of certain properties by the natural person is exempted
from transfer duty to provide relief to low-income groups. This includes
the acquisition of a dwelling house or residential apartment held under
sectional title with a value of R70Â 000 or less and the acquisition of
unimproved land to erect dwelling houses with a value of R300Â 000 or less.

The Estate Duty Act of 1955 provides for the reduction from the total value
of all property included in the estate of the value of any property which
accrues to a public benefit organisation which is exempted in terms of the
Income Tax Act of 1962. Thus, the introduction of the new provisions in the
Income Tax Act of 1962 which regulate the tax exemption of public benefit
organisations necessitated the amendment of section 4(h)(i) of the Estate
Duty Act, as these institutions, boards and bodies were no longer exempted
from income tax under section 10(1)(cN) of the Income Tax Act of 1962.
Therefore the introduction of section 4(h)(iA) of the Estate Duty Act of
1955 was to ensure specific inclusion under the exemption of property which
accrues to any institution, board or body created by law.

With regard to the Skills Development Levies Act of 1999, the amount of the
skills development levy paid by an employer was based on the amount of the
remuneration paid or payable or deemed to be paid or payable by that
employer to its employees during the month. Thus, in the past, the
remuneration paid by a private company to its director was excluded from
the employees' tax provision. However, this was amended in the fourth
schedule to the Income Tax Act of 1962 to include directors in the
employment tax system by the introduction of paragraph 11C, which deems
certain amounts to be paid by the private company to a director of the
company. All these changes took effect on March 2002.
According to the Skills Development Levies Act of 1999, the deemed amount
of remuneration is also included for the reasons of determining the
liability of any employer for the skills development levy. Therefore,
inclusively, the deemed and actual remuneration would be taken into account
in the determination of the employer's liability for skills development.
However, for the purposes of the Skills Development Levies Act, the deemed
remuneration has not been taken into account in these amendments.

The exemptions relating to the religious and charity institutions were
amended to bring them into line with the public benefit organisation
provision in the Income Tax Act of 1962. We therefore, as the ANC, support
these amendments of the taxation laws. [Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Mr Chairman, hon Minister and hon members, the Taxation Laws
Amendment Bill is a lengthy and highly technical Bill and introduces
amendments to a number of Acts which range from the Insurance Act of 1943
to the Unemployment Insurance Contributions Act of 2002.

The proposed amendment to section 8(1) of the Income Tax Act of 1962
clarifies employee deductions. It also clarifies taxation where an
employee's remuneration is derived in the form of commission based on sales
turnover. Another aspect of section 8(1)(a)(i) is the definition of
``principal'' as an employer or the holder of an office. Paragraph (c)
refers to incidental costs incurred by employees and the amounts deemed to
have been expended.

The amendment of section 2 of the Transfer Duty Act of 1949 will encourage
the acquisition of property and will lead to a more equitable distribution
of transfer duties. Allow me briefly to accentuate the following. No duty
will be payable on the first R100Â 000 of the value of the property, 5% will
be payable from R100Â 000 to R300Â 000 and 8% will be payable on the value of
a property above R300Â 000. It is my opinion that the proposed new rate
structure will enable previously disavantaged members of our society to
acquire fixed property, a key prerequisite to alleviating poverty.

The amendment of section 4A of the Estate Duty Act of 1955 will increase
the basic deductions of R1 million to R1,5 million in respect of a deceased
estate. This is a significant deduction. We appeal for the review of the
entire Estate Duty Act of 1955.

Belasting op aftreefondse moet ook spoedig hersien word, omdat duisende
belastingpligtiges se staat van bates en laste radikaal verander vanweÃ«
omstandighede soos inflasie en die versterking of verswakking van die rand
teenoor ander geldeenhede.

'n Belastingstelsel moet ook 'n kultuur van ondernemerskap en innovering
bevorder, en ek is baie bly om te sÃª dat, volgens die finansiÃ«le
tydskrifte, ons huidige belastingstelsel nie die gees van ondernemerskap en
entrepreneurskap verwater het nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[The taxation of retirement funds should also be reviewed before long,
because the schedule of assets and liabilities of thousands of taxpayers is
changing rapidly due to circumstances such as inflation and the rise and
fall of the rand against other monetary units.

Any system of taxation should also promote a culture of entrepreneurship
and innovation and I am very happy to say that, according to financial
magazines, our present system of taxation has not weakened our spirit of
free enterprise and entrepreneurship.]

Section 12E of the Income Tax Act of 1962 provides for the deduction of
certain plant and machinery operations. Again, I think this will spur
growth in our manufacturing sector, especially smaller businesses and so
forth.

The significance of section 18A in particular is that a group of public
benefit organisations sharing a common purpose may register as a co-
ordinating body and apply for tax exemption.

Clause 22(k) of the Bill provides for a five-year period to allow PBOs to
reorganise their affairs to avoid jeopardising their tax-exempt status.

I know that my time is running out. This is a very important piece of
legislation. The New NP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Chairperson and hon members, clauses in this Bill give
practical effect to announcements of the 2002 Budget, and I will not refer
to the individual proposals in detail, as they have been widely publicised
and debated.

The major feature of the Bill is increased discretions given to the
Commissioner for the SA Revenue Service. He receives powerful mechanisms to
settle tax disputes out of court. It is reported that both the Margo and
Katz commissions have indicated that such a trend should be avoided at all,
if possible.

We therefore appeal to the Minister to ensure that the granting of such
wide discretion to the commissioner should be accompanied by proper and
transparent reporting.

A second concern regarding the Bill relates to section 18(A) status, that
is the deduction of donations to certain public benefit organisations. At
present the upgrading and renovating of schools and clinics, especially in
the remote areas of the country, do not qualify for section 18(A) status or
benefits. Sars has undertaken to take this matter back to the Minister,
instead of awaiting the next cycle of the process. The Minister may want to
inform this House of his response.

It is estimated that the Revenue Service will save in the excess of R100
million through limiting deductions and restructuring allowances, apart
from revenue gains through the scrapping of tax deductions. We are
grateful, however, that a number of important deductions will remain in
place, including those for pension, medical aid and on retirement fund
contributions. What is not included in the Bill is taxation on the banking
industry, on the mining industry and on the retirement industry. We appeal
to the Minister to be very sensitive regarding such taxes in future. We
trust that the process will be consultative and that he will consult widely
with all stakeholders on a transparent basis, if he decides to initiate any
such taxes.

In conclusion, this Bill will put additional strain and pressure on Sars to
perform. We hope and we trust that Sars has embarked on comprehensive and
applicable training programmes for their employees in order to meet the
increase demands of performance prescribed in this Bill. The UDM supports
the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon Minister, members, owing to the limited time
given to me, I just want to comment only on the tax-exempt status of NGOs.

The ACDP is happy to see that the tax-exempt status of NGOs has been
clarified. The list for qualification has significantly expanded, providing
great relief for many involved in this service. Tax benefits have always
been an important factor serving nonprofit organisations and we wish to
commend the Minister for expanding tax relief for NGOs. It is encouraging
to see that many NGOs are applying for tax exemption. The requirement that
organisations must register for income tax or tax-exempt purposes will help
the sector to achieve greater coherency in how its donations can enjoy the
maximum benefit. The burden of inconsistent fund applications or
misappropriation of donations may be controlled, especially as public
benefit organisations will be required to ensure that decision-making
powers are not vested only in one single individual.

Another area where organisations may derive benefits through section 30 of
the Income Tax Act is the proposal that, in terms of the dissolution of an
organisation, the assets may be transferred to ``any institution, board or
body which is exemp from tax'' and which carries on ``any public benefit
activity''.

The advantage of this proposal will help organisations identify other
similar members who may benefit from the assets in the event of
dissolution.

The whole idea of nonprofit organisations is to ensure that the public
benefit through their services. Office bearers of such an organisation or
any other person ought not to expect benefits beyond the reasonable objects
of the organisation.

It is with these few comments in mind, that the ACDP supports this
legislation.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill appears to
amend a number of Bills. This may be for our convenience, so that we are
not bogged down with many individual amendments, but it makes it hard to
cover everything at once.

Nevertheless, the MF has no objections to the provisions suggested. The
amendment made regarding exemptions from income tax is welcomed and
understood in the light of the fact that the categories exempted should
benefit the community. It will, however, be felt that such an exemption is
richly deserved by the public at large, who suffer and struggle to put food
in the mouths of their children and for whom the paying of income tax is
virtually impossible.

The MF does not object to the payment of tax, as it is due, but the
devastation of tax on small salaries that have to cover large families is
burdensome. Taking 18% from a modest salary may appear reasonable, but with
today's cost of living and the needs that have to be met, apart from
luxuries, these taxes are burdensome and often rob taxpayers of the rewards
of long hours of hard work.

Further provisions set by the hon the Minister concerning estate duties are
agreed to without objections.

The MF unfortunately is limited in addressing this Bill to the best of our
ability by time constraints, but voices no objection to the amendments
made. We find them relevant and support the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms B A HOGAN: Mr Chairperson, this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill is
significant for a number of reasons; not the least is the learnership
incentives.

Some time ago it was announced that in order to encourage employment and
job creation, certain tax incentives would be put in place. The National
Treasury and Sars, in consultation with other departments, have brought in
a very interesting way of introducing this wage incentive, and that is
through the learnership incentive.

Basically it means that should a person employed by a company enter into a
learnership agreement, the total annual remuneration of that employee, to a
maximum of R25 000, could be deducted for tax purposes and once again on
completion. That would be 70%. For a person who was previously unemployed
it would be the total remuneration on the signing of the learnership
agreement and on completion thereof.

This is a very well-crafted incentive for job creation and for skilling our
population. As Ms Taljaard has said, it is critically dependent on how well
our Setas are operating. Our Minister of Labour is here, and he has assured
us that they are looking very closely at the operation of the Setas. I wish
business well when they look at these issues, because certainly it will
assist us in going forward with tax incentives.

Besides the numerous forms of tax relief that are given, the other most
significant part of this legislation deals with the relief given to public
benefit organisations. This dispensation, which was first introduced in the
Taxation Laws Amendment Bill of 2000, completes the cycle on the benefit
given to public benefit organisations. For the first time in this country's
history significant tax relief is given to public benefit organisations,
and civil society will, no doubt, benefit greatly from this.

However, there are one or two matters that I would like to raise. I know
that we are at the start and have to go carefully, but we do know that the
most significant tax relief that is given to NGOs is the donations tax, a
tax relief given to those people who donate to public benefit
organisations. This is an important tax relief because it encourages those
who have, particularly corporations, to make donations to worthy causes.
The fiscus loses but civil society gains through gaining alternative means
of income.

The Treasury and Sars have been very precise in formulating which
activities would receive this kind of tax relief. It falls under welfare
and humanitarian activities. Basically, tax relief can be granted if one
donates to organisations involved in the care or counselling of or the
provision of education programmes relating to abandoned, abused, neglected,
orphaned or homeless children and the care or counselling of poor and needy
persons, where more than 90% of those persons are over the age of 60. There
is also provision of health care to poor and needy persons, the care or
counselling of terminally ill persons, the prevention of HIV infection, the
care, counselling and treatment of persons afflicted with HIV/Aids and a
whole range of concessions given for people involved in educare, training
for the unemployed and the establishment of transfrontiers.

What we have here is donations relief which is very focused on the absolute
poor and, we would almost say, the indigent people of our society. That is
right. Over time I hope that we do come to review these very narrow
restrictions, because I do believe that a flourishing social society is to
the benefit of us all. I am not merely talking about the alleviation of
poverty. I am also talking about organisations involved in cultural
activities that enrich our societies and do not only deal with poverty
relief. We are talking about a wide range of institutions which would
benefit from donations from the corporate sector. If we are able to get
these donations to move towards these other activities as well, I think it
would be to the greater benefit of civil society.

The ANC has no difficulty in supporting this Bill. One of the issues that
have been raised, though, is the issue of the regulation of tax advisers.
The Minister has announced that that issue is going to be looked into in
more detail. We all know there is a whole motley crew of people who provide
tax advice, so certainly better regulation would be welcomed, as people do
suffer from the lack of regulation.

Also, a lot of discussion in our committee was about whether the
commissioner was receiving undue powers. I certainly have not made up my
mind about this issue, but I do believe it might be useful for the
commissioner, at some stage, to come before the committee to outline what
new powers have been given him. Certainly, when I look at the powers given
to him in terms of internal review procedures in the present Act, they do
not strike me as undue powers. They fall within the terrain of the
promotion of administrative justice and the requirements of that
legislation. Nevertheless, I do think it is an issue that we need to come
back to from time and time. When the committee has an opportunity we would
like to engage with the commissioner on these issues.

The ANC supports this Bill. We want to congratulate Sars and the National
Treasury, once again, on the extraordinary care and attention they take in
addressing every issue that is raised by every person who appears before
our committee. I say this every time. There is seldom a department that
produces a comprehensive response to every issue raised by every person who
makes a submission to our committee. It is an example of democracy in
action and want to congratulate them on the ongoing way in which they
respect democratic institutions in this country. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I would like to express sincere
support to all the parties, because all the parties support the amending
Bill before us. I would also like to share with colleagues here some good
news about taxation and tax administration. On this past Sunday evening we
launched the Southern African Tax Institute, where the first courses are
being run for tax administrations from different African countries. There
are some 60 participants from 16 countries who are undergoing training,
alongside our South African representatives - that is, employees of Sars
and the National Treasury. That is very good, because we then will develop
a cadre of people on the continent who approach matters similarly.

Having said that, let me try to respond to some of the issues that have
been raised by members. Hon Rabie raised the matter of the retirement funds
and I would like to advise that that is a work in progress. We gave an
undertaking that we would review the process and would come back here.

A number of members raised the amendments in section 18(A) and the
relationship with public benefit organisations, and I would like to advise
members that that also is work in progress. We have a meeting with the
Nonprofit Partnership scheduled, so that we can deal with the issues that
they are encountering as the voice of advocacy for public benefit
organisations.

In respect of the issues raised by the hon Koornhof on the taxation of the
banking sector and the mining sector, the first point to make is that,
clearly, we have to be mindful of the contributions to the economy of these
sectors. However, having said that, it is also imperative that we enjoy the
support of members of this House to ensure that taxes are paid in terms of
the laws passed by this House.

The discussions in respect of the banking sector, which we have reported on
in this House previously, are essentially about going out there to collect
taxes which have been due, and, clearly, there are going to be issues we
have to deal with in a lot more detail, going forward. Amongst those would
be that complex area of taxation, namely the taxation of financial
derivative instruments. We are not alone in respect of the challenge here.
There are very few countries that are dealing with these issues now, partly
because there are no accounting standards for financial derivatives.

These will be big issues, so our engagement with the financial services
industry in the future would require of us to ensure that we can place
issues on an equal footing. In saying that, clearly, the approach to the
retirement funds industry, as opposed to the funds themselves, needs to
also be informed by the range of instruments that an industry like the
retirement fund industry would use, often for tax minimisation and
sometimes in that grey area between avoidance and evasion.

The hon Rajbally raised a point on which I am sure all in this House agree
with her, namely the importance of trying to secure the earnings of low-
income earners. It is for that reason that we have raised the tax
threshold, so that people under the age of 65 earning below R27 000 do not
have to pay tax, and people over the age of 65 who earn under R42 650 do
not have to pay tax. The threshold is something we have moved up. It was
R16 500 when I first became Minister of Finance, and it is something that
we remain very mindful of, to try and secure the earnings of low-income
earners.

The hon Hogan raised the issue of the regulation of tax advisers. Clearly,
it is something that we remain in discussion about with the SA Institute of
Chartered Accountants and the Public Accountants' and Auditors' Board,
because they understand as well that these kinds of issues bring the
profession into disrepute.

What we have said to them is that people take the best advice and, in fact,
pay for professional advice, and if the advise is less than honest and less
than rigorous, the taxpayer is then left with a huge tax burden later, and
the adviser merely walks on. So the issue of regulation is important to
protect the interests of taxpayers in their engagement with the Revenue
Service but also in the interest of securing the good name of the
profession.

The hon Taljaard raised a few issues. Let me just try and deal with three
of them briefly. The first point is that I would like to suggest that she
is patently incorrect in arguing that growth and redistribution are
contradictory. They are not. By advancing issues of redistribution, we are
growing the access of people to finance, we are growing the markets and we
are growing the economy. It is important that we recognise that these are
mutually supportive.

I do not suppose that we will ever agree on that, because our perspectives
on this would be very different. However, societies that are more equal are
societies that tend to grow better. In respect of a quote which I think I
have now heard for the third time this week as an authoritative statement
from the Economist Intelligence Unit, let us not fetishise them. They are
economists and, like anybody else, they change their minds. Let us not
construct an altar before the Economist Intelligence Unit.

In respect on the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill, I think
the hon member is, again, patently wrong in saying that the Bill will, in
any way, damage foreign direct investment. In the past few months, we have
engaged with mining companies, both South African and foreign, and many of
the foreign companies are, in fact, enthused by the fact that for the first
time, some of them will have access to rights that were locked up by South
African companies that may have acquired these rights as a result of the
robbing of people of their land.

That is how mineral rights were acquired in South Africa, and if we retain
these as locked up, we lock out not only South Africans who have been
historically disempowered and impoverished, but also foreign direct
investors.

I have it on good authority from the companies themselves that that they
are interested in what we are doing because it is unlocking value and
unlocking potential, and they are looking to partnership with South African
blacks in the mining industry, going forward. [Applause.]

Thank you very much for the support on these issues. [Applause.]

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     The Speaker of the National Assembly,  as  Chairperson,  presented  the
     First Report of the Rules Committee of the National Assembly, dated  21
     June 2002, as follows:


     The  Rules  Committee  of  the  National  Assembly  having   considered
     proposals for the amendment of  the  Rules  of  the  National  Assembly
     recommends the following amendments to the Rules:


     Replace Chapter 10 with the following Chapter:

              question will be put.


         (3)     Questions delivered to the Secretary before  12:00  on  any
              working day may appear on the Question  Paper  on  the  second

              member of the Cabinet.


         (6)     If a notice of a question offends against the  practice  or
              these Rules the Speaker  may  either  amend  the  question  or
              return it to the member who submitted it.


         (7)     A member may give notice or take charge of  a  question  on
              behalf of an absent member if the member has  been  authorised
              to do so by the absent member.


         Part 2: Questions for oral reply


     Form and arrangement of questions


     108.   (1)   A member who wants an oral reply to a question must  write

     delivered to the Secretary in terms of Rule 107(2).


     (2)    A question for  oral  reply  may  not  contain  more  than  five
         subdivisions.
     (3)    If the Speaker is of the opinion that a question  deals  with  a
         matter of a statistical nature, the Speaker  may  direct  that  the
         question be placed on the Question Paper for written reply.


     (4)    Questions for oral reply are limited to two questions per member
         per question day.


     (5)    The restrictions imposed by Subrule (4)  and  by  Rules  109(5),

         writing of the order in which those questions are to be  placed  on
         the Question Paper.


     (8)    Questions that cannot be placed on the Question Paper  for  oral
         reply because of quotas must be placed  as  questions  for  written
         reply.


     (9)    The sequence of questions on the Question Paper rotates  without
         interruption for the duration of an  annual  session  according  to
         the order in which  members  of  the  respective  parties  may  put
         questions. That order is determined by the Chief Whips' Forum  from
         time to time.


              NOTE: Appropriate amendment to Rule 221 (Functions and  Powers
              of Chief Whips' Forum) requires consideration.


     Questions to Ministers


     109.   (1)   Questions for oral reply by Ministers must be  dealt  with
     in accordance with three clusters of portfolios of government  affairs,
     as determined from time  to  time  by  the  Chief  Whips'  Forum  after

     the ATC.


              NOTE: Appropriate amendment to Rule 221 (Functions and  Powers
              of Chief Whips' Forum) requires consideration.


     (2)    The clusters  rotate  on  a  weekly  basis,  so  that  questions
         relating to  each  respective  cluster  are  answered  every  third
         question day (subject to Subrules (3) and (4)).


     (3)    If a Minister is absent on a day when questions relating to  the
         relevant cluster are to be answered and  those  questions  are  not
         answered by another  Cabinet  Member  or  by  the  Deputy  Minister
         concerned, the Speaker may, if requested to do so by the member  in
         whose  name  a  question  to  that  Minister  stands,   and   after
         consultation with the Leader of Government Business, direct that -


         (a)     questions to that Minister be placed on the Question Paper
              for the first question session for Ministers following that
              day; and


         (b)     an additional 30 minutes be added to the question time for
              that session.

         according to Rule 108(9) is interrupted at the end of a question

           (b)   the Deputy President is scheduled to answer  questions  in
                 the Council,


     questions to the Deputy President must not be scheduled for that  week,

         session to the Deputy President starts from  the  point  where  the
         order was so interrupted.


     (6)    Notwithstanding Rule 107, questions to the Deputy President must
         be submitted by party representatives in prioritized  order  before

          The Portfolio Committee on Housing, having undertaken a study tour
          to KwaZulu-Natal from 1 to 4 April 2002 and to North West on  from
          7 to 11 April 2002, reports as follows:


         I.  Introduction
         A multi-party delegation of the Committee undertook  a  study  tour
         to KwaZulu-Natal from 1 to 4 April 2002 and North West  from  7  to
         11 April 2002.  The  delegation  to  KwaZulu-Natal  was  under  the
         leadership of Ms Z  Kota  (Chairperson),  and  consisted  of  eight
         members and one official, namely Ms M N Buthelezi  (ANC),  Ms  M  P
         Coetzee-Kasper (ANC), Mr G D Schneemann (ANC), Ms M S Maine  (ANC),
         Ms S H Ntombela (ANC), Ms J A Semple (DP), Mr B W  Dhlamini  (IFP),
         Mr D G Mkono (UDM) and  Ms  A  Jojozi  (Committee  Secretary).  The
         delegation to North West was also under the leadership of Ms  Kota.
         It consisted of nine members  and  one  official,  namely  Mr  D  C
         Mabena (ANC), Ms M S Maine (ANC),  Mr  J  H  Nash  (ANC),  Ms  S  H
         Ntombela (ANC), Mr G D Schneemann (ANC), Mr W M Skhosana (ANC),  Ms
         J A Semple (DP), Mr B M Douglas (IFP), Mr D G Mkono (UDM) and Ms  A
         Jojozi (Committee Secretary).


     II. Objectives of tour


     The Committee went on tour with the following objectives:


     * To fulfil  its  monitoring  and  oversight  function,  the  Committee
         intended to establish progress made with the "Housing  the  Nation"
         programmes.


     * To have exchanges of  views  and  experiences  with  both  provincial
         portfolio committees on housing, mayors of different  areas,  local
         ward councils, contractors and developers.


     * To visit various  housing  projects  such  as  the  People's  Housing
         Process, rural housing  projects,  hostel  redevelopment  projects,
         projects developed by women and other inner city Developments.


     * To establish whether units constructed are in  line  with  norms  and
         standards stipulated in the housing policy.


     The aim of the government is for all South Africans to  have  permanent
     residential structures with secure tenure, where there will be privacy,
     water and adequate sanitary facilities, including  waste  disposal  and
     domestic electricity supply. For the housing challenge to be  met,  the
     aim of the government is to establish  a  sustainable  housing  process
     through a national housing strategy which will  eventually  enable  all
     South Africans to secure housing in a safe and healthy environment  and
     within  viable  communities  in  a  manner  which  contributes  to   an
     integrated society.


     III.   Observations


     The Committee would like to commend MEC D Makhaye and MEC D Africa,  as
     well as departmental officials, for the support given to the  Committee
     during the tour and for the good work they have done in  ensuring  that
     the lives of the poor are improved. Homeless people have been  provided
     with  shelter  and  this  was  evident  in  the  interaction  that  the
     delegation had with the different communities.


     IV.    KwaZulu-Natal


     A.  Visit


         1.  Introduction


              The  delegation  visited  10  housing  projects  in  different
              municipal areas. On the second day  of  the  site  visit,  the
              delegation met with the MEC, Mr D Makhaye. He provided a brief
              outline of the future plans of the Department in ensuring that
              the poorest of the  poor  are  sheltered.  The  tour  included
              meetings with mayors of the different municipalities. Projects
              visited included visits to low-income housing projects, hostel
              projects, middle-income  housing  projects  and  the  People's
              Housing Process. Officials of the Department  accompanied  the
              delegation.


         2.  Meeting with MEC D Makhaye


              In the meeting the MEC raised the following:


              From 1994 to date, about 224 169  housing  opportunities  have
              been created. In the same period, a total  of  90  281  houses
              have been built. A total of 155 670 service  sites  have  been
              completed. Under the guidance of Minister Makhaye, the rate of
              housing delivery in the province has increased by 80% for  the
              financial year 2000-01, compared to previous years.


         3.  Size of housing units


              National norms and standards stipulate that no  house  smaller
              than 30 m2 will be  built.  This  is  vigorously  enforced  in
              KwaZulu-Natal, with the  result  that  proposals  for  housing
              projects where houses less than 30m2 will be  built,  are  not
              even considered. The Minister is adamant that he is not  going
              to approve project proposals where norms and standards are not
              followed.


         4.  Rural housing programme


              The Department reaffirms its commitment  to  ensure  that  the
              lives  of  people  in  the  rural  areas  are  improved.   The
              Department will work with Amakhosi and municipalities to fast-
              track  the  rural  housing  programme.  With  regard  to  this
              programme, the Department has approved rural housing  projects
              valued at R210 million between December 2000  and  July  2001.
              The Department subscribes strongly to the  notion  that  rural
              housing projects should be in line with the  Integrated  Rural
              Development Strategy (IRDS). This  will  ensure  that  service
              delivery impact is maximised and that a co-ordinated  approach
              to rural development is  enhanced.  Another  R37  million  for
              rural housing projects was set aside for 2001-02.


         5.  Slum clearance


              The programme to rid the province of slums was borne out of an
              observation that, although normal housing projects  benefitted
              mainly former slum dwellers, there was need to have a specific
              programme for slums in order to fast-track the  betterment  of
              the lives of the people. Slum clearance has grown to be one of
              the most successful of the Department's  programmes.  This  is
              evidenced by the  fact  that  towards  the  end  of  2002  the
              Department launched the  biggest  slum  clearance  project  in
              partnership with the  Ethekwini  Unicity  Council.  This  R200
              million project, which is already under way,  is  expected  to
              provide housing to 10Â 850 families who  have  been  living  in
              slums in and around the greater Durban area. All urban housing
              projects that the Department has launched, should be  regarded
              as "slum clearance projects" because  most  beneficiaries  are
              from slums.


         6.  Rehabilitation of houses damaged during political violence


              Promoting sustainable peace is a priority of  the  Department.
              It recognises the damage and pain caused by political violence
              in the souls and homes of ordinary South Africans. To try  and
              reduce the pain suffered by the people,  business  plans  were
              prepared and the Department received an amount of R25  million
              allocated from the  Provincial  Peace  Fund.  During  2000-01,
              houses damaged during political violence  in  different  areas
              (Mpumalanga,  Ezakheni,  Wembezi,  Kwa  Mashu,  Imbali)   were
              identified for rehabilitation. As a result of the  success  of
              these projects, a "crisis of achievement"  scenario  has  been
              created, as more and  more  communities  are  approaching  the
              Department for help to rehabilitate houses  damaged  in  their
              areas. However, the money allocated for that is  exhausted  at
              present.


         7.  Housing projects for flood victims


              The Department has been getting projects under way,  aimed  at
              housing families affected by the floods of late 1999 and early
              2000. A total of R24 million was allocated to  the  Department
              for the reconstruction of flood-damaged houses. A R7,2 million
              project has been completed in Mkhuze, and similar projects are
              under  way  in  Mahlabathini,   Mpumalanga,   Mpophomeni   and
              Impendle, totalling R21 million. In Macambini, Chatsworth  and
              Ezimokodweni a total of R1,2 million  has  been  paid  out  in
              cheques to communities, depending on the extent of the damage.


         8.  Fighting fraud and corruption


              The fight against fraud and corruption  has  been  intensified
              and is yielding results. Forensic investigations are conducted
              by independent firms to look into  allegations  of  fraud  and
              corruption. For example,  a  developer  who  had  carried  out
              shoddy work,  was  asked  to  rectify  it  at  his  own  cost.
              Developers who have  received  double  payments,  are  already
              paying back the Department, while some  cases  of  fraud  have
              been referred to  the  SAPS.  Action  is  also  taken  against
              corrupt  officials  within  the  Department.  Fraud  has  been
              discovered within the Department and some  officials  involved
              have been arrested. The investigation is still continuing. The
              aim is to eliminate corruption within the  Department  and  to
              crack the  whip  on  those  officials  not  performing  up  to
              standard.
         9.  HIV/AIDS


              The incidence of HIV/AIDS in KwaZulu-Natal is  too  high,  and
              there is still no cure for it. The Department believes  itself
              to be the  only  housing  Department  to  have  established  a
              housing policy for HIV/AIDS victims and to approve houses  for
              HIV/AIDS patients. The AIDS project  involves  the  Department
              providing funds to institutions who wish  to  provide  cluster
              homes for persons affected by HIV/AIDS, in particular children
              who are orphans as a result of the syndrome, for  as  long  as
              the institution in its discretion deems it necessary, and  for
              those abandoned by  families  because  of  their  HIV  status.
              Subsidies are also provided for families that care  for  AIDS-
              infected children.


         10. Human settlement redevelopment pilot programme


              It is the policy of  the  Department  to  improve  the  socio-
              economic conditions of people living in dilapidated houses and
              informal settlements. All spheres  of  government  agree  that
              there is need to build  on  the  experience  gained  from  the
              programme of special presidential projects on  urban  renewal.
              In the overall quest for more efficient and  productive  urban
              and rural areas, and to move away from apartheid  patterns  of
              the past, the Department supports the projects under the human
              settlement redevelopment pilot programme.  To  implement  this
              initiative the Department  has  embarked  on  a  programme  to
              improve the quality of the living  environment  by  addressing
              the legacy of the dysfunctional.


         11. Empowering emerging contractors


              Economic empowerment of the previously disadvantaged group  is
              one of  the  Department's  key  focus  areas.  The  Department
              utilises and will  continue  utilising  emerging  contractors,
              including women contractors and developers.
         12. Hostel redevelopment programme


              The objective of the programme is  to  promote  humane  living
              conditions  and  improve  the  quality  of  life   of   hostel
              residents.  The  Department  is  striving  towards  converting
              single accommodation to family units.  Affected  residents  as
              well as  informal  residents  are  relocated  to  new  housing
              projects via the project-linked subsidy  scheme.  Negotiations
              were entered into with a number of local authorities to manage
              the upgrading programme. A total of R60 million was  allocated
              for upgrading and redeveloping hostels.


         13. Problems experienced by Department


              (a) When the government took  over  in  1994,  there  were  no
                  specifications in respect of  contracts.  Some  structures
                  built by developers were as small as 18 to 20m2. This  was
                  discussed with the developers, but  the  Department  could
                  not take  them  to  court,  as  the  contracts  signed  by
                  developers had no specifications. From 1999,  though,  the
                  quality of houses has dramatically changed.


              (b)  Some  municipalities  do  not  have  the   capacity   and
                  experience   financial   constraints.   Once   they    are
                  capacitated, they will be able to operate efficiently  and
                  effectively.


         14. Conclusion


              The Department is replacing  the  "Developer-Driven  Paradigm"
              with a new "Community-Driven Housing Process".


     B.  Meeting with Ethekwini Municipality


         The Executive Mayor of Durban, Mr O Mlaba, briefed the  delegation,
         as follows:


         In the past,  houses  were  built  for  the  people,  and  now  the
         municipality is focusing on building  human  settlements.  Most  of
         the houses that the delegation saw, were  houses  that  were  built
         based on the old policies formulated by  the  previous  government.
         They were approved by the old administration  under  old  policies.
         The KwaZulu-Natal administration is still operating under  the  old
         administrative systems, hence the problems  experienced.  According
         to new housing policies, all projects  should  have  tarred  roads,
         water-borne sewage and units built should not be  less  than  30m2.
         The municipality is  now  trying  to  investigate  whether  housing
         policies in place are working well for the people. Over 30% of  the
         costs of developing projects are contributed by the city council.


     C.  Meeting with Newcastle Municipality - Madadeni K Housing Project


         The meeting took place  at  the  municipality  offices,  where  the
         delegation  met  local  councillors,  members  of  the   provincial
         housing committee and developers. The delegation  was  welcomed  by
         the Council, but due to time  limits  had  to  rush  to  the  first
         project in Madadeni K.


         1.  Background to Project


              R25 million was handed over to the Newcastle Local Council  by
              the MEC for Housing, Mr Dumisane Makhaye, for use in the  slum
              clearance project. The funds were  to  be  utilised  to  build
              homes for families living in squatter camps around  Newcastle.
              The MEC donated a further R936 000 to 624 families whose homes
              were devastated by the storms which hit Newcastle in  February
              2000.


         2.  Project profile


              The Department approved  R3,2  million  to  build  258  double
              housing units to house different families. The units built are
              70m2, split into two and separated by a wall, with each family
              getting 35m2, with full waterborne sewerage and  piped  water.
              The houses have  one  bedroom,  a  lounge,  a  kitchen  and  a
              bathroom with a toilet and shower. There is only one water tap
              in the house. Where possible, the Department has ensured  that
              it is beneficiaries from the same family who  share  the  70m2
              dwelling, in order to avoid squabbles.  The  project  employed
              about 140 local people, who  later  received  building  skills
              certificates from Fideco Homes. These certificates were to  be
              accredited by the Department of Labour.


              The developer recommended to undertake the development is  Mrs
              Claudette Keene of Fideco Homes, who has been involved in  the
              building industry for nine years. Fideco Homes has achieved  a
              Merit  Housing  Developer  Award  for  2000.  Mrs  Keene   has
              established a good working relationship with the Department.


              The Department has made an effort to keep the greenery  (trees
              and grass). Some relatives (extended  family)  who  share  the
              same 70m2 have decided to extend them and occupy them  as  one
              family.
         3.  Problems experienced


              (a) The fact that there are two families living under the same
                  roof is creating conflict between the neighbours,  because
                  one complains about the noise the other one is making.


              (b) Two families occupying the same 70m2  have  been  fighting
                  because the one wants to take over the other one's  space.
                  (For example, a brother wanting to take over the house  of
                  his sister.)


              (c)  Most  of  the  houses  have  cracks   because   of   poor
                  workmanship. For example, door handles are  loose,  floors
                  and walls are damaged  and  roofs  are  leaking,  but  the
                  developer has promised to rectify these (K126 & K955).


              (d) The structural design of the toilet wall is a problem. The
                  wall does  not  go  up  to  the  roof,  and  this  creates
                  problems when someone is using  the  toilet  while  others
                  are enjoying their meal. This forms a health hazard.


              (e) The community made it clear that they are not  happy  with
                  the houses and that they prefer stand-alone houses.


              (f) The occupant of K92A complained about her  toilet  system,
                  that was not installed properly. The  toilet  is  blocked,
                  and this results in  sewage  overflowing.  She  complained
                  that Fideco Homes is aware of  the  problem  but  has  not
                  assisted in reparing  the  toilet.  Mrs  Keene  of  Fideco
                  Homes promised that  she  would  ensure  that  the  toilet
                  would be fixed.


              (g) More houses still need to be built in the area,  as  there
                  are many people without shelter.


              (h) The project  is  not  a  women  empowerment  project.  The
                  developer was told that women  are  to  be  included,  not
                  only as workers but also as shareholders.


         4.  Recommendations


              (a) The Committee recommends  that  in  future  only  separate
                  houses be built, regardless of whether the  occupants  are
                  family.


              (b) The  developer  should  address  complaints  laid  by  the
                  beneficiaries relating to poor workmanship.


     D.  Meeting with Mooi River Municipality


         The Mayor could not attend the meeting, as he  was  not  well.  The
         town secretary gave a brief background of the  three  projects  the
         municipality  and   highlighted   the   problems   experienced   in
         Bruntville, as follows:


         The Bruntville problem  started  in  1999  and,  according  to  the
         Department, it is a policy issue that needs to  be  rectified.  The
         provincial housing committee visited  the  project  previously  and
         will be addressing the matter with the  relevant  authorities.  The
         Department has also promised to address the problem  together  with
         the council and  to  ensure  that  the  houses  in  Bruntville  are
         occupied. There are beneficiaries on the waiting list  who  can  be
         located in these houses. The problem is that there is no  procedure
         or  policy  that  can  be  used  to  allocate  the  houses  to  new
         beneficiaries, as other people already own the houses.


     E.  Bruntville Housing Project


         1.  Project profile


              The size of the houses is 30m2. The houses were built in  1995
              when the minimum  requirement  was  28m2.  The  value  of  the
              projects is about R7 741 800.


         2.  Problems experienced


              (a) Some of the houses have been built on a flood plain, which
                  resulted in some houses being flooded when it rained.


              (b) Certain houses have been built on top  of  springs,  which
                  resulted in them being continually damp.


              (c) Water sewage pipes are clearly visible above  the  ground,
                  making them vulnerable to vandalism and water wastage.


              (d) Sewer waste is flowing into some yards that are lower than
                  those of their neighbours.


              (e)  Unoccupied  houses  were  vandalised  (e.g.  window   and
                  doorframes  were  removed.  Beneficiaries  have   deserted
                  their  houses  and  have  left  Mooi  River  because   the
                  factories that they used to work in have closed  down.  To
                  be able to address this  problem,  the  municipality  will
                  have to take responsibility of the houses. The  Department
                  will hand over the houses to  the  municipality.  However,
                  the municipality  cannot  allocate  these  houses  to  new
                  beneficiaries. They  have  to  inform  the  owners  first,
                  which they do by advertising  in  the  newspapers.  Should
                  they not respond, the houses are then allocated  to  those
                  on the waiting list.


              (f) Certain houses have  deep  cracks  in  walls,  bacause  of
                  structural defects.


              (g) Most of the people in the area are unemployed and there is
                  high crime rate.


         3.  Recommendations


              (a) The Committee is interested in finding  out  exactly  what
                  the Department intends  doing  to  ensure  that  there  is
                  economic activity in Mooi River. It  recommends  that  the
                  Department interact with and  request  the  Department  of
                  Trade and Industry to assist in identifying possible  ways
                  of ensuring that economic activity  is  restored  in  Mooi
                  River.


              (b) The developer should repair the cracks in the walls.


              (c) The MEC should try and ensure that:


                  *   Mooi  River  municipality  speed  up  the  process  of
                       identifying beneficiaries who will occupy the  vacant
                       houses. Advertisements should be on the radio as well


                  *   Flowing sewer waste be rectified so that it  does  not
                       result in residents picking up from diseases


                  *    The Bruntville town Planner, engineer  and  developer
                       submit an explanation as to why the  sewerage  system
                       was not properly installed  and  why  there  was  bad
                       workmanship in the units.


     F.  Meeting with Mngeni Municipality


         The delegation was briefed by the technical  director  on  problems
         experienced by the municipality. He briefed the delegation  on  the
         home development  project,  which  has  three  phases.  The  phases
         differ in terms of quality; the project  was  developed  by  Howick
         TLC. With reference to phase 3 of the  project,  beneficiaries  are
         on the waiting list, as houses are still not complete.  The  houses
         are  small  and  of  low  quality,  with  very  small  yards,   bad
         foundations, and inferior roofing and window panes.  There  are  no
         proper tarred roads in the area. The units that are occupied,  have
         been improved and renovated mostly bt the beneficiaries. There  are
         no Peoples Housing Process, but emerging  contractors  are  awarded
         tenders where they qualify.  Houses  being  built  at  present  are
         38m2. Women in Howick have not been involved in building  projects,
         as they still need training in building skills. The whole  province
         has been under a moratorium as regards  individual  subsidies;  the
         Department  is  helping  those  who   submit   individual   subsidy
         applications.


     G.  Meeting with Msunduzi Municipality


         1.  Briefing by Mayor of Msunduzi


              (a) Rental stock


                  The  Council  owns  substantial  rental  stock  and  these
                  generate some income to sustain the  organisation  and  at
                  the same time offer housing to  the  homeless  and  needy.
                  The previous Council created a s21  company  and  some  of
                  the present Council members  are  board  members  of  this
                  company. No projects  were  implemented  by  the  previous
                  Council, as they had encountered many  problems.  Problems
                  experienced  included  resistance  from  non-ANC  and  IFP
                  housing board  members.  The  Council  is  grappling  with
                  issues of  providing  good  service  to  the  people.  The
                  problem is beneficiaries who are not  satisfied  with  the
                  size of the houses they are offered.


              (b) Slum clearance


                  Houses have been built in order to do away  with  informal
                  settlements  in  the  area.  The  Council  is  hoping   to
                  relocate people to the new  houses  by  the  end  of  June
                  2002.  2Â 000  houses  have  been  built  and  two  of  the
                  projects are in  Greenfields.  The  Council  welcomes  the
                  increase in subsidy as  it  will  benefit  the  people  by
                  affording them better  houses  when  combined  with  their
                  contribution.


         2.  Recommendation


              The Committee is concerned about  councillors  who  are  board
              members, as this may affect their objectivity.


     H.  Meeting with Matatiel Municipality


         The Mayor gave a brief background of the Harry Gwala Park  Project.
         He highlighted the following points:


         The size of the houses built in Harry Gwala range from 30  to  35m2
         but there are also houses that are 17m2. Some  people  who  qualify
         for 30m2, have been allocated 17m2. This creates a problem, as  the
         Council does not understand how it could have  happened.  There  is
         another project in Matatiel, the Njongoville Project,  where  small
         houses have been built for the people. Some  of  the  beneficiaries
         were not happy with the size of the houses and  developers  offered
         to give them loans to the amount of R10 000. These  loans  were  to
         assist them to extend  their  houses.  Some  of  the  beneficiaries
         could not pay back the loan and developers  sold  their  houses  to
         those who could afford it. The MEC is aware of the problem  and  is
         trying to resolve it legally. A library and a shopping centre  were
         also built, both by women.


         Harry Gwala Park - Matatiel Area C - Rural Project


         1.  Project profile


              The project has about 1Â 124 sites and is a rural project which
              is developer-driven. The project was approved  in  March  1999
              and was started  on  1  April  2002.  The  expected  date  for
              completion is 30 July 2002. One of the reasons for  the  delay
              is the fact that beneficiary approval was  delayed  due  to  a
              change in beneficiaries. Provision  for  schools,  clinics,  a
              crÃ©che and a community hall has been made. The houses are 30m2
              and 35m2 and will be electrified with waterborne  sewage.  The
              Council has approved R1,6 million for building a taxi rank.  A
              community hall will be built soon. A  R780  000  contract  has
              been awarded for  a  walkway  bridge.  Trees  have  also  been
              planted.


         2.  Problems experienced


              The  community  issued  the  delegation  with  a  summary   of
              grievances and the Mayor assured the  delegation  that  issues
              raised have been addressed.


              The community is complaining of the following:


              (a) Some people who  previously  qualified  for  vacant  plots
                  cannot  afford  to  build  houses  as   some   have   been
                  retrenched and do not have a source of income.


              (b) Some people have been allocated more than one house  while
                  others sell theirs or lease them.


              (c) They are not happy that Stedeone Construction was  awarded
                  the tender. They believe that  it  does  not  deserve  the
                  contract, as they came third in the tendering process.


              (d) They are questioning the criteria  used  when  houses  are
                  allocated.


              (e) Some people use their houses for business purposes.


              (f) The  developer  approached  beneficiaries  who  wanted  to
                  extend their houses and offered them a loan  of  R10  000.
                  Some beneficiaries could not afford to pay back  the  loan
                  and the developer repossessed their houses.


              (g) Funds allocated for the walkway bridge were never utilised
                  as the bridge has not yet been built.


         3.  Recommendations


              (a) The Department should ensure that  people  who  previously
                  qualified for vacant plots are placed on the waiting  list
                  for the subsidy.


              (b) The matter of developers  repossessing  houses  should  be
                  dealt with legally and the Minister should be  made  aware
                  of it.


     I.  Meeting with Greater Kokstad Municipality


         The municipal manager highlighted the following points:


         The Bhongweni project has not  been  successful  as  the  developer
         went bankrupt. This has left the project  incomplete.  6Â 000  units
         with 33m2 units have been built in the last  two-and-a-half  years,
         and a tender to complete an additional 100 units has been put  out.
         The cost of installing  electricity  was  about  R10  million,  but
         installation  has  not  been  completed.  About  400   houses   are
         unoccupied   and   the   Department   is   struggling   to   locate
         beneficiaries. No complaints have been received  on  the  standards
         and quality of the houses. Within the  Kokstad  Municipality  there
         are six rural projects,  and  the  municipality  is  succeeding  in
         delivering houses. Local people are utilised to build houses;  they
         were  also  utilised  to  build  houses  in  the  People's  Housing
         Process. Kokstad has, however, stopped  implementing  the  People's
         Housing Process. Another project  was  approved  for  the  People's
         Housing Process, but the community  opted  for  a  developer-driven
         project.


         The Housing Board and the Department of Housing  were  very  useful
         and  co-operative  in  ensuring  that  the  tender  processes  were
         approved quickly in Kokstad.


     J.  Bhongweni


         Project profile


         6Â 000 units have been built in the past two-and-a-half  years.  The
         developer went bankrupt and the project is not complete.  In  phase
         I, 400 houses are unoccupied, as beneficiaries  have  vanished  and
         the  Department  is  struggling  to  locate  them.  200  of   those
         beneficiaries have been located. The  houses  that  were  initially
         built, were 25m2, and now 30m2 houses are being built. The size  of
         the houses to be built in phase 2 of the project will be 40m2.


     K.  Meeting with Ugu Municipal Housing


         Within Ugu Municipality,  two  projects  that  will  be  community-
         driven have been approved. 733 houses will be built  in  the  first
         project and 2Â 000 units in the  second  project.  R18  million  was
         approved for the two projects. There are delays in commencing  with
         the projects and the  Council  is  grappling  with  initiating  the
         People's Housing  Process.  Initially  there  was  no  director  of
         housing in the municipality, but one has been  appointed  recently.
         Developers are facing huge challenges, including shortage  of  land
         to build houses.


     L.  Gamalakhe Tin Town - People's Housing Process - Port Shepstone


         1.  Background to project


              The community of Tin Town initiated the construction of houses
              as there was a great shortage in the area. They realised  that
              given a chance to build or organise the  extensions  to  their
              homes themselves, they could achieve a greater level of  value
              for money. The Gamalakhe Tin  Town  project  was  approved  in
              March 1998 and was completed in December 2000. The project was
              managed by  a  partnership  between  the  housing  development
              committee formed by the  community,  known  as  the  Gamalakhe
              Development Trust, the provincial  government  and  the  local
              authority.


              The community identified its housing problem and  initiated  a
              programme to provide its own housing.  The  houses  they  were
              living in before, were tin houses (shacks).  The  project  was
              funded by the Department.


         2.  Project profile


              People of the community constructed the houses utilising their
              own  skills.  They  also  provided  personnel  to  manage  the
              material supply programme. Certain members  of  the  community
              also managed the allocation procedure, which included all  the
              documentation. The action of the community in completing their
              own houses  encouraged  more  social  responsibility  and  the
              managing of their own affairs on a broader  scale.  They  used
              the People's Housing  Process  to  achieve  the  objective  of
              completing 600 houses for families with incomes below R1  500.
              The houses included individual water  and  sewer  connections,
              which  were  included  in  the   budget.   The   blocks   were
              manufactured   by   the   community   and   this    stimulated
              entrepreneurship within the community. The community committee
              continues to tackle ongoing community needs such  as  security
              and health.


              The houses have one bedroom and a bathroom with a  toilet  and
              shower. The tin shacks that the beneficiaries used  are  still
              at the back of the two-roomed  houses.  The  project  won  the
              nomination for best housing  project.  The  beneficiaries  are
              happy  with  their  houses  and  they  are  grateful  to   the
              Department for providing them with decent homes.


     M.  Bhobhoyi Show House


         The show house has been finished and the project has been  approved
         but no houses have been built yet. The show house  has  been  built
         with good quality material and  has  tiles  for  roofing.  The  top
         structure  costs   about   R10Â 445   and   services   R7Â 245.   The
         beneficiaries will be trained to build the houses  themselves.  The
         project is part of the People's Housing Process, and the  developer
         will also be involved in building the houses.


     N.  Kwa Dukuza


         Shakaville Men's Hostel


         1.  Background to project


              Preliminary investigations to upgrade the  hostel  started  in
              1994 (upgrade existing building with new  ablution  facilities
              and shower  area).  The  tender  to  upgrade  the  hostel  was
              advertised on  4  November  1998.  Consultants  Csko  Coltzee,
              Steyn, Kruger, Oelsen (?) from Richard's Bay were appointed by
              the Department of Housing as project managers. In  July  1999,
              the Department awarded  the  tender  to  a  local  contractor,
              Multipro Construction Company, for an amount of R352 000.


         2.  Project profile


              The men's hostel consists of three blocks with 44 rooms and  a
              population of approximately 100 residents, including families.
              The hostel upgrade was completed in December  1999.  A  hostel
              committee is in place and residents pay R40 for rental,  which
              includes  communal  water,   maintenance,   bed   rental   and
              caretaking. Rentals are collected  and  paid  into  the  local
              authority's account. Each  room  has  a  pre-paid  electricity
              meter. The local authority is presently doing emergency day-to-
              day maintenance and administration of the hostel.  The  family
              units have one room, which is used as a bedroom and a kitchen.
              There is a communal bathroom with toilets and showers. A woman
              is employed to clean the yard and the bathroom.


         Shakaville Women's Hostel


         1.  Project profile


              On 23 November 2000 the Kwa Dukuza  Municipality  awarded  the
              tender to an  emerging  contractor,  Macingwane  Security  and
              Gardening Services, for an amount of  R116  000.  Construction
              commenced in January 2001 and was completed in May  2001.  The
              women's hostel has one block with 36 female  residents.  There
              are 11 rooms and a bathroom with toilets  and  showers.  There
              are about two to three occupants sharing one room and using it
              as a bedroom and kitchen. The plan is to allocate these  women
              to family units that are going to be built. There is a  hostel
              committee in place and the residents pay R40 for rental, which
              includes  communal  water,   maintenance,   bed   rental   and
              caretaking. Both the men's and women's hostels are well kept.


         2.  Recommendation


              The issue of more than one person sharing  a  room  should  be
              discouraged. One person should  be  allocated  to  a  room  as
              occupants deserve privacy.


         Shakaville Family Units


         R294 000 is available from the Department as a  pilot  project  for
         the construction of family units. This aspect  is  presently  being
         discussed with the  hostel  development  committee  and  the  local
         authority.


     O.  Newlands West - People's Dialogue


         1.  Background to project


              To access land for the  housing  project,  the  South  African
              People's Homeless Federation, on behalf of the community,  had
              to negotiate with the Durban Metro and  the  Department.  Land
              was allocated to the community and loans to build houses  were
              accessed  from  uTshani  Fund  by  those  who  qualified.  The
              beneficiaries are still waiting  for  their  subsidies  to  be
              approved. Once they are, they will be able to pay  back  their
              loans with the subsidy grant. The Durban Metro  arranged  with
              different organisations to offer the community training on the
              maintenance of the project. The community had saved  money  to
              assist them to contribute towards subsidies.


         2.  Project profile


              The houses are 56m2 in size, with four rooms - two bedrooms, a
              lounge, a kitchen and a bathroom with a  toilet  and  bathtub.
              They were built by women. Each house has a waterborne sewerage
              system and a water tap. The houses are big with two doors, one
              in the kitchen and the other in the lounge. The loan  accessed
              from uTshani Fund is R10 000 and beneficiaries  have  to  make
              repayments of R120  every  month.  Some  beneficiaries  raised
              additional funds to build bigger houses.


         3.  Stakeholders involved


              (a) Durban City Council


              (b) International organisations


              (c) Newlands community


         4.  Problems experienced


              (a) The project has been  delayed  because  the  beneficiaries
                  cannot  afford  to  proceed  with  construction   due   to
                  financial constraints.


              (b)  15  beneficiaries  have  passed  away,  which  makes   it
                  difficult for their loans to be repaid.


              (c) There  is  corruption  with  regard  to  the  delivery  of
                  building material. Building material  is  often  delivered
                  to those who do not qualify  for  delivery.  Some  of  the
                  houses of beneficiaries who are first on the waiting  list
                  are still not complete due to allocation  of  material  to
                  the "wrong" beneficiaries.


              (d) The community believes that officials are not honest  when
                  they say their subsidies are not yet  approved.  They  are
                  suggesting  that  the  Council  should  intervene  in  the
                  matter.


              Despite the problems experienced by the community, this is  an
              exceptional projects, as it  incorporates  the  RDP  principle
              that puts people at the centre of its development.


         5.  Recommendations


              (a) Local government should implement job creation projects to
                  assist in fighting unemployment amongst the  residents  of
                  Newlands West.


     P.  Kwa Dabeka Hostel - Pinetown


         1.  Project profile


              The hostel consist of  nine  multi-storey  buildings  and  has
              about 11 230 formal residents and 3  770  informal  residents.
              The Department is doing emergency day-to-day  maintenance  and
              administration. So far an amount of  R26,5  million  has  been
              spent for upgrading electrical distribution boards and partial
              external upgrading of block H.


              In order to embark on a  pilot  project  25  dormitories  were
              converted to make provision for 25 family units in block A.  A
              further R20 million was made available to  continue  with  the
              upgrading programme. Another R20 million was made available to
              continue  with  the  upgrading  programme  and  also  for  the
              provision of  family  units.  Rentals  are  collected  by  the
              Department and deposited into the Inner  West  City  Council's
              account. Rental ranges from  R11  to  R25,  depending  on  the
              number of residents per room. The tender  was  awarded  to  35
              different contractors. Local people were  trainied  to  assist
              with the renovations. The units have a  bathroom  with  basin,
              toilet and shower, two bedrooms, lounge  and  a  kitchen.  The
              community was consulted before the renovations were done.


         2.  Observations


              When the delegation  arrived  in  the  afternoon,  electricity
              lights were on and there  were  water  leakages.  The  general
              appearance of the outside surroundings was not good.


         3.  Recommendations


              (a)  Control  measures  should  be  addressed  by  the  hostel
                  management.


              (b) Maintenance of the hostel needs to  be  improved  and  the
                  environment cleaned on a continuous basis.


     Q.  Thokoza Women's Hostel - Central Durban
         The Thokoza Women's hostel consist  of  three  hostel  blocks  with
         1Â 010 formal residents and 990  informal  residents.  Thus  far  an
         amount of R14 million  was  spent  on  upgrading  the  hostel.  The
         Ethekwini Municipality is presently doing, at its own cost, day-to-
         day maintenance  and  administration.  Rent  is  collected  by  the
         Ethekwini Municipality and ranges from R6,65 to  R50,50,  depending
         on the number of residents per room. The kitchen  and  toilets  are
         communal. The general appearance of the hostel is  good  as  it  is
         kept clean.


     R.  Comments


         The Committee intends to revisit KwaZulu-Natal. The  programme  was
         drafted in such a way that it did not cater  for  distances  to  be
         travelled. This resulted in the delegation spending little time  in
         the areas visited.


         Despite the challenges faced by the province,  delivery  of  houses
         is being speeded  up.  Rural  houses  are  built  and  new  housing
         projects  are  started.  It  is  obvious  that  the  Department  is
         committed to ensure that the lives of the poor are improved.


     V.  North West


     A.  Visit


         1.  Introduction


              The   delegation   visited   eight   projects   in   different
              municipalities and  also  met  with  Mayors,  councillors  and
              relevant ward councillors of the different areas. It met  with
              the housing MEC, Mr D  Africa,  on  the  third  day,  and  was
              accompanied by officials from the Department  for  the  entire
              tour.


         2.  Meeting with MEC


              The challenges of housing and infrastructure are vast and much
              has been done but much remains to be done to ensure equitable,
              sustainable and intergrated settlement development  throughout
              the province. More than 16 000 houses were  delivered  in  the
              province during  the  2001-02  financial  year.  In  order  to
              eradicate the backlog of some 396Â 000 houses, an amount of  R7
              billion is required. Integration at  all  levels,  with  other
              sectors, other spheres of government, will be the only way the
              Department can coherently make a  difference  to  housing  and
              infrastructure delivery.


         3.  Project-linked programme


              This programme entails the establishment of townships and  the
              transfer of full title to individuals. It comprises  94  urban
              and peri-urban projects to  the  value  of  more  than  R1,474
              billion. A total of 41 357 dwellings have been constructed and
              more than 100 000  subsidies  approved  under  this  programme
              during the first six months of the 2001-02 financial year.


         4.  Project-linked rural housing programme
              The  rural  housing  programme  was  finalised  in  1999   and
              different  projects  have  been  launched  in   2000-01.   The
              programme  includes  23  housing  projects  in  rural   areas,
              comprising 22Â 448 subsidies/units to the value  of  more  than
              R355 million. A total of 1Â 655 dwellings have been constructed
              under this programme during the first six months of the  2001-
              02 financial year.


         5.  Individual subsidies programme


              The Housing Code allows individuals  to  access  subsidies.  A
              total of 9Â 524 individual subsidies  have  been  approved  and
              houses built to the value of R294,5 million.  A  total  of  25
              dwellings have been constructed under  this  programme  during
              the first months of the 2001-02 financial year.


         6.  People's Housing Process


              Five housing support centres have been  established  to  date.
              These centres  enable  local  communities  to  create  savings
              schemes from which dwellings  are  financed.  They  have  been
              supported financially by the Department to an amount of nearly
              R50 million, which includes  the  approval  of  3Â 324  housing
              subsidies. The People's  Housing  Process  has  completed  764
              units to date, which are, on average, 50m2 in size. This  year
              at least seven centres, especially in the rural areas, will be
              established.


         7.  Developer-driven individual subsidies


              This  programme  is  targeted  to  assist  SMMEs   and   small
              developers or contractors that are  in  a  position  to  build
              houses up to 100 units at a time. A total of 71 dwellings have
              been constructed under this programme  during  the  first  six
              months of 2001-02 financial year.


         8.  Hostel redevelopment programme


              This programme entails the conversion of  seven  hostels  into
              2Â 172 family units. A total  of  35  hostel  units  have  been
              converted into dwellings under this programme during the first
              six months of the 2001-02 financial year.


         9.  Human settlement redevelopment programme


              The intention is to ensure urban renewal where necessary.  Two
              projects to the value of R13 million have  been  completed  in
              Winterveld and Mafikeng.


         10. Housing projects for flood victims


              An amount of R8,1 million in the form of a  conditional  grant
              was   specifically   allocated   to    the    Department    to
              reconstruct/erect 501 dwellings damaged during the  floods  of
              February 2000. A total of 317 dwellings have been  constructed
              under this programme during the first six months of the  2001-
              02 financial year.
         11. HIV/AIDS


              The possibility of setting aside  houses  to  cater  for  AIDS
              orphans, people  living  with  HIV/AIDS  and  the  elderly  in
              conjunction with relevant welfare and  health  departments  is
              being explored.


         12. Women in housing


              The 10% target set by national housing has  to  be  met  by  1
              April 2003. At  the  moment  there  are  5,7%  women  who  are
              executing 10 housing projects comprising  5Â 270  subsidies  to
              the value of R134 million. In terms  of  the  new  procurement
              policy preference will be given to women developers.


         13. Presidential job summit - rental housing programme


              The national Department of Housing has set aside  funding  for
              the erection of 5Â 000 rental housing units  to  the  value  of
              approximately R250 million in North West, in respect of  which
              75% must be retained for rental purposes and only 25%  may  be
              sold.


         14. Job creation


              The MEC has urged developers  to  address  the  issue  of  job
              creation.


         15. Housing institutions


              The province is concerned at the fact that they  are  excluded
              from the benefits of different housing institutions.


     B.  Briefing by Mr E Sinovich


         Mr Sinovich briefed the delegation on the  new  policy  imperatives
         and challenges faced by the Department, as follows:


         1.  Increase in subsidy


              People's Housing Process beneficiaries will not  be  compelled
              to pay  a  contribution.  The  increase  in  the  subsidy  was
              effective on 1 April 2002 and  it  only  applies  to  projects
              approved after 1 April 2002. The Minister has  been  requested
              to consider the People's Housing Process as an exeption to the
              rule and let  the  effective  date  be  2  January  2002.  The
              Department is still waiting for her approval.


         2.  New procurement regime


              The housing MINMEC on 29 May 2000 approved a proposal  on  the
              procurement principles required to enable the housing  subsidy
              scheme to comply with the provisions of  section  217  of  the
              Constitution. Consequently, on 21  July  2000,  the  heads  of
              housing departments approved  new  procurement  procedures  in
              respect of the housing subsidy scheme. A new complete  process
              for  housing  development  will  be  introduced,   with   fair
              competition in all phases. Firstly, IDPs  will  be  finalised,
              needs  and  priorities  identified  and  suitable  areas   for
              addressing needs will be identified.  Municipalities  will  be
              invited to make provision in their applications for a  profile
              of the communities. Land offer calls will be  made  after  all
              information has been received from municipalities.  Land  will
              be accessed through negotiations with owners if it is  private
              land. Municipalities will conclude  land  purchase  agreements
              with landowners.


              Project description -  municipalities  will  have  to  compile
              project descriptions, which comprise the number of  subsidies,
              and  undertake  to  provide  services  and  land   acquisition
              agreement.


              In order to deliver, it is necessary to appoint a developer to
              manage the project, contractors to  install  services  and  to
              build houses. The developer will then decide how to  undertake
              a project best suited for local circumstances. It will  decide
              on how to construct houses (for instance, the design). It  can
              decide to engage in  the  People's  Housing  Process,  it  can
              execute the project itself or outsource the project.


              Most people prefer to build their own houses but  the  problem
              is they do not fall under the warranty cover  offered  by  the
              National Home Builders Registration Council  (NHBRC).  Another
              problem  is  that  it  takes  time  before  PHP  projects  are
              completed.


              49% of developers in the North West are women, only two of the
              six women developers are emerging ones, the rest being  fully-
              fledged developers.


              Only  a  few  people   receive   free   basic   services,   as
              municipalities  have  no  authority  to  provide   water   and
              electricity. Water is provided  by  the  Department  of  Water
              Affairs and electricity by Eskom.


         3.  Recommendations
              (a) The People's Housing Process must not be excluded from the
                  warranty scheme.


              (b) Policy should ensure that in a developer's contract it  is
                  stipulated  that  local  small   contractors   should   be
                  capacitated and utilised and that first preference  should
                  be given to emerging women contractors.


     C.     Briefing by North West Housing Corporation (NWHC)


         After 1994 transformation took place  and  it  resulted  in  a  new
         company, the Housing Infrastructure  Development  Company  (Hidco).
         There were management problems within the  Company  which  emanated
         from before 1994 and continued after 1994. The role  of  the  board
         had to be changed before it became the NWHC. Until 1997,  the  NWHC
         received funding from the government.


         1.  Financial overview
              The NWHC has stock of R210 million. This include  R20  million
              (flats) and serviced stands (R39 million). All of them are  at
              book value, which on average is 50% below market value.


              Work in progress amount to R42 million
              Accounts receivable - R220 million
              Fixed Assets - R1 million
              Investments - R7 million


              Liabilities of the NWHC  are  mostly  historical  -  long-term
              loans of about R77 million (Public Investment  Commissioners),
              Winterveld Trust (R5 million), accounts payable by SA  Housing
              Trust (R22 million), and retention of about R1 million. It has
              stock worth R210 million.


         2.  Challenges facing NWHC


              (a) Policy and financial


                  The transformation and repositioning process  still  needs
                  to be completed and the legacy problems still needs to  be
                  solved. The NWHC has to reduce its liabilities.


              (b) Housing delivery


                  *   More units have to be delivered.


                  *   The quality and size of the units constructed have  to
                       be improved.


                  *    The  NWHC  has  to  offer  those  who  have   already
                       benefitted an  opportunity  to  improve  and  enlarge
                       their homes.


                  *    It also has to improve access to housing finance  and
                       implement the  discount  benefit  scheme  and,  where
                       applicable, pass ownership.


              (c) Policy


                  *     The  transformation  process  still  needs   to   be
                       completed.


                  *    Transit to HIDCO also has to be completed.


                  *    HIDCO has to be changed into a s21 company.


                  *     All  operations  and  policies  based  on  the   old
                       dispensation still have to be eliminated.


                  *    With the new mandate from the province, the NWHC  has
                       to  be  realigned  (e.g.   introduction   of   social
                       housing).


                  *    The NWHC has to work  with  housing  institutions  at
                       national  level  through   co-operation   and   joint
                       ventures.


              (d) Financial
                  There is a need for the NWHC to:


                  *      Access   short-term   finance   to   pay    current
                       liabilities.


                  *     Collect   accounts   receivable,   especially   from
                       government institutions.


                  *    Become a primary market lender.


                  *    Resolve barriers related to work in progress:


                       - Proclamation R293


                       - Land transfer.


                  *    Renegotiate terms  for  the  loans  obtained  in  the
                       past, if they cannot be turned into grants.


                  The NWHC is requesting the intervention and assistance  of
                  the Committee,  the  Department  of  Housing,  the  Social
                  Housing Foundation, NURCHA and the NHFC in addressing  and
                  solving the following problems:


                  *    The transfer  of  land  among  government  spheres  -
                       there are houses that have  been  built  on  national
                       land - some of the land has been transferred  to  the
                       municipality.


                  *     Properties  in  the  Free  State  -  the  NWHC   has
                       properties  in  Thaba  Nchu  that,  under   the   new
                       demarcation, fall under the jurisdiction of the  Free
                       State. The NWHC want the  land  transferred  back  to
                       them. They need help with negotiations between  North
                       West and the Free  State  over  properties  in  Thabu
                       Nchu.


                  *    Loans taken during the old dispensation  -  the  NWHC
                       requests  that  loans  taken  by  them  in  the   old
                       dispensation be turned  into  grants,  especially  in
                       view of the NWHC not receiving annual grants anymore.


              (e) Department of Housing


                  The  NWHC  suggests  that  if  no  immediate   legislative
                  solution to  the  problem  of  proclamation  R293  can  be
                  found, it seeks the following:


                  *    Co-operation of  the  Department  of  Provincial  and
                       Local Government, the State Attorney and the Surveyor-
                       General to speed  up  the  opening  of  new  township
                       registers.


                  *    Intervention of  the  Department  of  Provincial  and
                       Local Government to  help  municipalities  take  over
                       basic services rendered by the NWHC.


                  *    Guidance of the Department where a  discount  benefit
                       is given to  beneficiaries  while  the  NWHC  has  to
                       service loans and pay interest as well.


                  *    Intervention from Provincial and Local Government  in
                       the matter of rent  collected  by  municipalities  on
                       behalf of the NWHC  but  was  never  paid  over,  for
                       example  R5,7  million  from  Temba,   Mabopane   and
                       Garankuwa alone.


              (f) Social Housing Foundation


                  NWHC requests the Social Housing Foundation to:


                  *    Utilise the NWHC's experience in rental housing


                  *     Form  a  partnership  to  develop   capacity   among
                       municipalities
                  *    Turn some of the NWHC's existing  flats  into  social
                       housing projects and utilise  some  of  the  services
                       stands for the same purpose


                  Arrangements are being made for the  NWHC  to  have  their
                  first meeting with the Foundation.


              (g) National Urban Reconstruction and Housing Agency (NURCHA)


                  The NWHC would like to have  joint  ventures  with  NURCHA
                  for non-subsidy  projects  and  to  have  NURCHA  bridging
                  finance for low-cost projects. Applications are  finalised
                  for low-cost projects and one affordable  housing  project
                  for the  short  term,  while  another  affordable  housing
                  project is planned for the medium term.


              (h) National Housing Finance Corporation (NHFC)
                  The NHFC is  unfortunately  not  operating  in  the  North
                  West.


                  *     The  NWHC  approached  the   NHFC   for   short-term
                       financing of R10 million for operational expenses


                  *    The NWHC needs to turn existing  instalment  purchase
                       agreements into loans and sell them to the NHFC


                  *    The NWHC needs to form a joint  venture  with  NURCHA
                       to build houses for those on the  waiting  list  with
                       end-user finance and loans sold to the NHFC.


     D.  Meeting with Stinkwater Municipality


         The delegation met with the Mayor, the Council,  ward  councillors,
         the developer and members  of  the  community.  The  local  council
         informed the delegation that members of the ward committee was  not
         informed of the delegation's visit. They are  happy  with  the  top
         structure but are struggling to get clean water. The  water  supply
         is low and the capacity of the local dam is not great.


         The developer, Megacom Housing, briefed the Committee:


         1Â 267  houses  have  been  completed  and   are   ready   for   the
         beneficiaries to sign their happy letters. 1Â 307  units  have  been
         roofed but are not yet occupied. 1Â 348 units  (up  to  wall  paper,
         not roofed yet) have been built thus far. The  type  of  foundation
         built is approved by engineers before it can be built,  and  blocks
         used were approved by the CSIR. Local people were employed  in  the
         project and there are about 904 workers on site, 610  men  and  294
         women. Funds were not made available for  a  water-borne  sewerage.
         People  fetch  water  from  water  taps,  200m  away   from   their
         households.


     E.  Stinkwater rural housing project


         1.  Background


              Stinkwater township is situated on the remainder portion 6  of
              the farm Stinkwater, 15 km from Hammanskraal. It  is  adjacent
              to Dilopye (to the west) and on the  road  between  Temba  and
              Soshanguve. The contract for the development to  commence  was
              signed in May 2000. The project to build 200 units was started
              in May 2002, and the project is developer-driven.


         2.  Stakeholders involved


              The Stinkwater local development forum community-based partner
              Megacom Housing - developer
              The district council
              The RDP standing committee


              The main objective of the agreement was  to  provide  low-cost
              housing -  a  type  of  individual  house  acceptable  to  the
              community. The services level comprised graded roads.


         3.  Project execution


              The portion of  land  that  the  project  was  built  on,  was
              transferred from the national government to the North West  so
              that each  site  could  be  registered  in  the  name  of  the
              beneficiary. CMIP funding was also approved for the  provision
              of bulk water. Construction of internal  infrastructure  began
              in October 2000 and was completed in July 2001.


         4.  Project profile


              Internal services comprise a water tap in  each  yard,  a  pit
              toilet and graded roads. The units are 40m2  and  the  project
              value is R36 800. By the end of May 2002,  water  construction
              for  the  area  will  be  completed,  as  it  is   now   under
              construction. The houses consist of  three  rooms  with  three
              windows,  plastered  inside  and  outside  and  also   painted
              externally in a variety of colours. The blocks for the project
              are manufactured on site, thus  increasing  opportunities  for
              local labour and transporters. Sand was transported  by  local
              people and blocks were manufactured locally. The houses do not
              have bathrooms.


              Local-based labour  was  used  by  the  developer  to  promote
              training and skills transfer and to ensure  maximum  community
              involvement. The project created employment opportunities  for
              about 1Â 045 people, which included 189 women, 452 men and  404
              youths (under 30 years).


              The project is not yet complete. 1Â 307 units have been  roofed
              but not yet occupied. 1Â 267  units  have  been  completed  and
              ready for the beneficiaries to sign happy letters.


         5.  Problems experienced


              (a) Some women cannot access houses and some are  not  allowed
                  to  sign  happy  letters.  According   to   one   of   the
                  beneficiaries, it is only their husbands who  are  allowed
                  to sign the happy letters. Her husband is  not  interested
                  to stay in the house and she  is  worried  that  when  the
                  title deed is given to the beneficiary, her  husband  will
                  refuse to hand it over to her.


              (b) The municipality is not actively involved in Stinkwater.


              (c) Water supply is in demand in the area  and  the  community
                  has some difficulty in accessing water,  as  the  capacity
                  of the local dam is low. The community  has  been  without
                  water for three weeks. The matter has been taken  up  with
                  the Department of Water Affairs.


              (d) The approval of the project was delayed - the  application
                  for the project was submitted in 1996 and the project  was
                  approved in 1999.


              (e) Developers are accused of  not  empowering  subcontractors
                  and only allowing them to do painting and installation  of
                  window-panes. They employed local brick layers  and  local
                  people as labourers.


              (f) Local and provincial governments were not allowed to solve
                  the problems experienced with the developer.


              The provincial housing committee will revisit the area to meet
              the local people  and  the  developer,  Megacom  Housing.  The
              purpose of the visit will be to  find  out  exactly  what  the
              problems of the community are.


         6.  Recommendations


              (a) The  Department  of  Water  Affairs  should  expedite  the
                  provision of water to the community.


              (b) Contracts signed by developers should stipulate that  they
                  should fully empower local contractors.


              (c) The Department should see to it that the  municipality  is
                  actively involved  in  matters  affecting  the  Stinkwater
                  community.


     F.  Mabopane Unit U


         1.  Project profile


              This project is located in Mapobane and is referred to as Unit
              U. It is situated North of the Morula Sun and is  adjacent  to
              the Sand River. This project consists of 1Â 411  housing  units
              to the value of R259Â 624 000 and is developer-driven. To  date
              R231Â 537 35,50 has been paid over. The houses are 30m2  (on  a
              minimum size of 250m2). The houses  have  a  bathroom  with  a
              basin and toilet and one big room used as  a  bedroom,  and  a
              lounge and kitchen. Provision has been  made  for  a  bathtub.
              Eskom is installing meters for electricity  and  local  people
              are trained and were employed to assist with the installation.
              The developers had consulted the community before the  project
              was started.


              Each house has full water-borne sewerage and a water tap.  All
              internal roads have been graded  and  a  tarred  bus  road  is
              provided. Construction of the units commenced in May 2001  and
              the project was  completed  in  November  2001.  Training  was
              provided for the local people employed in the project, and  as
              such skills were transferred to them.


         2.  Stakeholders involved


              The project was successfully run  by  community  members,  the
              municipality, SANCO and the developer, Homes 2000.


         3.  Problems experienced


              (a) Some of the houses  have  structural  defects.  There  are
                  cracks in the walls even though they were recently built.


              (b) Some subcontractors approached the developer but only  one
                  was employed; the local people  employed  in  the  project
                  were underpaid.


              (c) There are school children who own houses and  who  do  not
                  qualify for  subsidies.  Of  the  1Â 411  houses,  200  are
                  occupied illegally.


              (d) Some of the houses are used for business purposes.


              (e) Some of the houses are built along the  river  banks.  The
                  MEC promised to look at the matter and to ensure  that  it
                  does not happen again.


         4.  Recommendations


              (a) The Department should ensure that Homes  2000  repair  the
                  cracks in the walls, caused by poor workmanship  on  their
                  part.


                  The Department should see to it that houses are  properly
                  allocated and are occupied by the people who  qualify  for
                  them. It should ensure that these  houses  are  used  only
                  for residential purposes and not for business purposes.


              (c) The Department should investigate whether there are houses
                  that are built below the flood line,  and  if  there  are,
                  the occupants should be relocated elsewhere.
     G.  Garankuwa view


         1.  Project profile


              This project is situated north of Garankuwa's industrial area.
              It consists of 3Â 249 units to the value of R597  816  000.  To
              date R404 313 93,33 has been paid for the project. The  houses
              are 30m2 in size (on a minimum stand  size  of  250m2).  These
              houses have one room and a bathroom.  Each  house  has  water-
              borne  sewerage  and  one  water  tap  is  installed  outside.
              Electricity has not been installed.


              All internal roads have been graded and a tarred bus  road  is
              provided. Construction of the units commenced  in  April  2001
              and the project was completed in November  2001.  The  project
              has been successfully run by  the  steering  committee,  which
              consisted of the municipality, Homes  2002  and  the  CBP.  In
              phase 2 of  the  project,  935  houses  will  be  built.  Land
              identified for the project was an  industrial  area,  and  the
              developer is waiting for the municipality to allocate land for
              the project.


         2.  Problems experienced


              (a) It is very inconveniencing  for  beneficiaries  to  access
                  water from the water tap outside.


              (b) There is no privacy in the house, as  there  is  only  one
                  room where the whole family sleeps.


              (c) It is very dark in the road at  night,  as  there  are  no
                  streetlights.


              (d) School children have to walk about 15 km  to  the  nearest
                  primary school.


              The developer is going to donate the show house to be used  as
              a clinic. Trees were also donated by the developer.


         3.  Recommendations


              (a) Provision should be made for a  school  bus  to  transport
                  pupils until a school is built in the area.


              (b) The Department should in  future  ensure  that  developers
                  build houses according to set norms and standards.


              (c) Streetlights should be installed as matter of urgency,  as
                  the area is prone to crime.


     H.  Meeting with SA Homeless People's Federation


         The delegation met with councillors and members of the SA  Homeless
         People's Federation (SAHPF). The SAHPF briefed  the  delegation  as
         follows:


         Most people in the  area  do  not  earn  enough  to  support  their
         families. Some are pensioners who have to support  their  families.
         The People's  Dialogue/Federation's  approach  to  savings  differs
         fundamentally from the conventional type of savings. The SAHPF  has
         moved away from set monthly savings and loan  repayments  required.
         Instead, there  are  treasures  that  are  trained  to  make  daily
         collections of loan repayments. These daily collections can be  any
         amount. Some people started saving as little as 20  cents,  because
         some people  are  unemployed  and  are  involved  in  the  informal
         sector. As soon as people have saved enough, they  are  grouped  in
         numbers of 10 and allowed to access Utshani Fund. Utshani  Fund  is
         a fund that provides  low-cost  finance  directly  to  the  savings
         groups affiliated to the SAHPF.


         The size of the houses built in Oukasie range between 56 and  72m2.
         The houses are built of cement  blocks  and  cost  about  R10  000.
         Building costs are reduced  by  using  voluntary  unskilled  labour
         from families that  are  building,  buying  material  collectively,
         negotiating low prices with local builders for the skills that  are
         needed, eliminating the profit  in  contractor  building,  re-using
         existing building material and  manufacturing  their  own  building
         blocks. This enables the community to extend their houses.


     I.  Oukasie People's Housing Process


         1.  Background to project


              Oukasie was owned by a farmer and was not  rezoned  for  human
              settlement. The  application  to  develop  the  570  sites  in
              Oukasie was submitted by the SAHPF. The project was  initially
              approved for 300 subsidies and was subsequently  increased  to
              570 as a result of the increase  in  demand  for  houses.  The
              community of Oukasie started saving for their houses  from  as
              little as 20 cents daily. Some of  the  people  are  poor  and
              others are pensioners who have to support their  families.  As
              poor people they met to find ways  of  assisting  each  other.
              Those who have been saving were allowed to access uTshani Fund
              and were shown model houses before their houses are  built  so
              that they understand exactly what their houses will be like.


         2.  Project profile


              The total value of the project is R4 845 000, and R263 500 has
              been paid. About 80 houses have been completed and handed over
              to beneficiaries. They vary in design and  size  -  there  are
              four-roomed, five-and-a-half-roomed and two-roomed houses. The
              sizes are between 56m2 and 72m2. The houses have big  windows,
              electricity, ventilation, and the  bricks  used  are  of  good
              quality. Material to build the houses is  also  obtained  from
              shacks that the beneficiaries were occupying  previously.  The
              cost  of  a  69m2  five-roomed  house  built  by  one  Patrick
              Matsimela was R12 000, and old material from an old shack  was
              used to build the house. In respect of each  house,  it  takes
              two weeks to build the foundation, two to three days to  build
              the top structure, and another two days to put up the roof.
         3.  Problems experienced


              (a) There were delays in the processing  of  the  transfer  of
                  land and this has resulted in the Department  refusing  to
                  release subsidies hence only 80 houses  were  built.  Most
                  people  are  now  waiting  for  their  subsidies   to   be
                  approved. According to the SAHPF developers  were  granted
                  land yet they are refused access to land.


              (b) It is difficult to acquire title deeds and this results in
                  subsidies  not  being  released  by  the  Department.  The
                  People's  Dialogue   has   been   negotiating   with   the
                  Municipality for three  years  and  the  Municipality  has
                  promised to process the applications for title deeds.


              (c) Some people have built houses even though they do not have
                  title deeds. SAPHF is proposing that they be  issued  with
                  title deeds.
         4.  Recommendations


              (a) The Department of Housing should expedite the  issuing  of
                  title deeds to the  community,  especially  to  those  who
                  have already built their  houses.  The  issuing  of  title
                  deeds will enable the community to access subsidies.


         5.  Comments


              The delegation  was  impressed  with  the  commitment  of  the
              community to own their own houses, the size and design of  the
              houses and the  quality  of  building  material  used  in  the
              Oukasie People's Housing Process. From  the  observation  that
              was made by the delegation, it is obvious  that  the  People's
              Housing Process is the way to go.


     J.  Meeting with Klerksdorp City Council


         The delegation  met  with  the  Council  and  was  briefed  by  the
         Executive Mayor, who gave an overview of the  challenges  faced  by
         the municipality.


         The Council has developed  a  strategic  document  in  response  to
         challenges facing the municipality, and is working hard  to  ensure
         that  these  challenges  are  met.   The   first   social   housing
         association will be set up before the end of June 2002. The  social
         housing foundation is supporting the municipality. Since  1994,  26
         housing projects have been built  and  90%  of  the  projects  were
         people-driven. Over 30 000 houses of 42m2 have been  built  in  the
         area.  The  municipality  has  prioritised  the  People's   Housing
         Process, as development has to be people-driven to  succeed.  Since
         2002, no projects have been approved. The Council wants  to  ensure
         that the projects create jobs and are labour-intensive.


         1.  Problems experienced


              (a) The manner in which the steering  committee  at  municipal
                  level was set up, created  problems.  That  committee  was
                  not trained to carry out its mandate and they do not  know
                  where  their  responsibility  starts  or  ends.   It   was
                  explained to them that they should give way  to  the  ward
                  committee members.


              (b) Most  of  the  projects  that  are  developer-driven,  are
                  incomplete. Some of the projects that were  paid  for  are
                  not yet constructed - there are no  structures  in  place.
                  The Mayor is aware of the problem and  will  be  assisting
                  in rectifying it.


              (c) Women empowerment and poverty  alleviation  have  not  yet
                  been achieved.  With  regard  to  black  empowerment,  the
                  municipality is doing well and has received the  Mpumelelo
                  award.


              (d) Building  material  in  some  cases  is  dumped  with  the
                  beneficiaries,  and  these  beneficiaries  are  forced  by
                  developers  and  contractors  to  sign  happy  letters  in
                  respect of houses  that  have  not  yet  been  built.  The
                  developers have been cautioned not to continue  with  this
                  activity.


              (e) There are serious backlogs  in  the  delivery  of  houses.
                  8Â 000 people are on the waiting  list  for  stands  to  be
                  allocated to them.


              (f) Most communities are still using the bucket system and  it
                  is going  to  take  a  long  time  before  the  system  is
                  improved.


              (g) Some beneficiaries have disappeared and it is difficult to
                  trace them.


              (h) Other allegations include the exploitation of historically
                  disadvantaged communities and contractors in the  name  of
                  black empowerment.


         2.  Recommendations
              (a) The Department should address the  bucket  system  problem
                  and should ensure that programmes to  replace  the  bucket
                  system with adequate sanitation are put in place.


              (b) The municipality should speed up the process  of  ensuring
                  that houses left vacant by beneficiaries are occupied.


              (c) Developers engaged in illegal activities should be brought
                  to book.


              (d) The housing backlog should be addressed  as  a  matter  of
                  urgency.


              (e) Proper training in building skills should be provided  for
                  women.


     K.  Kanana Hostel


         1.  Project profile


              R1,4 million was approved for the renovation of  the  project.
              Renovations were started in 2000 and are still not  completed.
              There are about 800 residents in the hostel, some of whom used
              to work in the mines, most of which have been closed down. The
              Council does not have the records  of  people  who  should  be
              staying in the hostel, and  residents  stay  free  of  charge.
              There are only three water taps in the whole hostel. According
              to the councillor in  the  area,  99%  of  the  residents  are
              unemployed; some are from Lesotho and Mozambique  and  do  not
              possess South African identification documents. This makes  it
              difficult for them to get employment.


         2.  Problems experienced


              (a) Delays in the awarding of tenders - Roofguard was  awarded
                  the  contract  to  renovate   the   hostel.   Kanana-based
                  building contractors demanded to be awarded the  contract.
                  On 21 July  199,  the  Council  agreed  that  40%  of  the
                  contract be awarded  to  local  contractors.  Construction
                  commenced on 30 March 2000, but due  to  poor  performance
                  by Roofguard the Council adopted a  resolution  to  cancel
                  their  contract.  L  Construction   and   Ncedanani   were
                  appointed to complete the work started by Roofguard.


              (b) Vandalism and theft - building  contractors  were  assured
                  that units would  be  vacated  during  construction  work.
                  This arrangement never materialised and some R25  000  was
                  lost as a result of vandalism and theft on site.


              (c)  Delays  in   construction   -   significant   delays   in
                  construction work were experienced  as  a  result  of  the
                  presence  of  occupants  in  the  hostel  building  during
                  construction.


              (d) Poor payment of subcontractors by main contractors -  this
                  resulted in disputes and work stoppages.


              (e) Lack of sanitation - there are no toilets in the hostel. A
                  bucket system was previously used but  now  there  are  no
                  buckets,  as  they  are  continuously  being  stolen.  The
                  Council did not set aside funds for sanitation  and  water
                  supply when they budgeted for renovation of the hostel.


              (f) There is a high rate of illnesses in the hostel - some  of
                  the residents suffer  from  TB  and  sexually  transmitted
                  diseases.


              The Klerksdorp Municipality inherited this  problem  from  the
              Orkney Municipality.


              According to the MEC, the Klerksdorp Municipality received  R7
              million, but only utilised R1 million. The project  to  remove
              the bucket system is under way,  but  the  municipalities  are
              fighting about who  should  be  awarded  the  tender  for  the
              projects. The Department tried to assist the Council, but  the
              Council was unable to carry out its  responsibilities  because
              most of the projects were implemented during the  transitional
              period when they the municipalities were  not  yet  in  power.
              Funds will be made available for the improvement of the Kanana
              hostel.


         3. Recommendation


              The Council needs to urgently improve the living conditions in
              the hostel and should also implement proper control of  access
              to the hostel.


     L.  Khuma Extension 2 & 3 - Stilfontein Housing Project


         1.  Project profile


              The project is situated near Orkney and  the  stands  are  all
              serviced with essential infrastructure. The entire project has
              477 units to the value of R8Â 228Â 250. To date  R7  412  131,50
              has been paid in respect of this  project.  Local  people  and
              local subcontractors were employed to build the top structure.
              The size of the units is 40m2,  and  7Â 000  houses  have  been
              built. The houses have waterborne sewerage and water taps.


         2.  Problems experienced


              Some of the houses are vandalised; 150 houses  are  unoccupied
              (without beneficiaries). 10% of the beneficiaries have  passed
              away and some people are illegally occupying their houses.


         3.  Recommendation


              People  on  the  waiting  list  should  be  allocated  to  the
              unoccupied houses and the illegally occupied houses.


     M.  Blydeville - Lichtenburg


         1.  Project profile


              The value of the project is R34  586  250  and  it  has  2Â 005
              units. R29 530 951,55 has been paid in respect of the project.
              The land where the project is situated, is a  portion  of  the
              remainder of portion 1 of Farm Rietdraai 51 -  1P.  Blydeville
              is located to the  south  of  Lichtenburg  and  was  a  former
              "coloured" township. With the exception of a  few  businesses,
              Blydeville is primarily a residential area.


              The Lichtenburg Municipality provides water and sanitation  to
              the beneficiaries at no cost. The  services  provided  include
              graded gravel roads, electricity, water  and  sanitation.  The
              land was made available by the municipality at no cost at all.
              The size of the houses is  32m2  and  the  stand  sizes  range
              between 250m2 and 450m2.  The  houses  have  one  room  and  a
              kitchen and are electrified. The Council is the developer  and
              the  Department  of  Local  Government  and  Housing  is   the
              subcontractor. Each house has waterborne sewage  and  a  water
              tap, the bathroom has a toilet and a basin, but  there  is  no
              shower.


         2.  Problems experienced


              Some beneficiaries cannot afford to pay electricity and  as  a
              result electricity  supply  to  them  has  been  disconnected.
              Electricity supplied is not prepaid.


         3.  Recommendations


              (a) The Department should  assist  in  ensuring  that  prepaid
                  electricity meters are  installed  in  all  households  to
                  avoid non-payment of electricity accounts.
              (b) The  Department  together  with  the  municipality  should
                  establish whether the  construction  method  used  in  the
                  project is favourable for the units to be extended.


              (c) As there is plenty of space for a shower in the  bathroom,
                  it is suggested that these should be installed.


     N.  Mathatheng Flood Reconstruction Rural Housing Project by Women


         1.  Background to project


              In 2000, Mathatheng and other neighbouring areas within  North
              West experienced  torrential  rainfalls,  which  left  a  huge
              number of people without homes. The government was  not  aware
              of the plight of the Mathatheng community.  It  was  the  SABC
              that brought this to the eyes of the government by producing a
              documentary  on  the  community.  The  Department   of   Local
              Government and Housing responded to this call by approving for
              an amount of R10,6 million to be allocated for  reconstruction
              in this area. R288 000 was allocated to 18  beneficiaries  and
              each received a relief fund amount of R16Â 000. There are about
              400 people living in the community of Mathatheng.


         2.  Implementation process


              Thaba  housing   support   organisation   was   appointed   by
              beneficiaries to render the following support services:


              (a) Capacitate beneficiaries in all aspects of housing.


              (b) Empower them through skills transfer.


              (c) Support and strengthen their capabilities  throughout  the
                  reconstruction process.


              (d)  Offer  training  in  respect   of   indigenous   building
                  technology.


              (e) Train them in project management.


              (f) Assist them in the establishment of  the  housing  support
                  centre.


              The project was implemented in  terms  of  the  Rural  Housing
              Programme and the People's Housing Process.


         3.  Specifications - norms and standards


              The norms and standards were designed and put in place by  the
              Department, the Thaba housing  support  organisation  and  the
              beneficiaries. Structures not less than 45m2 ion  extent  were
              constructed by the beneficiaries themselves through the above-
              mentioned acquired skills. Toilets are  outside  and  are  pit
              toilets. Prepaid metres for electricity have  been  installed.
              The houses have different designs  and  the  number  of  rooms
              differs from house to house.


              Although 18 houses have been rebuilt, there  is  need  for  an
              integrated and sustainable rural  development  strategy.  With
              the skills  acquired,  beneficiaries  have  the  potential  to
              undertake  any  housing  development  process.  The  MEC   has
              approved the building of an additional 250 houses.


         4.  Problems experienced


              (a) Schoolchildren have to walk a long distance to the nearest
                  school. There are no clinics or shops in the area and  one
                  has to walk long distances for medical assistance and  for
                  buying groceries. The Council is struggling  to  obtain  a
                  mobile clinic.


              (b) There are no water taps in  the  area  and  the  community
                  accesses water from bore holes.
              (c)  The  community  is  skeptical  of  the  People's  Housing
                  Process. When it was launched, the  community  thought  it
                  was one of those schemes where people are  conned  out  of
                  their money.


         5.  Recommendations


              (a) The Department of Transport needs to assist  by  providing
                  the children with a school bus until a school is built  in
                  the area.


              (b) The Department of Water Affairs should assist in  ensuring
                  that water is made available for the community.


              (c) The Department of Health is urged to come to the rescue of
                  the community by ensuring that at least  a  mobile  clinic
                  is provided in the meantime.


              (d)  The  People's  Housing  Process  programme  needs  to  be
                  launched so that people can be informed  of  what  exactly
                  it entails.


              Redevelopment of the houses in  Mathatheng  has  brought  back
              dignity to the beneficiaries whose houses had been destroyed.


     O.  North West Provincial Housing Policy Update Workshop


         The delegation briefly attended a workshop session  on  the  policy
         update. The workshop was organised  by  the  provincial  Department
         and was attended  by  approximately  200  delegates  consisting  of
         porvincial housing stakeholders.  Matters  discussed  included  the
         increase  in  subsidy  amounts  and  a  new   procurement   policy.
         Unfortunately the delegation could not  attend  the  whole  two-day
         session, as it had to leave on the first day.


     P.  Comments
         The North West Department of Housing is fully involved  in  housing
         development. There are many projects currently taking place with  a
         view of tackling the housing challenge and problems experienced  by
         different communities. The MEC is aware of  most  of  the  problems
         that are faced by beneficiaries in  different  communities.  He  is
         committed to addressing them and is  doing  so  in  line  with  the
         policies of the government.


     VI. Conclusion


         It is obvious that much has been achieved, but there is still  more
         that needs to be done to ensure that inhabitants  of  this  country
         are housed. The structure, vision, policies  and  legislation  that
         are now in place, create the platform  from  which  to  effectively
         move forward.


         Collective efforts are needed to  establish  a  productive  climate
         that will remove the  plight  of  the  homeless.  The  creation  of
         partnerships  between  the  various  spheres  of  government,   the
         private sector and the communities  is  fundamental  for  sustained
         delivery of housing. It assists in ensuring that different  parties
         accept their responsibilities and work together  in  unity  with  a
         common purpose.  By  meeting  the  housing  challenge,  the  social
         structures of this country will be rebuilt, thus  regenerating  the
         economy and integrating communities. These  integrated  communities
         should be  situated  in  areas  that  allow  convenient  access  to
         economic  opportunities  and   health,   educational   and   social
         amenities.

4.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and  Local  Government
     on Study Tour of Spain, dated 20 June 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on  Provincial  and  Local  Government,  having
     undertaken an intergovernmental relations study tour of Spain,  reports
     as follows:


     A.  Introduction


         1.  With the finalisation of the new  system  of  local  government
              (but for outstanding issues of local government finances), the
              Ministry and Department of Provincial and Local Government are
              beginning to increasingly focus on developing  our  system  of
              intergovernmental relations (IGR) and co-operative  governance
              in order to improve delivery and development. This is going to
              be a major pre-occupation of the Ministry and Department  over
              the next few years.


         2. In terms of section 41(2) of the Constitution,  legislation  has
              to be passed to:


              "(a)     establish or provide for structures and  institutions
                    to promote and facilitate  intergovernmental  relations;
                    and


              (b) provide  for  appropriate  mechanisms  and  procedures  to
                    facilitate settlement of intergovernmental disputes."


         3. The Department has for some  time  now  been  pre-occupied  with
              these matters  -  it  has  commissioned  reports,  sent  staff
              abroad, engaged with experts, and commenced an internal policy
              formulation process.


         4.  The Department intends  to  introduce  initial  legislation  in
              terms of Section 41 of the Constitution either late this  year
              or early next year.


         5.  In order to equip the Portfolio Committee more  effectively  to
              participate  in  the  process  of  developing   policies   and
              legislation on IGR, the Portfolio Committee undertook  an  IGR
              study tour of Spain from 7 to 14 December 2001.


         6.  Spain was specifically chosen because there  are  a  number  of
              features of the Spanish system of government that  are  either
              similar to those obtaining in SA, or which have a  bearing  on
              possible future developments here. These include:


              (a) The history of centralised or  autocratic  government  and
                  recent turn to democracy.


              (b) The relative newness of the national constitution.


              (c) The constitutional recognition of at least three tiers  of
                  government.


              (d) The presence of strong regional identities.


              (e) The  existence  of  a  diverse  set  of  intergovernmental
                  relations mechanisms and structures.


              (f) The existence of a body similar to  our  intergovernmental
                  bodies.


              (g) The internationally unique  intergovernmental  concept  of
                  "asymmetrical devolution".


         7.   Those  who  participated  in  the  tour  were:  Mr  Y   Carrim
              (Chairperson, ANC), Mr J Kgarimetsa (ANC), Rev A Goosen (ANC),
              Ms C Lobe (ANC), Ms G Borman (DP), Mr  P  Smith  (IFP),  Ms  R
              Southgate (ACDP) and Mr C Sibanyoni (Researcher).


         8. The central government and the regions  (provinces)  of  Madrid,
              Andalusia, the Basque  Country  and  Catalonia  were  visited.
              These  included  visits  to  Madrid,  Seville,   Vitoria   and
              Barcelona.  Meetings  were  held  with   a   wide   range   of
              stakeholders,     including     national     and      regional
              parliamentarians,  local  government  councillors,  government
              officials, academics  and  representatives  from  the  Spanish
              Federation of Municipalities and Provinces.


         9. The study tour was very helpful  and  valuable.  It  might  have
              been useful to also have visited a relevant developing country
              to examine its IGR system and draw comparisons.
         10. The study tour was facilitated by the South African embassy  in
              Madrid. The Committee records its appreciation to the  embassy
              and in particular Ms D Viljoen, the political counsellor. Mr C
              Sibanyoni  is  acknowledged  for   his   assistance   in   the
              preparation of this report. The Committee is  also  especially
              grateful to its secretary, Mr L Brown, for the enormous amount
              of work he did to ensure the success of the study tour.


     B.  Background on Spain


         1. Spain has now experienced  some  23  years  of  democracy  after
              almost 40 years of autocratic and strongly centrist rule under
              General Franco. Since the adoption of its new Constitution  in
              1978, Spain has been  acclaimed  for  the  uniqueness  of  its
              constitutional system, premised as it is  not  only  upon  the
              asymmetrical allocation of powers and functions to  the  State
              (central  government)   and   Autonomous   Communities   (ACs)
              (provinces), but equally,  on  the  constitutional  method  by
              which these powers  and  functions  are  allocated.  Variously
              identified   as   asymmetrical   federal   or   asymmetrically
              decentralised,  Spain  is  a  parliamentary   monarchy   whose
              transition  has  been  long  and  complex  but   also   highly
              successful.


         2.  A key political and constitutional  theme  in  Spain  has  been
              that of centrism versus regionalism, and more particularly, of
              centrism versus community autonomy, especially in those  parts
              of the country which have historical, linguistic and  cultural
              claims to being different to the rest of Spain - such  as  the
              Basque Country, Navarre, Catalonia and Galicia - and in  which
              secessionist sentiment exists. The Constitution "is  based  on
              the  indissoluble  unity  of  the  Spanish  nation,  ...   and
              recognises  and  guarantees  the  right  to  autonomy  of  the
              nationalities and regions that make it up, and the  solidarity
              between them" (Article 2).
         3.  During the constitution-making  process  there  were  different
              conceptions on what the political system in Spain  should  be.
              The parties on the right were in favour of a unitary state and
              they asserted that any  concession  to  the  nationalities  of
              Spain posed a threat to national unity.  The  parties  on  the
              left wanted federalism. The nationalists wanted greater  power
              and autonomy for the Basque Country and Catalonia than for the
              other regions. Consequently, the negotiating parties agreed on
              establishing three routes to autonomy. The regions that  voted
              in a referendum in favour of autonomy in the past were allowed
              to follow a relatively fast process towards full autonomy. The
              Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia qualified to follow  the
              fast process.  Andalusia,  however,  followed  an  exceptional
              route towards full autonomy. The reason is  that  it  did  not
              qualify as a historic nationality but had a  majority  support
              for full autonomy. The other 13 ACs  followed  a  5-year  long
              route in order to achieve autonomy.


         4. In its change to democracy and in the  decentralisation  of  its
              system of government, Spain has  been  fortunate  that  socio-
              economic factors have strengthened rather  than  hindered  the
              process. In the first place, Spanish society was at  the  time
              of the 1978 transition, and  remains  today,  a  society  with
              considerable social equality, unlike South  Africa.  Spain  is
              indeed, a welfare state. Moreover, the  post-1978  period  has
              been  characterised  economically  by  significant  stability,
              diversification and growth, reducing the  prospects  of  civil
              unrest  and  increasing  the   legitimacy   of   the   system.
              Notwithstanding the much lower levels of  inequality  compared
              to South Africa, there is strong emphasis placed  on  reducing
              inequality between regions and within regions.  Membership  of
              the European Union (EU) is important in this  regard,  and  it
              was observed on several occasions that in a sense the  Spanish
              system is of four, not three, spheres of  government.  Spain's
              relations with the EU is a major preoccupation.


         5. Interestingly,  the  transition  from  a  centrist  state  to  a
              decentralised one is not quite complete - after over 20  years
              -  and  the  decentralisation  process  in  respect  of  local
              government has barely begun.


     C.  Evolution of IGR in Spain


         1. The drafters of the 1978  Spanish  Constitution  fudged  several
              contentious issues in favour of reaching consensus, leaving  a
              range of matters to be resolved in the future. One consequence
              of this is a division of powers and  functions  reliant  on  a
              process to be  fulfilled  rather  than  a  rigid  and  uniform
              constitutional enumeration of allocated  competences.  Another
              is  that  since  the  ACs  only  came  into  being  after  the
              Constitution was adopted, the Constitution makes no  reference
              to the 17 ACs making up the current territory of Spain.


         2.  But  importantly,  from  an  IGR  perspective,  this  purposive
              constitutional obfuscation resulted in what was  initially  at
              least, a highly litigious system in which the  State  and  ACs
              made extensive use of the  Constitutional  Court,  largely  in
              respect of  defending  their  respective  competences  against
              perceived encroachment. There have been some 800 cases  before
              the Constitutional  Court  over  20  years,  though  the  vast
              majority of these were in the early years of the transition. A
              view commonly expressed was that following the development  of
              a necessarily large  body  of  authoritative  and  politically
              accepted jurisprudence,  the  system  is  currently  far  more
              mature in that both ACs and the State operate in terms  of  an
              established understanding of the limits  of  their  respective
              competences. The result is far less conflict now than  in  the
              past.


         3. Another noteworthy feature is the extent to which  reliance  has
              been  placed  on  mechanisms  and  institutions  not  directly
              created  by  the  Constitution.  Instead,  a  combination   of
              statutory and  non-statutory  bodies  play  key  roles  in  an
              interlocking system in which negotiation plays a major role in
              addressing potential or actual conflict.


         4. As in any multi-sphered system with the same political party  in
              control  at  both  the  national   and   sub-national   level,
              governmental disputes are frequently mediated within the party
              rather than between governments. This  was  accentuated  by  a
              strong   Proportional    Representation    electoral    system
              strengthening the role of the political party  in  respect  of
              its public representatives, though it appeared that  the  left
              of centre parties permitted greater sub-national autonomy  and
              thus deviation from party policy than  did  the  centre  right
              parties.


         5. A key theme was  the  length  of  the  transition.  Stakeholders
              often referred to the fact that the transfer of powers to  the
              ACs and the concomitant finalisation of  structures,  staffing
              and  finances  associated  with  AC  governance  is  only  now
              reaching its  conclusion,  while  those  ACs  wanting  greater
              competences saw the process requiring yet more time  to  reach
              "finality".


         6. Allied to this  23-year  time-frame  has  been  a  single-minded
              focus on completing the first  phase,  AC  governance,  before
              commencing on the so-called "second wave of  decentralisation"
              - to municipalities. This contrasts with South Africa in which
              the transition  is  commonly  conceptualised  as  a  far  more
              condensed process.


     D.  Powers and Functions of Central and Regional States


         1. The Spanish Constitution utilises a unique approach towards  the
              allocation of powers and functions between the State  and  the
              ACs. The focus is more on the constitutional process  than  it
              is about any a priori allocation of competences.  Indeed,  the
              essence of the system is one in which the Constitution  merely
              enumerates which competences an  AC  may  assume  whereas  the
              specific competences actually assumed reflect a constitutional
              negotiations process between the State and a particular AC.


         2. In general, the sequence is as follows: the State and the AC  in
              question reach  broad  agreement  on  the  competences  to  be
              assumed;  the  AC  drafts  its  "Statute   of   Autonomy"   or
              Constitution which is ratified by way of a referendum  and  is
              adopted by its Parliament; the State  Parliament  then  passes
              the statute - with a special  majority  -  as  a  law  of  the
              centre. The Constitution provided for  a  fast-track  approach
              (adopted by the historical communities) and a slower  approach
              (the other ACs). The actual  allocation  of  competences  over
              time reflects these  two  groups  of  ACs,  though  there  are
              differences, sometimes  significant,  within  each  group.  In
              addition to the enumerated functions an AC may assume, it  may
              also, with State agreement, assume competence  over  specified
              issues falling within  the  scope  of  non-allocated  residual
              competences.   The   Constitution   further   guarantees   the
              historical  position  of  specified  communities.   This   for
              instance, is why revenue collection in the Basque  Country  is
              completely different to the rest of the country.


         3. The AC competences are of  three  types:  exclusive,  concurrent
              and shared. Though the Constitution theoretically provides for
              an intervention or override mechanism, it appears  in  reality
              as though exclusive powers permit of no  State  competence  in
              that same field within the  AC  in  question.  The  nature  of
              Spanish concurrence differs from ours.  Whereas  in  our  case
              both national and provincial spheres have full  competence  in
              respect of any particular Schedule  4  functional  area,  this
              overrides being the means of resolving a dispute, in the  case
              of Spain, State competence is limited  to  setting  out  broad
              principles which the ACs are free to give effect  to  as  they
              see fit. Conflict over the extensiveness or otherwise of  what
              is permissible has been addressed by the Constitutional Court,
              in favour of a limited rather than extensive State competence.
              In respect of a shared competence, the AC is obliged to simply
              execute national legislation.  State  competence  is  likewise
              exclusive (enumerated) and  concurrent.  Residual  powers  lie
              with the State except in so far as any  particular  functional
              area has been allocated to an AC by way of agreement.


         4. As far as the classification of the system is  concerned,  there
              appear to be two firm views in Spain: one  group  claimed  the
              country was clearly federal in nature or that it  was  federal
              in all but a few matters, such as the structure of the senate;
              the second group felt the  system  was  simply  decentralised.
              Interestingly, these views tended to correlate with  political
              party affiliation: centre-right centrist parties, such as  the
              Popular Party (PP),  view  the  system  favourably  as  merely
              decentralised  while  socialist  parties   view   the   system
              favourably as federal, stating that Spain was simply incapable
              politically, of recognising this fact.


         5. The Portfolio Committee participants in  the  study  tour  noted
              the particular challenges posed by the specific  circumstances
              of the Basque Country and the role of the ETA  in  particular,
              but does not feel competent to make any  useful  observations,
              except to stress the need for negotiations to solve  political
              conflicts wherever they may exist.


     E.  Local Government


         1. At one level, local government seemingly occupies the same  type
              of constitutional position common to most three-tiered systems
              - it is subordinate to and is a creature of the national or AC
              governments. This is so because  it  derives  its  legislative
              competence from national and AC statutes and is  not  accorded
              original  powers   by   the   Constitution.   Indeed,   "local
              administration" is expressly listed as a competence  that  may
              be assumed by ACs. However, it would be simplistic  to  assume
              from this an exaggerated position of subordination.


         2. First, in  terms  of  human  capacity  and  financial  capacity,
              municipalities  do  not  on  the  whole   appear   to   suffer
              significant capacity constraints. Whilst  it  is  acknowledged
              that there are far too many (about 8,000  mostly  very  small)
              municipalities, the view was  commonly  expressed  that  local
              identity took precedence over the  need  for  rationalisation,
              and  that  despite  this  need,   local   government   worked.
              Certainly, State and AC capacity building did not  feature  in
              our discussions.


         3. Second, while in terms of  national  legislation  municipalities
              are required to provide a minimum set of services according to
              the population of the municipality in question, they appear to
              enjoy considerable freedom in respect of how they give  effect
              to what is a nationally-determined  framework.  For  instance,
              municipalities provide for service  delivery  via  a  host  of
              mechanisms equivalent to those provided for in  Chapter  8  of
              our Local Government: Municipal Systems Act.


         4. Third, the larger municipalities have competences  that  in  our
              country reside with national and provincial governments - such
              as social  services  and  housing.  These  municipalities  are
              seeking  more  competencies.  Many  of  the  service  delivery
              functions preoccupying us are delivered not  directly  by  the
              municipality but by what in Spain is called  a  Province.  The
              Province  is  indirectly  elected  by  municipalities  and  is
              superficially similar to our District. Though acknowledged  as
              a tier of local government,  it  is  not  expressly  termed  a
              municipality. The larger municipalities visited exercised more
              than the minimum competences, having negotiated  the  transfer
              of further powers. A view was  expressed  that  the  ACs  were
              sometimes too remote from local communities and  too  inclined
              to provide services in a manner incongruent with the views  of
              the local community, necessitating that municipalities  expand
              their delivery role.


         5.  Fourth,  there  are  two  constitutional  guarantees   of   key
              significance. On the one hand, the Constitution provides  that
              municipalities must be  guaranteed  the  funding  required  to
              carry out their services; the existence of  unfunded  mandates
              did not appear to be a major issue  in  Spain.  On  the  other
              hand, and most  important,  the  Constitution  guarantees  the
              "autonomy"  of  municipalities.  This  appears  to  be  of  an
              institutional    form    in    particular,    including    its
              administration, and has the effect of reducing  State  and  AC
              intervention in the manner provided for in  our  Constitution.
              The only intervention mechanism available to the State and  AC
              appeared to be the courts. Interestingly, it appears as though
              municipalities cannot be compelled to accept new  competences,
              even if funded, but have the  discretion  to  accept  or  deny
              them.


         6. A recurrent issue raised  was  that  with  the  first  phase  of
              centralisation now almost over, from State  to  AC,  Spain  is
              shortly to commence the next phase  in  the  process,  of  the
              transfer  of  further   competences   to   local   government.
              Constitutionally,  this  is  not  a  solely   State-determined
              process, but requires AC co-operation. Although various  State
              stakeholders saw AC resistance to having to hand over some  of
              its competences as a serious impediment to the success of  the
              process, a number of AC representatives viewed the process  as
              inevitable and desirable.  Municipalities  have  achieved  low
              levels of development. For  historical  reasons  priority  was
              given to ACs rather than to local government. Local government
              wants more powers but the progress is very slow. The  ACs  are
              reluctant to devolve some of their powers  to  municipalities.
              To address this, the Socialist Party  and  the  Popular  Party
              have signed an agreement 4 years  ago  to  devolve  powers  to
              municipalities. All stakeholders recognised that  the  process
              will take a long time and will require extensive negotiations.


         7.  There is a Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in  Spain
              that unites local government. Of about 8  000  municipalities,
              about 6 000 belong to the Federation of Municipalities. The  6
              000 or so municipalities account for 94% of the population  of
              Spain. Out of 50 provinces in Spain, 49  are  members  of  the
              Federation of Municipalities. The existence of the  Federation
              of Municipalities is not recognised in the Constitution -  but
              the central government does engage with it. The Federation  of
              Municipalities has been promoting the devolution of power  and
              expenditure to local government - but is  not  satisfied  with
              progress so far.


     F.  Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations


         1.  ACs  are  not  only  guaranteed  political  autonomy   by   the
              Constitution,  but  also  financial  autonomy:  Article  156.1
              provides that "the Autonomous Communities will enjoy financial
              autonomy  for  the  development   and   execution   of   their
              competences ...".


         2.  The  Spanish  system  is   complex.   Since   the   "historical
              communities" had their historical  rights  guaranteed  by  the
              Constitution, this has resulted in a measure of asymmetry.  On
              the one extreme, and unique to the relatively  wealthy  Basque
              Country, almost all taxes including income  tax,  Value  Added
              Tax (VAT) and excise duty are collected by the AC  which  then
              pays over to the State its agreed share.  The  State  collects
              none of these itself. The share paid by the AC to the State is
              intended to reflect the cost of state services provided in the
              Basque Country as well as a  pro  rata  share  of  other  non-
              territory-based State expenditure such as foreign affairs  and
              defence. It also includes a "solidarity" component - funds  to
              be apportioned to the poorer ACs as part of the State's inter-
              AC financial equalisation efforts.  Typically,  costing  these
              State services is a complex, lengthy and contentious  process,
              entailing considerable  negotiations.  The  Basque  government
              emphasised that it, rather than the State, carried  the  risk,
              since the sum to be paid to the State was  fixed  irrespective
              of  actual  revenue   collection   and   underlying   economic
              performance. Importantly, agreement reached between the Basque
              Country and the State is enshrined in a freshly-negotiated and
              updated "Economic  Agreement",  enjoying  high  political  and
              contractual status,  equivalent  indeed,  to  its  Statute  of
              Autonomy.


         3. Other historical communities such  as  Catalonia  are  likewise,
              though not as extensively, differentiated from what is  called
              the common tax regime system to be found elsewhere in Spain.


         4. In terms of the common system, there are  three  groups  of  tax
              resources to be divided between the State and  the  AC.  First
              are the "financial  sufficiency"  finances.  This  is  revenue
              provided by the State from tax revenues intended to cover  the
              cost of transferred functions. From specific  taxes  collected
              by the State in the territory of the AC, and especially income
              tax and VAT a percentage of each is apportioned to the AC  for
              this purpose, to which  is  added  "own-taxes"  collected  and
              managed by the AC. Costing of services transferred and thus of
              revenue transferred is not zero-based or  need-based,  but  is
              based on the  cost  at  the  time  of  transfer  adjusted  for
              necessary increases. Moreover, should  there  be  a  shortfall
              between the cost of  the  services  rendered  and  the  fiscal
              capacity of the AC, the Financial and Fiscal Board comes  into
              play to facilitate the transfer of further  funding  from  the
              State.


         5. The second group covers self-government,  and  is  sourced  from
              specific AC taxes. The application and extent of  this  taxing
              power is limited by a number of factors such  as  EU  rulings,
              State prescripts regarding  market  unity  and  macro-economic
              stability, and the like.


         6. The third group is centred on so-called  "solidarity",  being  a
              geographical,  basically  AC,  compensation  fund  or  minimum
              balancing or equalisation fund aimed at equalising the quality
              of  services  for  all  Spaniards  regardless  of   residence,
              especially in respect of education and health.


         7. The allocations take place in terms of a "Quota  Law"  providing
              for a formula-based  quota,  negotiated  for  5-year  periods.
              There are currently attempts being made to  make  the  formula
              permanent. Interestingly, Spain has reverted  to  the  present
              system of AC entitlement to individual  taxes  raised  by  the
              State after experimenting with and rejecting a pooling system.


         8. For the ACs in the common system, transfers from the  State  are
              thus critical, since "own" revenue is limited between 12%  and
              15% of revenue, EU transfers excluded. In most instances these
              transfers are unconditional.


         9.  Local  government  raises  some  60%  of  its  own  revenue  on
              aggregate, the balance comprising State transfers via the ACs.
              The level of financial autonomy is less than that of the ACs.


         10. EU transfers  have  been  extremely  important  in  respect  of
              promoting development  in  the  poorer  ACs.  The  quantum  of
              transfers is based on the extent of AC deviation from  an  EU-
              determined standard of living  norm,  and  is  of  two  types:
              infrastructural grants (especially  transport),  and  specific
              programmes (such as job creation). Among the key EU funds  are
              the European Regional Development Fund, European  Agricultural
              Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and European Social Fund.


         11.     Intervention measures by the State  in  respect  of  AC  or
              municipal mismanagement is  virtually  non-existent,  and  the
              State is thus reliant on the courts to secure compliance.


     G.  Institutions and Mechanisms of IGR


         1. Typically, the Constitution of Spain does not expressly  provide
              for the full range of IGR institutions and processes  utilised
              by IGR roleplayers. Some of the  more  important  institutions
              are referred to below.


         2.  Senate: According to the Constitution,  the  Senate  represents
              the interests of  the  ACs.  In  practice  it  does  not.  But
              political parties are trying to address  this.  The  Socialist
              Party wants the Senate to play a role  in  mediating  conflict
              between central government and the ACs. To achieve  this,  the
              Socialist Party wants the Constitution to be amended. However,
              the Popular Party does not want to  change  the  Constitution.
              According to the Popular Party, it is better not to change the
              Constitution.


         3. Council for Fiscal and Financial  Policy:  There  is  a  special
              Council for Fiscal  and  Financial  Policy,  composed  of  the
              Minister of economics and finance from the central government,
              and his or her counterpart in each region and the Minister  of
              Public Administration. The Ministry of  Public  Administration
              is directly charged with overall intergovernmental  relations,
              co-operation, and capacity-development, but in  practice  this
              is shared with many functional ministries.  This  consultative
              body provides an intergovernmental forum for debate. The  body
              is also concerned with the co-ordination of  policy  regarding
              the distribution of state resources to the regions, as well as
              public investment, the costs of services and public debt.


         4.  Multi-sectoral  Conferences:  There  are  sectoral  conferences
              similar to MinMecs.


         5. Bilateral Commission: There are also bilateral meetings  between
              central government and some of the ACs.


         6.  Political  Party  System:  Political  parties   contribute   to
              stabilising IGR by mediating differences between ACs  and  the
              center and between ACs through party political structures.


         7. It would seem that there is no forum which  bring  together  all
              tiers of government on a regular and organised basis.


     H.  The European Union


         Currently, there is a debate regarding  the  participation  of  the
         ACs in the European Union (EU). Some ACs want to be represented  in
         the EU institutions. For example, the Basque  Country  argues  that
         since it basically has its own  fiscal  system  it  should  have  a
         chance to defend itself in the EU. However, the central  government
         argues that the EU is a union of states.  In  addition,  the  State
         asserts that foreign relations is a non-transferable competence  of
         the Central Government.  EU  policy  falls  under  foreign  policy.
         However,  a  counter  argument  is  that  the  process  of  the  EU
         integration is not, in any way, a foreign relations issue, for  the
         central government is giving its powers and those  of  the  ACs  to
         the EU. The ACs,  for  example,  have  competences  in  respect  of
         agriculture. But decisions and policies on agriculture are made  at
         Brussels. Thus, the EU impinges on ACs competences.


     I.  Conflict Resolution


         1.  The  Constitutional  Court  plays  a  vital  role  in  conflict
              resolution. This is more so, because the Spanish  Constitution
              is unfinished. When the Constitution was drafted it  was  left
              flexible and some of  the  clauses  are  vague.  This  created
              particular challenges. In the 1980s many cases were  taken  to
              the  Constitutional  Court.  The  implication  is   that   the
              Constitutional Court, which is not elected, has to finish  the
              draft by clarifying the vague  clauses  in  the  Constitution.
              However, the Basque Country has raised a concern regarding the
              Spanish Courts. The Basque Country has decided not to use  the
              Spanish Courts, for in 90% of cases they have taken  to  court
              their powers were reduced.


         2. The Audit Tribunal reviews and adjudicates public accounts.  The
              Audit Tribunal tries to resolve an issue before it is sent  to
              the Constitutional Court.


         3.   Besides  these  mechanisms,  there  is  another  mechanism  to
              resolving conflicts between the State  and  the  AC.  In  this
              process the central government negotiates with  an  AC  for  3
              months. If an  agreement  is  not  reached,  they  go  to  the
              Constitutional Court for extension. The  Constitutional  Court
              can extend the period of negotiation up to 9 months.


     J.  Overview of Lessons for South Africa


         1. Closer to  the  time  that  the  Department  begins  to  further
              develop  its  IGR  policy  and  legislation,   the   Portfolio
              Committee will discuss this report in some detail,  especially
              for the lessons it offers to our own country. The lessons have
              already been suggested in the way the report  has  focused  on
              issues taken up above.  Below  is  a  brief  overview  of  the
              lessons.


         2.  It is important to locate the Spanish system within a  uniquely
              Spanish context. For instance, Spain was fortunate in that its
              transition to democracy  took  place  within  the  context  of
              relative social stability  and  a  growing  economy.  It  was,
              moreover, a society with relatively low levels  of  inequality
              within and between regions. These conditions do not  apply  to
              South Africa. They point though  to  the  challenges  our  IGR
              system  confronts,  especially   given   the   huge   material
              disparities  within  our  country.   These   disparities   are
              reflected not just between provinces and  municipalities,  but
              within the population as a whole. We have  among  the  highest
              income inequalities in the world. The need for  redistribution
              partly explains  the  relatively  strong  national  sphere  of
              government we have, and the system of co-operative  governance
              we have opted for.


         3.  One of the striking lessons of the Spanish  experience  is  how
              long it takes to develop a stable IGR  system.  It  has  taken
              Spain some 23 years to implement  a  national  and  provincial
              system which is only now being acknowledged as  reaching  some
              sort of finality. There are a number of reasons for this,  the
              most important of which may be unique to Spain, especially the
              post-constitution process-led  asymmetrical  establishment  of
              the ACs and negotiated conferral of powers and functions.  But
              stakeholders made it clear  that  this  time-frame,  far  from
              being a hindrance,  has  contributed  positively  towards  the
              evolution of the system. In  our  country  there  has  been  a
              certain tendency to expect too much progress  too  soon.  Some
              key practitioners have even called for a fundamental review of
              our provincial system or our new model of local government  or
              our co-operative governance system  generally,  as  relatively
              new as  they  are.  While  these  systems  must  be  regularly
              reviewed, surely it is far too soon to contemplate fundamental
              changes.  The  allocation  of  yet  further  powers  to  local
              government in South Africa should also be dealt with gradually
              and sensitively.


         4.  Constitutional asymmetry is  not  in  itself  unique,  but  the
              extent and manner of  its  application  in  Spain  surely  is.
              Though the  reasons  for  this  are  largely  historical,  its
              adoption as  a  constitutional  mechanism  is  viewed  by  key
              stakeholders in Spain as successful. In South Africa, however,
              there is little support for asymmetry. There are many  reasons
              for this. This includes the  need  to  create  national  unity
              following the deep divisions created by apartheid;  the  acute
              inequalities between the provinces; the lack  of  sufficiently
              strong regional identities; the need to create stability;  and
              the establishment of a simple provincial system. The  majority
              of the participants in the study tour felt, as much  as  there
              were many useful lessons to draw, that the Spanish  system  of
              asymmetry was not suitable for South Africa, at least  not  at
              this stage. The minority felt  that  consideration  should  be
              given to asymmetry in South Africa based in  part  on  lessons
              drawn from the Spanish experience.


         5.  Each level of government plays an important  role  in  revenue-
              collection. This is, however,  less  pronounced  in  the  non-
              historical ACs which seem to collect only between 12% and  15%
              of their own revenue. The State and the ACs divide  individual
              taxes between themselves rather than disbursing revenues  from
              an undifferentiated pool. Of course, in South Africa provinces
              rely on the constitutional provision of an  "equitable  share"
              The Constitution provides for legislation  to  be  passed  for
              provinces to have further revenue-raising powers -  but  there
              is no significant step  in  this  direction.  There  are  many
              reasons for this. In the main, they revolve around the  nature
              of our co-operative governance system and the early stages  of
              it that we are in at present. Some limited  form  of  revenue-
              raising powers are not to be ruled out altogether,  especially
              if they do not undermine the objectives  of  creating  greater
              social equality in the country overall.


         6.  While by no means  unknown  in  Spain,  unfunded  mandates  are
              seemingly not the problem as they  are  in  South  Africa.  In
              Spain,  both  AC  government  and   local   government   enjoy
              constitutional and statutory entitlement to  adequate  revenue
              as  well  as  protection  against  unfunded  mandates.   Local
              government in South Africa is particularly vulnerable- and  it
              might well be necessary to provide stronger safeguards for  it
              against unfunded mandates, beyond to what is provided  in  the
              Constitution and the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act.


         7.  Whether Spain is federal or decentralised  is  a  question  not
              unfamiliar  to  South  Africans.  Interestingly,  left-leaning
              parties  in  Spain  support  federalism  while   right-leaning
              parties support a more unitary approach. This is the  opposite
              of the situation in South Africa. Both ACs and  municipalities
              enjoy considerable legislative, executive and fiscal autonomy.
              The central government enjoys  fewer  intervention  mechanisms
              than is the case in South Africa. In many senses, the ACs have
              more power than our provinces. In some sense, local government
              in Spain also has more power, but in  other  senses,  it  does
              not. Unlike in South Africa, local government  in  Spain  does
              not  have  original  powers  and  functions  set  out  in  the
              Constitution. Key stakeholders  in  Spain  were  impressed  to
              learn about our system of local government, and were struck by
              how advanced our vision and framework for local government  as
              set out in the Constitution, legislation and policies is.


         8.  As is common in many federal or  quasi-federal  systems,  there
              are a myriad of institutions managing IGR in Spain.  Of  note,
              however, is that most are not expressly provided  for  in  the
              Constitution. Rather, they have evolved over time  to  reflect
              the exigencies of IGR within a particular period. Furthermore,
              they are even then not necessarily creatures of statute.  This
              re-emphasises the need to avoid unnecessarily  regulating  our
              system of IGR, especially as it is so new.


         9.  It was instructive to see how political parties  contribute  to
              stabilising IGR by dealing with differences  between  ACs  and
              the center and between the ACs through  their  internal  party
              structures. This is, of course, also the case in our country -
              and obviously more so because of the strength of the  majority
              party. Clearly, political parties in this country have a vital
              role to play in stabilising our system of IGR.


         10. The Portfolio Committee was very stimulated by its  study  tour
              of Spain and would like to pursue the issues  raised  in  this
              Report further through various means.
