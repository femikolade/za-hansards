                DEBATE ON MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT

Mr N M NENE: Madam Speaker, the podium timer is flashing the wrong time.  It
is indicating seven minutes and I have been allocated 10 minutes.

Madam Speaker and hon members, the Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement  is,
in the Minister's own words -
  ... an invitation to Parliament, and to  the  nation,  to  share  in  our
  deliberations about the challenges before us, on:


  - how we promote more rapid, sustainable economic growth and development,
  - how we progressively realise the social and economic rights promised in
     our Constitution,
  - how we prioritise spending to achieve a balanced and effective delivery
     of services to our people, and
  - how we raise the finances required, without unduly restraining economic
     activity or unfairly burdening the poor.

The statement before us, which is the Medium-Term Budget  Policy  Statement,
sets the fiscal planning framework for  the  upcoming  Budget  and  the  two
years following that. It includes up-to-date  macroeconomic  projections,  a
revised fiscal framework setting out affordable levels of  taxation,  public
spending and borrowing, the  analysis  of  existing  spending  plans  and  a
summary of likely implications for service delivery. It also  sets  out  the
main policy choices that Government confronts as it finalises its Budget.

The Budget process has been undergoing tremendous  transformation  over  the
past few years that  has  culminated  in  the  birth  of  the  Joint  Budget
Committee. The pursuit of the  ANC's  vision  of  a  prosperous,  equitable,
stable and democratic society has made it possible for the process  to  move
in this direction.

The terms of reference mandate  the  Joint  Budget  Committee,  firstly,  to
consider the proposed allocation in the  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework
and the Appropriation Bill, and whether these  allocations  are  in  keeping
with the policy directions of  Government.  They  also  mandate  us  as  the
committee to  make  proposals  regarding  the  processes  Parliament  should
follow with regard to its role in the developing of  budgets  in  accordance
with the constitutional requirements.

Also, they mandate us  to  monitor  monthly  published  actual  revenue  and
expenditure per department on a regular basis and to ascertain whether  they
are in line with Budget projections. They also mandate us to  consider  when
tabled, as we are doing today, the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement  with
the exception of the sections dealing with the macroeconomic  situation  and
revenue.

The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement has six sections. Sections  2,3  and
4, which deal with the macroeconomic  outlook  and  the  fiscal  issues  and
taxation, are dealt with by the  finance  committee,  as  hon  members  will
realise. We will confine ourselves to Chapters 5 and 6, which deal with  the
expenditure framework  and  also  the  allocation  to  provinces  and  local
government.

We are also mandated to conduct  hearings  on  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure
Framework and Budget Policy Review document, again  with  the  exception  of
those sections which deal with the macroeconomic situation and  revenue.  We
are also mandated to exercise those powers under  Joint  Rule  32  that  may
assist us in carrying out our functions,  and to report on  the  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement regarding the matters referred to above.

The statement outlines the priorities  of  Government  and  the  appropriate
measurable objectives of each department. In line  with  this  mandate,  the
committee conducted hearings with Government departments and civil  society,
which made very important submissions to the committee  despite  very  tight
timeframes. The committee will, however, have to find a way  of  encouraging
civil society to participate in this  process  because  their  participation
was very minimal.

The following clusters appeared before the  committee.  The  first  was  the
social services cluster, with  a  particular  focus  on  poverty  reduction,
development  and  human  capacity-building.  The  second  was  the  economic
cluster, which focused on black economic empowerment  and  land  reform  and
agricultural development. Then there was the  protection  services  cluster,
which focused on strengthening the fight against crime in  order  to  create
an environment which is conducive to  investment  and  economic  growth.  We
also heard the administration services cluster,  which  was  represented  by
the  Department  of  Home   Affairs,   which   is   currently   engaged   in
administrative upgrading. We also  received  written  submissions  from  the
Financial and Fiscal Commission. Civil society  was  represented  by  Fedusa
and the People's Budget.

The  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework   seeks   to   consolidate   policy
achievements and to enhance further equality and  effectiveness  of  service
delivery to the poor.  This  is  supported  by  a  significant  increase  in
baseline allocation. The preliminary framework  proposes  R84,9  billion  in
additional allocations over the baseline amounts, with a marked increase  in
the allocation to provinces. In relative terms,  local  government  receives
the largest increase at  18,4%  over  the  baseline,  compared  with  9%  to
provincial governments and 7,3% to national departments.  Another  important
achievement is the increase in  spending  on  the  economic  infrastructure,
human capital and other priorities over the MTEF, which grows by  an  annual
average of 4,7% in real terms.

Significant increases in spending will not, on their own,  guarantee  better
outcomes.  Therefore  Government  will  have  to  continue   to   strengthen
administrative capacity  and  improve  co-ordination  between  national  and
provincial  departments  and  municipalities  to  ensure   that   a   higher
proportion of spending reaches  the  intended  beneficiaries  and  that  the
quality of that spending is improved. Additional resources  have  also  been
made available over the MTEF period to all three spheres  of  government  to
compensate for inflation, which has been higher than was anticipated at  the
time of the 2002 Budget. My colleagues will deal more with  the  details  of
these increases as they also form part of the adjustments estimate.

Madam Speaker, allow me to take this opportunity  to  thank  all  those  who
participated in this  process  -  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  National
Treasury,  parliamentary  staff,  researchers,  the  Financial  and   Fiscal
Commission,  civil  society,  Government  departments,   various   portfolio
committees in different clusters and members of the Joint  Budget  Committee
- for their valuable contribution and I trust that the level  of  commitment
shown thus far will propel us as we tackle  the  next  phase  of  our  work.
[Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker and hon members, the DA believes  that  poverty
reduction is built on  two  mutually  supporting  and  mutually  reinforcing
areas: that of poverty eradication on a sustainable basis rooted  in  strong
economic growth and that of poverty alleviation as  an  interim  measure  en
route to higher  growth.  Only  a  much  higher  economic  growth  path  can
therefore ensure in the long run that the better life for  all  promised  by
so many  electioneering  slogans  does  not  become  a  dream  deferred.  My
colleague Mr Clelland-Stokes will focus on poverty alleviation.  Suffice  it
for me to say that to show unambiguously that Government is  taking  poverty
alleviation seriously it must give a clear indication of what steps it  will
initiate to further the proposals of the Taylor commission.

Let us start with the bouquets. Apart from the continued fiscal success  and
impressive deficit performance, other highly commendable areas  include  the
continued steady  decline  in  debt  servicing  costs  and  the  first,  yet
seemingly steady, steps  Government  is  taking  to  contribute  to  savings
instead of continuing on a  destructive  path  of  government  dissaving.  A
bouquet is also due for the strong performance of the  current  account  and
the first, albeit modest, surplus since 1994.

Given the global economic environment in the aftermath of 11  September,  it
would be ungracious not to comment positively on the upward revision of  GDP
growth projections to 2,6 in 2002 and 3,5 for 2003. However,  the  DA  noted
with concern submissions from J P Morgan  that  the  revised  rates  may  be
overly optimistic due to the continued impact of inflationary pressures  and
related monetary tightening, as  well  as  continued  uncertainty  over  the
state of the global economy.

The DA firmly believes that only accelerated growth in  excess  of  6%  will
enable South  Africa  to  make  a  meaningful  impact  on  unemployment  and
poverty. While some  of  the  factors  inhibiting  higher  growth,  such  as
emerging market  contagion  effects  and  a  sluggish  global  economy,  are
outside our scope  of  policy  influence,  there  are  continued  structural
changes that can be made in domestic  economic  policy.  These  changes  are
only hamstrung by questions of political  will  and  ill-advised  strong-arm
tactics such as Cosatu's antiprivatisation strike in October.

 It is now conventional wisdom that the inflation target  for  2002-03  will
be missed. While the Minister of Finance, thankfully,  did  not  change  the
CPIX measure or change the basket substantially, the agreement  between  the
Minister and the Reserve Bank saw the 3-5% target fall  away  until  further
notice. However, as Mazwai Securities noted in  their  comments  before  the
committee, due to  the  manner  in  which  the  inflation  target  has  been
adjusted, markets still require greater clarity  on  how  inflation  targets
are set and altered  and  for  predictable  procedures  within  the  broader
inflation-targeting framework. This framework requires further  modification
and attention, and we have a number of proposals in  this  regard  which  we
will circulate to the Minister.

These are but a few changes to  the  framework  that  could  strengthen  its
predictability, thereby enhancing its credibility. It is important to  note,
however, that within an open economy such as ours, the inflation  forecasts,
as  well  as  many  other  assumptions  in  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement, are highly dependent on the performance  of  the  rand,  and  any
renewed currency instability could jeopardise all these projections.

The Adjustments Appropriation Bill contains a roll-over plan for the  Telkom
IPO and it leads to the question yet again: Is Telkom's  call  on  hold?  We
have seen a number of delays in this area, and concerns around the  proceeds
of privatisation continue yet again, with a very modest projection over  the
MTEF cycle of R13 billion.

The thrust of the policy statement to prioritise social expenditure must  be
welcomed. There can be no doubt that South Africa's greatest  needs  are  in
the social areas of health, education and social  development.  These  needs
are vast, and consistently delivering  growth  rates  that  do  not  make  a
meaningful impact on poverty and unemployment simply means that these  needs
will grow and people will continue to be  dependent  on  the  state  in  the
absence of opportunities for employment and self-sustaining activities.

It is therefore time for bold thinking and even bolder action to  break  out
of the rut and ensure that poverty eradication  through  strong  and  robust
growth becomes the goal of an open society of opportunity  and  that  we  do
not get stuck in poverty alleviation. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Speaker, the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement  is
produced to give broad direction and context to the medium-term  expenditure
framework, which follows a few months later. Against  Government's  analysis
and projections of  the  key  macroeconomic  developments,  the  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement provides the fiscal and tax policy and  the  revenue
and expenditure frameworks for the next few years. I think it  is  important
for us in Parliament to remind ourselves of our role  in  relation  to  this
policy statement.

In the finance committee we had, I think, a very thorough  scrutiny  of  the
macroeconomic and fiscal aspects of  the  policy  statement.  In  the  Joint
Budget Committee, which was hastily formed shortly before this, I  think  we
had a bit more of a difficult time, especially with regard to  quizzing  the
national departments' DGs, but I am sure that under the capable guidance  of
Chairperson Nene we will go from strength to strength and next year do  even
better than we did in our initial year.

Turning to the substance of the  policy  statement  and  in  particular  its
views on the macroeconomy, we have both a warm and  a  comfortable  reaction
to Treasury's positions, which are, of course, the positions  of  Government
as well. These are warm  in  so  far  as  the  views  indicate  a  generally
improving situation and comfortable in so  far  as  we  largely  agree  with
these views. I think  the  major  positions  here  could  include  the  debt
position,  the  budget  deficit,  current  GDP  trends,  the  trade  account
surplus, industrial productivity improvements, cash flows including FDI  and
currency stabilisation in the current year. There are a number that I  could
still mention. However, economies and economic  behaviour  being  what  they
are, we can never fully discount  the  possibilities  of  unkind  twists  of
fate, especially in the realms of GDP growth and inflation.

Regarding the statement's GDP projection, I think the two  imponderables  we
need to bear in mind here are,  firstly  falling  exports  and  the  effects
thereof which could happen through a strengthening rand and,  secondly,  the
possibilities of global growth conditions and their effects on our economy.

Turning to the inflation projections, what we would be concerned about  here
is if Treasury's projections, which we agree with, were not to be  realised,
and I think we would also see a strong downward-turn movement over the  next
13  months  attributed  in  some  part,  possibly,  to   a  more   promising
agricultural season, an improving oil price, a  strengthened  exchange  rate
with the imported component of  inflation  that  that  relates  to  and  the
resultant reversal in interest rate  direction  which  this  will  lead  to,
which in itself is a factor in inflation.

I think the big underlying issue regarding  the  economy  is  its  stability
relative to most other economies in the world. If we take  out  last  year's
externally caused rand-dollar experience and its role in  current  inflation
levels, there are perhaps only two or three other  economies  in  the  world
which can currently compare to our  performance.  Should  we  sustain  this,
both conventional wisdom  and  international  experience  would  suggest,  I
think, that investor interest in South Africa must be growing.

Regarding the policy statement's fiscal projections, there are  one  or  two
issues here that we might ask about, the first being the  revenue  estimate.
As has been the case for each of the past  four  years,  Treasury  has  been
much too cautious here. If GDP growth is even reasonable for the  final  two
quarters of  the  current  year,  next  year's  tax  take  will  exceed  the
projection, and that is before the  Commissioner  of  Sars  hunts  down  his
usual quota of evaders.

The other issue we need to register a question on is  the  budgeted  deficit
over  the  next  three-year  term.  I   think,   given   the   uncomfortable
socioeconomic conditions which the unemployed and many of the  lower  income
earners are currently experiencing, we wonder  whether  it  would  not  have
been better to have allowed this to move out to  about  2,5%  of  GDP,  thus
giving us a further R5 billion per annum for poverty relief.

Moving to the chapter on  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  and  the
proportions  and  patterns  of  its  horizontal  and  vertical   expenditure
distribution across  Government,  we  have  no  serious  arguments.  We  can
support the balancing of the competing priorities this represents.

Overall the latest policy statement  confirms  that  the  Budget  is  making
progress and is becoming increasingly thoughtful and policy-sensitive.  With
the introduction of annual strategic planning exercises  in  all  Government
departments  we  can  expect  even  further   progress   towards   capturing
Government's policy objectives in future years' budgets.

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, the present  Medium-
Term Budget Statement is a proposed social, economic  and  fiscal  framework
for the next three years.

What is significant is that Government's contribution to growth  has  turned
positive. The present private capital spending  trend  is  also  encouraging
and indications are that the  present  steady  economic  growth  is  due  to
continue in the forthcoming financial year.

Our present unemployment rate of 29,4% is a cause for serious  concern.  The
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement states that  an  estimated  4,7  million
work-seekers find themselves without jobs. This must also  be  seen  in  the
context of the depreciation of the rand and a  high  rise  in  consumer  and
producer prices.

If we look  at  the  macroeconomic  perspective  we  see  that  a  shift  in
priorities from inflation to growth can be discerned. The  inflation  target
band  announced  is  realistic  and  the  fiscal  policy  can   be   broadly
categorised as expansionary.

Vir die  huidige  fiskale  jaar  tot  dié  van  2005-06  sal  die  jaarlikse
geprojekteerde groeikoers in die besteding aan onderwys  meer  as  9%  wees,
terwyl gesondheid en welsyn op 10,8% en 8,2% te staan kom. [For the  present
fiscal year until that of  2005-06  the  annual  projected  growth  rate  in
expenditure on education will  be  more  than  9%,  whereas  expenditure  on
health and welfare amounts to 10,8% and 8,2%.]

Other government sectors that will benefit  are  local  government,  justice
and correctional services. The  increased  government  spending  will  occur
without any steep increase in personal tax.  The  hon  the  Minister  stated
that  one  of  the  long-term  objects  of  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement is to reduce personal tax and to keep  the  Budget  deficit  under
2,5% of GDP, which is commendable.

The Minister, in  his  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement,  stated  that
economic growth rates of 3,5%, 3,7% and 3,9% are attainable  for  the  years
2003, 2004 and 2005. A number of  economists  in  the  private  sector  have
speculated that the Minister's projected  economic  growth  figures  can  be
defined as optimistic. J P Morgan, in fact, reduced  the  economic  forecast
for economic growth for  next  year  from  3,1%  to  2,5%  due  to  volatile
international economic conditions and the sharp increase in interest rates.

Ekonomiese groei sal  al  die  sektore  van  die  ekonomie  bevoordeel.  Die
optimistiese groeiverwagtinge kan deels toegeskryf word aan die groei in  'n
styging  in  reële  vaste  investering.  Indien  die  voorspelde  ekonomiese
groeikoers  egter   nie   realiseer   nie   kan   'n   verdere   afname   in
verbruikersbesteding  na  vore  kom.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Economic growth will be to the advantage of all  sectors  of  the  economy.
The optimistic growth expectations can be ascribed partly to an increase  in
real fixed investment. However, if the projected  economic  growth  rate  is
not achieved, a further decrease in consumer spending may follow.]

The revenue growth for this year is 17,5%. This can be attributed to  strong
growth in corporate tax revenue, strong retail sales, which have helped  VAT
collection,  and  the  continuing  improvement  in  the  efficiency  of  tax
collection, a positive achievement which in the long  run  will  be  to  the
benefit of all.

Inflation targeting is of the utmost  importance  for  an  emerging  economy
like South Africa's.  We  are  subject  to  the  destabilising  shocks  from
international capital  flows  and  exchange  rate  moves.  It  is  therefore
important that all the role-players have more frequent  meetings  to  reduce
the risk of getting behind the inflation  curve.  The  fact  that  inflation
targets were missed in  2002-03  is  not  a  fatal  blow  to  our  inflation
targeting. Only repeated target misses would justify  a  serious  review  of
our inflation strategy.

A number of macroeconomic policy factors will have to be  addressed  in  the
forthcoming budget. The first is  the  serious  lack  of  domestic  savings.
Secondly,  investment  must  be  an  ongoing  focus.  Thirdly,   a   further
relaxation of exchange controls is  important  and  will  encourage  foreign
investor confidence. Fourthly, taxation of retirement funds at  the  present
rate is  unacceptable  and  increases  the  welfare  burden  on  the  state.
Fifthly, further measures to encourage savings  are  required.  One  of  the
best  ways  to  reduce  poverty  is  to   create   employment   and   growth
opportunities.

Monetary policy is the sphere of the  Reserve  Bank.  However,  it  must  be
noted  that  Government  sets  the  inflation  targets.   The  increase   in
Government spending this year was largely due to a 9% wage hike.
The CPIX inflation forecast in the Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement  has
increased from 6,7% to 10%  for  this  particular  fiscal  year.  It  is  my
opinion that the market is still left with uncertainty on  how  the  Reserve
Bank will respond to future inflationary crises and what procedures will  be
in place for this.

The  increase  in  the  money  supply  is  a  cause  for  concern,  but  the
significance of economic growth and the increasing  levels  of  unemployment
owing to  escalating  interest  rates  must  also  be  taken  into  account.
Interest rates are high at present because  of  emerging  economy  dynamics.
The volatility and unpredictability of our exchange rate is a major  problem
in this regard. The current balance between the rand and the  currencies  of
our major trading partners favours us, however. On  the  whole  the  Medium-
Term Expenditure Framework must  be  seen  against  the  slowdown  in  world
economic growth and increasing concern with corporate accountability,  which
is creating a degree of hesitancy within investment circles.

To conclude, this statement  is  in  essence  a  shift  in  priorities  from
inflation containment via interest rates to  growth.  The  New  NP  supports
this statement. [Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker and hon members, there are  three  issues  in
the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement that need  further  comment,  namely
infrastructure development, savings and inflation. I will deal briefly  with
each of these three areas of concern.

Firstly, one of the cornerstones of the UDM's economic policy  is  increased
spending on infrastructure development in  South  Africa.  This  means  that
more funds should be earmarked to be spent  on  infrastructure  development,
including  the  maintenance  and  upgrading  of   existing   infrastructure.
Infrastructure maintenance refers to the maintenance of  our  road  network,
water purification systems, sanitation and power networks.

We commend the Minister and the  Government  for  increasing  infrastructure
spending in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, because this is  in  line
with official UDM policy. The challenge however,  is  to  do  more.  In  the
words of the Minister himself: ''More needs to be done.'' The UDM  says  the
Government must do more. If this means state intervention, let  us  call  it
that.

The time has arrived for Government  to  invest  heavily  in  infrastructure
development projects in all three spheres of government. The  Department  of
Public Works has a crucial and important role  to  play  to  invest  massive
amounts of money in infrastructure projects that  will  create  jobs  -  for
instance, dams, roads, airports, harbours, clinics, schools, houses and  the
tourism industry. From the word go, it must be certain  that  this  spending
will be efficient and that the capacity is developed to ensure delivery.

How do we finance such a large-scale infrastructure development project?  At
present we are in a position to grow the budget  deficit  from  its  current
low level. We have the opportunity to  spend  money  on  new  infrastructure
projects and to upgrade the  existing  infrastructures,  which  will  create
more jobs. In the October issue of  Leadership  it  was  reported  that  for
every  one  billion  rand  invested   in   South   Africa's   infrastructure
development, 16 000 new jobs  are  created,  the  GDP  is  boosted  by  R440
million and R175 million is  generated  in  additional  taxes.  We  have  no
option but to go this route.

Secondly, we need a policy to stimulate savings. We  urge  the  Minister  to
start a savings drive by dramatically increasing the  tax  exemption  levels
of savings in the Budget Speech in February 2003. Why should  the  exemption
of interest earnings not be increased to, say,  R50  000  per  person?  This
will provide a proper incentive for individuals to save.

Thirdly, and  in  conclusion,  regarding  inflation,  a  certain  amount  of
uncertainty has been created by the fact  that  the  inflation  targets  for
2005 have not been announced, despite the fact that  an  estimate  has  been
pitched at less than 5%. We urge the Minister to announce the  2005  targets
as soon as possible, but not later than in the 2003-04 Budget.

With these few observations, the UDM will  support  the  Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement.

Ms B A HOGAN: Madam Speaker, the Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement  gives
us an idea of where Government will be moving when it tables its  Budget  in
February, and so it is a  very  important  document,  because  it  tells  us
where, over the next three years, we are likely to  be  spending  our  money
and what we will be achieving out of the spending of that money.

There could not possibly be a better economic environment than  we  have  at
the moment - and I am talking domestically, and not  internationally  -  for
the tabling of this Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement.  So  many  of  our
economic indicators are looking good: the balance of payments, GDP,  revised
upwards growth,  private  consumption  expenditure  on  a  steady  path  and
increasing  investment  in  production  capacity.  The  economy  is  looking
steady, it is looking healthy, it is looking as though it is ready for take-
off.

However, the international environment in which we are  operating  mitigates
against certainty, and what happens in the Middle East  is  certainly  going
to have a profound impact on what happens in our economy here. But  what  we
must say and what we need to be proud of is that our economy, during one  of
the roughest times for the international economy, has been resilient. It  is
growing steadily and it has hardly suffered from the impact of  the  turmoil
elsewhere.

Of course, a lot of this has to be attributed  to  the  policies  that  have
been brought about by the  ANC  in  Government.  I  think  our  Ministry  of
Finance and our Cabinet need special congratulations for the  steady  course
on which they have guided our economy over the last eight years or  so.  Had
it not been for the firmness of direction,  I  doubt  we  would  be  in  the
position that we are in now.

The one looming problem on the horizon has been inflation, which has  reared
its ugly head. We see now, even in Business Day  today,  that  the  expected
growth in inflation is projected to turn around next year, which is  a  good
omen. But  what  the  inflation-targeting  regime  has  taught  us  is  that
inflation-targeting in a developing economy is not a simple matter.

I want to thank the opposition parties in the debate  today  for  having  an
understanding of and insight into the difficulties  accompanying  inflation-
targeting in an economy which is as  open  to  outside  shocks  as  ours  is
today. However, inflation-targeting is not an easy thing  for  any  economy.
If one looks at the  UK  economy,  the  Bank  of  England  has  consistently
undershot its inflation target. In other words it comes in  under  what  has
been projected. It might sound like a good thing to many of  us  to  have  a
low inflation target, but when one is reaching a  regime  of  virtually  nil
inflation and very low interest  rates,  one  is  moving  very  close  to  a
recessionary regime. Yet the Bank of England has consistently undershot  its
inflation targets.

So it is not unknown, but in fact  very  well  known  internationally,  that
inflation-targeting is not a precise instrument that can be used easily.  It
is a very difficult ship to  manoeuvre.  In  that  regard,  we  welcome  the
Minister's allowing the inflation target to fall away from 3-5% to  3-6%.  I
think it gives the Governor of the Reserve Bank a lot  more  flexibility  to
manage what has indeed been a difficult period.  As  my  colleague  Reinette
Taljaard has said, I think there are proposals  that  one  can  make  around
fine-tuning our inflation-targeting regime and we certainly will be  raising
these issues in our committee with both the Minister and the Reserve Bank.

I want to move on to the actual fiscal policy environment in  which  we  are
tabling this Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. It is very  gratifying  to
see that the rate at which the  amount  of  money  that  we  are  paying  in
interest on the debt that we owe is declining very steadily. One merely  has
to think of how, when we came into government, virtually 20% of  our  budget
was spent on  just  paying  our  interest  costs,  and  how  that  has  been
declining. In fact this year, in terms  of  the  adjustments  estimate,  our
interest payments go down - I cannot remember the exact number  -  by  about
R260 million, and that is indeed a welcome turnaround. Already  we  see  the
benefits, as we have seen in the last couple of  years,  of  being  able  to
release more expenditure for other social and economic priorities.

What we have noticed, though - and this was general, from everyone who  made
presentations to us, from J P Morgan right through the economic  spectrum  -
is that many were arguing that our budget deficit is  slightly  conservative
at this stage and we could actually be a little bit more ambitious in  terms
of that deficit target. I am aware that there are looming debt issues  which
we have to deal with, for instance the R28 billion  on  our  losses  on  our
cover on forward exchange. I am aware that these are things that one  cannot
simply wish away. Nevertheless I do think  that  we  need  to  look  at  the
question of just how fiscally conservative  we  have  been  and  whether  we
cannot just relax even a tiny bit more at the moment.

In regard to that, obviously we would say that where we would  be  directing
any increased spending, as we do now, is towards  growing  the  economy  and
alleviating poverty. And  in  that  sense  I  agree  with  my  colleague  Dr
Koornhof that investing in infrastructure does both. It allows  the  economy
to grow and it also alleviates poverty.

But I have often wondered to myself - and I know that the ANC at the  moment
is in the throes of a discussion around this: Have  we  yet  considered  the
possibilities  of  a  well-co-ordinated,   well-implemented   public   works
programme? I am not talking about the  itty-bitty  implementations  that  we
have seen over this period of time.  I  am  not  talking  about  the  futile
poverty alleviation projects that sometimes just fall away  because  of  the
lack of sustainability. I am talking about the imaginative  programmes  such
as the Working for Water programme that we are  seeing.  That  has  been  an
enormously  successful  programme.   It   has   a   feel-good   factor   for
environmental  reasons,  it  employs   people   who   would   otherwise   be
unemployable in a sustainable way and it has  created  downstream  benefits,
for instance the production of charcoal.

 Now we really do need to be looking at public works  programmes,  not  just
in terms of building dams, roads, etc, in the way the United States  did  in
the 1930s. We need to be looking at  those  gaps  where  the  state  is  not
providing, and how we can come in as a  state,  maybe  in  partnership  with
others, to promote a  more  sustainable  and  more  growthful  public  works
programme than we had in the past. I am saying that because I  believe  that
poverty alleviation can be assisted only with  the  implementation  of  far-
ranging and far-reaching public works  programmes  that  have  to  be  well-
organised and well-orchestrated.

The other claims an additional expenditure might  include  improving  social
insurance, for instance, income grants and UIF benefits. I  do  not  dismiss
the possibilities of those, but they all ignore the benefits  of  investment
in the economy that a public works programme -  and  a  major  public  works
programme - could allow for this economy.

I do not believe that a public works programme should  fall  under  any  one
department. I think it needs to fall under a range of departments.  I  think
it needs to be implemented slowly and not in a  big-bang  approach,  because
that seldom works. But we owe it  to  the  poverty-stricken  people  of  our
country, and we owe it to the inadequate  economic  infrastructure  that  we
have at the moment, to look very seriously and, I say,  imaginatively  to  a
public works  programme  that  can  complement  our  present  infrastructure
programme, which is gaining in momentum. Perhaps we need to pick up on  that
momentum and move forward.

With that I conclude my comments on the macroeconomic implications  of  this
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement and I have pleasure in recommending,  on
behalf of the ANC, the adoption of the statement. [Applause.]

Mr L M  GREEN:  Madam  Speaker,  the  ACDP  supports  the  2003  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework spending  priorities,  especially  those  relating  to
poverty reduction and development, improving  municipal  infrastructure  and
basic services, accelerating land reform and restitution and  improving  the
capacity in the safety and security sector, particularly the  administration
of justice in our courts. Allocating more funds to social and basic  service
delivery does not necessarily mean there will be a dramatic  improvement  in
delivery.

We must make sure that Government gets the best  value  for  money.  Let  me
give an example to the Minister of Finance. Recently, an official  from  the
Department of Education reported that  the  department  spends  R15  000  to
replace a toilet in a Western Cape school and R25 000 in a  school  situated
in Limpopo province. Of course we do realise that these are  inflated  costs
and that the real cost is R1 200.

The economy of the country, according to the Minister of Finance, is set  to
grow by 2,6% this year and steadily increase  to  3,9%  in  2005.  This,  of
course, is good news and does show that South Africa is a  country  able  to
withstand major odds stacked against it. It goes  without  saying  that  the
rate of  economic  growth  is  stimulated  by  a  partnership  of  political
stability. The more a country matures politically, the greater the  increase
in its economic benefits. The ACDP  is  concerned  that  Government  is  not
effectively bringing to account  those  civil  servants  at  provincial  and
local government level who failed to deliver adequately on basic services.

The SA Revenue Service has done well  to  collect  R8,1  billion  more  than
budgeted for this year. We are also able to keep our budget  deficit  within
1,6% of GDP. These figures show that we can effectively manage  our  economy
with the foresight required  to  built  a  better  future  for  our  nation.
However, there must be a line of efficiency that  goes  through  all  levels
and spheres of government.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members,  revisiting  and  evaluating
the strengths and weaknesses of the past in relation to the  Budget  enables
the National Treasury to project into the future and  thus  tighten  up  all
loose ends. The 2003 Medium-Term Expenditure  Framework  is  set  to  reduce
poverty and accelerate development. This is  easy to say, but how it  should
actually be done begs for  answers.  The  extension  of  social  assistance,
health and education calls for more resolve from Government  when  one  sees
how the old, vulnerable and frail people jostle and fall  over  one  another
at paypoints. Surely this noble idea of reducing poverty has to  be  pursued
at no cost to the lives of our people at paypoints.

There is a clear determination to improve the  criminal  justice  system  in
this programme. Efforts continue to be  made  to  get  rid  of  backlogs  at
courts and a financial injection is given to safety and security. This  will
ensure that the SA Police Service measures up to the  high  crime  rate  and
the terrorism which keeps rearing its head these days. The  modern  approach
to correctional services will also be enhanced with the envisaged  increases
to these budgets.
The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework proposes to take the fight  to  social
ills. Increases in social grants to the vulnerable groups are most  welcome.
Old age pensions, child support grants and disability grants  will  increase
in an effort to keep inflation  at  bay.  Also  most  welcome  is  the  R400
million set  aside  to  provide  relief  for  those  whose  livelihoods  are
threatened by rising food prices. However, the question remains  as  to  how
such people will be identified.

All in all, the National Treasury has done good work,  as  usual.  They  are
capable of that and have done it very  well.  Therefore  it  is  up  to  the
departments, the provinces and the municipalities to use  these  allocations
for the good of the nation. The UCDP supports the Medium-Term Budget  Policy
Statement.

Ms N S MTSWENI: Madam Speaker, the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development
held in Johannesburg earlier this year resulted in a global commitment to  a
number  of  clear  targets  and  practical  steps  to  tackle  poverty   and
environmental degradation. National Environment Month challenges  all  South
Africans to translate this global commitment into local action.

History is important to us: It offers lessons from the past, it smooths  the
progress of transformation and it is key in addressing a way  forward.  Nine
years after the inception of the Reconstruction and  Development  Programme,
access to basic services has increased significantly and Government  is  now
seeking to provide a minimum package of free basic services for all.

We welcome the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement  as  it  provides  an
opportunity to the nation to discuss how the Department of Finance  proceeds
with the progressive realisation of the social and economic rights  promised
in  our  Constitution.  The  ANC  welcomes  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement and the  net  increase  in  spending  for  the  current  year.  In
addressing the policy priorities and the Budget, I quote from ANC Today:


  Many  South  Africans  continue  to  live  without  adequate  water   and
  sanitation. The majority of women in South Africa are unemployed.  Almost
  half of the women who are employed earn less than R500  a  month  and  as
  many as 60% of female-headed households are classified poor.


  The growth of about 23% of children  under  the  age  of  6  is  stunted,
  indicating  a  lengthy  period  of  undernutrition.  The  most  seriously
  affected children are those in rural areas. The infant mortality rate  is
  8-10 times higher for Africans than for whites.

The  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework   seeks   to   consolidate   policy
achievements and enhance further the quality and  effectiveness  of  service
delivery to the poor. This gives hope to our poor communities.  The  2002-03
Budget will build upon the  policy  priorities  laid  down  in  the  2001-02
Budget. Cabinet agreed on  the  need  to  consolidate  and  deepen  existing
budget priorities. Hence the 2002  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  will
continue to emphasise infrastructure investment and  the  extension  of  the
coverage and quality of social service delivery.

Cabinet has approved a further  increase  in  social  grants  to  vulnerable
groups  with  effect  from  1  October.  The  old  age  pension  grant,  the
disability grant and the child support grant were increased in October.  The
R3,8 billion adjustment also includes an amount of R4 million set  aside  to
provide relief to those whose livelihoods  are  threatened  by  rising  food
prices. For example, this means a poor family in  the  deep  rural  area  of
Mpumalanga will be able to afford a bag of maize  meal  and  to  send  their
children to school. There will be a change  in  their  lives  and  those  of
their children.

The stabilisation of enrolment in recent years and the achievement of  near-
universal primary enrolment  allow  the  emphasis  to  shift  decisively  to
quality-enhancing initiatives. An early child development program  has  been
piloted and will be progressively extended in the years  ahead.  We  welcome
this move and think that  it  is  a  well-considered  development,  as  many
disadvantaged children will benefit through it.

Adult basic education and training projects will also be  enhanced  in  part
through the new skills development funding  arrangement.  Another  important
priority  that  is  relevant  to   education   is   the   higher   education
restructuring, including support for institutional  mergers  and  investment
in infrastructure. A five-year  timeframe  for  completing  the  process  is
envisaged. The broader national skills development strategy  also  seeks  to
improve  the  supply  of  high-quality  skills  to  industry   and   enhance
productivity across the economy.

In  the  health  sector  additional  spending  will  provide  for   improved
compensation to health personnel and  expanding  employment,  investment  in
building hospitals and equipment and the rising cost of  medicine  supplies.
This means  that  a  hospital  in  KwaMhlanga  in  the  Ekangala  region  of
Mpumalanga will provide better  services  to  the  community.  The  hospital
nicknamed ``akubuywa'' [place from which there is no  return]  will  not  be
called that in a  few  days  from  today.  There  will  also  be  stepped-up
spending on HIV/Aids.

The Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure  Programme  is  one  of  the  main
vehicles for providing basic  infrastructure.  It  is  complemented  by  the
community  water  and  sanitation  programme,  which  focuses  on  providing
services  in  the  rural  areas  using  labour-based   approaches.   Another
important element of the Government's  poverty  alleviation  strategy  is  a
more equitable distribution of landownership in addressing this strategy.

I wanted to include a quotation, but because I do not  have  enough  time  I
will not do that. In  conclusion,  we  appreciate  what  the  department  of
economic affairs in Mpumalanga has contributed in  alleviating  poverty  and
creating better working conditions for a group of women at Spitzkop  in  the
Kangala region.

As the ANC we recommend that Parliament adopt the Medium-Term Budget  Policy
Statement. We are succeeding in bringing about a better  life  for  all  our
people in South Africa. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker,  the  Minister's  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement has some very important points and ideas with which we  agree.  He
talks of a caring economy, but unfortunately this is  still  a  mere  ideal.
The poor, the jobless, the homeless,  the  landless  and  those  who  cannot
afford school fees for the education of their children are not  experiencing
this caring economy. We hear that the fiscal position  is  healthy  and  the
economy is growing steadily, but no statistics  have  been  provided.  While
the PAC does not  dispute  this  fact,  we  must  state  that  many  African
businesspeople who thrived before 1994 have  gone  bankrupt.  In  the  rural
areas this business has now fallen into non-African hands.

The PAC agrees with the Minister that our women must  play  a  key  role  in
society and that at present they  carry  a  disproportionate  share  of  the
burden of poverty. In our country the population of women  is  estimated  at
54%. They are a vast majority. A political struggle which does not  liberate
women does not liberate a nation. The PAC wants to see  the  women  majority
reflected in education,  professions,  business  and  many  other  important
spheres of life.

The PAC subscribes  to  Nepad.  We  regard  it  as  the  brainchild  of  Pan
Africanism. This child has been there, as reflected in many  OAU  documents,
since as early as 24 May 1963, when a commission worked out a  continentwide
plan for a unified or common economic industrial programme  for  Africa.  Of
course, the PAC view is that Nepad will succeed  only  when  it  depends  on
African people themselves with the assistance of all people of  goodwill  in
the world toward Africa. But the G-8 countries are not a  reliable  partner,
as can be seen from the rumblings of President George Bush of America.

It is ridiculous that we in this country are paying for a foreign debt  that
was incurred for our genocide while many victims of apartheid whom  the  TRC
said must be compensated to the extent of R800 million are yet to receive  a
cent of that money. Nevertheless we support the policy statement.

Miss S RAJBALLY:  Madam  Speaker,  the  alleviation  of  poverty  being  our
primary focus, it is pleasing to note that the Medium-Term Budget  has  been
established in line with doing so. The increase in real spending on  matters
such as the Public Service, reinforcing Government's investment  in  people,
service delivery and growth are well set to achieve this.  It  is  important
to note that this is extremely challenging, noting a number of factors  that
have placed a lot of demands on the fiscus, such as the depreciation in  the
rand, rising fuel and food prices and expanding international commitments.

The key spending areas are well selected to address the  issues  of  society
and the administration. The substantial increase made to social services  is
welcomed, noting the need  and  shortages.  These  are  vital  to  alleviate
poverty and bring society into  line  with  good  and  healthy  living.  The
increase in social grants is one way of doing so,  but  here  good  criteria
for the selection of persons qualifying  for  such  assistance  have  to  be
established.

Improvements in medical  personnel  are  certainly  also  a  great  help  in
improving conditions in poorer provinces  and  the  attention  paid  to  the
HIV/Aids problem is promising too. Provisions to the  education  sector  are
suited to a changing society. The provisions  made  to  protection  services
have been well selected and reassuring. The increase in  SA  Police  Service
personnel,  court  efficiency  and  the  strengthening   of   anticorruption
measures are earnestly needed in view of the current situation.

Economic services and infrastructure  development  are  applauded,  with  an
increase  in  basic  services  to  communities,  free   basic   electricity,
sanitation and land reform. Adjustments  made  to  administration  are  also
advantageous and would hopefully meet the ends they aim to achieve.

The MF supports the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, dit is 'n bekende spreuk  dat  hoe  minder
opspraak 'n begroting verwek hoe beter is hy. Dit  was  die  geval  met  die
Minister   se   Mediumtermyn-bestedingsraamwerk.   Daar   was   geen   groot
verrassings nie. Dit behoort stabiliteit in  die  hand  te  werk  omdat  nie
afgewyk word van vorige jare se fiskale dissipline nie  en  dit  spreek  van
goeie beplanning, bestuur en kontrole.

Die AEB verwelkom die verdere beoogde belastingverligting, die  vermindering
van druk  op  rentekoerse,  die  hoër  groeiverwagtings  en  groeibevorderde
uitbreidings aan staatsbesteding. Die R2 miljard bykomend volgende jaar  vir
die Justisie sektor asook vir die  ekstra  5  000  lede  per  jaar  van  die
polisiemag  word  verwelkom,  maar  is  egter  nog   veels   te   min.   Die
misdaadsiekte  in  Suid-Afrika   benodig   'n   noodoperasie   en   nie   'n
aspirienpilletjie nie.

Die AEB verwelkom die versagting van inflasieteikens deur  die  3-6%  teiken
wat vir 2002-03 gestel is te verskuif na 2003-04 en af te sien van die  3-5%
teiken  tot  2004.  Hierdie  aanpassing  in  die  inflasieteiken   kan   die
onmiddellike druk op rentekoerse verlig en  maak  'n  verdere  verhoging  in
rentekoerse vir die jaar onwaarskynlik. Die onlangse  verstewiging  van  die
rand en die verlaging van die prys van ru-olie kan  daartoe  bydra  dat  die
teikens dalk gehaal word.

Die   AEB   vra   'n   hersiening   van   die   enkelvoudige   beleid    van
rentekoersverhogings om inflasie hok te slaan. Veral langtermynlenings  soos
huisverbande  moet  van  verdere   rentekoersverhogings   uitgesluit   word.
Aangesien alle instansies wat  langtermynfinansiering  verskaf  ook  in  die
korttermynmark bedrywig is, kan kruissubsidiëring maklik plaasvind.

Die groeiverwagting van 3,5% vir 2003  tot  3,9%  vir  2005  is  steeds  nie
genoeg nie. Die aansienlike bedrae wat aan maatskaplike  sorg  bestee  word,
dokter steeds maar net die simptome. Die oplossing  is  om  hoër  ekonomiese
groei en werkskepping te bewerkstellig en inflasie te  beveg  deur  'n  breë
strategie om beleggersvertroue te  skep  en  die  waarde  van  die  rand  te
beskerm.
Die  AEB  ondersteun  die   Minister   se   Mediumtermyn-bestedingsraamwerk.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker,  it  is  a  well-known  saying  that  the  less
attention a budget draws, the better it  is.  This  is  the  case  with  the
Minister's Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. There were no  big  surprises.
It should promote stability in the country because there  was  no  deviation
from previous years' fiscal discipline and this attests  to  good  planning,
management and control.

The AEB  welcomes  the  further  envisaged  tax  relief,  the  reduction  of
pressure on interest rates,  the  higher  growth  expectations  and  growth-
promoted extensions of Government spending. The additional R2  billion  next
year for the Justice sector, and also for the extra 5  000  members  of  the
Police Force per year is welcome, but is still far  too  little.  The  crime
disease in South Africa requires an emergency operation and not an aspirin.

 The AEB welcomes the relaxing of inflation targets  by  shifting  the  3-6%
target set for 2002-03 to 2003-04  and  abandoning  the  3-5%  target  until
2004. This adjustment in the inflation  target  can  relieve  the  immediate
pressure on interest rates and makes a further increase  in  interest  rates
for the year  unlikely.  The  recent  stabilisation  of  the  rand  and  the
reduction in the  price  of  crude  oil  could  contribute  to  the  targets
possibly being achieved.

The AEB requests a review of the simple policy of  interest  rate  increases
to combat inflation. Especially long-term loans,  such  as  mortgage  bonds,
must  be  excluded  from  further  interest  rate   increases.   Since   all
institutions which provide long-term financing are also active in the short-
term market, cross-subsidisation can easily take place.

The growth expectation of 3,5% for 2003  to  3,9%  for  2005  is  still  not
enough. The significant amounts which are spent on  social  care  are  still
only treating the symptoms. The  solution  is  to  achieve  higher  economic
growth and job creation and to fight inflation through a broad  strategy  to
create investor confidence and protect the value of the rand.

The AEB supports the Minister's Medium-Term Expenditure Framework.]

Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES:  Madam  Speaker,  millions  of  South  Africans  are
unemployed and destitute. One fifth  live  on  less  than  R10  a  day  and,
depending on which  poverty  line  is  used,  there  are  20  million  South
Africans living in poverty. Despite the Government's having  promised  jobs,
jobs, jobs, its policies have actually caused substantial  job  losses.  The
result is that in many parts of South Africa people are  starving,  in  some
cases to death.

While the obvious longer-term solution lies  in  policies  that  will  kick-
start economic growth, and therefore job  creation,  as  South  Africans  we
cannot sit back and allow our fellow  citizens  to  starve.   We  understand
that a basic income grant cannot eradicate  poverty,  but  it  can  help  to
alleviate poverty. A basic income grant will be able to  close  the  poverty
gap by 74% and effectively reach the 10-12 million  South  Africans  in  the
poorest households currently not  receiving  even  indirectly  any  form  of
social assistance.

The  DA  believes  in  a  caring  state  that  takes  action   to   generate
opportunity,  especially  for  the  disadvantaged.  A  basic  income   grant
financed and administered  in  a  responsible  manner,  and  implemented  in
conjunction with economic policies designed to  achieve  faster  growth,  is
exactly the kind of policy a DA government  would  implement.  Our  research
has  proved  that  the  grant  can  be  sustainably  financed  and  can   be
administered  without  the  state  having   to   set   up   new,   expensive
bureaucracies.

But now, how does the Minister of Finance  respond  to  the  plight  of  the
poor? He calls  the  basic  income  grant,  and  I  quote,  ``unashamed  and
unaffordable populism'', ``not a viable  proposal''  and  ``macropopulism''.
Frankly, while the Minister is good for free grapes and speeches  in  iambic
pentameter, his response and the ANC's response to the implementation  of  a
basic income grant is downright disgusting. What is  truly  illustrative  of
the ANC's attitude is that we can afford a R600 million luxury jet  for  the
President but we cannot give the poorest of the  poor  R110  a  month.  That
says it all.

The Minister has lost touch with the people; he has forgotten where he  came
from; he has let the people down. [Applause.]

Mr D A HANEKOM: Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  let  us  not
respond to the last speaker. He just spoilt it for us. I would  not  respond
to that because it is not  worth  it.  It  has  been  a  very  good  debate.
[Applause.]

It is very difficult to speak on this budget that we have in  front  of  us,
the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, because so much  has  already  been
said. So let me talk a little bit about our dreams. We all have  dreams  and
aspirations. We dream of many things. [Interjections.] Yes, even  those  who
are shouting have dreams. We dream of a better  world,  and  we  should.  We
dream of a world without war. We dream of a world in which there  is  peace,
a world without poverty, a world without underdevelopment.  We  dream  of  a
cleaner environment, safe streets where we can go for  walks.  We  dream  of
parks where our children can play without  our  being  worried  about  their
safety. We dream about these things. Martin Luther King  was  not  the  only
person in the world with dreams. The reason that his  much-acclaimed  speech
so resonated amongst many people was that he gave expression to  the  dreams
that ordinary people have.

 In a more immediate sense we have other dreams and aspirations:  the  dream
of a rural woman to have, one day, a fridge or running water in  her  house,
to be able, one day, to provide a decent  meal  for  the  family.  It  is  a
modest dream, but it is a dream that she has and  it  is  a  very  important
dream.

The Budget is about the fulfilment of those dreams. Even these  very  modest
dreams make up our vision for our country. The Budget we are  discussing  is
all about the needs of that woman, and the needs of many of our people  that
we are expected to fulfil. The Budget  and  the  accompanying  measures  and
programmes represent the most powerful tool  we  have  at  our  disposal  to
address these dreams and aspirations, to make them become a reality  and  to
ensure that the basic needs of our people are met in a sustainable way.

The Budget is essentially about improving  the  lives  of  millions  of  our
people. The school uniforms that we have to buy next year for  our  children
are something that we immediately think about. In the backs of the minds  of
many members who are  sitting  here  are  worries  about  everyday  economic
realities that have to be faced: the servicing of the car that may  have  to
be done next year or next month, the holiday that is possible being  planned
for the end of the year. When we go to the ATM we  might  see  a  sign  that
worries us: it reads ``insufficient funds'', and that is  a  horrible  thing
to see.

Well clearly, in order to fulfil the  aspirations  of  our  people  we  need
money, just as, in order to service a car, one needs money. For most  of  us
we are talking about a few hundred rand or maybe a couple of  thousand  rand
at the most. The good Minister here has rather a big family to provide  for.
In fact, there are over 40 million people that are his  responsibility.  The
Budget  is  not  about  the  allocation  of  funds  to  Ministries  and  the
departments. It is about satisfying the legitimate needs of millions of  our
people. And to do this properly a lot of money is needed.

Economics should not be just for economists. It affects our everyday  lives.
The Minister is dealing next year with a Budget of over R300  billion.  This
is a very big sum of money. Most of us do not even know how many noughts  go
behind this R300. I am sure Trevor himself is intimidated and cannot  really
comprehend what this means, and that is why he  has  such  a  good  team  of
people around him. It is a lot of money and it has to  be  spent  well,  and
that is what this Budget is about.

I think it is important for us just to have  some  sense  of  where  we  are
going, some sense of our economy. What we heard as a  budget  committee  was
not a thumbsuck; there were presentations from, in very  many  cases,  quite
conservative economists. The  prediction  of  economic  growth  is  a  sound
prediction supported by all of the people that made presentations to us.  We
have forecasts of 3,5% growth in 2003 - this is good news  -  3,7%  in  2004
and 3,9% in 2005.

Inflation has been a problem, but  from  every  single  person  who  made  a
presentation there was optimism that inflation would  come  down.  There  is
absolute optimism. The forecasts that we  have  in  the  Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement indicate that in the final quarter of  next  year  we  will
bring inflation down to below 6%. In 2004, we are  confident  that  it  will
fall within the 3-6% range. Real expenditure, real spending on those  things
that we need so desperately is increasing, and 6,7% is the increase  in  the
amount of money that will be available for social  spending.  That  makes  a
real difference in respect of the kinds of things that we are  able  to  do.
Revenue in 2001-02 grew by 15%. That is really impressive.

Now, in our everyday constituency work we will be confronted by a number  of
important questions. People will ask us what we  are  doing  about  HIV  and
Aids. We must familiarise ourselves  as  members  of  Parliament  with  this
Budget that we have in front of us. We must be able to say that we have  now
provided for a massive increase in the spending on  HIV  and  Aids,  a  R3,3
billion boost over the next three years.

People will say to hon members: What  about  crime?  How  are  we  going  to
improve our country? Has enough money been allocated to crime?  We  must  be
able to give people information. We heard submissions from the police  force
indicating that over the next three years 16 000 people  will  be  recruited
and trained to boost the performance of the police.  The  courts  are  being
improved. Prisons are being  built,  maintained  and  improved.  This  whole
integrated justice sector is using the money that has  been  made  available
to them to ensure that we are able to live in  a  safer  environment.  Those
are real things that are improving.

But while we are doing this - and this is  perhaps  the  really  good  news,
because it represents increased spending - we  are  continuing  to  build  a
solid foundation for future growth. Money is being spent  on  infrastructure
and on education and training  to  ensure  that  we  have  sustained  future
economic growth. This is the result of good economic management.

It is very difficult to believe, but while we are doing  all  of  this,  the
deficit is going down at the same time,  and  it  is  not  being  done  with
higher taxes. Yes, we are improving on our tax collection  performance,  but
the main thing is that what we have in front of us is good,  sound  economic
management, improved tax collection, economic growth and responsible  fiscal
management. That results not only in increased spending immediately in  this
three-year period that we are looking at, but  also  in  sustained  economic
growth and sustained increased spending.

Possibly the only thing that we can report to the hon the Minister,  because
there was a lot of consensus amongst those who did  presentations,  is  that
there was consensus amongst most who made presentations to us that there  is
room for further fiscal expansion. This is something that we have  to  think
about very carefully. Performance has been very good, but there  is  clearly
a dire and pressing need to deliver on the needs  of  our  people,  and  the
economists that made presentations to us all feel that  there  is  room  for
fiscal expansion.

I would like to say that this committee was very  fortunate  to  be  led  by
somebody like Nhlanhla Nene,  who  has  proved  to  be  a  very,  very  good
chairperson of this committee. I think he has done an excellent job. We  are
immensely proud of Minister Manuel, his Deputy Minister and  his  team.  The
whole country has confidence in our economy.

We believe that, the way we are going now, these dreams  that  we  have  can
and will become a reality. Our challenge now is to  translate  these  dreams
into ideas and practical programmes so that even we, when we go back to  our
constituencies, can think of things that we can do  to  make  the  lives  of
ordinary people better. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  let  me  start  by
expressing my sincere appreciation to the hon Nene and the  members  of  the
budget committee. They were given an unenviable task, convened right on  the
eve of the tabling of the Medium-Term Budget  Policy  Statement  and  set  a
task.  I  would  like  to  believe  that  they  have  acquitted   themselves
exceedingly well, given the circumstances.

However, what is important going forward is that  the  budget  committee  is
involved in a process that assists us in shaping  the  Budget.  So  I  would
like to appeal for permanence for this committee and ask that they live  out
their  terms  of  reference,  including  providing  inputs  into   portfolio
committees on a  regular  basis  gleaned  from  the  expenditure  trends  as
reported in terms of the PFMA.

I would also  like  to  express  my  appreciation  to  all  members  of  the
committee who spoke in this debate. Before dealing with  the  issues  raised
directly, let me share  some  good  news  with  the  House  this  afternoon.
Standard & Poor's  rating  agency  has  upgraded  South  Africa.  They  have
changed the outlook from stable to positive. [Applause.] They  did  so  this
morning  using  two  sets  of  criteria:  firstly,  the  persistently  sound
macroeconomic management and policies, and secondly,  a  readily  manageable
and declining debt burden which has helped the country  weather  periods  of
high currency volatility.

Hon members may or may not be aware that  all  three  rating  agencies  have
given us upgrades as a country during the past  12  months  ...  [Applause.]
... Moody's in November last year, Fitch in  August  and  today  Standard  &
Poor's. That, certainly, is good news, and I think  it  speaks  volumes  for
the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement and the issues that we have  already
heard about in the debate this afternoon.

In respect of some of the issues dealt with, and recognising that input  was
sought from a number of private-sector economists, let us  remind  ourselves
that economics is a dismal science. It is very hard to  reach  agreement  on
these issues. I think  that  members,  especially  those  in  the  Portfolio
Committee on Finance, would know that we, as the  Treasury,  do  not  change
our minds very often. We make two calls: one at the time of the  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement and the other when we table the Budget, and we  live
by that. Private-sector economists, especially those in big banks, have  the
luxury of changing their minds three times a day, so  let  us  examine  what
they offer within that context.

The hon Woods spoke about  falling  exports,  and  when  one  looks  at  the
detail, I think  it  is  important  to  recognise  the  changing  basket  of
exports. Clearly, we are already starting to see some of the  resource-based
exports come down and against that the enormous breakthroughs  that  we  are
continuing to make in higher-tech industries. So there  are  trade-offs  and
the value is certainly at the higher end, and  this  is  something  that  we
clearly have to  watch going forward.

A number of members have spoken about inflation and  the  inflation  target.
Let me restate this afternoon that price  stability  is  in  our  collective
interest. I think workers and investors alike need to take inflation out  of
the equation, be it in wage bargaining or investment  decisions.  That  kind
of stability provides a certainty which will be important for growth.

It is a fact that north and  south  of  the  equator  inflationary  outlooks
differ, with the G-7 countries facing a deflationary  environment  while  in
the south inflation still continues to be in the order of magnitude that  we
are now living through. Of course, there is a lot of light  at  the  end  of
the tunnel.  There  is  broad  consensus  now  that  especially  food  price
inflation will come down over the next 12 months, and that certainly  augurs
well for the lives of poor people in our country.

In respect of the estimates, especially on the revenue, clearly we  need  to
remain cautious about that, and not without reason. Looking at  the  details
of the changes that we have announced in  the  R8,1  billion  increase,  the
first issue is that VAT  is  higher  than  expected,  and  that  is  largely
inflation-driven with no fall-off in consumer spending. Secondly,  corporate
taxes  have  increased  by  R500  million,  largely  because   of   improved
efficiencies. Thirdly, secondary tax on companies is  up  by  R700  million.
And then, because of higher than expected wage  settlements,  there  is  the
whopping R2,6 billion from personal income taxes. Those  trends  are  likely
to be there in an environment which is as uncertain as  that  which  we  are
living through, given global uncertainties and the impact  of  inflation  on
our domestic economy.

Dr Koornhof and others spoke about infrastructure, and I  think  we  broadly
agree that it needs a boost. Part of what  members  did  not  comment  on  -
because I can well accept that in two minutes there is  not  much  that  one
can say  - is that the increases to other spheres of government,  especially
to  local  government,  do  account  for  an  additional   R1   billion   of
infrastructure spending.

Optimally, I think a public works programme might prove to  work  better  if
managed through  local  authorities.  That,  together  with  local  economic
development, is likely to assist the process. Some of these  small  projects
are very difficult to manage from the national  level.  In  fact,  sometimes
consultants'  fees  are  more  than  the  cost  of  the  project.  So  local
authorities need to be brought  into  play.  Salga  is  holding  a  national
general council meeting, and this  is  one  of  the  issues  that  they  are
talking through during these days.

There is an issue on the expenditure side that  I  perhaps  had  hoped  that
members would have touched on, and that relates to facilities.  In  many  of
our larger facilities, especially tertiary hospitals, what we are seeing  is
a failure to manage. We are reading daily in the newspapers  about  machines
breaking down, linen disappearing, no light bulbs and all of those kinds  of
issues. Generally, it is not as a result of an insufficiency of finance.  It
is as a result of a failure to manage these institutions.

Together with the Department  of  Health  and  the  provinces,  we  are  now
introducing an IT  facilities  management  system  that  will  allow  better
reporting and better maintenance of equipment so that we do not  have  these
kinds of breakdowns. But between now and the tabling of  the  Budget  on  26
February 2003, I think these issues  are  likely  to  be  drawn  into  sharp
relief again.

Perhaps the key issue - and I draw this from what a number  of  contributors
to the debate said - is what kind of state  we  want.  Clearly,  the  caring
needs  to  be  demonstrated  in  the  content  of  development,  and  so   a
developmental state is one that must be identified from  the  fiscal  stance
it takes: how much we borrow  and  how  much  we  spend;  how  much  capital
expenditure there is to facilitate growth  for  tomorrow  against  how  much
consumption expenditure there is. There is no quick fix, there is no  silver
bullet; there has to be continuous engagement in this process.
We have heard from the  private  sector  and  from  contributors  here  that
perhaps our Budget is not sufficiently expansionary. I challenge anybody  to
look at the 6,7% real growth for the first year. The Budget which  we  table
on 26 February next year is premised on 6,7% real growth. I cannot  see  the
public sector absorbing substantially more than that. So  when  people  take
these  labels  so  graciously  and   freely   provided   by   private-sector
economists, let us also look at those kinds of issues.

Let me conclude by saying that I heard an interesting point this  afternoon.
I heard about a DA government. Well,  a  camel  has  more  chance  of  going
through the eye of a needle than the  DA  has  of  governing  South  Africa.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (First Reading debate)
Ms B A HOGAN: Deputy Speaker, I have before me  the  Adjusted  Estimates  of
National Expenditure. It is a comprehensive book and a welcome  change  from
the way that the National Treasury presented the  adjustments  estimates  in
the past.

Before us here  we  have  every  department  spelling  out  how  it  intends
changing its budget. It is clear and transparent, and it  is  a  great  pity
that here in Parliament we have not had sufficient time to pay attention  to
the detail that is carried in the document. It is for  this  reason  that  I
want to congratulate Parliament on setting up a Joint  Budget  Committee.  I
wish to convey my good wishes to the chairs of that committee, Mr  Nene  and
Mr Ralane, and to its members, because they are indeed  going  to  be  faced
with the formidable task of transforming this institution, Parliament,  into
an institution that performs effective, wise and  good  oversight  over  the
executive, using the Budget as a basis for that oversight.

It is an ambitious project, a project that Mr Hanekom might say  is  one  of
the dreams that those of us who take oversight seriously in this  Parliament
have dreamt for  many,  many  years.  I  wish  to  thank  the  Treasury  for
producing documents of this calibre and transparency and accessibility  over
the years, even though we as Parliament have never had  the  opportunity  to
engage properly with these documents.

The process I would imagine next  year  is  that  when,  for  instance,  the
Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement  is  tabled,  the  Budget   committee
simultaneously  deals  with  these  adjustments  estimates,  so  that  every
department appearing before the Budget committee would at one time speak  to
its medium-term forward estimates and the adjustments  estimates.  Maybe  my
dream is a bit bigger. Maybe my dream says that we  would  also  have  Scopa
members there, sitting jointly with that Budget committee, and we  would  be
looking at the report that Scopa makes on each Government department,  using
that too as a basis for examining the work that the department is doing  and
the output that it is  achieving.  It  is  only  in  this  way  -  when  the
legislature, Parliament, comes into partnership with the  executive  -  that
we can start getting real value for money, that we can start  ensuring  that
the money that the Government appropriates  for  its  work  reaches,  as  my
colleague Mr Nene said, those for whom it is intended.

I wish the Budget committee a great deal of success. It  will  be  a  trying
time for those who have even begun to scratch the surface of what  it  would
mean to alter the Budget process here in  Parliament,  to  make  it  a  more
effective process, to make this Parliament a debating forum  -  not  just  a
place where we pass Bills regularly and talk  formally,  but  one  where  we
debate the issues underlying that. For  instance,  the  DA  has  tabled  its
views on the basic income grant. These things need to be  debated.  We  need
to be talking about the best possible way of going forward in providing  for
this country and its people. So let me say to Mr Nene and Mr Ralane that  it
is with great joy that I see that their committee has been appointed  and  I
look forward to engaging with it in seeing if we  can  improve  this  Budget
process.

Briefly, what are the adjustments estimates  about?  We  pass  a  Budget  in
February, and what we do in  October  is  fine-tune  that  Budget.  We  say,
``This is not as we anticipated, this is what  has  got  to  be  fine-tuned,
this  is  what  happened  that  we  did  not  expect  and  these   are   the
adjustments.'' It does not allow us to change the basic Budget.

The adjustments estimates only cater for very specific instances of  change,
and let me go through them very quickly. Firstly, what may  be  allowed  are
significant unforeseeable economic and financial events, and we see this  in
the Budget with the adjustments for inflation. We have  an  amount  of  over
R3,4 billion which is going to adjust for inflation.

It allows for unforeseeable  -  not  unforeseen,  but  unforeseeable  -  and
unavoidable expenditure. For instance, not one of us could have  anticipated
what  the  expenditures  would  be  for  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development, and that  is  an  instance  of  unforeseeable  expenditure.  It
allows for any funds required for emergency situations. We  are  looking  at
food relief at the moment, and emergencies are obviously unforeseeable.

Then there is money that is to be appropriated and  that  has  already  been
announced by the Minister. One must note that often in a Budget  Speech  the
Minister makes mention of certain  expenditures  which  have  not  yet  been
allocated  because  they  are  dependent  on   certain   agreements.   These
expenditures relate this year to infrastructural grants,  and  now  we  know
what the full impact of those infrastructural grants is going to be.

Then we have a very important item which we  ourselves  put  in  the  Public
Finance Management Act, and that is virement. Departments  are  not  allowed
to shift between their spending categories or  between  departments  without
the approval of Parliament, and that is where we have to come in and say  we
agree that the shifting of expenditures can occur.

Then, of course, there is the  utilisation  of  savings,  how  that  can  be
reallocated, and the roll-over of unspent funds. Let me say that  roll-overs
have become far less of a contentious issue than they were in the past,  and
I want to congratulate the executive on improving that situation.

With that I commend  these  adjustments  estimates  to  Parliament  for  its
approval, and I thank you, Madam Speaker, for  the  opportunity  to  address
the House. I commend the House for setting up  the  Joint  Budget  Committee
and I wish it well in its endeavours. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker and hon members, the Adjustments  Appropriation
Bill before us increases the estimated expenditure level by R3,8 billion,  a
relatively modest increase given the inflationary pressures present  in  the
South African economy during this period.

Despite the clear inflation question, the  adjustments  do  aim  to  address
poverty and  rightly  emphasise  considerable  social  need  in  a  fiscally
responsible manner. The Bill provides for an additional R2  billion  social-
delivery-targeted equitable share allocation  for  the  provinces  aimed  at
catering for the extensive take-up rate  of  social  grants.  The  increased
take-up rate for social grants is a clear indication  of  the  need  for  an
affordable social security net to be set up as  a  matter  of  urgency.  The
comments made by my colleague in an earlier  debate  would  have  a  bearing
here.

From comments by the Department  of  Social  Development  before  the  Joint
Budget Committee, it became clear that  in  relation  to  the  R400  million
provided for food relief through the adjusted estimate process, there is  no
clarity  on,  firstly,  which  Government  department  would  be  the   lead
department to ensure delivery in the crucial  area  and/or,  secondly,  what
mode  this  delivery  would  take,  be  it  food   vouchers,   direct   food
distribution or whichever other mode might be available to  Government.  For
the  modest  relief  to  be  effective,   and   efficiently   targeted   and
distributed, these questions must be addressed and resolved speedily.

As is clear from the report to the House  on  this  Bill  by  the  Portfolio
Committee on Finance, a number  of  areas  of  concern  emerged  during  the
consideration of  the  Bill.  Firstly,  in  relation  to  the  Vote  of  the
Department of Transport,  the  lifetime  contracts  in  both  rail  and  bus
commuter services raised concern  due  to  the  escalation  clauses  in  the
contracts.

 In relation to the Department of Public Works, concern was  expressed  that
the National Treasury had not funded the  department  for  it  to  be  in  a
position to discharge  all  its  legal  obligations  for  rental  and  lease
agreements. The  National  Treasury  indicated  that  this  was  a  form  of
bringing pressure to bear on the department, but surely this must not be  in
a  context  where  the  department  is  forced  into  abdicating  its  legal
obligations.

Another department that raised concern was  clearly  Home  Affairs  and  the
roll-out of the Hanis project, which was  based  on  an  estimated  exchange
rate of R6 against US$1. This raised concern, as the committee  pointed  out
in its report, due to the cost increases for the contract.

In the  arena  of  HIV  and  Aids  prevention  -  these  are  concerns,  not
criticism, and Trevor can handle that - Government ought to have known  that
its  constant  and   stubborn   abdication   of   its   responsibility   for
socioeconomic rights delivery in this area would inevitably result in  court
action and that the principles underpinning such litigation  would  win  not
only a moral victory but also its day in court. The R5 million allocated  to
the Department of Health to cover legal costs  in  the  TAC  case  therefore
cannot be seen as unforeseeable expenditure. In  addition,  the  paltry  R50
million adjusted allocation to  the  HIV  and  Aids  grant  to  provide  for
Cabinet's decision following the Constitutional  Court  action  is  woefully
inadequate.

The PFMA allows for appropriations that are  unforeseeable  or  unavoidable.
The DA believes that a number of the  allocations  before  the  House  today
that purport to be unforeseeable or unavoidable  are  merely  unforeseen.  A
rigorous engagement is  required  between  the  National  Treasury  and  the
relevant departments to ensure that it  is  not  merely  bad  planning  that
results  in  these  categories  of  expenditure  and  that  they  are  truly
unforeseeable and unavoidable.

This is clearly an area of fertile ground for the new  Budget  committee  to
interrogate  -  whether  or  not  expenditure  going  through  an   adjusted
appropriation process is indeed unforeseeable and  unavoidable,  or  whether
it is a judgment call that  would  see  such  expenditure  as  merely  being
unforeseen.

I would further like to associate myself quite strongly  with  the  comments
that were made by the hon Barbara Hogan in relation to  the  future  of  the
Joint Budget Committee and the formidable challenge  that  confronts  it  in
growing a role for Parliament in the  budgetary  process.  I  wish  the  two
chairpersons all strength in that process because it  is  indeed  a  process
that requires both urgent attention and our commitment.

The DA supports the Adjustments Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS:  Chairperson,  we  have  studied  the  various  categories  of
adjustments proposed in the Bill and, to concur with the hon Barbara  Hogan,
we too found Treasury's publication of the Adjusted  Estimates  of  National
Expenditure to be very helpful in this  regard.  In  fact,  in  almost  each
instance we found sufficient information for us  to  decide  on  whether  we
felt the individual adjustments to be acceptable or not.

In the category of roll-overs we also found an improving  situation  and  in
theory we see the situation improving further as the strategic planning  and
the PFMA regime bed down fully in  all  Government  departments,  with  more
considered spending of money and better use within the required  periods  of
time. I think that roll-overs, as we once saw  them,  will  therefore  never
repeat themselves.

There is also no contention surrounding the virement  activities,  as  these
appear to conform with the PFMA parameters. A lot of these virement  changes
and shifts were very interesting, but in that it was a  case  of  Government
taking the licence granted to them by the  Public  Finance  Management  Act.
With everything conforming to that, we have no problems there either.

I think we can say the same from the information we see in  the  publication
concerning the supplementary infrastructure allocations,  announced  in  the
Budget earlier this year, coming into being by way of adjustment.  There  is
the inflation adjustment, which  has  already  been  referred  to,  and  the
provision for food relief, which is very necessary.

This really leaves us with that expenditure category of R3,4  billion  which
is known as ``unforeseeable  and  unavoidable  incidents  of  expenditure''.
Only in this area do we possibly have a few questions. We did try  to  raise
some of these questions with Treasury officials in the  Portfolio  Committee
on Finance. I think they did their  best  when  we  quizzed  them,  but  the
chairperson of that  committee  made  the  obvious  point  that  somehow  we
perhaps need to get the actual departments before the committee to ask  them
in detail, as it is not really fair to ask Treasury officials in  a  second-
hand fashion to explain the deeper reasons for some of these adjustments.

On  this  occasion,  rather  than  to   cherry-pick   instances   of   these
unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditures, the main  issues  are  going  to
come up in the session that follows in about half an hour's  time,  when  we
have this really unique occasion in this House - which I know we  are  going
to utilise well - where we as MPs have the executive here in front of us  to
account to us. I am sure these issues are going to come up.

The IFP will therefore support the Bill and we look forward to the  question
and answer session just now.

Dr P J RABIE: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister en agb  lede  van  die  Raad,
hierdie wetsontwerp bewillig aangesuiwerde bedrae  geld  vir  die  behoeftes
van die staat ten opsigte van die boekjaar wat op 21 Maart 2003 eindig.  [Mr
Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members  of  the  House,  this   Bill
appropriates additional amounts of money for the requirements of  the  state
with regard to the financial year ending on 21 March 2003.]

I will briefly refer to  provincial  and  local  government.  In  the  Joint
Budget Committee we had extensive hearings over the past  two  weeks  and  I
would like to start with social grants. These will continue to  be  adjusted
to compensate for  inflation.  What  is  of  importance,  however,  is  that
Government  continues   the   emphasis   on   capacity-building,   municipal
infrastructure and access to free basic water and electricity.

When I studied the  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill  I  thought  about  the
Financial and Fiscal  Commission's  proposals  regarding  local  government,
namely that the creditworthiness of some municipalities with  little  access
to debt must be extended by means of infrastructure grants. I think this  is
a very important form of assistance from the national  Government.  What  is
of concern to me,  however,  is  that  the  clear  demarcation  between  the
functions  of  local  and  district  municipalities  regarding   electricity
distribution and other  services  must  be  made  timeously.  This  is  very
important. It is one of the functions  of  the  Joint  Budget  Committee  to
demarcate this particular division.

My considered opinion is that local government  should,  in  the  long  run,
deliver services to residents. The proposal of the FFC  that  a  legal  base
should  be  established  to  enable  contingency  reserves  to   accommodate
disaster management is also very important. This should also be included  by
means of the enactment of legislation as soon as possible. The fact is  that
empirical evidence reflects that 89% of municipal revenue is collected  from
own resources. However, the catch in this is that  most  of  this  money  is
collected by metropolitan local authorities. What is of concern  is  that  a
number of rural and district councils depend  upon  grants  and  funds  from
national Government. I think that national  Government  should  be  able  to
help these particular authorities  to  become  financially  independent.  It
will be quite a challenge, especially for the national  Government  and  the
legislatures, to assist these particular institutions  to  attain  financial
independence.

Home Affairs was also given a fair amount  of  attention  during  the  Joint
Budget Committee hearings. The fact  was  mentioned  that  the  delivery  of
civic affair functions  to  municipalities  to  enable  citizens  to  obtain
identification documents, registration of birth certificates  and  so  forth
is being investigated. They are thinking of delegating this to  these  local
authorities. I think that will also help  people  in  rural  areas  to  gain
access to this assistance, which is extremely important.

In the Adjustments Appropriation Bill, R44,967 million is budgeted  in  Home
Affairs regarding migration. During  the  Budget  hearings  the  Centre  for
Illegal Aliens was mentioned and  the  question  was  posed  by  the  Budget
committee as to whether this centre was functioning and managing  to  assist
migrants coming into South Africa. Illegal immigrants are now  migrating  in
increasing numbers to South Africa. I am concerned that,  during  the  Joint
Budget Committee hearings, we were told that 1 100  posts  in  Home  Affairs
remain vacant. I think we  will  have  to  address  this  particular  issue,
because it is impossible to render an  effective  service  if  that  is  the
number of vacancies. It is a particular challenge to all  role-players  that
we fill these vacancies in a timeous manner.

The New NP supports this Bill and we will go into  further  detail  shortly,
when we have some questions to ask.

Mr B A MNGUNI: Chairperson, hon members, the  hon  Barbara  Hogan  mentioned
the roll-overs. I just want  to  concentrate  on  roll-overs  for  a  little
while. What are roll-overs? These are funds that could not be  spent  during
the year in  which  they  were  appropriated  and  are  taken  over  to  the
following year. Now in these estimates the roll-overs  total  R1,2  billion.
Compared to last year and looking  at  the  current  figures  of  the  total
Budget of this year, it is only 0,4% of the  total  Budget.  If  there  were
more roll-overs, politically people would say that the Government  does  not
deliver and does not spend and that there  is  no  efficiency  or  there  is
incapacity in departments.

If we study the roll-overs in this estimate, we discover the opposite to  be
true. We find that most of the roll-overs in  these  estimates  are  due  to
technical or logistical problems. In Defence, for example, four out of  five
roll-overs are due to the late delivery or nondelivery of invoices. That  is
not the fault of Government but is due to service providers.

Looking at land restitution, I hope we are all aware  of  the  problem  this
department is facing of negotiating with buyers and sellers on  that  basis.
The department cannot ride roughshod over people who are  supposed  to  sell
their land to previously disadvantaged people, and the funds  allocated  for
such projects cannot just be forfeited because  the  funds  were  not  spent
during the timeframe of that year.

However, we  are  not  justifying  such  roll-overs.  We  should  thank  the
National Treasury for introducing the  Vulindlela  project,  which  monitors
the expenditure patterns of departments,  including  roll-overs  themselves.
The department needs  to  be  commended  for  doing  such  a  sterling  job.
However, it needs to tighten the screws a bit so  that  unjustifiable  roll-
overs are prevented.

The R3,4 billion on the adjustments is  due  to  inflation  adjustments.  We
should be proud that the South African economy is as  resilient  to  outside
shocks as expected. Most developing countries are not as resilient  to  such
outside shocks. South Africa has proved that, though  small  and  having  an
emerging economy, it has performed quite well as far as the  global  economy
is concerned. Despite inflationary pressures due to  outside  shocks,  South
Africa performed much better with the result that R3,4  billion  has  to  be
allocated to accommodate inflation.

We heard in the previous debate on the Medium-Term Budget  Policy  Statement
that food prices are mainly responsible for  increasing  inflation.  Besides
food prices, there are other goods and services essential for Government  to
deliver that are actually also responsible for inflation.

With regard to  the  international  arena,  South  Africa  is  participating
globally in all forums and spheres. When one looks into the  estimates,  one
sees that there is R172 000 that has been adjusted due  to  donor  funds  or
some prizes that we won from all these forums. That  proves  our  competency
as we participate more in these world forums.

I just want to refer to what Ms Taljaard said, namely that the R3,3  billion
inflation might be due to Government's failure to  curb  inflation.  On  the
contrary, she should be aware that in any economy where  there  are  outside
shocks there are bound to be secondary effects.  One  cannot  say  that  the
department or the Ministry is  failing  just  because  there  is  that  R3,3
billion allocated to inflation. It is a fact that any economy  is  bound  to
have secondary effects. [Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Mr Chairperson, hon members, two  important  issues  should
be raised with regard to the Adjustments Appropriation  Bill:  firstly,  the
report of the Portfolio Committee on Finance on  this  Bill  and,  secondly,
the R400 million per annum allocated for emergency food relief.

I hope that members of this House have read the  short  but  very  important
report of the portfolio committee on this Bill, published in the ATCs  on  7
November 2002.  In  this  report  the  portfolio  committee  highlights  its
concern with three of the Votes contained in the Bill,  and  I  fully  align
myself with the concerns raised.

The first is Vote No  4  -  Home  Affairs,  regarding  which  the  portfolio
committee expressed its concern that the exchange rate on which  a  contract
was budgeted did not cover the cost of equipment and services for  the  Home
Affairs National Identification System project, or Hanis. This represents  a
major blunder and should have been anticipated. The amount is R157 million.

The second is Vote No 6 -  Public  Works.  Concern  is  expressed  that  the
contractual obligations are not budgeted for in the Medium-Term  Expenditure
Framework. It is suggested that the escalation costs of the rental or  lease
agreements should be revisited. The value here is R172 million.

The third is  Vote  No  32  -  Transport.  Concern  is  expressed  that  the
escalators in contracts of both bus  and  rail  services  are  unaffordable.
Both these modes of transport have lifelong contracts. The  amount  involved
here is R200 million.

In all three Votes referred to  above  the  expenditure  was  classified  as
unforeseeable and unavoidable.  This  should  be  a  real  concern  for  the
National Treasury.

In conclusion, the Minister and the National Treasury  should  be  commended
for the initiative to ask for an  unallocated  R400  million  per  year  for
emergency food relief. We want to recommend to  the  Minister  that  serious
attention or consideration be given to the  introduction  of  a  food  stamp
system in South Africa by which target groups in the poorest section of  our
society can be effectively assisted. Such a system can easily be  linked  to
an incentive scheme to also help in the upliftment of  poor  communities  in
our country.

We also want to align ourselves  with  the  remarks  by  the  chair  of  the
portfolio committee,  Ms  Barbara  Hogan,  and  we  wish  the  Joint  Budget
Committee every success  in  their  deliberations  in  the  next  couple  of
months.

The UDM supports the Adjustments Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, one area that affects adjustment measures is  the
volatility of our economy, which makes it difficult  to  adequately  predict
and sustain a stable rand-dollar value.  South  Africa's  economy  needs  to
stabilise in order to sustain a more reasonable  adjustment  policy.  It  is
not  a  feasible  practice  when  departments  calculate   their   budgetary
requirements without having clear guidelines as  to  inflationary  measures.
In certain instances huge adjustments  had  to  be  made  to  keep  up  with
unexpected costs.

It is also unacceptable to realise at a very late stage that the  Department
of Home Affairs used an exchange rate of R6 to US$1 for the Hanis  contract.
If this is an oversight then it surely cost the taxpayer a lot of  money  to
rectify the matter. In fact, we must state the position  in  economic  terms
as a loss to the state and negative tax burden borne by the taxpayer.

The ACDP thinks that the sooner we start measuring cost in terms  of  losses
and gains, instead of roll-overs and adjustments, the  greater  the  ability
to determine the productivity and performance of certain  state  departments
will be. In the Health budget the state had to adjust  an  amount  of  about
R15 million to provide antiretroviral drugs to rape survivors. It  then  had
to pay legal costs of R5 million for its case against  the  Treatment Action
Campaign. These costs should also be referred to as losses in a real  sense.


If Government had not supported an  outdated  health  policy,  much  of  the
costs incurred now for antiretrovirals might have  been  better  spent  with
consequent cheaper outcomes, instead of going  the  route  of  court  action
while incurring legal costs  simply  to  be  told  to  roll  out  funds  for
medication. The loss carried by the taxpayer should be calculated  in  terms
of the rise in inflation, deaths, and health and  welfare  costs  which  the
state had to pay because of late interventionary measures.

 In conclusion, the  ACDP  supports  this  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill.
[Applause.]

[Ms L MABE: Chairperson, firstly I would like to say, as South  Africans  we
should not forget that we are Africans, we are not in  America  and  we  are
not in Europe. At times people say  that  the  Government  of  South  Africa
wastes funds. They say that we should not go to the DRC, and we  should  not
go to Burundi. We should  not  listen  to  these  people  because  they  are
misleading us. These people are misleading us. They make us forget  that  we
are Africans, and that we are South Africans.]

The  Minister  of  Finance  tabled  the  Adjusted  Estimates   of   National
Expenditure in the National Assembly for Parliament  to  approve  and  adopt
the revised spending plans of the executive. The adjusted estimates  include
the allocations for unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditure.

Unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditure is expenditure that could  not  be
anticipated at the time when the  submissions  were  made  to  Treasury  and
therefore could not be  accommodated  in  the  Budget  by  the  Minister  of
Finance at that particular time. Those expenditures cannot be financed  from
savings or, at the same time, from the reprioritisation of programmes.

During the  course  of  the  year  departments  face  situations  that  need
additional funding and could not  be  predicted,  as  I  indicated,  in  the
Budget in February 2002. It is a fact that any responsible government  would
adjust its budget estimates when faced with challenges  that  could  not  be
foreseen at the time when it passed its budget. Some  of  these  adjustments
are unforeseeable economic and financial events that face us as  a  country,
and we need to respond to those situations.

As Africans we have an obligation to develop  an  interest  and  participate
actively  in  issues  of  Africa.  Some  people  regard  Africa  as  a  dark
continent, but it is time that we showed them that  Africa  is  not  a  dark
continent, because those who reside in Africa like it,  just  as  those  who
reside in Europe like Europe.
South Africa hosted the inaugural summit of the  African  Union,  which  was
attended by an unexpectedly large number of heads of  state  because  nobody
expected that many African countries would be  members  of  the  AU  at  the
particular time of its launching.

South  Africa  assumed  the  responsibilities  for  the  implementation  and
monitoring  of  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo   conflict   resolution
agreement. Armed conflict in any  African  country  affects  us  negatively,
whether we like it or not. One  cannot  precisely  predict  how  long  armed
conflict negotiations will last and the necessary spending related  to  such
negotiations. A good example is our Kempton Park negotiations,  which  posed
serious challenges  to  us  as  a  country  and  which  lasted  longer  than
expected.

An additional amount of R118 million has been allocated for  the  Department
of Home Affairs to meet the contractual obligations of  the  Hanis  project.
This adjustment results from unanticipated exchange rate movements when  the
value of the rand depreciated and the  price  escalation  of  equipment  and
services.

An amount of R2 billion is allocated to provinces for  unavoidable  spending
resulting from rapid growth  in  the  numbers  of  beneficiaries  of  social
grants and to provide for learner support material  before  the  new  school
year.

The 17 April 2002 announcement by  Cabinet  on  the  implementation  of  the
HIV/Aids policies and programmes is another unavoidable expenditure  because
nobody expected that announcement at  that  particular  time.  Spending  was
inevitable in order to provide funding for  the  treatment  policy  and  the
mother-to-child transmission programme. Also  unavoidable  was  the  funding
required in KwaZulu-Natal to  defray  expenditure  incurred  to  combat  the
cholera epidemic. Therefore ...

[... I would like to say that it is important that we understand  that  when
we talk about money at this time of the year, it shows that it is  important
for this Government at the moment to  make  everybody  understand  and  know
what the Government is doing with the money, and that we should  not  change
Parliament without giving the Minister and other  Ministers  the  permission
that, that should happen. That is why we as  the  ANC  are  happy  that  the
Government that we have is accountable, and it has a responsibility  to  the
nation of Africa. [Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, before  calling  upon  the  next
speaker, may I request some order in  the  House,  please?  Thank  you  very
much.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, it is logical  that  the  national  Budget  can
never predict all the financial problems and needs that may arise.  That  is
probably the reason why most parliaments have the practice and tradition  of
financial adjustments at least once before the end of the financial year.

The PAC, however, in the  limited  time  at  its  disposal,  would  like  to
comment on a few matters. First, it is commendable  that  these  adjustments
include education, arts and culture, science and technology, health,  safety
and security, agriculture, labour, and trade and industry.

Money spent on education will be useless, however, if the  children  of  the
poor cannot advance their education merely because their parents  are  poor.
Educated  children  are  a  national  asset.  The  PAC  is  advocating  free
education for all children from poor homes.
Our hospitals and clinics, especially in  the  rural  areas  and  townships,
leave much to be desired in terms of  the  standard  of  medical  treatment.
Many nurses have left for Saudi Arabia, Britain  and  other  countries,  and
this is continuing. The Budget must be used to improve conditions  for  both
the patients and the medical personnel.

The PAC has long expressed its disagreement with the sale  of  state  assets
to the  rich.  This  privatisation  of  state  assets  has  created  massive
unemployment while it enriches the  rich,  especially  foreigners  who  have
stronger  currencies  than  the  present  limping  rand.  Money   spent   on
privatisation is therefore creating joblessness and poverty.

What  about  presidential  expenditure?  This  country  has   an   adequate,
efficient air service. Given  the  urgent  needs  of  this  country,  is  it
necessary to expend millions of rands  on  a  presidential  aircraft  amidst
increasing poverty, joblessness, homelessness and  disease  among  the  poor
and in the midst of so much crime?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Dr S E M PHEKO: I thank you very much, Chairperson, for banning  me  exactly
as I was before 1960. [Laughter.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, no matter how much we plan there  will  always
be a hiccup  along  the  way.  This  is  especially  so  with  economic  and
financial  events  that  affect  our  fiscal  targets.   Unforeseeable   and
unavoidable expenditure is another  factor  and  emergency  situations  also
contribute to altered plans.

The shifting of funds and many other factors have to be taken into  account.
However, the idea is that by having a plan we have a direction, and  with  a
direction we know where we are going. No matter  how  many  factors  try  to
hinder our performance, we take them as minor  setbacks  that  need  just  a
little adjustment. With poverty at the  top  of  our  list  of  problems  to
tackle, found in every sphere of society, adjustments are necessary.
The adjustments made to the main Budget are not that much and are  found  to
be adequate. It is understood that the adjustments made to most  Votes  were
as a result of roll-overs and unforeseeable or unavoidable expenditure.  The
adjustments made to the various Votes are deemed adequate.

 The MF applauds the various  departments  for  their  hard  work  that  has
produced promising results. It is felt that  the  adjustments  made  to  the
Budget would hopefully assist in  further  accommodating  good  results  and
enable departments to perform at their peak at all levels. The  MF  supports
the Adjustments Appropriation Bill.

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, for one  who  is  not  an  economist,  terms  like
``medium-term budget policy'' and ``Adjustments Appropriation Bill'' can  be
confusing. Let us in future use the term the hon  Barbara  Hogan  introduced
today - that is, the ``fine-tune budget''.

Die AEB steun die Minister se ``fine-tune budget''. Ons glo dat  die  meeste
gevalle van aanpassing geregverdig is,  en  dat  daar  nie  buitensporighede
gereflekteer word nie. Ek sou wat wou gee as ek in my persoonlike  begroting
teen die halfjaar so min aanpassings hoef te maak.

Die een uitsondering: ons weet dat die  R300  miljoen  addisioneel  vir  die
Wêreldberaad vir Volhoubare Ontwikkeling seker noodsaaklik was.  Waar  Suid-
Afrika tans 'n gewilde sentrum is  vir  die  aanbieding  van  internasionale
byeenkomste, sal ons groter erns moet maak met  die  verpligting  wat  ander
lande het ten opsigte van finansiering van hierdie tipe  byeenkomste.  Suid-
Afrika kan nie hierdie las alleen dra nie.

Ons voel besonder positief oor die feit dat slegs R3,8 miljard  aangepas  is
op die Begroting. Dit  is  maar  ongeveer  1,5%.  Ook  die  vermindering  in
onbesteebare  bedrae,  of  ``roll-overs'',  is  'n  positiewe  faktor.   Die
positiefste  aspek  van  die  aanpassingsbegroting  is  dat   die   verwagte
begrotingstekort vir 2002-03 van 2,1% van BBP tot 1,6% afgeskaal is, en  dat
dit verdere belastingtoegewings moontlik maak.
Ons steun die  R400  miljoen  vir  voedselleniging,  en  verwelkom  ook  die
ouderdoms- en ongeskiktheidspensioene wat vanaf 1 Oktober met R20 per  maand
en R10 per maand onderskeidelik verhoog. Almal moet egter saamstem  dat  dit
'n druppel in die emmer is. Die  enigste  manier  om  armoede  te  beveg  is
uiteindelik  deur  groter   ekonomiese   groei   en   gepaardgaande   groter
werkskepping.  Daarvoor  moet  beleggingsvertroue  verstewig  word,  en  die
waarde van die rand gestabiliseer word.

Die AEB steun met vrymoedigheid  die  Miniser  se  ``fine-tune''  begroting.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The AEB supports the Minister's fine-tune budget. We believe that  in  most
cases the adjustment was justified and that no  extravagance  is  reflected.
What I would not give to have to make so  few  adjustments  in  my  personal
budget by mid-year.

The one exception: we know that the additional R300 million  for  the  World
Summit on  Sustainable  Development  was  surely  necessary.  Because  South
Africa is presently a very popular centre for the hosting  of  international
gatherings,  we  will  have   to   become   more   serious   regarding   the
responsibilities of other countries with regard to the  financing  of  these
types of gatherings. South Africa cannot carry this burden alone.

We feel particularly positive about the fact  that  only  R3,8  billion  was
adjusted in this Budget. This is only approximately 1.5%.  The  decrease  in
unspent amounts,  or  roll-overs,  is  also  a  positive  factor.  The  most
positive aspect of  the  adjustments  appropriation  is  that  the  expected
budget deficit for 2002-03 of 2,1% of GDP has been scaled down to 1,6%,  and
that this makes further tax concessions possible.

We support the R400 million for food relief, and also welcome  the  old  age
and disability grants which increased from 1 October with R20 per month  and
R10 per month respectively. Everybody should, however, agree  that  this  is
merely a drop in the ocean. The only way  to  fight  poverty  is  eventually
through greater economic growth and concomitant greater  job  creation.  For
that we need to strengthen investor confidence and the  value  of  the  rand
must be stabilised.

The AEB supports the Minister's fine-tune budget with confidence.]

Mr C M LOWE: Chairperson, it is particularly appropriate that we debate  the
Adjustments Appropriation Bill  in  the  very  same  week  that  the  DA  is
launching its basic income grant campaign and is spelling  out  exactly  how
it would finance it, for where the Minister and his  team  at  the  National
Treasury succeed in promoting economic development, good governance,  social
progress and rising living standards, we shall not hesitate to  applaud  and
support these achievements.

 The adjustments proposals are a case in point, and the DA recognises  that,
given the inflationary pressures present in the  economy,  the  increase  is
relatively modest, but therein lies the  rub.  The  inflation  question  and
particularly its dramatic effect on food prices and the lives  of  the  poor
is one that needs to be directly and honestly addressed.

As today's front-page article in Business Day again so  aptly  demonstrates,
it has been largely the  spectacular  collapse  of  our  currency  that  has
brought about the spiralling food  prices,  created  double-digit  inflation
and seen consumers staggering under  four  interest  rate  hikes  this  year
alone. The reason  for  that  lies  squarely  at  the  door  of  Government,
precipitated by a President who has  failed  to  demonstrate  leadership  or
instil confidence in a country crying out for the  foreign  investment  that
will help to bring the better life so often promised, yet so seldom seen.

Hence we have a crisis of confidence over our attitude to Zimbabwe  and  the
human rights  abuses  and  starvation  that  threaten  six  million  of  her
citizens, a crisis of confidence  over  the  real  cause  of  Aids  and  the
provision of lifesaving drugs for those struck down by the virus, and now  a
crisis of confidence and confusion over Nepad and what mechanisms,  if  any,
exist for political peer review among member states.

And while our people reel under the  blows  of  double-digit  inflation  and
rocketing food prices, and look aghast at the  failure  of  our  once  proud
rainbow nation to take a stand against the terror of the Mugabe regime,  our
President, instead of inspiring leadership and confidence to strengthen  the
rand, blames it all on a  secret  cabal,  the  self-appointed  champions  of
human rights. Markets respond accordingly and South Africans everywhere  pay
the price.

One does not have to be a dreamer or  a  camel  to  realise  that  when  the
President changes his tune, the  difficult  job  and  juggling  act  of  the
Minister of Finance will become infinitely easier  and  the  poorest  people
the ANC claims to represent will have their burden lifted too. [Applause.]

Mr F C FANKOMO: Chairperson, hon members of Parliament,  let  me  follow  in
the footsteps of those hon members who have deliberated before  me.  At  the
beginning of this financial year, the  Minister  of  Finance  presented  the
Budget  for  the  2002-03  financial  year  for   spending   on   Government
objectives. The aim of  the  Budget  is  about  finding  a  balance  between
several broad  Government  objectives.  Some  of  these  objectives  are  to
provide for social and development  expenditure,  to  overcome  poverty,  to
provide safety and security, to enhance  investment  in  infrastructure,  to
maintain Government capital stocks, to reduce the overall burden of  tax  so
as to lower the cost of investment, job creation and  to  release  household
spending powers.

I will focus my speech on supplementary infrastructure allocations and self-
financing  expenditure.  Supplementary  infrastructure  allocations  in  the
adjustments estimates for 2002-03 are funds allocated for supplementing  the
actual Budget in order to be able to reach specific targets  or  priorities.
These are placed under the following departments.

An amount of R20 million has been provided for  supplementing  the  offices,
daily  maintenance,  repairs  and  upgrading  of  office  controls  in   the
Department of Home Affairs. An amount of R16 million has been  provided  for
supplementing the regional indicators management system in Statistics  South
Africa. An amount of R50 million  has  been  provided  to  ensure  that  the
Department of Arts, Culture, Science  and  Technology  supplements  projects
from various bids, while R60 million has  been  provided  for  supplementing
the  renovation  and  refurbishment  in  the  Departments  of  Justice   and
Constitutional Development.

The total supplementary amount that has been provided in the  Department  of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism for the  construction  of  a  new  weather
base on Marion Island is R70 million, while the Department of Transport,  in
order to upgrade 17 South African national border posts and rail  extensions
at Khayelitsha and  Umtata,  has  been  provided  with  an  amount  of  R188
million.

Supplementary infrastructure allocations, based  on  conditional  grants  in
the amount of R120 million, have been provided to the Department  of  Health
for hospital  rehabilitation,  and  an  amount  of  R150  million  has  been
provided for sanitation in clinics and  communities  by  the  Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry. Hence a total amount of R700  million  has  been
provided as a supplementary allocation in the adjustments estimates.

Although it is a general rule that in terms  of  the  Constitution  and  the
Public Finance Management Act all revenue is to be collected  and  deposited
in the National Revenue Fund, it is understood that the funds  derived  from
the sales of ammunition purchased from the Special  Defence  Account  should
be allocated to the Department of Defence. An  amount  of  R160,775  million
has been allocated to this department.

The Department of Education,  under  Programme  3:  General  Education,  has
received various local donations amounting to R1,4 million for the  national
teachers' award project during this current year.  First  National  Bank  of
South Africa has sponsored  the  Government  Communication  and  Information
System in the amount of R100 million for the Government  communicator  award
for excellent services. This award recognises improved delivery,  innovation
and excellence in the  Government  communication  profession.  However,  the
Department of Public  Service  and  Administration  received  an  amount  of
R9 000 for self-financing in the adjustments estimates.

I welcome and support this Adjustments Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon members, it is  clear  that,  save
for a few questions, there is broad support in the House, but  I  think  the
hon Aucamp - I am not sure which party he represents now -  put  his  finger
on  it.  Right  now  we  are  finalising  a  Budget  that  is  meant  to  be
appropriated  and  last  until  31  March  2004.   We   are   dealing   with
uncertainties  in  that  kind  of  environment  and,  notwithstanding  those
challenges, I think that, in relative terms, if one looks at world  practice
we do exceptionally well in this regard.

Let me just put on the other hat: I chair the Treasury Committee,  which  is
not a Cabinet subcommittee, but deals with the  requests  in  terms  of  the
unforeseeable and unavoidable criteria and sometimes it is  very  difficult.
So let me just walk through  some  of  the  issues  that  hon  members  have
raised.

The first of those is in respect of transport, and  here  on  the  one  hand
there are the bus contracts. The contracts are difficult because  they  tend
to  be  lifetime  contracts  and  they  have   variables   built   in   that
automatically kick in, including fuel prices and the price of  spares.  That
is a difficulty for the  Department  of  Transport,  but  they  are  working
through this as part of a policy change and I am sure that early in the  new
year  Parliament  will  be  proffered  a  White  Paper  dealing  with   road
transportation going forward.

In respect of commuter rail:  firstly,  the  Rail  Commuter  Corporation  is
running at a deficit and, secondly, as a result of the decline in its  asset
base there are difficulties that we face that tend to be in here. And  then,
thirdly, there is a difficulty because of  this  tangled  web  of  the  Rail
Commuter Corporation, Metrorail and all of those  entities  coming  together
in a rather strange way. That needs to be untangled going forward.

In respect of public works, there are three elements, one of  which  is  the
rates bill. This has been a period  of  uncertainty  and  we  have  to  take
account of that. Secondly, there are  backlogs  in  respect  of  health  and
safety in many Government buildings  and  that  has  had  to  be  addressed.
Thirdly, as reflected for instance in the adjustments to the Treasury  Vote,
sometimes we deal with pretty tough owners of the buildings that  we  occupy
and this creates a lot of uncertainty for the Department of Public Works  in
their negotiations.

With regard to the  issues  of  Home  Affairs  -  and  I  am  sure  Minister
Buthelezi will deal with this in  question  time  -  apropos  Hanis,  it  is
important to recognise the scale of this  project.  For  a  long  while  the
expenditure was slow, the tolerances were higher, and so  the  planning  was
done for a very  different  exchange  rate  environment.  But  now,  as  the
project is taking off - and we should all be thankful that the  digitisation
of the Home Affairs database is now starting  to  happen  -  the  costs  are
kicking in and the tolerances are substantially lower.

In respect of the way in which the Treasury Committee  looked  at  this,  we
familiarised ourselves with all of the  detail.  Whilst,  yes,  in  absolute
terms it may be difficult to argue  unforeseeability  in  all  instances,  I
think  that  we  would  plead  that  the  House  supports  this,  given  the
circumstances and the environment that we operate in.

I would just like to say that  the  hon  Lowe  should  not  talk  about  the
collapse of the  currency,  because  he  does  not  know  what  a  collapsed
currency is. It must  really  grate  on  members  like  that  when  we  have
upgrades by rating agencies for good performance, because  they  will  never
quite appreciate it. But thank you very much to the House for  the  support.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a first time.

                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                    (Consideration of Votes and Schedule)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, consideration of the  Votes  and
Schedule  should  be  limited  to  adjustments   and   reasons   for   those
adjustments. I will put each Vote in turn, whereupon members will  have  the
opportunity  to  raise  issues  about  the  adjustments  with  the  relevant
Ministers.

Vote No 3 - Foreign Affairs:

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, the ACDP would like to ask  the  Minister  if  the
need for government to protect  opposition  officials,  political  tolerance
and the promotion of democracy  were  raised  during  the  recent  bilateral
discussions with the Zimbabwe government. If not, why not? If so,  what  was
their response?

The MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  Chairperson,  I  know  that  Minister  Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma will join us in a few minutes, so with your permission - and  I
have not consulted the Whips - could the question stand over  until  she  is
with us? It will just be a few minutes, and I  trust  that  the  hon  Dudley
will accept that.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: We will hold  this  Vote  over  and  continue
with the next Vote.

Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government:

Mnr C AUCAMP: Voorsitter, ek sien die Minister is ook nie hier nie, maar  ek
kan dalk die Minister van Finansies vra. Dit gaan oor die begroting vir  die
artikel 185 kommissie vir die bevordering van die regte van taal-,  kultuur-
en godsdienstige gemeenskappe. Dié kommissie sou hierdie jaar al begin  het.
Ons sien dit is nog nie daar nie. Is daar enige planne? Volgens  beplanning,
wanneer gaan  dié  kommissie  begin?  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, I see  the  Minister  is  not  here  either,  but
perhaps I can ask the Minister of Finance. This relates to  the  budget  for
the section 185 Commission for the Promotion and Protection  of  the  Rights
of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities.  This  commission  should
have begun its work this  year.  We  notice  that  it  has  still  not  been
established. Are there any plans? According  to  planning,  when  will  this
commission commence?]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister of  Finance,  are  you  able  to
answer that?

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: [Inaudible.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: We will have to ask for  that  one  to  stand
over.

Vote No 8 - National Treasury:

Mr R J HEINE: Chairperson, I would like  to  ask  the  Minister  of  Finance
whether he is aware of the fact that on Sunday Mr Nick Wolpe, the  organiser
of the network lounge at the ANC's  national  conference  in  December,  was
quoted as saying that several parastatals  and  Government  departments  had
expressed a keenness to take part  in  the  network  lounge  at  a  cost  of
R70 000 per exhibition. I would like to know  which  Government  departments
and parastatals these are that are prepared to take  part  and  whether  the
Minister agrees with the principle, because this is  taxpayers'  money  that
we are talking about.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I do not know  what  the  Rules  allow
for. I suppose the next question might be:  What  is  the  weather  like  in
Tokyo today? Sadly, that question has absolutely  nothing  to  do  with  the
National Treasury Vote and I ask that it not be accommodated.

Dr G W KOORNHOF:  Mr  Chairperson,  an  amount  of  R15,6  million  will  be
utilised to cover the costs of the Myburgh Commission of  Inquiry  into  the
Rapid Depreciation of the Exchange Rate of the Rand. My  question  is:  What
is the final cost of the Myburgh commission?

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, to the best of my knowledge the  final
cost is R15,6 million. The Myburgh commission has wrapped up  its  work  and
published its report.

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, I thank the Minister for his reply  to  the  hon
Koornhof, but could he indicate whether he believes that  the  work  of  the
Myburgh  commission  has  resulted  in  policy  recommendations  which   the
Treasury will pursue any further and whether he  considers  the  expenditure
on the Myburgh commission to have been wasteful or to have given  value  for
money?

The MINISTER OF  FINANCE:  Chairperson,  the  terms  of  reference  for  the
commission specifically excluded policy recommendations. They were  required
to investigate and they have investigated. In the context of  the  terms  of
reference we in the Treasury find the  work  exceedingly  helpful.  We  also
believe that the work of the Myburgh commission assisted  in  educating  all
South Africans about the complexity  of  foreign  exchange  markets,  and  I
think we have  all  learnt  something  as  a  result  of  the  work  of  the
commission. As we indicated on 29 October, some  of  the  issues  that  were
raised by the Myburgh commission will be taken up when we table  the  Budget
on 26 February 2003.

Vote No 9 - Public Enterprises:

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mr Chairperson, may I enquire  from  the  Minister  whether
any additional moneys have been made available  for  the  purpose  of  black
economic empowerment? If so, can he say at what aspects of it the  money  is
aimed?

Secondly, does the Minister not feel that  it  is  high  time  now  that  we
changed this concept of black economic empowerment  to  the  empowerment  of
the previously disadvantaged? I ask this because it is  my  experience  that
coloured and Indian people feel that it is not directed at  them,  but  only
at a fortunate few within the black community.

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: It is aimed  at  all  people  who  were
historically  disadvantaged  by  the  system  of  apartheid.  That  includes
coloureds and Indians and Africans, and some white women who were  oppressed
by the apartheid system. That is our broad conception of that.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: We will now go back to Vote No  3  -  Foreign
Affairs. I ask the hon member from the ACDP to put her question again.

Vote No 3 - Foreign Affairs:

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, in relation to Nepad, was the need for  government
to protect opposition officials, political tolerance and  the  promotion  of
democracy raised during the recent bilateral discussions with  the  Zimbabwe
government? If not, why not? If so, what was their response?

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  maybe  the  hon  member  can
enlighten me as to why opposition members need to be protected - from  whom,
from what and for what. Then I might be able to answer her.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, I want us to  pay  attention  to
the adjustments and be focused with our questions  on  the  business  before
the House. Are there any further questions to Foreign Affairs?

Dr P W A MULDER: Chairperson, there is an  adjustment  of  R19  billion  for
inflation in the estimates - on salaries, if I understand it  correctly.  My
question relates to the serious problems  experienced  by  personnel  abroad
when new regulations were implemented regarding their benefits, and  so  on.
Is that part of this adjustment? Has that problem been solved or not?  As  I
said, some of them complained to me that they suddenly experienced  problems
when the Minister of  Finance  implemented  certain  forms  of  taxation  on
benefits.

The  MINISTER  OF  FOREIGN  AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  the  problem  has   been
partially solved, although it has not been  solved  for  all  time.  We  are
looking for a permanent solution, as I said when I was introducing my  Vote.
For now there has  been  a  partial  solution,  so  the  diplomats  are  not
suffering because of that 40% taxation rate. But  we  are  still  discussing
the matter with Treasury in order to find a permanent solution  so  that  we
do not face this crisis every year.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Let us now return to Vote No 5  -  Provincial
and Local Government.

Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government:

 Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, before I start, may I ask for  the  speech  timer
to be zeroed? My putting of this question earlier does not count.
Presumably the section 185 commission on cultural and linguistic rights  and
so on was budgeted for in this financial year, but  the  commission  is  not
there yet. When will we see the commission and what impact does it  have  on
the Budget?

The  MINISTER  FOR  PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:   Chairperson,   the
commission was budgeted for in the  normal  way,  as  the  member  correctly
says. The President has already issued  an  invitation  to  members  of  the
public to make nominations, after which he will consider  appointing  people
to serve on the commission. So the matter is in the public domain.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, van die  Aansuiweringsbegroting  van
R194 miljoen, gaan R108 miljoen  vir  salarisse.  Nou  wil  ek  by  die  agb
Minister weet:  is  dit  deel  van  die  hoër  salarisse  van,  byvoorbeeld,
munisipale bestuurders wat tussen R500 000 en R700 000 per jaar verdien?  In
die lig van wat die  agb  Minister  van  Finansies  gesê  het  oor  die  hoë
salarisse op die vlak van plaaslike regering,  wat  gaan  die  agb  Minister
daaromtrent doen? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, of the R194 million in  the  Adjustments
Appropriation some R108 million is going towards salaries.  Now  I  want  to
know from the hon the  Minister  whether  this  forms  part  of  the  higher
salaries of, for instance, municipal managers who are earning  between  R500
000 and R700 000 per year? In the light of what  the  hon  the  Minister  of
Finance has had to say about the high salaries at  local  government  level,
what is the hon the Minister going to do about this?]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson,  the  amount
that the hon member referred  to  is  an  inflation  adjustment.  It  is  an
adjustment  that  occurs  especially  when  higher  than   expected   salary
increases have come into effect. This has  absolutely  nothing  to  do  with
local government. Local government is not part of the equation with  respect
to budgeting for personnel expenditure.

Mr C H F GREYLING: Chairperson, I just want to  ask  the  hon  the  Minister
about Programme 2. I am concerned that R29,8 million of CMIP funds has  been
rolled over because various projects were not  completed  by  municipalities
in the previous year. Given the fact that we have an estimated  R70  billion
backlog for infrastructure for municipalities, and that it is  a  Government
priority to alleviate the plight of the poor and to  boost  the  economy,  I
want to ask the Minister whether  his  department  has  plans  in  place  to
ensure that in the current year, when  the  Minister  has  allocated  nearly
double the amount of CMIP funds, he is  ready  for  all  that  money  to  be
spent.

I am also concerned in this regard about that fact that, in  this  financial
year, district municipalities received and oversaw that money, and  not  the
provinces, which creates further problems.  I  therefore  want  to  ask  the
Minister, bearing in mind that his  policy  is  that  municipalities  cannot
roll over these funds, whether he is ready to oversee expenditure this  year
and ensure that all the money is spent on infrastructure.
The MINISTER FOR  PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson,  we  are
satisfied that the spending patterns with  respect  to  both  CMIP  and  the
local economic development funds have not  been  that  bad.  The  roll-overs
have to do with projects that are  under  implementation.  Commitments  have
already been made, but indeed the money has not  been  spent,  although  the
projects are under way. So the money which was not used is  still  going  to
be used, and therefore there is nothing to worry about.

Vote No 13 - Statistics South Africa:

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Chairperson, Census 2001 will now be finalised  before  the
expected date of October 2003. My question is: What  will  the  Minister  do
and how much will it cost to terminate the lease agreements for  office  and
other rental accommodation that were negotiated to  continue  until  October
2003?

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, the processing  centre,  which  is  in
Pretoria North-West, more or less, has now been fitted out. There have  been
negotiations with the owner of the building. We will continue  to  use  that
as a processing centre. It may be used by other  Government  departments  as
well, because the big investments by Statistics South Africa  have  actually
been in information technology. The big change has been facilitated  by  the
use of enormous scanners  which  are  capable  of  scanning  a  few  hundred
thousand images per day each. It would be possible for other departments  to
use this. The mechanics of that will have to be worked  out  going  forward,
but the processing centre as such is likely to remain operational.

 The other processing centre, which was in Port  Elizabeth,  was  shut  down
earlier this year, and so we are down to the one in Pretoria North-West.

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, the Minister will recall that earlier this  year
the President succeeded in getting entangled in a dispute about  the  causes
of death in South Africa. We note the following  statement  in  relation  to
the allocation for the roll-overs for the Statistics South Africa Vote:


  The Presidency required mortality statistics that were not available  and
  called on Statistics South Africa to obtain the necessary information.

Can the Minister give us an indication as to which guidelines  decide  which
statistics will be gathered and which statistics will not be  gathered,  and
why this allocation and this particular request have  been  accommodated  in
this way? It is purely aimed at ensuring that the theory  of  the  President
is proved and the statistics agency is roped in accordingly.

The   MINISTER   OF   FINANCE:   Assumptions,   assumptions,    assumptions!
Chairperson, in the course of our work in Statistics South Africa there  are
requests from different departments. One of the  more  recent  requests  was
from the Department of Agriculture for a detailed study on the  agricultural
sector. That is work in progress, and we are very much still in the  process
of collecting the questionnaires from farmers.

Also there was a huge study undertaken two years ago on rape, and  that  was
initially requested by the Departments of Health and of Safety and  Security
together. In that context, and as part of the development of what we call  a
national statistical system, other departments would be  part  of  gathering
information, but it would remain  the  responsibility  of  Statistics  South
Africa, as per the Statistics Act.

In the context of the mortality  statistics,  they  involved,  firstly,  the
Department of Home Affairs, because they  required  a  retro-scan  of  death
certificates, and, secondly, the Department of Health to look at the  causes
of death, both primary and secondary, as listed on death certificates.  That
work is now in the final stages and Statistics  South  Africa  advises  that
they will be in a position to release these statistics within the  next  few
weeks.

Vote No 14 - Arts, Culture, Science and Technology:

Mr S L DITHEBE: Chairperson, there are eight science centres in Africa,  and
six of these are in South Africa. One is in Botswana and  another  in  Mali.
My question is: Does the Deputy Minister's department have plans  to  ensure
that entrance fees at these science centres are not  beyond  the  levels  of
affordability for ordinary people, seeing that a further  R6,7  million  has
been allocated for the construction of science centres? We would  also  like
to congratulate the department.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Chairperson,
the whole point of having a directorate for public understanding of  science
is, in fact, the principle of providing society  with  an  understanding  of
science. We have a special vehicle that we created, which is the  Foundation
for Education, Science and Technology -  generally  known  by  its  acronym,
Fest - through which we develop programmes for  bringing  science  education
to society at large.

Indeed, one of the directives from the directorate of  Puset  is  that  they
should ensure access to a knowledge of science, and  that  would  presuppose
that entrance fees should not hinder access. To answer very directly,  Puset
has programmes for bringing science to people in rural, urban and  periurban
areas. In fact,  Fest  annually  runs  programmes  to  bring  young  people,
through school programmes, to science centres.

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Chairperson, we note that the funds for  Vote  No  14  have
been transferred, since 1 August, to Vote No 34, for the Department of  Arts
and Culture, and Vote No 35, for the Department of Science  and  Technology.
This is to enable the two departments, now that the original department  has
been divided into two, to carry out their restructuring programme. I  wanted
to find out from the hon the  Deputy  Minister  what  formula  was  used  to
determine how much each of these departments should receive.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Chairperson,
even when there  was  a  single  department,  the  budget  was  specifically
directed to programmes, except for corporate  services.  The  divisions  are
according to the separate programmes  and  thus  designated  separately  for
arts and culture and for science and technology.

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Chairperson, under Programme 4: National  Language  Services
we understand that money has been rolled over that  will  be  used  for  the
employment of staff and also for purchasing furniture. One  had  hoped  that
something would  be  said  about  the  language  policy.  Would  the  Deputy
Minister appease us by telling us when we are going to see  something  being
said on the language policy?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Chairperson,
of course the large part of the budget  for  language  is  for  implementing
policy because we are at that stage. What my colleague should note  is  that
the infrastructure for language is being set up. Just let me say that I  can
assure her that we are doing it the right way.
Vote No 15 - Education:

Mr R  S  NTULI:  Chairperson,  the  DP  supports  the  adjustments  estimate
regarding education. We understand that the roll-overs concern  areas  where
our educational  system  is  most  vulnerable,  namely  poverty  relief  and
infrastructural projects. We hope that the roll-overs will also be  used  to
strengthen auxiliary  and  associated  services  by  engaging  more  subject
specialists  to  offer  the  much-needed  back-up  support  to  teachers  in
curricular  development  and  interpretation,  as  well   as   psychological
services to teachers and learners under stress and pain.

Adequate training will also be needed for the new curriculum  for  Grade  10
to 12 teachers to be able to operate in  the  new  paradigm  of  OBE,  while
teaching the traditional syllabi must also receive priority as there  is  no
proper articulation between the GET band and  senior  secondary  schoolwork.
Simultaneously, sound preparation for the implementation of FET in the  year
2004 must  take  place.  The  introduction  of  compulsory  mathematics  and
mathematical literacy  in  the  FET  band  requires  massive  retraining  of
teachers.

Can the Minister indicate whether he  has  done  some  further  research  in
terms of reliable data and  cost  implications  to  implement  these  highly
demanded items?

The MINISTER  OF  EDUCATION:  Chairperson,  I  actually  had  difficulty  in
hearing the question. I really have a serious problem.  [Interjections.]  It
is not because of my age - I just had a test done - but I am  really  having
difficulty.

Out of consideration for the hon Ntuli, the answer is  yes.  He  should  not
believe everything he reads in the weekend newspapers. I have said  publicly
and I announced to  the  House  that  the  further  education  and  training
certificate, which  will  replace  the  senior  certificate,  will  only  be
implemented after a long period of consultation which  ends  in  January.  I
know the weather in Dublin, by the way. I do not know whether it is  raining
now, but I will still answer his question.
In addition, I have said that in co-operation with the Council of  Education
Ministers, no steps will be taken for  the  implementation  of  the  further
education  and  training  certificate  until  we  are  sure  that  adequate,
satisfactory and intensive training takes place. That has been announced.

Secondly, it is a high-cost area, because we are  making  a  leap  from  the
apartheid senior certificate, which everybody accepts,  by  the  way.  There
must be teachers' materials and learning materials for the  students.  Until
we are satisfied that adequate funding will be  available  for  that,  there
will be no movement to implementation.

The nominal date which the department proposed is 2004. My  own  view  is  -
and I will be writing to the department as a citizen -  that  this  date  of
2004 is unrealistic. It has to be put forward. Therefore, in  the  meantime,
we will have to negotiate with the unions also, because there  is  no  doubt
that there are obsolete subjects. We have more than 130 subjects  in  matric
this year. It is impossible for any country to deal with that. The  obsolete
subjects will go by the board, and we will have to  provide  for  retraining
for the teachers. That is a complex matter, too.

 I would also like to say that the subject  is  not  closed.  There  are  35
subjects that we have identified. There will be public  intervention  as  to
additional subjects. Out of the foreign languages, we have  identified  four
or five which will be part of the foreign language programme. There will  be
additional foreign languages, depending on the  need  and  the  capacity  of
some of these embassies to pay for those foreign  languages.  So  everything
is open.

I hope, therefore, the member will take  into  account  that  the  statement
which he made, which I read in the Sowetan, is based on  a  fallacious  idea
that came with a weekly journal.

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, the hon the Minister, in his latest  statement  on
tertiary institutions, said that no university would have the  right  to  be
exclusively Afrikaans. That means compulsory dual or parallel  medium.  Does
the Minister intend to ask for more funding, because  this  will  definitely
cost more?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I am pleased to answer this.  I  am  looking  for
the heading in the eight or nine programmes that are before the House.

Let us be quite clear. There is  no  compulsory  parallel  or  dual  medium.
There cannot be. The primary thing is the context of  multilingualism.  That
is why there is an extraordinary reaction from my own side,  the  opposition
parties and from academics that multilingualism is the route  to  follow.  I
am pleased that the hon leader of the Freedom Front  has  insisted  in  this
House  that  we  should  seriously   move   towards   multilingualism.   The
fundamental approach of the Government - there  was  great  enthusiasm  from
the Government - is that we must now take active  measures  to  ensure  that
the  indigenous  African  languages  which,  up  to   now,   have   had   no
consideration in higher education, will now be assisted.

Yesterday, I announced in a press conference -  the  member  may  have  seen
this - that I am setting up a working group of people directly  involved  to
move with some expedition towards, first  of  all,  reviving  the  study  of
languages in higher education. I must confess  that  all  11  languages  are
discounted for purposes of study as a language. I regret  that,  because  we
need our writers, our poets and our teachers, but culturally we need  people
to study languages in higher education. Therefore, the  position  about  all
languages is the further development of languages.

What we have said - and I think the hon Aucamp should really look at this  -
is that there cannot be  any  exclusive  emphasis  on  one  language  in  an
institution. No institution in South Africa teaches exclusively through  one
language, even English. What  we  are  saying  is  that  there  are  certain
institutions whose primary emphasis might be on a particular  language,  let
us  say  Afrikaans.  The  primary  emphasis  means  that  the   institutions
themselves must work out a plan as to how to support and develop a  national
heritage, such as Afrikaans is, and learning and teaching in it.

I cannot prescribe by  law:  Thou  shalt  be  dual  medium;  thou  shalt  be
parallel medium. I am only allowed, under the Higher Education Act,  to  set
the framework. It is up  to  the  institutions  to  take  into  account  the
constitutional, ethical and moral aspects associated with languages so  that
we can  give,  as  our  Constitution  says,  ``parity  of  esteem''  to  all
languages.

This Government will not be  a  party  to  either  demonising  a  particular
language or reducing its role in South Africa. We did not fight for  freedom
so that we could remove fundamental aspects of identity for all our  people.
On the other hand, we have to look at equity, because  all  institutions  in
South Africa, in the end, are South African institutions.

I would like to offer an opportunity for all political parties, between  now
and  January,  to  discuss  the  actual  application  of  the   Government's
proposals. I have already received one invitation. They should  discuss  the
actual applications rather than taking positions which are out of step  with
the Government's proposals.

I hope I have clarified the matter.

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Mr Chairman, we welcome the  provision  for  early  childhood
development. We are very pleased to  see  that  this,  in  future,  will  be
provided for in the mainstream Budget. We want to  ask:  Is  there  anything
more that can be done to ensure that the funds provided  are  actually  used
at provincial level, especially when it comes to the rural areas.  Is  there
anything further that can be done?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION:  I  must  confess,  I  did  not  hear  the  first
sentence. Again, it is the noise. I am sorry.

Mr T ABRAHAMS: I referred to the provision for early childhood  development.
We welcome the fact that, in future, these provisions will be  part  of  the
mainstream Budget. We are asking about the rolling out of it  at  provincial
level.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: The development of early childhood  education  is
a fulfilment of the undertaking  in  the  Constitution  that  there  should,
effectively, be 10 years  of  compulsory  education.  I  think  it  is  very
important that we should fulfil that, and it will put us among  the  leading
countries in the world.

That is why we have started very, very carefully. The provinces  cannot  get
unfunded mandates. I must confess the Treasury has  been  very  co-operative
about this, because it  is  also  an  antipoverty  drive.  When  we  involve
ourselves in this,  we  will  use  some  of  the  NGOs  and  community-based
institutions, particularly in the  rural  areas.  Let  us  make  that  quite
clear. In the urban areas, we will use existing resources  in  the  schools.
Why it has to be done on a carefully planned basis is that the  schools  may
not have enough space for these people. Secondly, the teachers also have  to
be trained. We cannot inflict untrained teachers on our  people  as  happens
in many cases. Our idea  is  therefore  that,  by  2005,  all  children  who
qualify will be in early childhood education programmes. Those  who  qualify
- those who are five and are turning six - will  be  in  schools  for  early
childhood education.

That must be in the rural areas as well  as  everywhere  else.  The  problem
arises, as in the Free State, where more than 60% of the  schools  are  farm
schools. That is a real problem. That is an inheritance for which  there  is
no easy answer. It will be  like  many  other  countries.  We  may  have  to
amalgamate some  farm  schools,  but  then  one  has  to  provide  transport
facilities. These are the kinds of issues which we have to  debate,  discuss
and decide on.

Finally, I think it is important to recognise that we are the first  country
to acknowledge  that  the  human  resource  development  programme  of  this
Government, which  is  now  in  our  policy,  begins  with  early  childhood
education, and ends with higher education. We know  that  unless  one  deals
with education at  its  foundation  phase,  one  cannot  deal  with  poverty
adequately. Education and an antipoverty drive are  crucially  important  in
this area.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, can we have order in the  House,
please?

Prof S M MAYATULA: Chairperson, I wonder if the Minister  could  comment  on
the delay in the filling of 200 posts for the Ikhwelo project, which led  to
a saving of R26,8 million, and the delay in the  filling  of  posts  in  the
ECD, which led to savings  of  R106 000.  How  far  have  we  progressed  in
filling those posts now?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I must explain  to  the  House  that  both  Thuba
Makote and the Ikhwelo projects are very different from all  other  projects
in Education. All other projects are conditional grants from the  provinces.
This is a unique arrangement by Treasury, on our submission,  to  deal  with
poverty, infrastructure development, and part of the  Jobs  Summit.  I  take
personal responsibility for the delay in the full implementation.

Let us be quite clear. I think we may  have  a  serious  indictment  on  the
capacity of Government departments to have project  managers.  That  is  the
reason for this. The Treasury  have  been  very  understanding  about  this,
because they have reviewed the commitments for 2003,  but  it  is  not  good
enough. It is an antipoverty drive. In Thuba Makote, we  spent  R1  million,
out of R48 million. Then there is a roll-over.

The answer I am getting from  the  department  is  that  we  need  community
involvement. It is very important, because, first of all,  Thuba  Makote  is
for three community institutions in each  province.  They  will  be  dealing
with agriculture, domestic science and crafts, which are very important  for
job creation and training. Community involvement, identification  of  sites,
obtaining sites, developing building plans that are suitable, tendering  and
construction are the things that have  to  occur.  All  I  announce  now  at
present, therefore, is that construction has begun  with  the  first  centre
per province. As I said, it is not good enough. It  is  seriously  not  good
enough.

For the Ikhwelo projects, which are for adult basic education and  training,
for the provision of these centres, again, R25 million was voted in  2001-02
on the South African National Literacy  project.  Of  this  R6  million  was
spent. This again is a problem. Of course, the Treasury has recognised  that
this is a work in progress. I do  not  believe  in  the  Latin  tag  festina
lenta, hasten slowly. We need to act with considerable expedition.

I can assure Prof Mayatula that nothing is lost in  this,  because  we  will
finish the projects, but the way we do the projects, the  way  in  which  we
implement them and the way we apply to the Treasury for assistance need  the
strictest supervision if we are to meet the objectives that we  set  out  to
achieve.

Vote No 16 - Health:

Mrs S V KALYAN: Chairperson, a sum of R5  million  has  been  allocated  ...
[Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Yet again, when  the  hon
Kalyan stands up to say something in this Parliament, there  are  people  on
that  side  of  the  House   who   cannot   help   making   animal   noises.
[Interjections.] I want to warn them this  afternoon  that  if  there  is  a
repeat of that, the DP will vote against every single Vote to teach  them  a
lesson. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! We have appealed  to  hon  members  on
numerous occasions to refrain from  making  catcalls  when  the  hon  Kalyan
speaks.  [Interjections.]  Please  can   we   have   order,   hon   members!
[Interjections.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Chairperson, a sum of R5 million has been allocated  to  the
Department of Health to cover legal costs in  the  court  case  between  the
Minister and the Treatment Action Campaign. It is  scandalous,  to  say  the
least, that the  Minister  uses  taxpayers'  money  to  fight  her  personal
agendas and to publicly display her inefficiency.

Despite being  ordered  by  the  court  to  roll  out  universal  access  to
nevirapine, the Minister has yet to comply. Will  she  explain  the  reasons
for her failure to do so, and  also  say  how  she  plans  to  ensure  good,
principled management of  this  vital  portfolio  instead  of  depending  on
lengthy, costly and unnecessary litigation  to  decide  the  health  of  the
nation? [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Mr Chairperson, I do not know who is applauding  the
hon MP, because I think that the hon MP does not have the correct  facts.  I
am not here to assist the hon the Minister to understand the ruling  of  the
Constitutional Court. [Interjections.] I am sorry, I meant to  say``the  hon
MP''. [Interjections.] I invite the hon member of Parliament to go and  read
the Constitutional Court ruling. [Interjections.] If she heckles  me,  am  I
going to be able to respond to her? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  member,  if  you  want  a
reply, I think you should allow the hon the Minister to make the reply.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: If she wants a reply, she must listen.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  The  Chair  will  protect  you,  hon
Minister.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Please protect me. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: I am sure she cannot  listen  with  her  mouth.  She
should use her ears to listen, not her mouth. [Interjections.]

I was saying that she should go and read  the  Constitutional  Court  ruling
... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  A  point  of  order  has  been
taken. The Chair would like to insist that there be decorum in  this  House.
Any  member  who  is  found  to  be  making  catcalls  will   face   serious
repercussions. [Laughter.] I would like to warn hon  members  against  that.
Please take note, and I think I would like you again to recognise that  this
is the Parliament of South Africa, and I would  like  you  to  preserve  the
decorum of the House.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, as I was  saying,  the  hon  member  of
Parliament must use her ears, and not her mouth, to listen to me.

Mrs S V KALYAN: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: There she goes again!  [Laughter.]  [Interjections.]
She herself is making catcalls! [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

 Mrs S V KALYAN: Chairperson, on a point  of  order:  I  was  not  making  a
catcall. I was asking the Minister to use her grey  matter  and  answer  the
question.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I have asked you also,  if
you want a reply, to afford the Minister the opportunity to make the  reply,
but you have yourself not been heeding the advice of the Chair to allow  the
Minister to do so. [Interjections.]

The  MINISTER  OF  HEALTH:   If   the   hon   member   of   Parliament   ...
[Interjections.]

Dr B G MBULAWA-HANS: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is  it  parliamentary
for a member to say to a Minister that she must use her  grey  matter?  That
implies that the Minister is stupid. I think you need to rule on that.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, in  Parliament,  we
allow for the cut and thrust of debate.  We  allow  for  robust  debate  and
robust  discussion.  [Interjections.]  While  you  are  permitted  to   make
interjections, I think you also have to heed the  advice  of  the  Chair  to
allow for a situation where a question-and-answer session  will  afford  the
Minister the opportunity to make a studious response. But  if  you  continue
to interject, it is well within the right of the Chair to ask for  order.  I
therefore suggest that you allow the Minister to make her response, and  you
will have  an  opportunity,  if  you  wish,  after  that,  to  make  further
interventions.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson,  I  do  not  think  there  is  anything
scandalous  and  inefficient  in  implementing  the  Constitutional  Court's
decisions in this country. Besides, we had already started implementing  the
mother-to-child transmission programmes. If the MP does not  understand  the
cycle of this appropriately, then I do not know what to say, because it  was
in April, and the decision only came out in  ...  I  mean,  we  are  talking
about the cycle from April to 31 March next year. I do not know what she  is
talking about. It is  studious,  and  I  think  it  is  correct  for  us  to
implement the Constitutional Court's decision, which we had already  started
to implement, in any case, even before the court  case,  without  any  money
having been given to us, because we are  actually  very  interested  in  the
health of the women of this country.

We were also trying to implement this programme so  as  to  understand  what
the operational costs were. Of  course,  we  were  caught  unawares  by  the
decision of the Constitutional Court, and we had to continue.  So,  if  that
is scandalous and inefficient, then the MP must come and tell me what it  is
that I was expected to do. [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, the ACDP have  a  number  of  questions.  Firstly,
under the Strategic Health Programme, for how  long  will  taxpayers'  money
fund the slaughter of unborn babies, which is not only  tolerated  in  South
Africa, but promoted? Secondly,  by  when  will  the  disgraceful  state  of
hospitals and clinics be adequately addressed? Why are  doctors  and  nurses
leaving this country  in  droves?  When  will  the  intimidation  of  health
workers over the issue of abortion be stopped? Why are we  wasting  millions
of rands on condoms and organisations such  as  LoveLife,  which  have  done
nothing to stem the HIV/Aids  pandemic,  but  have  rather  exacerbated  it?
[Interjections.] The Treatment Action Campaign say that Government does  not
have an acceptable plan to curb the pandemic. Up  to  now,  they  have  been
right. What does the hon the Minister say? Lastly, the MCC reports that  20%
of all ethical medicines in circulation in South Africa are fakes,  smuggled
...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  member,  we  are  dealing
with the adjustments.

Ms C DUDLEY: Correct.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: We  are  not  dealing  with  the  main
Budget and therefore you will have to restrict yourself to the  aspect  that
deals with the adjustment. I cannot permit you to deal with the broad  ambit
of the subject. So I am requesting you seriously to confine yourself to  the
element of adjustment.

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, they do apply to the adjustments. On the issue  of
fake medicines, we just wanted to know what South Africa is doing  about  it
and what other countries are doing about it.

 The MINISTER OF HEALTH:  Chairperson,  you  have  saved  me  an  unpleasant
question. I think if the hon member wants  answers  on  the  policy  of  the
department, that is a different matter. She knows that I have  an  open-door
policy. She can come to my office and ask those questions.

Vote No 17 - Housing:

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, as all of us are aware that  housing  is  a
great problem in our country, I will come straight to the question  and  ask
the Minister whether there will  be  any  further  adjustment  made  in  the
allocation of finance to continue building houses for the homeless.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, the answer to  the  question  is  yes,
but I think that  there  is  a  series  of  pressures  developing  as  well,
because, having received the houses, very poor  people  have  difficulty  in
maintaining them. So there needs to be institutional support.

I am advised that the Minister of Housing is involved  both  with  MECs  for
housing and with local government. Because  even  beyond  the  provision  of
free basic services there are all  manner  of  other  kinds  of  support  to
develop communities that need to be  put  in  place.  Beyond  just  building
housing,  we  need  to  form  communities  as  well,  and  so   very   close
collaboration is taking place especially between  the  Minister  of  Housing
and the Minister for Provincial and Local Government.

Vote No 19 - Sport and Recreation South Africa:

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, the Minister  of  Sport  and  Recreation  is  in  a
relevance crisis. He thinks that to be relevant, he  should  be  loudmouthed
and overbearing, and make crude remarks  when  speaking  to  sports  bodies.
[Interjections.] He is tinkering with the colour of the paint  on  the  roof
... [Interjections.]

Mr H P CHAUKE: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: I think  the  member  is
out of order. He is not addressing the budget  estimate.  He  is  addressing
something different. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, come round to  your  point
quickly.

Mr T D LEE: He is tinkering with the colour of the paint on the roof of  the
house while he is doing very little to make sure that the foundation of  the
house ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Please, hon member come to  the
question of the estimate. Yes, I recognise you, hon Andrew.

Mr K M ANDREW: Mr Chairperson, there are two points of order: Firstly,  this
is a debate on the adjustments appropriation schedules. This is  not  simply
a question-and-answer session, and therefore as long as  an  hon  member  is
addressing a matter relevant to the adjustments appropriation he  does  not,
in fact, have to ask a question at all.
Secondly, I would like, with respect, to ask you to give the  people  asking
the questions the same protection as you are giving Ministers answering  the
questions.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I think every  member  of  this
House is entitled to be  protected  by  the  Chair.  That  has  to  be  done
impartially and honestly.

By the same token we also need to recognise that while we do have a  debate,
the  debate  and  the  subject  of  the  debate  have  to  be  relevant  and
significant. The Minister  of  Sport  and  Recreation  is  not  himself  the
subject of the debate, but rather the aspect of the estimates  is.  Provided
that the individual member deals with the matter to hand he  will  be  fully
protected by the Chair. [Applause.]

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, an example is that the  Minister  was  able  easily
and quickly to find R700 000 for his race-based and race-driven and,  may  I
say, unnecessary investigation into cricket,  while  very  little  money  is
available for sports development. The youth  of  this  country  need  sports
facilities and equipment. They need  bats  and  balls  as  well  as  playing
fields. If the Minister really wants to make himself relevant, he  must  see
to their sporting needs.

UMPHATHISWA WEZEMIDLALO NOLONWABO: Mhlalingaphambili,  xa  ndilunywa  yinja,
andiguqi  phantsi,  ndiyilume  inja.  Ukuba  ndiyayenza   loo   nto   abantu
abadlulayo abasayi kwazi ukuba yiyiphi  na  inja  phakathi  kwam  nenja  le.
[Uwele-wele.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, when a dog bites  me,  I
do not go down on my knees and bite it back. If I do that people passing  by
will not know which one of us is actually the dog. [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  Minister,  I  think  the
House is entitled to a fair response, and as much as you  may  take  offence
at the personal element, may I call on you to respond to  the  aspect  which
is pertinent to the portfolio.

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION:  Chairperson,  he  was  talking  about
changing the paint on the roof. [Interjections.] I do not  paint  roofs.  He
talks about an investigation that has  been  undertaken.  He  does  not  say
anything about it. He says ... [Interjections.]

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Mr Chairperson, on a point  of  order:  In  general,  the
thrust of the hon the Minister's response in Xhosa  was:  ``I  do  not  deal
with dogs.'' [Interjections.] Now, we have already had ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, on  that  issue  I
will await the translation to see if that was indeed the case.  I  will  not
take it as a point of order immediately  because  there  is  a  contestation
around it.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Thank you, Mr  Chairperson.  I  would  appreciate  it  if
Hansard could record the words used correctly. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, may  I  call  upon
you please to concentrate on the matter in hand. The matter in hand  is  the
adjustments estimate. I would like you to deal with that and  to  deal  with
the issues, and try  and  curb  the  emotions  that  are  surrounding  these
issues.

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, with regard to the  youth
of this country, first of all, there was no  question  but  I  am  going  to
respond in this way. The youth of this country,  quite  correctly,  want  to
play sport.  I have no reason to doubt that. The member then goes on to  say
that I want to change the colour of the paint on the roof. I  do  not  paint
roofs. I do not have a brush, neither do I have paint. I still have to  talk
to Buffalo Timbers to give me some paint. [Interjections.]

He then goes on to say that I have wasted an amount  of  money  that  he  is
talking about. In these appropriation estimates that I have  here  in  front
of me, there is absolutely nothing about that. What is there  is  World  Cup
Legacy projects, which actually assist the youth of this country to  form  a
huge base of players so that they can go to the top to become South  African
cricket players.

There was no question from the member. The idiom which I  used  is  a  Xhosa
idiom, and if the member does not understand it, he must please come  to  me
and I will explain it, because I speak Xhosa. That is what it is all about.

Why are they overheating, on that side, like old Buicks? What they  need  to
do is to stop the engine and put in water, and  then  the  overheating  will
cease. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr S B NTULI: Mr Chairperson, I wish to commend the  National  Treasury  and
Government  for  approving  an  allocation  of  R12  million  to  Sport  and
Recreation South Africa's World  Cup  Legacy  project.  Would  the  Minister
explain how formerly disadvantaged communities that feel marginalised  would
benefit from this 2003 World Cup Legacy project, and  can  he  also  outline
the areas that have been earmarked for such developments?

The MINISTER OF  SPORT  AND  RECREATION:  Mhlalingaphambili,  enkosi  kutat'
uBheki Ntuli ndiyabulela. Chairperson, I would like to say thank you  to  Mr
Bheki Ntuli.]

Firstly, this country, with the assistance of  this  Government,  will  next
year host the most successful and spectacular Cricket World Cup with a  team
that will be embraced and supported by all South Africans  and  which  will,
in turn, win the Cricket World Cup right here at home. [Interjections.]

As for the R12,5 million that we got, Doc Craven used to say something,  but
I will not repeat what he used to say because if I  do  they  will  complain
again. So I would rather not say it. [Interjections.] I am  very  polite.  I
will not say it. Doc Craven used to talk about tall trees -  I  worked  with
him - and how wonderful to have these tall trees, but  the  only  thing  ...
Let me leave it at that. [Interjections.]

 Now, the World Cup Legacy project will build facilities  where  there  were
none before. The members who are talking  do  not  even  know  that  in  the
communities around them  there  are  no  facilities.  We  will  leave  those
facilities there as a legacy of the Cricket World Cup in our  country.  That
is why we call them legacy projects.

The likes of Mr Ray Mali, who  is  the  president  of  Border,  and  Mr  Max
Jordaan, are moving around the country, checking  on  these  facilities  and
making sure that we are ready. Here are a  few  of  the  areas  where  these
projects will be built. We are  building  a  facility  in  Kwelera  in  East
London. There is Amacal'egusha Oval at Masingatha village in King  William's
Town. A new facilty  is  going  to  be  built  in  Piri  village.  There  is
Extension 5, Joza township,  and  Gelvandale.  Charmaine  Williams  told  me
about a member who went to a  meeting  there  and  does  not  even  live  in
Gelvandale. There is Dobsonville in Soweto. Khayelitsha  Cricket  Club  will
get an oval. There is Montrose Cricket Club  near  Athlone  and  Bonteheuwel
Cricket Club. In Umtata we have an oval that we have named the Khaya  Majola
Cricket Club. So that is where all these facilities will be built.

I do not paint. I do not use paint and I do not have a brush.

Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, my question to the Minister, with reference  to
the Adjustments Appropriation  Bill,  is:  Did  he  enjoy  Jacques  Kallis's
innings of 75 not out on Saturday? [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Mr  Chairperson,  there  is  no  doubt
about it. Whenever I see that  wonderful  all-rounder  driving  through  the
covers, then I am  able  to  say:  ``South  Africa  has  good  cricketers.''
[Applause.]

Vote No 21 - Defence:

Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, I have four questions. The first  three  relate  to
the R82 million in unforeseen expenditure, and  the  first  two  to  Burundi
specifically.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: With great respect, Chairperson,  can  we  not  ask
the person operating the public address system to raise the volume?  We  are
having difficulty hearing the questioner.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Let us try. I  am  going  to  ask  the
House please to allow those who are putting questions to  do  so  unimpeded.
By your  putting  questions  to  yourselves  or  your  neighbours,  you  are
disturbing the whole process in the House. Order! I  still  hear  noises  in
the background.

Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, I have four questions. The first  three  relate  to
the R82 million in unforeseen expenditure,  and  the  first  two  are  about
Burundi.

Firstly, to what extent have foreign donors fulfilled their  commitments  to
the Burundi initiative? Secondly, is it reasonable to  expect  South  Africa
to  maintain  its  involvement  in  Burundi  virtually  alone,  against  the
background of very little progress having been made although, on  the  other
hand, this is for the benefit of the whole subregion?

The third question relates to the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development.
Were  any  reasons  submitted  to  the  Minister  by   the   Department   of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism for the fact that they did not budget  for
security purposes? Surely that was their responsibility?

The last question refers to the R180 million for  higher  salary  increases.
What  are  the  main  constraints  preventing  the   finalisation   of   the
rationalisation process in Defence, and when is  it  anticipated  that  this
will be completed?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, first of  all  let  me  say  that  the
countries that indicated their willingness to make  a  contribution  towards
funding the mission in Burundi have,  to  a  very  large  extent,  complied.
Perhaps I should rather say that they have, in fact,  complied,  except  for
one country that has only partially responded, so far.

Belgium promised, at the beginning of that mission, a sum of  R54,8  million
and we were able to  receive  that  funding  by  28  March  this  year.  The
European Union pledged an amount of R76,4 million, which we were  privileged
to receive on 19 March this year. The Netherlands pledged  R52  million,  of
which R17,6 million has now been delivered, and we expect the balance to  be
delivered any time now. The UK pledged an amount of R24,8 million, and  that
money was delivered in full by 21  August  this  year.  Norway  pledged  R12
million, which we received in August. There was a  commitment  from  the  US
that was not quantified, and nothing has  been  forthcoming  so  far.  Italy
pledged R3,1 million, which we received in August of this year.

 To  all  intents  and  purposes,  therefore,  all  of  those  international
organisations and countries that made pledges  and  commitments  to  support
the initiative  have  done  so,  and  we  are  confident  that  those  whose
contributions are outstanding will still do so.

The question has been raised, of course - I have dealt with it  before,  but
it seems I will have to deal with it once again - of  whether  South  Africa
alone should carry the  burden  of  peace  initiatives  in  our  region  and
continent. I think we have made the point, first and foremost, that  we  are
not going into these missions alone. Even though, when we start  a  mission,
resources for carrying that mission out may not  be  available  immediately,
members of the international community do come along with us  and,  as  this
report shows, do their best to respond and fulfil whatever commitments  they
have made.

Going beyond that, I have said to the House, and I must repeat,  that  South
Africans  themselves  must  not  forget  that   in   the   drive   for   the
democratisation of this country,  we  benefited  from  the  support  of  the
international community to an extent that cannot be quoted in  money  alone.
We need to take into account countries in our  region  whose  citizens  even
lost their lives, lost their property and so on, some of them  much  smaller
economies than ours, and which have never demanded that we  pay  them  back.
It is only appropriate, as former President Mandela has reminded all  of  us
from time to time, that we do not forget the friends who  were  with  us  in
the darkest hour. It is only appropriate that we reciprocate.

But in the current situation of this region and the continent, we have  also
said that unless the countries of our continent, Africans  themselves,  take
the lead in dealing with the problems of  stabilising  the  region  and  the
continent and make sure that disasters and whatever else may  come  to  pass
are dealt with first and foremost  by  themselves,  we  are  going  to  find
ourselves in difficulties, because  many  countries  that  are  outside  our
continent will not commit their young men and women and their  resources  on
our behalf. We cannot sit back and expect others to lead us. We  must  lead.
Let them support us.

It is in that spirit that our country is taking upon itself  the  burden  of
striving so determinedly  for  peace  and  stabilisation.  In  investing  in
stability in the region, we are  investing  in  the  stability  of  our  own
country. If we have a region that is unstable, we are in difficulties.

With regard to the  question  regarding  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development, I am looking around to see if  the  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism is around. I do not see him. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: He is right behind you.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: First of all, I should say,  the  Minister  is  not
here. [Interjections.] My understanding is that, first of all, there  was  a
certain budget that was set aside for the security of the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development. When those resources  had  been  deployed,  it  was
found that the actual needs were in excess of that. The  Cabinet  considered
the question as a whole and it was decided that various  departments  should
bring some of their own budgets into play so that we were  able  to  support
that major international conference for  the  sake  of  our  country,  after
which we were able to approach the Treasury to seek relief. I may  say  that
our requests were dealt with reasonably. The responsibility  for  the  World
Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  in  any  event,  was  ultimately  our
collective responsibility, and I think we handled it very well.

The  last  question,  about  the  problems  relating   to   the   issue   of
rationalisation, is a very complex question, far more complex than  many  of
us realise. Let me say, for a start, that there are a number  of  angles  to
this question. First of all we have to reduce the number of  men  and  women
in the SA National Defence Force. But, whilst  we  are  doing  that,  it  is
important to  keep  in  mind  the  right  mix  of  skills,  age  and  racial
composition, otherwise we might, after bringing  the  numbers  down  to  the
level we want, find ourselves without, for instance,  the  right  number  of
pilots of the requisite racial composition. Some members are of an  advanced
age, so we do not have the right age  composition.  It  is  a  very  complex
issue.

We are dealing with this issue competently. We are advancing  very  well  in
this regard. But there are  other  elements  outside  the  National  Defence
Force that impact on this issue and also have to be taken into account.  The
question, for instance, of the levels of education in  our  society  is  now
making itself very strongly felt. Unlike  in  the  past,  when  white  South
Africans were conscripted into the SA Defence Force, today they are not.  It
is extremely difficult today to get young white South Africans to  join  the
National Defence Force, and the reason is that  the  income  levels  in  the
white community allow them to move to other areas. When one looks  today  at
the composition of the SA National Defence Force, one sees  that  among  the
rank and file, where everybody starts, we are almost 99% black. The top  and
middle management are all white, but these are now also slowly  reducing  in
numbers, because they are leaving.

The net effect is going to be that, some years from  now,  we  will  have  a
higher percentage of black officers than has, in fact,  been  determined  in
the calculations that were set out in this Chamber. I am in the field.  Here
in the Chamber, it is easy to do  the  mathematical  equations  and  all  of
that, but once one is confronted with the  reality  of  dealing  with  those
issues, the situation is different.

I am saying, therefore, that in this balancing exercise that was begun  when
we started here, the left side sometimes goes up and the  right  side  down,
and so on. There will be no time to stop it, but  at  some  point,  the  day
South Africans are just South Africans and not white and black and  coloured
and Indian, we will just have a National Defence Force, and that is  what  I
am working towards. [Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Voorsitter, ek wil vir die agb Minister vra  -  maar  ek
sien hy gesels daar - gesien in terme van die  krisis  in  die  lugmag,  dat
daar nie eens  voldoende  fondse  is  om  vegvlieëniers  op  te  lei  of  om
genoegsame onderdele te voorsien nie: hoekom het die agb  Minister  nie  met
die Aansuiweringsbegroting voorsiening gemaak daarvoor nie?

Tweedens, in die Aansuiweringsbegroting word voorsiening gemaak  vir  'n  ex
gratia-toekenning van R350 000 as  gevolg  van  'n  arbeidsgeskil.  Die  agb
Minister is daarvan bewus dat daar ongeveer 12 lede van die Weermag  is  wat
'n pensioenprobleem het soortgelyk aan Projek Dyson 'n paar jaar gelede.  Is
dit ingesluit by die begroting? Indien nie, hoekom nie, en wat gaan die  agb
Minister daaromtrent doen?

Die MINISTER VAN VERDEDIGING: Voorsitter, ek wil eerstens  net  sê  dat  dit
waar is dat ons in die verlede probleme gehad het, maar die posisie  is  dat
die lugmag op hierdie oomblik besig is met 'n program wat geleidelik  beweeg
in die rigting van 'n oplossing. Ons is besig om die jonger mense nou op  te
lei in die lugmag, die vloot en so aan. Daardie program  gaan  oor  'n  paar
jaar hierdie probleme oplos. Dit is ongelukkig so dat  'n  mens  nie  sommer
binne 'n jaar opgeleide mense kan kry nie. Dit maak nie saak  wat  ons  wens
nie, maar dit vat tyd, en 'n mens moet met tyd werk. Ek is baie  optimisties
en ek vertrou dat in hierdie stadium ons op pad is om  hierdie  probleme  op
te los.

In verband met die hele kwessie van die pensioen-probleem, het ons die  saak
al lankal na die Kabinet geneem, en ek moet sê die Nasionale Tesourie is  op
die oomblik besig met die wetgewing. Ons is net nie  in  'n  posisie  om  te
beweeg sonder daardie wetgewing nie. Agb lede self,  in  komitees  ens,  sal
moet help om daardie wetgewing gou deurgevoer te kry. Die betrokke  Minister
is hier en hy het my verseker dat hulle amper klaar is  met  die  wetgewing.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ja, dit is wat hy vir my gesê het. [Gelag.] In elk  geval,
wat betref al daardie mense wat vir hul pensioene wag, die  Kabinet  het  al
daaroor  'n  besluit  geneem.  Die  begroting,  so  ver  ek  bewus  is,   is
beskikbaar, en dit is net 'n kwessie van die wetgewing  wat  nog  moet  kom.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, I want to ask the hon the Minister - but  I
see he is busy chatting over there - in  view  of  the  crisis  in  the  air
force, in that there are not even sufficient funds to train  fighter  pilots
or to provide enough spare parts: Why did the Minister  not  make  provision
for this within the Adjustments Appropriation?

Secondly, in the Adjustments Appropriation  provision  is  made  for  an  ex
gratia allocation of R350 000 as a result of a labour dispute. The  hon  the
Minister is aware that there are about 12 members of the Defence  Force  who
have a pension problem similar to Project Dyson a couple of  years  ago.  Is
this included in the budget? If not, why  not,  and  what  is  the  hon  the
Minister going to do about it?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, firstly I would like to  say  that  it
is true that we have had problems in the past, but the position is that  the
air force is currently engaged in  a  programme  that  is  gradually  moving
towards a solution. We are currently training the younger people in the  air
force, the navy, and so forth. That programme will  resolve  these  problems
in a few years' time. Unfortunately, one cannot simply have  trained  people
within a year. It does not matter what we would like,  it  takes  time,  and
one has to work with time. I am very optimistic and I  trust  that  at  this
stage we are on our way to solving these problems.

With regard to the whole issue of the pension problem, we  took  the  matter
to the Cabinet long ago, and I have to  say  the  National  Treasury  is  at
present dealing with the legislation. We are simply not  in  a  position  to
move without that legislation. Hon members themselves, in committees and  so
forth, will have to assist in  getting  this  legislation  implemented.  The
Minister concerned is here and he has  assured  me  that  they  have  almost
finalised the legislation. [Interjections.] Yes, that is what  he  told  me.
[Laughter.] In any event, regarding all those people  who  are  waiting  for
their pensions, the Cabinet has already taken a  decision  about  that.  The
budget, to my knowledge, is available, and  it  is  only  a  matter  of  the
legislation that is still pending in the pipeline. [Applause.]]

Mr D M DLALI: Chairperson, is it correct that the Department of Defence  has
been able to deal extensively with  its  present  mandate,  inter  alia  the
deployment of our soldiers outside the Republic for  peacekeeping  under  UN
resolutions in the Congo and Burundi and the participation of  our  soldiers
in the security of the World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  and  has
also  been  able  to  ensure  soldier  preparedness?  We  congratulate   the
Department of Defence on the work it has done so far.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, it is quite correct to say that  there
is no audit obligation that the National Defence Force has  not  dealt  with
or is not able to deal with at this time.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! If I could just prevail on  the
Whips please to assist. I think  the  Government  benches  are  the  biggest
offenders. [Interjections.] Would you come to order,  please,  so  that  the
Minister can make a proper reply. [Interjections.] Seriously, I request  the
Whips please to assist in this matter. The hon the Minister may proceed.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: The point I was making is that from  the  point  of
view of our standing obligations, the National Defence Force has  been  able
to deal with, and is capable of continuing to deal with, all of  them,  over
and above those have been the  obligations  that  have  been  ordered  as  a
result of the extensive work that  my  colleague  the  Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs has been doing under the leadership of  the  President  and  so  on.
With regard to those as well, the National Defence Force has  been  able  to
respond competently  and  efficiently  and  effectively,  and  we  are  very
cautious, in taking on obligations, not  to  stretch  the  National  Defence
Force to  breaking  point.  So  we  are  satisfied  that  there  is  nothing
foreseeable that can arise that  the  National  Defence  Force  cannot  deal
with.

Vote No 23 - Justice and Constitutional Development:

Mrs  S  M  CAMERER:  Chairperson,  as   the   Minister   for   Justice   and
Constitutional Development is aware, fraud  and  theft  have  been  and  are
being committed in his department on  a  massive  scale,  and  the  Auditor-
General wishes to pursue his forensic audit and investigation.

On 11 September, in reply to my question, the Minister told Parliament  that
his department had asked the National Treasury for R20 million  a  year  for
three years for this purpose. On 23 October  the  Minister  of  Finance,  in
reply to my question, denied that such a request had been made. There is  no
sign of an allocation  for  this  purpose  in  the  adjusted  estimates,  in
particular  under  unforeseeable  and  unavoidable   expenditure,   although
clearly it was unforeseeable that the Auditor-General  would  uncover  fraud
and  theft  on  this  scale  and  surely  it  is   unavoidable   that   this
investigation should proceed. Both Ministers are in the House today, so  the
question is: Which Minister is correct, and why  does  this  allocation  not
appear?

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  both
Ministers are correct. The issue is going to be catered for  next  year.  We
have agreed, as colleagues, that it  does  require  attention  and  we  will
indeed provide for it next year.

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, looking at the programmes that  need  adjustment,
I realise that the judges' salaries  do  have  adjustments  and  we  welcome
that. There are also adjustments in Programme 2 - Administration of  Courts,
and we welcome that too. But what makes me pull  up  short  and  tickles  my
nose is two items regarding courts. Have the salaries  of  magistrates  been
taken into account in the adjustments? The other issue, when  we  deal  with
courts, is the security of courts. Has this also been  taken  into  account?
This issue of court security worries the  magistrates  and  other  presiding
officers, as they are afraid to preside in our  courts.  We  would  like  to
know whether, in making the adjustments, these matters have been taken  into
account.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  with
regard to the first question, I am sure the hon member has looked  carefully
at page 125 of this book that the Treasury kindly provided  us  with.  There
is indeed an amount of R62,3 million which was allocated to  the  department
to cover the cost of the  higher-than-expected  salary  increases.  The  hon
member will find that the increases  in  the  salaries  of  magistrates  are
catered for under that item.

The issue of the  security  of  courts,  incidentally,  was  discussed  this
morning by the Cabinet committee dealing with justice, peace  and  security,
etc. It is an issue that is receiving the constant attention of our  cluster
as well as Government. We are already making a whole host of  interventions.
I would be the last one to deny that they may not prove to be adequate,  but
certainly the issue of the security of courts, as well as of  all  personnel
working in courts, is receiving our attention.

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, the explanatory note to Programme 5  -  Auxiliary
and Associated Services on  page  125  indicates  that  the  amount  of  R12
million reflects a reduction in the  amount  appropriated  to  the  National
Crime Prevention Strategy. In a country  with  high  crime  levels,  can  we
afford this reduction of  funds  spent  on  the  National  Crime  Prevention
Strategy? What was the motivation for this reduction?

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  if
the hon member were to read a little further, beyond  the  comma  there,  he
would see a reference to these funds being shifted to administration. It  is
not as though the reduction is to be implemented because we have no use  for
the money. We look at the figures and at better ways  of  managing  whatever
we are doing, and then we shift the money.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  I  have  been
requested to go back to the Correctional Services Vote because a member  did
not hear me announcing it. With the  leave  of  the  House,  may  I  do  so?
[Interjections.]

HON MEMBERS: No!

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  are
we through with Vote 23?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, we are through with  Justice  and
Constitutional Development. [Interjections.]

Vote No 20 - Correctional Services:

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Chairperson, the members do agree. [Interjections.] I  say
so.

Will the Minister of Correctional Services, in the coming  year,  prioritise
the process of reviewing and reinforcing the  White  Paper  on  Correctional
Services? It is my view  that  doing  so  would  enable  the  Department  of
Correctional Services to carry on with  its  business  confidently,  knowing
that there is a policy in place.

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Mr Chairperson, the hon  member,  who
is the chairperson of the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Correctional  Services,
guessed correctly that I wanted to say  something  about  this,  so  I  will
answer him.

First let me say that we will, in fact, give priority  to  the  White  Paper
process next year, for several reasons. Firstly, I think it should be  noted
that  Correctional  Services  is  evolving.  The  concept   of   corrections
presupposes just that. Together with Justice,  the  SAPS  and  Intelligence,
Correctional Services is central to the criminal justice system.  Therefore,
by implication and practice, it is part of  the  National  Crime  Prevention
Strategy. What we are seeking to do with the White Paper is to  locate  that
process properly.

 Secondly, I think the public have  so  far  refused  to  view  Correctional
Services  or  the  prisons   as   just   concrete   archipelagos   of   mere
incarceration. They have asked us to move  on  to  establish  and  focus  on
rehabilitation and restorative justice. They have  asked  us  to  fight  the
scourge of HIV and Aids in prisons. The public have  requested  us  to  deal
progressively with the  question  of  women  and  children  and  infants  in
prisons, with the issue of the disabled in prisons and also with  the  issue
of education and training and of prison labour - simply to reconcile  prison
labour with the external labour market forces and also the trade unions,  as
one member is beginning to bark behind me. [Interjections.]

Thirdly - and this is my last point - Correctional Services is  also  viewed
as an integral part of governance. To contribute towards good governance  we
have to put in place anticorruption measures which also include the  process
which is going ahead presided over by Justice Jali in  order  to  assist  in
good governance. The process of the White Paper next year will assist us  in
relocating  Correctional  Services  properly  in  the   whole   process   of
governance.

Vote No 24 - Safety and Security:

Adv P S SWART: Chairperson, through you to the Minister,  visiting  most  of
the presidential police stations identified by President Mbeki in his  state
of the nation address 20 months ago, we found  no  discernible  improvements
nor any real difference from the average police station, being  understaffed
and underresourced. The Minister should invite the President to visit  these
police stations,  where  he  can  explain  to  the  hard-working,  dedicated
members what happened to his undertakings.

I want to ask the Minister if the fact that crime increased in eight of  the
14 presidential station areas in the past financial year, combined with  the
fact that there are, in  most  instances,  now  fewer  detectives  at  these
stations than before the President's  promise,  was  unforeseeable.  If  so,
does he intend to use some of the additional almost  R85  million  allocated
for detective services to rectify this unacceptable situation?

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, firstly I want to  explain
what happens in terms of the resources that we have. I think  people  should
appreciate that there is a lot of  strategic  thinking  now  within  the  SA
Police Service. What happened immediately  the  President  identified  these
particular station areas was that the police sat down and did an  assessment
of the sociology of the affected areas that included  the  types  of  crime,
the regularity of occurrence of those crimes and many other things  relevant
thereto. In the end, the resources,  both  human  and  material,  that  were
deployed had to be equal to the needs of the given areas. This  is  what  we
did.

In June this year, during my speech on my  Vote,  I  did  indicate  to  this
House what had happened up to that point. I want to reiterate this  so  that
we can understand what has happened. It does not help to go  into  any  area
and not understand this background, because surveys that people do will  not
respond to the issues that we are dealing with.

I just want to pick up on a few examples of what has happened. Let  us  take
the Thabong station, for  instance.  In  Thabong,  at  the  point  when  the
President announced this project, there were 145 police  officials,  because
we had determined that that was the number that was necessary to  deal  with
the situation there. But afterwards I told this House in June that this  had
risen to 198 police officials. They had at that point  30  vehicles,  but  I
said we had added eight vehicles. It is, as I say, about human  as  well  as
material resources.

We could go through a number of these stations. I know  that  an  issue  has
arisen with respect to Mitchells Plain. It is true  that  we  had  wanted  a
contingent of 477 police officials for Mitchells  Plain.  To  date  we  only
have 300, but let me indicate to hon members what is going to be  happening.
There  are  153  new  functional  entry-level  recruits  and  49  additional
detectives who have already  been  identified  and  are  being  trained  for
deployment in Mitchells Plain.

 It is not correct to say that we are not  responding  to  these  issues.  I
could go through all the presidential stations, which I  did  in  June.  The
record is there. Hon members will see the additions we  made  to  human  and
material resources. We have supplied all of these stations  with  computers,
which are necessary, for instance, in terms of the  control  and  monitoring
of case dockets. In other words it is incorrect  to  say  that  nothing  has
happened. I want to admit that there are areas where there  are  still  some
problems. I have already referred here to the issue at Mitchells Plain.  But
there are more police areas where an advance has been made.

Ms ANNALIZÉ VAN WYK: Chairperson, does the  amount  appropriated  include  a
request by you for an additional amount for training in  the  light  of  the
increased training requirements that the new SAPS recruits bring with  them?
What is the amount and is the Minister satisfied that it is sufficient?

The MINISTER OF  SAFETY  AND  SECURITY:  Chairperson,  there  can  never  be
adequate funds for the work that we  do,  but  we  are  satisfied  that  the
amount we have been given is going to give us the  mobility  we  require  to
deal with crime in this country.

There is a significant  allocation  for  purposes  of  training.  We  should
remember that there is continuous training that is  designed  to  equip  our
people to deal with the changes that are happening also with regard  to  the
commission of crime in this country. There is another level of training  for
specific kinds of police officials. These are people whom we  are  going  to
be deploying in fields such as sector  policing.  Some  of  these  are  also
going to be deployed in areas where we do not have such a deployment.

There is something new that we are going to be doing, but we  are  going  to
come before this House to report on this matter. Already  we  are  beginning
to put in place the initial stages of this. We require  a  new  division  in
the  police  which  is  going  to  be  responsible  for  the  security   and
protection, in the main, of national key  points.  This  function  is  being
handled in co-operation with a number  of  other  departments,  but  we  are
going to establish this particular division.

Some of these funds therefore relate to these areas where we  are  going  to
be training people for specific functions which, at the moment,  of  course,
are different from the regular training with respect  to  the  upgrading  of
our human resources so that we can attend to issues of crime.
Vote No 25 - Agriculture:

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I would like to ask the Deputy Minister  if
any requests have been  made  to  Treasury  for  additional  funds  for  the
Agricultural Research Council in the light of  the  fact  that  243  of  the
staff have resigned and three directors have left the council because  twice
in the past three years they did not receive any salary increases.

I am also asking this in the light of the fact that  Government's  one  hand
does not always know  what  the  other  hand  is  doing.  On  one  hand  the
President puts agricultural science in Africa high on the Nepad  development
agenda, but in the meantime the personnel and the expertise are leaving  the
department. On the other hand the Deputy President says that  he  will  help
Zimbabwe  in  terms  of  agriculture  and  farm   labourers   who   are   in
difficulties, but in the meantime the personnel are resigning by the  dozen.
Something has to be done, and I ask this purely because it is  an  important
asset. What is happening there?
The DEPUTY MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  we
completely agree - and the President has given the lead  on  this  matter  -
regarding the importance of agricultural research, but I think for the  real
answer to the question of the hon Van Niekerk we must go  and  look  at  the
Main Budget, where the growth in the Agricultural Research Council's  budget
is indicated quite clearly.

Let me give these details to  the  hon  member.  He  knows  that  from  R302
million in 1998 there was a  decline  in  the  budget  for  two  years,  but
according to the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework it is  R275  million  for
2002-03, which is already  more  than  the  year  before,  climbing  in  the
following year to R284 million and in 2004-05  to  R303  million.  In  other
words, the matter is being rectified  and  that  instruction  regarding  the
importance of agricultural research is being followed.

 The hon member must just remember that  the  ARC  budget  is  part  of  the
budget of the Department of Arts,  Culture,  Science  and  Technology.  Once
that department gets the money in its budget, a fixed amount is  transferred
to  Agriculture.  I  can  assure  the  hon  member  that  the  Ministry  for
Agriculture and Land Affairs, as well as the Department of  Agriculture,  is
continuously  agitating  for  growth  in  the  budget  of  the  Agricultural
Research Council.

Mnr S ABRAM: Voorsitter, dit is droog in die mielieproduserende  streke  van
ons land. Met die El Niño-verskynsel lyk dit vir my dat droogte ons  in  die
gesig staar, en daar gaan moeilike tye  voorlê.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, it is dry in the maize-producing  regions  of  our
country. With the El Niño phenomenon it seems to me that  we  are  facing  a
drought, and that there are difficult times ahead.]

According to the adjustments estimate an additional R10,7 million  is  going
towards expected  salary  increases  and  R4,14  million  is  going  towards
surveillance of foot-and-mouth disease. We are now free  of  foot-and-mouth,
and I see that the hon the Deputy Minister of Foreign  Affairs  is  smiling.
He has been helping us get contracts overseas, which we appreciate. We  need
to spend that kind of money.

But there is something I need to find out. With the  spectre  of  a  drought
looming, Programmes 2, 5 and 6 are extremely important programmes. The  sort
of funding that we have available in the adjustments estimate is only  going
to cover peripheral issues.  When  the  real  issues  hit  us,  do  we  have
sufficient funding to assist these three programmes to survive?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Yes,  Chairperson,  I
completely agree with the hon member that those are the important ones,  but
we are not doing nothing about them. Let us just take one  example  of  what
he is referring to, the question of foot-and-mouth controls. We  are  making
additional funds available to prevent  the  disease  from  breaking  out  in
South Africa again. I must say that the most serious concern at  the  moment
is on the border between South Africa and  Zimbabwe.  There  is  information
now of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth 8 km from the border. We are  currently
taking the strictest measures to prevent it coming over that border. I  will
speak directly  to  the  member  about  what  we  are  doing;  it  is  quite
something.

But the outbreak is 8 km from the border.  If  it  crossed  the  border,  it
would cost a lot more than the additional R3,5 million that we are going  to
put in now. We have to look  at  that  border  fence,  because  it  is  very
difficult to keep it in place. Our officials are working  overtime,  through
the night, to make certain that no cattle get over  that  border.  In  fact,
recently we paid out R1 million extra in overtime.

I am just as concerned about the effect the El Niño phenomenon will have  on
maize production  in  particular,  and  also  on  other  small  grains.  Our
production of maize, as the basic staple food of South Africa, must be  such
as to enable us to feed our people and export some as well. I  think  it  is
going well at the moment, because the farmers have been able to  pay  a  lot
of their debts during the present  good  season.  We  hope  that  that  will
continue into the next season. The  food  support  that  is  going  to  come
through the Department of Social Development is almost R400 million, as  was
referred to earlier today.

I thank the hon member for the question, and I will talk to him later  about
the foot-and-mouth issue.

Vote No 27 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism:

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson, we understand that, owing  to  unforeseen  and
unavoidable circumstances, the  budget  of  the  Johannesburg  World  Summit
Company, Jowsco, incurred expenses in excess of R157,6 million. My  question
is: Are there any other countries that were supposed also to foot the  bill,
but did not fulfil their obligations? I also want to know what  will  happen
to the equipment that was bought by Jowsco,  for  example  their  computers,
since the department had to incur these expenses.

Furthermore, I  want  to  know  about  the  poverty  relief  projects  which
previously fell under tourism and are now being transferred to  biodiversity
and heritage, amounting to R20 million. My problem is this:  Will  there  be
any capacity-building for those who will now  handle  these  poverty  relief
funds, since people need them most? The issue  of  poverty  alleviation  was
debated in  this  House  and  now  this  problem  has  been  transferred  to
biodiversity and heritage. What will happen now?

 The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS  AND  TOURISM:  Chairperson,  on  the
first question, we had what is regarded internationally,  and  even  in  our
own country, as a rather unusual  situation,  with  a  number  of  countries
donating money towards the financing of  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development. I should say to the hon member that there was no obligation  on
any other country to assist with  the  funding  of  the  World  Summit.  The
obligation rests solely on the South African Government and on South  Africa
as such.

Nonetheless we did make an appeal to a number  of  countries  to  assist  in
contributing, and I am  pleased  to  report  to  this  House  that  we  have
received from various countries a total amount of R109 million  towards  the
funding of the World Summit on Sustainable Development  quite  directly.  In
addition to that, a number of countries spent  quite  large  sums  of  money
putting up exhibitions  at  the  Ubuntu  Village  and  the  Water  Dome  and
engaging in various  other  side  events  that  took  place  in  and  around
Johannesburg during the World Summit.

The overspending is not due to a lack of  response  by  donor  countries,  I
must say. The overspending is simply a case of it not being possible,  on  a
number of items, to do an exact, detailed calculation at the  time  when  we
budgeted for the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  taking  into
account that an exercise of this size was really outside the  experience  of
anybody in South Africa. One of the areas that we had to ensure  we  catered
for adequately was information technology.  We  had  to  make  use  of  vast
information technology resources in order to ensure that  the  thousands  of
journalists who were here from  all  around  the  world  would  be  able  to
transmit both electronic material and their stories quickly all  around  the
world. We also had to ensure that the entire  registration  system  for  the
tens of thousands of people who  participated  in  the  summit  events  took
place in a proper manner.

As far as equipment is concerned, much of the equipment  that  was  procured
for the summit will go into the existing use of line  function  departments,
security departments, etc. As far as  the  hon  member's  specific  question
about computer equipment is concerned, most of  the  computer  hardware  was
donated by Hewlett-Packard. Computers worth  between  R30  million  and  R40
million were donated by Hewlett-Packard. That is one of the biggest private-
sector donations that we received. The agreement that we have with  Hewlett-
Packard is that  the  equipment  will  now  go  directly  into  communities,
schools, etc.

The  hon  member  will  know  that  at  the  World  Summit  on   Sustainable
Development, the CEO of Hewlett-Packard came down from the US and,  together
with President Mbeki, launched a new community global  e-community  project.
A community in the Limpopo province will be targeted as  one  of  the  three
communities  around  the  world  for  which  there  will  be  very  detailed
information technology training taking place,  so  that  will  go  into  use
there.

We have not as yet closed off all of the books  of  the  Johannesburg  World
Summit Company, and so some of the other equipment at  this  stage  has  not
yet been allocated. This will be done, hopefully, by the end of this year.

As far as the shifting of the poverty relief funds  is  concerned,  the  hon
member will know that the Department of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism
administers quite a large chunk of Government's poverty relief funds.  These
are generally used in two areas: in the area of tourism and in the  area  of
biodiversity and the environment in general.

All of the poverty relief  funds,  apart  from  creating  direct  jobs,  are
generally aimed at ensuring, at the same time,  that  a  certain  amount  of
capacity-building is done in terms  of  training,  so  each  project  has  a
training component attached to it. Each of  those  projects  also  generally
leaves some or other sort of value. For example, the tourism projects  would
be aimed at improving the tourism product that we have in this  country,  so
they  would  include  building  walking  trails,  putting  up  signage   and
improving existing facilities at tourism  spots.  It  is  not  just  poverty
relief for the sake of it, but poverty relief, in fact, which increases  the
overall asset base of the country.

As  far  as  biodiversity  and  heritage  and  environment   generally   are
concerned,  here  again  this  would  involve   rehabilitation   work,   the
protection of the environment, biodiversity, a lot of work  that  goes  into
the parks as such and again a training component. An amount of  R20  million
has been shifted - bear in mind that this  is  over  all  nine  provinces  -
mainly on the basis of the nature of the applications that we get.

The hon member must remember that the poverty relief projects  are  not  all
designed by national Government.  We  make  a  call  on  local  governments,
provinces and also local communities and  nongovernmental  organisations  to
submit proposals for poverty relief projects in a prescribed  format.  These
proposals are scrutinised and shortlisted, and then sent  to  the  provinces
for the provinces to  approve.  Legally  we  do  not  need  to  consult  the
provinces, but we have an  agreement  with  the  provinces  that  they  will
approve projects for the provinces. Once they are  approved,  then  we  give
the  go-ahead  at  national  Government  level.  It  so  happens  that  this
adjustment is necessary in order to cater for the  nature  of  the  projects
that have come in.

Vote No 29 - Land Affairs:

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, just a quick question. I note that R50  million  is
being sought for restitution and land reform under Programmes 4  and  5.  Is
the hon the Deputy Minister satisfied that we will  be  able  to  carry  out
these projects during the course of this financial year? Does he  feel  that
it is sufficient or does he feel that it falls short?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  if  the
hon member is asking me whether I feel the  amount  is  sufficient,  let  me
tell him what we asked for. He should first remember that  under  the  roll-
overs there are three projects that are in midair at the  moment.  We  asked
for a roll-over of R41 million just for those three  projects.  So  that  is
R40 million that is actually part of the present allocation.

But under ``unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditure''  we  requested  R160
million and got R50 million, but  that  is  the  kind  of  control  that  is
understandable from a macroeconomic perspective. As the  hon  member  knows,
we have  all  kinds  of  very  good  plans.  It  is  going  very  well  with
restitution at the moment. We are over the halfway mark.  We  won  the  case
against the Transvaal Agricultural Union, so the reaction of that  party  is
out. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Carry on, hon Deputy Minister.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  We  are  expecting,
regarding urban claims, a lot from the standard settlement offers, but  this
will cost more money. We will just see how far we can go. The  Treasury  was
actually quite generous with this R50 million, which will be  split  between
land reform and restitution as well.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Voorsitter, my vraag gaan oor staatsgrond  en  die  hervorming
en oordrag daarvan. Slegs 140 000 hektaar van 'n  beplande  1,4  miljoen  is
gerapporteer as oorgedra, ek dink dit was  in  Maartmaand  vanjaar  -  slegs
0,5% persent van die 25 miljoen hektaar staatsgrond en slegs 19 400  ha  oor
drie en 'n half jaar. Ons weet dit kos geld om hierdie grond oor te dra  vir
ontwikkeling.  Beoog  die  agb  Adjunkminister  om   hierdie   oordrag   van
staatsgrond te bespoedig en dat hy enigsins in die res  van  hierdie  termyn
wat oorbly hierdie bespoediging sal kan uitvoer? (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, my question deals with state land and its  reform
and transfer. Only 140 000 ha of a planned 1,4  million  hectares  has  been
reported as having been transferred, I think it was in March of this year  -
only 0,5% of the 25 million hectares of state land and only  19  400  ha  in
three and a half years. We know it costs money to  transfer  this  land  for
development. Does the hon the Deputy  Minister  envisage  speeding  up  this
transfer of state land and that he will in any way, in  the  remaining  part
of this period, be able to implement this acceleration process?]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson, I do  not
think the hon member's question about the  transfer  of  state  land  really
takes into account land that is being leased out. The  leasing  question  is
creating a problem for the timing of this matter. We are rolling  over  R5,6
million, if I remember correctly, for the transfer of state land.  But  that
is the area in which we are going to deliver quite well in the next year.

 The hon member must also remember that this is under delegation - in  other
words, the work is actually being done in the provinces,  which  are  nearer
to where the state land is situated, so a co-operative model determines  the
mechanics that we use in this regard. We are planning to  roll  it  out  far
better, because that is the first instance of delivery in land reform.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson,  my  question  relates  to  restitution  and  the
additional  amount  of  just   over   R68   million   in   the   Adjustments
Appropriation. My question refers particularly to  claims  from  the  people
who lived in District Six. During one's constituency visits one often  comes
across people complaining that they are not being paid out, that  the  state
is dragging its feet with regard to paying out and so on - not so much  from
those people who rented property, but particularly  from  those  people  who
owned their own homes in District Six.

There is a process, and we are glad about that. They are starting  to  build
and to finalise this  programme.  What  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Deputy
Minister is: To what extent is any of this funding  involved  with  District
Six, or is he quite happy and quite sure that the people who put  in  claims
will have their claims met?
The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson,  that  is
exactly what I said in my previous answer: that, if we really say  what  our
commitments are, we are talking about R160 million which we need now, so  it
has to be spread out.

What I must say is that the hon member must take into account that  District
Six is a really historical claim, so the payments will come  on  account  of
the validation of those claims. In most of the  urban  areas,  the  standard
settlement is promising a lot, although that would not  be  the  case  in  a
situation like that of District Six.

The standard settlement offer will only apply to urban  areas  where  people
are already settled. Claimants have indicated in urban areas  that  they  do
not wish to experience the  pain  of  moving  again  from  where  they  were
removed to and settled over many years. That is part of the problem, so  the
standard procedure can really speed up the urban  claims.  But  as  for  the
specific details of District Six, if the hon member  wants  to  talk  to  me
about that or address a query to the  department,  I  will  handle  it  with
pleasure.

Vote No 32 - Transport:

Mr J P CRONIN: Chairperson, I listened very carefully  to  the  Minister  of
Finance ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Order!  Hon  members,  I  will
have to call you by name. I have tried to restrain  myself  from  doing  so,
but if you are not going to come to order, hon Borman, I  will  have  to  do
that. I understand that hon members have had a long day, but we need to  try
to advance the process. The hon member may proceed.

Mr J P CRONIN: Chairperson, I think that the Minister  of  Finance  will  be
taking the question. The public transport in Tokyo is very  good,  which  is
why the weather in Tokyo is an irrelevant, or largely irrelevant, issue.

I listened carefully to his responses in the debate  earlier  in  regard  to
the two predictable unforeseeables in this Transport budget, namely the  bus
subsidy issue and the commuter rail issue, and I am sure the  other  parties
will also be raising this. The Minister's responses basically said,  in  the
case of the bus subsidies, that the problem there is that  there  are  still
some lifetime contracts. We have passed legislation to get rid  of  lifetime
contracts for all the obvious reasons, but obviously there  is  slowness  in
implementing it. That is something that we need to look at.  My  concern  is
that we must not make the assumption  that  the  subsidisation  of  commuter
buses will necessarily go down in terms of gross amounts  if  we  move  away
from lifetime contracts. It should become a lot more rational, but  the  sum
might not go down, and so the question is: Is that also an  assumption  that
is being made in Treasury?

And then, related to commuter rail, I  also  agree  with  the  response  the
Minister gave that part of  the  problem  is  that  we  have  a  bit  of  an
organisational spaghetti, that the funding goes  to  the  SA  Rail  Commuter
Corporation and then, in a complicated and probably  duplicating  way,  gets
passed on to Metrorail. This is something that we have to sort out  so  that
we do not keep coming back to this problem year after year.

 However, our belief, as the ANC, is that it is not just this  institutional
arrangement  that  is   contributing   to   problems.   There   is   serious
underfunding, basically, of commuter rail, and we need to have not  just  an
adjustment annually, but a paradigm shift  in  terms  of  commuter  rail.  I
would like to know whether the Minister agrees that this  is  a  possibility
that needs to be looked at.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, the short answer is, yes. Part of  the
reason is that the entire system needs to be overhauled, and resolving  that
requires that the institutional arrangement between  Metrorail  and  the  SA
Rail Commuter Corporation should be resolved.

Members will be aware, I am sure, of the extensions of the lines in  respect
of both Khayelitsha and the new loop facility in Umtata.  Rolling  out  that
also requires that attention be given both there and in respect of  existing
commuter rail facilities dealing with issues such as  signalling  and  other
facilities that provide high  levels  of  safety  for  commuter  rail.  That
expenditure is going to be big.

In addition, there is money on the budget for capital stock,  especially  in
respect of rolling stock, and so changes will come. But supporting  that  in
terms of the present arrangement will also require that additional money  be
made available to ensure that we have functional  commuter  rail  facilities
in all cities.

Mr S B FARROW: Chairperson, I think the hon Cronin has stolen my thunder  to
a degree, but would it not then be  important  that  the  Minister  actually
start moving these bus subsidies into the hands of the  commuters,  so  they
actually get the subsidy and not the buses at the end of the day?

Let me just talk about the whole budget and  the  lack  of  funding  in  it.
Needless to say, the R488,6 million or so additional funding that was  given
is insufficient, when one considers the funding needs for taxis  and  buses,
the rail subsidies and the capital needs for both rail  and  road,  which  I
will emphasise. It has been estimated that there are backlogs  to  the  tune
of about R65 billion.

Would  the  Minister  consider  -  and  this  as  a  ``tip  for  Trevor''  -
channelling funds for this purpose into a dedicated road fund from the  fuel
levy, which is ostensibly for that purpose, and apportioning  them  back  to
the provinces as conditional grants? Would he agree that, in  the  light  of
some of the 200 000 km of rural roads identified nationwide,  and  the  need
for new roads, funding can no longer be continuously supported  through  the
extension of toll roads,  which  is  seen  by  many  road  users  as  double
taxation?

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, in respect of a  road  fund,  part  of
the difficulty with dedicated funding is the fragmentation  of  the  fiscus.
If departments that could fund  themselves  through  dedicated  charges  did
that on a continuous basis,  there  would  be  no  resources  left  to  fund
education, health and so on, and the poorest would always come off worst  in
those kinds of situations. There is an assumed, built-in allowance  in  fuel
prices to take account of this, but it is dealt with in such a  manner  that
the resource is entirely fundable.

In respect of  the  extent  of  backlogs,  I  think  there  will  always  be
differences. The Southern African Bitumen Association -  some  call  it  the
``bitching men's association'' - would have  their  own  views  about  these
issues. In other respects I think that our road network is  reasonable,  but
the breakdown, I think, comes  more  in  respect  of  local  government  and
especially in rural areas. Those links are probably the  most  underserviced
links, and so looking at a fund that  deals  with  national  and  provincial
government  to  the  exclusion  of  local  government  is   probably   quite
disastrous for the poorest of our people, who reside in rural areas.

Clearly there is a set of  issues  that  we  have  to  deal  with.  Part  of
resolving  especially  the  challenges  in  respect  of  both  primary   and
secondary roads is to  effect  substantial  improvements  in  freight  rail,
because that is where the difficulties are coming in.  We  have  to  replace
our roads too frequently because of the loads on  axles  travelling  on  our
roads, and  that  becomes  a  big  challenge.  So  improved  management  and
improved flexibility in freight rail are an important part of resolving  the
challenge in financing roads going forward.

But let me repeat what  I  said  earlier,  namely  that  the  Department  of
Transport, in collaboration with a number of other departments,  is  working
on a policy framework for road transport going forward,  and  I  think  that
they will be in a position, early in the new  year,  to  place  that  policy
framework before Parliament for consideration. Then we  will  have  clarity,
and that clarity must deal with a  combination  of  road  freight,  commuter
buses and, of course, taxis, and the intermodal utilisation of transport  to
ensure that we can maximise efficiencies, because we should say  that  there
probably is a  high  degree  of  inefficiency  within  the  present  subsidy
arrangements as well.
Vote No 33 - Water Affairs and Forestry:

Mr S SIMMONS: Chairperson, hon Minister, are there any additional funds  for
community  water  services  envisaged?  It  appears  from  the   Adjustments
Appropriation Bill that no provision has been made for  these  services.  Is
it possible  to  transfer  funds  within  the  department's  budget  through
virement  approval  to  address  the  serious  concerns  of  the   following
municipalities?

Many villages in the Nkangala district municipality in Mpumalanga  had  been
without water for  three  to  four  weeks  at  the  time  of  the  portfolio
committee's visit to the area in April  2002.  When  the  committee  sat  to
consider the matter very seriously and approve the reports, it was  reported
that the same villages were still without water, up  to  six  months  later.
The Hamulima municipality in the  Limpopo  province  reported  that  it  had
insufficient underground water and that boreholes did not fulfil  the  water
demand. The El Niño drought  will  aggravate  the  situation.  The  hon  the
Minister will agree that the situation in the  said  two  municipalities  is
serious, hence the question.

The  MINISTER  OF  WATER  AFFAIRS  AND   FORESTRY:   Yes,   Chairperson,   I
wholeheartedly agree. There is no  adjustment,  however.  We  do  have  R1,2
billion for the community water programme.

In respect of the two areas the hon member referred to,  the  Nkangala  area
is in the former KwaNdebele, a vast area  of  5 000  square  kilometres  and
750 000 people. The problem there is that the water board in Nkangala has  a
single system. As the hon member probably knows from his visit, there  is  a
single pipeline serving hundreds of villages. The problem with this is  that
those who benefit earlier from that pipeline are  extracting  large  amounts
of water. In Kwaggafontein people are consuming as much as  100  litres  per
day each. Further down the line, then, there is not sufficient water.

In the height of summer, in hot weather, people higher up that pipeline  use
excessive  amounts  of  water  and  those  lower  down  that  pipeline   are
suffering, as the hon member has seen. I have been discussing this with  the
Nkangala municipality and with the water board, and we even  had  the  Human
Rights Commission coming on board.

The only way in which we can improve matters in the short  term  is  through
greater discipline and co-operation from the  villages  so  that  those  who
benefit earlier do not do so at the  expense  of  those  who  receive  water
later. We are dealing with that  from  an  integrated  management  point  of
view, tackling such problems as the illegal connections which abound in  the
area.

The longer term solution is a question  of  two  years,  and  that  involves
improving the system. We are dealing with that. The Human Rights  Commission
has, in fact, said that it is satisfied with the way  we  are  handling  the
issue. That is according to a letter I received about two months ago.

The Limpopo area that the hon member referred to - the  municipality  is  in
the Tshitapa area - is an area with very big  problems.  Fortunately,  there
is the groundwater supply. It is insufficient. We  are  in  the  process  of
building the Nondoni Dam. It will be completed within two to three years.  A
pipeline from Nondoni will come to the rescue  of  many,  many  thousands  -
hundreds of thousands - of people in that part of Limpopo.

If the El Niño effect is as acute as the hon member  indicated  earlier,  we
will have to take emergency measures. But I  beg  to  differ  with  the  hon
member. My reading of El Niño is that it is coming, but the predictions  are
that it is not expected to be severe. If it is, we will deal with it  as  an
emergency, as my hon predecessor did at the time of  the  previous  El  Niño
occurrence.

Regarding the constitutional rights issue, I  have  reported  on  the  Human
Rights Commission. They accept that Government is doing  everything  it  can
in the reasonable sense and in terms of the limited amount of funding  which
the hon the Minister of Finance has to dole out to  all  these  departments.
We are doing our best and with the R1,2 billion  this  year  and  in  coming
years, we are really getting there. By 2008 every single South African  will
be receiving clean, safe water. [Applause.]

Vote No 35 - Science and Technology:

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  a
question. If I heard the Deputy Minister for Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs
correctly when I asked him a question  on  agricultural  research,  he  said
that he would leave  no  stone  unturned  to  increase  the  budget  of  the
Agricultural Research Council. My question to this Minister, who deals  with
the Agricultural Research Council and its  budget,  is  therefore:  Did  the
Department of Agriculture request additional funds? If they did,  how  much?
Or did the Agricultural Research Council request any funds to get  them  out
of their tremendous predicament?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Chairperson,
I will answer the question in broad terms. Firstly, it has to be  said  that
science councils will always bid for more.  Obviously  there  has  to  be  a
consideration of the whole collection  of  institutions  when  it  comes  to
funding. Let me just say that we have received a  budget  for  research  and
development and the ARC is an interested party in that budget. We are  aware
of the needs of the science councils and we are satisfied  that  the  budget
for now is adequate. There will always be a need for more. The  Minister  of
Finance will give us the details.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, part of the difficulty in the  ARC  is
that the liabilities are largely in respect of pensions and  the  leave  pay
of people who have been around for a  long  time.  We  dealt  with  that  in
respect of some of the other science councils earlier. The problem  has  not
gone away in the ARC and so, from the  perspective  of  Treasury,  there  is
still too large a transfer into those nonproductive costs, if I may  put  it
like that, and that is the issue to be resolved. We  are  working  with  the
Ministry for Agriculture and Land Affairs  to  develop  a  model  that  will
ensure that the  money  going  to  the  ARC  actually  assists  agricultural
research and not the pension and medical aid liabilities of people who  have
left long ago. [Interjections.]

Discussion on Votes and Schedule concluded.

Vote No 1 - The Presidency - put and agreed to.

Votes Nos 2 to 14 put.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, on Vote No 2 -  Parliament  I  would  like  to
rise on a point of order.  I  would  like  to  request  the  Chairperson  to
attempt to determine which hon members of  this  House  persistently  ignore
rulings  by  the  Speaker.  There  are  certain  members  who,  during   the
discussion of Vote  No  2,  again  displayed  blatantly  sexist  and  racist
behaviour towards one of the members of my party. We object to this,  and  I
think all right-thinking hon members of this House will also object.

What makes it so serious from our point of view is  that,  on  a  number  of
occasions, the Speaker has requested people to abide by her rulings and  has
appealed to them not to be sexist and racist. But  certain  hon  members  of
this House keep on showing their prejudices and treat one of my hon  members
in a blatantly sexist and racist way. I want to ask the Chair  to  determine
who those hon members are and to deal with  them  accordingly  so  that  the
rest of the world knows that those people at least do not  live  up  to  the
high principles which all of us should live up to.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, if I may address  you  on
the same question, we wish to submit that the issue that has been raised  by
the hon Chief Whip of the DP does not relate to the subject matter  of  this
particular Vote and the manner in  which  it  has  been  scheduled.  If  the
matter has to be pursued, it must be pursued outside the issue  at  hand  as
it is disposed of before this particular House. We ask you for a  ruling  in
accordance with that.

 The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Gibson, the concern raised is noted  and
will be taken up with the presiding officers, and we will  find  a  solution
to the problem. We will identify an  appropriate  structure  in  which  this
matter can be raised and discussed.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, you started by putting Votes No 2-14. On  Vote
No 2 we would now like to divide in order to  show  what  we  think  of  the
racist and sexist remarks of people from the other side. [Interjections.]

                           (First Reading debate)

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Chairperson, I see  that  there  is  a  movement  of  people
leaving the House while we are debating the Revenue Laws Amendment  Bill.  I
want to remind them that the SA Revenue Service is the goose that  lays  the
golden egg. If there are no resources coming from the  Revenue  Service  one
might get less in one's budget.

The ANC supports the Bill before the House. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon members! Order!

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Our ANC-led Government is the  most  significant  player  in
the economy and, as a custodian of democratic values in society and  of  the
economy, the Government has a key role to play in transforming the  economy,
reducing poverty, improving levels of productivity ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, can you please  take  your
seat? Hon members, can you please be seated? Order!  Hon  members,  can  you
please be seated?

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Thank you, Chairperson. To achieve these  goals,  we  tabled
the Bill to meet  these  challenges  and  to  improve  and  consolidate  our
policies. Revenue collected must be returned to the  people  to  ensure  the
socioeconomic transformation to address the imbalances in society.

There are lessons  to  be  learnt  from  the  process  that  preceded  these
proposals before us. Sars listened to the public,  received  questions  from
interested  parties  and  numerous  telephone  calls,  held  meetings,   and
received letters from concerned taxpayers. Most of these changes are due  to
this process. But, as the saying goes, one cannot satisfy all of the  people
all of the time.

During  the  hearings  our  committee  interacted  with  organisations  from
various business sectors and one common source of  dissatisfaction  was  the
time constraints placed upon them for comments,  but  they  also  understood
the pressures Sars was under during the preparation  of  this  Bill.  During
these hearings the National Treasury  and  Sars  responded  to  the  various
points of concern raised by commentators on the Bill.

The proposals in this Bill are  designed  in  favour  of  and  will  benefit
taxpayers, be they companies or individuals. The proposed  Bill  deals  with
technical corrections but does not reverse prior  tax  policies.  It  covers
five major  items  of  legislation.  The  proposals  in  the  Bill  are  the
culmination of two years of fundamental tax reform and  include  changes  to
the  rules  governing   company   reorganisations   and   foreign   currency
transactions. The Bill also  aims  to  adjust  business  travel  allowances,
removes taxation on diplomats' foreign allowances and fringe  benefits,  and
seeks to clamp down on the avoidance of transfer duties.

New rules on company mergers, acquisitions and takeovers will  allow  for  a
wider array of corporate combinations and measures to  facilitate  the  tax-
free  movement  of  foreign  assets  into  South  Africa.  However,  foreign
companies with South African branches can no longer transfer losses  into  a
newly formed South African company. The amendment lifts the restrictions  on
banks  and  insurance  companies,  allowing  them  to   reorganise   without
incurring tax liabilities.

The Bill also seeks to clarify inconsistencies concerning  foreign  currency
deals. The  foreign  currency  rules  represent  one  of  the  most  complex
features in the Income Tax Act, because foreign currency  gains  and  losses
involve all forms of foreign-related transactions. The Bill  eliminates  all
currency gains or losses for individuals  for  capital  gains  tax  purposes
from routine travel and private expenses and rationalises currency rules  by
including foreign-related income in one  basic  system.  For  companies  all
foreign-related income will be translated into rands at an average  exchange
rate for the taxable year.

Regarding transfer duties, the  Bill  aims  to  make  individuals  who  have
bought homes through a private company, trust or  close  corporation  liable
for the transfer duty. All these proposals put before  us  by  the  National
Treasury and Sars will contribute to providing and improving  a  transparent
and  client-orientated  service  to  ensure  the   optimum   and   equitable
collection of revenue.

This Bill is the result of and enforces what the Minister  outlined  in  his
Budget Speech this year when he said:


  There will be comprehensive tax policy  reform  to  further  advance  the
  restructuring of the SA Revenue Service and collection processes.

With this Bill Government will be able to continue  to  provide  tax  relief
for  individuals  and  seek  to  improve  further  the   effectiveness   and
efficiency of South African  tax  structures  with  a  view  to  encouraging
investment and reducing the cost of  doing  business  in  South  Africa.  To
assist Sars it is important to encourage individuals and businesses  in  our
constituencies to adhere to tax morality and compliance.

Finally, I am sure all members wish to thank the  Minister  and  the  Deputy
Minister and the SA Revenue Service under the leadership  of  the  director-
general, Maria Ramos, and the commissioner, Mr  Pravin  Gordhan,  for  their
commitment,  hard  work  and  dedication.  The  ANC   supports   the   Bill.
[Applause.]

 Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  there  are  two
important aspects in the Bill that need to be noted.  Firstly,  it  purports
to contain mere technical amendments or  corrections  to  major  tax  policy
changes introduced last year. However, this is not the case, as Saica  point
out in their submission. Whilst industry players were under the  impresssion
that this year would be one of consolidation, thereby  contributing  to  tax
certainty, the Bill before us introduces considerable change.

The Bill brings changes in the areas of the  residence  basis  of  taxation;
corporate reorganisation  rules  to  cater  for  mergers,  acquisitions  and
restructuring; the taxation of capital profit liquidations;  currency  rules
for capital gains  tax;  source  rules  for  capital  gains  tax  that  were
strangely omitted from the previous legislation;  a  number  of  other  CGT-
related  provisions,  including  the  alteration  of   the   definition   of
``controlled foreign entity'' to ``controlled foreign company'' to  restrict
its scope; and a number of customs and excise amendments.

The changes before us add fuel to the fire of those who warned  against  the
administrative complexity of capital gains tax in particular - a  complexity
that implies substantive change and resultant tax uncertainty.  While  these
amendments do not alter policy, they are considerable changes and  not  mere
technical corrections as the National  Treasury  maintains.  Secondly,  what
ought to be clear  is  that  those  who  opposed  policy  decisions  on  the
introduction of capital gains tax and/or the  change  from  a  source  to  a
residence basis of taxation will find it difficult  to  support  legislation
that tampers with the margins of complexity of what  are  considered  to  be
bad tax policy choices for South Africa.
In the National Treasury's submission to the committee, they state that  the
proposed  Bill  is  a  normal  consequence  of   major   tax   reform.   The
administrative  complexity  of  the  major  tax  reform  South   Africa   is
undertaking speaks clearly from  the  voluminous  Bill  we  are  considering
today  and  its  numerous  retrospective  provisions  -  always   bad   law,
irrespective of  whether  it  acts  to  the  benefit  of  taxpayers,  as  it
perpetuates tax uncertainty.

In addition, areas of uncertainty remain despite  the  changes  in  lieu  of
corporate   reorganisations,   as   consequential    amendments    to    the
Uncertificated Securities Tax Act and Value-Added Tax Act will  be  required
due to the alterations to the corporate reorganisation rules. These are  new
policy  decisions  that  will  have  to  wait  until  Budget  time,  clearly
introducing  further  uncertainty.  Saica  raised  the   question   of   the
iniquitous treatment of taxpayers due to retroactivity, and the DA  supports
Saica's call for a constitutional provision prohibiting  retroactive  fiscal
legislation.

Instead of merely having a debate on the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill  before
us, what is clearly required is a debate  on  tax  policy.  Debates  on  tax
policy and the advisability of certain tax policy changes  for  an  emerging
market economy  have  all  but  vanished,  being  replaced  by  a  technical
correction process. Instead of having robust debates on tax  policy  choices
in Parliament, Parliament is being relegated to a mere  spectator  with  tax
consultants, tax lawyers and accountants bickering over  technical  details,
while the policy decisions themselves go nearly unchallenged.  South  Africa
needs a robust debate,  particularly  on  corporate  tax  reform,  not  mere
technical tampering with the margins of new policy.

In  considering  whether  to  support  or   oppose   the   Bill,   competing
considerations arose. There is no doubt that the  Bill  seeks  to  bring  at
least greater clarity, particularly  in  crucial  areas  such  as  corporate
reorganisations, residence-based taxation and CGT. There is  no  doubt  that
many provisions  would  act  to  the  potential  benefit  of  the  taxpayer.
However, this has to be seen against the broader background  that  the  Bill
before us furthers tax policy decisions that were not seen by the DA  to  be
in the interests of the needs of an emerging market economy  such  as  South
Africa's; policy decisions that bring great  administrative  complexity  and
resultant uncertainty, as this Bill attests; policy decisions that, in  some
areas, were not sufficiently thought through or articulated, but now  result
in undesirable retroactive provisions, with the biggest issue in  this  Bill
being the question of effective dates.

 For all these reasons, the DA cannot support this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Chairperson, this is one of the busier Revenue Laws  Amendment
Bills that we in the Portfolio Committee on Finance have had  to  deal  with
in recent years, with  some  130  amending  clauses  being  proposed  across
various tax Acts. However, after working through the  very  often  technical
detail of this Bill, it  becomes  apparent  that  there  are  not  too  many
substantial issues. In fact, once one has lifted out those amendments  which
are there to deal with clumsy wording, unclear definitions and  interpretive
ambiguities, and those which  are  of  a  consequential  nature,  the  whole
exercise becomes considerably less daunting.

There are the usual number of amendments  which  are  of  an  anti-avoidance
type, which we have come to expect given  the  highly  expert  industry  out
there which exists chiefly to find loopholes and escape routes  in  our  tax
laws. Naturally, Treasury through Sars is always  having  to  play  catch-up
through such legislative amendments as are contained in this Bill, and  they
do this as and when  unacceptable  avenues  of  avoidance  and  evasion  are
discovered. However, if we note that much of Sars's growing tax  collections
and tax revenue is attributable to  the  plugging  of  these  loopholes,  it
suggests to us that Sars is now actually catching up and closing the gap  on
the industry experts. I think for this Sars deserves all  the  accolades  it
receives.

There is, however, a side to this success story which I will  briefly  refer
to. It concerns a fair number of public complaints regarding what  they  see
as the commissioner having become  overly  aggressive  in  his  approach  to
suspect actions by taxpayers. While there is some truth in this  contention,
I think we must reluctantly agree that this  toughness  has  been  necessary
for the greater good - such was the state of tax morality and the  resultant
tax gap in  the  country.  And  what  is  pleasing  is  that  now  that  the
commissioner has  captured  the  taxpayers'  attention  and  their  grudging
respect, he is  beginning  to  address  some  important  shortcomings  which
affect the public.

One is to give taxpayers better audience and constructive engagement in  the
case of disputes. Indeed, this Bill provides an example  of  this  where  it
allows for easier appeal and objection to  certain  discretionary  decisions
made by the commissioner. We also see that Sars  is  beginning  to  be  more
serious in the customer service  side  of  its  operations,  with  dedicated
service centres such as the one set up in the Western Cape  quite  recently,
and other organisational changes that are  being  introduced  to  deal  more
effectively with the taxpaying public. This is to be welcomed.
Returning to the Bill, there is some fine-tuning of the recently  introduced
residence-based tax laws. Let  us  acknowledge  that  Sars  has  defied  the
prophets of doom who predicted administrative chaos when these changes  were
introduced. In fact, the relatively few subsequent amendments in  this  Bill
are an indication of how well the change-over was planned and managed.

Likewise, to some extent for capital  gains  tax,  while  we  do  have  some
ambivalence about this  tax  as  a  matter  of  economic  common  sense  and
notwithstanding the current difficulties some are experiencing in  the  unit
trusts industry and property markets, we have to say that Sars  has  handled
the introduction of capital gains tax quite well.

Perhaps the most significant amendments of the  Bill  are  those  concerning
corporate restructuring rules. I think these caught some of us by  surprise,
not having fully appreciated the tax advantages that  were  being  exploited
through certain of these amalgamation transactions. During  its  hearing  on
the  Bill  the   Portfolio   Committee   on   Finance   entertained   strong
representation from business concerning these  changes,  but  we  are  happy
that  Sars has accommodated the more serious of their  concerns.  I  believe
that  these  amendments  to  the  original  amendments  have   resulted   in
appropriate tax arrangements.

The final amendment I will refer to concerns the Transfer Duty Act. This  is
welcome in so far as it closes  a  clear  tax  avoidance  avenue.  We  will,
however, have to monitor its effect on the property market and  the  way  it
might discourage property-owning trusts  which  otherwise  would  serve  the
interests of beneficiaries such as minors.

 Dr P J RABIE: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  members,  the  Revenue  Laws
Amendment Bill effects amendments to a number  of  tax  Acts.  A  number  of
changes in the  present  tax  legislation  are  proposed.  Entities  holding
residential property can currently avoid transfer duty through  the  use  of
companies and trusts. The Bill refines the definition of property, which  is
extended to cover an interest in a residential property or company,  and  an
interest in a company where that company would  be  a  residential  property
company if all subsidiary company assets  were  held  by  it.  A  contingent
right to residential property is also explained in legal terms.

The recovery of transfer duties is  also  covered  in  the  sense  that  the
proposed amendments extend the liability to the public officer  and  seller,
who will be jointly liable for the transfer duty should the  buyer  fail  to
pay. Any newly named  beneficiary  of  a  trust  will  also  be  liable  for
transfer duty.

On the whole I think this piece of legislation is user-friendly and I  think
we should give credit to Sars for finding  these  sorts  of  concepts  which
even make sense to lay people like myself. The residence basis  of  taxation
and controlled foreign companies are  further  defined  regarding  technical
corrections to refine wording, remove inconsistencies and  provide  clarity,
with particular reference to the taxation of the income  of  residents  from
foreign sources.
A number of currency rules  are  stipulated  and  the  double  taxation  and
taxation of foreign dividends and credits paid in respect of foreign  source
income are also defined. A very important amendment regarding  the  last-in-
first-out rule in section 9E clarifies dividends that  are  deemed  to  come
out if profits from the most recent year on a  last-in-first-out  basis  are
available  for  distribution.  What  is  significant,   however,   is   that
individual taxpayers can choose to use profits  from  a  different  year  if
they select by way of a decision by management or shareholders.

Schedule 8 of this Bill introduces source rules  for  capital  gains.  These
rules determine that the source of capital gain or loss on the  sale  of  an
immovable property will be determined to be where the immovable property  is
situated. The definition of immovable property in relation to an  individual
includes shares in a company when 80% or more of the net asset value of  the
company is attributable to immovable property and  where  the  person  holds
20% or more of the shares of  that  particular  company.  Regarding  movable
property, where the property is attributable to a  permanent  establishment,
the source of the capital gain or loss on the sale of that property will  be
determined where the permanent establishment is situated.

South Africa is becoming  an  integral  part  of  the  global  international
economy. In the case of foreign equity instruments  and  assets,  which  are
deemed to be sourced in  the  Republic,  the  full  currency  gain  or  loss
determined on disposal will  be  taxable.  In  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Finance it was clearly stated  that  expenditure  of  this  nature  will  be
translated into rands at the average  exchange  rate  for  the  year  during
which the expenditure was incurred.

The amendment to section 9D of the Income Tax Act of 1962 includes a  number
of technical changes to  provisions  on  controlled  foreign  entities  that
favour taxpayers. The New NP supports the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Mr Chairperson and hon members,  much  debate  has  already
taken place regarding the process surrounding  the  Revenue  Laws  Amendment
Bill. Two issues can be highlighted, namely the  voluminous  extent  of  the
Bill and the period allowed for public comment. We commend the  Minister  of
Finance's statement that tax policy  in  South  Africa  needs  a  period  of
consolidation. Fewer amendments  in  next  year's  Bill  will  achieve  this
envisaged consolidation and will bring more certainty into  the  system.  We
also welcome the commitment of Sars in this regard during our hearings.

Regarding the time allowed for public comment, we think that a clear  10-day
period should be afforded to the public and practitioners to comment on  the
Bill once it has  been  released,  as  suggested  by  the  SA  Institute  of
Chartered Accountants. We believe that the Minister of Finance will have  no
problem with reference to the issues  raised  above,  namely  to  bring  tax
certainty or consolidation and a fair period to comment on the Bill.

The Bill before the House  contains  three  substantive  issues,  the  first
being transfer  duty  provisions.  In  future  all  residential  properties,
whether  owned  by  a  company  or  a  trust,  will  pay  transfer  duty  on
transactions. We believe this is a fair and just proposal.

Secondly, the Bill provides for group structuring  rules  in  all  corporate
reorganisation. The Bill is extended to include banks,  insurance  companies
and similar financial institutions to reorganise in a tax-free manner.

Thirdly, the Bill contains foreign currency rules. The Bill  translates  all
foreign income and  loss  into  rands  under  a  unified  averaging  regime.
Taxpayers will be subjected to tax on their currency gains and losses.

These substantive issues are of great importance and we are  in  support  of
such amendments. The UDM agrees with the  provisions  in  the  Revenue  Laws
Amendment Bill and therefore supports the Bill.

Mr M M S LEKGORO: Chairperson and colleagues,  the  Revenue  Laws  Amendment
Bill before the House deals with a  broad  range  of  issues  and  amends  a
variety of laws with revenue implications. It brings about changes to  these
laws with the aim of ensuring efficiency, aligning the  different  laws  and
bringing our revenue laws up to speed with  current  legal  and  legislative
developments.

All the amendments in  this  Bill  are  of  a  technical  and  consequential
nature. None are of a policy  nature.  So  the  point  should  be  made  and
clarified that none of these amendments are bringing about any  new  policy.
The amendments are intended to give effect to existing  policies  and  these
are the policies that have been adopted by this House in the recent past.

My colleagues have already dealt with a variety of issues in  this  Bill.  I
will focus on the skills development  levy  area  and  the  value-added  tax
area. In the skills development levy area, it has  become  apparent  to  the
collectors that some employers do not pay their  skills  development  levies
on time. This raises all sorts of complications  for  Government  and  those
who are supposed to benefit from these levies. It is also important to  note
that nonpayment of these levies by employers deprives  the  public  and  the
state of the desired benefit,  whilst  employers  continue  to  enjoy  undue
benefits from this money illegally held by them.

It  is  therefore  only  reasonable  and  correct  for  the  state  to  take
appropriate steps to rectify this  situation  and  force  the  employers  to
comply without introducing any measures that would result in a loss of  time
and energy. So the introduction of interest on moneys not paid at  the  time
that they are required to be paid is quite  reasonable.  Simply  put,  those
employers who do  not  pay  their  levies  on  time  are  holding  in  their
possession moneys that the state and the public were supposed to  be  given.
This situation is analogous to a  situation  in  which  the  employers  have
borrowed money from the state and therefore have to  pay  interest  on  that
money that they hold.

In the area of value-added tax, most of the amendments in this area  are  of
a contextual nature as  well  and  seek  to  give  greater  clarity  to  the
intentions of the legislation. In some instances the  amendments  bring  the
provisions of the Act into line with the provisions of the Income  Tax  Act.
The amendments to the VAT Act also bring the  Act  into  line  with  current
technological developments by enabling taxpayers to use  electronic  systems
to file their taxes. This is enhanced by the possibility of the  utilisation
of the electronic signature for tax purposes.

This is a positive development, but could be  abused  by  some  unscrupulous
characters. To prevent any such possibility the Bill introduces offences  to
enable the law to deal with such abuses. Today it is common  knowledge  that
technology-driven systems in any environment bring  about  efficiency.  They
stop the unnecessary loss of time and paper proliferation to the benefit  of
both the service provider and the client. It is  for  this  reason  that  we
will support the Bill.

The Bill also clarifies the issue of which  courts  hold  jurisdiction.  The
amendment to the VAT Act also deals with the issue of  the  jurisdiction  of
courts. It provides clarity on which court  has  the  jurisdiction  when  an
offence is committed under this particular Act. This is necessary to  remove
the  lack  of  certainty  with  regard  to  this  particular  question.  The
amendment provides that the courts with jurisdiction in the  area  in  which
the person who committed the offence resides, or carries out  his  business,
should be qualified to put the offender on trial. This is done with  a  view
to  complementing  the  existing  legislation  and  not  to   limiting   the
jurisdiction provided for in other legislation.

 The good news for taxpayers is also the fact that  the  VAT  Act  is  being
amended with a view to re-introducing VAT exemptions for defined  categories
of transactions. This will in actual  fact  bring  relief  to  a  number  of
taxpayers and also relieve the administration of handling a number of  small
taxes which would not provide any major  benefit  in  the  tax  system.  For
these reasons the ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Mr Chairperson, the Revenue Laws  Amendment  Bill  provides  a
complex set of administrative competency requirements which Sars  will  have
to manage. The cost in effort and time  to  manage  capital  gains  tax  and
residence-based income tax may prove  to  be  an  administrative  nightmare.
South Africa is becoming a heavily tax-based country. The  need  to  balance
taxation versus skills needs to be spelt out in this regard.

Several organisations such as Sacob complained that they had  less  than  10
working days to comment on the Bill, and we would  like  to  appeal  to  the
department to allow for more time in  future.  However,  we  understand  the
need to have this Bill passed before we go into recess.

Most South Africans will pay their taxes and  many,  especially  expatriates
in foreign countries, will make contributions to assist with the  growth  of
South Africa. However, when the taxation policy of  Government  becomes  too
restrictive  on  personal  income  gains,  a  defensive  attitude  prevails.
Foreign-based income has  its  benefits  when  expatriates  return  to  this
country. However, if we persist  with  negative  tax-based  structures,  the
wealth structures of the country could be affected.

Concessions on foreign-earned money are what is  the  best  alternative.  We
need to encourage a greater source of wealth-based  individual  capacity  in
our nation. People must be encouraged to return to  invest  their  resources
and their financial power in  our  country.  South  Africa  is  in  need  of
skills, and those who work overseas  will  come  back  to  reinvest  in  the
growth of this country.

Skills are what South Africa needs most. Government taxation  cannot  supply
the growth in skills as much and as quickly  as  those  who  are  given  the
right set of concessions and incentive benefits to plough  back  into  South
Africa the gains they have acquired overseas.

The Revenue Laws  Amendment  Bill  does  not  fully  ensure  sufficient  tax
flexibility and the ACDP cautions  about  the  negative  impact  of  such  a
strict tax home. However, with these words of caution the ACDP supports  the
amending Bill. [Time expired]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the Revenue Laws  Amendment  Bill  appears  to
bring a number of Acts into line with the  current  structure  of  democracy
and rule of law. It is  very  important  that  each  sphere  inculcates  the
values of the national Constitution at all  levels,  and  that  all  factors
that contribute, influence, enhance and affect such matters are  taken  into
account seriously.

This Bill amends many  laws  and  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  these
amendments are made not only for the improvement of the  revenue  facilities
but also to the betterment of the lives of all South Africans.  At  the  end
of the day, it has to be remembered in everything we  do  that  we  are  the
government of the people by the people and, at all times, we are  answerable
to our people. This is why the values  of  transparency  and  accountability
are so firmly entrenched in our bureaucracy.

We all know the importance  of  national  revenue  in  the  running  of  our
country. In fact, without revenue, would there be much running at all?  Many
other factors contribute to such revenue and it  is  important  to  maintain
good control over these so that such contribution can  be  maintained  at  a
similar, if not better, rate.

Although the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill brings factors into line  with  the
revenue laws for the better management of these issues, it should,  however,
not bar society from activities they previously indulged  in  with  no  real
harm. National revenue is a means to alleviate poverty.  In  doing  so,  the
idea is not to  squeeze  society.  However,  the  MF  is  confident  in  our
Government's proposal. The MF supports  the  Revenue  Laws  Amendment  Bill.
[Applause.]

 Mr C M LOWE: Chairperson, severe time constraints on the  presentations  to
the Portfolio Committee on Finance  during  hearings  on  the  Revenue  Laws
Amendment Bill meant that committee members were often unable to  fully  and
constructively engage the  National  Treasury  and  other  bodies  appearing
before them about the full implications and ramifications  of  the  proposed
legislation.

This curtailment of interaction time is of concern to  the  DA.  We  believe
that in future more opportunity needs to be afforded  to  committee  members
to allow them, and the committee as a whole, to fully  engage  presentations
and presenters and to grapple with the detail  of  proposed  legislation  if
the finance committee is to  become  something  more  than  just  a  lecture
theatre where, with respect, National Treasury simply presents its views.

As my colleague has already  said,  robust  debate  is  required,  with  the
finance committee engaging in more than just  the  technical  detail  around
the perimeter of the real debate. I  repeat,  what  is  required  are  clear
policy debates, a real and in-depth debate around  tax  policy  choices.  At
the moment the committee really tinkers with the technical detail with  very
little input on tax policy itself. This is extremely frustrating to  members
and proposals to address this anomaly are welcomed.

The call for a specialist taxation subcommittee to  deal  specifically  with
tax law is therefore a good one, and we wholeheartedly support it, with  the
presumption, of course, that the Portfolio  Committee  on  Finance  and  its
subcommittees, as and when they are established, will have access  to  their
own  independently  appointed  taxation  and  finance  advisers.   Committee
members are not, by and large, finance and tax experts, nor should they  be,
but they do require the assistance and guidance of experts  as  they  engage
National Treasury, with its own set of advisers, and the other  role-players
in  the  serious  debate  that  must  accompany  the  drafting  of   finance
legislation.

Another concern is that currently  money  Bills  cannot  be  amended,  which
frustrates the political process even further. Even if a party opposes  just
one aspect of a Bill,  it  is  nonetheless  obliged  to  oppose  it  in  its
entirety.

We have already referred  to  the  the  iniquitous  treatment  of  taxpayers
brought about by retroactively implementing fiscal legislation.  Saica  made
the point, which we repeat again today, that retroactivity of laws is a  bad
thing. It is seen as a tool of a totalitarian regime and,  in  the  case  of
tax legislation, it creates uncertainty and impedes confidence.

For the reasons already spelt out, the DP has no choice but  to  reject  the
Bill in its entirety. [Applause.]

Mr K A MOLOTO: Chairperson, the hon Taljaard  has  indicated  very  critical
matters  that  warrant  attention.  It  is  important  to  correct   certain
statements. This House has deliberated extensively  on  the  direction  this
Government should take in developing a tax policy.  This  House  has  agreed
that South Africa should move from source-based taxation to  residence-based
taxation. Globalisation has necessitated such changes. This House  has  also
agreed that in South Africa the rich should pay  proportionately  more  than
the poor.

Therefore South Africans have come to realise the benefits of  an  efficient
and fair tax system. The improvement of our people's lives  depends  on  it.
It is therefore critical that every effort should be  made  to  ensure  that
our tax base is not eroded by various tax avoidance schemes.  The  financing
of old age pensions, child  support  grants,  disability  grants  and  other
measures adopted by this Government to fight poverty depends on a sound  tax
base.

It is important that we should plug loopholes in our  tax  laws  to  protect
the revenue base of South Africa. Each and every South African  is  supposed
to pay transfer duty when acquiring immovable property.  However,  it  needs
to be noted that under the current tax law there  exists  a  possibility  of
avoiding payment of transfer duty through the use of a company or  trust.  A
person holding immovable property through a company can sell that  immovable
property simply by selling the shares  in  that  company  to  an  interested
party. Change of ownership will then be effected through the acquisition  of
the shares. The property will remain registered in  the  name  of  the  same
company and no transfer duty is payable.

Similarly a person holding immovable property through a  trust  can  dispose
of such property simply by substituting beneficiaries. The  substitution  of
beneficiaries effectively  means  that  there  is  a  change  of  ownership.
However,  no  transfer  duty  is  payable  because  the  property  is  still
registered in the name of the same trust. The revenue raised  from  transfer
duty might look insignificant. However, the point I am raising here is  that
it is a matter of principle and of tax morality.

The Revenue Laws Amendment Bill proposes amendments that  will  ensure  that
such tax avoidance measures are stopped. The public officer of  the  company
and the seller of the immovable property in question  will  be  jointly  and
severally liable for the transfer duty. In the case of  a  trust  the  trust
and the trustees will be jointly  and  severally  liable  for  the  transfer
duty. These persons have a right to recover the amounts paid from the  buyer
in the case of the company and from the new beneficiary in the case  of  the
trust.

Our country is making  tremendous  progress  in  dealing  with  our  painful
history of land dispossession. In order to avoid penalising  those  who  are
gaining from the land restitution process, the Bill proposes excluding  this
category of people from capital gains tax. Under the current tax law, in  an
award in terms of the Restitution of Land Rights Act of 1994,  these  people
may be subjected to capital gains tax. A person who has  submitted  a  claim
for land restitution and disposes of that claim in return  for  compensation
may be subjected to capital gains tax. The National  Treasury  needs  to  be
commended for ensuring that  the  victims  of  land  dispossession  are  not
penalised for receiving compensation.

The Bill provides for the establishment of joint land border posts  and  for
the joint administration of such border posts with the  customs  authorities
of the adjoining states. This provision has been necessitated  by  the  SADC
protocol. This aims to strengthen trade  relations  within  the  region  and
ensures that all countries benefit from free trade. The  ANC  supports  this
Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon members, I would like at least  as
much time to reply as hon members had to comment  on  the  Bill.  People  on
this side have called for so many divisions that, because I know  that  they
are  getting  hungry,  I  am  going  to  speak  for  a   long   time   here.
[Interjections.] I must show Dougie! [Interjections.]

Let me comment on a few issues. The first issue  that  members  have  spoken
about is the time allowed for comment on the Bill. The  Bill  was  available
in early draft form on 14 October and then discussed nine days later  on  23
October. That is one day short of the required 10 days,  but  that  required
10 days is convention and there are certain issues that I think  members  of
this House should consider.
Part of the battle is to get out of the clutches of those who, in  my  view,
have tended to capture tax policy  law.  The  law  drafters  is  in  the  SA
Revenue Service and the National Treasury know that I want to take  tax  law
out of this closed club that has had that privileged  access  in  the  past.
Many of those who continue to  appear  before  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Finance on tax matters represent that kind of privilege.

Part of what we need to do is rather to bring the Bill  into  the  portfolio
committee process and have it discussed here, even in its early  form,  than
to take it quietly. Because they have an opportunity for 10 days,  the  same
individuals return before the Portfolio Committee on Finance, restate  their
views and try to hold everybody captive, which I think  is  wrong.  I  think
this plays to the privileged few and part of what we need to be doing is  to
give  Parliament  its  appropriate  place  in  respect   of   dealing   with
legislation.

I would like to believe that we can get support for  that  because  some  of
the individuals concerned who have been part of this very  tight  club  play
different roles. They are all practitioners. There is  one  individual,  for
instance, who now has a very specialised practice in tax arbitrage.  Now  he
has problems, for instance, with the speed of  conflict  resolution  because
it means lower fees for him. Part of what we need to  do  is  to  strengthen
the democratic oversight of Parliament and not have it detoured through  the
same individuals who have held us captive,  and  I  trust  that  even  those
opposing this Bill today will support the intent  of  an  approach  that  is
radically different from where we have been in the past.

 Much has been said about the volume of the Bill and I would  like  to  echo
what the hon Woods said, that notwithstanding the number of clauses and  the
number of pages, if stripped  down,  one  is  dealing  with  three  sets  of
issues. One is dealing with corportary organisation, foreign currency  rules
and individual items.

Sure, there are issues of policy, but I, again, would  hazard  a  debate  on
whether there are policy shifts in the amending  Bill.  These  are,  in  the
main, corrections and some of those corrections, granted,  are  retroactive.
But it is important to understand this in the context of tax  law.  Tax  law
is unique because it is made by practice and by the courts.  Notwithstanding
the piece of legislation that is before this House today, a few  years  down
the track, when people look back on the  issues  that  we  have  dealt  with
here, the bulk of decisions will vest in legal precedent because of the  way
in which the tax courts operate. All that the amendments do in the  main  is
to look back on the intent of the  legislation,  to  understand  that  there
were loopholes and to plug those loopholes.

The other issue about retrospectivity is that in every instance  it  favours
the taxpayers. And so some suggestion that this is autocratic law and  is  a
denial of the rights of taxpayers in this country has  to  be  fundamentally
flawed.  I  challenge  anybody  to  interrupt  me  and  show  me  where  the
retroactivity does not favour the taxpayers. So we  must  be  economical  in
our choice of words and the position we take on these kinds  of  issues.  If
we argue merely for the sake of it, then I think we waste the time  of  this
important and august democratic institution.

A point was also raised about emerging markets. One of the  issues  that  we
need to deal with, which the OECD tax policy research centre is full of,  is
that  emerging  markets  or  developed  economies  face  exactly  the   same
challenges in respect of tax law, partly because one  is  dealing  with  the
same tax  practitioners.  There  are  highly  transnational  companies  they
advise in this kind of  way;  and  they  will  seek  the  loopholes  in  the
emerging market, which they cannot then have in a developed economy.  So  we
need to be alive to these kinds of issues. If we mirror  what  is  happening
in more developed economies it is because that is a broad trend of  tax  law
globally.

Let me also just say that whilst some of these tax practitioners would  take
one view in the committee to try and be radical, the other process is  under
way, and part of it is  the  professionalisation  and  registration  of  tax
practitioners. Announcements will be made within  the  course  of  the  next
fortnight. Work is far down the track.

But we want to know that those who give advice to  the  individual  taxpayer
who pays for that advice, with the best intent, give  the  best  advice  and
that people who  provide  that  advice  must  have  must  some  professional
liability. They  cannot  load  taxpayers  who  find  themselves  in  a  poor
circumstance because of bad advice given by them.

So this is part of the professionalisation and  part  of  the  work  we  are
doing. Some of the individuals who  take  one  position  in  the  committee,
perhaps because of TV cameras and so on, take different  positions  when  we
are dealing with the professionalisation of an industry  that  needs  to  be
structured in the interests of all taxpayers.

This is probably the last time I  will  be  standing  at  the  lectern  here
before Christmas and so  on,  so  let  me  take  this  opportunity  to  wish
everybody well over the festive season. [Applause.]

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Transport on  the  Administrative
     Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Amendment Bill  [B  42D  -  2002]
     (National Assembly - sec 76), dated 12 November 2002:


         The  Portfolio  Committee  on  Transport,  having  considered   the
         Administrative Adjudication  of  Road  Traffic  Offences  Amendment
         Bill [B 42D - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 76),  amended  by  the
         National Council  of  Provinces  and  referred  to  the  Committee,
         reports that it has agreed to the Bill.
     Report to be considered.

2.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on the Regulation of  Interception  of  Communications  and
     Provision of Communication-related Information  Bill  [B  50B  -  2001]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 12 November 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the Regulation of Interception of  Communications
         and Provision of Communication-related Information Bill  [B  50B  -
         2001] (National Assembly - sec 75) and proposed amendments  of  the
         National  Council  of  Provinces   (Announcements,   Tablings   and
         Committee Reports, 1 November, p 1693), referred to the  Committee,
         reports the Bill with amendments [B 50C - 2001].


         The Committee wishes to report further, as follows:


         1. After the Bill  was  passed  by  the  National  Assembly  on  17
              September  2002,  it  has  been  brought  to  the  Committee's
              attention that  the  Bill  does  not  provide  for  compulsory
              "blacklisting" of lost and  stolen  cellular  phones.  When  a
              cellular  phone  (handset)  is  "blacklisted"  by  a  cellular
              telecommunication service provider, the handset is inactive on
              all networks (provided  they  support  blacklisting)  and  the
              handset cannot be used again unless  it  is  delisted  by  the
              cellular telecommunication service provider  concerned  or  by
              other unlawful means.


              From  the  preliminary  views  expressed  by  the   respective
              cellular telecommunication service providers on the  issue  of
              compulsory "blacklisting", it appears to  the  Committee  that
              there is no unanimity amongst them on the matter in  question.
              Whilst some of them support compulsory "blacklisting",  others
              are  more  in  favour  of  compulsory  "greylisting".  When  a
              cellular  phone  (handset)  is  "greylisted"  by  a   cellular
              telecommunication service provider, the handset remains active
              and can be used on all networks, but  the  user  will  receive
              periodic messages to contact  his  or  her  telecommunications
              service provider, since the phone  was  reported  as  lost  or
              stolen.


              Due to a lack of time, the Committee was not in a position  to
              -


              (a) obtain the formal views of the cellular  telecommunication
                  service providers and  law  enforcement  agencies  on  the
                  matter in question; and


              (b) conduct any investigation into the matter in question  and
                  to  consider   the   advantages   and   disadvantages   of
                  "blacklisting" and "greylisting", respectively.


              In the light of the above, the Committee recommends  that  the
              Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional   Development   be
              requested to -


              (i) direct that his Department investigate the above-mentioned
                  matters with a view to  submitting  amending  legislation,
                  if necessary, to Parliament at the  earliest  opportunity;
                  and


              (ii)     submit a progress report on the investigation to  the
                  National Assembly by not later than February 2003.


     Report to be considered.
