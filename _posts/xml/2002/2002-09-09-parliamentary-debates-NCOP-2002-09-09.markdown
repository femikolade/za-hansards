                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat -
       (a)  die onaanvaarbare voortslepende politieke  verleentheid  in  die
           Unistad van Kaapstad onder leiding van mnr Tony Leon  se  DA  'n
           breekpunt bereik het;


       (b)   di√©  onverkwiklike   negatiwiteit   oor   die   leierskap   van
           burgemeester Gerald Morkel besig is om nie net na  die  Wes-Kaap
           nie, maar ook die hele land se DA uit te brei; en


       (c)  mnr Leon se swygsaamheid oor mnr Morkel en  sy  Duitse  skandaal
           besig is om Leon in 'n maalkolk in te trek en te kelder; en


  (2) van  mening  is  dat  mnr  Leon  se  bemarkbaarheid  as  alternatiewe
       regeringsleier vir Suid-Afrika en sy beeld as vegter  teen  korrupsie
       onherstelbaar skade gely het; en


  (3) 'n beroep op mnr Tony Leon doen om te bedank.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the unacceptable ongoing political embarrassment in the  Unicity
           of Cape Town, under the leadership of Mr  Tony  Leon's  DP,  has
           reached breaking point;


       (b)  the unsavoury  negativity  regarding  the  leadership  of  Mayor
           Gerald Morkel is spreading, not only to the  Western  Cape,  but
           also to the DA of the entire country;


       (c)  Mr Leon's silence regarding Mr Morkel and his German scandal  is
           drawing Leon into a whirlpool and sinking him;


  (2) is of the opinion that Mr  Leon's  marketability  as  an  alternative
       Government leader of South Africa and his image as a fighter  against
       corruption has suffered irreparable damage; and


  (3) calls on Mr Tony Leon to resign.]

                     INITIATIVE BY CAPE TOWN MAGISTRATES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)   the  initiative  taken  by  magistrates  from  Cape  Town   who
           sacrificed their free time to work on Saturdays without  getting
           paid; and


       (b)  that through their praiseworthy action, these  magistrates  have
           been able to clear many long-awaited serious  cases  in  regions
           across the Western Cape;


  (2) believes their unselfish action has brought peace of mind to many  of
       the victims and families of victims who have been frustrated  by  the
       long delay in these cases;


  (3) commends all magistrates who participated in this initiative; and


  (4) expresses the hope that their action will  positively  inspire  other
       magistrates throughout the country to follow their example  and  show
       communities that our criminal justice system is  sympathetic  towards
       and responding to their needs.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         FOETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)
Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  today is the ninth of the ninth month and because  the  duration
           of pregnancy is  nine  months,  this  day  was  declared  Foetal
           Alcohol Syndrome Day;


       (b)  the incidence of Foetal Alcohol  Syndrome  in  South  Africa  is
           exceptionally high, in some areas as high as  one  in  every  15
           births;


       (c)  Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is a very serious  health  problem  that
           tragically affects its  victims,  who  often  experience  mental
           health  problems,  disrupted  school  experience  and  behaviour
           problems caused by alcohol and drug abuse; and


       (d)  causing a child to suffer from Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is really
           nothing short of  child  abuse  that  lasts  for  life,  and  is
           completely preventable; and


  (2) requests the Department of Health to do everything possible to  alert
       mothers to be, and to  encourage  them  not  to  use  alcohol  during
       pregnancy - even a small amount of alcohol can be devastating.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

        CONGRATULATIONS ON HOSTING A SUCCESSFUL UNITED NATIONS SUMMIT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the South African  Government  for  its  role  and  the
       support it has provided in  hosting  one  of  the  biggest  and  most
       successful United Nations summits in recent history;


  (2) applauds the efforts of  all  role-players,  including  the  city  of
       Johannesburg and the Johannesburg World Summit  Company,  public  and
       private  institutions,  our  Ministers,  Premiers,  Mayors,   elected
       representatives, national, provincial and local  officials,  security
       forces, volunteers,  business  people,  artists  and  other  creative
       workers, the SABC and other media organisations and most  importantly
       the masses of our people for making this historic event a  resounding
       success; and


  (3) concurs with the sentiments expressed by delegates that this  summit,
       more than any other summit, has succeeded in generating  a  sense  of
       urgency,  commitments  for  action  and   partnerships   to   achieve
       measurable results in our struggle to  reverse  the  high  levels  of
       global poverty and environmental degradation.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN UNITY CONVENTION FOR THE PREVENTION AND COMBATING
                                OF TERRORISM

 (Consideration of Report of Select Committee on Security and Constitutional
                                  Affairs)

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chairperson. It is not by chance  that  South
Africa played a leading role in Nepad. It is not  as  a  favour  that  South
Africa today is chairing the AU. It is because of the valuable  contribution
we are making in South Africa and on  the  continent  that  we  are  in  the
position we are actually in. It is for the very same  reason  that  the  OAU
Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism had to  be  ratified
by us.

The terrorism  issue  is  a  cross-cutting  matter  which  involves  several
departments, especially the SA Police Service,  the  Department  of  Justice
and the Department of Foreign  Affairs  at  a  substantive  level.  The  OAU
convention forms an important part of the regional  framework  in  combating
terrorism and should therefore  be  ratified  expeditiously.This  convention
was signed by South Africa,  as  a  member  state  of  the  Organisation  of
African Unity, now called the AU, after it was adopted on 14 July 1999.

The 1993 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa ends with an  epilogue
entitled ``National Unity and Reconciliation''. It goes on up until today:


  This Constitution provides a historic bridge between the past of a deeply
  divided society characterised by strife, conflict, untold  suffering  and
  injustice, and a future founded  on  the  recognition  of  human  rights,
  democracy and peaceful co-existence and development opportunities for all
  South Africans, irrespective of colour, race, class, belief or sex.

The convention strives to strengthen the  exchange  of  information  between
state parties regarding the following: terrorist  groups,  their  activities
and  arrests;  communication  and  propaganda  methods;  movement  of  their
leaders and their travel documents;  and  studies,  research  and  expertise
relating to control of terrorist acts.

The history of the political offences exclusion in the convention may be  of
interest. The introduction of an exclusion for  political  offences  in  the
convention is a fairly new concept and has been welcomed by  many  countries
as  a  revolutionary  clause  that  gives  real  meaning  to  the  terrorism
convention.

The fact that the political offence clause operates within the framework  of
the convention with a specifically defined offence  has  meant  that  it  is
possible to restrict the exclusion clause to that specific  offence  without
doing away with the general principle of political offences completely.

States like Australia, in giving effect to the political  offence  exclusion
in their domestic legislation, include a clause in  extradition  legislation
specifically excluding the political offence  exception  for  the  specified
acts of the convention, while still retaining the general principle.

One of the clauses to be noted in this convention is to the effect that  the
political offence exclusion clause is balanced in all the conventions  by  a
complementary clause immediately following it, which retains an  element  of
the political offence exclusion principle by allowing the  state  to  refuse
prosecution or extradition if there are substantial  grounds  for  believing
that the person is being prosecuted on discriminatory grounds, eg by  virtue
of that person's race, religion or political opinion. This in turn  supports
the constitutional  epilogue  I  have  mentioned  above.  This  balance  has
enabled many states with  a  strong  foundation  in  the  political  offence
exclusion clause to accept the clause, and on the  whole  it  has  not  been
controversial in negotiations.

This convention  follows  the  unfortunate  incidents  at  the  World  Trade
Centre, the Pentagon and in Pittsburg. The Security Council  of  the  United
Nations adopted a Chapter VII resolution, binding all  member  states.  This
resolution is significant for a number of reasons, including the  fact  that
it reproduced some of the provisions of  the  international  convention  for
the suppression of the financing of terrorism,  thereby  creating  the  same
legal obligations separately from the convention.

Some of the obligations which were placed on member states are  as  follows,
for members  to  note:  the  prevention  and  suppression  of  financing  of
terrorism; the criminalising of the  wilful  provision  of  funds  for  such
acts; the taking of necessary steps to prevent the commission  of  terrorist
acts; the bringing  to  justice  of  those  who  have  participated  in  the
financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of  terrorist  acts  or  in
supporting terrorist acts - the  seriousness  of  such  acts  must  be  duly
reflected in the sentence; the  prevention  of  movement  of  terrorists  or
their groups by effective border  control;  and  that  claims  of  political
motivation shall not be recognised as grounds for refusing the  request  for
the extradition of alleged terrorists. South Africa has supported  also,  in
the Non-Aligned Movement, the combating of terrorism.

Currently, terrorism is addressed by Section 52(1) of the Internal  Security
Act, Act No 74  of  1982.  The  SA  Law  Commission  is  reviewing  security
legislation so as to comply with international standards  as  laid  on  this
convention.

We are not blowing our own trumpet; it is a  fact:  South  Africa  leads  by
example. I have the feeling that members are going to proudly vote for  this
convention. On behalf of my Government, I put  this  convention  before  the
Council for adoption.

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes the debate. I  shall  now  put
the question. The question is that the report be adopted.  As  the  decision
is dealt with in terms of section 65 of  the  Constitution,  I  shall  first
ascertain whether all the delegation heads are present  in  the  Chamber  to
cast their votes. Are all delegation heads present? In accordance with  Rule
71, I shall first allow provinces the opportunity to make their  declaration
of vote, if they so wish.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the question and I  will  do  this  in
alphabetical order per province. We will not be using the electronic  voting
system. Delegation heads must please indicate  to  the  Chair  whether  they
vote in favour or against, or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?

Ms B N DLULANE: Inaudible.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The hon member did not listen. Free State?

Mr T RALANE: We vote in favour.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Gauteng?

Ms J L KGOALI: Gauteng e ya tlatsa. [Gauteng supports that.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: KwaZulu-Natal?

Prince B Z ZULU: Siyaweseka. [We support it.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mpumalanga?

Ms M P THEMBA: Mpumalanga supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Northern Cape?

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Northern Cape supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Northern Province?

An HON MEMBER: We vote in favour.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: North West?

Mr Z S KOLWENI: North West in favour.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Western Cape?

Mr C ACKERMANN: In favour.

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  All  provinces  have  voted  in  favour.  I
therefore declare the question agreed to.

The Council adjourned at 12:15.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional  Affairs
     on the Institution of Legal Proceedings against Organs of State Bill [B
     65B - 99] (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 21 August 2002:


     The Select Committee on Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,  having
     considered the subject of the Institution of Legal Proceedings  against
     Organs of State Bill [B  65B  -  99]  (National  Assembly  -  sec  75),
     referred to it, reports the Bill with proposed amendments, as follows:


     NEW PREAMBLE


     1.     On page 2, after the Long Title, to insert:


     PREAMBLE


         RECOGNISING THAT certain provisions of existing laws provide for-
         *   different  notice  periods  for  the   institution   of   legal
           proceedings against certain organs of state in  respect  of  the
           recovery of a debt;
         *  different prescription periods in respect of such debts;


         AND RECOGNISING THAT-
         *  the Prescription Act, 1969 (Act No  68  of  1969),  consolidated
           and amended the laws relating to prescription and that that  Act
           is the cornerstone of the  laws  regulating  the  extinction  of
           debts by prescription;
         *  some of the  provisions  of  existing  laws  which  provide  for
           different prescription periods in respect of certain  debts  are
           inconsistent with the periods of prescription prescribed by  the
           Prescription Act, 1969;


         AND BEARING IN MIND THAT-
         *  South Africa has moved from a parliamentary sovereign  state  to
           a democratic constitutional sovereign state;
         *  the Bill of Rights is the  cornerstone  of  democracy  in  South
           Africa and that the State must  respect,  protect,  promote  and
           fulfil the rights in the Bill of Rights;
         *  section 34 of the Constitution provides that  everyone  has  the
           right  to  have  any  dispute  that  can  be  resolved  by   the
           application of law decided in a fair  public  hearing  before  a
           court or, where appropriate, another independent  and  impartial
           tribunal or forum;
         *  the right of access to courts may be limited to the extent  that
           the limitation is reasonable and  justifiable  in  an  open  and
           democratic society based on human dignity, equality and  freedom
           as contemplated in section 36 of the Constitution;


         AND RECOGNISING the need to  harmonise  and  create  uniformity  in
         respect of the provisions of existing laws which provide for-
         *   different  notice  periods  for  the   institution   of   legal
           proceedings against certain organs of state for the recovery  of
           a debt, by substituting them with a uniform notice period  which
           will apply in respect of the institution  of  legal  proceedings
           against certain organs of state for the recovery of a debt;
         *  different prescription periods,  by  making  the  provisions  of
           Chapter III of the Prescription Act,  1969,  applicable  to  all
           debts;


         AND RECOGNISING the need to provide for  transitional  arrangements
         to  ensure  a  smooth  transition  between  the  various   existing
         statutory provisions regulating notice periods for the  institution
         of legal proceedings against certain organs of state in respect  of
         the recovery of a debt and the prescription periods of  such  debt,
         and the provisions of this Act;


         AND BEARING IN MIND  the  limited  need,  for  legal  or  practical
         purposes, to retain  certain  provisions  of  existing  laws  which
         provide for-
         *  notice periods that differ from  the  envisaged  uniform  notice
             period;
         *   prescription  periods  that  differ   from   the   periods   of
           prescription prescribed by Chapter III of the Prescription  Act,
           1969,
