   APPRECIATION TO SOUTH AFRICA FOR HOSTING OF WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE
                                 DEVELOPMENT

The President of the Republic, with leave, conveyed the appreciation of  the
international community for the manner in  which  South  Africa  hosted  the
World Summit on Sustainable Development and expressed his gratitude  to  the
people of South Africa.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr N M NENE: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes remarks by the Minister of Finance,  Trevor  Manuel,  that  the
       interest rate hikes are a blunt and probably ineffective response  to
       price rises, particularly with regard to food;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the major causes of inflationary pressures in the South  African
           economy at present are external shocks, namely pressures on  the
           rand in global currency markets and rising oil prices; and


       (b)  the interest rate increases do not  address  these  causes,  are
           punitive  towards  many  ordinary  consumers  and  may  have   a
           detrimental impact on growth;


  (3) further believes that there is an urgent need to address the issue of
       the impact of the rise in food prices, particularly on the poor;


  (4) welcomes the call for a wider  debate  on  the  development  of  more
       effective tools to deal with rising prices; and


  (5) further welcomes the Government's commitment to deal with the  impact
       of the food price rises on the poor.

[Applause.]

Mr R J HEINE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the hon the Minister of Communications  yesterday  assured
       the House that Telkom does not make donations to  political  parties,
       and that the donation of R57  760  given  to  the  ANC  was  in  fact
       intended for the Whippery of Parliament; and


  (2) therefore calls upon the ANC to  refund  the  amount  to  Telkom  and
       apologise to Telkom for misleading them as  to  the  purpose  of  the
       money, and to apologise to this House  for  misusing  Parliament  for
       fundraising purposes.

[Applause.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with joy that a three-month-old baby girl was reunited with her
       mother after she disappeared in  the  early  hours  of  Saturday,  14
       September this year, from their room in Khayelitsha  in  the  Western
       Cape;


  (2) further notes that child  abuse  and  abduction  have  become  common
       occurrences in South Africa;


  (3) appreciates that the child was found by a Good Samaritan  on  the  N2
       roadside and taken to the Masigcine Children's Home in Mfuleni;


  (4) urges residents of all communities to follow the good example of  the
       residents of Driftsands; and


  (5) hopes that the police will  make  every  effort  to  investigate  the
       incident thoroughly.

Mr L CHIBA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move on  behalf
of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -
       (a)  that Iraq has agreed to  unconditionally  allow  United  Nations
           weapons inspectors back into that country; and


       (b)  that despite this announcement, the United States administration
           continues to display an aggressive stance and continues with its
           planning for a military onslaught against the people of Iraq;


  (2) further notes that former President Nelson Mandela  has  accused  the
       United  States  of  wanting  to  bully  world   leaders   by   acting
       unilaterally against Iraq;


  (3) believes that -


       (a)  unilateral action by the United States against Iraq will lead to
           further tensions and a possible rise in terrorist actions; and


       (b)   international  tensions  and  conflicts   must   be   addressed
           multilaterally and under the aegis of the United Nations;


  (4) welcomes the announcement by Iraq allowing United Nations  inspectors
       into that country unconditionally; and


  (5) reiterates its call that the United States desist from its plans  for
       the military invasion of Iraq.

[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  the  request  by  the  DP  to  meet  with  the  Minister   of
       Intelligence, Lindiwe Sisulu;


  (2) calls on the DP during that meeting to -


       (a)  shed light on its own propaganda tricks,  through  which  it  is
           carrying out its questionable  activities  to  promote  its  own
           cause;


       (b)  explain the function of Mr  Ryan  Coetzee  as  DP  spin  doctor,
           whilst at the same time receiving state remuneration; and


       (c)  explain the role and activities of former security  apparatchik,
           Mr Russel Crystal, who is now employed by  the  DP  and  working
           specifically for the hon Mr Leon; and


  (3) further notes that -


       (a)  the DP has at last been shocked into the reality that  they  are
           also exposed to crime like the rest of the country, but  somehow
           expect preferential treatment, which is not available to the man
           in the street; and


       (b)  conspiracy theories and paranoia are classic  elements  of  far-
           right groupings.

[Applause.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I  shall  move
on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns without reservation the occurrence of another shooting in  a
       court building, this time in an East London magistrates' court;


  (2) notes that the shooter was appearing in court for the  verdict  in  a
       case where he had been accused of  attempted  murder,  and  that  the
       shooter wounded his accuser, killed a friend of the accuser, and then
       killed himself;


  (3) expresses its disgust at the continued failure by the  Department  of
       Justice and Constitutional Development to provide  adequate  security
       at court buildings, and  specifically  at  the  fact  that  a  person
       accused of a serious violent crime managed to bring a gun into court;
       and


  (4) calls upon the Minister for Justice and  Constitutional  Development,
       as well as the Minister of Safety and Security, to  urgently  address
       the issue of court security, recognising  that  this  trend  must  be
       nipped in the bud before it becomes commonplace  and  undermines  the
       whole concept of justice.

Ms L MABE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move  on  behalf
of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Minister of Finance, Trevor Manuel, and his delegation  will
           attend the annual general meetings of the  World  Bank  and  the
           International  Monetary  Fund  in  Washington  from  27  to   29
           September 2002;
       (b)   these  institutions  are  reviewing  their  current  role   and
           repositioning  themselves  to  play  a  positive  role  in   the
           sustainable development of all the countries of the world; and


       (c)  the hon Trevor Manuel  will  advance  the  agenda  for  Africa's
           development and that of all developing countries in his capacity
           as a chairperson of the IMF and  the  World  Bank's  Development
           Committee;


  (2) believes that this reflects the commitment of the ANC-led  Government
       to fight poverty and work for  economic  prosperity  on  the  African
       continent; and


  (3) wishes the Minister of Finance, Trevor  Manuel,  and  his  delegation
       every success in their mission.

[Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I  shall  move  on
behalf of the MF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  recent statistics have displayed  a  horrific  rate  of  persons
           affected by asbestosis;


       (b)  the media has brought to the public eye  a  number  of  asbestos
           grounds that are affecting residents; and


       (c)  many deaths have been reported as  a  result  of  this  and  the
           number of deaths continues to escalate;


  (2) calls for an end to the delay and for immediate action to  be  taken;
       and


  (3) notes that we are here to protect our people and not to kill them.
Mnr C AUCAMP: Mev die Speaker, namens die AEB gaan ek voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) sy afkeur uitspreek oor die wyse waarop mnr Mugabe die regsproses  in
       Zimbabwe  omgeskep  het   in   'n   instrument   van   gelegitimeerde
       staatsterreur, wat duidelik blyk uit die -


       (a)   arrestasie  van  regter  Fergus  Blackie   op   'n   klag   van
           regsverydeling oor 'n uitspraak wat hy as regter gemaak het;


       (b)  lang vonnis van mnr Phillip Pretorius op 'n klag van moord nadat
           hy, terwyl hy weggejaag het van  dreigende  plaasbesetters,  een
           raakgery het; en


       (c)  feit dat nog nie een persoon aangekla is oor  die  moord  op  13
           boere en 31 plaaswerkers in Zimbabwe die afgelope twee jaar nie;




  (2) kennis neem van wat  mnr  Wilfred  Mhanda,  leier  van  die  Zimbabwe
       Liberation  Platform  -  self  'n  ware   Zanu-PF-oorlogsveteraan   -
       gisteraand op die TV-program Third Degree gesê het, naamlik:


         ... silent diplomacy with Mugabe is  perceived  by  Zimbabweans  as
         silent support; and that the only thing they ask from South  Africa
         and other countries is to say openly:  What  Mugabe  is  doing,  is
         wrong ...;


  (3) 'n beroep op president Mbeki doen om presies dit  te  doen,  soos  hy
       vandag so duidelik gedoen het toe hy oor steniging in Nigerië gepraat
       het.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -
  (1) expresses its  condemnation  of  the  way  in  which  Mr  Mugabe  has
       transformed the justice system in  Zimbabwe  into  an  instrument  of
       legitimised state terror, which is evident from the -


       (a)  arrest of Justice Fergus Blackie on a charge  of  defeating  the
           ends of justice regarding a judgment handed down by him  in  his
           capacity as a judge;


       (b)  lengthy prison sentence of Mr Phillip Pretorius on a  charge  of
           murder after he,  while  speeding  away  from  threatening  farm
           occupiers, knocked one of them down; and


       (c)  fact that not one person has yet been charged with the murder of
           13 farmers and 31 farmworkers in Zimbabwe in the past two years;


  (2) notes what Mr Wilfred Mhanda, the leader of the  Zimbabwe  Liberation
       Platform - himself a true Zanu-PF  war  veteran  -  said  on  the  TV
       Programme 3rd Degree last night, namely, that:


         ... silent diplomacy with Mugabe is  perceived  by  Zimbabweans  as
         silent support; and the only thing they ask from South  Africa  and
         other countries is to say openly: What Mugabe is  doing,  is  wrong
         ...; and


  (3) calls upon President Mbeki to do just that, as he has done so clearly
       today in respect of stoning in Nigeria.]

Ms N MAHLAWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that  Langa,  the  first  township  in  the  Western  Cape,  is
       celebrating its 75th anniversary from 15 to 24 September 2002;


  (2) further notes that -
       (a)  Chief Langalibalele the 2nd, the Minister  of  Finance  the  hon
           Trevor Manuel and a representative from Old Mutual lit the torch
           marking the 75th anniversary; and


       (b)  Minister Ronnie Kasrils and Paul Coleman planted trees in honour
           of Chief  Langalibalele  the  1st,  Innie  Silinga  and  Johnson
           Ngwevela; and


  (3) commends the Langa Development Trust for organising this event as  it
       forms part of celebrating the  common  heritage  of  our  people  and
       contributes to our common destiny as a nation united in diversity.

[Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -
       (a)  inflation has risen above 10, while  food  price  inflation  has
           risen above 17%;


       (b)   the  unemployed  and  lower  income  earners  are  facing  real
           hardship, with malnutrition rising amongst children; and


       (c)  four interest rate hikes in one year have put people's homes  at
           risk as they struggle to meet bond repayments;


  (2) expresses its distress at the disastrous impact of spiralling  prices
       on families; and


  (3) calls on the Government to consider  introducing  the  DA's  proposed
       basic income grant to at least help the poorest of the poor.

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on
behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Mooi River Textiles in KwaZulu-Natal posted  a  profit  in
       its first four years;


  (2) further notes that a  groundbreaking  agreement  between  labour  and
       management in this factory earlier this year led to the  preservation
       of jobs in the textile factory;


  (3) also notes that the average production rate in the factory, since the
       agreement was entered into, has reached 25%; and


  (4) encourages Mooi River Textiles' management  and  labour  to  continue
       with their commitment to the  preservation  of  jobs  and  the  local
       economy through their hard work and successful implementation of this
       agreement.

Ms N L HLANGWANA: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the refurbished Mafikeng Prison was recently opened  after
       it had been closed down five years ago  because  of  its  dilapidated
       state;


  (2) acknowledges that the prison will assist in reducing  the  burden  of
       overcrowding in our prisons;


  (3)  further  acknowledges  that  prison  labour  was  utilised  in   the
       refurbishment   of   Mafikeng   Prison,   thereby   entrenching   the
       rehabilitation goals of the Department of  Correctional  Services  by
       giving 54 prisoners on-the-job training in  bricklaying,  plastering,
       welding, carpentry, painting, tiling and plumbing; and


  (4) believes that -


       (a)  the reopening  of  this  prison  has  led  to  the  creation  of
           employment opportunities for the people of  Mafikeng  and  those
           living in the surrounding areas; and
       (b)  this reflects the determination of the ANC ...

[Time expired.]

Mev M E OLCKERS: Mevrou die Speaker, hiermee gee ek  kennis  dat  ek  namens
die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)   die  Departement  van  Onderwys,  in   samewerking   met   nie-
           regeringsorganisasies, binnekort met 'n effektiewe kindergerigte
           MIV-bewusmakingsveldtog sal begin;


       (b)  Suid-Afrikaanse kinders  nou  op  een  van  hul  gunsteling  TV-
           programme, Takalani Sesame, kennis sal  maak  met  die  handpop,
           Kami, wat MIV-positief is;


       (c)  dié program, wat kinders tussen sewe en agt jaar teiken, ook oor
           die radio uitgesaai sal word, wat  beteken  dat  kinders  sonder
           toegang   tot   elektrisiteit   of   TV-stelle   ook   by    die
           bewusmakingsveldtog sal baatvind; en


       (d)  daar erkenning gegee word aan jong slagoffers van  MIV/Vigs  wat
           met die siekte saamleef en dikwels verwerping ervaar; en


  (2) glo dat hierdie veldtog 'n groot bydrae sal lewer om jong kinders  se
       onkunde oor MIV/Vigs uit die weg te ruim.

[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs M E OLCKERS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)   the  Department  of  Education,  in  collaboration  with   non-
           governmental organisations, will commence  in  the  near  future
           with an effective HIV-awareness campaign aimed at children;


       (b)  South African children will now, on one of  their  favourite  TV
           programmes, Takalani Sesame, make the acquaintance of  the  hand
           puppet Kami, who is HIV positive;


       (c)  this programme, which is aimed at children between the  ages  of
           seven and eight, will also be  broadcast  on  the  radio,  which
           means that children who do not have access to electricity or  TV
           sets will also be able to benefit from this awareness  campaign;
           and


       (d)  recognition is given to young victims of HIV/Aids who are living
           with this disease and frequently experience rejection; and


  (2) believes that this campaign will make a great  contribution   towards
       eliminating young children's ignorance regarding HIV/Aids.

[Applause.]]

                                HERITAGE DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  move
without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that South Africans will be  celebrating  Heritage  Day  on  24
       September 2002 with the theme "Celebrating our national  symbols  and
       national institutions";


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the celebration of Heritage Day is the celebration of a  society
           that is arising out of the struggles  of  our  painful  past  to
           become a new nation, united in diversity; and


       (b)  through these celebrations, the Government and people  of  South
           Africa  are  working  together  to  build  a  nation  united  in
           diversity; and


  (3) calls on South Africans from all walks of  life  to  work  towards  a
       prosperous nation and the unity of all people for a brighter future.

Agreed to.

                      QUESTIONS TO THE DEPUTY PRESIDENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the
draft resolution printed on the Order Paper in the name of  the  Chief  Whip
of the Majority Party, as follows.


  That, notwithstanding Rule 110(1)(b), Questions to the  Deputy  President
  will be taken on 25 September 2002,  although  the  Deputy  President  is
  scheduled to reply to questions in the National Council of  Provinces  in
  the same week.

Agreed to.

                        EDUCATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Takalani Sesame was, of course, sponsored by  the
national Department of Education.

Madam Speaker and hon members, I have pleasure in introducing the  Education
Laws Amendment Bill, which seeks to effect amendments to five  other  pieces
of legislation. Some of  the  changes  are  minor,  such  as  the  technical
amendment  to  the  General  and  Further  Education  and  Training  Quality
Assurance Act. I do not intend to deal with these. However, I would like  to
make a preliminary statement.

My  experience  with  the  manner  in  which  the  Bill  was  commented  on,
especially during the committee stage, raised some concern and distress.  As
public representatives who are  charged  with  the  responsibility  to  pass
laws, we need to demonstrate a  higher  level  of  understanding  about  the
legislative process if we are to assist the public to  understand  the  laws
we make and  the  decisions  we  take  on  their  behalf.  If  we  ourselves
demonstrate ignorance of the  draft  laws,  or  we  ignore  their  existence
simply for the sake of gain,  then  we  should  not  expect  the  public  to
respect what we do and to take the laws we make seriously. Therefore,  as  I
open this debate, I feel obliged to request that we all at  least  agree  on
the basics and fundamentals, even if we may disagree and differ in  emphasis
and approach.
I would like to outline some of  these  basics,  and  demonstrate  how  they
apply to the Bill. Firstly, we  must  all  agree  that  a  major  change  in
legislation is necessitated by a number of factors,  one  of  which  is  the
direction given by our courts through its judgments. I am singling out  this
particular factor of court judgments because I want to believe that  we  all
agree that, fundamental to our constitutional order,  is  the  principle  of
the independence of the courts,  respect  for  their  judgments,  especially
that of the highest court in the land, the  Constitutional  Court,  and  the
need to respect these judgments.

If the court's judgment  implies  that  something  that  is  being  done  is
unlawful, either because the law is in conflict  with  the  Constitution  or
because the mechanisms that are being employed do not have a basis  in  law,
then the Government is obliged to correct this. I do not think  anyone  here
differs on what I am saying. If we  all  understand  this,  then  they  will
understand why we needed to legislate on the age of admission, as we  do  in
this Bill.

This need arises from the Constitutional Court judgment in the Harris  case,
which supported the judgment  of  the  High  Court  which  argued  that  the
statement of policy could only be binding on parties it  was  intended  that
it should be binding on, provided that it was expressed in  legislation.  An
admission policy already existed prior to the judgment,  and  its  existence
was therefore not in question.

The issue  was  whether,  in  applying  such  a  policy,  we  would  not  be
discriminating against a specific child, therefore not placing  the  child's
interests first. Unfortunately, the Constitutional Court did not  deal  with
this fundamental issue and, therefore, we still  do  not  have  the  court's
view on whether any admission policy that prescribes  an  age  of  entry  is
discriminatory.

Our view is that we need such  a  policy  in  order  to  ensure  equity  and
fairness, and this view still stands. However,  since  the  court  suggested
that unless this was expressed in legislation, it would not  be  binding  on
third parties, and it was not clear whether it would even be binding on  the
provinces. So, we had to clarify the position.

I thought I should dwell on this a little bit, because it underpins two  key
amendments which this  Bill  introduces  -  the  admission  policy  and  the
curriculum policy. Regarding the admission policy, we are seeking to do  two
things. Firstly, we are seeking to do what the  court  suggested  we  should
do, namely to ensure that  national  policy  is  expressed  in  and  through
legislation. In the case of education, hundreds of  policy  directives  have
been promulgated as policy in the last five or six years. Now we  will  have
to use regulations.

Secondly, we are also amending existing  policy,  providing  that,  as  from
2004, children may be admitted to Grade 1 on condition that they  will  turn
six by 30 June, a six-month reduction in the present position. In  addition,
we have allowed for extraordinary circumstances, but these  are  limited  to
ensure that they are effected in a fair and equitable manner.

With regard to the curriculum again, the country  has  a  curriculum  policy
which  is  at  present  being  followed  in  all  the   schools,   including
independent schools. The determination of a national curriculum for  general
and further education and its application to  both  public  and  independent
schools is necessary and reasonable. I do not know of  any  country  in  the
world with a unitary system such as ours which does not require all  schools
to follow a national curriculum. We must do  so  in  pursuit  of  our  goal,
especially after the freedom of nation-building. We all know that  even  the
right to  private  education  is  subject  to  some  limitations,  including
adherence to the Constitution and, especially, that no education in  private
structures should be lower than that provided in public education.

So, far from ``dumbing down'', to use the inelegant  phrase  coined  by  the
Financial Mail, we are trying to lift the standards in all our schools.  The
curriculum is  a  centrepiece  of  education  provision.  We  are  therefore
obliged to set minimum standards in order to  achieve  and  arrive  at  some
judgment of how independent schools compare with public education.  We  will
not be legislating for a curriculum, as other countries, such as the  United
Kingdom, France, or Ireland - a country I  know  very  well  -  do.  We  are
issuing a curriculum statement.  We  have  emphasised  that  the  curriculum
statement comprises minimum outcomes and standards, and we are therefore  in
no way prescribing to schools or teachers what they should do and how.  This
is the essence of outcomes-based education.

As professionals, teachers must develop the learning programmes  which  will
achieve the prescribed outcomes. Independent  schools  can  therefore,  like
all schools, explore every possible way to achieve the minimum outcomes  and
standards we are prescribing, or even exceed them.

I have spent some time explaining this, because I have been concerned  about
the manner in which some people - not those who are professionally  involved
in this - have distorted this particular area.  These two  amendments  arise
from the proper and normal process of legislation,  and  are  not  based  on
anything other than giving legislative expression  to  an  already  existing
situation.

The same applies to the aspect of assessment  of  learner  achievement.  Our
wish is to have a national framework for assessment, which will allow us  to
publish a national set of results, confident in  the  knowledge  that  these
are based on common processes and standards. This is not intended to  stifle
innovation, where it exists, although I am excited to  learn  that  some  of
these people  who  speak  about  innovation  actually  represent  innovation
rather than the dull hand of tradition and obsequiousness.

We do not want to abolish innovation in relation to  assessment  procedures.
There is no threat to the future of legitimate assessment  bodies  who  have
worked with  us  to  support  and  develop  the  assessment  of  a  national
curriculum. At the same time, we  cannot  allow  the  existence  of  foreign
bodies which offer pupils a qualification based on a foreign  syllabus  with
a dubious value in the marketplace.

I now wish to address the amendments dealing with a  process  that  is  very
important - the employment of teachers. I  am  aware  that  there  has  been
considerable  confusion  in  this  regard  and  we  must,  in  fact,  assert
confidence in our  young  people  so  that  they  know  there  is  something
predictable about their futures.

Let me try to explain. The process  for  the  appointment  of  new  teachers
undoubtedly needs  review.  Currently,  we  have  a  cumbersome  process  of
appointment, which is not in the interests of  either  the  schools  or  the
applicants. Anyone who knows anything on the ground will know that  it  does
not serve the interests of young people. Many schools, especially  those  in
rural areas and townships, fail to  attract  suitably  qualified  candidates
for  advertised  posts,  leaving  them  with  large  numbers   of   unfilled
vacancies. Presently, the only way they can fill  these  posts  is  if  they
receive applications from prospective  candidates.  Surely,  we  will  never
ensure that these schools receive candidates of quality if we use  only  one
method of recruitment?
Many members of the House argue that we must create  incentives  for  people
to teach in rural areas. Let me explain, therefore, that  we  are  beginning
to negotiate with the teacher unions. It will  take  a  very  long  time  to
negotiate, and there is no guarantee that an entirely voluntary system  will
work.

The present method of recruitment, if it continues to be the only way,  will
not only be a disincentive, but also an obstacle. This needs  to  be  looked
at from the side of the prospective employee also. Students coming  straight
from higher education institutions, whether they are  white  or  black,  are
required to complete numerous application forms, and send  them  to  schools
which they know nothing about. This procedure does not  favour  any  of  the
parties concerned, and prevents the rapid appointment of  teachers  that  is
required in the face of possible  teacher  shortages.  It  also  discourages
young entrants from entering the profession,  as  it  creates  a  perception
that finding employment as a teacher is a difficult and cumbersome process.
We also have serious problems  of  racial  representivity  in  school  staff
rooms which, we are all agreed, must be  addressed.  Governing  bodies  have
failed to use their powers to promote the necessary  speed  and  changes  in
this regard. The amendments which have been introduced seek to  address  all
these problems without  deviating  from  the  principle  of  governing  body
participation in the appointment of educators.

The provisions do not get rid of the processes, let  me  assure  the  House.
Outlined in the relevant section of the South African  Schools  Act  is  the
process of the recruitment and appointment of teachers. Those  who  wish  to
use the existing procedures are free to do so, and where  the  province  has
identified applicants who match the  post,  then  consultation  between  the
governing body and the province is made possible by this  amendment.  First-
time applicants are also free to apply directly to schools.

Where these process are seen to be effective, they  can  continue,  provided
they are not used to exclude people on the grounds of race. After  eight  or
nine years of freedom, we cannot allow anyone to be excluded on the  grounds
of race. We must allow, therefore, an  alternative  route  for  schools  and
applicants who are not well-served in this process.

The new draft provides  for  one  application  to  the  relevant  provincial
department of education, which will then match applicants to  vacancies  and
make offers to suitably qualified applicants. Anyone offered a job  on  this
basis is free to turn down the posting. Only in  cases  where  the  province
has invested bursary money - and we are encouraging the provinces  to  raise
the bursary moneys in the training of teachers - will there be a  limitation
on the powers of governing bodies.

In these cases, which are very rare, the nine  provincial  departments  will
be required - not I in Pretoria - to identify the post to  which  they  wish
to appoint the trained person, and to consult with  the  governing  body  in
regard to the requirements prior to making the appointment. This  will  only
apply, as I said, to a limited category of teachers, and should not be  seen
as a threat to the functions of a school governing body. A  province  cannot
spend public money on training teachers and then  find  that  they  are  not
being  appointed,  especially  in  mathematics,   science   and   indigenous
languages, by governing bodies in schools where they  are  most  needed,  as
determined by the province.

I am confident these provisions will  bring  about  greater  efficiency  and
fairness in the system. The state as an employer has a stake  in  protecting
its interests in the  employment  processes,  including  ensuring  that  the
rights of prospective employees are protected, as  required  by  all  labour
legislation.

The development of  performance  standards  for  teachers  is  an  important
matter that arises from the incapacity code which this  House  approved  two
years ago. At that time, I was keen to prescribe the standards  as  to  what
happens when a teacher is incapable of performing his or  her  functions.  I
was persuaded that these should be collectively negotiated with the  unions.
I agreed to allow 12 months for this to  happen,  after  which  I  indicated
that I would return to Parliament if no agreement was reached. I  regret  to
say that, two years later, there is still no  agreement.  I  now  intend  to
determine these regulations. We cannot allow a situation where teachers  who
are incapable of doing their jobs are allowed to continue teaching.  I  hope
and understand the House will agree with this.

The banning of initiation ceremonies must be separated  from  the  provision
of positive orientation programmes by institutions. We  have  defined  these
very carefully. No one in this House will accept  the  idea  that  practices
which strip our children of their dignity and humanity can continue  in  the
name of tradition.

Finally - here is the promotive function of Government  -  the  registration
of private providers of higher education and training, which is  a  scandal,
is  urgently  needed.  We  have  done  this  for  private  higher  education
providers. Now we see, in the  dramatic  increase  that  we  have  found  in
further education and training, that we  have  a  responsibility  to  ensure
minimum standards to stop the fly-by-nighters and  to  protect  gullible  or
desperate students.

I have been accused of many things, including stripping governing bodies  of
their powers. I have no  intention  of  doing  that.  We  have  set  up  the
commission of inquiry to ensure that governing bodies will perform the  work
for which they were originally set up. They will be  stronger,  have  better
training  and  will,  therefore,  meet  the  expectations  of  the  original
founders of governing bodies, which is a central programme of the  ANC,  and
Blade Nzimande here fought very hard to ensure that we have them.

I commend this legislation to the House. [Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, this Bill  sets  out
to amend five  education  Acts  to  enable  the  Minister  of  Education  to
regulate, inter alia, the following policy areas for public and  independent
schools, namely a  national  curriculum  statement;  the  appointment  of  a
certain category of teachers; a national process for assessment,  monitoring
and evaluation for  quality  education;  initiation  practices  in  schools;
norms and minimum standards for school funding; and the admission age  of  a
learner to public and independent  schools.  Moreover,  the  Bill  seeks  to
increase the Minister's power to regulate with the force of  legislation  on
``any matter which may be necessary or expedient to prescribe  in  order  to
achieve the object of this Act''.

The  DA  is  concerned  about  the  Government's  propensity  to   rule   by
regulation. There is a danger that the substance of laws can  be  placed  in
regulations determined  by  ministerial  discretion,  and  not  through  the
parliamentary process. As a general principle, regulations are  not  subject
to the same procedural scrutiny as laws. They are  malleable  by  people  in
power and therefore less transparent.

Regulations should contain only operational details. They should not  change
policy or set principles that  have  not  been  the  subject  of  democratic
debate.  The  regulations  clause  certainly  goes  beyond  operational  and
technical details. We want to express our concern in this regard.

The effective lowering of the age of admission  by  six  months  will  bring
South Africa more in  line  with  international  practices.  Yet,  there  is
little indication that account has been taken of current population  trends,
enrolment patterns and availability of Grade R facilities. The  lowering  of
the age of admission, we  submit,  while  being  essentially  a  progressive
step,  could  have  serious  enrolment  consequences  for  schools   serving
communities with limited preprimary facilities.  This  challenge  will  also
have significant implications for human resources and physical facilities.

I would like to make a few comments about the  implications  of  ministerial
discretion with regard to a national curriculum statement. I  agree  largely
with what the Minister has said  and,  in  this  regard,  I  would  like  to
mention that the proposed amendment to the Bill reflecting a  movement  away
from the  concept  of  prescribing  a  national  curriculum  to  a  national
curriculum statement  applicable  to  public  and  independent  schools,  as
agreed to by most parties, is very  welcome.  A  fully  prescribed  national
curriculum for both independent  and  public  schools  would  have  had  the
impact of creating a homogeneous educational environment and,  at  the  same
time, would have lead to the demise of centres of good practice,  excellence
and, above all, the innovation that currently exists.

We believe that  in  line  with  the  notion  of  comparable  standards,  as
indicated in the Constitution and the South African Schools Act, a  national
curriculum statement  reflects  the  assertion  in  the  revised  curriculum
statement for Grade R to Grade 9, which  we  interpret  to  mean  that  each
school will be free to decide on the content and appropriate  method  to  be
used in working towards the achievement of the concepts, skills  and  values
embedded in  learning  outcomes.  The  constitutional  requirement  is  that
independent schools should maintain  standards  that  are  not  inferior  to
standards at comparable public institutions. This will be in line  with  the
Minister's own statement in a letter to the Financial Mail of 5  July  2002,
and I quote:


  Under the outcomes-based  curriculum,  only  the  outcome  standards  are
  prescribed, while the content and method by which  the  learners  achieve
  these are determined by the professional in charge.

Hence, the provision in the Bill in this regard certainly makes  sense.  The
DA regards the human rights and dignity of all children as  fundamental  and
as non-negotiable principles.  Therefore,  we  welcome  the  prohibition  of
corporal punishment and initiation practices. We view  initiation  practices
as abusive, primitive and unconstitutional.

The proposed changes to  the  Employment  of  Educators  Act  are  of  major
concern to us, because these changes will remove the right of selection  and
recommendation from the school governing  bodies.  Instead,  the  provincial
education  departments  will  have  the  right  to  match  applications   to
vacancies.

The DA understands the problems of teacher shortages, especially in  certain
critical  subjects  like  mathematics,  science  and  accounting,  and,   in
particular, in historically disadvantaged communities. We definitely have  a
problem there. We appreciate that a two-pronged or multipronged strategy  is
needed to sort out these problems, but in a democratic,  open  society  like
ours, the end does not necessarily justify the means.

To contextualise our principled opposition to the limitation of  the  powers
of SGBs, we need to reflect on the foundational rationale of the new  system
of education ushered in by the South African Schools Act - Sasa  -  and,  in
tandem with it, the Employment of Educators  Act  of  1998  as  amended.  In
doing so, we question  the  intention  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  and
enquire now after the motives of the Government regarding the governance  of
public schools, the  role  of  parents  and  other  stakeholders  and,  more
particularly, the SGBs.

The Education White Paper No 2 of 1996  contains  the  Ministry's  proposals
regarding the basis of a new system of education. The Ministry espoused  the
principle of ownership of a school by the community it serves; of a  genuine
partnership between  a  local  community  and  a  provincial  department  of
education; and of limiting the role of provincial education  departments  in
school governance to the minimum required for legal accountability.

The role of the SGBs in the appointment of educators to vacant public  posts
was thus stated clearly in paragraph 3, on page 28 of  the  White  Paper.  I
shall now quote extensively from the White Paper as follows:


  ... appointments  will  be  made  by  departments  of  education  on  the
  recommendation of and in consultation with school governing bodies.  This
  balances the prerogative of  governing  bodies  with  the  necessity  for
  government decision, while providing strong safeguards against  arbitrary
  administrative action. The Ministry of  Education  appreciates  that  the
  responsibility  of  making  teaching  staff  appointments  would  be  the
  clearest indication of the extent to which real devolution  of  decision-
  making power to the school level  has  taken  place.  All  public  school
  governing bodies ...

And here comes the central statement -


  ... would have the authority to recommend the appointment of teachers  to
  their respective provincial education departments.

The DA welcomes the letter and the spirit of the Ministry's position on  the
role and functions of SGBs as cited above. We  say  ``Hallelujah''.  I  have
quoted extensively not from a DA document, nor  from  a  document  from  the
Association of School Governing Bodies,  but  from  the  department's  White
Paper No 2 of 1996. Now the Ministry and the ruling party want to move  away
from their own foundation document regarding procedures to be followed  when
appointing teachers.

During the public hearings all but one stakeholder strenuously opposed  this
clause. Similarly, the opposition parties opposed  this  clause  during  our
deliberations at the portfolio committee meetings. The ruling party  refused
to take on board our recommendations to bring the SGBs into the picture,  as
indicated in the foundation document. The pertinent  question  then  arises:
What  is  the  practical  value  of  legislation  if  the  stakeholders   of
legislation are against it?

The DA believes that this clause erodes one of the most important rights  of
the school governing bodies - the  right  to  recommend  to  the  department
educators who would teach their children. This right is the  basis  of  what
is virtually a covenant between the state and school communities, in  return
for  which  governing  bodies  have  been   prepared   to   accept   massive
responsibilities for the governance and financing of their schools.

Furthermore, this amendment retains the potential to give  rise  to  endless
disputes from both governing bodies and unions  concerning  the  filling  of
posts. In addition, the process which is being suggested  gives  rise  to  a
number of practical and  managerial  difficulties,  which  could  result  in
lengthy delays in the filling of posts.

The DA, for the above reason, opposes this Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Madam Speaker,  can
we assume then in this House that the speech of the hon Ntuli, who has  just
left the podium, will not be recorded in Hansard, as this is the  speech  of
the DA and not the DP? [Interjections.] We do not have such a party in  this
House.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! That is true, hon member. We do not have  the  DA
in this House and, in fact, the matter has been raised previously.  However,
we do understand that the hon members are referring to the DP plus  the  hon
member from the FA. It would actually help if we  could  be  accurate  about
who is in this House.

Prof S M MAYATULA: Madam Speaker,  hon  members,  the  Bill  before  us  has
evoked such controversy that I would like to start off by clearing up a  few
issues.

Some people have alleged that they  were  not  given  enough  time  to  make
presentations before the committee. To put  the  record  straight,  I  would
like to  report  as  follows.  On  21  July,  the  portfolio  committee  put
advertisements in the Sunday Times, the City  Press  and  Rapport,  inviting
comments from the public, with a  reply  date  of  31  July.  The  Bill  was
certified at that stage. Any person requesting a copy of  the  Bill  through
the Department of Education, as indicated in the Gazette of  26  June  2002,
was given a copy of the certified version of the Bill.

On 13 August public hearings were conducted.  About  18  organisations  sent
their written submissions; of these, 15 accepted our  invitation  to  appear
before the committee, but only 14 made their oral presentations.  What  more
could one expect? This Bill has  accommodated  most  of  their  concerns.  I
would like to thank them for their time and valuable contributions.

I will now highlight a few clauses of the Bill. There  has  been  a  general
acceptance of  the  lowering  of  the  admission  age  in  both  public  and
independent schools, from age six turning seven to age five turning  six  by
June 30 in the year of admission to Grade  1.  However,  in  special  cases,
parents can make representations  to  the  department  for  admission  at  a
younger age if this is in the best interests of the learner.

Those who had fears that clause 3 - curriculum and assessment -  was  giving
powers to the Minister to determine the content of the syllabus and  control
examinations have been accommodated. The Minister will determine a  national
curriculum statement indicating the minimum outcomes  or  standards,  and  a
national process and procedures for the assessment of  learner  achievement.
Surely, if we agree that we are one nation, we cannot  help  but  support  a
Bill that calls for minimum standards and brings about  portability  between
schools?

Xa bendikwazile ukusa umntwana wam  kwizikolo  ezizimeleyo,  ezibiza  iimali
ezinkulu, ndaza ndawudla umsebenzi,  ndanyanzeleka  ukuba  ndimse  kwizikolo
zikaRhulumente,  kufuneka  umntwana  wam  akwazi  ukulunga  nalapho,  angabi
nangxaki.  Kukwanjalo  xa  ndiwine  ilotto,  ndafuna  ukusa   umntwana   wam
kwisikolo esizimeleyo, ndimthabathe umntwana wam  eXhora,  ndimse  kwisikolo
esiseRhawutini kuba ndiwine iloto, makakwazi  umntwana  wam  ukufika  alunge
kweso sikolo. NguRhulumente  yedwa  onakho  ukuyigada  loo  nto,  ngokugcina
umgangatho wemfundo kuzo zonke izikolo zeli lizwe ukwizinga  eliphakamileyo.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[If I was able to send my child to a private  school  that  cost  a  lot  of
money, and unfortunately lost my job, and was forced to send him or  her  to
a public school, my child should be able to fit in  well  and  cope  in  the
school. Similarly, if I have won the lotto and want to send my  child  to  a
private school in Gauteng from a rural school such as eXhora, the same  type
and standard of education should exist there. It is  the  responsibility  of
the Government to safeguard the situation by making sure that  education  in
all the schools of this country is of a high standard.]

To show that the determination of the curriculum by the  Government  is  not
peculiar to South Africa, I would like to share with the House the  National
Education Act, BE 2542 (1999) of the Kingdom of Thailand. Section  15(1)  of
that Act states, and I quote:


  Formal education shall specify the aims,  methods,  curricula,  duration,
  assessment and evaluation conditional to its completion.

On educational standards and quality assurance, section 47 of the  same  Act
states, and I quote:


  There shall be a system of educational quality assurance  to  ensure  the
  improvement of educational quality and standards at all  levels.  Such  a
  system shall comprise both internal and external quality  assurance.  The
  system, criteria and methods for quality assurance shall be as stipulated
  in the ministerial regulations.

Surely, we are not even close to what is being said there?  But  people  are
already filled with misgivings.

Clause 4 of this Bill proposes that a learner should be accompanied  by  his
or her  parent  or  a  person  designated  by  the  parent  at  disciplinary
proceedings. It is important to note that ``parent'' in  the  principal  Act
is defined as including a guardian  for  those  learners  who  do  not  have
parents. The Bill has been further  amended  to  protect  the  SGBs  against
parents who deliberately  do  not  accompany  their  children  in  order  to
frustrate the disciplinary procedure.

Clause 5 deals with the prohibition of initiation practices in  all  schools
as these impinge on a learner's human rights and his or her human dignity.

Clause 10 - the first appointment or appointment after a  break  in  service
of an educator - is the  most  important  and  most  misunderstood  proposed
amendment in this Bill. It is at the core  of  transformation.  Some  of  us
received a number of telephone calls and letters from concerned  members  of
the community. Fortunately, once we had discussed and clarified  the  issues
with them, they were satisfied and agreed on the  relevance  and  importance
of this clause.

They wrongly believed that this clause was  replacing  the  current  way  in
which posts are filled in the education sector, as the hon  Ntuli  was  also
saying.  They  believed  that  there  would  no  longer  be  any  Government
bulletins for  educator  vacancies;  that  prospective  educators  would  no
longer go through interviews; that the  school  governing  bodies  would  no
longer be involved in the selection of teachers in their schools;  that  all
first-appointment  or  appointment-after-break-in-service  educators   would
come through this route and this route only; and that these educators  would
be forced to go to those schools. There are many other  misconceptions  that
they harboured.

This cannot be further  from  the  truth.  This  proposed  system  will  run
parallel to the current one, as contained in section  6(3)(a).  This  clause
addresses a small, specific group, ie educators who are being appointed  for
the fist time or after a break in their service.  We  are  probably  talking
about less than 1% of about 400 000 teachers in our country.  As  we  speak,
we have a number of these newly  qualified  teachers  who  are  roaming  our
streets in desperate  need  of  assistance  to  find  jobs.  Some  of  these
prospective teachers have never seen a bulletin on teacher vacancies.

On the other hand, in the rural areas a number of  schools  are  crying  out
for teachers. Some of them have been without  maths,  science  and  commerce
teachers and teachers of other subjects for more than a year.  Even  in  our
former Model C schools, there are those that genuinely want  to  incorporate
other race groups in their staff complements, but do  not  know  how  to  go
about it. Even after advertising through the bulletin, they  have  not  been
successful.

Andithethi  ukuba  kunokuthi  kanti  zikhona  izikolo,  ezikade   zimhlophe,
ezinabantwana abaliqela abamnyama kungoku nje,  apho  iititshala  ezimhlophe
ezikwezo  zikolo  zisacinga  ukuba  kulilungelo   lomlungu   ukuba   atitshe
umntwana, kodwa, kuba kusekho  abantwana  abamnyama  kwezo  zikolo,  zicinge
ukuba akulunganga  ukuba  kubekho  umntu  omnyama  otitshayo  kwezo  zikolo.
Izikolo  ezinjalo  ke  zona  zinokuba  ziba  nexhala  xa  kusiza  into   eza
kuchukumisa kwiinto ezinjengezo. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[There may be former white or Model C schools that have admitted some  black
learners, where white teachers still think that a white person  is  entitled
to teach a child, but, although  there  are  now  black  learners  at  those
schools, it is not a good thing for black teachers  to  be  employed  there.
Such schools should  be  concerned  when  new  legislation  is  passed  that
impacts on their status.]

The main aim of this amendment is to receive and process  applications  from
first-time applicants or applicants returning after a break in service,  and
to match them  with  vacant  posts  after  consulting  the  relevant  school
governing bodies.

This clause will also create a window of opportunity for a number of  young,
newly qualified educators who are  currently  volunteering  their  services,
free  of  charge,  at  a  number  of  schools.  The   provincial   education
departments will get to know them and help  them  where  possible,  provided
they submit their profiles to the province. Is this asking too much?

Let us open our hearts and love them enough to invite them to  our  schools,
irrespective of their backgrounds. Their main sin is that they do  not  have
experience. All they need is to be given a chance to prove themselves.  This
Bill will provide the mechanism.
The hon Ntuli is concerned about  regulations,  saying  regulations  do  not
come before this House. If we are legislators, as I think we  are,  we  know
that if the hon the Minister for  whatever  reason  oversteps  the  mark  in
regulations, we are there to  bring  him  to  order,  because  there  is  no
regulation that can go beyond what is in the Act. And  when  we  talk  about
regulations, we find that they follow any Act in any case.

But there is this general fear - I do not know what it is - in  that  people
are so concerned whatever direction we move in. When we talk about  lowering
the age of admission then, despite the court having said that we have to  do
so, the hon Ntuli says: ``No, you  cannot  do  it,  because  of  a  lack  of
resources and facilities''. The fact of the matter is  that  the  court  has
pronounced on this and there is not much we can do  about  it,  because  the
court has the power, as an independent body, to keep us  in  line  with  our
Constitution. [Applause.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, the President said in his closing  remarks
that South Africans are known to say: ``I will show  you  the  way''.  I  am
inviting everybody now to listen to what we are going to  say.  The  age-old
question in education discourse has always been: Who  owns  schools?  Is  it
Government, is it the communities, or is it both? If it is both, who  should
control the schools? This approach to  educational  discourse  is  evidently
not very helpful.  It  lends  itself  to  adversarial  ``us''  and  ``them''
instances. It should be neither total onslaught nor total strategy.

The IFP has always been guided by its policy of pluralism. In terms of  this
policy, which underpins the IFP's vision of education in  South  Africa,  we
feel that we must allow for variety, parental choice and  diversity  in  the
education field. On the basis of our policy we would  and  will,  to  borrow
Voltaire's expression, ``defend to the  death''  the  right  of  independent
schools to exist. The IFP is definitely not in a hurry  to  kill  the  goose
that lays the golden egg.

I think that it has been very important to state our policy right  from  the
start, given the  heat  that  has  been  generated  by  the  Education  Laws
Amendment Bill. Some of this heat has been justified, but  most  of  it  has
been the result of either latent  fears  of  imagined  deprivation  or  pure
ideological leanings. We reject both.

Let me now come to the real stuff, the clauses  of  the  Bill.  The  IFP  is
satisfied with the following clauses. Clause 2 deals with the admission  age
of learners to Grades R and 1, namely four turning five   and  five  turning
six by 30 June in the year of  admission,  respectively.  We  are,  however,
concerned about the fact that the ratios of learners to  educators  are  the
highest in a substantial number of schools in the rural areas.

In respect of clause 3, we are satisfied that the  new  phrase  ``curriculum
and assessment''  to  determine  standards  and  outcomes  does  remove  our
original fears of the strangulation of independent schools. As  far  as  our
reading of  this  clause  is  concerned,  there  is  nothing  that  prevents
independent schools from utilising a different curriculum to reach the  same
outcomes and  standards  as  determined  nationally  for  all  schools.  The
original phrasing of this clause aroused  fears  in  certain  quarters  that
this clause would strangle the independence of independent  schools,  and  I
submit that we now believe that the amendment to this clause  removes  those
fears.

While we support the existence of independent  schools,  together  with  the
educational excellence which they  represent  in  the  midst  of  widespread
educational mediocrity,  we  are  concerned  about  the  prohibitively  high
school fees which these schools charge. But this, of course, is  a  separate
debate.

Let me deal now with the clauses that have generated even more heat.  Clause
10 deals with the first appointment or appointment after a break in  service
of an educator. The memorandum to the Bill states that the  reason  for  the
introduction of this clause is to enable provinces  to  assign  teachers  to
schools which are in the rural areas. We support this,  but  something  else
in the clause  has  raised  the  political  temperatures  of  the  different
parties. The clause says:
  6A.(1)   Despite section 6(3)(a), in the case of a first  appointment  or
           an appointment after one or more years' break in service to  any
           provincial department of education, the employer may -


     (a)     receive  applications  from  first-time  applicants  or   those
     returning after a break in service ...

The word ``may'' suggests that there is an existing process in  addition  to
the one which is being introduced.  We  all  know  that.  But  what  is  the
problem with the existing process? Ask any official and  he  will  tell  you
that the current process is very cumbersome  in  that  it  is  unnecessarily
long. Without any exaggeration, it takes about six months or even a year  to
get a post-Level 1 educator employed. In the meantime the child, who is  the
main focus of our educational endeavours, suffers.

The IFP held a two-day workshop and  we  listened  to  the  frustrations  of
educators with regard to the present system, ie that  it  takes  about  four
months for the provincial department to produce a bulletin.  One  copy  goes
to the region and if the region has 1 000  schools,  it  will  take  another
five months for the region to produce the bulletin for the  1  000  schools.
That is why we say we welcome this clause, because  we  see  it  as  running
parallel to the existing employment  procedures.  We  support  this  process
which runs parallel with, and not in  opposition  to,  the  process  in  the
original Act where governing bodies retain  their  right  to  recommend  the
employment of teachers.

The awarding of loans or bursaries to  educators  in  terms  of  which  they
voluntarily enter into an agreement with the employer to be  transferred  to
areas where they are most needed, as contained in clause 11,  is  a  welcome
development. But as long as the infrastructure in rural areas remains  poor,
a large number of teachers will not be attracted to these areas.

In conclusion, in spite of our major concerns over some of the clauses,  the
IFP wants to do the right thing and supports this Bill. [Applause.]
Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, the previous speaker indeed showed the  way,
but he did not go all the way as far as clause 10 is concerned and I  intend
to go all the way. [Interjections.]

This could have been a very fine piece of legislation were it  not  for  the
provisions of clause 10. The objectives of clause  10  are  laudable.  There
should be an equal spread of qualified teachers across the country  and  new
recruits should be appointed as soon as possible, but the  manner  in  which
this Bill intends to achieve these objectives is wrong. For  example  -  and
the hon the Minister referred  to  this  in  his  speech  -  incentives  for
teachers to teach in the rural areas would have been a much  better  option,
and I hope that that idea will materialise as soon as possible.

In the matter between the governing body of the Settlers  Agricultural  High
School and the head of the education department of the Limpopo province,  in
which the  department  was  instructed  to  reappoint  the  nominee  of  the
governing body, Justice Bertelsmann  established  a  crucial  principle.  He
said:


  As important  as  the  rights  of  educators,  and  in  particular  those
  belonging to previously disadvantaged communities, are,  the  paramountcy
  of children's rights and interests must not be overlooked.

Every piece of education  legislation  should  be  guided  by  what  Justice
Bertelsmann referred to as the ``paramountcy  of  children's  rights'',  and
measured against this guiding  principle  the  content  of  clause  10  fell
short.

A further logical conclusion arising from this judgment is that  the  school
body is best equipped to determine what is in  the  best  interests  of  the
child. And any appointment by the Department of Education, made in terms  of
clause 10, of which the school governing body does not approve, may then  be
tested  in  court  based  on  Justice  Bertelsmann's  judgment,  making  the
contents of this clause null and  void  for  all  practical  purposes.  This
clause should therefore have been deleted, as was proposed  by  the  New  NP
and supported by all the other opposition parties.

There is another reason why this clause should be deleted. Governing  bodies
form a cornerstone of our educational system and their powers should not  be
tampered with. Clause 10 indeed takes away the power of a governing body  to
nominate a specific candidate for  a  post  in  cases  of  new  recruits  or
applicants who have a break in  service  of  one  or  more  years.  Now  the
Charter of the ANC says that the people shall govern, but my  impression  is
that  the  Minister  or  the  Department  of  Education  wants  to   govern.
[Interjections.]

It would be appreciated if the hon the Minister could  shed  more  light  on
the meaning of clause 10, because I got the  impression  when  the  previous
speaker spoke that even he was under the impression that we have a  parallel
procedure here. During the committee stage it was presented as  an  enabling
clause, in terms of which a school governing body may follow  the  procedure
as outlined in the clause, but is not compelled to do so. It  was  presented
to the committee in this  context.  In  other  words,  if  governing  bodies
choose to do so, they may still make recommendations  for  new  appointments
in terms of section 6(3)(a) of the Employment of Educators Act.

But my submission is that governing bodies have no option but to follow  the
new procedure as outlined in clause 10 as regards  the  appointment  of  new
recruits. The ``may'' refers to the employer and not to the governing  body.
So if the employer, and that is the  Department  of  Education,  decides  to
follow the procedure as outlined in the new clause 10,  then  the  governing
body will have no option but to follow suit. This is how  I  interpret  this
clause, but I stand to be corrected by the Minister.

Lyfstraf word in hierdie wetsontwerp deur klousules 15  en  28  verbied.  Ek
vra nie dat lyfstraf weer ingestel moet word nie, maar al  wat  ek  weet  is
dat 'n gebrek aan dissipline dit feitlik vir onderwysers onmoontlik maak  om
hulle dagtaak na behore te vervul. Volgens  prof  Isak  Oosthuizen  van  die
Potchefstroomse Universiteit,  wat  'n  omvattende  studie  in  dié  verband
gedoen het, is dissipline in skole besig om landwyd ineen te stort.  Volgens
hom is die leemte wat gelaat is deur die  verbod  op  lyfstraf  nog  nie  na
behore deur alternatiewe dissiplinêre maatreëls gevul nie.

Miskien is daar  twee  redes  hiervoor:  òf  onderwysers  is  nie  behoorlik
ingelig  oor  die  alternatiewe  strafmaatreëls  soos  uiteengesit  in   die
handleiding van die departement nie,  òf  hierdie  maatreëls  help  nie.  So
tussen hakkies, ek stem nie met die gevolgtrekking in die  handleiding  saam
dat lyfstraf lei tot groeiende  sosiale  geweld  nie.  Hulle  het  my  amper
doodgeslaan op skool en ek kan nie onthou dat ek al  ooit  skuldig  was  aan
sosiale geweld nie.

Miskien moet die Minister 'n ondersoek laat doen oor die  ineenstorting  van
dissipline op skoolvlak en die suksesvolle implementering, al dan  nie,  van
die handleiding oor alternatiewe maatreëls. Respek is een  van  die  waardes
wat in die hersiene kurrikulum beklemtoon word en miskien moet dit juis  ook
gekwalifiseer word as respek vir gesag, wat op  die  ou  end  kan  help  dat
dissipline op skoolvlak herstel word. (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[In this Bill corporal punishment is prohibited by clauses 15 and 28.  I  am
not asking for the reinstatement of corporal punishment, but I do know  that
a lack of discipline is making  it  virtually  impossible  for  teachers  to
perform their daily task properly. According  to  Prof  Isak  Oosthuizen  of
Potchefstroom University, who has conducted a comprehensive  study  in  this
regard, discipline  in  schools  is  starting  to  collapse  throughout  the
country. According to him, the void left by the ban on  corporal  punishment
has not yet been adequately filled by alternative disciplinary measures.

There may be two reasons for this: either teachers have  not  been  properly
informed of the alternative punitive measures set out  in  the  department's
manual, or these measures are ineffective. By the way, I do not  agree  with
the conclusion in the manual  that  corporal  punishment  leads  to  growing
social violence. They virtually beat me to death  at  school  and  I  cannot
remember ever having been guilty of social violence.

Possibly the Minister should order an investigation  into  the  collapse  of
discipline  at  school   level   and   the   successful,   or   unsuccessful
implementation of the manual on alternative measures. Respect is one of  the
values that is emphasised in the revised curriculum and  perhaps  it  should
also be qualified as respect for authority, which  in  the  long  run  could
help in re-establishing discipline at school level.]

As I indicated at the beginning of my speech,  the  New  NP  cannot  support
this Bill on account of clause 10.

Mrs  D  G  NHLENGETHWA:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  by   proposing   these
amendments we in the ANC want to steadily transform  the  education  system,
bring unity, have close working relationships with schools, parents,  school
governing bodies and learners, and promote the best interests of the child.

This Bill  seeks  to  address  cases  in  which  a  learner  has  to  attend
disciplinary proceedings in that  the  learner  must  be  accompanied  by  a
parent or guardian. A parent may nominate a person to attend on his  or  her
behalf. If the parent ignores the invitation  and  decides  not  to  attend,
this Bill allows the presiding officer to continue with the  proceedings  in
the parent's absence.

The Bill also promotes the best interests of the minor learner  when  giving
evidence as a witness. A governing body is allowed to  appoint  a  competent
person, an intermediary, to assist the minor learner in testifying  at  such
proceedings. The school governing body is required to do this if it  appears
that the witness may suffer undue mental stress in giving  evidence  without
assistance. This also applies in cases in which a  minor  learner  testifies
in disciplinary proceedings that involve an educator.

There are also amendments in this Bill that  prohibit  initiation  practices
in the education system. Usually these  practices  are  conducted  on  newly
admitted learners or students. According to the report of the  Human  Rights
Commission, these  practices  are  still  being  conducted  in  schools.  An
initiation practice forces a person to do what he or she does  not  want  to
do. For example, a new learner in a particular  school  is  not  allowed  to
take a shower. He or she must use the outside tap and wash without soap.  He
or she may be ordered to crawl like a crocodile or  imitate  the  sounds  of
different animals.

All these violent practices lead to harm, and humiliate  and  undermine  the
fundamental rights and dignity of a  person.  That  is  wrong.  Disciplinary
action must be taken against a person found guilty of  such  misconduct.  As
the ANC, we condemn these violent practices because they create  hatred  and
that is against our policy.

Regarding clause 10: ``First  appointment  or  appointment  after  break  in
service of educator'', the media misinterpreted this clause,  and  this  has
confused the public and some of the members to my left.  They  lobbied  each
other, saying that this clause must be deleted.  We  in  the  ANC  see  this
clause as very important in bettering the lives of our people.

Asikakhohlwa njalo ngebantfu baseNingizimu Afrika, ngekutsandza kwabo  i-ANC

Kwalabafundzisako. (Translation of Swati paragraphs follows.)

[We are not forgetful of the love the  people  of  South  Africa  showed  by
standing in long queues for a long time in the scorching  sun  because  they
wanted to vote for the ANC. So, our proposal  is  that  priority  should  be
given to those teachers who got their  training  through  Government  loans,
especially those who are still  searching  for  jobs.   Some  of  them  have
resorted to selling insurance policies. We, the ANC, propose that a  certain
strategy should be put in place to make it possible for  those  teachers  to
be employed so that they can pay back  the  Government  loans  which  should
continue to help other students.

This amendment states that a new teacher or former teacher who wants  to  be
re-employed should forward his or  her  application  to  the  Department  of
Education. In turn, the Department of Education will then sit down with  the
national school boards association and discuss the matter in order to  place
that teacher in a school that has a shortage of the skills that the  teacher
has, and see to it that the teacher is employed in that  particular  school.
That could even  be  done  without  following  the  procedures  embodied  in
section 6(3)(a) of the Employment of Educators Act.]

We are not interfering with section 6(3)(a).  The  power  of  the  SGB  will
always be there, I would like to say to Mr Aucamp. In this clause  there  is
nothing that erodes  the  powers  of  the  SGB.  Thishela  utawucashwa  bese
utfunyelwa esikolweni lapho adzingeka khona. [A  teacher  will  be  employed
and then deployed to wherever the teacher's skills are needed.]

I want to give an example. I am one  of  the  victims  who  waited  for  the
bulletin and applied. I underwent 16 interviews at  different  schools,  but
none of the interviews resulted in an appointment. This was  because  of  my
involvement in politics. My rights were  violated.  I  was  denied  a  post.
Through this amendment there are many victims outside  like  me  -  who  are
qualified, who used Government study loans - who can be helped. We  want  to
address those incidents.

An applicant, like any other  applicant  in  the  private  sector,  has  the
discretion of either accepting  or  declining  the  post.  There  is  a  cry
outside that the clause aims  to  force  teachers  to  go  to  rural  areas.
Teaching posts  are  not  in  rural  areas  only,  and  this  is  a  ``may''
provision, not a ``must'' provision.

This process will also assist in the  fair  distribution  of  well-qualified
educators, so that there will  be  good,  quality  education  all  over  the
country. This kind of exercise will encourage many  young  people  from  all
over South Africa to opt for the teaching profession.

In conclusion, I would like to  remind  all  parents,  guardians  and  care-
givers that all children aged between seven and 15 are required  by  law  to
go to school. If a child is going to school for the first time in 2003,  the
child should be registered now - in September 2002 - at the  school  nearest
his or her home. To register one will need  to  produce  the  child's  birth
certificate or ID and an immunisation card.

Once registered, the school may ask the parent to pay school  fees.  If  the
parent cannot afford to pay school fees, the parent may  apply  for  partial
or full exemption. No child should be  turned  away  from  a  public  school
because his or her parent cannot afford to pay school fees. No child  should
be excluded from any school activity or feeding scheme  because  he  or  she
does not have a school uniform.

I also want to thank those who stood up and  responded  to  the  President's
call for ``the year of volunteers'', especially women who felt the pain  and
gave love to orphans, homeless children, poor people and pensioners. I  also
thank those women who assisted in  the  nutrition  schemes  by  feeding  the
children. [Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Chairperson, the Education Laws Amendment Bill, in  the  form
in which it was introduced, sparked  a  fair  measure  of  immediate  public
concern. The telephones calls some of us received and the flurry of  letters
by post and e-mail attest to the keen interest South Africans  have  in  the
education of their children. This  reaction  in  itself  proves  that  South
Africans as a nation are attuned to  the  need  to  prepare  South  Africa's
future leadership.

The wide range of organisations that delegated  representatives  to  express
their opinions at the portfolio committee hearings and the quality of  their
contributions were encouraging. While we value and welcome  all  inputs,  it
would  be  useful  if  individuals  would   follow   the   lead   of   these
representatives and study a Bill before commenting on it.

It is a fair guess that many of the concerns  that  were  expressed  by  the
representatives  who  made  submissions  have  been  addressed  by  way   of
amendments to the Bill that  were  agreed  to  in  the  committee.  The  UDM
supports the amended versions. We voted accordingly in the committee.

Throughout the committee meetings, the UDM argued for the total deletion  of
clause 10, which allows the employer to appoint newly trained educators  and
those who are returning after a break in service to posts  at  schools.  The
main grounds for this argument revolve around concerns  about  the  possible
sidestepping  of  school  governing   bodies   without   consultation,   the
possibility of political appointments being made, and  the  lack  of  choice
being allowed the affected educator.

In consideration of the enormity of the need which  exists  on  the  ground,
however, the UDM has decided instead to lend its support  to  the  amendment
to this clause proposed by the ANC. It is recognised that  unless  something
drastic is done to address  the  problems  attendant  on  sending  qualified
educators to institutions where their skills are desperately  required,  the
best interests of a successful education system cannot be served.

In this context, the argument is noted that all school governing  bodies  do
not necessarily function with equal efficiently and that  there  is  a  need
for intervention by  the  department  to  ensure  that  children  in  poorly
staffed rural and urban schools are given a better  education  dispensation.
Some callers who spoke about this matter mistakenly  understood  the  change
to mean that all educators would be redeployed by the department.  This,  of
course, is certainly not the case. Clause 10 provides  that  there  will  be
consultation - and assurances have been  given  by  the  director-general  -
before new graduates and returning educators are appointed at schools.

The position we have taken on clause 10  we  are  now  adopting  as  far  as
clause 11 is concerned as well. This clause  determines  how  recipients  of
bursaries will be appointed.

Despite having  taken  a  strong  position  on  these  two  clauses  in  the
committee and in the  spirit  of  the  accommodating  manner  in  which  the
parties in the committee, particularly the chairman of the committee,  dealt
with the Bill as a whole, the  UDM  now  offers  its  full  support  to  the
Education Laws Amendment Bill as amended. [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, hon Minister  and  colleagues,  everyone  in  this
House would probably agree  that  when  democracy  finally  dawned  in  this
country,  public  education  was  probably  in   more   need   of   thorough
transformation than any other sector.

There was and is an urgent need for norms and  standards  that  will  ensure
equity of provision and ensure that the past  control  and  manipulation  of
social and political behaviour will not be repeated. In  this  respect,  the
Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill  is  necessary.  However,  there  has  been
mounting concern that the framework for  educational  transformation  within
this Bill could itself easily become a tool for social engineering.

The centralist tendencies of the ANC are strongly evident  in  the  Ministry
of Education, and the efficacy of the  outcomes-based  methodology  that  is
central to the new curriculum has been widely questioned, just as  its  very
specific reference to what and how children learn  raises  questions  around
programmed conformity.

The ACDP proposed that clause 3 of this Bill be amended to read:


  The Minister may, by notice in the Gazette determine -


     (a)    a national curriculum statement indicating the minimum  academic
          standards and limited to broad  terms  such  that  it  allows  for
          sufficient   freedom   of   conscience,   belief,   religion   and
          interpretation;


     (b)    assessment guidelines for learner achievement so as to  maintain
          a national standard with assessment instruments  being  determined
          by the provinces and independent examination boards.

The ACDP also proposed that clauses 9, 26, 27 and  30  be  amended  in  line
with this.
Although the Minister insisted that what was contained in the ACDP  proposal
was the intention of the department, the ANC, the DP, the UDM  and  the  IFP
collectively voted against it, and the curriculum statement and process  for
the assessment of learner achievement  contemplated  in  the  Bill  will  be
applicable to both public and independent schools. In an era when  diversity
is generally perceived to have  value,  a  single  national  curriculum  and
assessment tool are seen  by  many  as  the  department's  progress  towards
imposing a single state-controlled national examination  system,  which  the
Minister has promised. At the same time clause 10, which  addresses  a  very
real concern and will help facilitate the placement of teachers,  will  also
further undermine the powers  of  school  governing  bodies  and  allow  the
Minister to impose placements on communities without their approval.

This Bill,  which  exercises  more  control  over  independent  schools  and
undermines school governing bodies, is of serious  concern  to  communities,
but it especially threatens faith-based, independent and  home  schools.  It
is for these  reasons  and  in  the  interests  of  freedom,  democracy  and
diversity that the ACDP will vote against this Bill.

Cha, akunjalo.

Okokuqala  ngiyazibuza  ukuthi  obani  abalwa  lapha   bethi   akube   khona
amagoverning  bodies  ezikoleni?   KwakunguKhongolose,   hhayi   la   amanye
amaqembu. Amagoverning bodies asazoqhubeka abaqashe othisha. Othisha  abasha
kuphela abazoqashwa umnyango.  Nalapho  umnyango  uzoxoxisana  namagoverning
bodies.  Uthisha  oyothunyelwa  esikoleni  kuyobe   kunguthisha   ohambisana
nesidingo  kanye  nesikhala  leso  esikhona.  Okunye  okusikhathazayo  thina
singuKhongolose ukuthi  iningi  lezindlu  zothisha  bezikole  zethu  azifani
nezikole  zethu.  Uthi  uma  ubona  izingane  egcekeni   lesikole,   uzibone
zinhlanga zonke ujabule. Kodwa uma usubona othisha endlini  yabo  bona  babe
uhlanga olulodwa vo. [Ihlombe.]

Kuwona  lo  mthetho  siphinde  sithi  othisha  abafundisayo  abazithuthukisa
ngemali kaHulumeni, uma sebeqedile umNyango wezeMfundo awube  nalo  ilungelo
lokumthatha phela lowo thisha umuse esikoleni adingeka kuso.  Kungani  sisho
kanje  na?  Yingoba  sinenkinga  ezikoleni  zasemakhaya.   Azinabo   othisha
abaqeqeshwe   ngokwanele.   Lo   mcimbi    uzophonsa    itshe    esivivaneni
sokuthuthukiswa kwezindawo  zasemakhaya.  Nakhona-ke  belu  ukuthi  kuyacaca
ukuthi namhlanje sibona lawa amanye amaqembu ethi abangaqashwa lab'  othisha
abasha njengoba besengishilo  ukuthi  baqhamukaphi,  kuyacaca  futhi  ukuthi
bangothisha  bebala  elimnyama.  Bamnyama  iningi  labo.  Ukuba  bebemhlophe
iningi labo, ngiyakholwa ukuthi  lo  mthetho  ubuzoshaywa  ngo-Elethu  lapha
kule Ndlu.

Ngicela  ukuthatha  naleli  thuba  futhi  ngisekhona  la  ukuba  ngikhumbuze
imiphakthi yonke yakuleli  ukuthi  okokuqala  uHulumeni  oholwa  uKhongolose
ukubekile wangangabaza ukuthi izingane azibe nelungelo  eligcwele  lokuthola
imfundo, ingabi bikho neyodwa ingane  ekhishwa  esikoleni  ngenxa  yokungabi
namali, ngenxa yokungabi nanyufomu, ngenxa yokungabi nezinye nje  izimfanelo
ezidingakalayo. Akungagodlwa futhi  izincwadi  ngoba  ingane  ingayikhokhile
imali yesikole.  Akumele  nakancane  nakancane  ukuthi  ingane  ihlukunyezwe

imiphakathi, othisha  namagoverning  bodies  ukuthi  lolu  daba  awalubheke,
axhase uHulumeni.

Akukho  mali  uHulumeni  ayithathayo   ezikoleni.   Yonke   imali   enqunywa
esikoleni, inqunywa ngabazali  behlangene  namaGoverning  Bodies.  UHulumeni
akafuni ngisho isenti lesikole. (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Ms P N MNANDI: Chairperson, Minister Kader  Asmal,  hon  members,  comrades
and friends, let me start off by taking this opportunity to thank all  those
who responded to the ANC's call that this year should be made  the  year  of
the volunteer. I would like to thank all  communities  who  played  a  major
role in tidying up our schools.
In July this year we visited Free State schools as the  Portfolio  Committee
on Education. We saw many teachers there who  were  unemployed.  Others  had
volunteered to teach children in schools and we were told  that  their  work
was very commendable. Forward volunteers, forward! [Applause.] In  the  Free
State, we found white teachers who taught in  farm  schools  and  Boer  farm
owners who participated in the running of schools, mainly through  providing
vehicles for transporting children. Haak Vrystaat! [Applause.]

Let me address myself to this Act that we are amending today. My  colleagues
have put their views across to their hearts' content. I will  also  take  my
turn. Our main problem is this: We in South Africa say that everyone  has  a
right to be trained for their chosen  career.  At  the  same  time  we  have
massive numbers of young people who chose to be trained  as  teachers.  They
have long since finished their studies but to this day they have never  been
employed. We now have a problem in  that  the  Department  of  Education  is
unable to allocate funding to cater for those teachers because they  do  not
communicate with the department, they approach schools directly.

Research findings indicate  that  about  20  000  to  30  000  teachers  are
unemployed. Most of these unemployed teachers live in Limpopo,  the  Eastern
Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. At the  same  time,  there  are  schools  which  are
unable to fill vacancies because they  cannot  find  suitable  teachers  who
could fill those vacancies. In certain instances,  school  governing  bodies
vehemently refuse to employ new teachers and say  that  they  only  want  to
employ experienced teachers. That  is  surprising,  because  where  would  a
young person fresh from college gain that experience?

Difficult as that situation is, there is also this  devastating  problem  of
HIV/Aids. It does not discriminate as to whether one is experienced or  not.
The Department of Education is unable to do anything because the law  states
that it is only the governing bodies that employ teachers. This  is  a  real
dilemma. That is why today we say that the Department  of  Education  should
be given the power to create opportunities for those teachers, because  most
of them were financed by the Government in their studies.  Some  members  in
this House are saying that instead of giving  the  Department  of  Education
this power to employ new teachers,  we  are  completely  sweeping  away  the
powers of governing bodies. No, that is not true.

I ask myself: Who fought here for the establishment of governing bodies?  It
was the ANC and not the other parties. The governing  bodies  will  continue
to employ teachers. It is only new teachers who  will  be  employed  by  the
department.  Even  in  that  situation,  the  department  will  consult  the
governing bodies. A teacher will be sent to a school in accordance with  the
needs of the school and will be  suitable  to  fill  that  vacancy.  Another
concern to us, as the ANC, is that  most  of  our  school  staff  rooms  are
different to our schools. One becomes happy when one sees  children  of  all
races in the schoolyard. But when one goes to  the  staff  room,  one  finds
that the teachers are of one race only. [Applause.]

In this Bill we also say that once those teachers who are teaching  and  who
use Government money to improve themselves  have  completed  their  studies,
the Department of Education should have the right to place them  where  they
are needed most. Why do we say that? It is  because  we  are  faced  with  a
problem in rural schools. Those  schools  do  not  have  adequately  trained
teachers. This proposed action will contribute to the development  of  rural
areas. Today other political parties are  saying  that  these  new  teachers
should not be employed. I have already  stated  where  those  teachers  come
from and it is clear that they are black teachers. Most of them  are  black.
If the majority of them had been white, I am convinced that this Bill  would
have been passed with a resounding majority in this House.

Whilst I am still here, I would  also  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to
remind  all  communities  in  this  country  that  the  ANC-led   Government
unambiguously stated that all children should have the  right  to  education
and that not a single child should be taken out of school because of a  lack
of fees, uniform and other requirements. Books should not be  withheld  from
children if they have not paid school fees. A child should not  be  harassed
at all if he or she has not paid school fees. However,  our  observation  is
that that practice still continues in schools. We would like  to  appeal  to
communities, teachers and governing bodies to look into that matter  and  to
support the Government.

The Government does not take  money  at  all  from  schools.  All  fees  are
decided upon by parents in  schools  together  with  governing  bodies.  The
Government does not require even a single cent from schools.]

Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, I have listened to  the  previous  speaker,  the
hon Ms Mnandi, and I am sorry to say that even on an  issue  like  education
it seems that we are really miles apart, and  that  is  a  tragedy.  In  her
speech the hon member made a number of references to the whole  question  of
school governing bodies. Somebody should tell the  hon  member  that  school
governing bodies consist of the parents in that community. So  what  is  the
problem? That is the way it should be, and how can she have a  problem  with
the parents from her own community?

Ek  wil  vandag  sonder  huiwering  aan  die  agb  Minister   sê   dat   die
onderwysprofessie in Suid-Afrika in die  moeilikheid  is.  Daar  bestaan  'n
groter wordende krisis in die onderwysprofessie en daar  is  verskeie  redes
hiervoor. Een van die  oorsake  is  die  hopeloos  onvoldoende  markverwante
salarisse wat  onderwysers  verdien.  Tweedens  bestaan  daar  `n  duidelike
huidige en toekomstige krisis in die beroep omdat onderwysers die  professie
nie meer aantreklik vind nie,  en  toetreders  al  minder  en  minder  word.
Heeltemal te min onderwysers word opgelei teenoor dié wat  die  beroep  tans
verlaat.

Die meerderheid skole het nie eers beheerliggame nie, en dié skole  wat  wel
oor beheerliggame beskik se situasie word aanhoudend verder  bemoeilik  deur
nuwe wetgewing  wat  deurgevoer  word.  Enige  nuwe  maatreëls  wat  hierdie
groeiende krisis vergroot kan nie deur die VF ondersteun word  nie,  en  ons
sal daarteen stem.

Alhoewel positiewe bepalings in die wetsontwerp vervat  is,  en  ons  kennis
daarvan  neem,  is  daar  ook  bepalings   wat   hierdie   krisis   in   die
onderwysprofessie vergroot. Daarna is reeds  verwys,  spesifiek  wat  betref
klousule 10. `n Mens kan van  alle  kante  na  klousule  10  kyk,  maar  die
slotsom kan nie anders wees as dat die  bevoegdhede  van  skoolbeheerliggame
verminder word nie, en dít is nie aanvaarbaar nie. Inteendeel,  as  ons  die
skoolbeheerliggaam en die gemeenskap wil bemagtig, dan kan `n mens  dit  nie
doen nie.

Siende dat ek baie min tyd oor  het,  wil  ek  ten  slotte  na  klousule  11
verwys. Wanneer daar later op beurshouers die verpligting  geplaas  word  om
diens te doen dáár waar die departement dit goed ag, dan is dit  seker  reg,
maar `n mens kan ten minste vra dat beurshouers aanvanklik in kennis  gestel
word oor dit wat vir hulle vorentoe wag.

Die VF kan nie hierdie wetgewing steun nie, en ons wil vir die  Minister  sê
dat die onderwyskrisis by die dag groter word. Daar  sal  dramatiese  stappe
geneem  moet  word,  en  dit  moet  baie  vinnig  geskied.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Today I will  tell  the  hon  the  Minister  without  hesitation  that  the
teaching profession in South Africa is  in  trouble.  There  is  a  steadily
growing crisis in the teaching profession, and  there  are  several  reasons
for this. One of the reasons for this is the hopelessly  inadequate  market-
related salaries earned by teachers. Secondly, there is  clearly  a  present
and future crisis within the profession because teachers no longer find  the
profession attractive and there are fewer and  fewer  new  entrants  to  the
profession. Hopelessly too few teachers are being trained compared to  those
leaving the profession.

The majority  of  schools  do  not  even  have  governing  bodies,  and  the
situation in those schools that  do  have  governing  bodies  is  constantly
being hampered by new legislation that is being  passed.  Any  new  measures
that would cause this growing crisis to escalate cannot be supported by  the
FF, and we will vote against them.
Although some positive provisions have been embodied in  the  Bill,  and  we
take cognisance of them, there are also provisions  which  are  exacerbating
the crisis in the teaching profession. This has already  been  referred  to,
specifically with regard to clause 10. One can examine clause  10  from  all
angles, but one can come to the conclusion  that  the  powers  of  governing
bodies are being reduced, and that is unacceptable. On the contrary,  if  we
want to empower the school governing body and the community, then we  cannot
do that.

Since I have very little time left, I would like, in  conclusion,  to  refer
to clause 11. When bursary holders are eventually obliged to  perform  their
duties wherever the department deems fit, that is probably  acceptable,  but
one could at least ask that bursary holders be informed in advance  of  what
awaits them in the future.

The FF cannot support this legislation, and we want  to  tell  the  Minister
that the teaching crisis is escalating by the  day.  Drastic  measures  will
have to be taken, and this must happen very quickly.]
Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson, development in education  is  taking  place  too
quickly and if principals do not run their schools,  the  schools  will  run
them down. It is for that reason that education laws have to be attended  to
regularly to ensure that they keep pace with modern times.

We accept that the admission age for both public  and  private  schools  has
been lowered, depending on the circumstances prevailing in the area  of  the
school, as well as the circumstances of  the  learner.  Our  experience  has
shown that learners who have gone through early learning centres and/or  the
Grade R class, experience no problems in assimilating  lessons.  We  welcome
the fact that the Minister will only  determine  or  describe  the  national
curriculum statement. Educationists will add the flesh, in keeping with  the
values and principles determined by the Minister.

Our philosophy has always been that the dignity of an individual should  not
be impinged upon. No one should ever be treated in a demeaning and  inhumane
manner.  Initiation  practices  and  corporal  punishment  in  schools   are
unacceptable as they border on barbarism in some instances. The  result  has
been maiming or death in those  rare,  yet  unfortunate,  circumstances.  We
ask: Why do it in the first place? It is not necessary!

We note the concern that the  Minister  will  feature  more  than  the  MECs
responsible for education in the provinces. We note that  education  at  all
levels, excluding tertiary education, is  a  concurrent  competence  between
the national and provincial spheres of government. We  hold  the  view  that
regulations may be made by the MECs and agreed upon at the meetings  of  the
Council of Education Ministers. The UCDP supports the Bill. [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the amendment  of  a  piece  of  legislation  is
usually informed by problems on the  ground  that  the  present  legislation
cannot address.

There is currently a fear that this amendment may be aimed primarily at  the
reduction of the powers of some school governing bodies. If this were  true,
it would be unfortunate in the extreme. This does not seem  to  be  a  valid
fear as the Bill, in fact, addresses a variety of educational problems,  for
example the admission age of a learner to a public school. It also seeks  to
abolish initiation practices that humiliate and violate  the  human  dignity
of the learner.

The above measures, in my opinion, should bring more good than evil. One  of
the matters that is addressed by this Bill is  the  problem  and  plight  of
rural schools that need a simpler and more  practical  method  of  employing
educators. If many rural schools  are  not  adequately  staffed,  and  urban
schools have the monopoly on  good  teachers,  then  this  problem  must  be
solved. It could be solved by paying an incentive allowance to  teachers  in
rural schools. This, of course, is an expensive option.

Many newly qualified teachers are  unemployed,  and  many  school  governing
bodies are acting as gatekeepers to keep some teachers out.  Some  governing
bodies do not want to transform schools that have  traditionally  kept  some
pupils and teachers out. If this allegation is true, then  we  must  correct
it. How can we explain to young teachers who are unemployed that  there  are
vacancies that they cannot fill because of their race classification?  There
are many young teachers with one or two degrees  who  have  been  unemployed
for more than two years. Some are even considered unfit to teach  their  own
languages, like Zulu and English.

I want to say that we  would  like  to  affirm  the  powers  of  the  school
governing bodies. We would like to affirm fair play, integrity and  justice,
and school governing bodies should be  encouraged  to  maintain  the  unique
character  of  schools  and  a  level  of  professionalism,  competence  and
acceptable behaviour. The PAC will support this Bill.

Ms E GANDHI: Chairperson, hon Minister,  colleagues  and  comrades,  in  the
past week I received a number of  telephones  calls,  letters  and  messages
from a number of  people  expressing  concern  about  the  fate  of  private
schools.
They raised the following issues: Firstly, that the legislation is going  to
erode the powers of the governing bodies in respect of  the  appointment  of
teachers or educators; and, secondly, that this legislation will  take  away
the freedom of private schools in designing their own syllabuses.  They  see
this as a violation of their rights as they believe that they cannot  accept
a curriculum designed by this Government. They wish to have the  freedom  to
design their own syllabuses.

The third issue is that the Minister is usurping their powers  and  that  he
alone is going to design a curriculum for the whole country. They  say,  and
I quote: ``The Bill supposes a  perfect,  almighty  education  Minister  who
will make no serious mistakes and is able to provide the one and  only  best
education for every child in this country.''

Unfortunately, the experiences of the apartheid era have taught some  people
to look for ulterior  motives  in  every  piece  of  legislation  or  policy
drafted by our Government and to doubt the  integrity  and  ability  of  our
Minister. This  is  tragic  and  unfortunate,  especially  as  it  is  being
instigated by some hon members of this august House.

This Bill clearly states, as my colleagues  have  already  pointed  out  ...
[Interjections.] I would like to know who they could be too.

This Bill clearly states, firstly, that the Minister will only intervene  in
making appointments in the case of newly qualified educators and  those  who
wish to return to education after a break in service. Secondly, it does  not
prevent the governing bodies from making their  own  appointments.  Thirdly,
it stipulates that these appointments will be  made  only  after  consulting
the governing body about the specific requirements  of  the  post,  ensuring
that the applicant to be appointed has the  relevant  requirements  and  the
prescribed qualifications.

What further safeguards would be required to ensure that the best  interests
of our children are served? I would really urge those members of  Parliament
who  are  mobilising  members  of  the  community  against  this  piece   of
legislation to look  at  the  broader  picture.  The  Minister's  first  and
foremost responsibility  is  to  ensure  that  the  best  interests  of  the
children of our country are served.

We  have  constitutional  and  legislative  imperatives  to  ensure  equity,
quality and access to education. These can only be facilitated  by  ensuring
that every school has an educator in every class, and that every school  has
educators with all the  required  skills  to  be  able  to  impart  all  the
requirements of the curriculum, including maths, languages, science  and  so
on.

The present position, as my colleagues have already outlined, is  that  some
schools have many maths and science educators while  others  have  none.  By
assigning the new and former educators on a fair basis this  imbalance  will
be corrected. I am convinced that the people who called me and wrote  to  me
do not wish to obstruct transformation or to  retain  the  past  imbalances,
and will therefore reconsider their  objections  once  they  understand  the
provisions of the Bill.

The second issue they raised  was  the  question  of  the  curriculum.  They
believe that the Minister is going to impose a syllabus on private  schools.
The reality, again, is that every child's interests have to  be  taken  into
account. Children should be able to move from one school to another  without
having to start their education afresh because each school has  a  different
curriculum and standards. There has  to  be  some  country-wide  uniformity.
Every child has the right to a quality education.

The Minister, through this Bill, will be able to ensure a minimum degree  of
uniformity and a minimum  standard.  Beyond  that,  schools  will  have  the
flexibility to decide  on  the  details,  the  content  and  the  standards,
provided  they  do  not  fall  below  the  level  set  by  the  Minister  in
regulations.

I want to emphasise that, unlike  the  erstwhile  apartheid  regime,  people
today have the right to comment on just about everything that is being  done
by  the  Government.  In  this  case  the  National  Education  Policy   Act
stipulates in section  6  that  all  regulations  can  be  made  only  after
consultation. So, yes, people will still be able to comment.

I would like to assure those who are fearful of transformation that  we  are
as interested in the education of our children as they are, and we love  our
children as much as they do. We need to transform  our  education  from  the
narrow  authoritarian  orthodox  apartheid  education   to   a   democratic,
empowering education which  would  include  ethical  and  spiritual  values,
diverse cultural traditions, creativity,  critical  thinking,  co-operation,
teamwork, personal responsibility, community-mindedness and a  genuine  love
for learning.

In our democratic South Africa we need support  from  all  sectors  to  work
towards this model of education, and to ensure  that  every  child  has  the
opportunity to obtain quality education and that every child  over  the  age
of five and under the age of 15 is at school and is  given  the  opportunity
to grow up into a patriotic, honest, respectful, responsible  South  African
citizen. We support this Bill and we think that the  aforementioned  can  be
achieved through this Bill. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Igama lamakhosikazi! [In the name  of  women!]  Chair,  hon
Minister, the MF is aware of the necessity to implement efficient policy  in
all sectors, especially education. The amendments  made  in  terms  of  this
policy  are  welcomed,  noting  that  they  allow  for   certain   technical
adjustments and for the proper implementation of the Act.

In noting the dilemma that  the  Education  department  was  faced  with  in
relation to the age at which pupils start school, the MF  strongly  supports
the clarity that the amending Bill will provide in that it will  shed  light
on the subject. The MF feels that the  age  of  admission  for  students  to
Grades R and 1 is appropriate. We strongly support the idea of  an  educated
nation, and if a child is ready for such education,  why  hold  him  or  her
back from getting it?
The MF supports the implementation of the common national  process  for  the
assessment of learner achievement in the Republic as it is felt  that  doing
this will ensure an equitable  process  among  provinces.  The  unacceptable
practices of a number of school governing bodies have been noted. The MF  is
firmly in support of this being brought under control  by  the  introduction
of a code of conduct which may not to be breached.

The recommendations made with regard to  the  employment  of  educators  are
necessary and adequate. We need an educated South Africa. We need  to  reach
our rural communities that  have  minimal  resources  to  access  education.
Furthermore, the performance of educators needs to be  monitored  so  as  to
ensure that our people are receiving the best educators, who  work  hard  to
perform their duties  effectively  and  efficiently.  The  MF  supports  the
Education Laws Amendment Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, do you see what I have here in my hand? It  is
a rubber stamp, and that is what the Portfolio Committee  on  Education  has
become.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That looks more like a desk stamp.

Mr C AUCAMP: We had a session of public hearings  in  which  14  of  the  15
organisations across the board raised serious problems. Then we had  half  a
morning of deliberations, but with the ANC's proposals already on the  table
as were those of the other parties. A week later the chairperson said:  ``We
are old enough to vote.'' And not  one  single  amendment  proposed  by  any
opposition party was accepted.

Twee aspekte van  hierdie  wet  het  van  die  begin  af  alles  gedomineer.
Eerstens is daar die assessering en kurrikulering van privaatskole.  Hierdie
wetsontwerp reguleer nie net die standaard nie,  maar  ook  die  inhoud  van
privaatskole se  kurrikulum.  Daarmee  word  die  grense  van  die  Grondwet
oorskry. Dit gebeur dat geen  onderskeid  getref  word  tussen  openbare  en
privaatskole nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Two aspects of this Act dominated everything  from  the  beginning.  First,
there is the assessment and curriculisation of private  schools.  This  Bill
regulates not only the standard but also the content of  the  curriculum  of
private schools. This transgresses the boundaries of the Constitution.  This
results in no distinction being made between public and private schools.]

And by subjecting private schools to the same  process  of  assessment,  the
very reasons for  their  existence  are  jeopardised.  With  this  Bill  the
Minister has placed public and private schools in the same category.  May  I
ask the Minister whether  he  is  going  to  do  the  same  with  regard  to
financing as well? [Interjections.]

Wat betref personeelvoorsiening in openbare  skole,  ondanks  die  bestaande
wet dat beheerliggame kandidate aanbeveel,  kan  die  departement  nou  self
plasing maak en aanstellings doen. Al  vereiste  is  dat  hulle  vooraf  die
beheerliggaam moet raadpleeg oor die vereistes van die pos en  nie  oor  die
aanstelling nie. Dertien uit die 15 organisasies en al  die  opposisiepartye
in die komitee het beswaar gemaak. Die AEB  het  die  uitspraak  van  regter
Bertelsmann hieroor laat sirkuleer. Die DG  en  die  regsadviseurs  van  die
Departement ontken dat bestuursliggame se magte ingeperk word. Dis  net  nog
'n roete wat gevolg kan word. Al  die  partye  het  gevra  dat  in  die  wet
ingeskryf  word.  Die  ANC  weier.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[With regard to staff provision at public schools, despite the existing  Act
which stipulates that governing bodies recommend candidates, the  department
can now do placements and make appointments itself. The only requirement  is
that they must consult the governing body beforehand about the  requirements
of the  post  and  not  about  the  appointment.  Thirteen  out  of  the  15
organisations and all the opposition parties in the  committee  objected  to
this. The AEB circulated the judgment of Justice Bertelsmann on this  issue.
The DG and the law advisors from the Department  deny  that  the  powers  of
governing bodies are being curtailed. This is merely  another  course  which
can be adapted. All the parties asked that this be  written  into  the  Act.
The ANC has refused.]

I challenge the hon the Minister today to declare openly in his  reply  that
not a single teacher will be forced on a school against the  wishes  of  the
parents, as represented by the governing body. If he cannot do so, then  the
committee was consistently brought under a misapprehension. If he  can,  why
not state it in the Bill?

The  AEB  opposes  this  amending  Bill  here  and,  when  the  time  comes,
throughout the country. [Time expired.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, Azapo supports this Bill,  because  it  is
common  knowledge  ...  [Applause.]  ...  that  throughout  the  history  of
mankind, educational institutions, regulations  and  governing  bodies  have
been established to serve the interests of  society  and  the  interests  of
particular countries at a given moment in time. It is for this  reason  that
we support this Bill because we know that all countries, whilst  maintaining
broad and general educational programmes, have nevertheless developed  their
own peculiar syllabuses to suit their particular needs.

When we studied the Bill we were, however, disturbed by the fact that  there
were no specific provisions for the evaluation  of  teachers.  But  we  were
pleased to note that in terms of the Bill  the  Minister  will  be  able  to
regulate this, because teachers must agree that they must also be  evaluated
for there to be good governance and proper education.

Azapo supports the intention of the Bill when it comes  to  the  appointment
of new teachers and the deployment of these teachers, particularly to  areas
in need. The lowering of the age of admission to  school  is  also  welcome.
However, with regard to this  particular  amendment  to  lower  the  age  of
admission, we submit that this should be accompanied by the  following:  the
provision  of  more  classes   and   other   educational   facilities;   the
investigation and assessment of the  availability  of  Grade  R  facilities;
and, the assessment of teacher-pupil ratios, as they  will  be  affected  by
the new intake.

In short, these changes have significant implications  for  human  resources
and  physical  facilities.  Azapo  supports  this  Bill.   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Chairperson, one of the problems  in  the  analysis
done by many people of the  Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill  is  that  they
merely looked at the amendments,  without  looking  at  the  principal  Acts
which are not recorded in full in the amending Bill.

I want to start by referring to the South African Schools Act, which is  one
of the principal Acts with which the Education Laws  Amendment  Bill  deals.
The South African Schools Act was, in essence, a compromise,  if  you  will,
between  a  superschool-governance  apartheid  structure  enjoying  all  the
resources of both the  government  and  a  capitalist  society  and  a  very
mundane, illegitimate school-committee system in  black  schools  which  had
been abandoned by  parents  and  students  because  of  the  discriminatory,
servile and patronising manner in which it operated under apartheid.

One of the huge leaps of faith that was made by the  South  African  Schools
Act was to place on one level in our schools  a  system  of  legitimate  co-
operative governance that would accommodate a  highly  organised  governance
system in which parents were involved with  enthusiasm,  on  the  one  hand,
with, on the other, education  institutions,  which  had  been  crippled  by
decades of discriminatory  rule  and  in  which  parents  and  students  had
abandoned the undemocratic school governance system.

In having  to  manage  a  co-operative  governance  system  which  tries  to
accommodate  widely  divergent   backgrounds   and   histories   in   school
governance, the Government clearly had to be able to  rely  on  the  ongoing
goodwill of parents, teachers  and  learners  to  make  the  new  governance
system work. This  has  unfortunately  not  happened,  particularly  because
opposition parties like the DP, the FF, the AEB and the  ACDP  have  clearly
demonstrated, on countless occasions, that they are  simply  not  interested
in an equitable, patriotic and nonracial public school  system  which  takes
active parent involvement in  school  governance  into  account  while  also
allowing Government to make the necessary interventions required to  advance
the transformation and democratisation  programme  in  an  education  system
scarred by racism. [Interjections.]

Examples of the undermining and what  I  call  unpatriotic  role  played  by
negative opposition parties are the following: Firstly  outright  opposition
to honour values in education like the building of  respect  among  students
for the national symbols of our new democratic order such as the  flag,  the
national anthem and the new coat of arms; secondly, an insistence on a  form
of Christian National education being forced down the throats  of  everyone,
instead of cultivating  an  understanding  and  a  mutual  respect  for  the
diversity of cultures and religions as Curriculum  2005  requires;  thirdly,
an   insistence   on   introducing   single-language   Afrikaans-instruction
institutions to the exclusion of  speakers  of  other  languages;  fourthly,
regular challenges in court to the right of Government and the  Minister  of
Education in particular  to  manage  the  difficult  transformation  in  the
education process in the interests of  all  schools  in  the  country;  and,
fifthly,  blatant and opportunistic attacks in public and the media  on  the
powers of South Africa's first national black Ministers of Education.

In 1995, almost at the birth of our fledgling  democracy  in  this  country,
there was an unsavoury episode in this Parliament  when  opposition  parties
refused to grant powers of policy-making to the  Minister  of  Education  by
means of the then National Education Policy Act.  Opposition  parties  first
walked out of the portfolio committee when the Bill  had  to  be  voted  on.
Then they took the Bill to the Constitutional Court, even before  Parliament
had debated and voted on the  Bill.  They  then  proceeded  to  boycott  the
debate in Parliament on that Bill.

Now, if ever there was a day of ignominy in this Parliament, a day on  which
the essence of this institution as a  democratic  Parliament  was  blatantly
undermined, it was that day,  13  September  1995,  on  which  predominantly
white opposition parties refused to debate a Bill which would give  a  black
Minister  of  Education   power   over   white   schools.   [Interjections.]
Unfortunately for the opposition parties, their  desperate  bid  to  try  to
hoodwink the Constitutional Court  into  declaring  that  Bill  ultra  vires
boomeranged on them, because the Constitutional Court clearly  rejected  the
notion that a national Minister of Education should not have  the  power  to
declare national policy on education. [Interjections.] Now why  do  I  bring
up that disgraceful incident?

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I believe that  there
is something implicitly racist in what the  hon  member  is  saying.  He  is
suggesting, in fact he  is  implying,  that  the  opposition  parties  voted
against a Bill in 1995 because we were voting against a  black  Minister.  I
believe that there is  something  implicitly  very  racist  about  that,  Mr
Chairman, and I would like you please to consider it very carefully.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I think the Speaker  has  ruled
previously that we are entitled to make comments in this House but  that  we
should steer away from  any  statement  that  would  implicitly  indicate  a
racist tone. I would like to advise that we keep to the guidance offered  by
the Speaker, because inasmuch as one is entitled  to  make  criticisms  that
are of a factual nature, I do not think it would be in order  to  paint  the
opposition party with a uniform paint brush. I would like  to  suggest  that
we follow the guidance of the Speaker.

And, Mr Van den  Heever,  one  other  matter  that  is  of  concern  is  the
statement  you  made  of  opposition  parties  ``trying  to   hoodwink   the
Constitutional Court''. I believe, once again, that when  it  comes  to  the
highest  court  of  the  land  all  members  who  feel  aggrieved  with  any
legislation that is passed have the right to approach that court, and it  is
for the court then to determine whether it will judge for or against.

Hon member, you may now continue.

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Thank you, Chairperson, I accept your ruling.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, thank you very much indeed for your  ruling,  but
I am not quite sure whether you were  asking  the  hon  member  to  withdraw
those remarks or whether you were just cautioning him. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I did caution him and the  hon  member
indicated that he was willing to be guided, and therefore I accept the  bona
fides of his position.

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Now, why do I bring up that incident in  connection
with the National Education Policy Bill during this debate  here  today?  It
is because we are still dealing with the challenge of the opposition to  the
National Education Policy Bill.

In clause 9 of the Education Laws Amendment Bill  we  are  saying  that  the
Minister may make regulations to prescribe a national curriculum  statement,
to prescribe a national process for the assessment of  education  in  public
and independent schools and to prescribe the  admission  age  of  pupils  to
public and independent schools.

The reason it became necessary to redefine the powers of  the  Minister,  in
terms of making regulations, was not to rub  the  noses  of  the  opposition
party in the dirt about the powers of  the  Minister.  A  loophole  had,  in
fact, been discovered in the powers accorded to the  Minister  of  Education
by the National Education Policy Act,  when  in  the  Talya  Harris  school-
admission-age case the Constitutional Court found that policy determined  in
terms of this Act did not bind provinces, parents or independent schools.

It is common legislative practice in  parliaments  all  over  the  world  to
tighten legislation when unforeseen loopholes are  exploited  by  those  who
want to  operate  outside  the  system.  Clause  9  of  the  Education  Laws
Amendment Bill is therefore not being introduced because of a desire  for  a
glut of powers by one Kader Asmal, nor is it a way  for  Minister  Asmal  to
centralise power, or a  devious  scheme  or  plot  on  his  part  to  bypass
Parliament. In fact, we are not dealing with an Asmal piece  of  legislation
per se. We are merely correcting an  oversight  which  occurred  during  the
original formulation of the National  Education  Policy  Act,  an  oversight
which led to the authority of the Minister  being  undermined.  And  in  the
Education Laws  Amendment  Bill  we  are  doing  the  responsible  thing  as
Parliament in tightening up a particular clause in  the  National  Education
Policy Act to avoid chaos in our education system.

With regard to  clause  10,  the  hon  Nhlengethwa  clearly  indicated  from
personal experience the immense problem that new teachers  often  experience
in getting a teaching post. In spite of 16 interviews, she was out of a  job
for three years, while, I am sure, had  there  been  some  departmental  co-
ordination she could have gone into a job  much  more  easily.  It  is  this
deficiency that we are addressing through this particular clause.

As I have already said, our members must learn  that  when  we  are  dealing
with an amending Bill, they must not only read the particular amendment  but
also the principal Act. The principal Act that is amended in  clause  10  is
the Employment of Educators Act. Clause 10  of  the  amending  Bill  clearly
says that section 6(3)(a) of the Employment of Educators Act will remain  in
place. And what  does  that  section  say?  It  says,  and  I  quote:  ``any
appointment in any post  at  a  public  school  may  only  be  made  on  the
recommendation of the school governing body.''

This amendment does not tamper with that  status  of  the  school  governing
body at all. In fact, it merely adds a new layer to  make  the  system  more
flexible. In this amendment we are dealing with a limited  number  of  posts
and a particular category of employees. There will be adequate  consultation
with  the  relevant  school  governing  body.  The  applicant  who  will  be
appointed must match the requirements of the post, and  the  applicant  must
have  the  prescribed  qualifications  for  the  post.   Furthermore,   such
appointments will only be made after all other processes to  fill  the  post
have failed.

Dit is nie waar soos wat  agb  Aucamp  suggereer,  dat  die  meeste  insette
tydens  die  openbare  verhore  gekant  was  teen  wat  die  opposisie,  die
``gewraakte klousules'' in die wetsontwerp noem nie. Ons het  baie  van  die
verteenwoordigers van openbare en  onafhanklike  skole  tydens  die  verhore
selfs gevra watter bewoording hulle in sommige gevalle verkies.

Ek  kan  spesifiek  onthou  dat  verteenwoordigers  van  onafhanklike  skole
byvoorbeeld aangedui het dat hulle tevrede sal wees met die gebruik van  die
woorde, ``Curriculum Statement'' - en ons het dit so verander. Baie van  die
instansies het aangetoon dat  ons  die  kwessie  van  ``assessment''van  die
kurrikulum verder moet omskryf, sodat dit duidelik is dat ons hier  te  doen
het met minimum standaarde en prosesse - en ons het dit gedoen.

En kom ek sê vir die soveelste keer: Die Curriculum Statement  het  te  doen
met  minimum  standaarde,  en  die  assessering  het  te  doen  met  minimum
standaarde. En as daar  bo  en  behalwe  daardie  minimum  standaarde  ander
kwessies in die kurrikulum behandel word - mits dit binne die  Grondwet  van
die land is - sal dit toegelaat word. So  ek  weet  nie  waaroor  die  groot
bohaai is nie.

Ek weet ook nie waaroor die groot lawaai  is  rondom  die  kwessie  van  die
onderrig van waardes in die kurrikulum nie. Hoe kan ouers bevrees  wees  oor
die bou van waardes van mederespek vir mekaar se taal, geloof en kultuur  in
ons land?

Agb Aucamp het selfs so ver gegaan in die portefeuljekomitee om  te  sê  dat
die Minister wil 'n bepaalde  godsdiens  voorskryf.  Watter  loutere  snert,
onsin en bog! Dis die apartheidsregering wat Christelike nasionale  onderwys
... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[It is not true, as the hon Aucamp suggests, that most of the inputs  during
the public hearings were opposed to what the opposition calls the  ``clauses
complained of'' in the Bill. During the hearings we even asked many  of  the
representatives of public and independent schools what  wording  they  would
prefer in some cases.

I  can  specifically  remember  that  the  representatives  of   independent
schools, for example, indicated that they would be satisfied  with  the  use
of the words ``Curriculum Statement'' - and  we  changed  that  accordingly.
Many of the institutions indicated that we should further define  the  issue
of ``assessment'' of the curriculum,  so  that  it  is  clear  that  we  are
dealing here with minimum standards and processes - and we did that.

And allow me to say for the umpteenth time: The Curriculum  Statement  deals
with minimum standards, and the assessing deals with minimum standards.  And
if there are other issues dealt with in  the  curriculum  above  and  beyond
those minimum standards - as  long  as  they  are  in  accordance  with  the
Constitution of the country - that will be allowed. So I do  not  know  what
all the fuss is about.

I also do not know what all the fuss  is  about  around  the  issue  of  the
teaching of values in the curriculum. How can parents be apprehensive  about
the building of  values  of  mutual  respect  for  one  another's  language,
religion and culture in our country?

Hon Aucamp even went so far as to say in the portfolio  committee  that  the
Minister wants to prescribe a specific religion. What absolute rot,  rubbish
and nonsense! It is the  apartheid  government,  with  regard  to  Christian
National education ...]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it in order  for  the  hon
member to make a statement in this House that is not true? That is not  what
I said. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  Aucamp,  that  is  not  a
question for the Chair to be able to pronounce on. Mr Van  den  Heever,  you
may continue. [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

Mnr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Dis die apartheidsregering se beleid wat mnr  Mike
Ellis wat  so  baie  hier  kraai  stilswyend  op  sy  dag  aanvaar  het  wat
Christelik-Nasionale onderwys  in  die  kele  van  almal  wou  afdwing.  Ons
demokratiese regering respekteer dat Suid-Afrikaners 'n  verskeidenheid  van
geloofsoortuigings het en dat die doel van 'n  gesonde  opvoedingstelsel  is
om  respek  vir  die  onderskeie  gelowe  by  ons  kinders  aan  te   kweek.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Die apartheidsregering wou Afrikaans in die  kele  van  leerders  in  Soweto
gaan afdruk het - met rampspoedige gevolge. Ons Regering sê:  Alle  leerders
het die reg tot moedertaalonderrig en dat maniere gevind moet word  om  alle
tale te bemark. Dit is die demokrasie wat die ANC na onderwys en  vir  almal
in ons  land  gebring  het.  [Tyd  verstreke.]  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: It was the apartheid government's policy which  Mr
Mike Ellis, who has so much to say here, silently accepted in his day  which
sought to force Christian National education  down  everyone's  throat.  Our
democratic Government respects the fact that South Africans have  a  variety
of religious convictions and that the purpose of a  sound  education  system
is to  nurture  respect  for  the  various  religions  among  our  children.
[Interjections.]

The apartheid government wanted to  force  Afrikaans  down  the  throats  of
learners in Soweto - with disastrous consequences. Our Government says:  All
learners have a right to mother-tongue education and ways must be  found  to
market all languages. That is the democracy which the  ANC  has  brought  to
education and to everyone in our country. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, I have been in this House for  eight
and a half years, and education seems to  bring  ...  [Interjections.]  Stop
that  starling-type  chattering   there.   Go   to   the   electric   wires.
[Interjections.] No, no, no. I represent a much  more  democratic  voice.  I
have very limited time. I will have to ignore the chattering from here.

Nothing brings out the worst in members quite  like  the  education  debates
do. I regret to say this because there are unarticulated premises  on  which
they operate. They will not articulate the real reasons why they want to  do
this. [Interjections.]

I feel sorry for the hon Ntuli. He says he knows what is happening  that  is
wrong in schools. He knows which governing bodies are not working. He  knows
that black teachers are not employed in Vryburg where 60%  of  the  children
are black. He knows that  in  the  Pretoria  West  school  where  there  are
problems there are no role models for the black children. Let  us  be  quite
frank about  this.  He  knows  what  is  happening.  The  others  stand  for
privilege. [Interjections.] He does not stand for  privilege.  But  then  he
looks schizophrenic. He  is  like  Cervantes'  Don  Quixote.  He  attacks  a
windmill and thinks he is fighting the soldiers there. [Laughter.]

And the hon Boy Geldenhuys is the Sancho Panza in that story. We  will  come
to Sancho Panza in a moment. This is shameful; it is a degrading thing.  The
hon Ntuli knows that this is not a  new  clause,  a  clause  that  says  the
Minister may make regulations ``on any matter  which  may  be  necessary  or
expedient ... to achieve the objects of  this  Act.''  This  is  not  a  new
matter. It is in  the  present  South  African  Schools  Act.  We  are  just
continuing it, because we want a literate - not for lawyers to  determine  -
piece of legislation. But why is there this example of bad faith then?

The hon Dudley does know the Bill, but she quotes  two  extracts  which  are
taken verbatim from the Natal Witness of 23 August.  [Laughter.]  What  does
one do in a situation like that? Verbatim from the  Natal  Witness!  Whoever
wrote her speech? [Interjections.] The DP should know much better that  what
we have done is to meet the situation as it arises.

The hon Ntuli talks about our White Paper, which is our pride and joy.  John
Maynard Keynes said: ``When the facts change, I change my mind.'' The  facts
have changed. We cannot get young people in the  profession.  I  agree  with
the hon Mulder. I will engage with him on a motion we put down. But how  can
we build up the schools system? How can we give better salaries? How can  we
give incentives? That  is  the  kind  of  debate  we  need  in  this  House.
[Applause.]

This farmer from Greytown - what does he know about education, where we  can
grapple with it? That is why there may  have  been  teachers  who  have  for
gotten everything in the meantime. The hon Ntuli then has to really  grapple
with  his  own  situation.  He  is  between  a  rock  and  a   hard   place.
[Interjections.] He has to work it out  and  join  a  party  that  looks  at
liberal humanitarian measures. [Applause.]
In the same way, therefore, I am surprised that  the  hon  Mpontshane  says:
``I will fight to the death for independent schools.'' I would prefer it  if
he fought to the death to improve schooling in KwaZulu-Natal;  to  get  more
classrooms in KwaZulu-Natal; to  ensure  that  teachers  do  their  work  in
KwaZulu-Natal. [Applause.]

We will not give way to the idea expressed in the article in  the  Financial
Mail that we are bringing down  private  schools  to  the  level  of  public
schools. We will not accept that. There are remarkable things  happening  in
state schools. There are remarkable things  happening  in  primary  schools,
not only at the foot of Table Mountain  but  across  the  board.  Remarkable
things are happening in our former Afrikaans ex-Model C schools in terms  of
curriculum development, approach, and our values system.

I am not sure all these schools that we want to take pride in  subscribe  to
the constitutional values of South Africa. I  think  it  is  very  important
that we recognise that change is taking place  in  our  country.  Those  hon
members do not reflect that change. They are fighting ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Oh, rubbish!

The MINISTER: You may say it is rubbish. They  are  seemingly  fighting  for
privileges. [Interjections.]  Real  privileges.  Because  we  must  use  the
assumption of the education system  to  ensure  that  the  education  system
meets the needs of our people. [Interjections.]

Now, I want to say to Mr Geldenhuys that it is quite  true  that  there  are
two parallel systems. At the end of the day if  the  school  governing  body
system does not work, there are the other  systems  we  are  talking  about:
first-time appointments and teachers who have been paid for and  trained  by
a provincial administration. So let us get away from this idea.

He asked me questions here, and questions were asked particularly  by  those
who are chatting to each other, such as: Why do I not do this  and  that  in
the provinces?  I  have  no  power  to  do  so.  That  is  a  constitutional
arrangement. At the same time, he is saying that we are centralising  power.
I am not acquiring any power here. Everything that is being done  about  the
curriculum statement is in the existing legislation. I  cannot  deflect  him
from this. Ignorance has no bounds.

I am sorry that, in fact, the hon Cassie Aucamp has said that  I  must  give
him a guarantee that no one will be appointed  against  the  wishes  of  the
governing body. The governing body is not a stony edifice  that  blocks  all
progress. The governing body must  take  into  account  the  fact  that  the
school system in South Africa has undergone fundamental changes.  If  we  do
not reflect that in the composition of the staff, in  the  associated  staff
there, in the teaching staff, then the state has a right to ensure that  the
constitutional principles are carried out. [Applause.]

We have no choice in the matter. That is why I cannot give  the  hon  Aucamp
that guarantee. If he wants to threaten me with the courts of law,  we  will
see him in court. We are appealing against  the  judgment  in  the  Settlers
Agricultural High School case. We are going to encourage the  appeal  there.
However, the judge did not say that the school governing body  is  the  sole
repository of what is in the best interests of the child.  He  did  not  say
that. We will appeal against that ruling, because we feel public  policy  is
not necessarily determined in the way he set out to do it.

In the same way, I am sorry that the  hon  member  Geldenhuys  is  equivocal
about corporal punishment. He might have been bashed and punished.  We  say,
``What is wrong with you? You might have been a better  person  if  you  had
not been bashed in school.''  [Laughter.]  I  am  quite  clear  about  that.
[Applause.]

So what I am saying, therefore, is that we must cherish all the children  of
the nation equally. This is an attempt to do  so.  This  is  an  attempt  to
remove the obstacles that stop us from cherishing all the  children  of  the
nation equally. [Interjections.] I would like  a  more  responsive  approach
from the parties here so that they are able to understand that, in fact,  we
are not trying to remove choice and privilege. We are not trying to  remove,
ultimately, innovative things. One  must  remember  that  innovative  things
also happen in state schools. A state school system is a public  good.  This
is what we must develop further. This is what  we  must  advance,  and  this
Government is committed to that. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.
