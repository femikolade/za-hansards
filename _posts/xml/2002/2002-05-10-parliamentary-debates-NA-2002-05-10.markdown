                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr F BHENGU: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness the death of Thabang Mbele, a 17-year-old rugby
       player from Potchefstroom Boys High School, as a result of injuries
       sustained while playing in a rugby match;


  (2) notes that this is the latest in a series of fatal and serious
       injuries in rugby, which have claimed the lives of five other boys
       recently and left others maimed;


  (3) recognises these injuries as catastrophic for rugby as a game;


  (4) conveys condolences to the families of Thabang Mbele, Hendrik van der
       Walt, Sisanda Nombekela, Thembisile Nqinekile, Denver Smith,
       Christian Miller and all young rugby-playing boys recently deceased
       as a result of injuries sustained while playing the game; and


  (5) calls on the rugby authorities to implement measures which will
       reduce and eliminate fatal and catastrophic injuries in rugby.
[Applause.]

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the DA has requested the Public Protector to investigate an
           illegal protest that was arranged by the ANC in Frankfort in
           which schoolchildren were enticed from their classrooms to
           bolster the number of protesters outside the courthouse;


       (b)  private and public property was damaged and a child injured
           during this protest;


       (c)  racist hate speech was the order of the day during this protest
           and a follow-up protest by the ANC Youth League two weeks later;
           and ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, you are permitted to use
that placard as a reference, not for permanent display throughout your
motion.

Mr R JANKIELSOHN:


       (d)  ANC MP Dennis Bloem danced with the protestors, many of whom
           should have been in school; and


 (2)  calls on the ANC to accept responsibility for the damage to property,
       the moral corruption of schoolchildren, and the increase of racial
       tension in this community.
[Interjections.]

Here is my reference, which says: ``Die ... boers.'' [Interjections.]
Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) recognises that a huge number of our people are living under extreme
       poverty;


  (2) acknowledges also that there are urgent and desperate calls from the
       labour and NGO movements that the Government should at least give a
       grant of R100 to every unemployed person or poor household to
       alleviate poverty;


  (3) further acknowledges that the Minister of Social Development, Dr
       Skweyiya, respects and understands the tone of these sentiments but
       believes that there is no capacity at the moment to yield to this
       request; and


  (4) hopes and believes that in the foreseeable future there will be some
       social reprieve for the poor people, given such understanding by the
       Minister.

Ms N F MATHIBELA: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Thabo Mbeki was due to start intense talks to
       get the faltering peace process in the war-ravaged Democratic
       Republic of Congo back on track;


  (2) further notes that the Congolese Liberation Movement, the MLC, may
       still join the talks; and


 (3)  commends President Thabo Mbeki and the Government of South Africa for
      their unwavering commitment to seeking a peaceful solution to the
      problems in Congo.
[Applause.]

Mnr J J NIEMANN: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag die volgende gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  van die afbrekende uitspraak wat gemaak is deur 'n werknemer van
           die nasionale Departement van Vervoer, naamlik dat die
           Departement in beginsel nie moet bydra tot enige Afrikaanse
           publikasie nie, want 90% van die mense wat op paaie doodgaan, is
           swart en arm;


       (b)  dat meeste Die Burger-lesers bruin en arm is - toevallig die
           gemeenskap waaruit die Minister self kom - en dat daar nie so
           teen Afrikaanssprekendes gediskrimineer kan word nie; en


       (c)  dat hierdie uitspraak duidelik teenstrydig is met die Regering
           se beleid van eenheid in diversiteit; en


  (2) 'n dringende beroep op die Minister van Vervoer doen om ondersoek in
       te stel na hierdie insident en aan ons die versekering te gee dat die
       betrokkenes nie namens hom of die departement gepraat het nie, want
       Suid-Afrika kan nie bekostig om in twee verskillende klasse verdeel
       te word nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J J NIEMANN: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note -


       (a)  of the destructive remark made by an employee of the national
           Department of Transport, namely that in principle the department
           should not contribute to any Afrikaans publication, because 90%
           of people who die on our road are black and poor;


       (b)  that the majority of Die Burger readers are coloured and poor -
           incidentally the community from which the Minister comes - and
           that we cannot discriminate against Afrikaans speakers in this
           manner; and


       (c)  that this remark is clearly incongruous with the Government's
           policy of unity in diversity; and


  (2) makes an urgent appeal to the Minister of Transport to investigate
       this incident and to give us the assurance that the people involved
       did not speak on behalf of the Minister or the department, because
       South Africa cannot afford to be divided into two different classes.]

Mr D G MKONO: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that yet another outbreak of cholera has occurred in the
       Eastern Cape, affecting the areas of Nqanduli, Umtata and Port St
       Johns;


  (2) supports a decision to declare the affected region a disaster area;
       and


  (3) acknowledges that lack of development and infrastructure lie at the
       heart of the problem, since pollution and inadequate sanitation are
       the direct causes of outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.

Mr V G SMITH: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the United States delayed the issuing of a visa to Mr
       Tokyo Sexwale due to his participation in the armed struggle against
       apartheid;


  (2) believes that this delay suggests that the United States is still
       listing the ANC as a terrorist organisation;


  (3) condemns the delay in issuing Comrade Tokyo Sexwale a passport; and


   (4)      further calls on the US administration to focus on dealing with
       state-sponsored terrorism by the Israeli forces against the unarmed
       civilians, women and children in Palestine.
   [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Health Portfolio Committee held oversight hearings
       into the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act on 7 and 8 May 2002,
       and that these hearings were funded and organised by the Reproductive
       Rights Alliance;


  (2) further notes that although the hearings excluded all pro-life
       doctors, nurses and organisations, the ACDP was not restricted or
       hampered in expressing concern, questioning presenters or responding
       to the accusations of members in spite of the fact that the ACDP
       makes no apology for its conviction that abortion is a tragedy and
       passionately disagrees with the ANC's pro-abortion stance;


  (3) acknowledges that the ACDP cannot take the credit or the blame for
       the silent protest by pro-lifers within the committee room, where
       they sat for two days listening silently as presenter after presenter
       discussed and celebrated the termination of the lives of over 220 000
       unborn babies since the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act was
       enacted five years ago;


   (4)      calls on the Portfolio Committee on Health to give pro-life
      organisations and individuals, especially doctors and nurses, an
      opportunity ...
[Time expired.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with revulsion the bombing and extensive damage this morning to
       the SABC news offices and other personal property in Kimberley,
       Northern Cape;


  (2) repudiates such dastardly conduct in this era;
  (3) calls on the public to lend a hand to the police in their efforts to
       bring these shameless perpetrators to book; and


   (4)      appeals to the SABC members, the public and Zodwa Tlebeyapelo,
       whose vehicles were destroyed in the incident, to remain calm in the
       full knowledge that this also shall pass.
[Applause.]

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Western Cape Department of Health has launched a
       massive campaign to give polio immunisations to at least 90% of the
       province's 425 000 children under the age of five;


  (2) further notes that hundreds of volunteers from technikons and
       communities took to the street this week, spreading the message about
       this immunisation programme;


  (3) commends the Western Cape Department of Health for embarking on this
       campaign; and


   (4)      calls for more volunteers to join the department in the campaign
       for the immunisation of children.
[Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the draft Education Laws Amendment Bill intends removing
       from school governing bodies the right to appoint teachers;


  (2) further notes that school governing bodies are elected by the school
       community, including parents, to look after the best interests of
       their children; and


  (3) therefore calls on the Minister to resist the temptation to further
       centralise power, but to -


       (a)  trust parents to do what is best for their children; and


       (b)  assist parents in this task by fast-tracking the development of
           the management skills of these governing bodies.

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) compliments and commends the Soweto-researched version of a pneumonia
       vaccine to reduce the pneumonia incidence in children living with
       HIV;


  (2) conveys its accolades to the team of scientists both from Wits and
       Emary Universities for coming up with the vaccine; and


  (3) hopes that many young lives will be spared by this medical
       intervention.

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a 39-year-old man from Gonubie in East London was convicted for
           indecently assaulting his 10-year-old stepdaughter in East
           London; and


       (b)  child abuse cases in South Africa are on the increase; and


   (2)      calls on the police and communities to work together to bring
       the perpetrators of this cowardly and barbaric act to book.
   [Applause.]

Mev ANNA VAN WYK: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag die sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis sy hartlike gelukwense oordra aan -


  (1) Media 24 en me Anet Pienaar, Hoof: Feeste, vir die toekenning wat
       hulle ontvang het van Sake en Kunste Suid-Afrika, bekend as BASA, en
       Business Day vir ondernemings wat die kunste ondersteun, met
       spesifieke verwysing na die Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees;


  (2) Kaya-FM, die ander pryswenner in hierdie kategorie; en


     3) al die wenners by SAMA 8 in die verskillende kategorieë van musiek
        vir hul prestasie en hul groot bydrae tot die ekonomie, en veral aan
        die vader van Afrikaanse rock, Anton Goosen, vir sy album Vis innie
        Bos asook vir sy volgehoue bydrae oor 'n lang tydperk om
        oorspronklike inheemse Afrikaanse musiek te bevorder.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House conveys its sincere congratulations to -


  (1) Media 24 and Ms Anet Pienaar, Head: Festivals, on the award they
       received from Business and Arts South Africa, known as BASA, and
       Business Day for ventures in support of the arts, with specific
       reference to the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees;
  (2) Kaya-FM, the other prizewinner in this category; and


  (3) all of the winners in the various categories of music at SAMA 8 on
       their achievement and their big contribution to the economy, and
       especially to the father of Afrikaans rock, Anton Goosen, for his
       album Vis innie Bos as well as his sustained contribution to
       promoting original home-grown Afrikaans music over a long period.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the World Bank has reported that 40 000 of South Africa's
       350 000 teachers have HIV/Aids;


  (2) further notes the unacceptable response to this statistics report by
       the spokesperson for the Minister of Education, who stated that there
       are already numerous programmes in place;


  (3) calls on the Minister of Education to ensure that all the relevant
       key role-players partake in the upcoming Aids convention, to combine
       all resources and to find the best route for the South African
       education sector; and


  (4) calls on Government to be more holistic in its approach to the
       treatment of HIV/Aids.

Mr B J NOBUNGA: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the United Nations World Food Programme has started distributing
           food aid to thousands of severely malnourished people in remote
           areas in Angola; and


       (b)  R534 million is still needed for aid; and


(2)   calls on the people of South Africa and businesses to lend a caring
      hand and to provide material support and other forms of support to the
      Angolan people.
[Applause.]

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, could I address you on a point of order?

Terwyl die mosies hier aangekondig is, het die agb, en baie
onverantwoordelike, lid Bloem in hierdie Raadsaal rondgedans en
intimiderende gebare teenoor die agb Jankielsohn gemaak. Ek dink sy optrede
is onverantwoordelik en onaanvaarbaar. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of
Afrikaans point of order follows.)

[While the motions were being announced here, the hon and very
irresponsible member Bloem was dancing around this Chamber, gesticulating
intimidatingly towards the hon Jankielsohn. I think his actions are
irresponsible and unacceptable. [Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Bloem, can you explain what has
transpired?

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, honestly, I am confused. [Laughter.] I really do
not know what Mr Lee is talking about. I really do not know. He should
explain it. Maybe I will understand. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I want to appeal to hon members to
adhere to the rulings of the Chair. We did rectify the display of a poster
or banner by one of the hon members of the DP. But, I do not think that it
assists us if we then retaliate in unbecoming ways. I therefore want to
appeal to members that we should not condone this kind of behaviour.

                                MOTHER'S DAY
                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move without
notice:

That the House -


     (1)    notes that Sunday, 12 May, is Mother's Day;


     (2)    recognises that the role of motherhood is often undervalued and
         overlooked in society;


     (3)    acknowledges, on behalf of all South Africans, the debt we all
         owe our mothers who have conceived, delivered and nurtured us; and


     (4)    wishes all mothers a very happy Mother's Day and pledges to
         fight for the safety and dignity of all women.

Agreed to.

            INJURED MITCHELLS PLAIN MOTHER AND DEATH OF HER BABY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its distress at the double tragedy of the pregnant woman
       seriously injured by a stray bullet in Mitchells Plain on Wednesday
       night;


  (2) strongly regrets the death of her seven-month-old baby, delivered
       prematurely as she lay in a coma;


  (3) appeals to anyone who might know her identity to come forward to
       assist in finding this woman's family; and


  (4) prays for her full recovery.

Agreed to.

Mr C H F GREYLING: Voorsitter, ek wil nie beswaar maak nie, maar ek wil net
die agb lid daarop wys dat ons 'n reëling het dat daardie tipe mosie voor
die tyd gesirkuleer moet word. Ons het dit nie ontvang nie. [Chairperson, I
do not want to object, but I would like to point out to the hon member that
we have an arrangement that that type of motion be circulated beforehand.
We did not receive it.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Orde! Ons sal vra dat die Swepe daarna kyk.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Could we ask that the Whips would deal with the matter?
[Interjections.]]

        APPOINTMENT OF MR N P NHLEKO AS CHIEF WHIP OF MAJORITY PARTY

                               (Announcement)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I have an announcement
to make. The announcement is that of the appointment of the Chief Whip of
the Majority Party. Mr N P Nhleko has been appointed Chief Whip of the
Majority Party with effect from 9 May 2002. [Applause.]

Mnr T D LEE: Voorsitter, die DA wil mnr Nhleko gelukwens met sy aanstelling
as hoofsweep van die ANC. Ons besef dat hy die vyfde een in 'n baie kort
tydjie is en soos een van ons lede hier agter gevra het: Vir hoe lank? Ek
wil net vir mnr Nhleko sê dat die sukses van hierdie Huis sal afhang van
hoe hy met al die partye hier saamwerk. Ons wil dit graag 'n sukses maak en
ons almal sal hom steun en help. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, the DA would like to congratulate Mr Nhleko on
his appointment as Chief Whip of the ANC. We realise that he is the fifth
person in a very short time and as one of our members sitting here behind
me asked: For how long? I want to tell Mr Nhleko that the success of this
House will depend on how he co-operates with all the parties here. We would
like to make this a success and we will all support and help him.
[Applause.]]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, we, as the IFP, wish to associate
ourselves with the congratulations which have been expressed by my
colleague. We want to offer our co-operation to the newly appointed Chief
Whip of the Majority Party, as we have done with the Chief Whips in the
past and we wish him well. But, we also want to remind him that the
position of Chief Whip of the ANC is an extremely responsible and serious
one. We recommend to him that he should follow in the footsteps of the
other great persons who have acted in this position, people like Mr Arnold
Stofile and others, who made very simple rules. Those rules are that as the
Whippery, we are, in fact, a family. We co-operate not on the basis of
which party one belongs to, but on merit.

We hope that the hon the Chief Whip of the Majority Party will follow that
path and listen to everybody when they have a good case, not because of the
party that they belong to. We are sure that he will do that.

Finally, I also wish to remind him of Rule 72(a)(i), which provides
expressly that when a new Chief Whip of the ANC is elected, within seven
days he must throw a huge party for all members of Parliament. [Laughter.]

Mr C H F GREYLING: Chairperson, on behalf of the New NP, I would like to
congratulate Mr Nhleko on his appointment as the Chief Whip of the Majority
Party. This is a very important and demanding position in Parliament and we
believe that he will do justice to the responsibility that has been placed
on his shoulders.

Die agb lid het die moeilike taak om in die voetspore te volg van gedugte
voorgangers, maar dit is ons oortuiging dat hy in hierdie posisie aangestel
is omdat die meerderheidsparty volle vertroue in hom het om die taak ten
beste te kan verrig. Namens die Nuwe NP wens ek hom sterkte en voorspoed
toe en glo dat hy 'n sukses sal maak van sy taak, asook van hierdie
uitdagende pos, en dat hy te alle tye ewewigtig en regverdig sal optree.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The hon member has the difficult task of following in the footsteps of
formidable predecessors, but it is our conviction that he was appointed to
this position because the majority party has full confidence in him to
perform the task to the best of his ability. On behalf of the New NP I wish
him everything of the best and believe that he will make a success of his
task, as well as of this challenging post - and that he would act in a
level-headed and fair manner at all times.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! It appears that the IFP has not
completed its task yet.

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chairperson, the new Chief Whip has been congratulated
now. Could he just stand up so that we can see who he is? [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! We will give him the opportunity to
do so in a few minutes.
Mr C T FROLICK: Chairperson, the UDM wishes to associate itself with the
sentiments expressed, especially the sentiments articulated by the hon Van
der Merwe. We wish the new Chief Whip everything of the best and we can
assure him of a good working relationship. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Chairperson, the ACDP wishes to congratulate Mr Nhleko
on his appointment as Chief Whip. [Interjections.] We note that he has a
heavy task to perform, but we trust that he will maintain good co-
operation, communication and relations with all the Whips of the various
parties. We would also like to say, as many people have said, that he has a
big task before him as he will be walking in the footsteps of others, but I
would like to encourage him to plot his own course, because he brings his
own flair and dynamism to the office. What we as the ACDP would like to say
is that we will support him, obviously within this particular portfolio,
and we will also give our co-operation at all times.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, the UCDP would like to congratulate Mr
Nkosinathi Nhleko on his appointment. I for one have known him for some
time as chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on the Public Service and
Administration, a position which he held with great dignity and
responsibility. I hope, believe and pray that even in this new assignment
he will continue to conduct himself in that very balanced manner and go on
to execute his duties with the necessary responsibility and dignity. We
congratulate him and assure him that we shall do our best to co-operate
with and support him in all his endeavours. [Applause.] [Laughter.]

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mnr die Voorsitter, die FA wil die agb Hoofsweep
gelukwens. Ons glo hy sal 'n goeie Hoofsweep wees. Ons wil ook iets vir hom
sê. Ons wil hom net daaraan herinner dat die man wat die sweep klap, hom
moet klap en nie gebruik nie. Ons glo hy sal dienooreenkomstig optree.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mr Chairperson, the FA wants to congratulate the hon
Chief Whip. We believe that he will be a good Chief Whip. We also want to
tell him something. We just want to remind him that the man who cracks the
whip, should crack it and not use it. We believe that he will act
accordingly. [Applause.]]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, on behalf of the AEB I congratulate Mr Nkosinathi
Nhleko. [Interjections.] We also give our support to the Chief Whip because
we have a lot in common in the Chief Whip's Forum and in arranging
everything. We hope that he will stay in this job a little while. We wish
him everything of the best.

I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate the New Deputy Chief
Whip.

Ek wil darem net vir mnr Andries Nel ook gelukwens. In 'n tyd wat dit so
sleg gaan daar in Pretoria en met die Blou Bulle wat so verloor het, het hy
weer vir Pretoria op die ``map'' gesit. Baie geluk! [Applous.] [I would
also like to congratulate Mr Andries Nel. In a time that it is going so
poorly there in Pretoria and with the Blue Bulls that keep losing, he put
Pretoria on the map again. Congratulations! [Applause.]]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Mr Chairperson, on behalf of the PAC, I rise to extend our
congratulations to our new Chief Whip. The new Chief Whip's first name,
``Nkosinathi'', means ``the Lord is with us''. I believe that expresses our
sentiments and we hope that, indeed, he will have staying power, but also
steer the course of this House very successfully. We wish him everything of
the best. We are looking forward to very happy times in this House.
[Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, I thought you did not notice me. I also
want to express our heartiest congratulations to Nkosinathi Nhleko. We had
a mother-and-son relationship. I hope he does not forget that.
[Interjections.] I ask him not to forget to send me an SMS, as he always
does when there is a caucus or it is cancelled or whatever. I want to say
congratulations. I think we will all work together to help him and the
Deputy Chief Whip as well. May God bless them. [Applause.]
Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Mr Chairperson, on behalf of Azapo, we wish to
congratulate the comrade. We hope that he will steer the work of this
important job in a manner that will enhance the spirit of comradeship and
co-operation. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Mr Chairperson, earlier I had thought
that in order to be a Chief Whip one had to be bald, like Koos van der
Merwe, Douglas Gibson, or Carl Greyling. That is one disadvantage on my
part. The second thing is that I also thought that a requirement was that
one needed to have lots of grey hair, as had been the case with previous
ANC Chief Whips.

However, I do want to thank all the political parties for their words of
encouragement, and I hope we will be able to conduct our work in the manner
and spirit that has been referred to by a number of political parties here.


We should be driven by only one thing. As Parliament we have a particular
function and role to play, and that role is centred on the oversight
function of Parliament. For that to succeed, it is clearly essential that
parties work together in a co-operative manner and with a common
understanding. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! May I, on behalf of the Presiding
Officers, also add our voice, and congratulate you, Mr Nhleko, on your
appointment and assure you of our support in the new role that you will be
playing.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 33 - Water Affairs and Forestry:

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Chairperson, it has been a most
interesting morning so far. Pula nala le kgotso. [Let there be peace and
prosperity.]

From the rain comes the greenery of development and growth that provides
peace. Given that it is Mothering Sunday this Sunday, may I dedicate this
speech to amakhosikazi namanzi - the women of this country - who play such
a crucial role in the water sector.

We are told that Joseph of biblical times came to the Pharaoh's notice when
he interpreted his dreams and warned that seven fat years would be followed
by seven lean years. I am not claiming to be a Pharoah or a prophet, but
let me say that when the dams are full, as they are now, and the land is
fat, as it is, is when we should begin to prepare for the inevitable
drought that will follow, for ours is a water-stressed country with varied
rainfall.

As the farmers say: ``If the floods do not get you, then the drought
will.'' And we see this to the north, in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique,
at the moment. We have learnt some lessons from our history, and we know
better than to eat our corn seed.

In so far as it is possible to prepare, we are prepared for the
uncertainties that nature may bring. And in this year of sustainable
development our preparedness has been recognised. Inside South Africa we
can already claim a major breakthrough in the preparations for the
Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development. This breakthrough is
the fact that it is internationally accepted that the key sustainability
challenge confronting us as a world community is poverty.

It is acknowledged that the main barriers to achieving a world in which the
next generation's inheritance is as good as its predecessor's are not - and
South Africa has led in this - environmental alone, but also social and
political. All that is needed is for us to link the political, the social
and the environment. If we tackle the challenges of poverty and
underdevelopment, the environmental challenges become manageable.

One reason South Africa's arguments carry weight in this international
debate is that we are talking from practical experience. This Government of
delivery is not just committed to the ideal of sustainable development, we
are implementing it. We have shown that it is possible to provide all South
Africans with access to basic water and sanitation, within the framework of
sustainable development.

Many countries talk about the importance of recognising this as a basic
human right. We are doing just that. We are demonstrating that we can
protect the environment and meet all our people's basic water needs, for
which we need - and hon members should listen to the figure - only 1,5% of
our nation's available water resources. That is in the nature of three
billion cubic metres of water per annum - three billion of an annual volume
of run-off of 50 billion. This is a very good estimate we have made. This
has already been reserved, in terms of our National Water Act, and we have
made a great start in providing safe, hygienic, environmentally acceptable
sanitation. It is demonstrably within our means to ensure a healthy
environment for all our people.

Between 1994 - the year of the great democratic change - and April this
year, my department has spent well over R5,2 billion providing water supply
infrastructure to 7,2 million of our people. Some of the beneficiaries are
in the gallery here today. I would like to acknowledge Mrs Langa-Chuene,
who was the three-millionth person to receive clean water from our
Government programme. She is from Mpumalanga. [Applause.] Malibongwe!
[Praise!]

And I would like to acknowledge our latest seven-millionth recipient from
the rural areas around Port St. Johns, Mrs Ntuthuma. She is our seven-
millionth recipient of clean water. [Applause.] I would also like to point
out that we have a very unique group here from the Msinga area of KwaZulu-
Natal. Mrs Mzila and Mr Dlamini are from a community that did not wait for
the water service, but got involved with Mvula in a partnership and they
organised a community water service for themselves. And for that they won
the Water Institute of Southern Africa Award this last year. I greet them
as well. [Applause.]

We are continuing in this Government and this department to deliver. We
will reach that target of 14 million who were without clean water in 1994.
We are on our way to the eight-millionth. We will reach it this year and in
seven years' time we will wipe out that dreadful apartheid legacy.
[Applause.]

This year we have allocated from my budget a further R888 million for water
supply, just on R160 million for sanitation, and a further R200 million for
water and sanitation delivery from international donors, who understand
that this is a Government and a department they can feel confident in and
so they continue to provide us annually with very large donor sums. Amanzi
ayimpilo. [Water is life.] And sanitation is not a dirty word. Sanitation
is dignity and I am quite happy to be remembered as a Minister of
sanitation.

We have borrowed a wonderful phrase from Rand Water, one of our family of
water boards, ``izandla ziyagezana''. [The one hand washes the other.]
[Applause.] And we stress this in terms of our drive to ensure that our
people are healthy. ``Izandla ziyagezana'' also demonstrates the strength
of partnership. We can see this from the wonderful gallery today filled
with water and forestry sector partners of the department and Government,
partners of our communities, and I thank them for being here with us.

At this rate of spending we will wipe out the infrastructure backlog of not
only clean water by 2008, but, with this programme of sanitation, we will
wipe out the sanitation backlog - as long as the money continues to roll in
- by the year 2010. This is a tremendous achievement in anybody's language,
by a Government that is eradicating poverty and building a better life for
all our people, a Government that is delivering on a massive scale. We are
pushing back the frontiers of poverty. Our policy of free basic water is
ensuring that once we provide the infrastructure everywhere, everyone in
this country, ``in hierdie land'' [in this country] will be served with
free basic water ``jikele'' [throughout] Afrika Borwa. [South Africa.]
[Applause.]

Already more than 26 million, 66% of the total served by water
infrastructure, live in areas where free basic water is being provided, and
those numbers are rising. On 1 July, the start of local government's
financial year, another 24 more local authorities will begin implementing
this policy, and that will benefit another 3 million of our people with
clean basic water. The outstanding 70 municipalities still to introduce
free basic water are being targeted with the support they need to ensure
that they can also provide free water. With this policy we have completed
the foundation to ensure that the constitutional right of access to basic
water supply and safe sanitation can be met, and met on a sustainable
basis.

Sustainable water and sanitation are about more than meeting basic needs.
They are also about economic development and ensuring water services for
our people, economy, nation, commerce, industry, agriculture and mining.
They are needed to keep the economy growing. ``Amanzi ayimpilo''. [Water is
life.] It is for our health and that of our economy.

The point I want to dwell on today is that to provide a reliable water
service, we have to have reliable sources of water. We as a nation must
ensure that we have enough water in our rivers and aquifers, the hidden
treasures below ground, and that those sources are fit to use and are not
polluted.

Earlier this year I had the pleasure to inaugurate the Inyaka Dam near
Bushbuckridge. The water that dam stores will ensure that never again will
millions of people in the regions of Mpumalanga and Limpopo suffer the
absolute shortages that they faced during the 1991-2 drought. We must
ensure that we meet the needs of other users such as farmers and large
industries. There should be water to cool the power stations of Eskom that
drive our economy and produce the wealth required to build the economy and
ensure a better life for our people.

But, dam building is not the only way to achieve the goal of water
security, as important as it is. I will return to this. There are other
instruments at our disposal and we must choose and use them well. It used
to be said that South Africa would run out of water by the year 2030. This
frightened us out of our wits. It was said that we would fight each other
over the last glass of clean water. These were greatly exaggerated
statements from the past. It is not true. We have more than enough water to
build the society of all our dreams and to meet the needs of all. This does
not mean that we have an abundance of ``metsi'' or ``amanzi''. [Water.] We
cannot sit back and do nothing. On the contrary, we have enough water,
because we have the political will and professional skill to make the most
of what is available, even though we have relatively little water per
person compared to many other countries. We are indeed a water-stressed
country.

Why am I sounding so confident? The basis of my optimism and my assertion
that there is enough water for us to live, grow and thrive, is the national
water resource strategy that we will be publishing in July this year for
public comment. The national water strategy is South Africa's blueprint for
survival. This term was coined by Edward Goldsmith, pioneer of sustainable
development. It is the product of four years of intensive work since the
passing of the National Water Act in 1998. The national water strategy sets
out strategies, plans and procedures to achieve these aims. It is a
remarkable and ambitious document, the first of its kind, not only in South
Africa but one of the first in ``die hele wêreld''. [The whole world.]

The strategy addresses how we will protect our water, allocate the right to
use it - not the way it was allocated in the past - develop it and manage
it. This is the instrument provided by our National Water Act, which has
now come to the Statute Book and goes down to the fields, mines, power
stations and municipalities.

Some of our critics claim that we are moving too slowly. They need to come
down from their ivory towers and find out what is happening on the ground,
engage with Government, work with us and jointly work out how we, as a
nation, can work better, because we always have to find out how to do it
better. Economists Bate and Tren complain in their book The Cost of Free
Water, published by, guess, the Free Market Foundation, that:


  It seems apparent that while the admirable goals of social equity,
  ecological and financial sustainability remain, the proposals are caught
  up in bureaucratic machinery with little prospect of having any impact in
  the short or medium term.

What a laugh! They must check what is being done and the time that we are
taking for implementing a policy like this. They must check what the rich
world is doing. The European Union's Water Framework Directive covers
similar areas as our water strategy. It estimates that it would take six
years to prepare the draft catchment plans, eight years to initiate water
pricing, ten years to implement and 25 years before good water status is
achieved throughout Europe.

``Kyk na hierdie land''! [Look at this country!] In 1994, democracy at
last, in 1998, our new Water Act, and four years later we have our
blueprint for development! And that is South Africa, that is democracy and
that is this Government. [Applause.] When one compares our progress with
Europe's proposed timetable, one can see that our actual pace of
implementation has in some areas exceeded the European targets. I can tell
hon members that already more than 46 000 water users have been registered.
These users account for about 90% of the country's water use. Those water
users I refer to are not hon members and me; they are mine owners,
industrialists, big agriculture and irrigation farmers. We are registering
and licensing them. They account for 90% of the water use, and 689 new
licences have been issued.

In case there are water users who think that because they are far away from
Pretoria they will be able to escape the new laws, I must say to them, bad
luck. We did not have to send Mark Shuttleworth into space for us. This
department and Government are already using satellite images dating back to
1998, and the implementation of the National Water Act, so that when a Mrs
Fletcher of Tosca in the far Northern Cape complained to me that boreholes
on her farm were being dried up by neighbours who had started to irrigate
new fields, I was able to reassure her. We know that those limestone
caverns she relies on can provide a secure, reliable source of water if we
are not greedy, but if too much water is taken out they simply dry up, and
we will not allow that to happen.

I give notice here to all those who seek to stake a claim as existing users
of water by unreasonable expansion of irrigation in dry areas where there
is simply not enough water, that they are wasting their time and money. Eye-
in-the-sky technology is keeping track of them and our satellite images
will very quickly prove who is using water lawfully and who is taking a
chance with the law.

I hope I have assured hon members that our Government has already put in
place much of the administrative machinery we need in order to manage our
nation's water use. Part of the costs of implementing the National Water
Act will come from new revenues, we estimate about R50 million, which we
will be collecting in terms of the national water pricing policy.
Before my radical critics rise up in protest and allege that I am
privatising water, let me emphasise that we are doing the opposite. We are
ensuring that water is used in the public interest. With this system, we
are moving further away from the situation where people who owned land in
the past could claim the right to whatever flowed past them, and used
however much they wanted to, regardless of the unfortunates out of sight
and away from the river.

The apartheid riparian practices are dead, buried and gone forever.
[Applause.] Since 1998 our water has been managed for the benefit of all.
But, of course, and this is the reality, it costs money to manage water
well and it is only right that those who use most should pay most. So, I
must praise Thekwini and Msunduzi municipalities for reaching agreement
with Umgeni Water, under the leadership of the new CEO, Gugu Moloi, who is
here with chairman Omar Latiff and others, in accepting responsibility for
rural communities in their areas and settling their tariff dispute. This
has enabled Umgeni to ensure that this year's tariff increases will be kept
to within a percent of inflation, and already their credit rating, the cost
of their money, has improved.

I would also like to celebrate the agreement reached between Rand Water and
the Chamber of Mines. I see the chairperson, Phiroshaw Camay, and others
from Rand Water here. The agreement they have reached with the Chamber of
Mines is that the mines will no longer enjoy the preferential tariffs of
the past, paying less for their water than the poor around them. I am
delighted to see the industry accepting its responsibilities to our broader
society.

Similarly, the new water resource management charges levied from 1 April
will not affect rural households that are simply growing a few vegetables
in their vegetable gardens or providing water for some grazing cattle and
goats. It affects the mines, the large industries, the municipalities,
local government and those farmers who are responsible for using more than
51% of the nation's water, which goes to irrigation farming, as well as
ensuring that those who benefit from dams and other large waterworks pay
for the privilege. Water pricing will fund the agencies responsible for
monitoring water use, implementing programmes of water conservation and
infrastructure construction to ensure that our development is not
unjustifiably constrained.

I want to salute the forestry industry - I see Mike Edwards of Forestry SA
and others are here with us - for two important steps. Firstly, they have
recognised the importance of managing water and are supporting the
registering of plantation forestry as a water use, one form of stream flow
reduction activity of which more and more are under examination. They know
that environmental protection brings commercial benefits since they have to
show the world market that they manage their plantations in a sustainable
way, as the Sappis and the Mondis are now doing.

Secondly, in order to make the system work more effectively, they are
discussing how they can assist us to collect the water management charges
that will be levied against their very thirsty business. We need to build
this kind of co-operative arrangement to ensure that we support this
industry, whether by improving our administrative efficiency or by working
with my colleague, the Minister of Transport, to help keep their transport
costs under control.

This Government regards forestry as a vital component of effective rural
development. This past year has seen substantial progress in restructuring
state forests, those of the former homelands run by my department and those
of Safcol. The process of leasing the large forests is now virtually
complete. There has been real black empowerment and very tangible community
benefits in the form of rentals for land used and shares in the forest
company themselves. I want to pay credit to my Chief Director: Forestry,
Lael Bethlehem, and her team for the tremendous work they have done.
[Applause.]

This Government knows that job creation is one of the greatest challenges
we face, that we are going to be measured by our achievements in this
field. There are encouraging developments in the forestry sector.

A small KwaZulu-Natal company which collected the sap from pine trees,
which is processed to make special chemicals, ran into financial trouble.
When my director of commercial forestry learned of this, he encouraged
another company to get into the business. The firm wrote to us to say that
at the time the previous firm ceased to trade 250 people were employed and
were harvesting 100 000 kg of resin a month and now:

    ``We now employ five times the number and harvest five times the
    amount. We are continuing to expand and hope to have a resin processing
    factory by January next year, which will create another 28 positions.
    We feel you should be aware that your input into this industry has
    directly created 315 jobs, with the potential for another 350.
[Applause.]

Opportunities are there to be found, and I have given a small example of
this. I believe there is scope to afforest a further 100 000 hectares in
the Eastern Cape, which is not being done because of the complications of
using communally held land. The example of Singisi Forest products should,
over the next few years, lead to a new partnership between communities and
their traditional leaders, forest companies, provinces and so on, and
create more jobs.

There are several women in the gallery today from the agricultural sector.
I am referring to Susan Richards, Cynthia Coopman and others from the
Western Cape. At Lotto near Vredendal there is a cedar-cypress venture
where access to water allocation has given women farmers - and there are
about a dozen with us today - opportunities to engage in commercial farming
which they never had before. I salute them.

Our efforts are not limited to South Africa. Following the President's call
to make this the African century, we have focused attention on this
continent and at international forums. At the Second World Water Forum in
the Hague, representatives of our water sector played a major role in
formulating a vision for action. Our participation in the Bonn
International Freshwater Conference contributed to the formulation of the
position on water and sanitation for the Earth Summit.

What was once a heresy, the free basic water programme that we have
introduced, and which was opposed by the world's institutions the World
Bank and others, is now recognised as a legitimate way to proceed in
circumstances such as ours. The Nepad agenda has been strongly promoted and
African water task forces focused on ways in which water could help to
eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development in Africa. This
position was carried forward just last week to the African Ministerial
Conference on Water, held in Abuja, Nigeria, which I attended. At this
conference we agreed on an African position on water and sanitation that
will see us Africans speaking with one voice as Africans at the World
Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.

At the summit, one of the major supporting events will be a massive
exhibition and programme of presentations, debates and so on for the week -
the World Water Dome. During the week, progress made on the framework of
action will be reviewed and actions identified to bridge gaps between
commitment, delivery and goals.

I personally sought opportunities to discuss the summit and how water and
sanitation link the broader development agenda with Ministers from
developed and developing countries from all over the world, and we have
made tremendous progress in reaching a common approach.

As I said at the beginning, our influence on sustainable development debate
comes from the fact that we are doing things, and not just talking. We are
engaged in a range of initiatives designed in part to ensure our water
security as a region. The Maguga Dam in Swaziland was opened a few months
ago by King Mswati III and Deputy President Zuma. This joint project on
shared rivers will create 18 000 jobs on the citrus and sugar farms of
Swaziland, as well as opportunities for 1 100 emergent black farmers in
South Africa.

Just a few days ago in Swaziland I met my counterparts from Swaziland and
Mozambique to finalise the shared river agreement that, when ratified, will
establish a systematic basis for further co-operation.

The Lesotho Highlands Water Project is progressing well. In October 2001
the Matsoka Diversion Weir and tunnel were commissioned and the
construction of the Mohale Dam is now substantially complete. The contracts
for the Matsoka Diversion and the Mohale Dam were completed within the
original budget, and the flow of water through the Mohale tunnel is
expected to commence at the beginning of January 2004. I notice
representatives from the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority here, as well as
the CEO, Martie van Rensburg. I greet her and commend her for what has been
achieved by the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority.

The National Water Resource Strategy outlines the future requirements of
water for different regions of the country. But I can tell hon members now
that the completion of this project means that the water supply for the
industrial heartland of our region has been secured for at least a decade
and more, and we have many more options to develop and ensure
sustainability as our needs arise. We will do so by managing our water, and
by developing infrastructure where appropriate.

As we face the challenges of climate change, I am struck by how poor Africa
is with regard to the collection and storage of water. Figures I have
recently looked at and studied, from the World Bank no less - which has
opposed the development of more dams - are a real eye-opener. Hon members
must understand the difference between the rich and the poor, the developed
and the developing countries. We understand that through GDPs, life
expectancy, infant mortality, etc.
Listen to the statistics. In the United States they store in their dams and
reservoirs over 6 000 cubic metres of water per capita, in other words, for
every person there is 6 000 cubic metres in reserve. In our country,
leading in Africa, we store 746 cubic metres, about a tenth of that of the
United States. But in the rest of Africa it is a hundredth of that of the
United States. Ethiopia, for instance, can only store 40 cubic metres, and
Kenya only four cubic metres. Our climate is more uncertain, justifying
more and not less storage.

Despite this self-evident fact we still have the anti-dam lobbyists and
brigade opposing projects such as the new dam on the Berg River, which will
secure Cape Town's economic and social development. I am very pleased to
see the hon Graham McIntosh's letter in the Cape Times this morning,
supporting the building of this dam.

I have been lucky to date. I am being regarded as the ``Minister of Good
Rains''. However, we cannot rely on luck. Our people understand the issues.
They know that we should not be seduced by the good years. We must put
aside enough water and food, as the Pharaoh of Joseph did, during rainy
days and good periods, to use during poverty and drought.

So, while we focus on delivering clean water and adequate sanitation to our
people, we also develop and manage our water and forestry resources in a
sustainable way to secure the wellbeing of our economy and people for all
time to come.

This is a responsible government, a government of delivery, a government
which is building a better life for our people and a government which
believes in partnerships. I see in the gallery Trevor Field of Roundabout
Play Pumps, who, together with the private sector and my assistance, has
managed to attract funds for 240 of these magical play pumps at R45 000 a
piece, so that schoolchildren at play at schools in the poor rural areas
are able to pump up the water, through expending their energy on the play
pump, for storage in a water tank which bears an HIV/Aids message.
[Applause.] This is a wonderful portfolio and attracts dedicated people.

My thanks go to the chairperson of the portfolio committee, Comrade Buyelwa
Sonjica, and maLydia Ngwenya, two of our recently recognised ``Amakhosikazi
Namanzi'' [Women in Water] on whom I had the pleasure to confer our new
Women in Water Awards recently. Malibongwe! [Applause.] To all members of
the portfolio committee, my thanks.

Finally, let me express my appreciation to Guy Preston of Working for Water
and our Working for Water teams that I spoke about in the NCOP yesterday,
to my director general, Mike Muller, who has led the department which
delivers and will continue to deliver. They have a tremendous job and
deserve our nation's gratitude.

I would like particularly to pay tribute to Dr Paul Roberts, our outgoing
Deputy Director-General for Water Resources, who has been with this
department and Government for 42 years, who helped to develop and build
those wonderful structures that ensure that we do indeed have the water
available in a sustainable way. [Applause.]

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Mr Chairman, one has to get up early in the morning to
catch Minister Ronnie Kasrils out, and obviously if one has 45 minutes
where I only have eight, and one has some taxpayers' money to fly people
into the gallery, one has certain marketing advantages which the official
Opposition does not have.

What is the role of the official Opposition? The official Opposition ...
uma sesikhuluma isiZulu, umsebenzi weqembu eliphikisayo ufana nowomkhwekazi
emndenini. [... in Zulu we say the work of the opposition party is the same
as the work of a mother-in-law in her daughter's family.] The mother-in-law
in a family is not always popular, she makes people learn certain ways of
doing things, but she is there to build the family, not to break it down.

One of the small but really exciting successes in South African
privatisation has been the Ntsingisi Forest, which has been in operation
for about eight or ten months, preceded by a very long process of
negotiation. Previously these forests were costing the taxpayer around R200
million cash a year in the former Transkei. After eight months it is
breaking even, there are successful community projects and emerging
contractors have created 120 new jobs for the poorest and least skilled of
our people.

There is one important question, and the Minister must answer this, because
if he wants to expand into community forestry, he needs to tell us this:
Where has the R9 million in rentals gone that have been paid. Has it gone
to the communities or has it not?

The Minister must not worry about the radical critics of privatisation. We
have had apartheid and we have had communism. Thank God they are in the
past. He must turn his back on the communist critics of privatisation.
[Applause.]

Nelspruit and Dolphin Coast are two obvious examples of where privatisation
has been extremely successful. In Nelspruit there is a problem of
nonpayment which is also organised. Privatisation of water services can
release literally billions of rands and also in many cases provide real
opportunities for delivery to our people. We have passed regulations in
terms of section 19(5) of the Water Services Act which will protect the
public interest in privatisation. But what we need is that there should be
a small and independent regulatory body, established by an Act of
Parliament that is well-funded and staffed by people skilled in special
areas. [Interjections.]

The Rand Water Board could be privatised. The Trans-Caledon Tunnel
Authority has a R25 billion mandate from the Treasury. It is already
advising Umgeni Water, and is also acting as a site agent for the Skuifraam
Dam, another example of a unit that could be privatised. Clearly, the
process has to be approached very carefully, but I believe there is an
opportunity for unlocking huge potential for South Africa.

The annual report of the department is a fine achievement by the Director-
General and his team. It is concise and conforms to the new best practice
in law and in financial reporting.
The new local government dispensation which has come will now give the
department the opportunity and huge challenge, both financial and
technical, of handing over 334 water schemes of various kinds to local
government.

I trust that the Minister will ensure that he makes good use of all the
skills and capacity available in our rainbow nation, without racial and
gender discrimination, so as to provide a full service and opportunities to
all our people, without exception.

Hon members may not know this, but the Lesotho Highlands Water Project is
the largest water supply project in the world. The report notes, as the
Minister has said, that phase 1 of the R17 billion project is due for
completion, although unfortunately - the Minister did not say this - the
Mohale Tunnel has been delayed. It should have been finished this year.
What is important is that it is economically sustainable. It is paid for by
South African taxpayers and has given a huge boost to Lesotho.

What is worrying is the following, and this is going to be a key issue. The
Minister should be aware of this at the Johannesburg World Summit. Members
who have visited the area would have noticed extensive cultivation on
extremely steep slopes of friable, fragile, volcanic soil, severe erosion
and inevitable silting. In terms of international agreements, Lesotho is
obliged to prevent this type of desertification. The Minister should tell
us whether he has spoken to his colleagues in Lesotho, and also whether his
department has had a look at the Drakensberg catchment in the Bergville
area, where there is also severe desertification. [Interjections.]

I am pleased that the Minister has dealt with that, but according to the
annual report we are still not having our protocols approved in terms of
agreements wih SADC, and the arrangements with Namibia on the Orange River
are dragging. How, this House is entitled to ask, can Nepad mean anything
if we cannot even get our SADC agreements sorted out?

The Minister must also tell us what has happened at Dukuduku. Has it been
finalised? Have the settlers been moved out of those forests and what is
the Minister doing about it?

The water boards appear to have problems. The buck in respect of all the
water boards stops on the Minister's desk. Almost all the department's
problems with these water boards stem from the former Bantustans. The
Bushbuckridge Water Board is a joke and ethnicity is a complicating factor.


The forestry mess, which we have almost sorted out, to the credit of the
department once again, was a legacy of the Bantustans. Two of the examples
of challenges of water services are the Rand Water Board and Umngeni Water
Board. The one had only industrial, urban and mining uses and never made
use of state money; the other had urban uses, but took on rural water
supply and then was forced by Minister Asmal to take on even more rural
supply schemes. Now, as the Minister said, it sits with a huge debt.
Government has had to bail them out with R120 million. I do not want to go
into the details; it is all there in stark financial horror in the annual
report. Why does he allow the Umngeni Water Board to gallivant around the
world trying to sell expertise when it cannot even manage its own backyard
properly? [Interjections.]

Rural water supplies require skilful funding. We forgive enthusiasts a lot,
but the Minister must be careful before he promises everybody in South
Africa clean potable water and sanitation by 2010. He may, of course, not
be in power then. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Nksz B P SONJICA: Mhlalingaphambili, akudingeki ukuba ndiqale ngokuphedula
obu buvuvu bugqiba kuthethwa nguMnu McIntosh. Icacile into eyayihlelelwe
nguMnu McIntosh iminyaka elishumi elinesihlanu kule Palamente. Wayehlelele
ukuxhasa ingcinezelo eyayigquba ngaphambili kweli. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

Njengokuba ethetha kangaka ngombandela wokuthengiswa kwamashishini
kaRhulumente, akathethi egameni labantu abahluphekileyo, uthetha egameni
labaxhasi bakhe kuba ... (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Ms B P SONJICA: Chairperson, it is not necessary for me to first respond
to this nonsense that has just been said by Mr McIntosh. What Mr McIntosh
had stayed in this Parliament for for 15 years is very clear. He remained
here to support and encourage the oppression that people were subjected to
in this country. [Applause.]

He speaks about privatisation as though he is speaking for the poor people.
He is not. He is speaking for his supporters, because ...]

... it is his constituency that is going to benefit from privatisation.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I wonder why the
interpreting service is not on. The speakers' list clearly indicates that
the member is going to be speaking in isiXhosa.

Ms B P SONJICA: Chairperson, he is speaking for his constituency. He is
promoting the interests of his constituency. That is the hypocrisy of the
DA. [Interjections.]

Let me take this opportunity to congratulate the Department of Water
Affairs and Forestry on the global energy award that it received in 2002 in
Austria. This award was in recognition of its role in the delivery of water
services to the rural and the urban poor.

Nezizwe zaphesheya ziyamngqina uRhulumente we-ANC okokuba nguRhulumente
wabantu. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [Even foreign countries recognize and acknowledge
the fact that the ANC Government is the Government of the people.
[Applause.]]

The ANC will participate in this Budget Vote under the theme ``Water and
Forests for Poverty Alleviation and Development'', because we acknowledge
the Government's and the department's central role in development and
poverty alleviation. We welcome the growth from R452 million in the 2002-03
budget to R519 million for 2003-04. The department will also benefit from
the allocations of the Department of Local Government, especially under the
Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme. It will also benefit from
other departments such as Housing, because it shares a number of functions
with these departments.

Clearly our Government, through this allocation, has displayed an
understanding of the significance of investment in water for socioeconomic
development, and an understanding of the broad development path in the
water sector. The expenditure trends indicate that the Department of Water
Affairs, for the past two years, has been meeting a target of plus-minus a
million people per annum for water supply. That is quite an impressive
performance. However, there are also indications that more needs to be done
to avoid underspending by the department. We are aware that underspending
is mainly the result of limited capacity at local government level. We also
know that some of these institutions are newly established.
We welcome the establishment of a task team that will bring together the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry and the Department of Local
Government for the purpose of capacity-building. Otherwise the provision of
much-needed services will be delayed.

We also need to strengthen our systems at local government and provincial
levels. Municipalities need to use the local planning forum and the
provincial planning forum, which facilitate meetings between the Department
of Water Affairs and local councils at regional level for budgeting and
prioritisation. We would appreciate it if the department could continue to
improve its debt management and auditing system, as it promised at the
Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts hearing.

There are still problems regarding the manner in which the equitable share
is managed. We probably need to explore the possibility of making a
percentage of the share conditional so that the payment of services for the
poor is always guaranteed.
With regard to Foresty, we want to urge the Minister to continue to monitor
the black economic empowerment companies, and to nurture them until they
are strong enough to stand on their own.

Siyavuya kakhulu ukuva okokuba la mahlathi, ngakumbi lawa akwaSingaLanga
nakwaSingisi, sele eze namathuba emisebenzi akumawaka amabini. Siyayivuyela
loo nto. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [We are glad to hear that these forests, especially
those at Singalanga and Singisi, have opened up approximately two thousand
job opportunities. We welcome that. [Applause.]]

The portfolio committee, being concerned about the public debate on the
Nelspruit concession, visited Mpumalanga, because we in the ANC have a
hands-on approach. We met with all the stakeholders - the council, the
trade union and the company, Biwater.

We were encouraged to learn that problems that existed had to a great
extent been resolved. However, private sector participation in the
provision and supply of water can be viable only for certain communities.
It would be prudent for the department to encourage public-public
partnerships when necessary. [Applause.]

There appears to be inconsistency in the policy for the development of
infrastructure and water schemes under Programme 2, where there is an
allocation that will be utilised for information to support the planning
and development of infrastructure and the assessment of the viability of
water schemes.

Programme 3 deviates from designing new water supply schemes to maintaining
existing schemes. If my interpretation is correct, the implication is that
the people who have lived in underdeveloped areas will continue to be
underserved, which is a contradiction of government's commitment to
redress, and poverty alleviation. Most importantly, they will be denied
their basic rights, that is, access to clean water. Also, in a broader
sense, development will be delayed in those areas.

An example of what I have spoken about was observed in Mogalakwena,
Limpopo. This municipality needs water for socioeconomic development. We
request the Minister to look into following the Lesotho Maguga-Nkomati
approach, that of creating a special-purpose vehicle like the Trans-Caledon
Tunnel Authority, to raise funding for the construction of the Rooipoort
Dam. If that project could succeed, the mines would be able to expand and
create the much-needed jobs in that area. The surrounding villages would
also benefit from the supply of water. Tourism would also flourish in that
area. But at this stage I want to commend the department for a very
comprehensive dam construction programme, which includes our binational
projects in Lesotho, Nkomati, and so on.

Thina sileli Sebe leMicimbi yaManzi naMahlathi sesiyiqalisile iNepad kuba
ezi projekti ziphucule intlalo yabantu zavula amathuba emisebenzi zaqinisa
ubudlelwane phakathi kwethu nezinye izizwe ezingabamelwane. [Kwaqhwatywa.]
[We, as this Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, have already started
with Nepad because these projects have improved people's lives by availing
job opportunities, thereby strengthening relations between us and the
neighbouring countries. [Applause.]]

The Accra Convention on Water and Sustainable Development says that water-
based initiatives must link with broader efforts to promote sustainable
development in Africa. It further calls for co-operation in Africa to
improve economic conditions. We would encourage that co-operation between
the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry and various departments -
Social Development, Health, Land Affairs and Agriculture - so that they
consolidate their poverty alleviation and development programme to make a
greater impact on poverty.

Sifuna ukubona abantu bephuculwa kukuziswa kwamanzi kwiindawo zabo abahlala
kuzo, belima iigadi, bengawo namafama asakhasayo. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

Mandimphendule ke ngoku uMnu McIntosh kuba le ngxoxo yakhe iqala ephepheni
eliyiMail & Guardian apho athethe khona ubuvuvu esithi ikholera ibangelwe
kukuba uRhulumente we-ANC ecothile ukuzisa iinkonzo ebantwini.

ILUNGU ELIHLONIPHEKILELO: Uyahlanya!

Nksz B P SONJICA: Senditshilo ndathi uhleli iminyaka eli-15 engakhange enze
nto apha. Into awayeyenza wayekhankasela ingcinezelo, ngoba ukuba
wayengakhankaseli ingcinezelo ngesingakhange saqalisa kwa ukusilela oko
kwiinkonzo zococeko. Sifumana ukusilela nje yinto yokuba bona bashiye obo
buvuvu ngasemva.  (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[We want to see people's lives improving in their communities, starting up
gardens, as well as being emerging farmers. [Applause.]

I would now like to respond to Mr McIntosh's nonsensical argument that
appeared in the Mail & Guardian, in which he says that cholera was caused
by the fact that the ANC Government delayed its process of providing
services to the people.]

An hon MEMBER: He is mad!

[Ms B P SONJICA: I have already said that he remained here for 15 years
without doing anything. All he did was to campaign for oppression, because
if did not campaign for oppression we would not be this far behind with
cleansing services. We are behind because they left that legacy.]

While we support the need to improve performance, we hope that the
restructuring of the Working for Water programme will maintain its image
because to the portfolio committee this is a flagship programme of the
department.

In conclusion, the ANC supports this Budget Vote. We commend our Government
for understanding that government is a trust and that the members are
trustees, and that both the trust and the trustees are created for the
benefit of the people. [Applause.]

Mr M S M SIBIYA: Chairperson, hon Minister, it is encouraging to see that
there has been an overall increase of R40 million in the allocation of the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, despite three of the eight
programmes showing decreases in their allocation from the 2001-02 budget.
It is particularly pleasing to see that the allocation to the
implementation of water services projects, a subprogramme of the Regional
Implementation programme, which accounts for about 68% of the total
expenditure over the medium term, increases by R226,89 million. Only six of
the twelve subprogrammes in the regional implementation programme received
increases in their allocations.

The work of the department directly effects the everyday lives of millions
of South Africans, but it has an even greater effect on the lives of the
rural and poor people of South Africa. Many of them still go to rivers and
forests to fetch the water and firewood that are so essential to the
everyday running of their households. In most cases it is the women who
have to walk long distances every day to fetch the water and wood. This is
not only a burden to them but it is also dangerous.

The department must be commended for the outstanding work that it has done,
to date, in providing clean, safe water and services to the people of South
Africa. According to the Minister, by 2008 the entire backlog of people
without access to clean, safe water should be wiped out if the current rate
of progress is maintained.

At this stage the department is making good progress in its efforts to
provide free basic water to the people, yet it must not stop here. The poor
people in the rural areas are still waiting for the promised free water.
Many of them have no access to, and have never had, any of the free water.
We therefore urge the department to focus on and speed up the delivery of
the free basic water to the people in the rural areas.

Projects such as the uThukela Water Partnership, which amalgamates the
responsibilities for the provision of water and sanitation services into
one coherent organisation, are a step in the right direction. This
partnership will have a major impact on the cost of providing management
and support for the provision of water services to the people within the
catchment area.

We are happy that the department has recognised the need to improve
sanitation by building more toilets and spending more money on sanitation
programmes, as sanitation is still a major problem and a cause of disease
in many areas.

In many of the rural areas in this country the only toilets people have
access to are the unhygienic pit toilets that are used by many people. The
only water that they have access to is water from boreholes and rivers.
When it rains the toilets flood, and dirty water, sometimes containing the
bacteria of cholera, seeps into the boreholes and runs into the rivers
where these people get their water. The department must move at speed to
ensure that the people in these areas get proper toilets so as to help to
break the cycle of infection and to wipe out the cholera epidemic once and
for all.

The Minister needs to pay particular attention to schools where the water
and sanitation facilities are inadequate or nonexistent. The IFP recommends
that the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry conduct thorough research
into the possibility of using chemical or other substances that break down
the waste in toilets. This could, in the future, be used in areas where
people cannot afford to maintain flushing toilets.

A key environmental problem facing us is that of water pollution. The
consequences of the pollution are often devastating. Although progress in
the restructuring of state-owned forestry is being made, we hope that the
pace can be picked up in the coming year. We wish the department every
success with restructuring as it is very important for black economic
empowerment and the upliftment of certain communities.

In conclusion, there are still many people who are in need of clean, safe
water and services, so the department still has a lot of hard work left to
do. The IFP supports the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr D S MAIMANE: Ke Mokgatla. Modulasetulo, Motlotlegi Tona ya Lefapha la

members of the National Assembly ...]

... I would like to respond to some reflection of a racist attitude. I
would like to tell the hon McIntosh that efficiency is not measured by skin
pigmentation. [Interjections.] One need not be white to be efficient.
[Applause.] Bushbuck Water is not as he thinks it is. It will remain a true
reflection of the new South Africa.

follows.)

[I would like to firstly speak about the Bushbuck Water. A Motswana says
that a person who does an important job, does it to help his people. The
ANC knows a Motswana's language very well, because it has sent a brave
person to lead the water supply project. Comrade Ronnie Kasrils leads his
department with enthusiasm and trustworthiness.

At my home at Kgatleng at Makau, the Bakwena, who are our neighbours, said
to me that they have seen the efforts of the Minister and his department in
the project called Oskraal and Environments Water Supply. [Applause.]

They say that they believe in what they see. I would like to say to the
Minister that if one wants an important thing, then one should persevere
and be patient.]

The department is committed to strengthening local government so as to
realise the efficient and effective provision of water to our people. This
shall be done through transfers of water schemes and human resources to
capacitate municipalities so as to attain the goals of providing water
efficiently. Our regional offices are tirelessly engaged in such a
programme. In Mpumalanga, for instance, our regional office is facilitating
discussions with municipalities about the transfer of water works
established through the BOTT programme.

It is in light of the above that municipalities will be in a better
position to fulfil their mandate as prescribed by both the Water Services
Act and relevant municipal legislation. I therefore wish to call upon
municipalities to co-operate with the department in fulfilling this
mandate.
Partnerships with both the private and public sectors can further
strengthen municipalities in the execution of their task of providing
water. The Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry has issued guidelines for
the regulation of such partnerships. These guidelines were drafted in
accordance with the Water Services Act.

I would also like to congratulate the Minister for the excellent work he
has done. The department will always be available through its regional
offices to contribute meaningfully to the establishment of effective
partnerships between municipalities and public institutions or the private
sector. This role of the department became evident in the North West and
KwaZulu-Natal recently.

The department provided legal and other technical assistance in the
realisation of the public-public partnerships. Partnerships are necessary
at this time of municipal transformation because they will contribute
towards the attainment of effective and efficient delivery of water to our
people. In this regard, mention has to be made of the uThukela Water
Partnership in KwaZulu-Natal which my committee had an opportunity to view.

Municipalities must take advantage of such initiatives in order to ensure
that they deliver to the people and remain on course. Innovative mechanisms
need to be developed in order to buttress such a system, so that it does
not fail at the end of the day.

In this year's budget, the department continues with its commitment to
address the backlog. Communities which were without water are prioritised
by the municipalities and will receive supply accordingly. Such
developments will happen in accordance with the provisions of the Division
of Revenue Act. Our regional offices already have established forums, both
at provincial and district levels, to ensure interaction with affected
municipalities, so as to identify projects, prioritise and implement. In
this manner, jobs will be created in those communities where projects are
implemented. It is only the ANC that can make such a thing work.
Kwa bokhutlong ke rata go raya maloko a a tlotlegang ke re, kgomo ga e ke e

would like to tell hon members that one never says all the words. Peace,
bakgatlha! [Applause.]]

Mr S SIMMONS: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, firstly, I want to
congratulate the hon the Minister for managing to obtain R255 million more
for water services. In total, R1,03 billion rand will be available for
water services, the planning and implementation of water service projects.
This will go a long way towards addressing the backlogs in water provision
and sanitation services.

Cognisance is taken of the approval by Cabinet for the building of the
Skuifraam Dam in the Western Cape. I want to express, on behalf of the
Western Cape community, our sincere appreciation and thanks to the Cabinet,
the Minister and all role-players. This dam, after completion, will
definitely deter a possible water crisis in the Western Cape.

However, the hon the Minister's regional director is of the opinion that,
at the province's current rate of increase in consumption and assuming that
winter rains are in line with the long-term average, the demand for water
is expected to exceed existing supply within two years after coming into
operation, ie between 2006 and 2008. If the regional director's vision
comes to fruition, the Western Cape will find itself in a similar position
to the one in which it finds itself at present. It is therefore imperative
that alternative sources of water should already be found and planned for
now.

It is in view of water shortages being experienced periodically in the
Wolseley-Tulbagh valley, due to weak seasonal rains, and the Minister's
regional director's vision, that I request that a feasibility study be
undertaken to consider the necessity to build a dam in Mitchells Pass,
between Ceres and Wolseley, which has been identified as a suitable site.
If found necessary, the water problems being experienced in the Wolseley-
Tulbagh valley would be addressed if the dam is built. Such water can also
be relayed to the West Coast, where water problems are being experienced.
It could also augment water shortages in the Cape Metropole.

Daar bestaan sekere bekommernisse - en ek wil dit graag met agb lede deel -
aangaande grondhervorming in die Wes-Kaap in die algemeen en in die Boland
in die besonder. Die saak van watervoorsiening is, soos ook die toesien van
landbouondersteuning en verskaffing van opleiding, deel van die proses om
die agtergeblewe gemeenskap in die landbou te plaas en te bemagtig.

Die landbou, met effektiewe watervoorsiening daartoe, is nie alleen die
belangrikste hulpbron vir broodnodige plaaslike ekonomiese ontwikkeling vir
soveel van ons gemeenskap nie, maar is ook die liefde en strewe van soveel
van ons streek se mense. Alles moontlik moet derhalwe gedoen word om die
aantal geleenthede te vermeerder.

Daar is waardering vir die Minister se voorganger se visie om die vestiging
van beginnerboere voorwaardelik te maak vir die bou van die groter
Ceresdam, asook die subsidie van ongeveer R11 miljoen vir
besproeiingswater. Ses agtergeblewe boerderyentiteite is gevestig en daar
bestaan reeds ruim geleenthede vir uitbouing, wat benut behoort te word.
Nie alleen moet die onbenutte bestaande infrastruktuur omskep word in
geleenthede vir agtergeblewenes nie, maar moet ook onbenutte staatsgrond in
die Wolseley-omgewing aangewend word om in die behoeftes van die vele ander
belangstellendes te voorsien. Die plaaswerkers is positief en goed
georganiseerd na aanleiding van wat deur die Departemente van Landbou en
Grondsake, asook Waterwese daargestel is. Die kennis van praktiese
ondervinding hier opgedoen, moet nou dringend opgevolg word met verdere
projekte.

Uit hoofde van wat ek gemeld het, wil ek graag die volgende namens die vele
agtergeblewenes, belangstellendes, plaaswerkers en dorpenaars oral oor die
provinsie van die Minister verneem: Staatsgrond wat voorheen aan Safcol
toegesê is, en nou deur die betrokke interdepartementele komitee as
oortollig uitgewys is, moet vir produktiewe benutting aan die omliggende
agtergeblewe gemeenskap van Wolseley en Tulbagh beskikbaar gestel word.
Tweedens pleit ek vir groter koördineerding en ondersteuning deur alle
betrokke staatsdepartemente in die vestiging van nuwe agtergeblewe
toetredes tot die landbou. My waarneming is dat veral in die fase na
grondverkryging, ruim area vir verbetering bestaan. By die Ceresprojek het
die nuwe toetredende boere landbougrond bekom, maar ontbreek die nodige
toerusting steeds om 'n sukses van die projek te maak. 'n Sentrum waar
trekkers, ploeë en spuite deur alle nuwe boerderye gesamentlik bekom kan
word, is 'n dringende behoefte. So ook sukkel die beginnerboere ... [Tyd
verstreke.] [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Certain concerns exist, and I would like to share them with you, regarding
land reform in the Western Cape in general and in the Boland in particular.
The issue of water provision is, as is the case with the provision of
agricultural support and the provision of training, part of the process to
place disadvantaged communities in agriculture and to empower them.

Agriculture, with effective water provision for that purpose, is not only
the most important resource for essential local economical development for
so many in our community, but is also the passion and aspiration of so many
of our region's people. Everything possible must therefore be done to
increase the number of opportunities.

There is appreciation for the Minister's predecessor's vision to make the
establishment of emerging farmers a precondition for the building of the
greater Ceres Dam, as well as the subsidy of approximately R11 million for
irrigation water. Six disadvantaged farming entities have been established
and numerous opportunities for expansion already exist, which should be
utilised. Not only must the unutilised existing infrastructure be
transformed into opportunities for the disadvantaged, but unutilised state
land in the Wolseley area must also be utilised to meet the needs of the
many other interested parties. The farmworkers are positive and well
organised, following what has been established by the Departments of
Agriculture and Land Affairs, as well as Water Affairs. The knowledge of
practical experience that has been acquired here must now urgently be
followed up with further projects.

Arising from what I have mentioned, on behalf of the many disadvantaged,
interested parties, farmworkers and town dwellers all over the province, I
would like to enquire the following from the Minister: State land that had
been previously promised to Safcol, and has now been identified as
superfluous by the relevant interdepartmental committee, must be made
available to the surrounding disadvantaged community of Wolseley and
Tulbagh for productive utilisation. Secondly, I appeal for greater co-
ordination and support by all relevant state departments in the
establishment of new disadvantaged entrants to agriculture. My observation
is that, in the phase of land acquisition in particular, there is
significant room for improvement. In the Ceres project the new emerging
farmers obtained agricultural land, but still lack the necessary equipment
to make the project a success. A centre where tractors, ploughs and water
hoses can be obtained communally by all new farms is an urgent need. In the
same way the emerging farmers are struggling... [Time expired.]
[Applause.]]

Mr M M MASALA: Mhlalingaphambili, phambi kokuba ndingene kwintetho yam,
ndiyafuna ukuba khe ndigqithe apha kulo kaMcIntosh kunye naba abakhokelayo.
Ngexesha la madoda ephethe apha ithuba elide kakhulu elingaphezulu
kweminyaka engamashumi amane, awazange athethe ngokuthengiswa kwamashishini
kaRhulumente. Namhlanje kuphethe ookafile, siyabona ukuba makuthengiswe
amashishini kaRhulumente. Ndifuna ukumxelela okaMcIntosh kunye naba ahamba
nabo ukuba siza kuhlala apha kwaye siza kulawula ithuba elide. Sakulawula
isisu segazi. [Kuyaqhwatywa.] Ngelo xesha silawulayo asizi kuthatha ajenda
yokuba masenze ntoni nini kubo. [Kuyaqhwatywa.] Siza kuhamba ngokwale
ndlela sibona ukuba masihambe ngayo.

Ndithatha eli qonga namhlanje ndixhasa uhlahlo-lwabiwo-mali uVote 33
egameni likaGalelebhayini, i-ANC.

Xa ndisenza le ntetho namhlanje, ndihlonipha amaqabane amathathu, uqabane
uRobert Mbanjwa, Vellem kunye noSoyela. Ngamaqabane la ongathi xa uthetha
ngawo ngala majoni angaziwayo, nekungaculwayo ngawo kodwa enegalelo
elinzulu emzabalazweni. Ngenxa yefuthe likaVukuzenzele, la majoni
engajonganga kufumana mali, ajonge nje ukukhulula isizwe sakowethu
kumakhamandela omvalo-bala. Kwiminyaka engamashumi amane adlulayo nge-16
kaDisemba ka-1961 asazisa, ndandilapho nam, isizwe nehlabathi ngokubanzi
ukuba uzelwe umkhonto. Izaphuselane zaphukaneka nangoko zisithi i-ANC
iyaphupha, umlungu mdala, icinga ukuba ingenza ntoni. Wavalela ijemu
etotini. Siphi ngoku?

Amanzi angahlawulelwayo kumahlwempu asekhaya njengommiselo 1 kaRhulumente
akabuyi ngamva. Ngamanzi silwa nobuhlwempu sijong'uphuhliso. Ziseninzi ke
iingxaki ezisendleleni kodwa wona amanzi angahlawulelwanga aziilitha
ezingamawaka amathandathu ngenyanga kuwo onke amakhaya ngakumbi
ahlelelekileyo, ndifung'uGalelebhayini selefikile. Ndithetha nje izigidi
ezingamashumi amabini anesithandathu, eziipesenti ezingama-66 zabantu beli
sebewafumana amanzi angahlawulelwayo, kodwa masiyithethe inyaniso yokuba
ngabantu basezidolophini aba apho imijelo yamanzi ifikelelayo ezindlwini.

Iindawo zethu kumaphondo ahluphekileyo afana neMpuma Koloni, KwaZulu-Natal,
Mpumalanga neLimpopo imijelo ezisa iinkonzo ebantwini isasungulwa,
kusenzima. Kaloku la maphondo zingxwelerha zobukrakra bengcinezelo
nocalulo. Kwakungaziwa nokuba kukho abantu kweziya ndawo. Kwakusithiwa
ngooKafile kuphela. Lo uRhulumente we-ANC uyayiguqula loo nto, uzisa
iinkonzo ebantwini.

Ndikhumbula into yokuba kunjalo nje zikhona iilali ezisele ziwafumana la
manzi. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, before I begin with my speech, I would like to say a few
words to Mr McIntosh and those whom he leads. During the time when these
men ruled here, a period of more than forty years, they never said anything
about privatisation. Today the black people are in power and they
introduced privatisation. I would like to tell Mr McIntosh and his people
that we are going to rule for a long time. It is going to be for a very
long time. [Applause.] During the time that we are in power we are
certainly not going to draw up our agenda according to their wishes and at
a time set by them. [Applause.] We are going to do it the way we deem fit.
I am standing on this podium today in support of Budget Vote 33 on behalf
of the ANC.

As I am delivering my speech today I am honouring three comrades, Comrades
Robert Mbanjwa, Vellem and Soyela. These are ``unknown'' comrades; no songs
are sung about them, but they contribute greatly to the struggle. These
soldiers are not looking at making gains, but are prepared to work in the
spirit of Vukuzenzele, and their goal is to liberate our country from the
chains of apartheid. Forty years ago, it was in December of 1961, they told
the whole country and the entire world that Umkhonto weSizwe had been born.
Fools said that the ANC was dreaming, the white man was old, what did it
think it could do. The white man put jam in a tin. Where are we now?

Free basic water to poor people in rural areas are in the Government policy
and the process shall not turn back. With water we are fighting poverty and
are looking at development. There are still obstacles in the way, but 6 000
litres of free basic water for all poor families are being provided, I
swear by the ANC. As I speak, approximately

26 000 000 or about 66% of this country's citizens get free water, but we
should be honest about the fact that it is mainly people who live in towns
where water pipes are already in place that are mostly accessing it.

In poor areas like the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo
water pipes are still being connected, so there are still difficulties
there. We should remember that these provinces were hit most by apartheid.
It was taken that it was only blacks, and not people, who lived there. The
ANC-led Government is changing all that and is bringing services to the
people.

I know that there are rural areas that can access this water already.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, cross-floor
communication is not possible. We have to listen to the person who is at
the podium.

Mr M M MASALA: Kwilali yaseMzinyathi ebesikhe sahambela kuyo sikwaZulu-
Natal, sifumene amanzi amnandi kakhulu, amanzi asele efunyanwa ngumzi nomzi
apho abantu qho ngentsasa befumana iilitha ezingamakhulu amabini. Le nto
iyenzeka. Ndizama ukubonisa into yokuba nasezilalini selefikelela la manzi.

Intsebenziswano phakathi kwezintlu zikaRhulumente wesizwe, owamaphondo
nowemimandla ifuneka ngamandla.
Ndiyavuya ukwazisa ukuba selisekiwe iqela eliza kujongana nenkqubo
yokwabiwa kwamanzi ankinkishelwa abantu simahla. Eli ke liqela eliza
kuqinisekisa ukuba oomasipala bayancediswa ukuze bakwazi ukuzisa amanzi
ankinkishelwa abantu simahla.

Ndinento endingayithandiyo kakhulu, le nto yokuvalelwa kwabantu amanzi.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[In the village of uMzinyathi that we visited in KwaZulu-Natal, we found
very nice water and all the homes there have access to it and are getting
200 litres a day. This is happening. I am trying to show that even in rural
villages water is accessible.

Co-operation between the tiers of government that is, the national,
provincial and local governments, is strongly needed. I am glad to announce
that a task team has been appointed to look into the matter of providing
free basic water. This task team is going to make sure that municipalities
get support so that they could provide free basic water to people. There is
something I do not like and that is cutting water.]

They are clearly an embarrassment and are counterproductive and
unconstitutional. Communities must take these municipalities to court. It
is the ANC-led Government's policy to consult with all stakeholders on
difficult matters. Are the communities properly informed and engaged on
these matters? Is there a clear process of notification, warning and
action? I would urge the department to develop a credit policy that would
assist communities and Government on this issue. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

[Miss T E LISHIVHA: Chairperson, I will start by answering a little bit of
what Mr McIntosh said. Mr McIntosh is afraid of talking, because in
Tshivenda we say: ``When an elderly person falls, he usually says that he
nearly fell.'' Mr McIntosh will never be able to indicate a single
programme which he was responsible for to help poor people.

I will start by thanking the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry for
their efforts to bring water to the people, because the ANC's policy is:
``Better service to all the people''.]
The department has nine regional offices, one per province. The regional
implementation plan provides services and functional support in order to
ensure that the management of water resources is effective and efficient
and promotes the maintenance of water infrastructure. It also provides
direct support to local government initiatives to supply water and
sanitation. The provincial allocations for the 2002-03 financial year total
R1,215 146 300.

The regional implementation plan accounts for 68% of the budget of the
Department of Water Affairs only. We also have allocations for business
plans and project types.

[The water committee visited the following provinces: Kwazulu-Natal,
Mpumalanga, Limpopo and the land of Swaziland to officially open the Maguga
Dam Scheme. South Africa contributed 60% and Swaziland 40% to the building
of that dam.
We visited various schemes. Some of them are progressing well, whereas some
have difficulties here and there, due to the fact that in some places they
are still fixing the municipal border issues. We even visited the
municipality of the Capricon and Waterberg districts in the Limpopo
province. We realised that water was still not accessible to many but there
is a project called Glen Alpine, of which the first two subprojects are
finished. They are still waiting for the business plan for the third one.

If there is more water, about 1 000 to 2 000 jobs will be created in the
mines. While we were visiting the villages, we noticed that there were
places where the department had to intervene the most urgently, for example
at Hamulima in the Makhado municipality. We found that two projects had
been started and had disappeared into thin air because of a lack of co-
operation between the department, local government and the community.

The Government must intervene at all times when a project is started. There
must be co-operation between those three spheres. They must not depend on
consultants, because at the end of the day, damage is the result of a lack
of observers. This shows us that there should be good relations between the
local government, the department and the community. It is the duty of the
Government to make sure that if a person is found, then he or she should
finish that job. By person, I mean the consultant. There should be a
committee before the project is started, wherein the community, the
department and the local government will have representation, because if
there is not a good relationship among these three spheres, it will be
difficult to make progress.

We visited the Thulamela municipality, where there is a project at the
Nandoni Dam and a fence project in Tshikundu. There is a good relationship
because there is co-operation between the Department of Water Affairs and
Forestry, local government, the community and the representatives. About 20
villages and 400 houses have been affected by this scheme, but these houses
are going to be rebuilt as compensation. About 386 people were hired, 193
of whom are residents. The Xikundu project employed 295 people, of whom 251
are residents. In each village, two women were taken for training. They
were trained in various things, such as being subcontractors, caterers or
Aids campaigners. That is where the Batho Pele programme is visible.]

As far as transfer of the schemes is concerned, the department has already
transferred 34 schemes and 1 000 staff members and assets to local
government, but the process is still ongoing, as we know that there are
some municipalities which do not have the capacity. The department should
hold workshops and provide training for councillors, managers and officials
as municipalities are their responsibility. Project requirements for
successful delivery and implementation should be determined through local
authorities and community structures to ensure that they take ownership of
the schemes and are able to look after them beyond the project.

When we come to service delivery in Botlokwa, Limpopo province, two
boreholes have been provided and two have been refurbished at Makgato,
while 40-kilolitre tanks were installed at Mahakane and 4-kilolitre tanks
at Sefene. It must be noted that due to the cost of addressing the total
backlog, not all the needs can be addressed immediately. People must know
that 354 projects have been completed. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, hon Minister, the UCDP acknowledges the
work done by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, particularly
with regard to its attempt to ensure that our people are able to access
clean running water, especially in the rural areas.

In the past years, more than 1 300 projects were initiated to provide ready
access to clean water to more than 6,8 million people and sanitation to
more than 100 000. However, we need to bring to the department's attention
that much still needs to be done, as there are still many who are exposed
to diseases because of a lack of clean running water and proper sanitation
in other parts of the country.

There are numerous cases of cholera being reported from time to time,
especially in the rural areas. This affects mainly the poorest of the poor,
as they are the ones who mainly use polluted water from the rivers to wash
their clothes and also drink the same water. If we allow such practices to
continue without taking any practical steps to better their lives, we will
be violating their constitutional rights to access these basic needs. We
also want to sensitise the department that despite the fact that our
communities are supposed to have free access to certain quantities of
water, this is not the case in certain areas. Some go without water because
it is said they owe municipal rates and taxes or are in arrears.

The reality is that many South Africans live in informal settlements or
squatter camps. In most cases their basic needs are not being catered for.
In some townships around the country there are still communities that are
using the bucket system as the main form of waste removal. It is also
imperative to note that the restructuring of forestry should be handled
with care, taking into account the needs of workers in this sector.

We have also noted that the industrial plantation trading account will
cease to operate in 2002-03. The cost of managing state-owned property will
be brought into the budget. We hope this will result in better control and
management of state-owned assets.

In terms of expenditure trends within the department, it is heartwarming to
know that the budget will grow by 7,6%. Of major concern is the fact that
the investigation of the special allocation for poverty relief is still
pending. [Time expired.]

Mrs R A NDZANGA: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, the hon
McIntosh speaks about people today. Who are his people? During the past
government and during the last hundred years, Mr McIntosh never cared about
our people who did not have water. He never cared about our people. There
were dams in our areas that supplied water to white areas only. They
received better water and our people did not benefit from those dams. Since
when [Interjections.]

Mrs B N SONO: [Inaudible.]

Mrs R A NDZANGA: You are people as well! You are black as well. You are
just like me. Ke nkgono wa gago wena. [I am your grandmother.]

Mr McIntosh must stop talking about his people because he has no people.
[Applause.]
The ANC-led Government has been tested on many occasions and it has proved
itself to be the best. This has happened on many occasions. Hence the
department managed to win an international award for water delivery.

Great strides will continue to be made to redress past discrimination
around water issues, and this task will need a core cadre corps that will
display the important values and culture of the ANC. Such a corps must
possess dedication to society and must in different ways enable the ANC to
move faster in changing the lives of our people. [Interjections.]

Sanitation is dignity. It has a very important attachment. [Interjections.]
To deal with sanitation requires the co-operation of a number of agencies,
including the Government. The Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure
Programme in the Department of Provincial and Local Government is in the
process of eradicating the bucket system. [Interjections.] This collective
approach allows the department to interact and through the interaction we
will succeed. [Interjections.] The pace needs to be faster so that we may
avoid waterborne diseases. The national task team for sanitation services
should function so that we have an integrated approach to address
sanitation. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Could the hon member take her
seat for a moment. I need to address several issues. Firstly, let me
address the gallery. Members who are visitors to Parliament are very
welcome. This is a people's Parliament. The Rules, however, preclude
members who are in the gallery from participating in any way. They may not
clap or participate in any way. They come here to listen to the debate and
there are very good reasons why that rule obtains.

Now, let me address hon members in the House. The Rules permit hon members
to respond to the person who is speaking. Hon members may heckle, it may be
robust and the Chair will permit that, but the development now, where hon
members are talking to one another across the Chamber, irrespective of the
person who is speaking, is not showing respect to that person.

I would therefore, like to request hon members to honour the person who has
been given the privilege and recognised by the Chair to address the House.
If hon members wish to make comments ... [Interjections.] I have just been
saying that that is what should not be happening. It becomes impossible for
the Chair to contain members who begin to become emotional on either side.
Will hon members kindly confine what they want to say to what is being said
by the speaker who is recognised and who has the podium. Hon member, you
may proceed.

Mrs R A NDZANGA: Chairperson, in our election manifesto we promised our
people a better life. Thanks to the political leadership of the ANC, our
people today have water and electricity. We express thanks to the
leadership of our committee and to Comrade Ronnie Kasrils and Buyelwa, our
chairperson. [Applause.]

This commitment has been displayed at various levels of our ANC-led
Government. It is the task of local government to discharge the basic
services. Again, implementation is not just a matter for the Ministry and
the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry; it is for all spheres of
government.

The intervention of the ANC-led Government in the cholera outbreak in
various provinces is a true testimony to the commitment of our Government
and various departments.

We also express our sincere thanks to those departments who came to help
fight the cholera outbreak. I would like to speak about an area we visited,
Botlokwa in Limpopo, where we found that people were sick and had stomach
troubles. Even the children in the school had the same trouble. In that
area, the Minister provided for the church to be used as a hospital. The
principal provided two classrooms to be used as a hospital so that people
could be treated, because the outbreak had become an epidemic.

But what was strange was that the doctor who was treating those people
claimed that there were no rivers in that area and that the water had been
tested and found to be clean. What was also important was that all the
people in the area offered to be volunteers, to carry people to these
hospitals, to these classrooms and these churches. Nurses came out, doctors
came out, soldiers and police came out - everybody was there in response to
the call of our President for our people to volunteer, and thanks go to
those people. [Applause.]

We need to accelerate delivery of the provision of sanitation. People that
have been provided with water, infrastructure and sanitation have reached a
new target of 49 000 over a period of 12 months. In this past financial
year, approximately 280 people were given health and hygiene education.

I will now talk to hon members about delivery in the constituencies. In
KwaZulu-Natal about 23 000 households have received sanitation; in the
Eastern Cape, 718; in Mpumalanga, 364; in the North West, 8 700; in
Limpopo, 10 000; and in the Free State, 1 000.

The theme of our debate is water delivery for poverty alleviation and
development. The integrated approach ... [Time expired.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, I want to raise a point of concern. I see that
there are only six members of the DP in the House.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, thank you for
your concern, but the Rules do not make provision for you to express such
concern. [Laughter.] I can only deal with points of order and,
unfortunately, I can do nothing about your concern.

Mr E M SIGWELA: Mhlalingaphambili, bendiba ndiza kwenza ucweyo yiyo loo nto
ndiphethe le nto, intonayo ndiyabona ukuba ixesha ngekhe livume nanjengoko
sendibona ke nangoku ukuba seliphela. [Chairperson, I thought that I was
going to conduct a workshop, that is why I brought this, but I can see that
there will be no time, as it is almost over.]

A budget of R20,966 million has been estimated by the national Treasury for
the subprogramme, Water Quality Services, which is what I am going to be
speaking about under Programme 2: Water Resource Assessment. This
subprogramme depends on the services of hydrologists and geohydrologists.

The difference is that hydrologists deal with surface water, whereas
geohydrologists deal with underground water, as hon members can see on this
map. That side of the House knows, because they had the facilities, they
have had them all the time. [Laughter.] I am showing my comrades. I will
not show them.

This helps us has to know the quality and quantity of underground water.
Maybe we also need to inform ourselves about what is meant by water
quality. In this instance, I will refer to the publication, Quality of
Domestic  Water Supplies, Volume one, Assessment guide, published by the
Water Research Commission, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry and
the Department of Health. On page five it says that the term ``water
quality'' is used to describe the microbiological, physical and chemical
properties of water that determine its fitness for use. Many of these
properties are controlled or influenced by substances which are either
dissolved or suspended in water.

The microbiological, physical and chemical properties are further
elucidated as follows:


  Microbiological quality refers to the presence of organisms that cannot
  be seen by the naked eye, such as protozoa, bacteria and viruses. Many of
  these microbes are associated with the transmission of infections and
  water-borne diseases, such as gastroenteritis and cholera.

This is so that we can understand where these diseases come from.
``Physical quality'' refers to water quality properties that may be
determined by physical methods, such as conductivity, HP, and turbidity
measurement. The physical quality may affect the aesthetic quality, that is
the taste, the odour or smell of water and the appearance of water. I am
sure some of us who have been listening to the scientists of the Department
of Water Affairs and Forestry have an idea about these things.

In the foreword of the same publication, which I have referred to, it is
said that the World Heath Organisation, the WHO, rates poor water quality
together with inadequate sanitation, which has been referred to here by my
comrades, as the leading cause of death in poorer communities. This is why
we must focus on those communities.

This observation by the WHO should indicate to us the seriousness of the
matter we are now debating. I shuddered when I learnt from the same
publication that some of the health effects of using water of an
undesirable quality may not appear within a short time, but only after a
number of years. I shudder because for several years until now, both in my
village, Cala - this may address the hon members's concern - and in the
town of Ngcobo, where I also sometimes live, we have been drinking water
which is definitely not clean and pure, even though it is piped water.
There are installations, but the water is definitely not clean.

What facilitation, therefore, is there for the Department of Water Affairs
and Forestry in order to be able to respond to the need to assure all the
people of South Africa that they are being provided with water of an
acceptable quality? If people read the Constitution, Chapter 2: Bill of
Rights, Section 27 and the National Water Act: the preamble and Chapter 3,
which provides for the control of the pollution of water, they will find
some of the legal facilitation for the department to be able to deal with
these circumstances.

I want to share what happened as I was writing this portion of my speech
this morning at 7:30. What is happening in Mqanduli came over the news,
broadcast on SABC2. The broadcast was about the increased deaths in
Mqanduli, and it was said that the situation is even worse than that of
KwaZulu-Natal, as a result of the use of polluted water from the Umtata
River. I actually saw the water flowing and one could see that it was
polluted. That made me look at the sales promotion pamphlet which quotes a
UN report. I am not going to mention the title of that. I am not a salesman
for the company. However, it does have a quotation from the UN report which
says that every eight seconds a child dies from a water-related disease,
50% of people in developing countries suffer from one or more water-related
diseases, and 80% of diseases in the developing world are caused by
contaminated water.

Yes, I have already said that the department has provided for attending to
this. The Minister in particular, as head of the department, must see to it
that we are saved from death through impure water. I must say that I was
pleased, though, after reading the multiyear strategic plan of the
department, because it might be thought that the department is not
attending to these things. When I read the multiyear strategic plan of the
department, I found that it was vigorously attending to the concerns I have
just raised.

I was worried that the resurgence of these undesirable events was happening
in those areas that were left behind by apartheid development. It is a
reflection of the legacy of apartheid that we have to deal with. Hence
deaths occur in those areas. It is a fact from which we cannot run away.
Those who are responsible for apartheid just have to admit that they made a
mistake by that sinful - I do not want to use other words - racially biased
development in the interests of white privilege and white health as if we
were not all created by God, in the likeness of God. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Mr Chairman, water, like the air we breathe, is life. One of
the tragedies of our country is that water was used as a tool of
oppression. Water belongs to God. Like the light of the stars, the moon and
the sun, it is meant to be shared by all God's children.

The present Government has opened taps of water in many villages, an
experience that must have been exhilarating and liberating. The only
sadness is that many more villages, including my own, in Phokwane, are
still in the queue. During our recent portfolio committee tour we came
across many villages which faced a similar plight. Dams had been erected
and teams of dedicated engineers and technicians are doing marvelous work,
which reminds one of the drama of the creation of the earth. But again,
sadly, many more dams await construction. Water in South Africa and the
SADC region is a precious, in fact, strategic commodity. Why then does the
Government not prioritise water in its budget so as to be able to wipe out
all the outstanding backlogs in a year or two?

The Government has sharpened its focus on the provision of adequate
sanitation in order to ensure that a healthy nation is brought about.
Cholera is a real and imminent danger where sanitary toilets are
unavailable. I want to pay tribute to the MECs for Health in KwaZulu-Natal,
Limpopo and the Eastern Cape. In Mapreeland, Potgietersrus, cholera was
contained and kept at bay. In Botlokwa the situation was worse, but timely
intervention saved a community which would have been decimated.

Perhaps the most difficult task of Government is providing free water for
the poorest of the poor. This is a difficult but necessary responsibility
of a government in a developing country. There are unfortunately many
people who hide behind the poor. A culture of paying for services must be
inculcated. Without it, there can be no civilised services.

In conclusion, I want to quote from the White Paper of the Department of
Water Affairs and Forestry. It says:


  Water and sanitation services should be provided equitably, affordably,
  effectively, efficiently and sustainably.

This is the one and only recipe for a healthy nation. The PAC supports this
Vote. [Applause.]

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE: Chairperson, hon Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry,
hon members of this House, ladies and gentlemen, media representatives, it
is an honour for me to participate in the debate on this Budget Vote this
month, as we launch Letsema, which focuses on rural, urban and community
development. I am going to concentrate on two issues, that is,
transformation and the role of women in the water sector.

The 2000-01 annual report for the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry
reflects the challenges facing the department. The statistics given in the
report indicate that from 1996 to 2000 the pace of increasing black
representation in the department was very slow. In 1996 it was 18%, and in
2000 it was 30%. The disabled represented 0%, males 93% in 1996 and 88% in
2000. We live in a time when we are supposed to be implementing the
policies that we passed since 1994 to date. This Government decided to take
an integrated approach to development. We did not isolate anything.

Hon Simmons is correct in his approach that we need to empower our people.
If one looks at our history, at the moment we are trying to address those
challenging matters that need to be addressed now, such as the provision of
water. It is our vision to start with early learning centres and include
everything up to higher institutions of learning. That is why, when we talk
of Curriculum 2000, when we talk of transformation, higher institutions of
learning, we are trying to regress, to start from scratch, and continue as
we change along the way.

We should therefore not isolate Water Affairs and take it as one department
that has nothing to do with any contentions. We find that this House is
empty, especially on my left, because water services may be for a
particular area. I am not saying anything, because hon members are just
going to listen, because they are going to get free education today.
[Interjections.]

I think hon McIntosh has got his facts incorrect. He does not know the
history of this country. He sat in this House, and passed legislation that
was repressive. We are at the moment struggling to reverse that.
Fortunately he is part of that, so he should please not regress, because he
does not know what communism is. There was no communism, there was no SACP
practising in South Africa before 1990. I do not know what he is talking
about. [Interjections.]

There is another disturbing thing. I was surprised, when hon McIntosh came
to the podium, hon Maluleke was saying `` fakamalahle''[promote progress].
I am not sure about ``fakamalahle'' [promote progress], because the very
person who is supposed to ``fakamalahle'' [promote progress] is the one who
has retarded our progress here. He came here to talk about privatisation,
representing just the have-nots, forgetting the haves.

As for hon Sono, my sister, she seems to be lost. She is a member here
representing an area, but she comes here, and asks us: Where? She is
supposed to go to her constituency, sit with the council, and contact her
regional manager. They will tell her where the water services programme is.
The member should not come and howl here. This is not the platform to come
and howl.

We are asking whether this budget addresses the needs. The member should
please come to the meeting. Life is actually at the committee meeting,
where the department came to brief us. We were asking the very questions
that the member is asking here. I cannot respond at the moment.
[Interjections.]

I am not sure of what is happening in that corner, but I think we are on
course. We have received two awards to indicate that South Africa as an
underdeveloped country is progressing. [Applause.] That is why hon McIntosh
rushes to the Mail and Guardian and vents his frustration that we are
progressing. There is nothing that they are contributing.

[Our people should be careful of such people as we are left with few days
before the elections. They will visit them in luxury buses, showing them
that they are against us because we are improving the lives of our people.
[Applause.]

Among the important laws that we have passed is the Public Finance
Management Act, which guides us with regard to the efficient use of moneys
allocated to departments. However, there are some weaknesses. I would like
to appeal, this afternoon ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Not minor weakness, but great weakness!

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE: Can the hon member listen? May I be protected,
Chairperson?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Yes, hon members, it is for
the Chair to keep control here. Your assistance is appreciated but,
unfortunately, it is not wanted.

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE: Thank you, Comrade Chairperson.

I was saying to hon Ronnie Kasrils that we think that there may be a
problem as far as the question of underspending is concerned. If there is
red tape, we need to address that.

(Translation of Tswana paragraphs follows.)

[We are eagerly looking forward to the World Summit on Sustainable
Development. It has been 10 years since men and women met to discuss issues
of national development. Our department will play a very important role in
this summit. As I said earlier, it is a joint initiative. All the
departments have roles to play, like Minister Valli Moosa's department,
which yesterday told us about the developments and what still needed to be
done.

There are women who fought for the freedom of our country, thus placing us
where we are today. Some of them have passed on, but we still have others
with us today. I take this opportunity to talk about the awards which were
given to 14 women during national Water Week. Most of them are not here,
but there are two amongst us. Mrs Lydia Ngwenya and comrade Sonjica are
among those who received the awards because of their important role. I
would like to tell Ms Lydia Ngwenya that she is a legend, like Kofi Annan.
She should keep it up! [Applause.]

Our women still struggle, even though there are projects that are aimed at
improving their lives. [Applause.]]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, in every
parliament of the world interjections are much preferred to heckling, and I
would recommend to you that you try interjecting rather than heckling.

I call on the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry. Hon Minister, I have
not heard anyone saying ``Cheers'' while lifting a glass yet. I wonder if
you are going to be doing that.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Chairperson, as Madiba often
said: ``Cheers!'' But I am going to wait for a whisky victory drink
afterwards with my friend Graham McIntosh. Graham's name is very apt. It
was raining cats and dogs on him from all the hon members, and with a name
like McIntosh, it was obviously water off a duck's back, because he never
really learns. I do enjoy his input. I will come to it in a moment, but I
want to thank all hon members from all the parties for their very
interesting inputs.

Let me start with the leader of the PAC, hon Mogoba. I was anticipating the
approach. It seems I have been to his village, Phokoane, more recently than
he has. Phokoane will have its water by February 2003. [Applause.] Already
there are two reservoirs that have been built. Some of the pipes are 90%
complete, and the pump station is being built. We are talking here not
about one village. The leader of the PAC comes from an area that is 46 000
people strong. I do not know if they all vote for him though. But there are
46 000 people in 55 villages. We are getting there.

I have heard from the hon member, and from various others, hon Ditshetelo,
Sibiya, Ndzanga, Sigwela and Mogoba, and we listened carefully. Obviously,
if we had a magic wand we would lay on the water overnight, but with all
the money in the world there is no way that we could provide the seven
million still without, and the many millions without sanitation, in all the
remote corners of this country, in seven of the nine provinces, in
something like two or three years. I wonder what a ball the contractors
would have. We have to have control over them. We have to monitor them.

I think to have reached everyone in this country in seven years' time is an
international record. That is why we won the global award. But we listen
carefully. We try to assist our people in the meantime. I take account very
seriously of what has been said and the suggestions made.

Of course, as hon members have pointed out, the question of the cholera
outbreak is of great concern to us. We are now following up on KwaZulu-
Natal. In Mqanduli in the Eastern Cape we also have this problem. I have
been to Mqanduli during March, and the Minister of Health has been there on
several occasions.

My department alone has allocated almost R9 million for emergency
intervention, covering the many villages of the Mqanduli area. I must tell
members that declaring a state of disaster is not going to help. We can do
it. We are doing it. We are giving the people assistance, and what they
need to know is that the cholera vibrio can be passed from hand to mouth
between person and person. There is no cholera vibrio in the Umtata River.
We have seen in KwaZulu-Natal how this infection can spread, and we are
looking at this. We are monitoring it. I want to assure members that we are
doing everything humanly possible.

The Wash programme, the sanitation activity and the hygiene education are
vital, because, as an hon member pointed out, the educational aspect can
really reduce the very awful level of fatality throughout the world. That
is why we are pushing the Wash programme, water, sanitation and hygiene
education. The simple act of washing one's ...

Mrs B N SONO: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Would the Minister take
a question? [Interjections.]

The MINISTER: Chairperson, I cannot. I thank the member, she should come
and see me afterwards. I will help her later. [Interjections.]

Mrs B M NTULI: Sit, bobbejaanspanner! [Sit down, monkey wrench!]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Let the Minister
proceed.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, the Wash programme is but one element. Obviously
the key thing is to bring sanitation and to bring clean water.
[Interjections.] That is what this Government is doing.

Mrs B N SONO: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Hon Ntuli has just
called me a ``bobbejaan''. [Monkey] [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, would you please
take your seat.

Which hon member?

Mrs B M SONO: Mr Chairperson, it is hon MmaNtuli.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITEES: Order! Hon member, MmaNtuli, did you
use the words you are alleged to have used?

Mrs B M NTULI: Mr Chairperson, I did not say the hon member is a
``bobbejaanspanner''. I said there is a tool called a ``bobbejaanspanner''.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, we have been
through this before. There is no way in which we can circumvent the
underlying assumption, and I would like you to withdraw that.

Mrs B M NTULI: I did not refer to her as a ``bobbejaanspanner'', Mr
Chairperson. But for the sake of progress, I will withdraw it. [Applause.]
[Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Thank you, hon member. You may
proceed, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Mr Chairperson, I would ask my
colleagues on this side of the House not to interrupt for it actually
distracts my attention as well, by the way.

I would like to say, in relation to the sanitation issue, that the progress
has been enormous. It is not just my department. I provided the figures in
the National Council of Provinces yesterday. It is not just my department
that got this going. We have improved sanitation in just one year to half a
million of our people by the provision of
50 000 toilets that were constructed. Together with the Departments of
Housing and of Local Government, this Government last year alone improved
the sanitation of two and a half million people. So, at this rate we are
delivering in a phenomenal way.

The hon chairperson has raised the issue of the relationships with other
departments with regard to the Working for Water and sanitation programmes
as an integrated Government initiative. This is done in a very big way. I
would like to say, in relation to the Rooipoort Dam, we are looking at
feasibilities. We will raise the Flag Boshielo Dam, which is going to
assist. We are looking at the feasibility of Rooipoort Dam, but hon members
should remember that the Olifants River is a tributary of the Limpopo River
and that there is no way we can develop there without the consent of our
neighbours.

I would like to say that hon McIntosh was very much mistaken when he said
that we were not ratifying the protocols. The SADC protocol on shared
watercourses has long been ratified and, certainly, whether it is
Mozambique, or Swaziland - I have just had meetings in Swaziland earlier in
the week, as I mentioned in my speech - Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, or
South Africa's relation to the Orange River system, we have come to
agreements and held meetings.

So, hon McIntosh should be mindful that in relation to this issue his facts
are very far out, as his facts where when he took his leader to a place
called Keats Drift in KwaZulu-Natal a couple of years ago, and he opened a
disused water system from the homelands period and said: ``Look, they are
not delivering! There is no water!'' In actual fact, just along the Mooi
River I had opened a scheme at Etembeni, which is bringing water to
thousands of people in whom, as members of my side of the House have
pointed out, his predecessors of several parties before had no interest
whatsoever.

Let me come to the question of the water boards. They are there to ensure
that local government has a public sector alternative to help them as a
service provider in public-public partnerships. This Government will not
consider the privatisation of water resource management organisations. This
is a public trust that will be kept in public hands, even as we restructure
to make things more efficient. [Applause.]

We do welcome the private sector, as we have seen in Dolphin, Nelspruit.
The problems there are sometimes exaggerated, but the regulations are to
ensure that where the private sector comes to the party the people's
interests remain uppermost in mind and that there are efficient services.
That is the yardstick for the private sector and many other aspects.
Let me say something about the Singisi rentals. They are there. The hon
member McIntosh is concerned about what is happening. It is very well known
that funds from the rentals go into a trust fund for the local communities,
to be paid once all the beneficiaries are identified and there is
agreement. So, the R9 million in rent that has come in is safe, I can
assure him of that, and hopefully, before long, it will be in the pockets
of the local communities who are definitely benefiting.

I think that the rude comment about Bushbuckridge has been dealt with. On
the Umgeni finances, they are on track and the international activities are
supportive. I saw this myself in Nigeria just last week, where there were
Umgeni board members, including the chairperson, with me. I can assure the
House that in developing their business and the business of this country
with countries like Nigeria and Algeria, they are helping us enormously in
political terms.

In my political work in Nigeria the chairperson of Umgeni and his team
helped me considerably. So we should not resort to the cheap tactics of the
press by throwing stones at every member of Government, or our utilities,
who is now advantaged and was not before and is able to get on a plane and
travel business class. They travel for this country to other countries and
are doing tremendous work for us.

In relation to Dukuduku, I thank the hon member for raising that. I had not
mentioned it in my speech. There is great progress in relation to Dukuduku.
Three farms are already being converted. Housing is being built.
Construction is well under way. Working for Water is helping to
rehabilitate the Dukuduku forest, and the jobs are being given, over 350 of
them, to the people who formerly lived in that forest. There is tremendous
progress that is being made.

My time has run out. Let me just say ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, I will give you 30
seconds.

The MINISTER: Thank you, Chairperson. About the Lesotho Highlands, the hon
member McIntosh is exaggerating the question of siltation, which is under
control. There is erosion in Lesotho, generally in the lowland areas, but
the matter is regularly discussed in the joint commission. I want to thank
the hon Simmons for his points on Skuifraam Dam and additional options.
These certainly have to be taken into account.

The last point I would like to make to the citizens of the Western Cape is
that we have discovered an enormous hidden treasure in the Western Cape, an
aquifer which extends virtually from the Citrusdal area right across to
close to Port Elizabeth. This is the Table Mountain aquifer chain, and it
will be exploited. By the time we need more water by 2008, because
Skuifraam is not going to be able to provide everything, we hopefully will
be able to exploit this particular aquifer. Once again, thank you very
much. Siyabonga kakhulu. Enkosi. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon Sonjica and the parliamentary
officer wish me to inform the House that the hon the Minister of Water
Affairs and Forestry was made Chief of Odido Council of Traditional Rulers,
Rivers State, Nigeria, on 27 April 2002. [Applause.]

The title conferred on him is ``Amire miyene onono one'', meaning ``the
chief of good deeds of Odido'' and follows on his close co-operation with
his counterparts in Nigeria in developing the water resources of our
countries and of Africa. We congratulate the hon the Minister. [Applause.]

Hon members will decide how, in future, to address the hon the Minister -
as Minister or by his new title. [Interjections.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 11:52.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on Study Tour to
     Ireland, Germany and UK, dated 13 March 2002:


     A.     Introduction


         A delegation from the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (the
         Committee) undertook a study visit to Ireland, Germany and the
         United Kingdom from 15 to 25 January 2002. The broad aim was to
         exchange ideas and experiences with the Committee's counterparts
         in all three countries on the role of public accounts committees,
         to observe how these committees conduct their business and to
         learn from them.


         Other bodies that the Committee met were the Auditors-General and
         Treasury officials, to find out about working relationships with
         the public accounts committees.


         The multi-party delegation consisted of:


         ANC

     B.     Ireland - findings


         1. Meeting with Mr A O'Callaghan, Partner: Price Waterhouse
              Coopers


              The delegation met with Mr O'Callaghan, a partner at Price
              Waterhouse Coopers and an expert in attracting foreign
              investment. He lectured the delegation on reasons that led to
              dramatic development in the Irish economy. He gave six
              reasons:


              *   Abandonment of protectionism


              *   Embracing foreign investment
              *   Investment in education


              *   Taking membership of the European Union


              *   Pursuing social partnership


              *   Enforcing fiscal rectitude


         2. Meeting with public accounts committee (PAC)


              (a) Nature and composition of committee


                  The PAC is the Committee of the Dáil House. The committee
                  is appointed to examine and report to the Dáil on:


                  *    Accounts showing the appropriation of the sums
                    granted by the Dáil to meet the public expenditure and
                    such other accounts as they see fit which are audited
                    by the Comptroller and Auditor-General (C&AG) and
                    presented to the Dáil, together with any reports by the
                    C&AG thereon.


                  *    The C&AG's reports on his or her examination of
                    economy, efficiency and effectiveness of evaluation
                    systems, procedures and practices.


                  *    Other reports of the C&AG.


                  The committee has 12 members, six of whom are from the
                  majority party and the rest from the smaller parties. The
                  party representation in the committee reflects that of
                  the House. The chairperson is traditionally elected from
                  the opposition. Members of the PAC enjoy absolute
                  privilege. The PAC has the power to investigate. However,
                  it can recommend to the C&AG to investigate, but it is up
                  to the C&AG to decide whether to do so or not. In most
                  cases the C&AG honours the PAC's recommendations.
                  Recently the PAC commissioned an investigation called the
                  Deposit Income Retention Taxes (DIRT), which unearthed a
                  lot of corruption in banks and which was very popular.


              (b) Work method


                  Parliamentary standing orders require that, as much as
                  practicable, committees should hold their meetings in
                  public. However, the PAC holds meetings both in public
                  and private sessions - it is up to the Committee to
                  decide, based on the issues they are dealing with at a
                  given time.


                  The PAC normally meets on Tuesdays only, and meetings
                  last approximately three hours. A work programme is
                  prepared well in advance but may be changed as the need
                  arises.


                  If the PAC has decided to call a hearing, it first issues
                  a preliminary notice to the witnesses, followed by a
                  formal notice.


                  Accounting officers are defined by law and are the ones
                  who are called to appear before the PAC. In the case of
                  government departments, Secretaries-General are in charge
                  of implementing government policies and are therefore the
                  ones who are regarded as accounting officers.
                  Through the Compellability Act, 1997, the PAC can compel
                  a witness to appear before it. Witnesses do not enjoy
                  absolute privilege, but can be afforded qualified
                  privilege. This Act also has "escape clauses", which
                  preclude the PAC from delving into areas like the Secret
                  Service.


                  It is normally not difficult for the committee to reach
                  consensus, because they do not question policy matters
                  and parties cannot instruct their PAC members on what to
                  do in PAC meetings.


              (c) Other matters discussed


                  Members of the public who want to appear before the
                  committee are required to make written submissions, and
                  it is then up to the committee to decide whether to
                  afford those individuals the opportunity. On the question
                  of "prescription", the PAC can direct authorities to
                  recover monies due to the State, but it does not have the
                  power to recover monies itself.


              (d) Resources


                  The PAC has four secretariat members - a committee clerk,
                  an assistant and two secretaries. The committee has
                  acquired new technology which assists in accomplishing
                  its work easier.


              (e) Lessons learnt


                  The PAC's membership does not change frequently. Some
                  members have been with the committee for more than 10
                  years. This is to preserve experience and continuity in
                  the committee.
                  The PAC's terms of reference preclude it from questioning
                  matters that deal with policy. Therefore Ministers, as
                  custodians of departments' policies, are not called to
                  appear before the committee.


                  Members of other committees are not allowed to
                  participate in the proceedings of the PAC and are
                  confined to the public gallery. The PAC does recommend
                  that certain matters be referred to other committees.


                  During the DIRT enquiry, each member of the PAC was
                  allowed to appoint a research assistant, and the
                  committee was also allowed, through change in
                  legislation, to appoint a subcommittee for the first
                  time.


         3. Meeting with Comptroller and Auditor-General (C&AG)


              (a) Nature of office


                  The Constitution provides for the establishment of an
                  independent office of the Comptroller and Auditor-
                  General. The office normally conducts regularity,
                  compliance and value-for-money audits. From time to time
                  it publishes special and project reports. All C&AG's
                  reports are presented to Parliament.


                  The office is understaffed because currently there is a
                  boom in the economy, which results in accountants being
                  more in demand in the private sector. As a result of this
                  shortage of staff, the office contracts out work to
                  private firms, but they have to be certified by the C&AG.


              (b) Relationship between C&AG and PAC


                  The reports of the C&AG form the basis for the PAC's
                  enquiries; the committee considers about 40 reports.
                  There is a close working relationship between the C&AG's
                  office and the PAC, as well as between the C&AG and the
                  PAC chairperson. The C&AG is a permanent witness in all
                  meetings of the PAC. If he is absent, an official from
                  his office attends. During a hearing, questions can be
                  posed to him and he can request to comment if he feels
                  that the accounting officer is not telling the whole
                  truth.


                  There is a liaison officer from the office who liaises
                  with the PAC chairperson. One of his duties is to prepare
                  the chairperson's brief before the hearing, highlighting
                  important matters that should be covered. In preparing
                  the brief, he sometimes liaises with the auditors who had
                  conducted the audit of a department or public entity.
                  Other members of the committee get the reports and it is
                  up to them to read them and do their own preparations.


              (c) Lessons learnt


                  Parliament nominates and recommends the C&AG for
                  appointment, but it is the President who finally appoints
                  him. The term of office of the C&AG is permanent until
                  the retirement age of 65 years, and he can be removed
                  from office by consensus of the two Houses of Parliament.
                  Amongst other requirements, an accounting qualification
                  is essential for this position.


                  During PAC meetings, the C&AG sits next to the
                  chairperson, and he is the one who introduces the subject
                  at the beginning of hearings.


                  The C&AG has set up an advisory group from various
                  interested bodies, including the Institute of Chartered
                  Accountants. This group helps to keep the office up to
                  date with the latest developments in its field of
                  operation.


                  The office also audits local government authorities who
                  administer central government funds, and it is normal
                  practice for the PAC to call the accounting officers of
                  these authorities to appear before it.


                  The C&AG is an ex officio member of the Standards and
                  Public Office Commission, where senior members of
                  government and politicians declare their interests,
                  gifts, etc.


                  The committee clerk drafts committee reports and sends
                  them to the C&AG's office to check whether all matters
                  are covered.


         4. Meeting with officials of Department of Finance


              (a) Relationship between finance department, PAC and other
                  departments


                  The Minister of Finance replies to PAC recommendations
                  through a "Minister's note". It is up to departments and
                  entities to implement PAC recommendations, and they are
                  not binding. The Department of Finance does not act as a
                  supervisor to other departments, but only gives them
                  information - it is up to them to use it. Therefore
                  responsibility lies with departments themselves.


                  Unauthorised expenditure does not occur because
                  departments stick to programmes spelt out in
                  appropriation accounts.


              (b) Expenditure control


                  To exercise control on departmental spending, the finance
                  department maintains ongoing communication with them.
                  Departments are required to submit progress reports every
                  month, which indicate whether efficient controls are in
                  place.


                  The finance department issues a statement every month on
                  spending trends of departments; most of the time,
                  departments supply reliable information. Every quarter
                  the finance department holds a press conference to
                  address questions based on these statements. If, at the
                  end of a financial year, there is unspent money in a
                  department's budget, it can negotiate with the finance
                  department to have that money carried over to the
                  following year.


              (c) Internal audit


                  There is no legislation which stipulates that departments
                  should have internal audit units. However, departments do
                  have such units, although it is not clear whether all of
                  them take this function seriously. Because of the risks
                  that big departments face, they do take this function
                  seriously.
                  There have been developments in the area of internal
                  auditing. Previously the function used to focus on
                  transaction processing only, but now it covers business
                  processes and risks as well.


                  There is a lack of properly qualified auditors; the
                  government has developed a one-year course, in the
                  process of being accredited. Internal audit units report
                  to line-function managers and ultimately to Secretaries-
                  General.


              (d) Accrual accounting


                  A new project, endeavouring to show inputs employed and
                  outputs produced, as well as liabilities and assets, has
                  been introduced. It tries to track all government
                  resources up to their point of impact on the economy. The
                  project is not fully understood or supported by all
                  departments, and the finance department is urging all
                  departments to follow it. Contributing to the problem is
                  that there is no legislation which says that
                  appropriations should be done in an accrual system.


              (e) Lessons learnt


                  Accountability goes down to the third level, down from
                  Secretary-General. This means that the committee can call
                  to account departmental officials who are at principal
                  officer level.


                  The "Minister's note" for one department is sent to all
                  other heads of departments. The reason for this practice
                  is that the matter replied to may be transversal.
                  There is no legislation which stipulates what could be
                  done to accounting officers who have acted
                  inappropriately. It is still in the process of being
                  developed.


                  There is also no legislation which stipulates that
                  departments should establish internal audit units.


     C.     Germany


         The German system is in most instances different from the one
         which is followed in South Africa.  Therefore, for the purposes of
         this Report, all the topics covered are regarded as lessons which
         have been learnt by the delegation.


         1. Meeting with budget committee


              (a) Nature and composition of committee


                  The budget committee is a committee of the Bundestag. It
                  is principally responsible for the authorisation of
                  budgeted funds. Each year it considers the draft federal
                  budget for the coming year as well as any supplementary
                  budgets or budgetary amendments submitted by the federal
                  government.


                  It has three subcommittees:


                  *    Finance - deals with taxation and related matters


                  *    Public Accounts - processes reports of the Federal
                    Court of Audit


                  *    Audit - deals with the budget and budget control


                  All subcommittees meet separately and report to the whole
                  committee. This means that the same group of people is
                  responsible for both authorising and controlling the
                  budget, thus ensuring a high degree of control
                  effectiveness.


                  The Committee has 42 members, and party representation is
                  reflective of the House. There is no party which has an
                  absolute majority.


                  In terms of secretarial and research capacity, each
                  member of Parliament is allowed to hire two to three
                  assistants.


              (b) Public accounts subcommittee (PASC)


                  The system of accounting by the government to the public
                  accounts committee started in the 18th century. The
                  subcommittee is considered a "knight without a sword",
                  because it considers accounts after the effect. It has 17
                  members who come from other portfolio committees, and
                  meets about 15 times a year.


                  The PASC has one rapporteur, whereas in other
                  subcommittees each party has a rapporteur. Members
                  serving in this subcommittee work independently and trust
                  is placed in the rapporteur.


         2. Meeting with Federal Court of Audit (FCA)


              (a) Nature of office and relationship with budget committee


                  The FCA is independent from the government. The President
                  and Vice-President are proposed by the federal
                  government, elected by the Bundestag and Bundesrat,
                  respectively, and appointed by the federal President.
                  They are appointed for one term of office of 12 years.
                  Members of the FCA enjoy judicial independence similar to
                  that enjoyed by the judiciary.


                  The FCA has a total staff of about 700, of which 70 are
                  members of the court and 450 are auditors. The President
                  or Vice-President and at least one third of the members
                  are required to be qualified lawyers.


                  Within the federal administration, the FCA audits the
                  accounts of departments and examines the management of
                  the budget and the conduct of business in respect of
                  economy and correctness.


                  Other bodies that the FCA audits, are:


                  *    All government agencies
                  *    Federal government special funds


                  *    Federal government enterprises


                  *    Government participation in private law enterprises
                    through direct or indirect holdings, giving
                    consideration to commercial principles


                  The criteria of FCA audits are the regularity, compliance
                  and efficiency of administrative activity. The FCA issues
                  special reports on matters of particular significance
                  where it considers that Parliament and the federal
                  government should be informed without delay.


                  The FCA receives the provisional estimates of government
                  departments and attends budget negotiations between the
                  federal ministry of finance and government departments,
                  and gives advice. It is also represented in the
                  deliberations of the budget committee on government draft
                  and at the preparatory rapporteur discussions.


                  Normally, audit reports on departments is in the form of
                  an annual report containing a summary of audits on all
                  departments that goes before the PASC. The whole audit
                  report on an individual department goes before the PASC
                  only if it contains significant findings.


                  The FCA is authorised to audit secret service agencies as
                  well, and reports on these are considered by specific
                  people within the PASC.


         3. Meeting with members of federal ministry of finances
              The Deputy Minister of Finance attends meetings of the budget
              committee and gives advice on the budget and audited accounts.


     D.     United Kingdom


         Basically the system in UK is more or less similar to the one
         followed in South Africa.


         1. Meeting with PAC and attendance of hearing


              (a) Nature and composition of committee


                  The PAC is a committee of the House of Commons. It has 13
                  members and party representation in the committee
                  reflects that of the House. The chairperson is by
                  convention elected from the opposition. This is taken
                  seriously and seen as essential for a democratic state.


              (b) Work method


                  The work programme is prepared well in advance and the
                  C&AG's reports form the basis for the committee's
                  enquiries. The PAC does not deal with policy matters, but
                  focuses on efficiency, economy and value-for-money
                  issues. Ministers are not held accountable by the
                  committee. Permanent Secretaries are in charge of
                  departments' administration, and they are held
                  accountable by the PAC. If by the end of the hearing,
                  there are areas in the report which have not been covered
                  by the members, the chairperson raises them with the
                  accounting officer before closing the meeting.


                  The PAC has never voted - it reaches decisions by
                  consensus. The fact that it does not deal with policy
                  issues, helps in reaching decisions by consensus. The
                  committee's recommendations are not binding to
                  departments.


              (c) Resources


                  The secretariat comprises of one committee clerk, two
                  committee assistants and three secretaries.


              (d) Lessons learnt


                  Some senior officials at the second level from that of
                  the Permanent Secretary, who are in charge of big
                  divisions within departments, are also held accountable
                  by the PAC.


                  Permanent Secretaries are permanent civil servants and
                  Ministers may not change them as they want.


                  Parliament allocates 60 000 Pounds to each member per
                  year to hire support staff.


                  Membership of the Committee does not change frequently,
                  so as to maintain continuity. Members serving in the
                  Committee are mostly senior members; one member has been
                  with the committee since 1965.


                  In doing committee work, members work individually and
                  independently. During the hearings, each member is
                  allocated 15 minutes to pose questions to witnesses.


                  In future, the PAC will also call to hearings contractors
                  contracted by government departments.
         2. Meeting with National Audit Office (NAO)


              (a) Nature of office


                  The National Audit Office is independent of the
                  government, and the C&AG is the head of the office. By
                  virtue of his office, the C&AG is the Officer of the
                  House of Commons. The office normally conducts
                  regularity, propriety and value-for-money reports and
                  produce about 40 reports a year on departmental financial
                  statements and on value for money.


                  There are about 750 staff members, split between the
                  types of audits conducted by the office.


              (b) Relationship with PAC


                  The C&AG and the chairperson of the PAC meet frequently
                  to discuss various issues of common interest. Since the
                  chairperson guides the committee from dwelling on policy
                  matters during deliberations, it is during these meetings
                  with the C&AG where they get to discuss matters,
                  including policy, which may have a bearing on the
                  committee's work.


                  The C&AG or a representative from the office attends all
                  PAC meetings. Before a hearing, the C&AG meets with the
                  chairperson and gives him an indication of which
                  questions would be important to raise with a particular
                  witness. The C&AG also prepares a brief for the whole
                  committee.


                  PAC resolutions are prepared by the NAO, and are mainly
                  based on what had transpired in hearings. The NAO assists
                  in following up information requested by the PAC from
                  departments. It also handles other information and
                  correspondence for the chairperson and evaluates all
                  replies, including Treasury Replies, from departments.


         3. Meeting with Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) official


              (a) Working relationship between HMT and PAC


                  There is a representative from HMT who attends all PAC
                  hearings. After Parliament has passed PAC resolutions on
                  C&AG reports, HMT co-ordinates replies to Parliament. If
                  PAC recommendations in respect of a department are
                  relevant to other departments, HMT informs them. HMT
                  assesses departments' responses to check if all
                  recommendations were responded to. Not all
                  recommendations are accepted, but most are, and
                  departments inform HMT if they are not going to implement
                  PAC recommendations. The Minister of HMT would then
                  report the reasons why it would be appropriate for a
                  department not to implement such recommendations.


              (b) Performance reporting and control over departmental
                  spending


                  There are Public Service Agreements (PSAs), which are
                  statements that set out the aims and objectives of each
                  government department as well as performance targets,
                  including measures of operations and outcomes. These
                  statements are focused on outcomes and not inputs.
                  Included in the PSAs is the statement of accountability
                  issued by Ministers.


                  Specialist spending and delivery teams from HMT assist
                  departments in planning their delivery and on how to
                  achieve targets.


                  In monitoring and reporting on spending patterns of
                  departments, HMT requires that departments submit monthly
                  reports, indicating the stage they are at in achieving
                  their targets. Information provided by departments is
                  consolidated on a database and is presented to a Cabinet
                  Committee every quarter.


                  Every spring, departments issue to the public progress
                  reports against targets. A review conducted by the
                  government showed that these reports were failing. At
                  present Parliament relies on these reports and HMT is
                  currently developing a new reporting format whereby
                  departments will report to Parliament. The first report
                  in the new format will come out in April 2002.


              (c) Resource accounting and budgeting (RAB)


                  The original timetable for implementing Resource
                  Accounting and Budgeting (RAB) was set out in 1995, with
                  the time for full implementation set for 2001-02. The
                  system follows Generally Accepted Accounting Practice as
                  far as possible.


                  With the introduction of resource accounting, the
                  Financial Reporting Advisory Board (FRAB) was set up in
                  1996. Its purpose was to introduce an independent element
                  to the process of setting financial reporting standards
                  for government, and to help ensure that, as far as
                  possible, departmental resource accounts are governed by
                  generally accepted accounting practice, and that any
                  departures from or modifications to it are fully
                  explained.


                  FRAB comprises representatives of interested bodies, and
                  its terms of reference is to advise the Treasury on the
                  application of financial reporting principles and
                  standards in respect of the central government bodies for
                  which the Treasury has responsibility as regards the
                  issuing or approval of accounts directions.


                  A manual called the Resource Accounting Manual (RAM) was
                  developed; the first working version became available in
                  1997. FRAB examined the manual after completion - it is
                  in FRAB's terms of reference to keep it under review and
                  to consider proposals for material change.


                  The Treasury must ensure that all relevant matters are
                  brought to the attention of the board and consider all
                  advice received from the board.


                  The board's remit has subsequently been extended to
                  oversee accounting guidance in respect of executive non-
                  departmental public bodies and trading funds, and also to
                  the accounting policies underlying all government
                  accounts.


                  The RAM is underpinned by accounting standards issued by
                  the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) for the private
                  sector.
                  The manual is updated due to changes in GAAP, issues
                  arising in departments and reviews conducted on the
                  functioning of the system. In updating the manual, a
                  consultation procedure is followed which involves the HMT
                  officials themselves, departments, the NAO and FRAB.


                  According to the timetable, the rehearsal implementation
                  phase of resource accounts was 1998-99. The first
                  resource accounts were scheduled to be published and laid
                  before Parliament in 1999-2000, and the first resource-
                  based estimates were set for 2001-02.


                  During the move to the new system the staff skills levels
                  were low, and it was left to individual departments to
                  develop staff according to their needs. Stock
                  verification in big departments was a problem, and that
                  was exacerbated by the fact that land and buildings are
                  owned by individual departments. The financial accounting
                  system is decentralised. The Treasury developed standard
                  chartered accounts for departments to follow. Some
                  departments use a similar system, whereas others prefer
                  unique systems. It is also practice for departments to
                  hire systems from one another.


              (d) Computer management information systems


                  Departmental computer management information systems are
                  decentralised and are stand-alones. HMT consolidates them
                  and is at present trying to set standards to be followed
                  by all departments.


                  An Office on Government Commerce (OGC) has been set up to
                  lead a wide-ranging programme to modernise procurement in
                  government and deliver substantial value-for-money
                  improvements. OGC also serves as a central computer
                  agency for the State.


              (e) Financial management expertise in public sector


                  There is a Government Accountancy Service (GAS), a body
                  of accountants, trainees and accounting technicians
                  employed and managed within central government
                  departments and agencies in a variety of government
                  accounting roles.


                  The objectives of GAS are:


                  *    To improve financial management
                  *    To provide information


                  *    To provide information on employment opportunities
                    and developments in accountancy practice


                  There is also the Development of Accountancy Resource
                  Team (DART), whose aim is to help improve financial
                  management in government through:


                  *    Facilitating definition and dissemination of best
                    practice in developing the skills necessary to achieve
                    effective financial management


                  *    Co-ordinating the framework of GAS


                  *    Exchanging ideas, training manuals, etc, with other
                    sectors in the UK and overseas


                  The long-term aims of GAS and DART are:


                  *    Promoting accountancy and accountants in government


                  *    Broadening the use of specialist expertise


                  *    Promoting and broadening general financial awareness
                    in the overall decision-making process of government


                  As part of developing staff skills in financial
                  management, there is a government diploma which takes one
                  year to achieve. Recruitment for staff is done at the
                  workplace rather than outside, because studies revealed
                  that people who are trained internally do not leave for
                  other jobs.


                  Trainees enter into an agreement with departments to
                  serve two years after completion of the diploma. Only
                  five per cent of those trained leave the government
                  service upon completion of their training.


                  A problem encountered, is that salary payment is devolved
                  to individual departments, but some departments pay
                  higher salaries than others for the same position.


              (f) Internal audit within departments and agencies


                  There is a Central Internal Audit Training Team,
                  established 20 years ago because of NAO's and the PAC's
                  concerns about the state of internal audit functions in
                  departments. There are 15 people serving on the team.


                  The team sets standards for internal audit in government
                  departments. When the project started, the team developed
                  and produced a manual on internal auditing, which served
                  as a guide for departments. In the 90s, the team mainly
                  started picking themes, such as fraud and value-for-
                  money, as areas for more focus.


                  In order to develop skills for staff, the team liaised
                  with universities and colleges and requested them to
                  develop training programmes for the government and the
                  private sector. That did not seem to be enough, because
                  training was mostly attended by junior staff, and
                  management did not attend.


                  The team continues to run conferences and workshops. In
                  the past, they used to conduct reviews on the usefulness
                  of the internal audit function by visiting the
                  departments and issuing reports thereafter. In the past
                  three years it became necessary for accounting officers
                  to be responsible for ensuring that their internal audit
                  function was useful, and the team stopped conducting the
                  reviews.


                  Themes which have grown recently as areas of more focus,
                  are corporate governance and risk management. Private
                  companies are issuing statements, called the Turnbull
                  Reports, on the way they do risk assessments. Accounting
                  officers are going to be required to do these reports as
                  well.


                  The debate on whether internal audit units should report
                  to accounting officers or not is also going on in the UK.
                  There are no audit committees, but the matter of
                  establishing them is being looked into.


     E.     Conclusion


         From the above, it is clear that generally there is a close
         working relationship between public accounts committees, Auditors-
         General and finance departments and that this relationship assists
         the public accounts committees, and thus Parliaments, to fulfil
         their role of oversight over public monies.


         What is also apparent, is that committees in these countries have
         better resources that enable members to do their work effectively
         and efficiently.
