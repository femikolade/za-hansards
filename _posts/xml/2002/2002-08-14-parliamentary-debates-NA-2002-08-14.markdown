                                    ____

                    PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
                                    ____

The House met at 15:03.

The Deputy Speaker took the Chair and requested members to observe a  moment
of silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I have pleasure in  announcing  that
the Commissioner of the SA Revenue Service has  offered  to  assist  members
with the completion of their income tax returns. A pamphlet is  to  be  made
available to all members and a table will be set up within  Parliament  from
tomorrow until Monday, staffed by experienced  members  of  Sars  to  assist
members of Parliament with any queries they may have. [Applause.]
Hon members, the first item on the Order Paper is questions to Ministers  in
the peace and security cluster. May I request members to please  take  their
seats? The first question which has been asked by the hon  Ferreira  to  the
Minister of Safety and Security refers to the  special  pardons  granted  by
the President. As a debate on this issue will be held later  today,  I  will
allow the Minister to answer the question but will, in view of the  rule  of
anticipation, not allow supplementary questions. I just thought that  it  is
important to explain this up front. I will now call upon  the  hon  Minister
of Safety and Security to answer the question.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the study commissioned by the  Gauteng  health  department
       through the Centre for Health Policy, based of the University of  the
       Witwatersrand, on progress made with  primary  health  care  service,
       revealed that -


       (a)  26 000 people were treated for TB in the  year  2001  and  as  a
           result, TB cure rates improved;


       (b)  HIV tests became available to all clinics from 1997, and that  1
           000 counsellors were trained in the year 2000;


       (c)  55 new home-based care services run by NGOs were funded  by  the
           Gauteng health  department  in  the  year  2001  and  that  they
           currently provide care to 13 000 people with  severe  illnesses;
           and


       (d)  services to prevent mother-to-child transmission  were  extended
           to 90% of hospitals and clinics; and


  (2) believes that the result of this study reflects the commitment of the
       ANC-led  Government  to  fighting  the  scourge   of   HIV/Aids   and
       opportunistic diseases.

[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon member, you are giving notice of a motion. Am I correct?

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Yes, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: So, you will move the motion on another day.

Let us now proceed to the DP.

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its concern  about  the  fact  that  the  hon  Minister  of
       Education  appears  to  be  increasingly  involved  in  controversial
       statements, actions and draft  legislation,  many  of  which  do  not
       promote the interests of our children or stability in education; and


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  decisions about the curricula are taken haphazardly and  without
           adequate  planning  with  serious,  negative  implications   for
           learners and teachers; and


       (b)  the decision about the placement  of  newly  qualified  teachers
           suggests that the Minister is determined  to  limit  freedom  of
           choice in favour of central planning and control,  with  himself
           as chief controller.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day  of  the
House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a man was almost killed when six shots were fired  at  him
       inside the Wynberg regional court building in Gauteng;


  (2) further notes that there have been other incidents, within  the  past
       few weeks, where prisoners standing trial have  escaped  due  to  the
       absence of security at this court;


  (3) realises that the security at this  court  was  sponsored  until  the
       sponsorship expired a few months ago; and


  (4) urges the relevant authorities to take the necessary steps so  as  to
       ensure that this, and other court buildings throughout South  Africa,
       have the adequate security  to  ensure  the  safety  of  all  in  the
       buildings.

Mr N E MAGUBANE: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that  the  newly  established  KwaZulu-Natal  Public  Transport
       Enforcement Unit had impounded more than 110  minibus  taxis  and  19
       buses by the end of 12 August 2002;


  (2) believes that this reflects the commitment of the ANC  Government  to
       end  road  carnage  and  unnecessary  loss  of  life  resulting  from
       unroadworthy vehicles which are utilised largely by the poor;


  (3) commends the KwaZulu-Natal department of transport for setting up the
       Public Transport Enforcement Unit and for the sterling  work  it  has
       done; and


  (4) calls on other provinces to emulate this shining example.

[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) encourages the Department of Trade and Industry's effort  to  promote
       foreign markets as accessible trading areas via exports;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  South Africa  is  constantly  accused  of  intellectual  piracy,
           robbing  developed  countries  of   irreplaceable   intellectual
           capital and an honest living; and


       (b)  certain financially and economically powerful countries infringe
           on the intellectual capacity  of  South  Africa  at  free  will,
           irrespective of the consequences; and


  (3) calls on the Department of Trade and Industry to assist  the  rooibos
       farmers in the fight for the use of property  rights  in  the  United
       States in the same way that European farmers fought for the exclusive
       use of property rights for indigenous agricultural trademarks.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  I  will  move  on
behalf of the UDM at the next sitting:


  That the House -


  (1) acknowledges that the  social  and  economic  infrastructure  is  the
       backbone of a successful society, and that without  it  the  Bill  of
       Rights can never be realised for every South African;


  (2) notes that the UDM has  consistently  campaigned  for  infrastructure
       development that will uplift the poor,  create  jobs,  and  encourage
       local and foreign businesses to invest in our country;


  (3) welcomes the fact that the  majority  party,  in  documents  released
       yesterday,  has  acknowledged  the   importance   of   infrastructure
       development, and has admitted that the current infrastructure backlog
       amounts to R170 billion;


  (4) appeals to the Government to dramatically speed up its investment  in
       infrastructure maintenance and development, in  accordance  with  UDM
       policy proposals.

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  inspectors from the Department of Labour ordered Arrow  Trading,
           a factory that produces  linen,  to  close  down  in  Fordsburg,
           Johannesburg, on  12  August  2002  because  of  unsafe  working
           conditions in the factory; and


       (b)  Medal Plants in Johannesburg was also closed down for failing to
           comply with the health and safety standards;


  (2) believes that the move by  the  Department  of  Labour  reflects  the
       commitment of the ANC-led Government to protect the basic  rights  of
       vulnerable workers and to  act  decisively  against  bosses  who  put
       profit before human lives;


  (3) commends the work done by the Department of  Labour  to  act  against
       factories which do not comply with the law; and


  (4) calls on workers to report workplaces which do  not  conform  to  the
       health and safety standards as embodied in the laws of the country.

[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, I want to make a request, please. There  are  once
more far too many meetings going on in this House. There is too much  noise.
Please will you conduct your meetings outside the Chamber.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mev die Speaker, hiermee gee ek kennis dat  ek  namens  die
VF op die volgende sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis daarvan kennis neem dat -


  (1) hierdie week Taalweek in  Suid-Afrika  is  en  vandag,  14  Augustus,
       Taaldag is waartydens Afrikaans se ``verjaardag'' gevier word;


  (2) die Vryheidsfront Afrikaans, saam met alle ander  inheemse  tale,  'n
       blink toekoms en groei in die jaar wat voorlÃª, toewens;
  (3) die Regering versoek word om meer  taalsensitief  te  wees,  om  alle
       inheemse tale te bevorder en om veeltaligheid uit te bou deur weg  te
       beweeg van Engelse taalimperialisme, wat tans al die  inheemse  tale,
       waaronder Afrikaans, verskraal ten gunste van  'n  eentalige  Engelse
       gemeenskap; en


  (4) dit vir die VF belangrik is om ook Afrikaans as 'n inheemse taal  van
       Suid-Afrika positief te bemark en ons daarom by  hierdie  geleentheid
       graag aan elke parlementslid 'n geskenk met 'n kaartjie wil uitdeel.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) this week is Language Week in South Africa and today, 14  August,  is
       Language Day, on which the ``birthday'' of Afrikaans is celebrated;


  (2) the Freedom Front wishes  Afrikaans,  together  with  all  the  other
       indigenous languages, a bright future and growth in the year ahead;


  (3) the Government is requested to be more  sensitive  to  languages,  to
       promote all indigenous languages  and  to  develop  multilinguism  by
       moving away from English language  imperialism,  which  is  currently
       diminishing all the indigenous languages, among  them  Afrikaans,  in
       favour of a unilingual English community; and


  (4) it is important to the FF that Afrikaans is also positively  promoted
       as an indigenous language of South Africa and that on  this  occasion
       we therefore would like to present every Member of Parliament with  a
       gift and a card.]

Re gopola maleme a rona. [We remember our languages.]

The SPEAKER: I wish to thank  the  FF  for  the  token  of  friendship  that
members will all either be receiving or have received. We thank  you.  Those
who have not received them, can wait.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) is appalled at the way the Government has connived to take control of
       United Nations potential  funding  of  R700  million  for  the  fight
       against HIV/Aids in KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) commends KwaZulu-Natal on their  practical  proposal  which  includes
       funds for antiretrovirals to TB patients, pregnant women  and  health
       care workers; shelters for orphans; training for health care  workers
       to provide triple therapy; and expanding HIV counselling and  testing
       services;


  (3) notes that the national  Department  of  Health's  proposal  provides
       primarily for more funding for Aids education  programmes,  including
       the immoral Lovelife campaign, with little practical  assistance  for
       those who are so desperately in need;


  (4) further notes that Lovelife, an offshoot of the  most  profitable  of
       ``non-profit'' oganisations, Planned Parenthood, which is responsible
       for the stupendous growth  of  the  profitable  condom  and  abortion
       industries  around  the  world,  especially  in  impoverished  areas,
       already receives millions of rands from the Government; and


  (5) calls on the Government to  abandon  their  inadequate  proposal  and
       direct the hijacked global funding to  where  it  is  so  desperately
       needed and provide practical treatment and care along with sound pro-
       family HIV/Aids education that teaches the truth about love life  and
       sex.

Ms N D NGCENGWANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the MEC of health in Gauteng, Dr Gwen Ramokgopa, announced  that
           her department will spend more than  R2,2  million  to  renovate
           Mamelodi Hospital near Pretoria; and


       (b)  Dr Gwen Ramokgopa further announced that working hours at Stanza
           Bopape, Skinner Street and Ladium clinics will be extended to  7
           pm to improve community access to health services;


  (2) believes that this indicates in a practical way  initiatives  by  the
       ANC-led Government to improve the  quality  of  life  of  our  people
       through the provision of quality and accessible health care services;
       and


  (3) welcomes the announcement made by the MEC of health  in  Gauteng,  Dr
       Ramokgopa, to make health care services accessible to the  people  of
       Mamelodi, Pretoria, and the surrounding areas.

[Applause.]

Mr V C GORE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move -


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern -


       (a)  the Government's attempts to severely limit the SABC's ``freedom
           of  expression  and  journalistic,  creative   and   programming
           independence'' as outlined in the current Broadcasting Act; and


       (b)  that the proposed amending Bill will effectively force the  SABC
           to seek the Government's approval of its editorial policies; and


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  media freedom is enshrined in our Constitution;


       (b)  editorial independence, fairness and impartiality is  guaranteed
           in the Code of Conduct for broadcasters in the IBA Act;


       (c)  these are not clichÃ©s, as suggested by SABC board  member  Thami
           Mazwai,  but  are  fundamentals  of  journalism,  democracy  and
           therefore freedom; and


       (d)  the Government's proposed plans will transform the SABC  from  a
           public broadcaster into a state broadcaster.

[Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, may I move  two  motions  at  the  same
time? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Within the 60 seconds.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: The first one is to congratulate  Mrs  Seaton  on  her
birthday, but can I move the second one.

Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting  day  of  the
House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) takes  note  of  the  forthcoming  World  Conference  on  Sustainable
       Development;


  (2) urges all South Africans to unite in the  struggle  against  poverty,
       unemployment,  Aids,  lack  of   education   and   similar   monsters
       confronting the world; and


  (3) wishes all those well who are to participate in the conference.

Mr H P CHAUKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the appointment of the Committee of Inquiry by the  Minister  of
           Sport and Recreation, hon Ngconde Balfour,  to  investigate  the
           progress made with  regard  to  the  transformation  of  cricket
           throughout the country; and


       (b)  that the terms of reference of the committee  include  inquiring
           into the basis for the claim made by the United Cricket Board of
           South Africa (UCBSA) that South African Cricket has grown beyond
           its own expectations with regard to transformation targets;


  (2) believes that the UCBSA should be accountable for the  implementation
       and achievement of its transformation targets and its three-year plan
       as envisioned in its transformation charter and vision  statement  as
       well as the performance agreement signed with the Minister; and


  (3) commends the Minister for appointing the committee and expresses  its
       full support for the inquiry.

Mr J W LE ROUX: Speaker, hiermee gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  op  die  volgende
sitting van de Raad sal voorstel:


  Die Huis kennis neem dat -


  (1) die Nuwe NP sy dank uitspreek teenoor Minister  Valli  Moosa  en  die
       Departement vir hul besondere poging  om  van  die  WÃªreldberaad  oor
       Volhoubare Benutting 'n sukses te maak;


  (2) die Nuwe NP vertrou dat die 100 staatshoofde en 60 000 besoekers  sal
       vind dat Suid-Afrika en sy mense besonder gasvry en vriendelik is  en
       dat ons 'n toeristebestemming van wÃªreldgehalte is;


  (3) die beraad fokus op armoedebekamping en volhoubare benutting  en  ons
       vertrou dat die ontwikkelde wÃªreld hierdie geleentheid sal aangryp om
       Suid-Afrika te help in sy poging om  Afrika  sy  potensiaal  te  laat
       verwesenlik; en


  (4) die Nuwe NP vertrou dat die WÃªreldberaad 'n reuse-sukses sal wees  en
       die sindroom van Afrika-pessimisme eens en vir altyd sal verdwyn.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move -


  That the House takes note that -


  (1) the New NP expresses its thanks  to  Minister  Valli  Moosa  and  the
       department for their exceptional effort to make the World  Summit  on
       Sustainable Development a success;


  (2) the New NP trusts that the 100 heads of state  and  60  000  visitors
       will  find  that  South  Africa  and  its  people  are   particularly
       hospitable and friendly  and  that  we  are  a  world  class  tourist
       destination;


  (3) the summit focuses on poverty alleviation and sustainable development
       and we trust that the developed world will grasp this opportunity  to
       help South Africa in its effort to make Africa realise its potential;
       and
  (4) the New NP trusts that the World Summit will be a  huge  success  and
       that the syndrome of Africa pessimism will  disappear  once  and  for
       all.]

  CONDOLENCES ON DEATH OF MR K G P K NWAKO, FORMER SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT OF
                                  BOTSWANA

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness the death of Mr K G P K Nwako, the former  Speaker

  (2) believes that the death of former Speaker Nwako is a loss  that  will
       be felt by the parliamentary community throughout the world; and


  (3) offers its heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones and  to
       the Parliament and the people of Botswana, whom  the  late  Mr  Nwako

                          SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(1)

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That Rule 253(1) be suspended for the purposes of conducting  the  Second
  Reading debate on the Export Credit  and  Foreign  Investments  Insurance
  Amendment Bill [B 29B - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 75).

Agreed to.

The SPEAKER: Order! Before I call on the first speaker, I wish to alert  hon
members again that there should be no reference to  any  pardon  or  release
that refers to any charges in any case now before the  courts.  The  subject
for discussion, in terms of Rule 103, is in the name of the  Leader  of  the
Opposition and it is The Impact of Presidential Pardons on the  Crime  Rate,
the Community and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Process.

 THE IMPACT OF PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS ON THE CRIME RATE, THE COMMUNITY AND THE
                 TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION PROCESS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The LEADER  OF  THE  OPPOSITION:  Madam  Speaker,  colleagues,  presidential
pardons are no longer subject to the  exclusive  prerogative  power  of  the
supreme executive. That has become settled law since the case  of  President
of the RSA v Hugo, 1997 (4) SA 1 (CC). And that means that the  grant  of  a
pardon by the  President  is  reviewable  by  the  courts,  that  the  royal
prerogative has not survived our current  Constitution  and  that  a  pardon
might be overturned should it be  established  that  it  was  based  on,  or
constitutes an irrational act, was based on caprice, disabling bias or on  a
violation of the Bill of Rights itself.
But we meet today, obviously, not as a court of law, but as the  cockpit  of
public opinion. And across South Africa this afternoon, I believe, there  is
a  sense  of  concern,  outrage  and  even  anger  at  the   conferment   of
presidential pardons on 33 hardened  criminals.  There  is  fear  about  the
consequences of their release in the community. There is  unease  about  the
prospect of another 20 or more murderers or violent criminals being  spilled
onto the streets of the townships and suburbs of South Africa.

There are critical issues and key principles  which  this  unhappy  incident
and, I submit, bad  chapter  of  presidential  lawmaking  highlights.  These
include, firstly, undermining  the  rule  of  law;  secondly,  the  lack  of
candour and transparency on the part of the President and  the  Minister  of
Justice over this issue; the abuse of power and the  misuse  of  office  and
the unravelling of the TRC process.

Let me start with the lack  of  transparency.  On  or  about  12  May  2002,
Government  released  the  pardoned  33,  most  of  whom  had  been  refused
amnesties by the  TRC  despite  the  generous  provisions  of  the  enabling
legislation. It  is  worth  recording  that  Government  did  not  initially
release the names, nor furnish the reasons for  their  release.  Only  under
pressure, in the media and here, on 15 May 2002, were the  names  published.
But I might add that there was an immediate  and  fundamental  contradiction
in public between the President, on the one hand, and the  hon  Minister  of
Justice on the other. President Mbeki  announced  that  the  prisoners  were
released ``on the basis that they were involved in the  struggle''.  Yet  on
the same day right here in  Parliament  the  hon  the  Minister  of  Justice
announced, ``You will never find in our  document  a  suggestion  that  they
were pardoned because they were part of the struggle''.

From this confusion, contradiction and lack of candour  we  proceed  to  the
second premise. That is that the Government,  or  the  President,  seemingly
did not apply their mind properly to  the  matter.  The  evidence  available
leads to this unfortunate conclusion.

For example, in the case of the pardoned prisoner  Dumisani  Ncamazana,  the
President chose to pardon someone who had escaped from  prison  as  recently
as 1999. Furthermore,  in  the  case  of  the  same  release,  the  prisoner
concerned is in fact subject to a criminal case which may not  be  discussed
in this debate. But the fact is that the  consequence  of  any  presidential
pardon is to expunge the criminal record  of  an  accused.  So  anyone,  for
example,  who  had  committed  murder  or  rape  or   anything   else,   who
subsequently is charged, may never have those charges put before  the  court
when that person is applying  for  bail.  This  is  actually  a  fundamental
undermining of the very bail-tightening legislation  which  this  Parliament
so commendably enacted just a few years ago.

As a further example, let us consider the case of prisoner Nzimeni  Danster,
who was also denied a pardon - apparently one of the very few applicants  to
be denied a pardon by the  President.  In  February  1987  Danster  and  one
Monwabisi Khundulu, and another, broke into an Eastern Cape farmhouse  where
deaf pensioner Matheus Palvie and his wife Jeanette lived. When  the  couple
returned, interrupting the robbery, the housebreakers  beat  them  to  death
with a hammer and made off with certain personal  items,  including  a  pink
pillowcase and four Ritmeester cigars.

Khundulu  was  sentenced  to  death,  which  was  later  commuted  to   life
imprisonment. He told the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  that  the
political objective of the robbery was to disarm the unfortunate Palvie  and
that this decision  had  been  taken  by  the  Cradock  youth  organisation.
Amnesty was refused by the Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  when  the
judge presiding  found  that  the  murder  of  Mrs  Palvie,  at  least,  was
disproportionate to any objective, such as stealing weapons. He  also  added
that the killer had blown any chance  of  amnesty  when,  after  a  horrific
crime, ``he started grabbing articles like the cigars for personal gain  and
pleasure''.

Now, unfazed by  that  admonition,  President  Mbeki  and,  presumably,  the
Minister of Justice have pardoned and released Khundulu. When the  news  was
heard by the top investigating  officer  at  the  time  of  the  murder,  he
roared, ``That crime was not political. Is this a joke?'' But it  is  not  a
laughing matter for the co-accused, because the person who had equally  been
involved in the crime, someone called  Danster,  wrote  to  our  office.  He
appears to have no political label and  no  political  affiliations.  He  is
incensed that he was refused a  presidential  pardon  for  the  same  crime,
while serving the same sentence as the  now  released  Khundulu.  Hence  the
allegation of presidential-style apartheid - and those are  the  words  that
prisoner Danster uses, not me -  treating  the  same  class  of  people,  or
prisoners, or criminals, in startlingly different and disadvantageous ways.

There are numerous other examples, but I think the point is well made.  This
then leads to the third aspect of this sorry chapter. The pardons are  being
used, with respect, as a sort of back-door amnesty, the effect of  which  is
to subvert or unravel the TRC process and imperil the rule of law.

Despite its numerous controversies, many - and the DA and, I  am  sure,  the
majority of members of the ANC - believe that the TRC  was  a  success.  The
granted amnesty required the full disclosure of  criminal  conduct.  But  it
required that the crime committed be proportionate to the  political  object
pursued; and let me say that my colleague Dene Smuts  will  deal  with  this
matter  more  fully.  But  I  think  it  is  interesting  that  Prof   David
Unterhalter, Director of the Mandela Institute  at  Wits  University,  wrote
the following:


  What the recent pardons cast open is a different kind of  amnesty,  based
  upon political favours or debts. Quite soon ...

he writes -


  ... every common criminal who  can  dredge  up  some  claim  to  struggle
  credentials will be importuning the  President  for  a  pardon.  And  the
  President will find himself in an  impossible  position:  criticised  for
  partiality if the pardons are restricted to those with ANC  affiliations,
  or castigated for an abuse of power and the rule of law if all those  who
  can conjure some political affiliation are pardoned en masse. The TRC was
  not a trial-run for some greater act of  political  largesse.  It  was  a
  unique compact that should be respected.

I believe that those wise words should be heeded. The potential power  abuse
involved in this is well highlighted. But I think  there  is  a  fundamental
point here, and that is that there is a section of the governing  party,  of
which the President is very much a leading part, which at best  is  lukewarm
about the TRC and, at worst, actively hostile to the climate it created.  It
is worth remembering that in March 1999 the TRC refused  a  blanket  amnesty
request by then Deputy President Mbeki and numerous others, on  the  grounds
that the application failed to disclose a specific offence.

Furthermore, the hon the President tried and  failed,  when  he  was  Deputy
President, to stop the publication  of  the  TRC  report.  He  attacked  its
conclusions on the basis of what he termed ``its erroneous determination  of
various actions of our liberation movement  as  gross  violations  of  human
rights''. One is left with  a  very  unsettling  conclusion  that  President
Mbeki is giving the TRC and its amnesty process  what  he  perceives  to  be
their come-uppance.

I believe we can talk about the victims, and that will  be  discussed  later
today, but there are some unanswered and unsettling questions which  I  hope
the hon the Minister will reply to.  Firstly,  did  the  Government  at  any
stage consult the victims or their families about any  of  the  releases  or
any of the pardons? Secondly, did they consider the safety and  security  of
the  community  into  which  the  prisoners  were  being  released   on   an
unconditional basis? Thirdly, did the Minister  at  any  stage  contact  the
director of public prosecutions in the Eastern Cape to find out whether  the
director of public prosecutions in that province approved or disapproved  of
the pardons? Fourthly, what role did the Premier of the  Eastern  Cape  play
in this process, and was there any quid pro quo sought  from  the  prisoners
released? Fifthly, did ... [Interjections.]

No doubt Harksen will be released or pardoned as well quite  soon,  when  he
does some damage to another party.

Fifthly, did the Minister of Justice, or indeed the President, at any  stage
consider that  the  prisoners  released  would  recommit  serious  offences?
Sixthly, of the next batch of  prisoners  to  be  pardoned  -  the  hon  the
Minister drew attention to 20 the other day  -  how  many  failed  in  their
amnesty applications before the TRC? I believe that  there  should  be  full
disclosure on these issues.

I also believe that we must disabuse ourselves  of  something  else.  It  is
worth reminding those who suggest - and I believe the PAC and  the  UDM  are
among them - that questioning  the  history  of  these  pardons  is  somehow
actuated by a racial motive. But I think you should bear in  mind  that  the
crimes committed by 21 of the 33 pardoned prisoners, about whom  information
is available, include the murder of at least 6 black people, 3 Iranians  and
the attempted murder of another 3 black people. It is  not  an  issue  about
black and white. It is transcendingly an issue about right and wrong. It  is
a question of selective  favouritism  and  the  sweeping  overreach  of  the
Presidency. It  is  about  undermining  the  power  of  Parliament  and  the
effective legislation that we have passed.

The hon the President is not the first president to have  embroiled  himself
in pardon controversies. President Clinton, and before him  President  Ford,
were involved in similar matters and all landed up with deep  distress.  But
I do believe that we should have a moratorium pending a  fresh  approach  to
pardons. We need transparency, we need consultation  with  all  stakeholders
and we need to remember and recommit ourselves to the rule  of  law  and  to
justice, not to undermine and diminish them or the safety of our  community.
[Applause.]

Mr M T MASUTHA: Madam Speaker and  hon  members,  colleagues  and  comrades,
allow me to start by making it categorically clear that the ANC, which I  am
honoured to represent in this debate today, views the matter before us in  a
very serious light. Contrary to what the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  would
like the public to believe, we are committed to the war  against  crime  and
to ensuring that people with abhorrent criminal  behaviour  are  put  behind
bars, so as to protect society against their evil ways.

Having said that, however, I  must  say  that  it  is  hardly  surprising  -
despite the fact that hardly three months have elapsed since the  Leader  of
the Opposition, the hon Leon, posed a question to the Minister  for  Justice
and Constitutional  Development,  Comrade  Maduna,  concerning  presidential
pardons, and despite the elaborate response from the Minister - that we  are
being called upon once again to revisit the matter. [Interjections.]  It  is
not because the Opposition has any new substance to put before  us.  On  the
contrary,  it  is  merely  because  the  Opposition,  as  usual,   sees   an
opportunity to play to the gallery over an issue ... [Interjections]

Mr H P CHAUKE: Madam Speaker, I seek the Chair's  ruling.  When  it  is  the
disabled hon member of the Opposition's turn to speak, not one  of  us  will
interject. That hon member of the Opposition has actually just spoken,  when
he was reading a motion. We were all listening, because he had to put a  lot
of concentration into what he was reading. Now  the  hon  Masutha  is  using
braille and he has to apply a lot of concentration to  be  able  to  deliver
his speech. I want to appeal to  all  hon  members  of  this  House,  please
accord him that respect.

The SPEAKER: Order! The point is well taken. Hon members  should  deal  with
this matter with some sort of consideration.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, I concur. If the ANC  had  done
the same thing, we  would  not  have  heard  that  speech  coming  from  the
Opposition. [Interjections.]

Mr M T MASUTHA: If I may proceed, Madam Speaker ... [Interjections.]

The  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  [Inaudible.]
[Interjections.]

The  SPEAKER:  Order!  [Interjections.]  Order!  All  hon  members,  please.
[Interjections.] Hon Ministers and Leader  of  the  Opposition!  Order!  Hon
Minister, you are ... [Interjections.] hon  Minister,  you  are  not  immune
from a request that you do not shout across the Chamber and allow people  to
speak. [Interjections.] Please proceed, hon member. [Interjections.] Order!

Mr M T MASUTHA: It is not because the Opposition has any  new  substance  to
put before us. On the contrary, it is  merely  because  the  Opposition,  as
usual, sees an opportunity to play to the gallery over  an  issue  which  is
neither new nor as controversial as they would have us believe.

In his reply to  the  aforementioned  question  on  22  May  2002,  the  hon
Minister of Justice was quite comprehensive and crystal clear. However,  for
the benefit of those in this House who may be suffering  from  memory  loss,
particularly when it comes to issues they would rather not recall, allow  me
to reiterate some of the facts which the hon the Minister  put  before  this
House, amongst which he mentioned the following:


  In  terms  of  section  84(2)  of  the  Constitution,  the  President  is
  responsible for pardoning  or  reprieving  offenders  and  remitting  any
  fines, penalties or forfeitures. On the basis of this  provision  of  the
  Constitution I advised the President that  public  opinion  favoured  the
  granting of pardon in the above cases.

He then proceeded as follows:


  In making the recommendations, I took various factors into account.  Some
  of the factors were the  interests  of  society,  the  interests  of  the
  applicants themselves, the degree of remorse shown by the applicants, the
  impact of the decision on the administration of justice, and  often,  not
  all the factors can be considered or will apply, although all  applicants
  are considered on their merit and all relevant information is taken  into
  account.

It is clear from this explanation that due  diligence  is  taken  to  ensure
that only the most deserving prisoners are pardoned or reprieved. Only  God,
and perhaps the Opposition, can predict as to whether a  reprieved  offender
will persist in his criminal behaviour after his release. If the  Opposition
does indeed have such powers to predict the future, it might  be  useful  to
share them with the President when  he  considers  future  applications  for
reprieve. [Interjections.]

However, until then we have no other option but to  accept  the  reality  of
the  inherent  risk  that  in  certain  highly  exceptional  cases  pardoned
offenders may, upon their release, revert to their evil ways  of  the  past,
in which case the law, of course, will take its course and  in  addition  to
reincarceration such offenders will be faced  with  even  harsher  sentences
upon conviction.

In reviewing the applicable  jurisprudence  in  this  regard,  the  Minister
cited, amongst others, the judgment in the case  of  the  President  of  the
Republic of South Africa & Another v Hugo, 1997,  which  the  hon  Leon  has
alluded to and in which the Constitutional Court had the following to say:


  The power to pardon duly  convicted  prisoners  in  terms  of  which  the
  President acted is conferred upon him by the interim Constitution.

In this case, it would be the current Constitution.


  The power of pardon  is  one  which  is  recognised  in  many  democratic
  countries. In terms of the interim Constitution the power is not  subject
  to Cabinet concurrence or to legislative control, but is  conferred  upon
  the  President  directly  by  the  interim  Constitution.  Although   the
  historical roots of the pardoning power may lie in the royal prerogative,
  it is clearly a power which the  drafters  of  the  interim  Constitution
  considered appropriate within a constitutional democracy.

Needless to say, for all intents  and  purposes  this  Constitutional  Court
ruling is just as valid today as it was when the  interim  Constitution  was
in force.

Turning to the history of  presidential  pardons  in  this  country,  I  was
privileged to obtain an article published by one among us, the  hon  Comrade
Mewa Ramgobin, in the Sunday Tribune of March  1971  when  he  was  awaiting
trial on a high treason charge. The hon member was making  a  case  for  the
release of leaders of the struggle  against  apartheid,  including  our  own
illustrious Utata Madiba.

In  that  article  he  quoted  a  National  Party  MP  who,  in  a   similar
parliamentary debate on 9 September 1948, had said:


  I have stood up here and begged the Government not to treat the political
  prisoners as criminals, but as gentlemen ... in those  days  people  were
  driven to grave acts for the sake of their convictions.

The article proceeds to quote the then Minister of Justice, C R  Swart,  who
later became the first President under National Party rule, which took  over
shortly thereafter and retained power for the next nearly  half  a  century,
before the ushering in of democratic rule in  South  Africa.  Swart,  during
the same parliamentary debate, had the following to say:


  There were thousands of people who begged me  to  release  the  political
  prisoners ...

The political prisoners Swart was referring  to  at  the  time  were  Robbie
Leibrandt and others who were members of  the  Ossewa  Brandwag,  which  was
organised along military lines and led by General Van  Rensburg.  Leibrandt,
the article proceeds to state, was a South  African  who  received  military
training in Germany and returned to South Africa to subvert the  war  effort
in which South Africa was fighting alongside the Allied  Forces  during  the
Second World War.  Leibrandt  and  his  companions  had  exploded  bombs  in
Johannesburg, killing an innocent bystander,  blew  up  dynamite  outside  a
Pretoria hotel, blew up power lines and telephone lines, bombed the  offices
of a newspaper called Bantu World and raised about Â£200  000  through  armed
robberies.

They were arrested by the government of General Smuts, who was President  of
the United Party government at the time, and sentenced  to  death  for  high
treason. The Appeal Court confirmed their conviction and sentence,  but  the
then government commuted their death  sentence  to  life  imprisonment.  The
article states that, in its first administrative  act  when  it  took  power
thereafter, the National Party government released  Leibrandt  and  his  two
cohorts after they had barely served six years in jail.

Turning to experiences elsewhere, and the hon Leon  also  alluded  to  this,
one is reminded  of  the  highly  publicised  incident  of  the  last-minute
presidential pardons granted by former President Bill Clinton to nearly  200
prisoners, shortly before he vacated his office as  US  president.  In  this
regard, allow me to quote from an article in a US publication called  Valley
News of 24 February 2001. This article ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, would you please draw  your  comments  to  a
close. You are reaching the end of your time.

Mr M T MASUTHA: Madam Speaker, this article  dealt  with  the  controversial
pardoning by  former  President  Clinton  of,  amongst  others,  a  fugitive
financier who fled to Switzerland many years  ago,  as  well  as  the  high-
dollar drug dealer who landed  in  jail,  both  of  whom  were  directly  or
indirectly connected  to  large  cash  donations  in  support  of  political
interests of the former president, so it  was  alleged,  and  both  of  whom
received his pardon.

I wish to conclude by stating that, as far as we in the ANC  are  concerned,
we understand the powers  of  pardon  of  the  President  as  being  clearly
distinct from the role of the TRC, which had a  timeframe  within  which  to
complete a specific task. We actually thank the  TRC  for  the  contribution
that it has made towards the advancement of our democracy, but  we  want  to
state that that role cannot be confused with the role  of  the  presidential
pardon, which has  a  separate  history  and  a  particular  legal  context.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER:  Order!  Hon  members,  earlier  on  I  had  cautioned  against
references. That was not limited to references  in  speeches,  but  also  in
heckling. I heard comments earlier on - I did  not  wish  to  interrupt  the
speaker - from the heckling, which referred to cases  that  are  now  before
the court. I appeal to hon members to desist from that. It does not  further
or extend the points you wish to make.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, I am sure hon members will  agree  that
Mr Masutha gave us a very interesting historic overview on the  question  of
pardons, for which we thank him.

We in the IFP support the principle of pardoning  or  reprieving  offenders.
However, we  have  strong  reservations  which  I  will  briefly  summarise.
Pardoning or reprieving effectively means that the executive  interferes  in
the domain of the judiciary, which interference is normally not  allowed  by
our Constitution. Our  Constitution  provides  for  the  separation  of  the
legislative, executive and judicial powers. The  IFP  therefore  feels  that
the presidential pardon should be used only in the  most  exceptional  cases
and that it should  be  used  sparingly  and  certainly  not  for  dangerous
individuals.

Presidential  pardons  should  certainly  not  be  available  for   ordinary
criminals. There are other mechanisms available to  them,  such  as  parole.
Therefore, persons who have robbed, who  have  committed  theft,  murder  or
rape  or  are  of  a  violent  character,  cannot  qualify  for  pardons  or
reprieves. One cannot steal for yourself or rape a woman  with  a  political
motive. Pardoning such persons would seriously damage the judiciary and  the
image of our country. It would also serve as an open  invitation  to  others
to rape, rob, steal and murder,  and  expect  a  pardon  just  because  they
belong to a certain group or party. We in the IFP  regard  the  struggle  of
the past as an exceptional ground upon which the President is  justified  to
grant pardons in certain circumstances.

As far as  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  is  concerned,  many
persons have not received amnesty from the TRC. Some have not  applied,  for
a number of reasons. I have personal  experience  of  persons  who,  at  the
time, refused to apply for amnesty to the TRC, because they  said  they  had
no faith in the process and regarded the TRC as an instrument  of  the  ANC.
Some other persons have applied, but their applications  were  unsuccessful,
because of technical reasons, such  as  a  lack  of  proper  advice  on  the
completion of the forms, distrust in the process,  failing  to  satisfy  the
TRC requirements and so forth. These people now face long  prison  sentences
and we refer to them as the unfortunates, as they have to remain  in  prison
unnecessarily. It is this particular group of people  that  we  feel  should
apply for presidential pardons.  There  are  supporters  of  many  political
parties amongst those unfortunates.

It is also of the utmost importance that specific and clear  guidelines  are
in place to guide the authorities in their  pardon  recommendations  to  the
President. The Minister has already, on 22 May, in  answer  to  a  question,
mentioned some criteria which could be applied when pardons are  considered.
He mentioned public opinion, the interests of society, of the applicant  and
of the victims, the degree of  remorse  shown  by  the  applicant,  and  the
impact on the administration of justice. We wish to stress that the  grounds
for amnesty as applied by the TRC form a good departure point  for  pardons.
There should at least have been a political motive.

We suggest that the hon the Minister of Justice, who will be  preparing  the
applications for consideration  by  the  hon  President,  make  use  of  the
services of retired judges to scrutinise the various applications.  We  also
call on the hon President to make the process one of transparency.

Coming to the wording of the subject for discussion, we do not believe  that
pardons  for  bona  fide  politically  motivated  crimes  arising  from  the
struggle of the past would negatively impact on the crime rate.  They  would
also not negatively impact on the community, as pardons are intended  to  be
a part of the process of reconciliation. Neither do we  think  that  pardons
would negatively affect the TRC process, as pardoning persons  would,  to  a
large extent, merely  supplement  the  TRC  process.  It  would  give  those
unfortunates that I have described, who missed the TRC bus, a second  chance
to apply for freedom.

In the circumstances, we in the IFP take the  following  stand:  We  support
the current process of limited presidential pardons. We  plead  for  a  very
strict and fair process of evaluation of the applications.  We  respectfully
insist that the process be transparent and that full details  of  successful
applicants be made available where possible. We encourage the hon  President
to expedite the pardoning process. We do not believe that  properly  managed
pardons would have any negative impact on the crime rate, the community  and
the TRC process. And lastly, we  support  a  proper  judicial  screening  by
retired judges, prior to pardons being granted.

Mrs S M CAMERER: Deputy Chair, the presidential pardons granted in May  this
year are coming back to haunt the Government and may  well  continue  to  do
so. These were the first batch of presidential pardons to be  granted  after
the TRC had completed its work - 33 in all - and the New  NP  has  made  its
position clear, namely that the President does have the power  in  terms  of
the Constitution to grant pardons and it should always  be  the  prerogative
of the head of state to show mercy and extend clemency in  deserving  cases,
each to be judged on its own merits.

Our position on the TRC process is that we have never been  against  amnesty
or indemnity for those who committed crimes in the pre-democratic  era  with
a political motive. We  have  always  considered  this  to  be  one  of  the
building blocks for a new era of national reconciliation. The  New  NP  also
believes  that  the  TRC  process  was  flawed.  If  there  are  outstanding
deserving cases from whatever part of the political  spectrum,  we  have  no
objection to these being reconsidered. But in such  cases  political  motive
should remain the criterion.

What shocked us about these pardons is  that  perpetrators  of  cold-blooded
and brutal murders with no redeeming features and no  discernible  political
motive, such as those responsible for the murder of the  Palvie  couple  and
even the Highgate Hotel massacre, were among the 33 pardoned.

Sadly, what  has  happened  subsequently  -  particularly  in  the  case  of
Dumisani Ncamazana - has vindicated our dismay and concern  at  the  pardons
and the way in which they were granted. In May we  asked  the  Minister  why
such criminals were pardoned. We  are  still  waiting  for  a  comprehensive
answer.

I want to point out to the Minister that in  his  reply  to  my  question  I
placed on the Order Paper in May, he listed the names of  26  recipients  of
presidential pardons under this batch whose applications  for  amnesty  were
turned down or partially turned down  by  the  TRC.  The  name  of  Dumisani
Ncamazana was not included among the names in his reply, although  according
to the TRC records his application for amnesty in respect of  a  murder  and
an attempted murder was turned down because of a lack of  political  motive.
Could the Minister explain the reason for this  omission  and  why  we  were
actually given an incorrect answer in Parliament?

We believe the decision to grant such pardons should be able to survive  the
process of a judicial review. It should also be able to stand up  to  public
scrutiny. We must insist that in recommending these pardons the Minister  of
Justice acts transparently. He should not shy away from stating clearly  the
grounds  on  which  such  pardons  are  motivated  and  recommended  to  the
President.

However,  when  the  pardons   were   announced   without   explanation   or
clarification, there was confusion and there were  contradictory  statements
coming from the Department of Justice.  The  Government  started  by  saying
that releasing their names could jeopardise the safety of the recipients  of
the pardons. But four days later the Department caved in under the  pressure
of public outrage and, in fact, released the  names.  Then  Minister  Maduna
told the media that he had not considered a particular category  of  persons
for pardoning and that he had made a bare recommendation, as he put  it,  to
the President. A week later he admitted, following what the President  said,
that the recipients were indeed mostly PAC and ANC members involved  in  the
struggle.

In May, under pressure, Minister Maduna is reported to have  said  he  would
unveil a new policy on pardons for political offenders after the TRC  handed
its final report to the President. This is indeed also what the New  NP  has
asked for. And I ask the Minister today, will  this  policy  be  forthcoming
soon, and could he indicate when?

In reply to a question in Parliament at the  end  of  May,  Minister  Maduna
quoted the Constitutional Court on the granting of pardons, saying that  the
single most important factor to be considered was the public  interest  and,
of course, he also added, the interests of the  victims.  According  to  the
Minister, he told the President that  the  pardons  would  be  supported  by
public opinion. But subsequent to Dumisani  Ncamazana's  arrest  it  appears
that both public opinion and the victims are outraged by the  pardon.  Again
this underlines the need for a transparent process.

Undeterred by the scandal associated with the first batch  of  pardons,  the
Minister seems set to do it again. According to reports  in  the  media  the
name of Allan Boesak is on a list of new candidates for pardon  put  forward
by the Minister to the President.[Time expired.]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Chairperson, the power of the President to pardon  convicted
persons is conferred by the Constitution of the Republic  of  South  Africa,
Act 108 of 1996, section 84(2)(j), which states, and I quote:


  The President is responsible for pardoning or  reprieving  offenders  and
  remitting any fines, penalties or forfeitures.

This power of the President to pardon has been upheld by the  Constitutional
Court. In the case of The President  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa  &
Another v Hugo, the Constitutional Court stated that  the  power  to  pardon
duly convicted prisoners is conferred upon  the  President  by  the  interim
Constitution.

The court states that the power to pardon is  one  which  is  recognised  in
many democracies. According to the Constitutional Court, pardons  should  be
granted by the President when, in his view, this will be  in  the  interests
of the public. In the words of the court, power should  be  granted  to  the
President to determine when, in his view, the public welfare will be  better
served by granting a remission of sentence or some other form of pardon.

The Constitutional Court outlines  two  instances  in  which  the  power  to
pardon may serve the interests and welfare  of  the  public.  These  are  to
correct mistaken convictions, or excessive sentences, or to confer mercy  on
individuals or groups of convicted prisoners when the  President  thinks  it
will be to the public benefit for this to happen.

Accordingly, the Minister for Justice and  Constitutional  Development  said
this was the basis for his decision to  recommend  the  release  of  the  33
prisoners. I will not go on  to  list  the  factors  that  were  taken  into
account because this has been mentioned already.  However,  I  want  to  say
that there are advantages as well as disadvantages in granting pardons.  The
advantages are that the power to pardon can be used to rectify  mistakes  in
the criminal justice system.  Some  people  may  be  wrongly  convicted  and
excessively sentenced. This is probably the most  important  function  as  a
constitutional safeguard against mistakes. It acknowledges that  the  system
of justice is occasionally flawed.

The power to pardon  can  be  used  to  release  individuals  or  groups  of
prisoners when the President believes that it is in  the  public's  interest
to do so. The presidential pardoning power serves as an  important  role  in
the system of checks and balances. The pardoning power  functions  to  check
the juridical power. It does this by  allowing  the  President  to  overturn
juridical  decisions  to  afford  relief  from  undue  harshness,  to  avoid
particular criminal judgment. [Time expired.]

Nksz M  SOTYU:  Mhlalingaphambili,  mandiqale  ngokudlula  ekwenzeni  imbeko
kumalungu onke eNdlu yoWiso-Mthetho nakuluntu luphela.

Xa siza kuthetha ngenxaxheba  yamapolisa  ekwakheni  umntu  ofumane  uxolelo
lwamatyala akhe ukuze abe nakho ukwamkeleka  kuluntu  luphela  nakwizalamane
zakhe, ze sikhumbule kaloku  ukuba  uMongameli  akaveli  athabathe  izigqibo
zokuxolela  ibanjwa  kungakhange  kubekho  miqathango  ilandelwayo.   Eminye
yemiqathango esinokuthi  siyikhankanye  ngamaphulo  okanye  uhlenga-hlengiso
athi   umbanjwa   anxulunyaniswe   nalo   esesentolongweni   ukumlungiselela
ukubuyela uluntwini.

Abukho ubungqina obugqibeleleyo obuxhasa intetho ethi  amabanjwa,  akhululwe
entolongweni ngoxolelo phambi kokuba  agqibe  izigwebo  zawo,  anempembelelo
kulwaphulo-mthetho ngaphandle. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Ms M SOTYU: Chairperson, I would like to begin by showing  respect  to  hon
members of the National Assembly and the public.

When we are going to be talking about the  role  that  the  police  play  in
rehabilitating a person who has been  given  parole  so  that  he  could  be
accepted by the general community  and  his  or  her  relatives,  we  should
remember that the President does not just  take  decisions  without  certain
conditions. Some  of  the  conditions  followed  that  we  can  mention  are
rehabilitation programmes that the prisoner undergoes before he or  she  can
go back to the community. There is no  evidence  supporting  the  allegation
that the crime rate escalates when prisoners are released on parole.

There is no full proof that indicates that  prisoners  released  on  amnesty
before completing their prison terms are instigators of crime in general.]

Ke tshepa hore puo eo ha se ho leka ho nyenyefatsa, ho tella  kapa  hona  ho
nyatsa ditokelo tseo Mopresidente wa naha a nang  le  tsona,  ka  ho  latela
Molaotheo wa naha. [I hope that the speech is not trying to  belittle,  show
disrespect for or undermine the rights of the  President  in  terms  of  the
Constitution of our country.]

Unfortunately, no one,  not  even  the  Opposition,  could  predict  that  a
prisoner, after having been screened and pardoned by the President or  after
he or she had served their full sentence, would soon commit  another  crime.
The SA Police Service are  there  to  safeguard,  protect  and  prevent  the
escalation of any form of crime.

Ze sikhumbule kaloku ukuba amapolisa asebenzisana nama-CPF phaya  ngaphandle
xa umntu sele ekhululwe engaphandle. [We should remember  that  police  work
together with CPFs when a person has been released.]

There are some programmes.

Naye lo mntu, xa efika phakathi koluntu, uza  enezakhono  azifumene  kwiSebe
leeNkonzo  zoLuleko,   ze   azisebenzise   phaya   ngaphandle   ukuncedisana
nokuphucula ubomi bakhe nobosapho lwakhe.

Xa  sithetha  ngamabanjwa  axolelwayo,  sithetha  ngabantu  abanikwa  ithuba
lokuphinda bakhe ngokutsha ubomi  babo.  Ngubani  obesazi  ukuba  siya  kube
sisithi indoda emhlophe yasePitoli yavuka ekuseni,  intloko  iqaqamba,  yaya
esitratweni, yafika yadubula abantu abantu abasixhenxe bafa? Kambe  ke  kuye
kwafunyaniswa ukuba inelungelo lokuba ixolelwe.

Ukuxolelwa asiyonto siqala ukuva ngayo namhlanje xa isenziwa nguZizi.  Thina
aba  saxolelwa  ukuze  sibe  negunya  lokuphila  namhlanje.  Kutsho  incwadi
engcwele. Ndiyaqonda  ukuba  ningamaKristu  nonke  apha,  nizibiza  ngelithi
ningamaKristu.  Kwafuneka  sixolelwe  ukuze  nathi  sixolele  abo  basonayo.
Ndiyakholwa ukuba sonke apha siyathandaza, kwaye into yokuqala  esiyifundayo
emakhaya xa sikhulayo nguBawo wethu oseZulwini, kodwa sithi  kuZizi,  ``Hayi
Zizi, musa ukubaxolela.'' (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[When this person (that has  been  released)  joins  other  members  of  the
community he or she brings along skills that he or she would  have  acquired
through the Department of Correctional Services and uses them to assist  and
develop his or her life and that of his or her family.

When we speak about prisoners that are released on parole,  we  speak  about
people that are being given another chance to change  their  lives  for  the
better. Who knew that the white man who woke  up  one  day  and  went  on  a
rampage and shot and killed seven people would today be released on parole?

Presidential pardon is not something new just because Zizi granted it.  Some
of us here were granted amnesty and were given another chance  to  live.  So
says the Holy Book. I think all of you here are  Christians.  You  refer  to
yourselves as Christians. We had to be pardoned so we could  pardon  others.
I trust that all of us here do pray and the first  thing  we  learn  at  our
homes when we  grow  up  is  The  Lord's  Prayer,  but  then  we  contradict
ourselves when we say to Zizi, ``No Zizi, do not forgive them.'']

(Translation of Sotho paragraph follows)

[Madam Speaker, I remember when I was  still  young,  being  raised  on  the
farm. Every time that 31 April came round, it would be  a  holiday  for  us,
and the school would close. I still remember well, we would be  taken  on  a
tour in our master's truck, and the  master  would  be  driving  the  truck,
taking us to the station to see the blue train. We would know that when  the
blue train arrived they would say ...]

[Because we could not speak, we could not ask reasons, we could not ask  the
criteria, we could not ask anything, we would just  be  happy  to  see  them
among us. We had no right to ask how they were released.

We now have an opportunity because the  ANC  Government  has  given  us  the
right to ask for the reasons for the release of the prisoners.]

Masingafani namalulwane, sifune ukwenza ngathi ukuxolelwa kwamabanjwa  yinto
entsha. Siyayazi ukuba nakwamanye amazwe  yinto  eyabakho  kwakudala,  kwaye
aba bantu, beze nale ngxoxo-mpikiswano  apha,  bayazi  kakuhle  ukuba  yinto
eyenziwayo nakwamanye amazwe. Ngoku, ngenxa yokuba ingulo Rhulumente  ukhoyo
we-ANC, kufuneka size kuma apha sicacise  ukuba  yiyiphi  na  le  miqathango
siye sayilandela ekwenzeni le nto.
Kunjalo nje, lo Mgaqo-siseko siwunonelelayo sasivumelene ngawo  sonke  apha,
singamalungu   ePalamente.   Masingatyholi   ulwaphulo-mthetho   xa   sifuna
ukuwudelela uMgaqo-siseko. Maze bakhumbule intetho ethi,  ``Ongenasono  apha
phakathi   kwenu,   makathabathe   ilitye   amxulube    umfazi    onesono.''
[Kwaqhwatywa] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)
[We should not be like bats  and  pretend,  as  if  releasing  prisoners  on
parole is a new event. We know that it is  a  very  old  tradition  and  the
people who brought this debate up know very well that it is  done  in  other
countries. Now, because it is the ANC-led Government, we have to stand  here
and justify our decisions and explain the conditions we  followed  in  doing
this.

At the same time it should be clear that the Constitution  we  are  boasting
about was agreed upon by all of us here as members  of  Parliament.  Let  us
not use crime  as  a  scapegoat  when  we  do  not  want  to  abide  by  the
Constitution. They should remember the saying,  ``He  that  is  without  sin
among you, let him first cast a stone at her.'' [Applause.]]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson, in  an  interview  published  in  the  Sunday
Independent on  19  May  2002,  former  TRC  head  Archbishop  Desmond  Tutu
complained that the unfortunate  pardons  granted  by  the  President  would
undermine the work of the TRC.

An international human rights organisation, Human Rights Watch, said of  the
TRC process:


  Repeated amnesties will reinforce the culture of impunity which is one of
  the most serious obstacles to achieving an end to violence today.

Yet the President has gone against their advice  and  has  given  pardon  to
people whose appearance before the TRC did not  qualify  them  for  amnesty.
The President did this without making the public aware of  their  background
or the crimes that they had committed. He also did not  shed  any  light  on
what criteria were used in selecting these specific criminals and why  they,
who were denied amnesty in the first place, were favoured above victims  who
are still awaiting reparations.

The ACDP believes that family members of  victims  of  crime  must  have  an
important say in the pardoning of any criminal. Their  feelings  and  rights
have to be given priority whenever such considerations are taking place.  If
they approve of such pardons, the process may then be taken forward, but  if
they oppose such pardons, then their wish must be respected by turning  down
the request or recommendation of anyone to be pardoned.

We in the ACDP believe that anyone found guilty of crimes  such  as  murder,
rape, armed robbery  and  hijacking  should  not  receive  any  presidential
pardon.  Obviously,  this  excludes  those  who  murdered  while   defending
themselves or members of their families.

Let me conclude by reminding this House that it is wrong  to  pardon  anyone
against the wishes of those  whom  they  have  wronged.  Victims  and  their
families, and not members of Government,  feel  the  pain  and  trauma  that
results from crime. In  a  country  where  levels  of  crime  are  so  high,
Government, especially the President, must show concern about the  suffering
experienced by all victims, and then find ways of saying to them,  ``I  care
about you.'' [Applause.] [Time expired.]

Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, the pardoning or reprieving  competence  of  the
President is something that one will find in most  modern  constitutions  in
the world. As such there is nothing strange or wrong  with  that  -  but  we
have a problem here.

Here we have a situation where a convicted murderer, also for deeds  clearly
without any political motive, was sent to jail for  51  years.  However,  on
the advice of the Minister for Justice and Constitutional  Development,  the
President has now pardoned  this  person  and  within  two  weeks  of  being
allowed out of jail, this person  allegedly  committed  another  crime.  The
President, when granting  these  33  pardons,  said  that  their  acts  were
clearly political. It is also clear that all their acts were not political.

Section 84 of the Constitution deals with the powers and  functions  of  the
President and in 84(2)(j)  the  pardoning  or  reprieving  of  offenders  is
stipulated as a specific function and responsibility of the President.

The current events are a huge  embarrassment  to  the  President  and  South
Africa. Why is the President in this intolerable situation today? We are  in
this situation because we have not finally dealt with the conflicts  of  the
past. There are people across the  political  spectrum  in  jail  today  who
clearly should have received amnesty, but for various reasons they did  not.
I can give the House the names of 38 Afrikaners who are still  in  jail  and
who should have been released. We cannot close the  books  of  the  past  as
long as this is the case.

In order to conclude  this,  we  now  need  action;  either  by  an  Act  of
Parliament to grant a general  amnesty  with  regard  to  those  cases  with
political motives that are still outstanding, or by way  of  a  presidential
pardoning process after applying the correct, strict criteria. It is no  use
to shy away from this and to draw  the  President  into  this  situation  by
using his general presidential competence to  pardon  and  reprieve  in  the
wrong way as has happened now.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, the truth of the  saying  that  ``uneasy  lies
the head that wears the crown'', is borne out by a  debate  like  this.  The
President  as  head  of  state,  according  to  section  84(2)(j)   of   the
Constitution, has responsibility for pardoning or reprieving  offenders  and
remitting any fines, penalties or forfeitures. There is no qualification  of
which offenders may be pardoned or reprieved. The President has to  do  this
in the best national interest.

If he  decides  not  to  pardon,  he  is  looked  upon  as  being  cold  and
insensitive in some quarters. If he pardons,  some  feel  he  has  not  done
enough,  because  some  offenders  who  deserve  pardon   have   been   left
languishing in jail, while  others  would  argue  that  he  has  opened  the
sluicegates, as is the case in this debate.

It is possible that innocent  people  may  be  in  jail  because  of  sloppy
investigations, prosecutions and judicial processes.  It  is  also  possible
that unrepentant and unrehabilitated criminals may be  pardoned  because  of
human  error  in  the  justice  and  correctional  services,  as  these  are
institutions that make recommendations. In extreme cases  politics  come  to
bear and it is from such representations  that  some  undeserving  offenders
are let free.

We maintain that people who  have  been  incarcerated  for  crimes  such  as
murder, rape and robbery are undeserving of pardon. The  example  of  Barend
Strydom comes to mind.  He  remains  unrepentant  after  having  mowed  down
blacks in downtown Pretoria. We  in  the  UCDP  view  him  as  a  danger  to
society, especially after his pledge of support to Kritzinger on Monday.

In certifying the current Constitution, the Constitutional Court  stated  in
paragraph 116 of Certification Judgment I that:


  Any exercise of the power to pardon that undermines any provision of  the
  Constitution will be reviewable.

This indicates that pardons may be revoked if the  pardoned  people  conduct
themselves in a wayward manner on their release.

While we appreciate the presidential prerogative  to  pardon  offenders,  we
maintain that it should be done  with  circumspection  and  regard  for  the
interests of the community. [Time expired.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the TRC had a mammoth assignment of  building  a
bridge across the walls of racial hostility and  conflict.  When  the  final
draft report was given it was clear that the unfinished  business  would  be
the responsibility of the President under presidential  pardon,  as  is  the
case in all democracies of the world.  I  have  supported  the  granting  of
presidential pardon in all the debates on this matter.

Let me say outright that soldiers in a liberation struggle are of two  kinds
- those who fight against oppression and those who  defend  oppression.  The
PAC condemns murder, including that of Martin  Whitaker  who  was  allegedly
killed by Dumisani Ncamazana soon after he received presidential pardon.

The PAC  extends  heartfelt  condolences  to  the  Whitaker  family  and  Mr
Whitaker's next of kin. Crime is crime and should be condemned.

This calls for tougher sentences  for  those  who  misuse  the  presidential
pardon, and therefore prejudice the chances of many innocent  and  justified
applicants for pardon. It also calls for improvement of our prisons.

It is therefore not  right  to  call  into  question  the  validity  of  the
principle of presidential pardon. Pardon is not the same as acquittal  in  a
court of law. Pardon, like forgiveness, depends on the thinking,  conscience
and wisdom of the one who gives it.

We can give our opinion and even be critical of the pardon but  we  must  be
careful not to sound disrespectful to  the  President  of  the  time  or  to
suggest that the President should reflect our viewpoints or  our  sentiments
as a collective. [Applause.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÃ: Chairperson, may I at the outset say that  the  DA  convey
their condolences to the families and friends  of  those  who  died  at  the
hands of those who were pardoned by the President.

Why is it that day after day, week  after  week,  month  after  month,  year
after year, items appear on the political agenda for  which  South  Africans
have to pardon ANC Ministers or the President for making a wrong  statement,
like the antiretroviral treatment; or a wrong decision,  like  that  of  the
Sarafina play that went wild? Or today, a pardon for a pardon of  criminals?
May we ask: Do these items appear on the political  agenda  because  of  the
``zanufication'' process that member Cronin warned South Africa about?

When the President and his Cabinet were sworn  in,  they  took  an  oath  to
uphold the Constitution, which in turn is supposed  to  be  a  guarantee  to
protect the people of South Africa  against  violent  criminals.  They  were
supposed to make South Africa a safe country to live in.

What do  we  experience  since  the  ANC  Government  took  office?  Violent
criminals whom the TRC did not want to be released into society -  murderers
whom Bishop Tutu  said  should  not  be  allowed  outside  maximum  security
prisons - were pardoned by the President and the Minister.

The perception exists that the  ANC  membership  card  proved  to  be  their
licence to be let free. When clergy and followers  of  the  Christian  faith
warned the President and the Minister not to release these  criminals,  what
did they do? In no uncertain  terms,  they  belittled  those  people.  [Time
expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, before you leave, I  think
the Speaker made it quite clear that one needed to advance  the  debate  and
the argument related to the topic. I have a problem with the hon  member  at
the podium when he used the  words,  ``  at  the  hands  of  those  who  the
President pardoned''. That implies that all those who were pardoned were  so
involved in the commission of crime. I would like you to be careful  in  the
manner in which you phrase that, in order that we can allow for  the  debate
to  go  forward  without  exaggerating   it   as   the   hon   member   did.
[Interjections.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÃ: Thank you, Chairperson. I meant at  the  hand  of  one  of
those  pardoned.  [Interjections.]  The  ANC  ignored  the  TRC  ...   [Time
expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, I think the Speaker  laid
down the parameters within which this debate should go. Some of the  members
have been transgressing slightly. It makes it difficult  for  the  Chair  to
actually interrupt people, especially when you have very limited  time.  May
I once again appeal to members to follow the guidelines that were laid  down
by the Speaker at the beginning of the debate.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Voorsitter, die beginsel van presidensiÃ«le  begenadiging  soos
vervat in artikel 84(j) van die Grondwet is so oud soos die beskawing  self.
Ons vind selfs iets daarvan terug in Levitikus met die  instelling  van  die
jubeljaar waartydens gevangenes vrygelaat is.  Die  bekendste  voorbeeld  is
met die verhoor  van  Christus,  as  Pilatus  volgens  die  gebruik  op  die
Paasfees, vir Barrabas vir die volk loslaat. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die beginsel is dat genade betoon mag word, selfs daar waar die reg nie  kan
bykom nie; dat genade, versoening en herstel, naas die regsproses van  straf
en vergelding, ook 'n gemeenskap kan heelmaak.

Daarom is dit gebiedend noodsaaklik dat dit so toegepas  word  dat  dit  nie
die teenoorgestelde effek bereik nie,  soos  ons  pas  beleef  het  met  die
begenadigdes, wat kort daarna aangekla is van ernstige  misdrywe.  Die  feit
dat van hulle  nog  kort  vantevore  probeer  ontsnap  het,  is  verswarende
omstandighede vir die gebrek aan  oordeel  wat  aan  die  dag  gelÃª  is,  en
waarvoor die President verantwoordelikheid moet aanvaar.

In  die   besondere   omstandighede   in   Suid-Afrika   kan   presidensiÃ«le
begenadiging, indien reg en konsekwent toegepas, ook 'n helende  rol  speel.
Teen die agtergrond van die jarelange  stryd  en  konflik  kan  dit  daartoe
bydra dat  die  boeke  van  die  verlede  toegemaak  word  ten  opsigte  van
politieke gevangenes aan beide kante  van  die  spektrum.  Die  WVK  was  'n
instrument vir 'n bepaalde tyd, maar is nie die alfa en die omega nie  -  en
nihileer nie artikel 84(j) van die Grondwet nie.

Daar is egter belangrike voorwaardes. Die profiel, gedrag  en  rehabilitasie
van die gevangene moet in ag geneem  word.  Dit  kan  slegs  op  individuele
meriete geskied en nie in die bondel soos  met  die  Oos-Kaap  33  nie.  Aan
watter kant van die stryd die gevangene deelgeneem het, mag  nie  'n  faktor
wees nie.

Onderskeid moet  gemaak  word  tussen  bona  fide  politieke  oortreders  en
kriminele booswigte wat die politieke stryd as dekmantel  gebruik  het.  Die
kriteria moet bekend gemaak word en die proses moet deursigtig wees.

Die  AEB  ondersteun  die  beginsel  van  presidensiÃ«le  begenadiging,  maar
ongelukkig, soos in die geval van Pilatus  en  Barrabas,  is  die  verkeerde
gevangene vrygelaat - dalk met tragiese gevolge. Niemand  kan  waarborg  wat
gaan  gebeur  nie.  [Tyd  verstreke.]  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   speech
follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson,  the  principle  of  presidential  pardoning,  as
contained in section 84(j) of the Constitution, is as  old  as  civilisation
itself. We even find something similar as far back  as  in  Leviticus,  when
the jubilee year was instituted, during which prisoners were set  free.  The
most well-known example is that of the trial of Christ, when,  according  to
the custom during the Easter festival,  Pilate  set  Barrabas  free  at  the
request of the people. [Interjections.]

The principle is that mercy may be shown, even where the law  cannot  reach,
that a community can also be restored by means of mercy, reconciliation  and
restoration, alongside the legal process of punishment and retribution.

It is therefore vitally important that this principle is applied in  such  a
way that it does not have the opposite effect, as was  recently  experienced
with those to whom a reprieve had been granted, who were accused of  serious
offences shortly afterwards. The fact that they had tried to escape  shortly
before that is tantamount  to  aggravating  circumstances  in  the  lack  of
judgment  shown,   something   for   which   the   President   must   accept
responsibility.

In the particular circumstances in South Africa presidential  pardoning,  if
it is applied correctly and consistently, can  also  play  a  healing  role.
Against the background of struggle and conflict  which  prevailed  for  many
years it can contribute to closing the books  of  the  past  in  respect  of
political  prisoners  on  both  sides  of  the  spectrum.  The  TRC  was  an
instrument for a specific time, but not the alpha and the omega, and it  did
not nullify section 84(j) of the Constitution.

However,  there  are  important  conditions.  The  profile,  behaviour   and
rehabilitation of the prisoner must be taken into account. This can be  done
only on individual merit and not in batches as in the case  of  the  Eastern
Cape 33. The side of the battle on which the  prisoner  participated  cannot
be a factor.

A distinction must  be  made  between  bona  fide  political  offenders  and
criminals who use the political struggle as a cover-up. The criteria  should
be made known and the process should be transparent.

The  AEB   supports   the   principle   of   presidential   pardoning,   but
unfortunately, as in the case of Pilate and  Barrabas,  the  wrong  prisoner
has been released - perhaps with tragic consequences. No one  can  guarantee
what is going to happen. [Time expired.]]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, AZAPO supports the  process  of  pardoning
people as prescribed in the Constitution and other mechanisms that put  that
into effect.

We must realise that pardons by  themselves  are  of  the  nature  that  one
pardons people who have done something wrong. Otherwise, there would  be  no
reason why one should pardon anybody.

As a result, the arguments that they should not have been pardoned could  be
addressed by those who should  address  the  criteria  which  were  used  to
pardon. It cannot be an argument to say  that  they  should  not  have  been
pardoned, when there is a mechanism for doing so.

If one checks the statistics in respect of the one person  who  after  being
pardoned, went to commit crime and one reduces that to statistical data,  it
is insignificant. The argument that this will perturb  the  population  will
not hold water. [Interjections.] Every process of  pardoning  has  criteria.
Every process, whether one is in church and is forgiven,  has  processes  to
do so. Therefore it cannot hold water  that  we  must  be  critical  of  the
process that has been set in place.

AZAPO will go even further to  say  that  there  is  nothing  wrong  if  the
President applies the criteria that those who fought against  evil  must  be
pardoned. [Interjections.] Those who fought against and  not  for  evil.  We
will not have a problem in supporting a  move  that  those  who  fought  for
equality, justice and against  evil  should  be  pardoned.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Chairperson, sitting in my bench, not only  as  any  other
MP, but as an African MP, one had to recall a song sung  by  Miriam  Makeba.
One had to recall that song because of the nature and manner in which  other
people wish to handle this debate. The title of the  song  is  This  is  the
story of how we begin to remember. With apologies to Miriam Makeba,  I  wish
to add to those lyrics. This is not only  the  story  of  how  we  begin  to
remember, but a  story  of  how  we  begin  to  remember  for  we  have  not
forgotten, but we have forgiven.

I am proud to be born of a people, an African people, who chose  to  forgive
the sinners, mass killers and mass murderers. We chose  to  forgive  because
we know that it is the responsibility of us, the  oppressed,  to  build  and
reconcile a deeply divided society. [Applause.] We do, however,  invite  all
South Africans to join us in this responsibility of reconciling our  nation.
But reconciliation is not a one-way street. There are those who will  choose
to have it as a one-way street. The silliness, the arrogance and  the  self-
seeking individuals and groupings  that  we  find  in  this  country,  self-
seeking individuals of no consequence like the hon Tony Leon, will never  at
any stage let us be cowed in our responsibilities to build this country.  We
will invite them  to  join  us  in  the  process  of  reconciliation;  their
silliness will not deter us.

The laws of this country do define the powers of the President. As with  all
citizens of this country, he enjoys no rights or  privileges  that  are  not
accorded to him by the laws of the state, the  Constitution.  The  power  to
pardon convicted prisoners, in  terms  of  which  the  President  acted,  is
conferred upon him by the  Constitution.  This  power  to  pardon  convicted
prisoners is not specific  to  South  Africa  alone.  It  is  one  which  is
recognised in many democratic countries.

The level of crime in this country is obviously a matter  of  grave  concern
to the public. It is, therefore, understandable that there may  be  anxiety,
confusion and strong reactions about the release of  persons  who  have  not
completed their sentences. Most notable have been the  vociferous  reactions
to  the  presidential  pardons  in  the  country  of  33  African  long-term
political prisoners. The fact that most of the 33 prisoners were  affiliated
to the liberatory forces and had had their amnesty request rejected  by  the
TRC has unleashed the predictable outpouring of criticism and condemnation.

The excellent work accomplished thus far by the TRC has  been  portrayed  by
others as being in jeopardy. Nothing could be further from  the  truth.  But
what all this  does  is  to  show  us  that  eight  years  after  our  first
democratic elections the country still has not healed  from  the  wounds  of
our past. While the backlash against these pardons  remains  unabated,  many
former freedom fighters and supporters of the national  liberation  struggle
are applauding the presidential pardons. Many of them remember  that  during
the TRC amnesty process former members of the repressive apartheid  security
forces who received amnesty enjoyed the  best  available  legal  assistance,
whilst former freedom fighters applying for amnesty  received  comparatively
minimal legal aid. This gross injustice and discrepancy was  even  noted  by
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission itself.

The President's decision  to  pardon  has  also  gone  a  long  way  towards
restoring the  morale  and  confidence  of  many  veterans  of  the  freedom
struggle who have noted and, consequently, become angered  by  the  generous
amnesties granted by the TRC to several high-profile former members  of  the
apartheid security  forces.  Many  of  these  security  force  members  were
involved in state-sponsored terrorism, torture and death  squad  activities.
Here again, by putting the concept of reconciliation before  the  people  of
this country, and hoping for a positive outcome, we are,  by  all  accounts,
further testing their limits of forgiveness.

The people's  tolerance  levels  were  again  tested  when  former  SA  Army
chemical  and  biological  warfare  expert,  Wouter  Basson,  was   recently
acquitted. Many, in particular the freedom  fighters,  regarded  this  as  a
travesty of justice.

Other interested parties that have recently  met  with  Minister  Maduna  to
discuss amnesty were the IFP and a group of other generals. The IFP  favours
a  form  of  amnesty  by  means  of  presidential  pardons  based   on   the
recommendations of a justice  panel.  The  apartheid  generals  have  stated
their need for amnesty for apartheid soldiers. It has  been  confirmed  that
the generals have been negotiating and that they and the ruling  party  have
sent the Government consolidated  proposals  on  the  general  amnesty.  The
PAC's president, president Mogoba,  who  has  consistently  called  for  the
release of jailed members of his party and Azanla, welcomed the pardons  and
thanked the President for having used his constitutional prerogative.

Let us also take cognisance of the tragic death of Martin  Whitaker  at  the
hands of  Dumisani  Ncamazana,  one  of  those  who  were  pardoned.  It  is
abhorrent and tragic and we extend our condolences to  the  Whitaker  family
and friends. Granting a pardon does not allow  one  to  guarantee  that  the
individual pardoned will not commit further  misdemeanours,  and  unforeseen
circumstances should not encourage paranoia. Ncamazana has sealed his  fate.
By blatantly flouting his second chance to be a free South African  citizen,
he chose to deny that gift to another, and he has to  face  the  consequence
of his heinous deed. I am proud ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, again you  are  now
transgressing. I think, on that issue, let us leave  it  to  the  courts  to
make a pronouncement.

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Thank you, Chairperson.  I  do  wish  to  refer  again  to
Miriam Makeba's song This is the story of how we begin  to  remember.  Those
who want to remind us of the evilness and heinous deeds and doings will  not
deter us from our march and movement forward to  build  and  reconcile  this
country, not even silly people like Tony Leon. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member,  before  you  leave
the podium ...

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Chairperson, I was referring to the hon Tony Leon. I  know
that it is wrong to insult arrogant people like him.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, on a point of order: The Chair instructed  the
hon member to come  back  here.  He  has  disregarded  that  and  has  shown
disrespect to the Chair. Before dealing with other points of order, I  think
he should be instructed to come back here. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, yes,  I  did.  The
hon  member  might  not  have  heard  me.  He  did  come   back,   but   ...
[Interjections.] Order! Hon members, when you make an apology,  make  it  in
good faith. Let it be a genuine apology. But if you withdraw part of  it  by
substituting additional comments,  then  the  apology  does  not  become  an
apology.

And we have a convention in this House that all members are  honourable  and
that must be  understood,  both  in  the  letter  and  in  the  spirit.  And
therefore I would like to request you to uphold that, because  in  doing  so
you are upholding one of the most fundamental  conventions  of  this  House.
This is the kind of role model that we expect our members of  Parliament  to
be  and  the   precedent   that   you   should   be   setting   for   future
parliamentarians. So I would like you please  to  understand  that  in  that
spirit; and if in that spirit, once again, you wish  to  refer  to  the  hon
member as ``hon member'' without supplementing it, I would appreciate it.

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Chairperson, I submit unconditionally to  the  appropriate
conventions of Parliament.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member.

Ms M SMUTS: Chairperson, it is as well that the hon Mashimbye,  amongst  his
other remarks, extended condolences to the survivors of Mr Martin  Whitaker,
since Ms Liesl De Villiers and her son have been  with  us  in  the  gallery
during this debate this afternoon.

I doubt that the Government fully understands the sense of shock induced  by
the manner and the scale of the presidential pardons, and it would  serve  a
purpose if all of Parliament would convey that shock to Government,  because
further ill-advised and one-sided pardons will  destroy  the  truth  process
with possible consequential effects on the rest  of  the  unique  compact  -
which has been here described - of the transition.

The fact is that this Government has seldom shown an  understanding  of  the
centrality of the victims and survivors to the truth  process,  and  to  the
morality and constitutionality  of  its  act.  This  has  been  demonstrated
repeatedly in respect of the reparations.

The Government has  seldom  shown  a  sense  of  obligation  to  honour  the
difficult transitional agreement of 1993 that there would be  amnesty  based
on such criteria as Parliament legislated. On  the  contrary,  the  hon  the
President and 36 other ANC leaders displayed disdain for the very terms  and
conditions of that law when they applied for a  blanket  indemnification  in
1997 without disclosing how they had broken the law.

The Government has, in fact, seldom demonstrated the respect due to the  TRC
as an institution. On the contrary, the hon the present  President  resisted
publication of its report in 1998 while the hon the Minister of Justice  has
been known to be rude to Archbishop Tutu.

For parliamentarians, it is a very different matter. May I say,  amongst  my
colleagues, when reparations remain unpaid, I too feel that I have  betrayed
the victims. It is Government that is in dereliction of its duty  to  put  a
proposal before us, but it is we who redrafted and passed the law in a  time
when MPs, across party lines, legislated strictly  under  the  Constitution.
Now, in those  days,  we  redrafted,  notwithstanding  resistance  from  the
ruling parties, old and new - they were then in  a  Government  of  National
Unity - and we did so on issues such as  the  holding  of  amnesty  hearings
behind closed doors. There are still many of us here -  the  hon  Johnny  de
Lange and the hon CornÃ© Mulder and me.

It was in order to meet the standards of the Constitution that  we  observed
the victim's right to know. That is the very right that was ignored  in  the
case of the pardons. We changed the law, as it had been tabled,  because  we
were convinced that victims' right to information, to access to  court,  and
to administrative justice were infringed  by  secrecy.  We  were  also,  the
others may remember, reminded by Frank  Kahn  that  common  law  and  common
sense dictate that openness discourages falsification  and  achieves  public
confidence.

Now, the public had lost confidence in the previous indemnity laws  when  we
were legislating this one. I regret to say that I believe that  the  current
crop of pardons is once again bringing the  process  into  disrepute.  Above
all, my colleagues will remember, we decided in the justice  committee  then
that it could not be correct or  constitutional  that  victims  should  find
out, after the fact, that someone had claimed and received an  amnesty  that
they may have wished to dispute. Now, it is not so with the  pardons,  where
the President relies on who-knows-what for  facts,  and  who-knows-what  for
the evaluation.

he openness of the TRC hearings achieved many other  results.  A  remarkable
case of reconciliation was the one achieved at a  fleeting  meeting  between
the Apla cadres who killed a group of students in the Heidelberg  Tavern  in
1993, and the mother of one of those students, Mrs Ginn Fourie. She made  it
her mission to try to get counselling for perpetrators,  because  there  was
an expressed need and because it is not wise to unleash trained  killers  on
society. It was on her behalf that I discussed her proposal with leaders  of
almost all of the parties here and with the TRC, which in  fact  included  a
recommendation to that effect in its report. Members will find  it  on  page
310 of volume 5. Needless to say,  nothing  came  of  the  idea  of  helping
perpetrators, just as nothing has come of reparations to date.

Did  the  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  and  the
President take into consideration the  wisdom  of  unleashing  killers  into
society? I think we know the answer.

The truth process, despite its very  many  shortcomings,  has  helped  South
Africans to achieve a kind of closure, but the pardons are  unravelling  the
integrity of the process. If they become back-door amnesties, and we  appeal
to the Minister to take care, or even a de facto blanket amnesty,  then  the
Government is in fact tearing up the law on the promotion of national  unity
and reconciliation. Perhaps that is exactly what it wants - I do not know  -
but we plead with them and implore them that the stakes are too  high.  What
we have achieved in our country is too important to be  threatened  by  ill-
advised and, especially, one-sided pardons. [Applause.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Smuts,  if  you  would  come  back
here again.

I think, in the early part of your speech, you made a  reference  that  this
Parliament once made laws strictly under the Constitution. The  implication,
as I understand it, being that  laws  subsequently  made  are  not  strictly
under the Constitution. [Interjections.]

Order! This is a very important  and  material  point  because  we  in  this
Parliament are meant to uphold the Constitution. We have taken  an  oath  to
do so. If there is an inference that the laws that are being  made  are  not
strictly under the Constitution, then it goes  to  a  very  significant  and
central point regarding the upholding of the Constitution.

So, I would like you to clarify that in order that no such inference can  be
drawn.

Hon Smuts, if you would take your seat.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, often in this House the  allegation  has  been
made that legislation which was being considered and  which  the  Government
wished to pass was unconstitutional, and would be found to  be  so.  At  the
moment,  the  Constitutional  Court  is  considering   amendments   to   the
Constitution  which  we   passed,   and   legislation   which   we   passed.
[Interjections.]

There is absolutely nothing unparliamentary about alleging that  actions  by
the President might well be unconstitutional, and that  measures  passed  by
Parliament might well be unconstitutional.

What the hon Ms Smuts said, I submit to you, is not unparliamentary at  all.
[Interjections.]

Ms M SMUTS: May I be allowed to ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, if the inference  is  made
- and this is what I would like the hon member at the podium to clear  up  -
that a substantial body of the law made by this House  and  passed  by  this
House does not conform strictly to  the  Constitution  ...  [Interjections.]
Because she said ... [Interjections.] The point I would like  to  make,  and
the words she used were that the laws made since then are not made  strictly
under the Constitution.

Now,  there  is  a  very  clear  inference  then  to   the   lack   of   the
unconstitutionality of a large body of the law. I would like the hon  member
to clarify that. If not, then I would like to look at the matter again,  and
come back and rule on that.

Ms M SMUTS: Chairperson, thank you for your further guidance.  What  I  said
was the following: That, in my experience in  the  previous  Parliament,  it
was first and foremost the desire of MPs, from whichever party,  to  achieve
constitutionality in what we did. It  follows  from  that  that  what  I  am
suggesting is that what is tabled by the executive  is  often  a  matter  of
discussion or dispute, but  is  sometimes  not  constitutional.  What  I  am
suggesting is that, in this  Parliament,  it  is  sometimes  the  case  that
members of a certain party will  not,  in  fact,  go  against  the  Bill  as
tabled. I  am,  after  all,  publicly  on  record  as  suggesting  that  the
Electronic Transactions Bill, just signed, is in  fact  not  constitutional.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member,  the  Chair  reserves  the
right  to  look  at  the  Hansard  and  to  look  at  this  matter  further.
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Mr  Chairperson,  I
should like to start by extending the Government's  and  my  condolences  to
the Whitaker family  and  their  loved  ones.  [Interjections.]  The  family
should accept that,  in  our  culture,  the  death  of  a  person  is  never
celebrated, no matter the cause thereof. We will never celebrate  the  death
of a person at the hands of another.

Having said so, we are here to address this issue once  again.  I  must  say
that I have not come across anything new  that  was  not  canvassed  in  the
debate when the hon the Leader of the  Opposition  tabled  a  question.  The
issue for me is indeed a very important one. It is governed  solely  by  the
Constitution,  and  the  Constitutional  Court  has  said   as   much.   The
Constitutional Court has said, in paragraph 10  on  page  715  of  the  BCLR
Report that, unlike the other powers of the President, the power  to  pardon
does not derive its authority from and is  not  dependent  upon  legislative
enactment.

I have heard hon members suggest that the President has undermined the  work
of the TRC. It is useful to  remember  that  the  TRC  was  established  and
functioned under a law. When one says that someone has undermined  something
that was happening under a law by acting  under  the  Constitution,  one  is
short of stating something that is very crazy, namely that the  Constitution
is subject to that law. [Interjections.] Those  hon  members  should  please
listen.

There is no way one can  actually  exercise  a  power  in  the  Constitution
correctly, and yet act unconstitutionally in  relation  to  a  law,  because
what one is saying then is  that,  in  that  respect,  the  Constitution  is
subject to that law. It is not. [Interjections.]

Secondly, ... [Interjections.] The hon member did not have to say  it.  That
is the inference we drew from what the hon member said.

Secondly, this  is  not  the  only  mode  through  which  prisoners  can  be
released. It is not. There are many others. We  have  in  excess  of  7  000
people  who  are  under  correctional  supervision  today.  We  have   them.
[Interjections.] We have many people who have been  released  on  parole  or
whose sentences have been reduced under the law, which is the  remission  of
sentences. [Interjections.]

One cannot say, when one is exercising these powers under the  law  and  the
Constitution, that one will indulge in gazing into a crystal  ball  and  say
that this person may commit a crime, and therefore,  the  person  cannot  be
released. One cannot do that. No system does this, and this one  will  never
be able to do so.
The best and the most that we guarantee is that once a person,  whoever  the
person is, has committed an offence, we set  the  hounds  of  the  law  upon
them. We unleash the hounds upon them. That is it. [Interjections.]

The hon member says  there  is  a  lack  of  transparency  in  the  process.
[Interjections.] There is not a  lack  of  transparency.  We  do  this  work
openly in the department. We do not sit at bus  ranks  or  railway  stations
when doing this work. [Interjections.] If by  transparency  the  hon  member
means that we must actually stand on the rooftops and  scream  that  we  are
about to exercise this power, and that people should  be  careful,  we  will
not do that.

The hon Tony Leon says that there  was  an  apparent  contradiction  between
what I said and what the President subsequently said. If  he  can  read,  he
will read this document, which I sent to the  President.  It  does  not  say
anywhere that the President must pardon these  33  people,  or  any  one  of
them, for political reasons.

I said openly that the President is entitled when exercising  this  power  -
and he is the only authority in this  country  that  exercises  this  power,
under the  Constitution.  When  exercising  this  power,  the  President  is
entitled to look at anything. He is not confined to what  the  Minister  for
Justice and Constitutional Development places before him.

When the President says that he took into account the fact  that  they  were
also freedom fighters, there is no contradiction between what I  have  said,
and what he said. Hon members should please accept that.

Then, regarding the Danster case, I want  to  state  categorically  that  we
have searched the records. We are not aware of any such application. If  the
hon member has the application somewhere, he should give it to us.  We  will
subject it to the same degree of scrutiny that we did with  respect  to  the
others.

The hon member suggested that there is back-door amnesty.  For  God's  sake,
there is no back-door  amnesty.  This  is  solely  in  accordance  with  the
Constitution, and is accepted  by  our  highest  court,  the  Constitutional
Court. [Interjections.]

There was reference to collective ANC applications for amnesty.  I  want  to
say that there is an element of mischief there,  or  a  tendency  to  forget
what was happening. Unless one knows  of  a  crime  that  was  committed  by
anyone who was on that list, they should accept what I am going to  say.  We
never applied for amnesty because we wanted to hide what  we  had  done.  We
are very proud of having fought apartheid, while those hon members sat  here
and supported it. [Interjections.] We are very proud. [Applause.]  We  shall
not apologise to anybody for that!

What we sought to do and what we stated explicitly was  to  encourage  other
parties also to come  forward  and  state  what  had  been  done  under  the
auspices of their leadership, in order to encourage people who  might  have,
in the process, committed gross violations of human rights and other  crimes
to also come forward. That was the sole intention. We encouraged members  of
the ANC and, in particular, uMkhonto weSizwe, to  come  forward  and  appear
before the TRC, by doing it that way.  It  was  a  very  difficult  task  to
perform, because some  of  them  were  saying:  ``Should  we  apologise  for
fighting apartheid?'' We said to them that that was not what was  happening.
We were promoting the  process.  Those  who  know  of  any  crime  that  was
committed by my President right down to myself,  the  little  armour-bearer,
can go to the nearest police station now and lay a charge.  [Interjections.]
Otherwise, shut up! [Interjections.]

We have been asked whether we are going to consult  anybody.  Imagine,  dear
sirs and madams, that we say that we are here to  consult  Limpho  Hani  and
her children about the application for amnesty by  those  who  killed  Chris
Hani, and then expect them to say: ``Please pardon them''.

Rev Meshoe, in particular, will remember that people, in the days  of  yore,
were screaming for the crucifixion of  an  innocent  person,  Jesus  Christ.
They were saying ``Sikhululele uBarabasi.'' [Release our Barabbas.]

Lastly ... No, this is not the last point. It cannot  be,  because  I  still
have a few seconds. It is useful to remember that there was never  any  snap
debate in the  apartheid  parliament  on  the  release  of  Barend  Strydom.
[Interjections.] Let me tell the hon member that we know of no  protest  now
against what he is doing. They are so  quiet  when  he  overtly  supports  a
person who allegedly committed the same crime  that  he  committed,  because
the  victims,  once  again,  of  the  attack  on   the   bus   were   black.
[Interjections.]

The last point I want to make is meant for Koos van der  Merwe.  One  cannot
interfere with court processes when the courts are, in  what  is  called  in
legal terms functus officio, which means  that  they  have  concluded  their
work. Pardons, in this instance, kicked in when  the  courts  had  concluded
their work. So, one could not interfere with the process. One could  not  go
in and say: ``I am Thabo Mbeki. I am here to  pardon  so-and-so.  Therefore,
stop the trial''.

That is not what happened here. [Interjections.] No, but that  is  what  was
implied. Again, we cannot say, as  this  Parliament,  that  people  must  no
longer apply for pardons. We cannot say so. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 19:02.
