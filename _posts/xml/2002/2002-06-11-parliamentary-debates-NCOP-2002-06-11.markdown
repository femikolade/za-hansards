                           STATEMENT OF CONDOLENCE

                          (The late Mr P R Mokaba)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson,  may  I  say  the  following  in
relation to the comrade whom we have just lost.  Comrade  Peter  Mokaba  was
born in 1959 in Mankweng in the Limpopo province. He was an activist from  a
very early age and was active in initiating  boycotts  at  schools,  to  the
extent that in his youth he already had to seek shelter in the mountains  in
order to avoid arrest.

In 1977 he was captured and charged  for  public  violence.  There  were  28
state witnesses who refused to testify against him and he  was  subsequently
acquitted. He was banned from  entering  schools  or  being  enrolled  at  a
school - I know Comrade Kader would be interested to hear this -  but,  this
notwithstanding, he continued to study and passed his matric.  At  the  time
of his death he was busy with his  studies,  trying  to  complete  a  second
master's degree.

In 1982 Comrade Peter was sentenced on a charge of arms possession and  sent
to Robben Island, where he spent a year. His conviction  and  sentence  were
set aside and he was subsequently  released.  He  was  always  a  loyal  and
dedicated member of the ANC,  a  powerful  orator,  a  person  who  had  the
courage of his convictions and  a  person  who  worked  very  hard  for  the
liberation of the people in this country and the  continent.  Comrade  Peter
Mokaba will be missed.

I do have a formal motion which I will put to  the  House  after  the  other
political parties have had an opportunity to speak on this matter.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, the death of any man brings sadness and  grief  to
family and friends. But the death of a young man standing on  the  threshold
of a promising political life, as did the late hon Peter  Mokaba,  leaves  a
void in the lives of those closely associated with him.

My party's profound condolences go to his family,  but  more  especially  we
sympathise with the political party he belonged to. The blow to the  ANC  is
immense, considering the fact that the late Peter Mokaba was  a  charismatic
public representative and a high-profile  member  of  the  party's  NEC.  No
party young in government wishes to lose a dynamic  young  member  from  its
ranks.

We join the Chief Whip in paying tribute to the late  Peter  Mokaba  and  in
expressing condolences to family, friends and the ANC.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the New NP wants to move that  the  Council
notes with sadness and deep regret the sudden  passing  away  of  member  of
Parliament Peter Mokaba and notes further the great contribution he made  to
our democracy. We wish to convey our sincere condolences to his  family  and
the ANC in this, their hour of bereavement.

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, in Zulu there is a saying: Ukufa kuyisela  ngoba
kudla silaza kudle fumuka. Sithi-ke kuyisela ukufa nxa  kusithathela  iqhawe
lethu ebeliselisha kangaka. [Death is a thief as it stole our hero  who  was
still young.]

We mourn the death of this son of the soil, a hero and a  cadre,  a  comrade
in arms. Peter Mokaba was indeed a revolutionary dedicated to  the  complete
emancipation of his people. He was a leader who was honest, frank and  open.
He was a leader who spoke his mind. He had the ability to stand  his  ground
and defend himself. His death was a huge loss, not only to  his  family  and
his political party, but also to the entire  nation,  particularly  at  this
tender age.

To his family, political party and  friends  we  say:  Akwehli  lungehlanga.
Mabalale ngenxeba bonke. [What has happened can never be  changed.  Everyone
must be consoled.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, on behalf  of  the  UDM  I  hereby  express  my
condolences following the untimely death of Comrade Peter  Mokaba.  We,  the
people of the Northern Province in particular, have lost a  great  deal  and
his deeds have left a challenge amongst us, especially the youth. He  was  a
young person who sacrificed his academic career as well as his life for  the
liberation of the oppressed majority in South Africa.

He was involved in the liberation struggle as  early  as  1976,  during  the
youth riots in Soweto,  and  could  not  proceed  with  his  law  degree  at
Turfloop, given the anarchical management of the black universities  by  the
apartheid government at the time. Those who went  to  Turfloop  will  recall
how the army and the police used to harass our students there.

We extend our sympathy and condolences to his parents, brothers and  sisters
and thank the family for their contribution to the role played by their  son
towards the advent of democracy in South Africa.

Mr  J  O  TLHAGALE:  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  hon  Deputy   President,
colleagues, it was with the greatest shock that we  heard  of  the  untimely
death of Comrade Peter Mokaba, who passed away over the weekend. I  did  not
know him personally, but I knew him  at  a  distance  as  an  outspoken  and
forthright person who believed in what he believed. I knew him as  a  person
who could say what he wanted to say regardless of who else said what.

I wish to extend the condolences of the UCDP to his family  circle  as  well
as to our friends in the ANC.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, on behalf of the ACDP, may  I  say  that  it  is
always sad when a young, attractive and promising life ends  prematurely.  I
personally had some contact with Mr Mokaba. I remember one occasion when  he
came over to London while I was ambassador there. The  newspaper  said  that
the young lion was coming to roar in London. I  arranged  a  lunch  for  him
with all the editors of the television stations and  major  newspapers,  and
Mr Mokaba could not have been more charming and engaging. The next  day  the
headline in the Financial Times was: ``And the lion came and lay  down  with
the lamb,'' the lamb being me. So there we are!

He was an attractive young man and we associate  ourselves  fully  with  the
remarks of the Chief Whip and our hon colleagues. Our hearts and prayers  go
out to the Mokaba family, particularly to his parents and children.

Debate concluded.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                          (The late Mr P R Mokaba)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I note that the hon Van  Niekerk
put forward a motion. May I, with the permission of  this  House,  amend  my
motion to incorporate the elements raised in the hon Van  Niekerk's  motion.
I see that I do have the hon member's permission.

I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock and profound  sadness  the  untimely  death  of  the
       honourable Peter Ramoshoane Mokaba, who passed away on 9 June 2002;


  (2) recognises that  Peter  Mokaba  was  a  South  African  patriot  who,
       throughout his  life,  demonstrated  a  profound  commitment  to  the
       liberation of the people of our country and the continent of Africa;
  (3) remembers him as a principled person  who  had  the  courage  of  his
       convictions;


  (4) recalls that, as president of the South African  Youth  Congress  and
       the African National Congress  Youth  League  and  a  member  of  the
       National Executive Committee of the African National Congress he  was
       a robust, fearless, loyal and dedicated cadre who lived by the words,
       "rather die next to the enemy than let him pass";


  (5) acknowledges the dynamic contribution that the honourable Mokaba made
       to Parliament since the election of the first  democratic  Parliament
       in  1994,  during  which  time  he  served  as  Deputy  Minister   of
       Environmental Affairs and Tourism and as Chairperson of  the  Ad  Hoc
       Committee on Powers and Privileges of Parliament, in which  positions
       he served with dedication;


  (6) believes  that  he  leaves  a  legacy  that  epitomises  heroism  and
       dedicated service and that his untimely death has robbed South Africa
       of a great  son  who  at  his  tender  age  still  had  a  tremendous
       contribution to make to the reconstruction  and  development  of  our
       nation; and


  (7) expresses its condolences to the entire Mokaba family.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  L  Mushwana):  In  conclusion,  on
behalf of the presiding officers, I want to echo  the  sentiments  expressed
by members in this honourable House and associate us with the  motion  moved
by the Chief Whip. I undertake to make sure that the sentiments  and  motion
are transmitted to the Mokaba family in due course.  I  now  call  upon  hon
members to stand and observe a moment of silence  for  the  late  hon  Peter
Mokaba.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section  65  of  the  Constitution,  all
members standing.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Before  proceeding
with questions, we will deal with the first motion on  the  Order  Paper  as
printed in the name of the Chief Whip, as it is a matter of urgency.

                        SUSPENSION OF JOINT RULE 154

  That the Council, following joint briefings and deliberations, agrees  to

   PARLIAMENTARY ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE CRITICAL TASKS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL
                ACHIEVEMENT OF AFRICAN UNITY AND DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Chairperson, hon  members,  I  thank
you for the opportunity to discuss this  very  important  issue.  Ninety-six
years ago the founding father of the  ANC,  Pixley  Seme,  speaking  in  New
York, said:


  The brighter day is rising upon  Africa  ...  Yes,  the  regeneration  of
  Africa belongs to this new  and  powerful  period.  The  regeneration  of
  Africa means that a new and unique civilisation is soon to  be  added  to
  the world.

Sadly, the vision that Pixley Seme expounded did  not  materialise.  We  are
all acutely conscious of the  systematic  impoverishment  of  our  continent
caused  by  slavery,  colonialism,  the  Cold   War,   neocolonialism,   the
weaknesses of the political and economic policies of many of  our  countries
and the nature of the world economic system.

The stark reality today is that despite the great  potential  our  continent
has, we are still one of the poorest continents in the world.  Let  us  look
at some of the facts. The number of Africa's  poor  has  grown  relentlessly
and Africa's share of the world's absolute poor increased from  25%  to  30%
in the 1990s. Africa's share of world trade has  plummeted  since  1960.  It
now accounts for less than 2% of world trade and, if South Africa  is  taken
out of the equation, the figure for  the  rest  of  Africa  is  much  lower.
Africa is the only region to  have  seen  investments  and  savings  decline
after 1970. The savings rates in many African countries are  the  lowest  in
the world.

In 1997, Africa's debt was estimated to be $159 billion  and  by  1999  this
increased to $201 billion. We are faced with the  reality  that  outstanding
external debts in many African countries exceed  the  entire  GDP  of  those
countries,  and  debt  service  requirements  exceed  25%  of  total  export
earnings. Overseas development assistance has dropped more  than  one  fifth
in real terms since 1992.

Despite the fact that many of our countries have taken  steps  to  create  a
climate conducive to direct foreign investment, the  reality  is  that  very
little foreign direct investment has flowed sufficiently to Africa.

Diseases such  as  HIV/Aids,  malaria  and  tuberculosis  continue  to  have
serious negative  consequences  on  our  continent.  Power  consumption  per
person is the lowest in the world. Tokyo has more telephones than the  whole
of Africa. Less than half of 1% of all Africans have used the internet.

Surely we cannot continue with this order of things. Surely Africa with  its
potential deserves better and our leaders  must  respond  to  the  challenge
that African people are posing to us.  We  want  to  believe  that  the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development, Nepad, is our response to  this  stark
reality.

Nepad is a holistic integrated sustainable development  initiative  for  the
economic and social development  of  Africa.  It  is  a  pledge  by  African
leaders based on a common vision and a firm and shared conviction that  they
have a pressing duty to the African  people  to  eradicate  poverty  and  to
place our countries, both  individually  and  collectively,  on  a  path  of
sustainable  growth  and  development  and  at  the  same  time  participate
actively in the world economy and body politic.

The  initiative,  which  is  an  African  initiative,  is  anchored  on  our
determination to extricate ourselves and the continent from the  malaise  of
underdevelopment and exclusion in a globalising  world.  It  is  an  African
call for a new relationship of constructive partnership between  Africa  and
the international community to overcome the development chasm  that  I  have
just referred to. The partnership is to  be  founded  on  a  realisation  of
common interest, obligations and commitments and  on  benefit  and  equality
between Africa and the rest of the world.

It is clear that we will succeed in achieving our objectives if we draw  the
necessary conclusions from our past experiences, utilise all  our  available
resources and forge partnerships that are mutually beneficial. It  is  clear
too that Nepad is seeking  fundamental  transformation  regarding  political
and economic governance. Given the realities of our continent,  we  have  no
illusions  about  the  difficulties  and  indeed  opposition   from   vested
interests that we  will  face  in  implementing  the  objectives  of  Nepad.
However, we must stress that Nepad is  about  genuine  partnership  and  not
paternalism, as happened during the earlier period. We also  start  from  an
understanding that Nepad is not an event but a process.

We are happy to note that support for Nepad has  come  from  many  quarters:
the G8, the Nordic countries, the United Nations,  China  and  countries  in
Latin America. We also believe that Nepad in the end will succeed  if  there
is partnership between government and civil society,  because  without  this
partnership Nepad will not be able to achieve the lofty ideals  that  it  is
putting forward.

I am happy to note that just last week there was  a  very  successful  World
Economic Forum meeting in Durban which concentrated  on  Nepad.  There  were
750 delegates representing 42 countries, and  it  was  very  encouraging  to
note that many of the top companies in the world and in South Africa  signed
a petition, a declaration, in support of Nepad. I  am  also  happy  to  note
that many of the top leaders of big  business,  internally  and  externally,
have indicated that they see Africa as a wonderful opportunity  to  start  a
new relationship based on a programme determined  by  Africans  and  not  by
others at the expense of our own interests and priorities.

I want to say that the Nepad heads of state  and  government  implementation
committee  is  meeting  in  Rome  today.  The  implementation  committee  is
composed of three states from each of the  five  OAU  regions.  It  includes
South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, Ethiopia,  Mauritius,  Rwanda,  Nigeria,
Senegal, Mali, Cameroon, Gabon, the Republic of the  Congo,  Egypt,  Algeria
and Tunisia.

The purpose of the meeting will be to finalise  the  detailed  programme  of
action of the Nepad. Detailed and concrete  documents  have  been  developed
over the last 18 months for consideration by the heads of state in  each  of
the priority areas of  the  Nepad,  constituting  the  first  phase  of  the
implementation of the Nepad.

Furthermore, the meeting will be utilised to  prepare  for  the  interaction
with the G8 meeting that will take place  in  Kananaskis  in  Canada  on  27
June, where the G8 African action plan will also be  discussed.  We  welcome
the G8 action plan but we believe that they have left out certain  important
aspects, such as market access, infrastructure  development  and  the  whole
issue of cancelling the debt of the mostly highly indebted poor countries.

This meeting will also prepare for the African Union summit that  will  take
place in Durban, South  Africa,  on  8-10  July  and  the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development,  which  will  take  place  in  Johannesburg,  South
Africa, at the end of August.

President Mbeki, in his state of the nation address in February 2002,  said,
and I quote:


  We shall continue to challenge a pessimism that expects Africa to fail in
  any  of  its  endeavours,  and  the  undeclared  doctrine  of  collective
  punishment against all Africans that seems to come into effect  when  one
  or some among our leaders stumble.

President Mbeki was putting emphasis on what I  believe  is  fundamental  to
our new partnership  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  We  will  not  accept
conditionalities  based  on  wrongdoings  or  problems  in  one  country  or
another. Nepad must be supported on the basis of what it is putting  forward
and of its interests, mutually beneficial for Africa and  the  rest  of  the
world.

I want to believe that we do not need to be taught about democracy.  Indeed,
the Nepad implementation committee  summit  meeting  in  Abuja  adopted,  as
early as March 2002, a draft report on  good  governance  and  democracy  as
well as  an  African  peer  review  mechanism.  The  draft  report  on  good
governance and democracy spells out in detail  commitments  and  obligations
such as the strengthening of the democratic process, the promotion  of  good
governance, the protection of human  rights,  press  freedom  and  enhancing
institutional capacity.

New  initiatives  worth  underscoring  are  the  proposal  to  establish   a
portfolio in the AU of a  commissioner  to  be  responsible  for  democracy,
human rights and good governance, and proposals to expand the  OAU  position
on unconstitutional changes of government to include dealing  with  patently
undemocratic and unconstitutional behaviour as well as gross  violations  of
human  rights  by  governments  in  power.   It   includes   proposals   for
strengthening the commission and the court on human and people's rights.

The African peer review mechanism that we are proposing has as  its  purpose
to ensure that African ownership of its development agenda is controlled  by
Africa. Its purpose is to identify, evaluate and disseminate best  practice;
to monitor progress towards agreed goals; to  use  peer  review  to  enhance
adoption and implementation of best practice; and to  identify  deficiencies
and capacity gaps and recommend approaches to addressing these issues.

From what I have said, I hope it  is  clear  that  Africa  is  committed  to
consolidating and expanding democracy and human  rights  protection  on  our
continent. But it is a programme that must be run by Africans based  on  our
programme that we ourselves  have  determined.  In  terms  of  economic  and
corporate governance, excellent proposals are being made, such as a code  of
good practice on transparency in monetary and financial policies, a code  of
good practice  on  fiscal  transparency  and  best  practice  for  budgetary
transparency.  It  is  clear,  therefore,  that  we  as  Africans  will  now
determine how we interact with developed and  developing  countries  on  the
basis of priorities identified by ourselves.

On the basis of what I  have  said,  the  year  2001  is  one  of  the  most
important in the history of South Africa's foreign policy,  and  indeed  for
the whole of Africa. Future generations will look back on this year  as  one
of  the  defining  moments  in  Africa's  history.  At  the  heart  of   the
continental effort is the need to position  our  continent  structurally  to
face the new challenges, to take advantage of the opportunities  brought  by
the changing political and economic environment and to prevent  the  further
marginalisation of Africa.

Nepad is the programme for economic and  social  development.  However,  for
Nepad to succeed, we need strong and appropriate institutions. The  OAU  has
played a very important role since its founding 39 years ago.  When  it  was
founded, the founding fathers said that the purpose of the OAU should be  to
promote the unity and solidarity of the African states and to intensify  co-
operation and efforts to achieve a better life for  the  people  of  Africa.
Clearly, since the OAU's founding in 1963, it has played an invaluable  role
in ending colonialism and  the  system  of  apartheid.  However,  today  the
challenge is more economic, and therefore we have to transform the OAU  into
a new structure, and that new structure is the African Union.

I believe that the African Union will deepen unity and deal  comprehensively
with  political  and  economic  matters   affecting   the   continent.   The
establishment of  the  AU  represents  a  continuation  of  the  Pan-African
movement, which is aimed at consolidating the unity of African  states.  The
Constitutive Act of the African Union commits the OAU and all of  us,  among
other things, to promoting sustainable economic  development;  to  face  the
difficult challenges of the often marginalising forces of globalisation;  to
promoting  popular   participation   and   building   partnerships   between
government and all sectors of civil society, in particular women and  youth;
to promoting  and protect democracy, good governance and the  rule  of  law;
and to promoting and protecting human and people's rights. Indeed, the  NCOP
and the National Assembly must play a leading  role  in  ensuring  that  the
lofty ideals of the Constitutive Act do become a reality and do  not  remain
mere words on paper.
An  important  element  of  achieving  sustainable  development  and  ending
poverty on our continent is conflict resolution. I  am  happy  to  say  that
both within the  proposed  new  structures  of  the  AU  and  in  SADC,  new
institutions have been proposed which will  now  set  up  an  AU  peace  and
security council, consisting of 15 heads of state who will meet at  head  of
state level, ministerial level and ambassadorial level. I believe that  this
will make a fundamental impact on our attempts  to  prevent  conflicts  and,
where conflicts happen, to prevent their escalating.

There is also an idea to set up a council of the wise, and I am  not  saying
that this House alone should look at that. All South  Africans  should  look
at whom we should suggest to serve on a council of the wise.

I am happy that we will host the inaugural of AU summit in South  Africa  in
July 2002. This will be a very important moment for us because  the  way  in
which the AU functions in the first year will determine  whether  the  lofty
ideals  that  I  have  referred  to  become  a  continuing  reality  on  our
continent.

Let me now turn to the subject matter in a different context.  What  is  the
parliamentary role in addressing  the  critical  tasks  for  the  successful
achievement of African unity and development? It is clear from what  I  have
said that no plans for  the  development  of  Africa  and  for  the  African
Renaissance can succeed if there is no partnership  between  government  and
civil society. The hon members of this House, as elected representatives  of
our people, must ensure that they interact with all sectors of our  society,
to get them to understand not only the importance of Nepad and the OAU,  but
also how they are going to contribute to making Nepad a success.  Our  whole
commitment  to  working  harder  in  the  context  of  Africa,  and   indeed
specifically in the context of Southern Africa, becomes  very  important.  I
hope that the NCOP  will  play  a  major  role  in  interacting  with  civil
society, including the very important private sector and trade  unions,  and
will ensure that the reality of Nepad and the AU is understood by all.
Hon members are, of course, going to be  participating  in  the  Pan-African
Parliament,  which  has  been  classified  as  a  political  and  democratic
institution which will represent the peoples  of  all  African  states.  Its
members will symbolise the  democratic  will  of  all  the  peoples  of  our
continent. As stated in the Constitutive  Act  of  the  African  Union,  the
parliament should ensure the full participation of African  peoples  in  the
development and economic integration of the  continent.  Each  member  state
will be represented by five parliamentarians, two of whom will  have  to  be
female, being representative  of  the  political  spectrum  of  that  member
state.

As such, the Pan-African Parliament has a role to play in the  creation  and
the maintenance of  political  and  social  stability,  strong  support  for
democratic ideals, macroeconomic stability, respect for  the  rule  of  law,
respect  for  gender  equality  and,  finally,  efficient,  competitive  and
supportive infrastructure. This makes it clear that the NCOP cannot just  be
a spectator while the process unfolds. It has to become an important  player
in the  whole  process  that  the  South  African  Parliament  is  going  to
undertake in terms of the role of parliamentarians in the next few years.

Hon  members  are  aware  of  the  fourth  report  of  the   South   African
parliamentary working group on the African Union, which  has  made  specific
suggestions on how parliamentarians can contribute. I  hope  that  the  NCOP
will not be left out of this process and will  play  a  major  role  in  the
African parliamentary process and the parliamentary  working  group  on  the
African Union.

In conclusion, let me quote President Luthuli, who said, as early as 1961:


  Let me invite Africa to cast her eyes beyond the past and to some  extent
  the present, with their woes and tribulations, trials and  failures,  and
  some successes, and  see  herself  an  emerging  continent,  bursting  to
  freedom through the shell of centuries of selfdom.

I want to believe that, given the  circumstances  now,  internationally  and
nationally, we  can  confidently  proclaim  the  21st  century  the  African
century. We do so because there is a new generation of African  leaders  who
are  willing  to  accept  their  responsibilities  and  leadership  role  to
struggle for and to achieve our African revival. The long walk to peace  and
prosperity in Africa has commenced with the first  major  steps,  Nepad  and
the AU. I hope and pray that the NCOP will play a  very  important  role  in
this process. [Applause.]

Nkk  J  N  VILAKAZI:  Sihlalo  ohloniphekileyo,  isihloko  esikhuluma  ngaso

(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, the topic we are discussing in this NCOP  of
South Africa is very important to all of us in Africa.

Firstly, we would like to thank  the  President  of  South  Africa,  who  is
trying diligently  to  unite  the  whole  of  Africa  in  the  economic  and
developmental spheres. This will  be  fulfilled  by  the  unity  of  African
countries that want to be part of this, at this level of African Union.

We all know that here in our country we have different  classes.  There  are
those who are highly educated, they have money and they are  very  rich.  We
also have those who are rich in knowledge and who earn good salaries.  These
people live well, although they are not rich. We also  have  those  who  are
heavily burdened, but able to support their families, although they are  not
rich. These people struggle hard in life. We also have those  who  are  poor
and unemployed. Usually their families display  bad  characteristics.  Their
children do not grow up well, their minds are not  well  nourished  or  they
are paralysed, depending on the level of poverty which  their  families  are
facing. Some suffer from  different  illnesses,  while  others  die  because
their parents are poor.

There are different levels of poverty in Africa. We hear on  the  radio  and
we see on television people and children  who  suffer  from  starvation  and
diseases caused by hunger.

Aids has come to finish it off, especially  in  poor  communities  it  kills
everything. That is why we  applaud  our  President  for  promoting  African
unity and also for promoting wealth and development in the whole of  Africa.
We also thank presidents of other African countries  who  are  dedicated  to
working together with our President in fulfilling the dream of unity.]

Nksz B N DLULANE: Mhlali-ngaphambili, ndiphakamisa isilungiso: ilusizi  into
yokuba kungabikho  mntu  utolikayo  xa  sithetha  iilwimi  zethu.  [Ms  B  N
DLULANE: Chairperson, I am raising a point of order: It is sad not  to  have
interpretation when we speak our languages.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I thank the hon  member  for  pointing
that out, although it is not a point of order. We will  look  into  it.  The
hon member Mrs Vilakazi may proceed.

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Ukuze lo mbhidlango ube  impumelelo,  kubalulekile  ukuthi
kulolongwe ikomiti  elihamba  phambili  kulo  mbhidlango  kanye  nawo  wonke
amakomiti akhethiweyo ukuhola lo mbhidlango. Amakomiti  kudingeke  azi  lezi
zindawo ezikulo mbhidlango ngokuthi ahlangane nazo  kuxoxiswane,  kudingidwe
izinkinga ukuze kuvezwe amasu namatulo azokwenza lolu bumbano  lube  nenzuzo
kuze kuthi nalabo abangangenile embhidlangweni bazimisele ukungena ukuze  i-
Afrika yonke igcine isikwazi ukuzikhulisela umnotho,  igcine  seyithuthukile
jikelele.

Ibhange lomhlaba i-IMF sonke siyawazi umsebenzi wayo, siyowazi kangcono  uma
sekukhona lolu bumbano. Ukujikeleza kula mazwe kuyosiza  amakomiti  aqondene
nokuthola ulwazi olungasiza ekuhlelweni nasekwenzeni  amalungiselelo  namasu
okulungisa  izimo  ngendlela  efaneleyo.   Okunye   okubalulekile   okudinga
amakomiti akwenze ukuvikela ukuthula. [Kwaphela isikhathi.] (Translation  of
Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: For this campaign to succeed, it is important to train  a
committee that will lead other elected committees, and also  this  campaign.
The committees should know the  countries  that  are  taking  part  in  this
campaign. They should visit them so that they can discuss  things  and  find
solutions to problems, come up with a solution that will make this  unity  a
profitable experience. That will attract even those who  did  not  join  the
unity so that the whole of Africa will be able to develop its  economy,  and
eventually become a developed continent.

We all know the function of the IMF, but we will  know  it  better  once  we
have unity. By visiting these countries  the  committees  will  be  able  to
acquire knowledge that  can  help  in  making  preparations  and  developing
strategies to do things in the appropriate manner.

Another important thing that committees need to do is  defend  peace.  [Time
expired.]]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson,  Ms  Dlulane  was  highlighting  an  important
point. Other members did not hear what Mrs Vilakazi was saying. There is  no
interpreting for people who speak African languages.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The point has  definitely  been  taken
and I have passed on the message to the Secretary to look into that.

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon members, ladies and gentlemen,  while  Nepad
is a pledge by African leaders to place their countries,  both  individually
and collectively, on a path of sustainable growth  and  development  and  to
participate actively in the world economy, the role and task of the  African
Parliament and the African Union are not clear.

The need for African unity and an African Parliament  is  indispensable  for
the continent's economic development.  Whilst  globalisation  has  increased
the cost of Africa's ability to compete, we in the ANC hold  the  view  that
managed  integration  presents  the  best  prospect  for   future   economic
prosperity  and  poverty  reduction.  We  are  not  unmindful  that  greater
integration has also led to further marginalisation of our continent.

The ANC has expressed its views on this subject well in  Umrabulo  No  5  of
1998. ANC MP Rob Davies explained that the ANC had taken a  policy  decision
to engage proactively with globalisation and  to  look  for  the  beneficial
reinsertion of our continent as presenting both opportunities  and  threats,
while recognising that we have strengths and  weaknesses  in  engaging  with
globalisation. The contention of my presentation before this House  is  that
only a highly unified  African  Union  and  parliament  can  negotiate  this
beneficial insertion of our continent into the global economy.

The question members of this House may pose is: Why is there a need  for  an
African Union or parliament? The  ministerial  declaration  adopted  at  the
World Trade Organisation in November last year is of major significance  for
developing countries in general and for this continent in particular.

In agricultural trade,  for  example,  subsidies  on  agricultural  products
produced in developed countries are now estimated to be worth more than  two
thirds of the  Gross  National  Product  of  Africa.  Moreover,  instead  of
declining in importance, these subsidies have been growing in significance.

For  developing  countries,  and  our  continent  in  particular,  the  most
critical question is trade and the removal of barriers to access markets  in
developed countries in products where our continent is competitive or  could
become so.

Only a sophisticated and unified continent can negotiate an  improvement  in
terms of trade in global fora  such  as  the  World  Trade  Organisation.  A
single lobby group for this continent would have more muscle  and  be  in  a
better position to improve its bargaining power when  negotiating  with  the
developed countries.

A single African Union would increase the possibility  of  some  reforms  in
the global trading system, potentially to  the  benefit  of  the  developing
countries.

Only large and powerful lobby groups such as the African  Union  would  have
the capacity in international  fora  to  address  the  distortion  in  world
commodity markets  that  are  created  by  high  tariffs  and  subsidies  in
developed economies.

An African Parliament or Union would  be  taken  more  seriously  in  global
negotiations on trade. Currently, the demands  of  developing  countries  to
rebalance  a  fundamentally  inequitable  global  trading  system  are   not
hegemonic in shaping the negotiation process at  the  WTO.  Only  large  and
powerful lobby groups such as the African Union or Parliament can state  our
case.

We are witnessing a change in the terrain of  our  struggle.  Our  continent
shall overcome. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Regarding  the  concern  that
there was no interpreting service, the Secretary and the  Table  staff  have
assured me that the matter is receiving attention.

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson and hon Deputy Minister, the  desire  for  African
unity has a long-standing history which can be  traced  to  the  continental
revolt against colonialism.  It  culminated  at  the  end  of  the  previous
century in South Africa becoming truly independent.

It  is  thus  an  indigenous  perspective,  reflecting  a  very   particular
economic, political, social and cultural integration between the states  and
peoples of our continent. Peace, security and  political  co-operation  will
lie at its heart, but it is economic integration  which  will  be  the  true
heartbeat of a lasting and successful union. This  was  even  basic  to  the
Cape to Cairo vision of the archcolonialist Cecil  Rhodes.  It  will  remain
the top priority for Parliament to address.

A growing democratic culture is seen  to  underpin  economic  reform.  While
parliamentary democracy is not enough to deliver  economic  development,  it
does,  however,  offer  mechanisms  which  are  adapted  to   peaceful   and
sustainable, albeit gradual, development.

The  desire  for  unity  is  not  unique  to  latter-day  Africa.   Numerous
international examples exist, such as the USA, the Chinese,  the  USSR,  now
departed,  our  own  federal  state,  and  the  United  Kingdom.  All  these
unification processes came about, not peacefully, but as a result of  force.
The EU is an exception, and the reason  for  this  contrahistorical  process
will no doubt be found in those overarching economic  advantages  that  have
made the union irresistible, despite numerous nationalistic objections.

Individual parliaments had to  exhibit  leadership  and  vision  to  achieve
admission to and compliance with these unions. These parliaments  were  able
to convince their voters of the desirability  to  be  judged  by  norms  and
institutions which may be different from their own domestic traditions.

Nepad's emphasis on good political and economic governance, including  plans
to develop a peer  review  mechanism,  are  among  the  features  that  have
attracted the interest of the international community. The decision  of  the
Commonwealth, including Presidents Mbeki and Obasanjo, to  suspend  Zimbabwe
from the councils of the Commonwealth is a  good  example  of  what  African
leaders and parliaments will be required to do if  they  are  serious  about
achieving unity and development in the  interests  of  the  continent  as  a
whole.
Parliaments will also have to prioritise not only the moral  questions,  but
the critical issues which will be at the basis of  successful  co-operation,
including the achievement of  stringent  debt  ratios,  customs  agreements,
labour standards, standardisation of produce, improved infrastructure, etc.

With South Africa being by far the most advanced economy on  the  continent,
it will be easy for us to dominate  the  rest  of  the  continent  on  every
level. The challenge Parliament faces is  to  find  compromises  which  will
work for South Africa, but also, as has  been  said,  for  Mali  or  Burkina
Faso.

Parliaments must accommodate the  need  for  a  differentiated  approach  to
address  existing  inequalities.  Parliaments  have  also  been  given   the
authority by the electorate to set the rules for the orderly  management  of
society and to hold governments accountable for delivering.

As elected people, we must ensure that the Government uses its resources  to
inform our constituencies about the purpose and  benefits  of  unity  across
our borders. Otherwise,  there  will  be  no  such  thing  as  a  pro-people
parliament nor commitment to further ideals such as the African Union.

In considering the role of Parliament, it is also essential to  address  the
role of opposition. The effect  of  opposition  criticism  is  to  correlate
government policy and public opinion on issues which have direct bearing  on
the life and welfare of the people.  On  the  issue  of  African  unity  and
advancement, the hon Colin Eglin had this to say:


  The challenge facing Africa in the  new  millennium  is  a  socioeconomic
  challenge of development, so that poverty can be rolled back, so that the
  countries and peoples of Africa  can  play  a  more  meaningful  part  in
  shaping and sharing in the world economy.

As part of the African political landscape, we want to play our  proper  and
meaningful role.

Lastly, it is probably going to take  two  generations  or  more  before  we
begin to function as a union. Let  us  take  that  time  to  get  it  right.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, the first imperative of our  parliamentary  role
is for us to be the successful and effective Parliament that indeed we  are,
fulfilling the custodianship  of  the  constitutional  values  we  swear  to
uphold in their entirety and without compromise. In other words,  we  are  a
role  model,  a  society  with  principles  and  values   worth   emulating.
Parliament should be seen in Africa and the world  to  be  the  carrier  and
guarantor of human  rights  and  responsibilities  that  is  responsive  and
sensitive to the rights and interests of minorities and majorities alike.

Parliament should retain its  constructive  and  critical  faculty,  without
which real improvement in society is not possible. Our parliamentary  system
is not necessarily for export, but the universal democratic values  of  free
men and women that underpin our Parliament certainly are. We all  know  that
Africa and the world are watching us, so the role model  of  a  successfully
functioning  parliament  is  absolutely  paramount.  If   we   discard   our
constitutional values as soon as we cross  the  Limpopo  or  enter  an  Arab
tent, we will not be useful to anyone, let alone ourselves.

People must know that when they meet South Africans they are dealing with  a
fiercely free and independent people. The Government is not Parliament,  and
vice versa. We  in  the  legislature  can  play  a  real  role  in  conflict
resolution,   reconciliation,   election   monitoring,    capacity-building,
mentoring, and generally supporting, understanding  and  encouraging  others
on the road to democracy, and learning from them, may I say.

Furthermore, we can give moral  support  to  parliaments  to  promote  their
independence from their own executives, for a start. It is  not  enough  for
Parliament  to  be  democratic  and  representative;  we  also  need  to  be
effective custodians of liberty, freedom, oversight  and  transparency,  and
the watchdogs of good governance.
Around the world and in Africa,  Botswana  is  a  good  example.  The  freer
societies are, the more successful they are generally.  The  difficult  part
is entrenching the  values  and  principles  of  sustainable  and  effective
democracy. The easy part is erecting buildings and  structures,  and  having
media events. The world has seen  all  that  before  and  they  remain  very
cynical. We must encourage others and reward those that  share  our  values.
We must be welcoming to those that do,  and  reject  those  governments  and
parliaments that subvert and violate the values in  which  we  believe,  for
example, that rogue state, Zimbabwe,  that  is  currently  looting  its  own
population.

Corruption is rife in Africa. The test for corruption is not that it  occurs
and that people are susceptible. The test is: how does  parliament  and  the
state act when it does occur, and what is the  preventative  machinery  that
is  in  place?  In  other  words,  in  the  South  African  Parliament,  and
parliaments in Africa, crime must not pay.

I am very proud of this Parliament, of what it has achieved and what it  can
do. I think that we as members of Parliament can play a very  real  role  in
reaching out to our brothers and sisters in  Africa,  and  helping  in  this
great enterprise onto which the President has set this nation. [Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I read in the Volksblad of this morning on  the
Internet an article by Maretha Maartens in which she says:


  Ons het denkers gekry wat met visioenêre denke na die res van Afrika kyk.
  Hierdie land word gereken  as  'n  leier  op  die  gebied  van  vreedsame
  onderhandeling en bemiddeling.

Verder sê sy: [She goes on to say:]


  Die mense van die land leer mekaar eindelik oor kultuurgrense  heen  ken.
  Dag vir dag beweeg ons nou nader na die warm hart van Afrika, wat eintlik
  tussen mense se ribbes sit.

What I want to say is that when we  talk  about  people  and  thinkers  with
vision for Africa, Nepad is a signal from Africa to the rest  of  the  world
that the people of Africa have a vision for  our  continent,  and  have  the
pride, potential and the will to kickstart the  revival  of  our  continent.
But to do so, we need both the material and moral  support  of  America  and
the G8 countries. The support from big business for Nepad so  far  has  been
very encouraging.

The nations of Africa will now be holding  their  collective  breath  for  a
positive outcome  from  the  coming  G8  summit  in  Canada.  Nepad  is  the
socioeconomic development blueprint for the AU to implement its  objectives.
The focus in Nepad is on the role of the heads of state, but yet  the  tasks
listed under Nepad's democracy and  governance  initiative  are  mainly  the
responsibility of Parliament. The tasks include strengthening political  and
administrative   frameworks   and   promoting    democracy,    transparency,
accountability, integrity, respect for human rights and  the  rule  of  law.
The strengthening of parliamentary oversight, participatory  decision-making
and combating corruption are the priority areas in this regard.

Collective resolve and action among heads of state alone are  not  going  to
solve Africa's problems. They are not, in Maretha Maarten's  words,  however
good they are, the only visionary thinkers and the only people  who  have  a
vision for Africa. Those of  us  in  the  legislatures  and  Parliaments  of
Africa also have a very significant role to play.

The heads of state alone will not build African unity  or  democracy,  which
are necessary conditions for sustainable development.  Parliaments  need  to
give serious consideration to the development of  a  national  understanding
of the Nepad initiative. Our Constitution  and  political  system  in  South
African require that policy issues be resolved only on the basis  of  shared
participation and responsibility between the legislature and the executive.

Consultation at crucial stages of the Nepad initiative,  in  order  to  give
the legislature  an  early  opportunity  to  comment  on  its  content  was,
unfortunately, somewhat lacking. Parliament must now place greater  emphasis
on the use of report-backs by the executive  to  enable  it  to  fulfil  its
constitutional responsibilities  for  the  review  and  oversight  of  Nepad
policies and programmes.

There are certain specific issue areas with a role for Parliament in  Nepad.
Regarding legislative organisation and procedures, we will have to  look  at
our current committee system and see whether that still fits  in  with  what
is going to be required of us in playing a constructive role as far  as  the
Nepad initiative is concerned. Mechanisms of  good  governance  include  the
need to strengthen the democratic process and promote good  governance,  the
observance and protection of  human  rights  and  ensuring  freedom  of  the
media.

Regarding legislative oversight over multilateral structures, to date  there
is inadequate information on how Parliament can  monitor  and  evaluate  the
implementation of Nepad, let alone  compliance  with  its  requirements.  We
will  have  to  investigate  this  further.  We  will  have  to  investigate
legislative  participation  in  international  negotiations.   The   current
practice is that only the executive branch conducts  such  negotiations  and
informs Parliament after the fact. But the new era of  co-operation  between
the legislature and the executive requires that the legislature should  play
a role in these negotiations.

There should be capacity-building for members of Parliament to  enable  them
to play this rightful  role  and  for  members  of  parliament  in  all  the
parliaments of Africa to be able to play this role. This includes  not  only
capacity-building in the sense of research, but also as far  as  the  status
of members of parliament is concerned vis-à-vis  members  of  the  executive
and bureaucrats. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, hon Minister and  Deputy  Minister,  ladies  and
gentlemen, today we are addressing a very critical subject, in  the  history
of our nation, our people and our county, a subject  on  which  depends  the
achievement of our vision of African success. This debate takes place  at  a
time when our Government and our  movement,  the  ANC,  have  declared  this
month the month of sustainable youth development.  It  is  worth  mentioning
that 58 years ago it was the generation of young people - the generation  of
Nelson Mandela, Oliver Thambo, Walter Sisulu and many others - who,  in  the
founding manifesto of the African  National  Congress  Youth  League,  vowed
that Africa's cause must thrive.

That was a persuasion arising from the founding clarion call of the ANC,  as
the Deputy Minister mentioned earlier, in 1912 when the ANC, in  pursuit  of
the unity of the subjugated, called for the unity of all the  ethnic  groups
in South Africa. As we are debating this subject today, it is  important  to
locate the role that young people should be playing in the  whole  issue  of
the African Renaissance and the New Partnership for Africa's Development.

I am talking about African unity and development, and  in  this  context  we
are talking about the critical role that Parliament must play. It is  clear,
even from the speakers who spoke before me, that consensus  is  emerging  in
this House, and I think that this consensus will  inform  the  intellectuals
and scholars who are constructing concepts on a daily basis.  In  the  South
African context post-1994, the only possible understanding of  a  parliament
is that it is nothing else than a tribunal of the masses of our people.

It is in that context that I want to agree with all the  speakers  who  have
spoken before me that there is  no  way  in  which  Parliament  can  play  a
critical role in the development of Africa  and  its  unity  without  taking
into account the aspirations and views of the masses of our  people  on  the
ground. Hence a critical role for Parliament and the NCOP in  particular  is
to mobilise the  masses  of  our  people  behind  our  vision  for  Africa's
development. I hope we are all united around that particular idea.

African heads of state and government met in Togo to adopt the  Constitutive
Act of the African Union. This Act laid the foundation for the  creation  of
the African Union. The decision declaring the establishment of  the  African
Union was adopted in Libya last year. It is this  African  Union  that  will
replace the existing OAU. Allow me to mention just  a  few  of  the  African
Union's objectives. Other speakers have already mentioned some.

These  include  greater  African  unity  and  solidarity   between   African
countries and peoples of Africa;  the  acceleration  of  the  political  and
socioeconomic  integration  of   the   continent;   the   encouragement   of
international co-operation; the promotion of peace, security  and  stability
on the continent; the promotion of sustainable development at the  economic,
social and cultural levels; and the integration of African economies.

I think there is no way in which these ideals  can  succeed  unless  we,  as
representatives of the masses of our people, are able, on an ongoing  basis,
to interact with our people and involve them in a process  that  shapes  and
defines the particular destiny that we want to define.

Our  President  has  been  travelling  around   the   world   lobbying   for
international support for Nepad. We are proud to say that  this  partnership
has been welcomed with open arms throughout the world. In fact  the  success
of Nepad is directly dependent on the success of the African Union.

The success of the African Union will ensure that Africa  will  never  again
be  marginalised  economically  in  a  globalising  world.  We  will  be   a
competitive bloc, a bloc that reaps  the  fruits  of  globalisation.  As  it
stands, Africa is one of the  richest  continents  in  the  world,  but  its
economic activity accounts for less than 5% of world output. This  does  not
come without challenges, hence today we are discussing  critical  tasks  for
the successful achievement of African unity and development.

To quote our hon President: ``Only strong political structures will be  able
to mobilise the people across the continent''.  I  think  the  hon  Matthee,
Kent Durr and Sandra Botha have already mentioned that  point.  I  am  happy
that today at least there is  a  convergence  of  ideas  across  the  party-
political spectrum on these critical issues and challenges that  are  facing
our nation.

There is no doubt that the African Union will require leadership, and  South
Africa has already proved beyond  any  reasonable  doubt  that  it  has  the
willingness and capacity to provide leadership on that particular front.  It
is thus  important  that  parliamentarians  from  throughout  the  continent
engage vigorously, co-operate and work together to ensure that this  century
does indeed become an African century. This point of  departure  has  to  be
shared by all of us.

Potential obstacles to an African Union have been raised  repeatedly.  These
include problems of instability and conflict, economic underdevelopment  and
the HIV/Aids issue. As a young person in this Parliament I want to say  that
when we talk about this  social  ill,  we  should  keep  in  mind  that  the
majority of the people who are at the receiving end of  this  scourge  of  a
disease are the young people. Other obstacles  are  the  marginalisation  of
the continent's rural masses and the violation of human rights.

However, our Africa, as the hon President often says, is an Africa of  hope.
Uganda has been successful with its HIV/Aids  strategy.  This  is  surely  a
clear sign of hope. The end of the war in Angola  was  a  victorious  moment
for us as a continent.

The intervention of the South African  government  in  Zimbabwe  before  and
after the presidential elections has been about securing  unity  and  common
purpose among Zimbabweans, which  is  a  critical  tool  for  stability  and
economic prosperity in that country. It is in that context that  the  policy
of our Government  and  the  position  that  has  been  articulated  by  our
President on Zimbabwe must be understood. As I  listen  to  members  of  the
opposition I am pleased that day in and day out we  are  beginning  to  come
closer to one another in terms of appreciating challenges  that  are  facing
our country and how we  can  use  our  resources,  both  administrative  and
political, to assist our neighbours beyond the borders of South Africa.

The hon Kent Durr spoke about corruption being rife in  Africa.  We  do  not
have to be historians to understand that that is indeed true. We agree  with
the hon member. But this corruption must be understood  in  context.  It  is
not  something  which  came  after  colonialism  in  many  African   states.
Corruption  was  inherently  part  and  parcel  of  the  policies   of   the
colonialists when they were dividing  our  people  and  creating  their  own
stooges and puppet administrations. It is in that context that  we  need  to
understand this corruption.

The point of departure for all of us is not to bemoan all  this  corruption.
It should be about how we unite as a nation, country and people to  confront
the threat of corruption. Are the old tactics  of  dealing  with  corruption
still relevant in the current context?  Those  are  the  critical  questions
that we need to confront.

I want to believe that the position that has been  adopted  by  the  leading
party in this country, the ANC, in dealing with corruption  is  outstanding,
not only within our own country. It  is  the  first  ruling  party  in  this
country, of course, and among the few in Africa that have been able to  deal
with corruption in a transparent way. It is the first party in this  country
to come up with legislation, with Acts of  Parliament,  that  make  openness
and transparency obligatory even for the members of the executive  councils.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF  FOREIGN  AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  it  has  been  very
encouraging to listen to the inputs made today, because  what  is  clear  is
that the rampant Afro-pessimism  of  the  past  few  years  is  now  on  the
retreat. Even hon members from the opposition are able to discuss this  very
important  issues  looking  at  our  weaknesses,  but  making   constructive
suggestions on how we move forward and how we  deal  with  the  problems.  I
think that is  a  remarkable  advance.  It  reflects  a  political  maturity
amongst our colleagues on the other side. I think what we need to do  is  to
accept the reality that we do not  mind  opposition.  In  fact,  we  welcome
constructive opposition which is geared  towards  assisting  us  in  dealing
with our weaknesses and moving forward.

Therefore, all  parliamentarians,  not  only  in  Government,  but  also  in
opposition, must now begin to see themselves as positive ambassadors  for  a
positive message of South  Africa  and,  indeed,  of  our  continent.  I  am
reminded of a story by Ken Owen published yesterday in the Business Day,  in
which he reflected on his experience with  a  top  British  businessman  who
came to South Africa. This businessman said  that  before  he  came  he  was
briefed by so many people who told him that he was walking into a  state  of
anarchy, a country that was collapsing, in which economic system is bad.

This reminded me of what some of our colleagues  said  some  time  ago.  The
businessman said that when he came here he discovered within two  days  that
those who were briefing him did  not  know  what  they  were  talking  about
because in South Africa he found a vibrant country. He said  that  he  found
an economic system that has been managed excellently, and that  the  people,
despite the problems they had, were  committed  to  findings  solutions  and
becoming a winning nation.

I think we can repeat that experience 101 times - about people abroad  being
given negative messages based on the assumption, which  is  always  referred
to, that nothing good can come out of Africa.  So  today's  discussion  does
give me a little hope that we have crossed that  rubicon,  and  that  people
are now beginning to act as opposition in the interests of the nation  as  a
whole and not just for the sake of opposition. I welcome that.

I think we need to look a little more closely at  the  suggestions  of  what
the parliamentarians, the legislature and the executive,  must  do.  It  has
already been 18 months since the President put forward the whole process  of
the African Union and Nepad, and, in fact,  suggested  certain  things  that
Parliament must do. The parliamentary working  group  is  a  very  important
instrument for  interaction.  We  must  improve  the  interaction  with  the
legislature and the executive. There is no doubt about  that.  Some  of  the
suggestions that have been made we must take on board.

Let me end by saying that  Nepad  will  win  or  fail  on  the  basis  of  a
partnership. The partnerships between governments is  inevitable.  One  must
have partnerships with governments.  Ultimately  the  most  important  thing
will be partnerships between governments and civil society, as  I  mentioned
to the very successful meeting with the private sector in Durban,  at  which
so many top members of the private sector had  signed  this  declaration  in
support of Nepad and partnerships.

We seek partnerships because,  indeed,  without  partnerships  Nepad  cannot
succeed. I  hope  that  parliamentarians  in  their  study  groups,  in  the
portfolio committees and in the  debates  that  they  organise,  will  start
focusing  more  sharply  on  the  concrete  issues  that  confront   us   in
implementing Nepad, and really make  a  positive  contribution  to  help  us
succeed because, as somebody said, the earlier  challenge  of  the  OAU  was
decolonisation and the fight against apartheid. The challenge  now  is  what
Minister  Erwin  has  to  lead,  the  challenge  to  bring  about   economic
reconstruction and economic development so that we can end  the  poverty  in
which the vast majority of our people live.

I thank all hon members.  They  must  become  good  citizens  in  the  fight
against poverty and we hope that together we will succeed. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 31 - Trade and Industry:

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, hon members, my  colleagues
the MECs who are present here, ladies and gentlemen, the  chairpersons,  and
many of the chief executives and top management, not only from the  national
Department of Trade and Industry,  but  also  from  the  provinces  who  are
present, today I would like to try something new in this House. This year  I
would like to present the budget of the Department of Trade and Industry  in
a manner specific to this Council.

For the first time, the MECs and I, and  our  respective  departments,  have
worked together to co-ordinate our inputs  for  today's  Vote.  Many  of  my
provincial colleagues are here today, as I have indicated,  and  will  focus
on the events in their provinces.

Secondly, in my  own  address  I  will  focus  on  our  relations  with  the
provinces and what the Department of Trade and Industry and  the  DTI  group
do in the provinces. Together we are building a team for the development  of
our economy. This  is  co-operative  governance  in  action.  I  would  urge
members to make use of  the  material  that  we  made  available  today,  in
particular, the publication on  provincial  strategies,  which  hon  members
should have with them in these little paper - not plastic - bags.

I think this is  the  first  time  we  have  put  together  a  report  in  a
standardised format on all the provinces with the strategies that  they  are
undertaking. I also urge hon members to have a look  at  the  exhibition  in
the NCOP chambers - the old NCOP chambers  -  because  I  think,  like  last
time, when hon members saw satellites, they will now really  see  some  very
interesting things such as wine and jewellery from the Free State,  our  own
indigenous silk  from  the  North  West,  fantastically  exciting  clothing,
paprika and a whole range of other products from the Limpopo  province.  Hon
members will also  see,  from  the  Western  Cape,  the  new  technology  we
mentioned last time - the new exhaust systems - and from  Gauteng  the  very
exciting projects that they are doing. Each of the  provinces'  exhibits,  I
think, indicate to hon members just how diverse our economy is and what  the
provinces are doing.

The South  African  Constitution  enjoins  us  to  build  an  efficient  and
effective Government that is responsive to the needs of our  people.  To  do
this we  have  to  work  together  with  all  levels  of  Government  in  an
integrated approach  in  order  to  impact  successfully  on  this  economy.
Through our experience  we  have  become  better  at  intergovernmental  co-
operation  and  have  realised  that  to   reach   our   people,   we   need
decentralisation,   combined   with    co-ordination,    co-operation    and
harmonisation.

We are learning to understand that co-operative governance  is  intended  to
be more than simply  a  constitutional  ideal,  but  a  means  of  enhancing
Government service delivery in the context  of  the  political,  social  and
economic realities of  all  nine  of  our  provinces.  I  believe  that  the
Department of Trade and Industry has improved the relations with  provinces,
and we are commencing work with local government. The DTI  is  committed  to
continuing to build this interaction as a  fundamental  strategy  to  pursue
economic strategies that are aimed  at  overcoming  poverty  and  inequality
through sustainable growth and development.

The overarching objective of our Government is to  ensure  that  sustainable
development takes place, that employment opportunities are created and  that
poverty and inequalities in the economy  are  eradicated.  Members  will  be
aware of the Microeconomic  Reform  Strategy  which  was  announced  by  the
President in 2001. We have made a narrative version of  this  available,  as
it is another achievement in our efforts to restructure the economy.

The strategy requires that all spheres of government focus  increasingly  on
microeconomic reform to accelerate  economic  growth,  generate  employment,
reduce economic inequalities and promote competitiveness. An  important  new
dimension to this strategy is the geographic spread of  productive  activity
and sustainable economic opportunities. This  is  why  the  nine  provincial
growth and development strategies are of such importance.

To build onto this economic action plan, we have  published  the  Integrated
Manufacturing Strategy, which is essentially a vision for the  manufacturing
sector of this country. Joint parliamentary  hearings  were  held  a  little
more than four weeks ago  on  this  strategy.  In  addition,  revised  Small
Business and Black Economic Empowerment Strategy documents will be  released
to form part of a wider programme by the DTI to build a sound  economy  that
meet the needs of people in an equitable manner. To this end, we  are  going
to specifically look at alternative types of enterprise,  including,  as  we
have indicated, co-operative.

The budget of  the  DTI  increasingly  reflects  these  priorities  and  the
growing alignment between the priorities and activities of the  DTI  in  the
provinces.  We  have  specifically  set  aside  funds  in  our  budget   for
intergovernmental relations to promote this alignment process.

Intergovernmental relations represent an opportunity to effectively  utilise
state resources and the expertise that  resides  in  the  provinces  and  at
local and government level. The DTI has taken a  number  of  initiatives  to
create a platform for policy dialogue with other spheres of government.

Every six  weeks,  the  DTI's  executive  board  meets  with  the  heads  of
departments from the provinces. The director-general chairs these  meetings.
I also meet  regularly  with  the  responsible  members  in  the  provincial
executive   councils   to   discuss   strategic    issues    that    require
intergovernmental consultation, co-operation and co-ordination.

In addition, the executive board undertakes provincial visits on  a  monthly
basis at which they meet with the captains of  industry,  local  councillors
and the members of provincial legislatures to exchange views and  ideas,  as
well as learn from each other about strategies for economic development  and
growth in the provinces.

This forms part of a concerted effort from our side  to  create  a  platform
for effective engagement with the provinces and,  on  a  broader  level,  to
ensure that our policies are moving in the same direction.  Our  interaction
with the provinces creates an opportunity to also assess our performance  in
service delivery, to set benchmarks and to identify best practices.
This interaction informs us of the difficulties and challenges faced by  all
spheres of government, about achievements that  they  have  made  and  about
delivery challenges. Through this learning process, we also  develop  better
ways  of  working,  better  ways  of  delivering   quality   services   more
efficiently and more effectively.

Our  Constitution  provides  for  certain  responsibilities  to  be   shared
concurrently between  national  and  provincial  government.  These  include
important public interest issues, such  as  consumer  protection  and  trade
metrology, as well as the regulation of the gambling and liquor industries.

We have spent considerable time over the previous seven years  defining  the
roles and responsibilities of each tier of government in  respect  of  these
concurrent powers. This has been an important debate, and what  has  emerged
is a clear division of labour that  ensures  that  efficient  and  effective
customer delivery occurs and that the provisions  of  our  Constitution  are
upheld.

We recently formulated a new liquor  Bill  with  provinces,  and  expect  to
complete amendments to gambling legislation soon. I will shortly be  tabling
this legislation before Parliament for hon members' consideration.

The main challenge we  have  is  to  raise  the  levels  of  investment  and
employment. This can be best achieved if there is a  dynamic  synergy  among
national, provincial and local government planning.  Integrated  development
plans are critically important tools for meeting this  challenge.  Provinces
are addressing the task of aligning these IDPs  with  their  own  provincial
strategies,  and  the  DTI  is  working  closely  with  the  Department   of
Provincial and  Local  Government  and  is  represented  on  the  integrated
development plan evaluation committee. This greater degree of  co-ordination
will  ensure  that  the  whole  country  becomes  more  enterprise-friendly,
attracting higher levels of domestic and foreign investment  and  generating
more small business opportunities and jobs.

Our many comparative advantages need to be better  marketed  and  understood
both at home and around the world. This diversity of opportunity is  one  of
South Africa's greatest assets. Most  provinces  have  established  one-stop
investment centres to facilitate investments in the regions.

An exiting new development  is  increased  co-operation  between  provinces.
Whilst provinces may compete on the efficiency of service they offer -  this
is  a  very  healthy  form  of  competition  -  there  is  now   a   greater
understanding of the  need  for  and  basis  of  the  geographic  spread  of
productive investments. As we refocus our attention on  the  development  of
integrated value matrices, linking raw materials, production and  logistics,
greater co-ordination between  provinces  is  essential.  For  example,  co-
operation between Gauteng as a manufacturing  hub  and  KwaZulu-Natal  as  a
logistics gateway  is  essential  to  ensure  that  our  goods  reach  their
destinations in the most efficient manner possible.

As a result of our improved interaction with each province and  the  strides
made  by  provinces  in  analysing   their   economies,   a   more   nuanced
understanding of the  differing  comparative  advantages  of  the  different
provinces has emerged. I will highlight just some of these  differences.  My
colleagues,  no  doubt,  will  provide  more  details  on   their   specific
economies.

The provinces of Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal  and  the  Western  Cape  contribute
more  than  two-thirds  of  South  Africa's   GDP.   These   provinces   are
characterised by a wide variety of activities that  include  the  industrial
sector, agriculture, tourism and trade and the financial services sector.

The Western Cape, on the face of it, seems to be dominated  by  agriculture,
but in fact has  a  very  diversified  economy  with  great  potential.  Its
contribution to the GDP  of  South  Africa  is  the  third  highest.  It  is
imperative that we achieve some stability of planning in  the  province,  as
it  would  be  a  mistake  to  rely  on  market  forces  alone.   High-value
manufacturing needs to be nurtured, and requires both certainty and  a  more
stable planning  process.  For  example,  an  exciting  development  in  the
province is the emergence in South  Africa  of  the  first  information  and
communication technology cluster,  ICT,  that  resembles  similar  clusters,
such as the UK's Silicon Valley in Cambridge.

KwaZulu-Natal, with its key strength in trade and logistics  infrastructure,
is the second highest contributor to South Africa's GDP. The port of  Durban
handles 30 million tons of cargo worth in excess of R100 billion  per  year.
Despite the impressive volume of trade, improving  the  managerial  capacity
and efficiency of operations in  the  port  remains  a  challenge.  This  is
reflected in the small number of containers handled per hour  in  the  port,
17 per hour, while Singapore, for example, handles 85 containers  per  hour.
Because this port plays such a crucial role in our economy it  will  be  the
first concession of a container terminal in South Africa.

Our success in growing our exports presents us with new  challenges.  Durban
needs to handle significantly larger volumes of cargo than it has ever  done
in its history. To do this  we  must  turn  to  more  experienced  container
terminal operators. It is a matter of urgency, as we cannot afford  to  slow
down our growing imports and exports.

Gauteng  is  the  largest  contributor  to  South  Africa's  GDP  at  36,5%.
[Interjections.] That is history,  not  work.  [Laughter.]  The  three  most
important sectors  contributing  to  the  GDP  are  financial  and  business
services,  logistics  and  communication,  and  mining.   The   growth   and
development plans for the province are underpinned by the Blue IQ  projects.
These consist of 11  different  mega  projects  in  economic  infrastructure
development in the areas of technology, tourism, transport and  high  value-
added direct investment in the next 10 years. The aim  is  to  attract  some
R100 billion of this direct investment. In excess of R2 billion has  already
been allocated by the Gauteng  provincial  government  to  facilitate  these
investments. There is a display of them at the NCOP chambers.

Although the platinum province is the  third  lowest  contributor  to  South
Africa's GDP, the North West is the  dominant  province  in  mineral  sales.
Mining contributes 35,5% to its  economy  and  17,8%  of  total  employment.
Manufacturing is almost exclusively dependent on the performance  of  a  few
sectors in which the province enjoys  a  competitive  advantage.  These  are
fabricated metals, food and nonmetallic metals. The platinum SDI can  unlock
further development. It is on the coast-to-coast highway that  links  Maputo
port in Mozambique to Walvis Bay in Namibia. Around  200  potential  project
opportunities in tourism, manufacturing, agriculture and  mining  have  been
identified.

The Limpopo province has a strong rural bias. Its  growth  strategy  centres
on addressing infrastructure backlogs, alleviation  of  poverty  and  social
development. With the exception of services, the top performing sectors  are
in the primary sectors, including mining, quarrying,  agriculture,  forestry
and fishing. Underpinning the  growth  and  development  strategies  in  the
province are the Phalaborwa SDI and the N1 Corridor, which  encompass  agro-
processing  and   mining   beneficiation   activities.   Regional   economic
integration takes the form of the so-called golden horseshoe, which aims  to
create a single reserve that will arc from  the  Kruger  Park  in  the  east
around to Botswana in the west. The culturally and historically  significant
Mapungubwe site will be included in this development initiative.

In Mpumalanga the Maputo Corridor, which links  the  province  with  Gauteng
and  Maputo  in  Mozambique,  heralds  a  new  era  in  terms  of   economic
development and growth in that region. As the first international toll  road
in Africa, the corridor aims to attract investment,  unlock  local  economic
potential of  the  landlocked  parts  of  the  country,  and  thus  generate
sustainable economic growth that  will  lead  to  sustainable  good  quality
jobs.  The  best  performing  sectors  in  the  province   include   mining,
manufacturing  and  services.  Tourism  and  agro-processing  are  potential
growth sectors in this province.

The Northern Cape is an important  contributor  to  South  Africa's  primary
production and has considerable potential for  the  beneficiation  of  these
primary commodities. What is also interesting  to  note  is  the  growth  of
value-added  activities,  including  game  farming.  Food   production   and
processing for the local  and  export  markets  are  growing  significantly.
Underpinning the growth  and  development  plan  of  the  province  are  the
investment projects that link up with the existing plans of the  Namaqualand
Development Corridor. The focus is on the beneficiation and  export  of  sea
products.

In the context of our Nepad objectives,  these  four  provinces,  the  North
West, Limpopo, Mpumulanga and the Northern Cape, have a very important  role
to facilitate increased trading links and  regional  co-operation  with  our
neighbours to the north.

The Free State, best known for its maize production, has in the last  decade
reduced  its  dependency  on  this  primary  sector,  and   has   become   a
manufacturing economy. Many people will be surprised to learn  that  14%  of
the province's manufacturing is classified  as  high-technology  industries,
which is the highest percentage of all the provincial economies.

This growth in high-tech industries is significant in  the  context  of  the
changing contribution of the gold-mining industry to the gross  geographical
product.  The  province's  three-tier  development   strategy   centres   on
competitiveness,   empowerment   and   capacity-building,   as    well    as
beneficiation.

The first Industrial Development Zone to be proclaimed in South  Africa  was
Coega in the Eastern Cape and we  are  confident  that  this  is  attracting
significant interest from large investors.  This  province  is  the  hub  of
South Africa's auto  industry.  As  the  country  is  improving  its  export
performance in the context of  an  integrated  manufacturing  strategy,  the
province has the potential substantially to  increase  its  contribution  to
the manufacturing sector. The East  London  and  Coega  purpose-built  ports
will undoubtedly position the Eastern Cape as one  of  the  key  competitive
areas in South Africa. The challenge of a  more  equitable  distribution  of
the benefits of these developments into rural areas remains.

At national level, the DTI is improving its efficiencies to ensure that  our
services and products are widely accessible  and  that  they  are  delivered
faster each day. We have launched the DTI's customer  contact  centre  about
three weeks ago. I would like hon  members  to  note  this  number,  because
queries should not be directed to me but to this  number  please,  0861  843
384. Now, that ``843 384'' on a cellphone spells ``the'' DTI.  From  now  on
we are able to quantify the number of calls we receive, what the  frequently
asked questions are and how  long  it  takes  to  respond  to  a  query.  In
addition, we are able to check whether staff members do pick up their  phone
calls. Some provinces will be launching their own call centres in  the  next
few weeks and I am pleased that we will be able to co-operate with them.

Given the importance of manufacturing, let me  pay  some  attention  to  the
manufacturing advisory centre programme in the provinces.  It  has  produced
significant  results.  Over  the  past  financial  year  the   Manufacturing
Advisory Centre programme has increased  its  presence  from  two  to  seven
provinces and currently has  16  operational  offices  across  the  country.
Other  targeted  support  programmes  such  as  the  franchise  advice   and
information network will be rolled out in the provinces.

With regard to some success stories, in Mmabatho in the North West  a  group
of sewing women early in  2001  pooled  their  resources  to  form  Mmabatho
Textiles and  Printers.  The  local  Brain  affiliate  -  hon  members  have
information on that in their  packs  -  assisted  the  group  to  develop  a
strategy. Today this company has won  several  tenders  worth  thousands  of
rands to supply hospitals  and  schools  in  the  region  with  high-quality
overalls, dust coats and bed sheets.

In  Gauteng,  MNH  Building  Construction,  a   black-owned   building   and
renovation company, similarly approached Brain and with its help  has  since
won a tender to the  value  of  R2,2  million  for  renovations  to  Tembisa
Hospital. They approached Khula Credit Guarantee Scheme  for  assistance  at
the start of the project and were granted a loan of R1  million.  These  are
some of the success stories that we are increasingly encountering.

A study on the impact of Khula products was conducted recently with  a  view
to improvement. We are also in the  process  of  reviewing  the  mandate  of
Khula and the National Empowerment Fund. Our figures show  that  most  Khula
Start and Credit Guarantee Schemes are allocated to KwaZulu-Natal,  followed
by the Northern Province and Mpumalanga.  Jobs  created  by  Khula-supported
businesses since inception amount to over 700 000 jobs supported.

The IDC has had tremendous success in financing small businesses in  various
sectors of the economy. Over 70% of all IDC  loans  in  the  last  financial
year were allocated to small  manufacturing  enterprises.  The  IDC  has  an
important  role  in  facilitating  investment  in  the  provinces,  and   is
financing 100 tourism projects across South Africa. Each province stands  to
benefit from this R1,2 billion  investment  in  a  whole  range  of  tourist
infrastructure.

In  addition,  another   major   contribution   has   been   investment   in
beneficiation.  Recently,  the  IDC's   facilitation   of   the   successful
restructuring of the steel sector, through the unbundling of Iscor  and  the
formation of Khumba, has provided a boost to the economies of  the  Northern
Cape, the Western Cape and Gauteng.

The CSIR is undertaking work in all provinces.  I  think  one  of  the  most
interesting is the beneficiation of natural  products  into  various  drugs,
and  using  the  products  we  have  for  commercial   purposes,   such   as
pharmaceuticals and food. The CSIR  manages  the  Technology  for  Women  in
Business programme and next weekend we launch the  SA  Women's  Entrepreneur
Network. Both of these impact on all provinces.

Our job would not be fulfilled if we did not empower  people  in  the  rural
areas. One of the projects set out in my speech, as hon  members  will  see,
is a project by the  SA  Bureau  of  Standards  to  upgrade  rural  schools'
science capacity. These are just some examples of  the  offerings  available
to provinces from the various institutions of the DTI.

I believe there are many  signs  that  the  fruits  of  our  hard  work  are
beginning to ripen. More than ever, we must combine  to  take  advantage  of
the positive developments in  our  economy.  The  greatly  improved  working
relationships  between  levels  of  government  must  be  consolidated  even
further. What is a matter of great satisfaction to me is that all  provinces
are brimming with potential. We have no cinderella  provinces,  despite  the
historical legacy of uneven development. Each  province  is  very  different
but, as I have stressed, our diversity is in fact our strength.

I would like to thank my provincial colleagues for their great spirit of co-
operation and I congratulate them on a  year  of  very  hard  work.  We  are
certainly advancing. My thanks to Mosheen Moosa and his committee for  their
hard work and to  this  House  for  its  unending  interest  and  attention,
combined with a healthy sense of humour and goodwill. The shared vision  and
concrete endeavours that I have outlined today would not have been  achieved
without the commitment of key individuals, including  the  Deputy  Minister,
whom I would like to wish a speedy recovery, as well  as  other  members  of
the DTI team and its institutions. [Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, hon Minister, my hon colleague  Rob  Davies  from
the National Assembly - I am very glad he came to listen  to  the  debate  -
hon director-general, members of the DTI group of institutions ...  We  have
Mr Joe Foster somewhere. Is he still there? I am sure he is nostalgic  about
not being down here. Hon members will remember that Mr Foster was  a  member
of this House.

This particular debate taking place today is different, and unfortunately  I
do not know if all of that has been made clear, so I  am  going  to  mention
just a little of what is happening today. For the first time in the  history
of the NCOP, we have managed to get all nine provinces to  display  some  of
their products and some  of  their  economic  activity  in  Parliament.  Hon
members are aware of a display that is taking place outside the  library  in
the NCOP foyer. Some  announcements  were  made  this  morning.  I  am  sure
members who heard those announcements would have gone there to have  a  look
at the displays of each province's economic activities.

I want to thank Seroge Naidoo  and  members  from  the  DTI  who  made  that
display possible. A very special request was made to MECs to participate  in
this debate through the MinMec process. I thank the  hon  the  Minister  for
making that request. Unfortunately only four MECs managed to  take  part  in
this debate. Hopefully next year we will get all  nine  MECs.  The  idea  of
having a debate such as this is that at least once a  year  we  should  have
key economic leaders from the different  provinces  of  the  country  coming
together in one place, sharing their ideas, and talking about what they  are
doing. We know that they do it all the time in MinMec and in  meetings,  but
somewhere along the line, once a year, the public should be able  to  get  a
grasp of what is happening regarding economic activities in different  parts
of the country. It is important that we make this a memorable event  once  a
year.

I want to thank members of provincial departments who have  made  themselves
available to come here to kickstart this process.  Hopefully,  we  will  get
political heads here next time.

I want to say that it is quite exciting to stand up and participate  in  the
debate at this particular juncture in our history.  The  Minister  wrote  an
article for the Sunday Times' Business Times in April 2002, headed ``We  are
talking about a revolution''. I  do  not  know  how  many  people  saw  that
article, but I think it is something members would want to read.  It  starts
out by saying that few people  now  realise  quite  how  severe  the  crisis
facing the South African economy was in the dying years of  apartheid.  What
the new democratic South African Government did in the years  following  the
1994 elections, was to reverse a strongly ebbing tide of  fortune  and  save
South Africa from deindustrialisation. This is not a  false  statement  that
is being made. Hon members will remember that  by  the  time  we  had  taken
power in 1994, interest rates were rampant, inflation rates were way out  of
line, productivity was on the decline and  a  whole  range  of  things  were
happening that indicated that there was only one way this country was  going
to go if we did not have a fresh, new and innovative strategy in place.

After 1994, when the new Government came into power, we found that,  slowly,
through a process of trial and error, we have reached a stage where  one  is
excited to stand up and say that at last at the level  of  the  coalface  of
the economy, Government, Government leaderships and certainly the  DTI,  are
beginning to grasp the issues and take the bull by the horns  and  drive  it
in the right direction. In that sense, I just  want  to  go  through  a  few
things that the DTI has done in order to bring about  what  we  are  talking
about as a revolution, an economic revolution in this country.

To have a successful revolution,  we  need  to  have  an  army  of  focused,
committed and loyal soldiers. We cannot have a revolution without that.  The
DTI has taken on this challenge remarkably. Over the past  three  years  the
DTI has assessed and reassessed every single individual in  the  department.
Every employee has been bedded  down  with  a  rigorous  set  of  measurable
performance targets, and, where necessary, extensive skills development  and
training has taken place. [Interjections.]

Hon members can say ``wow'', but that is probably because  they  never  come
to the committee meetings. [Laughter.]

For  any  revolution  to  be  successful,  we  need  to  have  a  well-oiled
organisation that is responsible, responsive and efficient, and is as  quick
as a flash with responses. Today the Minister announced to this  House  that
a new call centre has been set up in the DTI that will respond  to  members'
requests in an instant. Members will be sent to the right part of the  right
department, where the request belongs.  Members  will  not  be  shunted  and
pushed around. If the DTI cannot help, one will be told  that  one  will  be
called back.

This system is in place for big  companies  who  phone  in,  and  for  small
businessmen from rural areas  who  call  in.  The  DTI,  together  with  the
parliamentary committees, has engineered, re-engineered  and  tweaked  every
single aspect of its organisation. Today we have designed  a  modern  first-
class DTI, in the  form  of  an  accountable  corporate  structure  that  is
becoming the envy of private companies and public corporations alike.  Under
the banner of its clarion call ``Sisebenza Sonke'' [we work  together],  the
DTI has set up a number of enterprises inside its structure which are  of  a
corporate nature.

These  enterprises  manage  a  group  of  approximately  17  companies   and
institutions that are delivering various services, and are broadly known  as
the DTI group. People sitting up there are here  today  to  account  to  the
electorate regarding what that DTI  group  does.  The  executive  management
unit of the DTI demands cutting-edge efficiency and delivery from  each  and
every one of these institutions. The tolerance for inefficiency is zero.

Any revolution needs a public face, and the DTI has renovated  its  existing
premises to uphold a progressive image. Today, the DTI has started a  trend.
If one goes across the road to 120 Plein Street one  will  see  every  other
government department beginning to do what the DTI has  started  doing.  Its
public  face  says:  ``We  are  professionals  and  we  are  here  to  serve
efficiently, quickly, and responsibly.'' The DTI is at  the  moment  in  the
process of building supermodern world  class  premises  in  Johannesburg  to
house its operations.

Every  aspect  of  the  public  face  of  the  DTI  has  been  dealt   with.
Receptionists and switchboard operators have been told to  smile  even  when
they speak on the phone. When the phone rings, they have been instructed  to
answer the phone on three rings. If that does not happen,  there  are  whole
lot of mechanisms set in place to deal with this. No  caller  must  be  left
shunted from pillar to post in the DTI.

However, no matter  how  well  the  DTI  does,  it  cannot  do  this  alone.
Provincial Economic Affairs Departments must take a leaf out of  this  book,
and begin to demand the same level of efficiency at provincial level.

Every  single  one  of  our  234  local  governments  must   have   economic
development units that work at the same level of  efficiency  and  delivery.
Our processes have to be  integrated,  as  the  Minister  mentioned  in  his
speech, involving the  departments  of  provincial  and  local  governments.
Departments delivering infrastructure  such  as  roads,  schools  and  those
things that we need every day for our people, must do this  in  a  way  that
ensures that economic imperatives in those subregions are met. This  is  the
way to build an economic revolution.

I just want to bring to the attention of the House some things that the  DTI
has put into effect. Unfortunately, the package  did  not  get  to  all  the
members, so we will  ensure  that  we  deliver  it  in  their  pigeon  holes
tomorrow. I will just tell members basically what was in  that  package.  In
that package was a document called ``Support for  Small  Business  in  South
Africa''. We have an organisation in the DTI called  Brain,  which  provides
assistance and support for small businesses in every possible  manner,  with
regard to their needs, from financial assistance to support for  technology,
support for markets and marketing of products, access and knowhow,  business
plans, and every other thing small  businesses  need.  We  have  set  up  an
organisation to do this, but the organisation does not  exist  in  a  little
office somewhere in Pretoria. The Minister has  just  announced  that  there
are 16 one-stop centres that have been set up throughout the country.  If  a
small business goes to that centre, they  will  get  well-rounded,  balanced
service from the DTI.

This is the kind of work the DTI is doing and  the  country  needs  to  know
this. Also inside the package were a number of Nemad  Trust  documents  that
we delivered to the nine MECs. Four of the MECs have received  them,  and  I
am sure they will speak about them. Inside that document there is  listed  a
whole range of accredited organisations that the  DTI  has  established  and
identified. When I say ``accredited'' I mean they have been checked  out  to
see whether the quality of their service is acceptable to the DTI.

These organisations  have  been  detailed  and  they  receive  support  from
Government to provide assistance to  small  business  organisations  working
out there. That is the level and the depth of the revolution that is  taking
place.

I want to say to the Minister that I have  been  involved  in  this  complex
process of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources  Development  Bill  recently.
The opportunity this has given us is to go out into the  little  towns,  and
see what is going on with small miners throughout the country.  I  went  out
to a little town called Springbok, where we met a lot of small  miners,  who
basically expressed to us their  difficulties  with  regard  to  mining  and
related activities.

While  I  was  there,  I  could  not  have  been  better  convinced  of  the
appropriateness and correctness of  the  integrated  manufacturing  strategy
that we put in place. The fact  of  the  matter  is  that  there  are  small
businesses in this country - I only learned this a  month  ago  -  that  are
producing small miners, alluvial and related miners. These small miners  are
producing 20 000 carats of  diamonds  per  month,  they  say.  I  was  quite
shocked. I almost fell off my chair.

These diamonds, in raw form, are  going  to  the  big  companies  which  are
marketing them to the foreign market.  With  this  happening  one  asks  the
question: Why are Springbok, Kimberley and Kuruman not the diamond  capitals
of the world? The reason for that is that we  have  not  had  some  kind  of
integrated manufacturing and beneficiation strategy in place.  We  have  not
had a strategy in place  that  says  that  we  must  inject  sufficient  and
necessary skills into those  entrepreneurs  who  are  working  hard  to  run
honest businesses in different parts of  the  country,  to  enable  them  to
beneficiate their products and to give them the mechanisms so that they  can
find the markets, at the right prices.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  member,  you  have  one
minute left.
Mr M V MOOSA: The point I am making is  that  the  integrated  manufacturing
strategy clearly is the way to go if we want  to  beneficiate  products.  We
are finding, for example, that most of the resources that  are  being  mined
in this country are being exported, and that we do not have  the  skills  in
this country to do the simplest of things, for example, smelting  manganese,
so  that  we  can  beneficiate  products  in  respect  of  manganese,  gold,
diamonds, platinum and so forth. An integrated  manufacturing  strategy  can
certainly help us do that. I see Alistair Ruiters is smiling. I do not  know
why he is smiling. Maybe I am saying something right.

These are the experiences that we encounter on the ground  when  we  go  out
there and see what is going on. It is only a revolution that  can  meet  the
challenge  facing  our  people   with   regard   to   employment,   economic
empowerment, and spreading the base  of  the  wealth  of  our  country.  The
Freedom Charter enjoins us as leaders  at  national,  provincial  and  local
levels to find these entrepreneurs and organisations that  need  assistance,
and to help them with the process of getting  there.  In  conclusion,  I  am
sure the MECs will deal further with some of the issues in the provinces.

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, Minister Erwin, MECs and colleagues,  it  is  my
honour to address this House in the budget debate on the Trade and  Industry
Vote on behalf of  the  province  of  Gauteng.  The  Gauteng  Department  of
Finance and Economic Affairs  recently  undertook  a  process  of  strategic
introspection, with the purpose of delivering on its provincial  priorities,
which in turn gave rise  to  a  revised  vision,  namely  the  provision  of
excellence  in  financial  management,   and   the   optimisation   of   its
contribution in  the  creation  of  an  enabling  environment  for  economic
growth.

As far as the economic component is concerned,  the  driving  force  towards
this vision is, in the first instance, the achievement  of  economic  growth
and development through  investment  in  strategic  economic  infrastructure
that boosts the competitive  advantages  of  key  sectors  of  the  economy;
increased trade and investment; and contributing to an ethical business  and
regulatory  environment.  Secondly,  we  strive  towards  an  output-driven,
ethical and people-centred administration which  reflects  the  demographics
of our province.

The Gauteng budget breakdown reflects the  importance  placed  on  achieving
economic growth  and  development.  No  less  that  84%  of  the  budget  is
allocated to growing the provincial economy. In terms  of  the  Government's
financial system  classification,  the  capital  allocation  of  the  budget
constitutes  75%.  Gauteng  remains  committed  to  growing  the  provincial
economy and these allocations are proof of our sincerity.

The strength of the Gauteng  economy  can  also  be  seen  by  its  sectoral
contributions to the  gross  domestic  product.  The  finance  and  business
services contributes 50%, transport 44,2%, construction 39,3%, trade  39,2%,
manufacturing 34,7% and community services 31%. The Gauteng economy  employs
32% of the people in formal  employment,  and  with  the  exception  of  the
agricultural and mining sectors, the province  is  the  leader  in  sectoral
employment. Of people  employed  in  the  financial  and  business  services
sector, 51,6% are employed in Gauteng, with 42% in transport  and  35,2%  in
the manufacturing sector. It is therefore clear  that  the  Gauteng  economy
contributes more than one third of the national GDP.

The year 2001, which was the  first  year  of  implementation  of  Blue  IQ,
delivered  a  rich  harvest  of  accomplishments.  The  Gauteng   Provincial
Government demonstrated its commitment to public-private partnerships in  an
inaugural ``Blue IQ Means Business'' week which aimed  at  exploring  common
areas of interest with the private sector. The  public's  positive  response
to the launch of Blue IQ projects, such as the Mary  Fitzgerald  Square  and
the Nelson  Mandela  Bridge  in  Newtown,  also  encouraged  our  provincial
government to the extent that 2002 will equally  pose  challenges  for  Blue
IQ.

The Gauteng government has accelerated its campaign to  raise  awareness  of
business opportunities within its projects in the  current  financial  year.
Expected highlights of the year are the completion of  the  Metro  mall  and
trading facility in July, together with  the  Turbine  Hall  development  in
Newtown and the turning of the first sod at the site of the  Innovation  Hub
in Tshwane. The Gauteng provincial government  is  committed  to  excellence
through skills development  and  the  training  of  our  citizens  and  has,
through its Automotive Industry Development Centre,  signed  a  R12  million
agreement with four Gauteng-based tertiary institutions.

The Alternative Information and Development Centre, AIDC,  aims  to  improve
capacity  in  technical  skills   training,   automotive   engineering   and
managerial  skills  in  the  automotive  industry.  It  has  begun  to  reap
substantial rewards and has  begun  to  establish  its  credibility  in  the
automotive industry. Over 3 000 students have already completed  courses  at
these institutions.

I hope members will allow me to boast a little at this  point.  Hon  members
might have read in the press that the BMW factory at Rosslyn  near  Pretoria
is now building BMWs  of  a  higher  quality  than  the  mother  factory  in
Germany, and even of a higher quality compared with other luxury  cars  from
the original plants in Germany  and  Scandinavia.  This  is  not  propaganda
thought up in Johannesburg, but is the outcome of a research project by  the
influential J D Powers and Associates of America. This is indeed not only  a
feather in the cap of Gauteng-based industry,  but  also  an  indication  of
what South African industry is capable of.

The influence of the Blue IQ portfolio of projects has begun  to  impact  on
the Gauteng economy. The May 2002  issue  of  the  Nedcor  property  finance
report has acknowledged the role of the Blue IQ  projects  on  the  property
markets. It mentions that growing public-sector investment is adding  a  new
dimension to the property market and that 2002 is expected to be a  year  of
significant  public-sector  investment  with  positive  spin-offs  for   the
property market in general.

It is clear that the investments of the Gauteng  provincial  government  are
having the desired impact as private-sector investments are being  mobilised
to take advantage of the opportunities created.

Increased investment has been identified  as  the  cornerstone  of  economic
development in Gauteng. In 2000-01 the Gauteng Economic Development  Agency,
or Geda, facilitated investments to  the  value  of  R610  million  and  the
creation of 1 710 primary jobs. This figure does not  include  secondary  or
downstream  jobs.  The  ultimate  objective  of  Geda  is  to  increase  its
contribution towards the growth of the Gauteng  economy  and  to  indirectly
improve the growth prospects of the South African economy.

The Gauteng  Manufacturing  Advisory  Centre,  or  Gaumac,  has  been  fully
established  as  a  section  21  company  to  service   small   and   medium
manufacturing enterprises  in  Gauteng  and  was  successfully  launched  in
Sedibeng,  Ekurhuleni  and  the  West  Rand  with  operational  centres   in
Vanderbijlpark, Germiston and Klerksdorp.

The impact of Gaumac will be evaluated on the basis of SMMEs contacted  with
whom working relationships ensued, the value of projects  awarded  and  jobs
sustained and facilitated. It has set  an  annual  target  of  300  projects
valued at R4,5 million and aims at sustaining 3 750  jobs  and  facilitating
600 new employment opportunities. Based on its performance thus far, we  are
confident that Gaumac will meet and even exceed its targets. It has  emerged
that  so  far  Gaumac  has  managed  to  sustain  1  401  jobs  through  its
involvement with SMMEs.

The highlight of the previous year as far as consumer affairs  is  concerned
was the launch of the consumer office on wheels, an  initiative  which  came
into being in the spirit of Batho  Pele  -  the  spirit  of  taking  service
delivery to the people.

In conclusion, the call of ``a better life for all'' is not  just  a  slogan
in Gauteng. It has become  a  way  of  living  for  the  Gauteng  provincial
government, also as far as sustainable economic  development  is  concerned.
We support the Budget Vote on Trade and Industry. [Applause.]

Ms M I MODISELLE (North  West):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,
ladies and gentlemen, I thank  you,  Chairperson,  for  the  opportunity  to
address your august House on the  occasion  of  the  DTI's  Budget  Vote.  I
congratulate the Minister on his dynamic  speech  and  concept  for  today's
debate. Because of time constraints I am going to exclude  about  six  pages
of my prepared speech which merely elaborate on background  information  and
go straight to the state of the real provincial economy of the North West.

Let me start  with  sectoral  performance.  The  main  sectors  driving  the
economy of the province are mining, agriculture, tourism and  manufacturing.
The mining industry, which  comprises  87  mines,  contributes  44%  to  the
provincial  economy  and  employs  some   100   027   workers.   Agriculture
contributes 13% of the provincial economy, producing  30%  of  the  nation's
maize. Other produce includes citrus,  sunflowers,  tobacco,  cotton,  wheat
and livestock. About 10% of the national tourism income is generated by  the
North West province.

The economic activity of the province is not, however,  evenly  spread.  The
major concentration of  economic  activity  is  in  the  Rustenburg,  Brits,
Hartebeespoort Dam, Klerksdorp, Potchefstroom and Orkney areas. These  areas
are dominated by the mining industry, manufacturing and  tourism.  The  rest
of the province is  dominated  by  arable  and  livestock  agriculture.  The
Bophirima region is the most economically depressed and underdeveloped  part
of the province.

The integrated economic and industrialisation development  plan,  the  draft
North  West  economic  and  industrialisation  plan,  has  been   completed.
Consultation was undertaken with various  stakeholders  such  as  provincial
and national departments, local authorities, labour and the private  sector.
Inputs are still awaited from the  integrated  development  plans  of  local
authorities that are still under preparation.

Once this process is completed, the plan will be submitted to the  executive
council. Thereafter it will be distributed to  stakeholders.  This  plan  is
designed to be  a  blueprint  which  is  expected  to  direct  all  economic
activities of all agents in the provincial economy.

Employment trends in the province mirror those at national  level.  Although
output in most sectors has improved, in particular traditional sectors  such
as mining, agriculture  and  manufacturing,  employment  opportunities  have
decreased. However, we have an increase in the employment  in  the  tertiary
sector - that is, trade, business  and  financial  services.  The  share  of
unskilled labour as a percentage of total employment is  rapidly  declining.
In addition, the  use  of  technology  is  deepening,  even  in  traditional
manufacturing sectors. This calls for new  measures  to  combat  the  social
problems of unemployment.

In terms of job creation we are exploring both the  short-term  and  medium-
term opportunities in the delivery of  infrastructure  investment  projects,
and  we  are  also  targeting  a  range   of   appropriate   industries   in
agroprocessing,  tourism  and  mineral  beneficiation.  Our   job   creation
projects, such as the craft planet and fashion project  in  Mabopane,  Brits
and surrounding areas, are targeted at women, youth and the  disabled.  This
will enable us to bring people who have been  marginalised  into  mainstream
economic activity, at the same time  building  capacity  and  improving  the
skills of our people.

Our attention is also focused on SMME development. We  have  developed  SMME
linkage programmes in most parts of the region  to  instil  an  enterprising
culture  amongst  the  people.   The   incubation   of   small   businesses,
microtechnology   development   and   business   management   training   and
facilitation  are  some  of  the  areas  of  small  business   support   and
development. Some  of  the  very  recent  highlights  of  these  initiatives
include the fact that 47 small businesses have so far  been  incubated,  406
people trained and 659 sustainable jobs created.

Other flagship projects that are community-based,  with  a  total  value  of
R13,5 million, have been highly successful, and it is our  aim  to  continue
to build on these achievements. We have built partnerships and  continue  to
work very closely with the  other  stakeholders  who  provide  SMME  support
services. We are very pleased with the tremendous success that our  Westmac,
a manufacturing advisory council affiliate in the  province,  has  achieved.
Our concerted efforts to  provide  high-quality  services  to  enable  small
enterprises to become  competitive  and  join  the  mainstream  economy  are
beginning to bear fruit.

I am pleased to announce that the tourism entrepreneur  of  the  year  award
presented in London in November 2001 was given to the first and only  black-
owned safari operator in  the  North  West.  Mr  Donald  Marobi,  a  budding
entrepreneur, sold everything he owned to start this business.  Through  our
procurement initiatives, we have been  able,  in  collaboration  with  other
service provider institutions and  big  businesses,  to  ensure  that  small
enterprises that are operating formally benefited from tenders to the  value
of R98 million.

In terms of the  future  development  of  the  SMMEs  we  are  looking  into
aligning  SMME  development  programmes  with  local  economic   development
initiatives at district and local municipality level. Small  businesses  are
based  in  communities,  and  the  first  point  of  contact  is  with   the
municipalities. We are therefore very keen to capacitate  local  authorities
in dealing with SMME matters.

It is very clear to us that we need to improve the  level  of  domestic  and
foreign direct investment. Although investment levels have been steady,  the
launch of Invest North West little over a year  ago  will  add  momentum  to
investment promotion activities in the province. I am  pleased  to  announce
that during the two-day international investment conference held  late  last
year, Invest North West found investment opportunities to  the  tune  of  R1
billion. The investments will flow into mining,  agriculture,  manufacturing
and tourism industries over the next three years and are expected to  create
some 4 000 sustainable jobs in the region.

We are focusing on small, medium and micro mining operations to benefit  the
previously  disadvantaged  communities  as  well  as  to  create  more   job
opportunities  for  every  rand  invested.  We  have  identified  four  main
infrastructure projects that are  aimed  at  encouraging  the  international
competitiveness  of  our  manufacturing  sector  and  generate   sustainable
economic growth, development and  employment  creation  in  the  long  term.
These include the Platinum SDI, the N12 and Western Frontier  corridors  and
the Maputo-N4 corridor development linkage.

In terms of the Platinum SDI, we are conducting research and  prefeasibility
studies for scoped projects. The Mafikeng-Vryburg  corridor  will  focus  on
agriculture and tourism as lead sectors, whilst the N12 corridor will  focus
on mining as a lead sector with  downstream  activities  such  as  jewellery
design. An application has been submitted to the  Department  of  Trade  and
Industry to have an area around the Mafikeng airport declared an  industrial
development zone. A section 21  company  has  already  been  established  to
drive this project.
Let me turn to the challenges we face. The  level  of  unemployment  in  our
province is unacceptably high. There is a marked decrease in  the  level  of
manufacturing and industrial activities. The rate of  development  in  rural
areas is still very low. Physical and economic infrastructure  is,  in  some
cases, also deteriorating. The HIV/Aids disease  is  beginning  to  make  an
impact on the economy. On the operational side there is also much  room  for
improvement. Our budget has to  be  policy-driven.  We  need  to  reposition
ourselves as a leader in economic development and industrialisation and,  at
the same time, build capacity to deliver services.

On co-operative governance, we are determined to utilise any opportunity  to
advance our relations with all economic  role-players  and  to  be  able  to
identify synergies and leverage resources to  deliver  more  services  in  a
momentous way.

In  developing  strategies  we  take  cognisance  of  the  overall  economic
framework and try to align these strategies with the economic priorities  of
the  state.  We  therefore  need  to  deepen  our  relationships  with   all
government structures to ensure policy coherence.

I would like to conclude by  saying  that  my  department  is  committed  to
ensuring that we put the North West province on a high-growth path and  that
we achieve results that impact positively on ordinary people: that jobs  are
created, that social delivery is fast-tracked and that we tackle  issues  of
HIV and Aids.

In some respects, this province has performed  well.  We  have  developed  a
detailed growth and development strategy. We  continue  to  seek  innovative
and new ways of doing business, of ensuring that we are able  to  create  an
economy that meets the needs of our people.

We continue to forge lasting partnerships with stakeholders and partners  to
create  an  environment  that  is  conducive  to  economic  development   to
improving and the living standards of the  majority  of  the  people.  [Time

Mr S T BELOT (Free State): Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  colleagues,  ladies
and gentlemen, today we are  part  of  co-operative  governance  in  action.
Today we are involved in the real economy,  as  explained  in  the  hon  the
Minister's Budget speech before the National Assembly a few weeks  ago.  The
Free State province is making strides in its effort to develop  its  economy
and  economic  activities.  Indeed,  there  is  a  definite  change  in  the
structure of the Free State economy, essentially from a primarily  dependent
economy to a manufacturing, export-orientated economy.

The Free State these days is less dependent on agriculture and  mining  than
a few  years  ago.  Instead,  the  manufacturing  and  service  sectors  are
beginning to play a greater role in the  provincial  economy.  For  example,
the Free State gross geographic  product  amounted  to  approximately  R33,4
billion in 2001, which represents a 5,8% contribution to the  South  African
economy. I could say that projections for the Free  State  GGP  indicate  an
increase for the rest of the MTEF period and  we  expect  to  do  well.  The
progress in the above regard has to be built upon and further expanded,  and
all the strategies that we have put in place are aimed at achieving  exactly
that.

It is also worth mentioning that Free State exporters are doing  exceedingly
well in the international trading arena. The Free State's major exports  are
chemicals, fruit  and  vegetables,  machinery  and  equipment,  manufactured
goods and mineral products. It is my department's intention,  therefore,  to
give special attention to trade development as we would  like  to  see  more
companies exporting.

Our strategy for economic growth  and  job  creation  entails  a  three-tier
process  which  basically  involves  the  beneficiation   of   our   natural
resources, which receives our undivided attention. In this whole process  of
adding value, we believe and we say that we need to empower  and  capacitate
our people to become involved in manufacturing ventures. Furthermore, as  we
progress on the learning curve, we know that  we  have  to  compete  in  the
global market. We know, whilst we participate  in  this  economic  activity,
that we do this in a particular context of globalisation. This  strategy  is
also underpinned by two important principles, namely industry clustering  to
avoid fragmented development and utilising  the  opportunities  provided  by
forward and backward linkages of our existing and new economic ventures.

From this perspective, the challenge we face  now  is  to  ensure  that  the
achievements that have been made so far, as  well  as  future  achievements,
can be extended to eliminate poverty and improve  equity  in  our  province,
given the status and the levels of poverty there. We therefore believe  that
the benefits of higher economic growth should be shared by more people,  and
we make sure that this happens. The vicious circle  whereby  the  inequality
between the poor and rich gets bigger has been broken. People are given  the
opportunity to participate in the mainstream economy and do  take  advantage
of the benefits. How do we do this? Perhaps I need to share that  with  this
House. Without being  overly  interventionist,  the  Free  State  government
facilitates a process  whereby  SMMEs  become  able  to,  and  do,  take  up
economic opportunities.  A  key  to  this  is  that  economic  opportunities
presented by forward and  backward  linkages  are  turned  into  viable  and
sustainable business ventures. This leads to lower business  risks  and  can
enhance the success rate of newly established SMME businesses.

However, all those who  participate  in  business  are  made  aware  of  the
reality that they should be prepared to share in the risks involved.  It  is
common knowledge that emerging businesses are  shy  to  accept  the  reality
that when one gets involved in business there is a level of  risk  that  one
must be prepared to take. However, aftercare is also very important  and  we
do provide this, to ensure the sustainability and success of the SMMEs.  For
this to happen, one needs effective business  support,  both  financial  and
nonfinancial.

As part of  our  new  approach  to  economic  development,  the  Free  State
government is implementing a regional focus strategy in terms  of  which  we
have established regional offices. These regional  offices,  with  SMME  and
tourism development advisers, operate in  a  co-ordinated  manner  with  all
development agencies so as to accelerate SMME and tourism development.  This
implies that district municipalities and development agencies such as  Khula
and Ntsika all link up with the regional  offices  in  order  to  provide  a
proper service to the people at grass-roots level.

A  concerted  effort  is  also  being  made  to  co-ordinate  SMME   support
activities amongst the different departments within the province, to  ensure
that job creation efforts are maximised.  The  Free  State  government  also
initiated a consultative process throughout the province, so as  to  capture
the expectations  of  SMMEs  and  deal  with  aspects  such  as  affirmative
procurement which involve our black economic empowerment programme.

As a follow-up to the latter, a database is  being  established,  indicating
the type of business activity, ownership, size, skills  pools  and  capacity
of SMMEs  in  the  province  as  well  as  the  support  they  require  from
Government. As part of the new approach to SMME development, agreements  are
entered into with SMME service providers to perform certain functions  which
fall  outside  the  capabilities  of  the  Free  State  government  or   the
department. Funding is provided in accordance with the PFMA regulations.

We have also taken note of the service provided by  MAC,  the  manufacturing
advice centre. The Free State is not yet part of this programme, but  urgent
attention is being given to it. A  Brain  office  has  been  established  in
Bloemfontein which provides business and referral services to  SMMEs.  There
is, however, a need to spend more time in marketing  the  services  of  this
organisation, so that more SMMEs can be made aware of  it.  We  are  working
hard on this matter.

Access to finance is one of the most significant hampering  factors  in  the
SMME sector that we have observed.  Hence  the  fact  that  we  welcome  the
process that the Minister and  the  DTI  have  initiated  of  reviewing  the
mandate of Khula and the NEF, which will lead  to  an  integrated  financial
support service that meets the needs of the SMMEs.
Rural development is of crucial importance to us in the Free  State  as  the
larger part of the province is  rural.  It  is  important  in  our  struggle
against poverty  and  unemployment.  For  example,  the  Thabo  Mofutsanyana
region and the Xhariep district have the biggest concentration of  the  Free
State's  rural  population.  In  the  Thabo  Mofutsanyana  district,   which
includes the former homeland of Qwaqwa, we are busy with efforts to  develop
the potential the region has in the agroindustry. Hon  members  will  recall
that this is the district  that  has  one  of  the  developmental  nodes  as
announced by the President.

This potential growth is achieved through, amongst  other  things,  exposing
commercial and  emerging  farmers  to  opportunities  for  adding  value  to
traditional agricultural products such as fruit  juices,  canned  fruit  and
vegetables. New crops such as herbs and essential oils are also involved  in
our programme.

Various interesting projects are currently being  explored  in  the  Xhariep
region, namely the possibility of the cultivation of spirulina  as  well  as
the production of natural rubber. I could add here that  as  members  go  to
the exhibition stand, they will perhaps have an  opportunity  to  taste  the
Free State wine. I know that it will surprise many members to hear that  the
Free State is also in the business of producing wine.

As I move towards concluding, I wish to say that we thank the  Minister  and
his team for the manner in which they have led the provinces in getting  our
economic  activities  co-ordinated  in  a  very  healthy,  competitive   and
supportive manner.  We  do  believe  that  the  active  involvement  of  the
provinces in all matters of economic development  is  vital,  otherwise  the
strategy that has been put in place will be doomed. Continued  communication
and support between national and provincial government should be  maintained
at all times. It is for  that  reason  that  we  welcome  and  support  this
initiative.

The important role that local government has played ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon  member,  I
know  you  promised  us  wine,  but  your  time  has  expired.   [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs, hon colleagues, I  deliver
this speech on behalf of my colleague  Mr  Wikus  Theron,  who  is  away  on
parliamentary duties in Botswana.

The Department of Trade and Industry gets  a  Budget  Vote  of  almost  R2,5
billion to enhance the South African economy  and  make  it  internationally
more competitive. The main aims of the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry
include: firstly, to create conditions to  encourage  investment;  secondly,
to help South African exports; and thirdly to  regulate  the  South  African
market place.

In order to  achieve  the  above-mentioned  objectives,  the  department  is
divided into six divisions with the following allocations: administration  -
7% or  R169,5  million;  international  trade  development  -  3%  or  R65,9
million, enterprise and  industry  development  -  33%  or  R815,1  million;
consumer and corporate regulation - 5% or  R134,1  million;  the  Enterprise
Organisation - 34% or R840,1 million; and Trade and Investment South  Africa
- 18% or R443 million.

It can be seen from the above that a lot of money is spent on the  different
divisions of the department, but the  question  that  must  be  answered  is
whether this spending has the desired outcomes to promote the South  African
economy sufficiently. To be able to answer this, we  will  have  to  analyse
the operation's divisions very closely.

In the trade category, two  divisions  could  be  analysed  to  judge  their
influences  or  outputs.  Firstly,  the  international   trade   development
division is aimed at creating conditions conducive to South African  exports
by negotiating international trade agreements. An amount  of  R65,9  million
will be spent on this division with its five subdivisions, namely  bilateral
agreements,  regional  trade  block  agreements,  multilateral   agreements,
international trade development, trade policy and analysis.

It is worth mentioning that the old Board  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  will  be
replaced by the new Commission for International Trade Administration.  This
will be our independent regulatory agency, and obviously a lot  of  work  is
needed here to free up international  trade  by  breaking  down  the  tariff
barriers.

Secondly, the R443,6 million trade and investment  programme  has  two  main
elements, namely investment promotion and export  promotion.  In  these  two
areas, the DTI is doing critically  important  work  in  the  South  African
economy, which should be expanded. Investment South Africa boasts that  they
delivered R4,6 billion in  foreign  direct  investment,  or  FDI,  which  is
commendable. But, as we all know, South Africa  needs  much  more  FDI,  and
great strides must be made in this critical area of our economy.

Under the broad category of industry, two of the  DTI's  projects  could  be
included,  namely  enterprise  and  industry  development,  and   enterprise
organisation. Enterprise and industry development is  getting  a  budget  of
R815 million. The  programme  of  this  division  includes  competitiveness,
enterprise development and black  economic  empowerment.  As  we  all  know,
black economic empowerment is a top priority  for  the  DTI.  Great  strides
have been made here, but we ask: Why is  it  so  quiet  regarding  the  taxi
recapitalisation project  at  the  moment?  We  can  only  hope  that  great
improvements will  follow  soon  in  this  critical  area  for  millions  of
commuters in our country.

On enterprise and industry development we can only say that a  lot  of  work
is waiting, and we need this development urgently to create jobs  to  remedy
the very high unemployment rate  in  the  country.  Enterprise  organisation
receives the biggest allocation of all the DTI  programmes.  The  amount  of
R840 million provides incentives and support to sustainable enterprises.

We are very grateful that the DTI is  in  the  process  of  reviewing  these
incentives and has already replaced some of the old schemes.  In  the  past,
most of the emphasis was on manufacturing enterprises,  but  recently  other
industries  such  as  aquaculture,   tourism,   agroprocessing,   high-value
agricultural products and biotechnology are also targeted.

The SMME sector is also getting much more attention and investment, as  well
as  black  economic  empowerment   and   enhancing   the   role   of   women
entrepreneurs.  We  applaud  these  developments  and   hope   that   bigger
investment will  follow  in  these  critical  areas  of  the  South  African
economy.

The consumer and corporate  regulation  division  only  gets  5%  or  R134,1
million from the budget. However, it has a very important  task  to  fulfil,
such as the regulation of the liquor, gambling and  lottery  industries,  as
well as commercial, competition and  consumer  protection  policies  in  the
interests of both producers and consumers. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms N P NKONYENI (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson,  hon  Minister  of  Trade  and
Industry, hon MECs, hon members of  this  House  and  delegates  from  other
provinces, it gives me great pleasure to be  afforded  this  opportunity  to
remind the South African nation of one of the clauses of the  ANC's  Freedom
Charter, which provides that, and I quote: ``The people shall share  in  the
country's wealth''. The hon the Minister's mandate is  to  ensure  that  the
people of South Africa are sharing equally the  wealth  accumulated  through
the hard labour performed by the inhabitants  of  this  state  in  order  to
enhance the means of production.

The aim of  this  department  fascinates  me.  Its  aim  is  to  manage  and
facilitate access to sustainable economic activity and  employment  for  all
employable South Africans through higher levels of investment,  etc.  I  can
proudly mention that the department is somehow achieving  its  goals,  as  I
read recently in  the  media  that  the  number  of  foreign  consumers  who
purchase South African goods is increasing. Of course, that is good for  our
country.

This department will never be able to pursue and achieve its  goals  all  by
itself. That is why  the  noble  decision  was  taken  by  our  capable  and
rational Cabinet Ministers,  led  by  our  hon  President  Thabo  Mbeki,  to
cluster  departments  so  as  to  promote  the  integration  of   government
departments, thereby also promoting and enhancing good governance.

It is exciting to learn that our hon President is determined to ensure  that
Government will increasingly focus  on  microeconomic  reform  in  order  to
address burning economic and social issues. It  is  also  exciting  to  note
that a range of input sectors have  been  identified,  particularly  energy,
telecommunications and transport, where costs need to be brought  into  line
with global prices in order to enhance the competitiveness of enterprises.

I would like to concur with the Minister that  there  are  priority  sectors
which have a high potential for growth and employment, such as  agriculture,
tourism, information and communication technology, and cultural  industries.
Export  sectors  such  as  clothing  and  textiles,  automotive  components,
agroprocessing, metals and beneficiated minerals are also important.

I have scrutinised and analysed this budget and  I  am  wondering  how  much
effort was expended by the department to  ensure  that  it  is  not  gender-
blind. No budget is gender-neutral. It is either gender-sensitive or gender-
blind. The hon the Minister's department has six programmes, as  is  clearly
stipulated.  They  are  administration,  international  trade   development,
enterprise and industry  development,  consumer  and  corporate  regulation,
enterprise  organisation,  which  promotes  domestic   and   foreign   fixed
investment, and Trade and Investment South Africa. Can the hon the  Minister
convince South African women that all these programmes  will  benefit  them,
improve their economic status and enhance gender  equality?  But  anyway,  I
have learnt from the Minister's budget speech that he is doing something  to
enhance and promote gender equality in his department.

Women will never be apologetic when raising these  issues.  I  always  quote
the slogan of the DPSA, which says, ``Nothing about us without  us''.  I  am
here representing South African women, so I will always  articulate  gender-
related issues on their behalf. I congratulate the Minister  for  initiating
programmes which aim at managing technology for women in business.

Ake ngicele kulo  mNyango  kaNgqongqoshe  ohloniphekile,  uMnu  Alec  Erwin,
ukuthi ake ukuqaphele okwenzayo kulolu hlelo olungaphansi  kwe-consumer  and
corporate regulations  oluqondene  nokuqaphela  ukuqondiswa  komhlahlandlela
wezokugembula, ukudayiswa kotshwala kanye neLotto. Kumanje nje,  ngoMgqibelo
wokuqala  enyangeni  kaJulayi,  sizobona  izinsizwa   nezintokazi   zivunele
ziconsa   ngenhloso   yokuyozibonela   amahhashi   etshakadula   eGreyville,
eThekwini.  Abantu  abampisholo  njengami,  abakavulelwa  amathuba  okubamba
iqhaza kule  mboni.  Ngithi  umhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe  ake  aziphe  ithuba,
acubungule lolu daba.

Ngijabule   kakhulu   ukuzwa   ukuthi    uthe    umhlonishwa    uNgqongqoshe
bayalucubungula  udaba  lweNtsika   neKhula   ngoba   lusikhalisa   kakhulu.
Akubonakali  kahle  hle  ukuthi  kwenziwani.  Okunye  okujabulisayo   ukuthi
kucutshungulwa  indlela   yokubambisana   phakathi   kukaHulumeni   omkhulu,
ohulumeni bezifundazwe kanye nomasipala ukuze  kunqandwe  ukuhluthahluthana,
lapho omunye ekhomba khona omunye esweni omunye ebe evikela iso lakhe.

Ngiyamhalalisela  uNgqongqoshe  kwisabiwomali  somNyango  wakhe   aphathiswe
wona.  Akusheshi-ke  nokho  ukubonakala  komkhiqizo  kodwa   igalelo   lakhe
seliyabonakala, ikakhulukazi ngokuba  khona  kwezinhlelo  ezifana  no-Brain.
(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to ask the Ministry of the hon Alec Erwin  to  be  careful  of
what it is doing in this programme that falls under consumer  and  corporate
regulations, since it is responsible for  regulating  gambling,  selling  of
alcohol and the Lotto. On Saturday in July we will see  well-dressed  ladies
and gentlemen attending the horse race in Greyville,  Durban.  Black  people
like myself  have  not  been  given  opportunities  to  take  part  in  this
industry. Therefore, I would like to ask the hon  Minister  that  he  should
give himself a chance to look at this issue.

I am happy to hear that the hon Minister said they were  solving  the  issue
of Ntsika and Khula because it worries us greatly. We do  not  see  what  is
being done. What pleases me also is that they are  looking  at  the  way  in
which the national Government can co-operate with provincial  and  municipal
governments to solve conflict in cases where they blame one another.

I would like to congratulate  the  Minister  on  the  budget  given  to  his
department. The product is not readily  visible,  but  his  efforts  can  be
seen, especially  with  regard  to  the  establishment  of  programmes  like
Brain.]

I come from a province which is the  second  highest  contributor  to  South
Africa's GDP. So, I would urge the Minister to  see  to  it  that  there  is
adequate ploughing back to the people  of  that  province.  Let  sustainable
jobs  be  created.  I  am  from  a  province  that  is  capable  of  hosting
international conventions. I come from a province with tourist  attractions,
greenery  and  oceans,  and  where  the  Lobombo  SDI  has  been  initiated.
Ngiqhamuka kwelikamoba nobhanana. [I come  from  the  land  of  bananas  and
sugarcane.] I am from the kingdom of the Zulus, where cultural  events  such
as reed  dances,  umkhosi  wokweshwama  [first  crops  ceremony]  and  other
cultural activities attract national and international communities.

KwaZulu-Natal, with its capable MEC, hon Michael Mabuyakhulu,  ensures  that
previously  disadvantaged  communities  benefit  from  SMME  programmes.  He
ensures that Batho Pele  principles  are  adhered  to  by  all  departmental
officials.

Having said all that, allow me to congratulate the Minister  for  the  well-
articulated budget  speech  and  let  me  support  the  budget.  [Applause.]
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Can  you  stop
your Mbongeni Ngema?
Mr J I MABENA (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, hon Minister, colleagues, MECs  and
hon members of this House, there is no doubt that our national  economy  has
shown signs of great improvement  and  is  very  resilient.  This  has  been
brought about by the difficult policy choices that we made in an attempt  to
place our economy on a sustainable growth path.

I must say that I agree fully with Minister Erwin that the economy  we  have
today is  fundamentally  and  irreversibly  different  from  that  which  we
inherited in 1994. The same can be said of the  provincial  economy  of  our
own province and the number  of  flaws  and  weaknesses  we  inherited,  key
amongst which was the income leakage that was caused by  the  fact  that  we
were not adding value to our raw materials in the province.

Globalisation is one of the major challenges we face and  will  continue  to
face to an increasing degree during this decade. We are now confronted  with
what is normally termed a new economy, which is adding more pressure on  our
society as proficiency in information and communications technology  becomes
a prerequisite in building a dynamic and adaptive economy. It is  heartening
to know, as the Deputy President explained earlier on this  afternoon,  that
our human resource development strategy is geared towards  the  creation  of
this proficiency, especially among the young people of this country.

We are encouraged that the department,  in  line  with  the  theme  of  this
year's Budget of reducing poverty, inequality and vulnerability, decided  to
direct a big chunk of their resources to the most vulnerable sector  of  our
society. As the provincial government we are  still  convinced  that  it  is
through the promotion and development of the SMME sector  that  our  people,
the previously disadvantaged, will be able to participate  in  the  economic
mainstream.

We must find solutions to some  of  the  most  challenging  obstacles  still
faced by the SMME sector, including access to  finance,  which  remains  the
mother of all problems facing this important sector of the economy. We  must
find ways of supporting especially  the  high-capital  risk  phase  in  SMME
development, the preproduction  phase,  especially  when  it  comes  to  the
development of the manufacturing sector. We  have,  as  Mpumalanga,  set  in
place a  number  of  institutions,  key  amongst  which  is  the  Mpumalanga
Economic Empowerment Corporation.

Jointly with the Italian governmment, through Unops, we are setting up  what
we call the Nkomasi Economic Development Agency in one of our poor  regions,
which will be an economic development agency that will also offer  a  credit
facility. At the end of last year, as the provincial government, we  took  a
decision to spend R114 million from own revenue to capitalise some of  these
institutions. The Mpumalanga Training Trust has also  embarked  on  a  major
training programme linked to our Operation Sivuselela  Ezorhwebo,  which  is
aimed at training emerging entrepreneurs but  also  offers  funding  through
the Mpumalanga Economic Empowerment Corporation.

I believe that the further strengthening of local business  service  centres
and strong monitoring of accounting systems  is  also  an  area  that  needs
special attention. We hope that the intended positive steps to be  taken  by
the DTI relating to institutions such as Khula and Ntsika will  be  able  to
consolidate the achievements  attained  so  far  and  also  expand  economic
opportunities for SMMEs. We  have  six  accredited  local  business  service
centres, but, of course they need to be strengthened, as I  said,  in  terms
of monitoring and accounting systems.

One also wishes to welcome the effective  and  efficient  systems  that  the
department has put in place to ensure that it operates faster,  smarter  and
quicker  in  delivering  services,   particularly   with   regard   to   the
registration of  companies  or  close  corporations  at  the  Companies  and
Intellectual Property Office. We really appreciate the  positive  turnaround
and the positive developments in this important area of work.

One wishes to commend the  department  for  putting  more  emphasis  on  the
development of the survivalist  sector,  a  sector  that  consumes  a  large
proportion of the budget, especially in the rural provinces  such  as  ours.
One hopes that the  DTI's  plans  to  hive  the  funding  of  this  sector's
enterprises off to a new fund will  not  only  help  Khula  to  refocus  its
activities but also assist Government and other  stakeholders  to  pay  more
attention to  the  development  of  this  sector  if  enterprises  from  the
disadvantaged communities are to  make  a  meaningful  contribution  towards
economic growth and job creation.

In the provinces more assistance and information  sharing  between  the  DTI
and  other  stakeholders  will  be  required  as  the   different   economic
strategies are rolled out. We have to come to grips with strategies such  as
the Micro-economic Reform Strategy and Integrated Manufacturing Strategy.  I
want to emphasise the question of improved co-ordination between  the  three
spheres  of  government,  especially  as  far  as  investment  promotion  is
concerned. It is important for us to  co-ordinate  because  we  seem  to  be
sending the wrong signals outside in terms of our  own  economic  plan.  The
Department of Provincial and Local Government  organises  trips,  mainly  to
China, with all the mayors participating. When they come back we  find  that
they have promised an auto plant, when actually, in terms  of  the  strategy
of the country, maybe the auto industry should rather be  developed  in  the
Eastern Cape or Gauteng.

That interaction is very important,  all  the  more  so  because  there  are
professional conference attendees in some of these countries. I  always  say
that if we all put our collections of business cards on the table, we  would
find that we have spoken to the same  person,  especially  in  some  of  the
countries in the Far East. I am just emphasising the question of  investment
co-ordination because it creates a lot of  expectations.  Mayors  come  back
and announce very big projects with thousands  of  jobs.  They  raise  false
expectations. I am emphasising the point of  intergovernment  co-ordination.
I could not agree more with the Minister on the need to  focus  our  efforts
on how to further  exploit  our  endowments  and  comparative  advantage  in
sectors like agriculture and mining.

In agriculture investigations have revealed that  there  are  many  products
that can be produced from sugar cane beyond sucrose and  molasses  in  terms
of vitamins and assets that are important in other industries. Some  of  our
provinces have dimension stones like Belfast black granite  or  the  granite
that is currently shipped out of the country  for  beneficiation  elsewhere.
Where value addition does not take place locally, the  products,  which  are
household furniture made of granite,  are  very  expensive  and  beyond  the
reach not only of ordinary people, but even of many members of  this  House,
and yet we have the best quality granites.

So our  province's  industrial  development  strategy  to  deal  with  these
weaknesses of income linkage, caused by the fact that we do  not  add  value
in  our  province,  puts  a  lot  of  emphasis  on  manufacturing.  We  have
established industrial clusters. We have an industrial cluster approach.  We
have the world's fifth-largest stainless steel producer,  Columbus,  located
in our province, but as a province we have said that it is  not  enough  for
us to go abroad and boast that we have the world's fifth  largest  stainless
steel plant. Through this stainless  steel  and  this  cluster  approach  we
managed to set up a stainless steel incubator. We know what we  can  produce
in terms of hollowware and some of the products that  we  can  produce  from
stainless steel.

When we go out we set up projects that promote beneficiation.  In  terms  of
agro industry we have an agro food and an agro nonfood cluster.  We  produce
a lot of subtropical fruits. We produce sugar, maize,  sunflowers  and  soya
beans, and of late we have produced the  Pink  Lady  apples  that  are  very
popular in Europe and reach the  European  market  two  weeks  earlier  than
those from the Western Cape. I am not saying this  to  spite  my  colleagues
from the Western Cape. We will co-operate, as the Minister said.

We are in the process  of  setting  up  a  packhouse  because  there  is  an
abnormal situation. We have a packhouse, we grow the fruit in  the  orchards
but we pack it in Bethlehem in the Free State and export through Cape  Town,
which is a three-and-a-half day turnaround. But if we had the  packhouse  in
Ermelo, about 20 km from the orchards, and exported through Maputo,  if  the
harbour development continues, there would be a quick turnaround.

We have an agro nonfood cluster which focuses on wool. We produce 6  million
kilograms of wool, 4 million of which is quality wool, but it is  washed  in
Durban and its value addition is done in the Eastern  Cape.  Then  it  comes
back to Mpumalanga, to the wool textile facilities in Standerton. But in co-
operation with the Eastern Cape government, we have  set  up  a  small  wool
cluster in that area. In  the  Ermelo  area,  because  of  the  reliance  on
minerals and energy,  when  power  stations  closed  down  a  lot  of  mines
collapsed. The biggest  employer  today  is  the  Government.  We  are  also
looking at the petrochemical cluster, because we have Sasol 2 and  3.  There
are enormous opportunities for value addition  to  many  of  the  feedstocks
from the coal-to-oil process in terms of polymers and the polypropylene  for
domestic  plastic  products   and   toys.   We   are   investigating   these
opportunities.
Through the Department For International  Development  we  have  managed  to
secure funds.  There  is  a  thorough  investigation  looking  at  both  the
stainless steel cluster and the petrochemical clusters and what it  is  that
we can produce from the 120 or so petrochemical feedstocks from Sasol.

We have a tourism growth plan that  has  divided  our  province  into  seven
regions for industrial,  adventure,  agro,  cultural,  heritage  and  sports
tourism. We do have tourism cluster.

When coming to the challenges, we sit with these areas that  suffered  as  a
result of policy decisions that we took,  especially  when  we  restructured
the energy sector. They became ghost towns. We are grappling with  this  and
looking at what is possible. But one is confident, and we  believe  that  it
is only countries or economies that add value to their  raw  materials  that
can  benefit.  One  major  challenge  is  the  development  of   medium-size
companies, and we are, as the  provincial  government,  determined  to  fund
this process.

I think the DTI entrepreneurial training initiative must be welcomed as  the
development of an entrepreneurial culture together with the funding  of  the
high-capital-risk phase is important, not  only  in  SMME  development,  but
even more so in building joint venture capacity among local  businesses.  We
have discovered as we promote investment that there is  a  lot  of  capacity
for joint ventures at local level.

When we investigated we discovered that unless we support the  high-capital-
risk phase, followed by the entrepreneurial  culture  development,  we  will
not  be  in   a   position   to   encourage   those   businesspeople.   This
entrepreneurial training is important and will have  a  positive  impact  as
the train moves across the  country.  It  is  an  initiative  that  must  be
welcomed.

I would like to support  what  the  Minister  said,  that  partnerships  and
collective action are the only mechanisms capable of taking  us  forward  in
the long term. Our new economic path requires new  ways  of  organising.  It
requires knowledge networks, the sharing of best practice and the  diffusion
of new technologies amongst enterprises.

In conclusion, I believe that if we  really  build  these  partnerships  and
take collective action, we will be in  a  position  to  answer  the  central
question President Mbeki referred to in the  state  of  the  nation  address
around the impact our programmes have in lifting the intolerable  burden  of
poverty and underdevelopment  from  the  shoulders  of  the  masses  of  our
people. [Applause.]]

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, may I thank the Minister and his department  for
the new format and for the new presentation. I think it will also  encourage
economic activity at provincial level and give  new  meaning  to  the  whole
question of concurrent jurisdiction. We thank  the  Minister  for  the  fact
that it is more understandable.

I can also see, bearing in  mind  that  the  lead  times  are  long  in  the
Minister's business, that many of the programmes which  the  DTI  started  a
few years ago  have  managed  to  come  through.  Congratulations  on  that.
Unhappily, time will not allow me to touch on too many things,  but  I  will
touch on one thing that my party feels quite strongly about, although it  is
perhaps not the a popular thing to talk about, and that is gambling.

My party is totally against gambling. We voted against all  the  legislation
when came through, and we are still against it. We asked the  question:  How
does one transform a society that demands that decadence be  tolerated  even
if it is flaunted in the way that we flaunt  it?  We  have  so  much  to  be
grateful for in our society, but the key  question  remains:  Are  we  as  a
nation turning the tide against the current  moral  disintegration  and  the
sense of hopelessness that goes with it, which is  contributed  to,  in  our
view, by gambling?

I do not want to dwell upon the  merits  of  it  now,  but  simply  ask  the
Minister the question: Does he think that the public are getting  value  for
money?  I  am  asking  this  question  against   the   background   of   the
investigation that the Minister is currently conducting  into  the  gambling
industry. I think  the  Minister  mentioned  that  he  was  looking  at  the
legislation. I would like to ask the  people  in  this  House,  just  as  an
experiment, how many millions they think it takes to regulate  the  gambling
industry in South Africa - R10 million, R20  million,  R30  million  or  R40
million. [Interjections.]

We have 10 gambling boards in South Africa run by 10 chairmen with  10  CEOs
and staffed by 274 officials spending R121 470 000 per annum to regulate  an
industry which is failing to  deliver  taxes  in  any  significant  way.  An
industry which has brought huge social  costs  and  human  misery  and  very
little public benefit, an industry  which  has  diverted  income  from  more
productive  avenues  of  expenditure  such  as  food,  education,   housing,
clothing and looking after families, wives and children, to  self-indulgence
and deviant behaviour. We have an industry which has, in my view, a  bloated
and overinflated bureaucracy regulating gambling.

I choose these words carefully because I am not trying  to  be  funny  about
this. I honestly do not know if, with regard to the  motor  industry,  which
is a brilliant industry because  it  is  doing  so  well,  one  spends  R121
million regulating it. I do not think one does. I will look at  the  figures
- but I do not think one does - or anywhere near that amount.  I  know  that
we must be careful of decentralisation that goes beserk in our  country.  To
have these nine or ten bodies regulating this industry ...!

For one thing, one has a Minister, a chairman and a  CEO  earning  about  R1
million and one has two staff. How does one  explain  the  chairman  of  the
Western Cape Gambling Board getting paid a R681 909 payment  per  annum?  He
has a CEO who is earning over R400 000 - so the two of  them  earn  over  R1
million. They have 27  people,  I  think,  on  their  staff,  and  they  are
regulating two or three casinos, which are run by big public companies  that
are perfectly capable of regulating them themselves.

How does one explain that the chairman in the Western Cape earns R681 000  -
I am serious when I say this - while the chairman in Gauteng earns  R12 000?
He is doing the same job;  a  much  bigger  job  probably.  [Interjections.]
[Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Let us call  on
the  hon  member  Rasool.  Maybe  he  has  been  convinced  about  gambling.
[Interjections.]

Mr E RASOOL (Western Cape): Chairperson, I am one of the newest  members  to
this particular kind of debate, so I come here with a lot more  trepidation.
I was trying to use the latest device that was  invented  in  our  province,
and that is to delegate my ceremonial and  public  duties  to  someone  else
while I sit in my office. [Laughter.] But I am told  that  I  need  to  have
earned  some  Deutschmarks  in  order  to  qualify   for   that   privilege.
[Laughter.] Now I have not done that. So I have to deliver a very  imperfect
contribution to this debate.

However, I would like Mr  Durr  to  bring  that  speech  to  the  provincial
legislature, because I think it certainly merits quite a bit  of  discussion
in order for us to look at some  of  the  figures  and  the  needs  that  he
raises. I want to treat that fairly seriously and ask that he bring this  to
the provincial legislature.

I would like to congratulate the Minister on the kind of format that he  has
brought to this discussion and also for the work generally that the DTI  has
been doing - the intensive focus on microeconomic reform. I  think  that  on
the back of successful macroeconomic policies, we can push that forward  and
deal with the need to grow the economy, to grow job  creation,  to  decrease
economic inequalities and to improve our competitiveness.

I also  think  that  the  integrated  manufacturing  strategy  the  Minister
brought to this debate is clearly needed. I think the country and  certainly
our province are ready for this strategy. I would also like to  welcome  the
very practical co-operation that he brings to the discussions around how  we
take forward  the  economy  among  the  different  provinces  and  different
spheres of government.

I would like  to  add  immediately  that  under  the  ANC  and  the  New  NP
government in the Western Cape, we cease to be simply competitive  with  the
other provinces and begin to understand the need to  co-operate  with  other
provinces and other  spheres  of  government.  If  there  is  any  immediate
visible change in what we bring as a new Government to this debate, it is  a
spirit of co-operation and a matching of the different  advantages  that  we
have to those others may have in other provinces,  and  the  hope  that  the
national Government can be brought into this.

I would want to say that the Western Cape is characterised  by  a  range  of
economic activities with no single industrial sector dominating  the  region
and the economy. I am glad  that  the  Minister  has  made  the  point  that
agriculture, manufacturing, trade, tourism and financial  services  are  but
some of these activities.

The diversity of the Western Cape industrial structure, I  think,  has  much
to do with its distance from Gauteng. So one does not have sectors  such  as
the ICT sector - the  information  and  communication  technology  sector  -
naturally gravitating towards Gauteng's strong economy, but  being  able  to
settle here.

I also want to say that the Western Cape department of economic  development
has identified sectors that we specifically want to target and improve  upon
in terms of the competitiveness of  those  sectors.  These  sectors  include
agribusiness, clothing  and  textiles,  furniture,  biotechnology,  ICT  and
metal fabrication. We think that those are the sectors  which  we  could  be
developing even further, and developing - if we were to do that -  what  one
calls the potential of the Western Cape.

We also understand that we have to do this within a strategic  framework  in
which the human resource capacity of the province must be developed.  If  we
are going to develop that potential we cannot have  a  situation  in  which,
for example, the majority of our students do  not  even  meet  a  maths  and
science teacher as they go through primary and secondary  school.  Therefore
there must be a human resource plan on the table for that.

I think we must understand that we have  to  gear  up  our  economy  towards
trade and, particularly, export, and get ourselves export  ready,  otherwise
we will not be seizing the various opportunities which are opening up.

We understand that this must be within a strategic framework  in  which  the
SMME sector is actively developed and not left behind. We  also  understand,
and want to put on the agenda here, that black economic empowerment  has  to
become central to whatever we do, because while the Western Cape  has  great
potential and great economic growth potential,  it  also  has  the  greatest
discrepancy between  the  highest  income  earners  and  the  lowest  income
earners. So unless  we  make  black  economic  empowerment  central  to  our
agenda, we are not going to bring our province into harmony with itself.

The main objectives of our framework are  to  rapidly  evolve  a  knowledge-
based economy in the Western  Cape  for  industries  to  become  innovative,
productive and able to  compete  internationally,  and  also  to  deliver  a
quality of life for all in our province and in our country.

This emphasis on a knowledge-based economy that we want to  develop  with  a
human resource plan, will hopefully result in the  nurturing  of  the  high-
value manufacturing capacity that the Minister spoke about  in  his  speech.
For example, we see the clothing and textile industry, which  employs  about
170 000 people and any number of  people  up  to  50  000  in  the  informal
clothing sector through the CMT - the cut, make and trim  groups  -  as  the
single biggest and most significant industrial source of employment  in  the
Western Cape.

We believe if we were to add design to this industry - with that  aspect  of
the knowledge economy - we would be  to  capture  niche  markets  and  offer
unique products in a more competitive environment. So those  are  the  kinds
of things that we are challenged by.

We look, for example, to the port of Cape Town, which plays  a  considerable
role  in  the  regional  economy.  Now  even  though  the  port   has   many
inefficiencies, it is one of the largest deep-water harbours in Africa  able
to handle the largest container vessels afloat and, as  a  wide-mouth  port,
it can handle extraordinary vessels, such as the steady  flow  of  oil  rigs
which use our port for maintenance and repair.

The port of Cape Town also has a  sophisticated  ship  repair  centre  which
brings in approximately R500 million to the Cape economy.  Now,  how  do  we
position this port to become the major service port for the  burgeoning  oil
industry along Africa's west coast and dovetail that  with  the  R6  billion
Kudu megaprojects which pipe gas from the west coast through to the rest  of
the Western Cape. Those are the kinds of challenges that we are faced with.

Similarly, the Cape Town International Convention Centre, which  is  a  R600
million investment, helps us in part to  overcome  the  seasonality  of  the
Western Cape's tourism industry by growing  the  exhibition  and  conference
potential of the Western Cape and bringing in people all year  round.  Those
are some of the issues that we are speaking about.

I also want to  say  that  we  are  desperately  keen  to  overcome  spacial
inequity, particularly in Cape Town and in the Western Cape as a  whole.  We
see a concentration of development along the northwest corridor,  which  has
traditionally been the better off corridor of the  Western  Cape  along  the
N1. This is where one finds the largest concentration of  privileged  people
living.

We need to shift the axis of that infrastructural investment  to  also  take
cognisance of the needs of those on the southeast sector. So,  for  example,
we are looking at expansions around the airport  which  take  us  into  that
southeast corridor. The development of the first phase of the  650  hectares
of land surrounding the aviation infrastructure has already  begun  in  this
regard.

We are looking at the Khayelitsha business centre, which is at  an  advanced
stage,  to   combine   commercial,   administrative,   recreational,   light
industrial and transport-focused investments on the vast  vacant  area  east
of the Khayelitsha station. The search for  private-public  partnerships  to
co-fund that is under way.

We could combine that, for example, with  plans  to  develop  the  Mitchells
Plain industrial park. There we have a R500 million industrial park  located
to the north of the major retail centre.  This  provides  opportunities  for
the development of both retail and light industrial activities.

This industrial park is ideally situated to  service  Philippi,  Khayelitsha
and Mitchells Plain. If we  were  to  combine  these  and  fast-track  their
development for the next two years, a major economic contribution  would  be
made to the urban renewal node that was announced by the President. This  is
not just a simple concentration of houses  and  social  infrastructure,  but
also, together with the Khayelitsha  business  district,  a  major  economic
investment.

In similar vein, I want to speak about the  Philippi  business  developments
and the Wetton-Landsdowne corridor to the southeast of Cape Town. There  are
plans for a R1 billion  commercial  and  office  investment  package,  which
includes a wholesale and fresh produce market, a new railway station, a  bus
terminus at Stock Road, a 200-bed hospital,  community  facilities  and  the
expansion of Philippi industria. The total  package,  spread  over  five  to
eight years, could add up to  more  than  R3  billion.  Those  would  become
significant things we do.

Similarly, a new plant for the manufacturer of refrigerator stainless  steel
containers is to be built in the Cape winelands  town,  Paarl,  which  again
starts to shift where we allocate that  kind  of  infrastructure,  and  this
will cater for both local  and  foreign  markets.  The  total  cost  of  the
project will be in the region of R200 million, and 40% of this  has  already
been secured.

So, unlike our colleagues in Gauteng who are able to put a lot of  money  on
top with their Blue IQ, I think we are far more challenged to  find  how  we
spend money in our existing infrastructure budgets in the  Western  Cape  in
order to make progress in this, and we are desperately  challenged  to  find
the kind of public-private partnerships that are able to drive these  things
forward.

So we are having to fast-track a lot of the changes in  priorities  that  we
have had to make in the past six months and that we will continue  to  make.
But, I think, we are challenged by the kind of frameworks  set  by  the  DTI
nationally. Increasingly, from the Western Cape, we will come to the  party,
but we just need to match two things,  and  they  are  how  we  continue  to
exploit the great potential that we have in the Western Cape while,  at  the
same time, spreading the base of ownership of the provincial economy. If  we
can get those kinds of things right, then we will  start  to  play  catch-up
much faster than was the case before. I thank the House for the  opportunity
to put these ideas to the Minister. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Mnr die Voorsitter,  Minister  Erwin,  lede  van  uitvoerende
rade en kollegas, die Departement van Handel en  Nywerheid  het  onlangs  'n
belangrike   besprekingsdokument   vrygestel   oor   versnelde   groei    en
ontwikkeling en die  bydrae  van  'n  geïntegreerde  vervaardigingstrategie.
Hierdie dokument kan na my mening  met  reg  as  een  van  die  waardevoller
bydraes   tot   die   denke   en   toepassing   van   'n    strategie    oor
nywerheidsontwikkeling van die afgelope dekade beskou word.

Ek wil graag kortliks na 'n paar  punte  daarin  verwys.  Die  kern  van  'n
vervaardigingstrategie is om die bestaande nywerheidstruktuur  as  basis  te
neem en die implikasies daarvan vir moontlike toekomstige  ontwikkeling  van
die ekonomie te ontleed. Dit moet die keuses aandui en die  prioriteite  van
die hoofareas vir optrede deur die Regering bepaal.

Die Suid-Afrikaanse  nywerheidswese  beskik  weliswaar  oor  gesofistikeerde
produksietegnieke en hoogs  ontwikkelde  swaarnywerhede,  maar  het  in  die
laaste dekade nie daarin geslaag om noemenswaardige nuwe werkgeleenthede  te
skep nie, wat daarop  neerkom  dat  vele  bedrywe  in  oorlewingsaktiwiteite
betrokke is.

Die uitdagings en dringendheid ten  opsigte  van  die  ontwikkeling  van  'n
vervaardigingstrategie  moet  dus  nie  onderskat  word  nie.  Die  algemene
konsensus  is  dat  die  departement  se   beleidsdokument   'n   belangrike
voorwaartse stap in dié rigting is. Dit blyk ook uit die identifisering  van
die hoofuitdagings en prioriteite, en  die  noodsaaklikheid  om  van  makro-
ekonomiese stabiliteit na mikro-ekonomiese aksie oor te skakel.

Die mikro-ekonomiese hervormingstrategie se visie vir die jaar 2014  is  vir
'n gestruktureerde en aanpasbare  ekonomie  wat  gekarakteriseer  word  deur
groei,  indiensneming  en  ekwiteit,  en  wat  gebaseer  is  op  die   volle
potensiaal van alle persone, gemeenskappe en geografiese areas. As sulks  is
die geïntegreerde vervaardigingstrategie 'n belangrike fondament  waarop  'n
kollektiewe benadering ten opsigte van  die  indiensnemingsdoelwitte  en  'n
breër  en  billiker  groei  gebou  kan  word.  (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Dr E A  CONROY:  Mr  Chairperson,  Minister  Erwin,  members  of  executive
councils and colleagues, the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  recently
released  an  important  discussion  document  on  accelerated  growth   and
development and the contribution of an  integrated  manufacturing  strategy.
In my opinion, this document can rightly  be  viewed  as  one  of  the  more
valuable contributions to the thinking on and application of a  strategy  on
industrial development of the past decade.

I would like to refer briefly to a few  points  in  it.  The  essence  of  a
manufacturing strategy is to take the existing  industrial  structure  as  a
basis  and  to  analyse  the  implications  thereof  for   possible   future
development of the economy. It must indicate the choices and  determine  the
priorities of the primary areas for action by the Government.

South African industry certainly  has  sophisticated  production  techniques
and highly developed heavy industries, but in the last  decade  it  has  not
succeeded in creating significant new job opportunities,  which  means  that
many industries are involved in activities for survival.

The  challenges  and  urgency  with  regard  to  the  development   of   the
manufacturing strategy must therefore not  be  underestimated.  The  general
consensus is that the department's policy  document  is  an  important  step
forward in this direction. This is also apparent from the identification  of
the primary challenges and  priorities,  and  the  necessity  to  move  from
macroeconomic stability to microeconomic action.

The microeconomic reform strategy's vision  for  the  year  2014  is  for  a
structured  and  adjusted  economy  which  is   characterised   by   growth,
employment and equity, and which is based  on  the  full  potential  of  all
people,  communities  and  geographic  areas.   As   such   the   integrated
manufacturing strategy is an important  foundation  on  which  a  collective
approach with regard to the  employment  objectives  and  broader  and  more
reasonable growth can be built.]

The requirements to realise this vision include  a  geographical  spread  of
social  and  productive  investment;  an  integrated  manufacturing  economy
capable of high degrees of value  added;  an  extensive  ICT  and  logistics
system capable of speed and flexibility; a  high  degree  of  knowledge  and
technology capacity;  skilled,  informed  and  adaptable  citizens;  and  an
efficient, strong and responsive state structure.

The key themes raised  in  the  document  were,  inter  alia,  manufacturing
strategy, industrial policy and industrial strategy; the role of  the  state
from dialogue  to  collective  action;  exports  and  trade  liberalisation;
investment patterns and foreign direct investments; pricing  of  inputs  and
input parity pricing - in  short,  an  impressive  list  of  very  important
topics and aspects.

Hierdie dokument is ongetwyfeld  'n  groot  stap  in  die  rigting  van  die
ontwikkeling  van  'n  toepaslike  nywerheidsbeleid  waarmee  die   ekonomie
gereoriënteer kan word, sodat die doelstellings van 'n  breëbasis  groei  en
werkskepping bereik kan word. Ek wil graag die  Departement  van  Handel  en
Nywerheid gelukwens daarmee.

Die  Nuwe  NP  steun  hierdie  begrotingspos.  [Applous.]  (Translation   of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This  document  is  undoubtedly  a  big  step  in  the  direction  of   the
development of an applicable industrial policy with which  the  economy  can
be reoriented, so that the objectives of broad-base growth and job  creation
can be achieved. I would like to congratulate the Department  of  Trade  and
Industry on it.

The New NP supports this Vote. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF TRADE  AND  INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  I  will  not  keep  hon
members long because we know that Cape Town benefits by  getting  food  from
all over South Africa and having  some  wonderful  restaurants.  I  am  sure
there are many hon members here do not want to hear much of what I  have  to
say. But let me comment very briefly on  certain  points  some  hon  members
made and thank others for the contributions that they have made.

Very briefly, just to indicate, the new DTI  campus  and  building  will  be
located in Pretoria and not, as Mr Moosa said, in Johannesburg,  but  it  is
an exciting project. It is, to the best of my knowledge, the  largest  full-
service provision of public-private partnership that is  being  launched  in
South Africa and we will announce the preferred bidder very soon.

With regard to the beneficiation strategy that  Mr  Moosa  raised,  I  would
urge all provinces to look at this very closely and I  will  touch  on  some
other points that people have made. We  really  need  to  get  in  and  look
carefully at what can be done. In the  Northern  Cape,  as  I  mentioned,  I
think some exciting new developments will take place  as  a  result  of  the
unbungling and streamlining of the iron  ore  and  other  mineral  deposits.
From there, too, we can begin beneficiating far more of  the  products  that
are developed. As we have seen in the exhibit, in the Free  State  jewellery
is now made by the design school in Virginia. I think this shows that if  we
can  encourage  in  each   of   the   provinces   design   and   small-scale
manufacturing, using the manufacturing advice centres, then instead of  just
exporting the  raw  product,  one  can  export  some  very  exciting  modern
products indeed. I think this is crucial.

I just want to make an additional point here about the Free  State.  One  of
the interesting things is that recently, in the  last  two  years,  we  have
done a lot of work to encourage pharmaceutical trials.  We  have  done  this
because it also  brings  technology  and  will  allow  us  to  develop  more
advanced technology as a platform for  our  own  production  processes.  Hon
members will be pleased to know that the  Free  State  is  one  of  the  key
areas, both for its science base and for its access to facilities.  I  think
this is another example of how the Free State will  begin  changing  towards
advanced manufacturing.

Hon members did not make mention of the highly successful exports  that  are
now coming out of the Eastern Free State. What I think is good, and  what  I
would encourage other provinces to think about, is a  reward  for  exporters
in the province. I think all provinces should give some serious  thought  to
that. I think the national export awards are doing  very  well  indeed,  but
let us at provincial level also encourage our exporters, and maybe even  our
technology people, to feel that they have made a great contribution.

I was asked about the taxi recapitalisation. This is proving to  be  a  very
difficult project indeed. I think it is clear that we need  a  vehicle  that
replaces the current; even the new Toyota vehicle ultimately  needs  certain
changes to it. It is an improvement, but needs changes.  Our  difficulty  is
reaching proper agreement with the industry. The  critical  aspect  of  this
industry is that the fleet must be properly maintained for  the  volumes  of
passengers  carried,  for  the  routes  and  for  the  speed  at  which  our
infrastructure allows people  to  travel.  Fundamentally  important  to  the
whole success of this project is correct and affordable maintenance  of  the
fleet. Otherwise it becomes unsafe and very difficult to  recapitalise.  So,
we are trying to liaise further with the departments. It  is  a  project  we
must proceed with, but I must be honest with the House, it is  giving  us  a
lot of difficulties.

The hon member Nkonyeni spoke of gender and I am glad she did. I think  this
is crucial. We have done a number of things in the DTI  which  I  think  are
very  good  advances.  Certainly,  we  are   beginning   to   change   quite
significantly in the gender composition of our management and of our  staff.
We have introduced three projects, two that are moving  and  one  that  will
come in soon, which are very specifically related to gender and that is  the
Technology for Women in Business programme. It is an exciting project and  I
think it has done very well. As  I  indicated,  we  will  launch  the  South
African Women Entrepreneurs Network next weekend. That network is  really  a
challenge to women. We are asking women to network, to use whatever  we  can
help them with in the DTI but to use each other to advance. I  think  it  is
an exciting idea and I am confident that it will be a success. But  we  will
urge hon member Nkonyeni to become  one  of  the  members  of  that  network
because with her passion I think she will help a lot.

I listened carefully to some of the things  hon  member  Nkonyeni  mentioned
around gambling and other issues and I would just like to  inform  her  that
MEC Mabuyakhulu and myself  and  members  of  my  department  met  with  his
majesty King Zwelithini because we think he can play a role in many  of  the
cultural and agricultural dimensions. It was  a  very  constructive  meeting
indeed.

As always, MEC  Mabena's  knowledge  of  his  economy  and  region  is  very
important and very insightful for all of us. Regarding  access  to  finance,
the main thing we will be doing is not to create some new  miracle  drug  or
miracle mechanism of giving it, but we have realised that  we  need  to  co-
ordinate the DTI's  financial  activities  more  effectively,  and  that  is
really what we are working towards, so we can leverage different aspects  of
our financial support. We think  that  that  will  also  be  a  little  more
successful than we have been able to be up to now.

But I think we often lose sight of just how much has been achieved, both  by
the manufacturing development programme and the Kuhla  guarantee  scheme.  I
think we were expecting that there would  be  rapid  changes  in  small  and
medium enterprises overnight.  It  will  not  happen.  I  really  think  our
successes have been quite considerable, but there is more we need to do.

The micro financing initiative is the third project in  relation  to  women.
Micro financing is one of our three major  initiatives  in  the  department,
which we hope to get launched later this year.

Hon member Durr raised gambling. I respect that  his  party  is  opposed  to
gambling. Our Government, as hon members know, has taken a  clear  strategic
position that this industry will exist, but that it is going to  be  tightly
regulated. We have been discussing with the provinces how we can improve  on
this, in harmonisation with them, and  I  think  we  are  getting  close  to
certain important amendments to the Act, not to its basic structure, but  to
its  operational  dimensions,  to  give   us   greater   co-ordination   and
harmonisation between national and provincial governments. The  question  of
whether in fact the regulatory structure is too expensive is  one  that,  as
MEC Rasool indicated, is worthy of analysis.  I  think  that  the  provinces
must look at it.

At the national level I am confident that we are  getting  value  for  money
through the National Gambling Board. We have members of the board here.  But
I am very confident that we are getting value for money there. I think  they
do a great job. But each province must look at what  it  is  that  they  are
doing and must ensure that their regulatory structure is  giving  value  for
money.  That  is  not  a  national  responsibility;  it  is   a   provincial
responsibility.

Finally, in relation to MEC Rasool's points, I think that he has  made  some
very interesting points. Let me just refer to a  recent  analysis  my  chief
economist's office has been doing on this. It is quite an interesting  point
in some ways. In 1993 the total employment in textile, clothing and  leather
goods in South Africa was 225 772 people. That is  a  significant  industry.
In 2001 the total employment in this industry was 206 920. That  is  a  drop
of just under 20 000. Now, I put it to hon members, that when  one  compares
that to what is happening in other economies in Europe and  elsewhere,  this
industry has not collapsed at  all.  That  is  what  is  crucial.  In  fact,
despite the job  losses,  I  am  quite  convinced  that  this  is  a  growth
industry.

When one takes into account that Lesotho, in  18  months,  employed  15  000
people in new investments, then we can turn  this  industry  around.  It  is
really up to each of the provinces that have the capacity to begin  to  turn
it around. I am sure members  have  recently  seen  the  mohair  advertising
campaign on TV and in the press. Now, that comes from  a  cluster  study  we
had done, similar to the one that  MEC  Mabena  was  talking  about.  It  is
really up to the provinces to get out there and move, and I once again  draw
to hon members' attention an immensely exciting project that they saw  there
from the North West. That is wonderful quality stuff. That is South  African
indigenous soap. There are many other things. We  are  beginning  to  revive
the flax industry in South Africa. We are starting with projects. It  is  up
to us to get out and move.

This is really my appeal to hon members of this House, that they have to  be
ambassadors in their provinces and towns.  There  is  absolutely  no  excuse
with regard to information, be it from the Brain network,  be  it  from  the
call centre we have given them. If we negotiate  more  space  on  the  sixth
floor, which we are trying to do, later this year we will  put  in  a  fully
equipped knowledge centre where one can go and look at this.

But really, hon members have to get out. The  economy  of  their  towns  and
provinces is in their hands, not in the national  hands.  They  can  do  it;
they can help people. I think it would be  inexcusable  for  any  member  of
Parliament or of the provincial legislature,  or  even  for  that  matter  a
local government councillor, not to  have  all  this  information  at  their
fingertips. They have to have it. There is no reason why  they  cannot  have
it. It is there for them to get because every one  of  the  hon  members  in
this House can certainly get access to a computer. That they can do!

I would really appeal to hon members: we must get out there and  do  things.
We will produce - I am not sure the director-general and his team know  this
- this report annually, with the debate that we have in the  NCOP,  so  that
we can start measuring. For the National Assembly  debate  we  produced  the
report on the real economy, and I think it was  a  very  useful  report.  It
contained information that had not been put together before. We will do  the
same for the provinces, working with them, to give a picture  of  how  their
provincial economies are changing.

I think members know from many years' experience now that I am an  optimist,
but I am an optimist who works very, very hard  to  make  sure  my  optimism
comes to fruition. One thing I am very confident about, is that  we  are  no
longer just sailing on the optimism of  the  intellect  driving  this  thing
forward. This economy is starting to break through its structural  problems.
No longer is it possible for leaders,  be  they  political  or  economic  or
union leaders, to say the economy cannot change. It has  changed!  Now,  hon
members' responsibility is to get out there  and  lead  the  change.  We  no
longer have excuses. This economy and the provinces  in  this  country  have
immense potential. Hon members must lead that potential. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

         (h)     a multi-party delegation from  the  relevant  Parliamentary
              Committees.
     The New National Party supported the  Bill,  with  strong  reservations
     about the lack of enforcement power of the Commission, and it regretted
     the fact that the Committee took a final decision on political  grounds
     and not on objective grounds, so as to strengthen the Bill and to  give
     effect to the  spirit  of  the  South  African  Constitution.  The  New
     National Party further regrets that a request to  accept  the  proposed
     amendments and thus cause the Bill to be referred back to the  National
     Assembly for reconsideration, was refused.


     The Democratic Party supported the Bill, with  reservations  on  Clause
     12(3).
