                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  the reported incidents of bombings in Soweto on Tuesday night of
           26 October 2002, leading to the death of one person; and


       (b)  that these bombs were planted in  various  places,  including  a
           mosque, and went off almost at the same time;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the precision of this operation suggests that the  lunatics  who
           carried out this mission have a military background; and


       (b)  this operation is meant to create fear  and  insecurity  amongst
           our people, but will never succeed;


  (3) expresses its utter disgust and strong condemnation of those involved
       in this cowardly act; and
  (4) calls on the security forces and the people of South Africa  to  work
       tirelessly to ensure that these criminals are put behind bars.

[Applause.]

Mr A J BOTHA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -

       on Foreign Affairs is inadequately informed regarding the  crisis  in
       Zimbabwe; and

       (a)  send an urgent fact-finding mission to Zimbabwe to investigate
           the situation there;

[Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the Democratic Republic of Congo peace talks reached a
           breakthrough when major parties and the government agreed on the
           establishment of an interim government where all parties will be
           represented; and


       (b)  President Thabo Mbeki presided over these historic talks which

       African continent as a whole;


  (3) commends all political leaders in the Democratic Republic of Congo
       for working towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict in their
       country; and

Mnr J SCHIPPERS: Mnr Voorsitter, hiermee stel ek namens die Nuwe NP voor:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met skok kennis neem van die bomontploffings in Soweto en dit sterk
       veroordeel;


  (2) dit beklemtoon dat Suid-Afrika 'n grondwetlike demokratiese bestel
       het en sulke sinnelose terreurdade daarom nie geregverdig kan word
       nie;


  (3) die Regering se vinnige optrede verwelkom, asook die ministeriële
       afvaardiging wat reeds die gebied besoek het, want dit stuur 'n
       duidelike boodskap uit dat terrorisme in Suid-Afrika nie geduld sal
       word nie; en


  (4) glo dat die hoë prioriteit wat aan die saak verleen word tot gevolg
       sal hê dat die SAPD in samewerking met die publiek en ander
       rolspelers die skuldiges spoedig aan die pen sal laat ry.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J SCHIPPERS: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with horror the bomb blasts in Soweto and strongly condemns
       them;


  (2) emphasises the fact that South Africa has a constitutional democratic
       order and that such senseless acts of terror can therefore not be
       justified;


  (3) welcomes the Government's rapid response, as well as the ministerial
       delegation that has already visited the area, because this sends out
       a clear message that terrorism in South Africa will not be tolerated;
       and


  (4) believes that the high priority given to the case will result in the
       speedy apprehension of the guilty parties by the SAPF, in conjunction
       with the public and other role-players.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that despite certain strong points, the Medium-Term Budget
       Policy Statement released by Minister Manuel yesterday portrays the
       continued weakness of the Government on the following two fundamental
       realities of contemporary South Africa -


       (a)  firstly, it acknowledges that the Government continues to avoid
           the implementation of a food-stamp system that, unlike current
           measures, will be able to target specific vulnerable groups; and


       (b)  secondly, it recognises that the Government must do more with
           regard to infrastructural development programmes that can create
           jobs on a large scale, since infrastructure is the backbone of
           all social and economic development;


  (2) condemns the Government's continued resistance to proper
       infrastructural development, as illustrated by the R24 billion
       backlog in maintenance on national and provincial roads; and


  (3) calls upon the Government to recognise the fallacy of current
       policies and to adopt innovative new measures to successfully address
       the challenge of poverty, hunger and unemployment.

Ms E GANDHI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern the spate of gruesome crime incidents in Durban in
           the past few months causing consternation in the community; and


       (b)  the execution-style shooting of three young girls and the
           stabbing to death of a child in Reservoir Hills, Durban;


  (2) commends the police for -


       (a)  arresting within 24 hours the three men accused of murdering the
           three young girls; and


       (b)  arresting a young boy of 16 accused of murdering the child in
           Reservoir Hills; and


  (3) urges the SAPS to continue the sterling work they are doing to make
       our country a safe place.

[Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that -


       (a)  the Road Accident Fund's end-of-year deficit on 31 March 2002
           has increased to R16,6 billion;


       (b)  the deficit has doubled since 1997 due to endemic fraud and
           corruption; and
       (c)  the Road Accident Fund is technically insolvent;


  (2) believes that the Satchwell Commission of Inquiry will expose the
       extent of the corruption and fraud when it reports on its findings
       next month; and


  (3) cautions the Government not to increase the petrol levy as  a  short-
       term measure to save a sinking ship,  but  rather  to  wait  for  the
       findings and recommendations of  the  Satchwell  Commission  and  act
       accordingly.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on the
next sitting day of the House on behalf of the MF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Indian community all over South Africa and the world
       will be celebrating Deepavali on Monday, 4 November 2002;
  (2) wishes all those celebrating this auspicious occasion a very happy
       Deepavali; and


  (3) further wishes that -


       (a)  all troubles be forgotten and that the essence of Deepavali
           instill happiness, love, prosperity, success and togetherness in
           our lives in the forthcoming year; and


       (b)  each lamp lit will be a symbol of such happiness and bring
           brightness to the homes and lives of all people, including those
           who will not be celebrating Deepavali.

[Applause.]

Ms B P SONJICA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  that a long-time supporter and member of the ANC, Nomakula
           ``Mampinga'' Elizabeth Goniwe, passed on at the age of 115 on 25
           October 2002 in Cradock;


       (b)  that Nomakula Goniwe lost two sons, Comrade Jacques ``Jamani''
           Goniwe, a gallant fighter who fell in the Wankiel Sipolilo
           Campaign in 1969, and Comrade Matthew ``Matewu'' Goniwe, who was
           brutally murdered by security forces at the height of the
           people's struggle to end apartheid rule;


       (c)  that despite these painful experiences, Mampinga remained a
           steadfast and an unwavering member of the ANC throughout her
           life; and


       (d)  that the ANC salutes this patriot and member of the African
           National Congress; and
  (2) expresses its sincerest condolences to the Goniwe family.


  Lala ngoxolo MaMpinga. Uyabulela uMzantsi Afrika! [Rest in peace,
  MaMpinga. South Africa is grateful to you!]

[Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with appreciation the outcome of the elections for the SRC at
       the Vaal Technikon where the DA succeeded in winning 14 out of the 16
       positions, defeating Sasco and the ANC in the process;


  (2) congratulates the students of the Vaal Technikon on their good
       judgment;


  (3) notes that the IEC, which conducted the election on behalf of the
       technikon, certified that the election was free and fair, but that,
       despite this, the losers are unwilling to accept defeat; and


  (4) calls on the ANC to insist that their youth wing obeys the letter and
       the spirit of South Africa's democratic order and abides by the will
       of the voters.

[Applause.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a partial solar eclipse will occur over South Africa on 4
       December 2002;


  (2) further notes that a total solar eclipse will occur over the north-
       eastern parts of Limpopo province on the same day;


  (3) congratulates the Minister and Department of Arts, Culture, Science
       and Technology on launching an awareness campaign that will provide
       the public with essential safety precautions that must be followed to
       avoid damage to the eyes from viewing the eclipse; and


  (4) urges all South Africans to follow the strictest safety measures when
       viewing the eclipse on 4 December.

Mr S B NTULI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality relocated 650 families
           from Marabastad; and


       (b)  Tshwane Metro moved these families to Mamelodi Extension 6,
           where basic social amenities such as residential stands, water,
           refuse removal and collection, as well as transport are
           provided;


  (2) believes that this demonstrates the ANC's commitment to building a
       better life for all our people through the provision of basic
       services; and


  (3) expresses its appreciation for the initiatives that the Tshwane
       Metropolitan Municipality is embarking on to improve the quality of
       life of our people.

[Applause.]

Mnr J J NIEMANN: Geagte Voorsitter, hiermee stel ek  voor  namens  die  Nuwe
NP:
  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  daar geen bykomende bedrag vir die ontwikkeling en
           instandhouding van Suid-Afrika se paaie in die aanvullende
           begroting beskikbaar gestel is nie;


       (b)  paaie in Suid-Afrika wat in 'n swak toestand is van 5% in 1990
           tot 33% in 2001 gestyg het;


       (c)  die agterstand ten opsigte van die instandhouding van nasionale
           en provinsiale paaie bykans R30 miljard beloop; en


       (d)  dit duidelik is dat huidige fondse nie voldoende is om Suid-
           Afrika se pad- en spoornetwerk in stand te hou en op te gradeer
           nie; en


  (2) glo dat -
       (a)  die herskedulering van die begroting nou noodsaaklik is as ons
           'n goeie vervoer-infrastruktuur in Suid-Afrika wil skep; en


       (b)  indien die agteruitgang van ons vervoer-infrastruktuur nie nou
           aandag kry nie, Suid-Afrika se ekonomie groot skade sal ly.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J J NIEMANN: Hon Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  no additional amount for the development and maintenance of
           South Africa's roads has been made available in the
           supplementary budget;


       (b)  the number of roads in South Africa which are in poor  condition
           has risen from 5% in 1990 to 33% in 2001;


       (c)  the backlog in respect of the maintenance of national and
           provincial roads has amounted to approximately R30 billion; and


       (d)  it is clear that the present funds are not sufficient for the
           maintenance and upgrading of South Africa's road and rail
           network; and


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the rescheduling of the budget is now necessary if we want to
           create a good transport infrastructure in South Africa; and


       (b)  if the deterioration of our transport infrastructure is not
           attended to now, South Africa's economy will suffer greatly.]

                       TERROR ATTACK IN MOSCOW THEATRE

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  115 people lost their lives in a Moscow theatre when Russian
           security forces stormed the theatre to free hostages held by
           armed Chechen separatist rebels; and


       (b)  the government of Russia declared Tuesday, 29 October 2002, a
           national day of mourning;


  (2) believes that armed actions against unarmed and innocent civilians
       constitute acts of terror that militate against the realisation of
       the noble objective of securing for everyone the right to life as
       enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;


  (3) condemns this act of terror;


  (4) joins the people of Russia in mourning and wishes the injured a
       speedy recovery; and

       resolution of political problems.

  (1) unreservedly condemns the bombing outrage in Soweto;
  (2) expresses condolences to the families of the victims; and


  (3) reaffirms -


       (a)  the commitment of the House to the values and freedoms contained
           in the Constitution; and


       (b)  that South Africa is a democracy and that terrorist activity of
           any sort cannot be condoned, but must be condemned in the
           strongest terms.

[Applause.]

Agreed to.

The House adjourned at 17:56.

     explanation for the late tabling of the annual report, financial
     statements and audit report of the South African Management Development
     Institute for the financial year 2001-02:

         2001-2002 to the Auditor-General and the National Treasury in mid

         statements and also required further information, returns,
