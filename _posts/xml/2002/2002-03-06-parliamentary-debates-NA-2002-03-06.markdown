                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr G SOLOMON: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Deputy Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development,
           Cheryl Gillwald, visited and swapped roles in the maintenance
           court in Philippi yesterday, 5 March 2002; and


       (b)  this formed part of the Letsema focus month on human rights;


  (2) believes that the visit by the Deputy Minister to this  court  served
       to highlight the plight of the single parent who  has  difficulty  in
       accessing money for maintenance and the burden that officials have at
       the pay points; and


  (3) commends the Minister for visiting  this  court  to  have  first-hand
       experience of the difficulties encountered by people on the ground.
[Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I give notice of the following motion:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the appointment of Mr Vincent Smith as Acting Chairperson of
           Scopa;


       (b)  that this constitutes a breach of the international principle of
           an opposition chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public
           Accounts;


       (c)  that all opposition parties on Scopa voted against Mr Smith and
           that he therefore only enjoys the support of the majority party
           on Scopa; and


       (d)  the rejection of an opposition candidate nominated as
           chairperson;
  (2) calls on Mr Smith and the ANC to strictly adhere to the time limit
       that has been placed on Mr Smith's appointment by a decision of the
       committee; and


  (3) further calls on the ANC to institute an opposition chairperson on
       the first meeting of Scopa in the next term as agreed.

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) is shocked to learn that 14-year-old Nasiphi Sokwaliwa, a schoolgirl
       from Khayelitsha, lost both feet when she fell under the train on
       Friday when her schoolmate tried to pull her into the open door of a
       crowded carriage;


  (2) sends its deepest condolences to the bereaved family and wishes them
       speedy emotional reprieve; and


  (3) appeals to Metrorail to increase its third-class carriage system
       since a large number of poor households use this system, and that
       such increase should be effected at peak hours to avoid further such
       injuries.

Mr J H NASH: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 480 people were left homeless as a destructive fire
       ravaged the informal settlement of Joe Slovo in Langa, Cape Town,
       over the past weekend;


  (2) calls on the community of Cape Town to volunteer and render whatever
       assistance necessary to assist those who were affected to ease the
       burden caused by this fire; and


  (3) further calls on the municipal authorities to develop mechanisms to
       avoid more fires in these informal settlements.

[Applause.]

Mnr A H NEL: Mev die Speaker, ek gee kennis dat ek op die volgende
sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met waardering kennis neem van die aankondiging van President George
       W Bush dat sekere lande, waaronder Suid-Afrika, uitgesluit gaan word
       van invoertariewe op die meeste staalprodukte;


  (2) besluit dat 'n beroep gedoen word op die Europese Unie om hierdie
       goeie voorbeeld te volg en veral invoertariewe op landbouprodukte so
       laag as moontlik te hou of selfs af te skaf; en


     3) verder die ontwikkelde lande daarop wys dat sulke stappe wêreldwye
        armoede op 'n ekonomies gefundeerde wyse sal aanpak.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A H NEL: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move:
  That the House -


  (1) notes with appreciation the announcement by President George W Bush
       that certain countries, among which South Africa, are going to be
       excluded from import tariffs on most steel products;


  (2) has resolved that an appeal must be made to the European Union to
       follow this good example and to keep import tariffs on agricultural
       products in particular as low as possible or even to abolish them;
       and


  (3) further points out to the developed countries that such steps will
       address worldwide poverty in an economically based way.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the UDM at the next
sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes former President Nelson Mandela's continued visionary
       leadership on the topic of HIV/Aids, especially in the absence of
       leadership from the Cabinet with regard  to the HIV/Aids pandemic;


  (2) notes the mounting criticism by the influential Newsweek, Washington
       Post and New York Times against President Mbeki's dangerous and
       unjustified stance on HIV/Aids; and


  (3) calls on the ANC and the Government to make use of the opportunity
       created by former President Mandela to retreat from their disastrous
       policy on HIV/Aids, and unite with all South Africans in their fight
       against this pandemic.

Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the school boycotts engineered by the Pan Africanist Students'
       Organisation and the PAC in Mpumalanga in the Balfour District and
       Tsakane on the East Rand;


  (2) believes that Paso and the PAC are using the issue of school fees to
       gain political mileage at the expense of learners;


  (3) recognises that the violent and confrontational tactics used by Paso
       will not further their cause, but will disadvantage learners whose
       schooling is interrupted;


  (4) reminds Paso and the PAC that the setting of school fees is the
       responsibility of parents and school governing bodies; and


  (5) condemns Paso and the PAC for this attempt at causing disruption and
       destruction, rather than engaging constructively to address the needs
       of the nation's learners.

[Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ACDP at the next
sitting of the House:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with extreme concern that -


       (a)  the panel headed by Judge Dennis Davis to investigate the
           lifeboat given to Bankorp by the Reserve Bank in 1985, has
           discovered that the Reserve Bank acted outside its authority in
           extending more than R1,25 billion to Bankorp between 1985 and
           1995;


       (b)  through a simulated transaction, a grant from the Reserve Bank
           was disguised as a loan and yielded interest income of R225
           million a year for Bankorp shareholders over a five-year period,
           which benefited certain directors of Bankorp who were closely
           connected to cabinet members of the government of that time;


       (c)  the panel headed by Judge Dennis Davis could find no authority
           to justify the gift of money to Bankorp's shareholders; and


       (d)  the policy holders and certain directors of Sanlam benefited to
           the tune of R1,9 billion and were unfairly enriched from the
           lifeboat package when Bankorp was sold to ABSA in 1992;


  (2) calls on the Governor of the Reserve Bank ... [Time expired.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the South African group of artists Umoja had a successful
       run in London until they were ordered to cancel their show, and as a
       result they had to leave the country unceremoniously as they were
       alleged to be making a noise because of the way they played their
       drums when they danced;


  (2) notes that the situation was not only embarrassing but also
       humiliating for the group of members and the country, owing to the
       lack of appreciation of cultural and indigenous music by the British;
       and


  (3) is of the view that this situation has to be discussed to ensure that
       in future when South African cultural groups intend travelling and
       performing abroad, they are informed and protected from such
       incidences by the Government.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mev M S MAINE: Mev die Speaker, ek gee kennis dat ek sal voorstel:

           Niewoudt van die Silwerjare-outehuis in Schweizer-Reneke vermoor
           is;


       (b)  dat op 4 Maart 2002 die gemeenskap van Schweizer-Reneke,
           verteenwoordigend van alle rasse, in 'n optog teen geweld hande
           gevat en na die hof opgeruk het, waar een beskuldigde verhoor
           is, en dat die gemeenskap geëis het dat die moordenaars swaar
           gestraf moet word; en


       (c)  dat drastiese pogings aangewend moet word om die polisie met
           alle middels ter beskikking by te staan om die skuldiges vinnig
           te arresteer;


  (2) 'n beroep doen op alle gemeenskappe om vrywillig hul dienste
       beskikbaar te stel en die voorbeeld van Schweizer-Reneke te volg, om
       saam te staan in tye soos hierdie, ongeag watter ras of kultuur die
       slagoffer is; en


  (3) kennis neem dat die ANC hiermee sy diepste medelye met die familie
       wil betoon.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

Mrs M S MAINE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the barbaric manner in which the seventy-year-old Mrs Annikie
           Niewoudt of the Silwerjare old age home in Schweizer-Reneke was
           murdered;


       (b)  that on 4 March 2002, in a demonstration against violence, the
           community of Schweizer-Reneke, representative of all races,
           joined hands and marched to court where one accused was tried
           and that the community demanded that the murderers be severely
           punished; and


       (c)  that drastic attempts must be made to assist the police with all
           means at our disposal to arrest the guilty swiftly;


  (2) appeals to all communities voluntarily to offer their services and to
       follow the example of Schweizer-Reneke to stand together in times
       like these, irrespective of the race or culture of the victim; and


  (3) notes that the ANC would hereby like to express its deepest sympathy
       with the family.]

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I intend moving
the following motion:


  That this House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the remarkable turnaround under DA administration in the City of
           Cape Town with regard to street crime and cleanliness;


       (b)  a survey done recently shows that the majority of people now
           feel safe in the city centre and find the cleanliness of the
           city to be acceptable; and


       (c)  crime has plummeted and that this contrasts with a similar
           survey two years ago in Cape Town which showed that the majority
           of people felt that there was a spiral of crime and grime; and


  (2) congratulates the DA, the alternative government, which has proved
       that since winning the municipal elections in Cape Town in December
       2000, it is capable of making a vast difference whereas ANC-
       controlled cities around the country are deteriorating and definitely
       not improving.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that South Africa has 11 official languages;


       (b)  an expectation that individuals in our country will have an
           opportunity to express themselves in the language of their
           choice at most times and every day;


       (c)  that this necessity is most compelling in situations that are so
           grave as to mean life and death; and


       (d)  up to now this was only an ideal;


  (2) welcomes enthusiastically the announcement by the Department of Arts,
       Culture, Science and Technology to initiate the trial Telephone
       Interpreting Service for South Africa project, called TISSA;


  (3) is gratified that two individuals at different ends will now be able
       to talk to each other via an interpreter from a call centre in
       Bloemfontein; and


  (4) heartily welcomes the initiation of this project and trusts that this
       will open the way for a genuine multilingual environment to be
       created in South Africa.

We welcome TISSA. [Applause.]

Mr M E GEORGE: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the North West police have arrested 1 097 people, and
       seized 10 vehicles valued at R303 000 and goods worth R75 775 during
       Operation Tsipa in the North West province last month;


  (2) commends members of the South African Police for recovering these
       goods and bringing criminals to book; and


  (3) calls on communities to continue to work with police to fight crime
       in the province.

[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the South African economy needs skilled, hard-working
       immigrants;


  (2) calls upon all respective role-players to allow South African
       companies to recruit skilled, dedicated immigrants to train South
       Africans and to share their knowledge with their South African
       counterparts;
  (3) further notes that immigration of skilled workers is essential to
       create sustained long-term economic growth; and


  (4) calls on Minister Buthelezi and the Department of Home Affairs to
       design a policy that will protect South African jobs and facilitate a
       process that will attract scarce foreign expertise and investors to
       South Africa.

                         HEALTH SYSTEMS TRUST REPORT

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker and hon members, before commenting on
the interim report of the Health Systems Trust, I would like to take a
minute to explain how this report of the HST came about.

Towards the end of the year 2000, when my colleagues in the provinces and I
decided to establish the operational research sites on preventing mother-to-
child transmission of HIV, we also decided to commission an independent
organisation to record and analyse the progress at these sites. Hence, the
Health Systems Trust was asked to undertake this task.

Even though the provincial departments and national Department of Health
would be collecting information from the sites and would be evaluating
progress, we felt that we needed to have a more objective appraisal of the
programme. The interim report of the HST on MTCT, therefore, comes as no
surprise, as it poses the operational questions that we all agreed were
important and seeks to provide some answers on the basis of the first six
months of experience at these sites.

I am pleased that we have this report to assist us in future decisions and
policy formulation on this programme. I think that I should highlight, as
the Health Systems Trust itself does, what the interim report does and what
it cannot do. The presence of the word ``interim'' in the title of the
report is a clue to its limitations and also indicates that there will be
further reports at a later stage.

The report does not deal with the impact of the use of nevirapine in
reducing HIV rates among babies at the research sites. This is because the
programme is simply too new to yield this information. Every baby given
nevirapine will be tested at one year to determine his or her HIV status.
Because the first sites only began in May, we will only begin to see the
outcome in terms of HIV prevention in the second half of the year 2002, and
it is only then that the issue of universal access will be considered.

However, the report does examine the operation of the existing sites in
some detail. It looks at the number of women seen, the uptake rates of HIV
testing, the conditions under which HIV testing and counselling are
offered, the reliability of nevirapine administration, the use of obstetric
protocols for women with HIV, questions relating to the feeding of the
baby, and the follow-up of mother and baby pairs after delivery.

In the light of what is actually happening at research sites, the report
discusses and makes recommendations, firstly, to improve the running of
existing sites, and secondly, to inform decisions on the possible extension
of the mother-to-child programme in a manner that is effective and
sustainable.

Let me then highlight some of the findings of the report. Within the 18
national research sites the MTCT programme is being provided in over 200
health facilities. This is equivalent to approximately 3 090 antenatal
bookings per month. This means that we are already covering between 10% and
15% of the antenatal bookings in the country in less than one year. This
translates to approximately 3 133 pregnant women per month that we are
reaching through this programme. This is indeed the largest MTCT programme
in sub-Saharan Africa.

It is a fact that in the whole world there is not a single country which
provides universal access to MTCT. All countries are doing research of one
kind or another, because these medicines are new and their long-term
effects are unknown. The report comments on four main issues, namely
staffing, management infrastructure, physical infrastructure and service
integration. The report says, and I quote:
  Human resources are the bedrock of a well-functioning health system and
  mother-to-child transmission programme.

Their recommendations are that we should develop minimum staffing norms and
standards; recruit, train and deploy lay counsellors to support the
service; improve supervision and support of the facility level; and address
the deficiencies in the training of health professionals such as doctors
and nurses on how to deal with Aids patients.

The report says, and I quote:


  A functional health system with effective subdistrict health management
  teams, capable of integrating community-based, clinic-based and hospital-
  based services, is critical.

This means that an MTCT programme should not be implemented as a vertical
programme. It must be integrated with all levels of care through the
district health system. We are working hard with the Department of
Provincial and Local Government on the implementation of the district
health system, to ensure that all our health services reach everyone in
every district council, local municipality, municipal ward and village.

The report says, and I quote:


  Inadequate physical space and privacy has hampered the ability to provide
  adequate counselling and HIV testing services, as well as intrapartum
  care, in many facilities.

It says this is a major barrier to coverage, and therefore we need to
expedite the upgrading of the physical infrastructure of the primary health
care facilities and district hospitals across the country.

The report says, and I quote:


  Counselling has been too strongly associated with consent for an HIV test
  and it needs to be incorporated in a broader set of activities that
  include empowering women with knowledge and information about their
  childbirth, HIV, MTCT and infant feeding.

The report says we must consider couple HIV testing and counselling. It
says we must explore the use of rapid saliva HIV tests as an alternative to
rapid blood testing. Of course, we will explore these proposals, but we
will not compromise the standards and quality of HIV diagnostic testing.

The report says we must address the lack of clarity about clinical and
obstetric management of HIV-positive women in labour. It also encourages
the use of patient-held records instead of keeping patient files at health
facilities. This, it argues, should be done to protect patient
confidentiality. As hon members can see, some of these recommendations need
serious planning and cannot be done overnight.

The researchers say that, and I quote:


  Plans for expansion must therefore address the systematic and
  infrastructural constraints in order to avoid a multiplication of poor
  and/or nonsustained service delivery, as well as to reduce health care
  inequity.

And that is exactly what we are striving for, to improve our health care
delivery system and to ensure that every citizen has equitable access to
quality health care in our country.

The HST report cautions that, and I quote:


  The impression created that implementing the mother-to-child transmission
  programme is as easy as dispensing aspirin fails to convey the many
  genuine complexities that are outlined in this report.

It argues that we should use the lessons learnt in implementing an MTCT
programme as an engine and a catalyst for the improvement of the health
care system and primary health care services in general. The HST
specialises in public health and is not qualified to do clinical research.

I now want to raise an important but related matter. The investigation of
questions relating to resistance to nevirapine within the mother-to-child
transmission programme is being carried out as a separate research
programme, with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases providing
the necessary expertise. As the Health Systems Trust report points out,
research in other countries establishes that resistance does occur and that
maybe the levels are higher than initially thought. We hope to provide more
conclusive answers by taking relatively large experimental samples of 300
women.

This research is being co-funded by Boehringer-Ingelheim, which
manufactures nevirapine, and which is required by the Medicines Control
Council to supply information on resistance as a condition of registration
of the drug for mother-to-child transmission.

Clinical research is being done amongst 300 women at a cost of
approximately R4 million, in order to monitor closely issues of resistance
and adverse reactions due to nevirapine. This research has not been done
anywhere before.

I must remind this House that there is still no cure for Aids, and that in
the absence of a cure, our focus remains on prevention strategies, health
promotion and education, the vigorous treatment of opportunistic infections
and the care and support of those who are infected and affected by HIV and
Aids.
We must not forget that the drug nevirapine is not a cure for Aids, and it
should also not be used as a contraceptive. Our responsibility is to
encourage every South African to take appropriate action to prevent the
transmission of HIV. We continue to remind each and every South African to
abstain from sex, and for young people to delay their sexual debut for as
long as possible. Everyone must be faithful to one partner, and those who
cannot do any of the above should use a condom.

If I could, I would make the HST report compulsory reading for every member
of this House. [Interjections.] This is largely because the document
recognises the complexity of the programme and examines this in a helpful
way.

When the health authorities argue that the mother-to-child transmission
programme is much more than providing women with a pill and babies with a
few drops of nevirapine, they are, in the current unfortunate environment,
seen as making excuses to delay the expansion of the programme. When the
HST makes a similar assertion, and substantiates it by describing the
issues involved, we hope it facilitates a fruitful discussion, which
focuses on solutions.

The HST report also reflects on some of the scientific questions in a
manner that makes these understandable, even to those of us who are not
conversant with this field of work. This, in turn, helps us all to engage
in the related policy debates.

Of particular interest is the HST's assertion that the key policy issue
that confronts Government is not the provision of antiretroviral drugs, but
the question of infant feeding. It points out that mixed breast and formula
feeding by HIV-positive mothers will result in some babies being infected
after birth, even if they receive nevirapine at birth. The HST points out
that interfering with established infant feeding practices, and
particularly introducing breastmilk substitutes, may pose a more deadly
risk to many babies.

These children may be prone to malnutrition and some may die from
diarrhoeal diseases. The issue of affordability and the cost implications
of rolling out formula feeding throughout the whole country also need
prompt consideration, and it broadens the debate from an HIV issue to a
general public health issue. The challenge is not only to reduce HIV rates
among the babies but ultimately to reduce the overall infant mortality and
morbidity rates. We must find ways to avoid substituting one set of health
risks - diarrhoeal diseases, malnutrition and infections - for another,
namely HIV/Aids.

As the HST points out, there is no simple formula for this, but close
monitoring of the situation through our sites will at least provide
reliable information on which we can work.

The HST makes a whole series of recommendations for consideration by
provincial and national Government. It is regrettable but perhaps
understandable, in the current context, that only two have been
highlighted. These are the recommendations on expanding the present
research sites in a gradual and phased manner, proceeding at different
speeds in different provinces, and finding an immediate mechanism to
provide nevirapine, along with providing essential support services to
women already known to be HIV-positive who do not attend the research
sites. I know that some members of this House are looking for a simple
``yes'' or ``no'' answer from me and they will, for the present, be
disappointed.

I have tried, at all times, to indicate that decisions on the mother-to-
child transmission programme are co-ordinated through Minmec, and that
holds true for Government's response to the HST recommendations that touch
on fundamental policy directions.

We will continue to present progress reports on our 5-year strategic plan
on HIV/Aids and sexually transmitted infections, including the progress we
are making on the national PMTCT research sites. What I can say is that I
feel assured that we are making good progress and that we have a very solid
piece of research in front of us.

Its recommendations are both well rooted in the reality that the
researchers have witnessed at the South African sites, and informed by
international experience. I can assure the House that aspects of the report
that relate to policy development will be considered with the seriousness
they demand.

There are many recommendations, however, that relate to implementation
rather than top-level decision-making. I know that even as the public
debate continues, various provinces have been acting on these findings and
trying to strengthen the PMTCT programme in places where it is not meeting
targets in terms of the quality of care, based on national norms and
standards.

Particular attention is being given to management and co- ordination
issues, but above all, we must provide avenues for women themselves to
speak up on how they perceive the progress we are making in the
implementation of this PMTCT programme and tell us how it should be shaped
to adequately meet their needs.

In conclusion, I would appeal to members of this House, and the public at
large, to read the full HST report.

One of the unfortunate aspects of the debate on mother-to-child
transmission of HIV has been the tendency to depict research as a stumbling
block to or an enemy of extended access to care. The HST report shows just
how systematic information gathering can become the key to an effective
programme. We do not want a mother-to-child transmission programme that
does not deliver the goods - we want one that works. And different strands
of research, each with different timescales, will continue to underpin our
work, to enable us to review our policy from time to time.
For me, as the Minister of Health, issues of public health policy are of
paramount importance. Let me remind some of the members of this House that
I am indeed a trained medical doctor, and an obstetrician gynaecologist,
and I have specialised in public health. As such, I have to think about
these issues before I can carefully advise my colleagues in Cabinet,
including the President. [Interjections.]

Therefore, we will examine this report carefully and take whatever steps
are appropriate to increase the coverage of HIV- positive women giving
birth to healthy and HIV-negative children. We will develop national norms
and standards to ensure that wherever this programme is provided, there is
adequate health infrastructure, the service is staffed adequately, and that
there are sufficient and sustainable resources.

We are also committed to see to it that for the women of this country,
pregnancy and childbirth are not seen as illness but as part of their
normal lives, and for those women who are HIV-positive, the ANC-led
Government will see to it that they have an opportunity to live productive
and loving lives in the company of their children, husbands, partners and
families. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Madam Speaker, on a
point of order: I just want to draw your attention to the fact that whilst
this very important public statement was being made by the Minister of
Health, she made reference to aspects of the broader policy that is raised
in this report, and she referred in particular to the ABC approach ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Is that a point of order?

The MINISTER: Yes, it is, Madam Speaker, and I want to explain. The
Minister referred to the ``Abstain! Be faithful! Use condoms!'' approach.
The response from her left was such that there was a lot of sniggering and
laughter. I feel that is a matter of concern, and it should be put on
record because it was, and it is, an important issue that is problematic
... [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I think the Minister has made a valid point, and
I think it is a matter of exchange of views and the emphasis on what is
important, but this cannot really be regarded as a point of order.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, the hon the Minister said that it was a
point of order and it was not. So, I assume this will be deducted from the
ANC's time.

An HON MEMBER: She knew it was not a point of order, she just lied.
[Laughter.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker, every week nearly twice as many people die
in South Africa from Aids as those who died in the World Trade Centre in
New York. Yet anyone looking for a sign from the Minister of Health that
she has recognised the extent of this crisis will look in vain. Her
stubborn refusal to extend the nevirapine project, even in the face of the
report to which she refers, and the fact that there is no good reason to
delay a phased expansion of PMTCT, is only the latest setback of her period
in office, which has been a catalogue of tragedies.

Can the hon the Minister even begin to see how the potential of the PMTCT
programme can act as an engine or catalyst for the improvement of the
health system and primary health care system in general? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! May I please appeal to hon members to stop
making those sounds. It is a matter on which the Speaker has repeatedly
made appeals, and I would really appeal to hon members not to do it.
[Interjections.]

Please continue, hon Kalyan.

Mrs S V KALYAN: The Minister's failure to conceptualise the PMTCT programme
in this way constitutes yet another missed opportunity and perhaps even
undermines other essential areas of primary health care.

At every opportunity to do something proactive about the pandemic she has
looked the other way. Several African countries are recognised for their
successful response to HIV/Aids. South Africa, on the other hand, is
infamous for doing as little as possible to save lives, despite having more
money and capacity. It is hoped that the Minister notes the deficits in
respect of the human infrastructure as presented in the report. Instead of
suspending doctors, she should focus on training counsellors and putting a
universal policy in place.

Where does South Africa stand in respect of the drug debate? The Minister
refuses to negotiate for drug discounts and will not declare a health
emergency, which would allow us to bypass patent laws and manufacture our
own generic drugs. Instead, millions of rands of public money was spend on
fighting a court case, to allow South Africa to import cheaper drugs
manufactured elsewhere. But so far not a single drug has entered the
country.

The report says that no significant adverse effects have been recognised in
either mothers or babies taking a single dose of nevirapine as part of the
PMTCT regimen. Our Minister of Health is safe in the knowledge that her
private medical scheme will protect her if she is ever a victim of sexual
assault. What of the rape survivors who look to the state for protection?
Does she care? I think not, because she continues to stall any call for
antiretroviral medication. [Interjections.]

Not only does the Minister want to bury her own head in the sand, she wants
to encourage the rest of the country to join her in this denial, as
evidenced by her attempt to bury a report on mortality statistics released
by the MRC last year. The Minister of Health has no sense of urgency or
conviction around HIV/Aids. She is content to drown herself with research.
In fact, while the 18 test sites referred to in the report were
commissioned in 2000, some sites were still not up and running in 2001.
And, in fact, nationally defined data for such research was only finalised
in December 2001.

The report suggests that the Minister recognise the moral and political
imperative of PMTCT and what it offers South Africa to redress the
unacceptable inequalities in our system. If she fails to recognise this,
then it is indeed time for the Minister of Health to accept that she is not
up to the challenge of providing a better life for all, and in the interest
of good health in South Africa she should step down. [Interjections.] There
is a saying that when one is in a hole, one should stop digging. The
Minister should stop digging and making that hole bigger. [Applause.]

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: As the hon Kalyan took
the podium, Mr Andrew shouted to Minister Fraser-Moleketi that she was
lying. I do not think that was parliamentary.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Andrew, would you please withdraw that.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, may I address you, please?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! You would like to address me on what?

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, on a point of order.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, if you said to the Minister that she
was lying ...

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, I would like to address you. The Minister had
over two minutes to talk on a point of order.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member Andrew, I do not want to argue with
you. I would like you to withdraw the unparliamentary words that you used
in the House.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, which unparliamentary words?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! That another member is lying, because you know
that it is unparliamentary.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, was it not a lie?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Andrew! [Interjections.] Order! Hon Andrew,
I would like you to withdraw your words that the hon member was lying.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, she was deliberately misleading the House and
I withdraw that ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I would like you to withdraw the
words. That is what I am asking you to do, to withdraw that.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, I am saying she is deliberately misleading
the House. I withdraw the word ``lie''. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a different point of order: Just before
this point of order was taken now, there were some more of those odd noises
emanating from that side of the House there. [Interjections.] And that, I
submit, was in deliberate defiance of the Chair. You had ruled not five
minutes earlier that people should not make noises like that and in
deliberate defiance of the Chair it was done again. And we on this side of
the House know what it is aimed at. It is sexist and racist, and we will
not put up with it, and I want to suggest that the Chair should not put up
with it either.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Thank you for the advice, hon member.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I would like to ask you
what action you are planning to take against the hon the Minister for the
Public Service and Administration. Just before the hon Kalyan spoke, she
rose and said that she was rising on a point of order. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Andrew! [Interjections.]

Mr K M ANDREW: May I address you on the point of order? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Andrew, do not tell me the history, because
I was also here. We were all here and we all heard her. I did point out to
her that it was not a point of order. We do that all the time to hon
members who rise up and say that they are rising on a point of order. That
is the end of the matter. [Interjections.] Hon member, I would like you to
take your seat, because I would like to proceed ... [Interjections.]

Mr K M ANDREW: I would like to take a point of order ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Andrew, I am not debating that issue with
you here and now. [Interjections.] [Applause.] Hon Baloyi, please take the
podium.

Dr O S B BALOYI: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, I am certainly
not rising on a point of order. [Interjections.]

Allow me to open my statements with comments that were made by Mr Kofi
Annan, the UN Secretary-General, in November 2001. These are the urgent
needs that have been identified with regard to HIV/Aids: prevention of the
further spread of the virus is important; arrest of mother-to-child
transmission is vital; provision of care and treatment for all infected
persons is a must; advancement of scientific research for a vaccine and a
cure are the things that need to be addressed; and there must be protection
of those whom the disease has rendered most vulnerable. Those were the key
guidelines he outlined that the world needs to begin to address with
urgency.

He further indicated that it was dangerous to assume that approaches that
had worked in the developed countries would also work with success in
developing countries. Developing countries, he said, if properly enabled,
can erect internal barriers to the pandemic. Those were the challenges that
he put on the table.

We need to accept that the current concepts for combating HIV/Aids in South
Africa, which is a developing country, are inadequate. We need, further, to
accept that the attempts made thus far to contain the spread of HIV/Aids
have failed us. The case in point today is mother-to-child transmission.

All segments of South Africa, all segments of our society, are affected by
HIV/Aids. Unlike in developed countries, where groups of highly educated
people have means to procure treatment in the case of mother-to-child
transmission, we here in South Africa are faced with the situation where
the bulk of the people have great difficulty in understanding the disease,
which runs counter to the way they believe traditionally and otherwise.

Further, mothers who are affected cannot acquire treatment even if they
wanted to, because of their state of poverty. They certainly cannot wait
for a rigid approach to meet certain rules that can actually violate
relevant ethical goals and standards. We are faced in our country with a
situation which is urgent. The life span for HIV/Aids-affected individuals
is going to be very short. I cannot even talk about the life span of the
people we are talking about, the children in utero.

We have a window period of only the gestational period. For those who do
not know, it happens to be only nine months, and no more. That is the
window period within which we must make decisions.

Much as I accept and acknowledge that the mother-to-child transmission
issue is not a question of just providing the women with the pill and the
babies with a few drops of nevirapine, the fact is that we need to ask
ourselves a few questions.

I have a feeling that we cannot wait for the reduction of poverty before we
deal with HIV/Aids. Something must be done now. We cannot wait for the
cultural and behavioural changes before we do something decisive.

We cannot wait for improved education before we initiate the things that
will make a difference with HIV/Aids. Indeed, we cannot wait for the
empowerment of women before we can let them have the treatment. The IFP
feels that immediate treatment of pregnant mothers to prevent mother-to-
child transmission must take place. [Applause.]

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order: Before Mr Andrew
turned his back on you and left the House, he had been ordered to withdraw
the word ``lying''. To my mind he never did. [Interjections.] He then added
the words ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Can we have some order, hon members!

Mr A C NEL: He then added the words ``deliberately misleading'', which I
submit are unparliamentary and he should withdraw them.

Furthermore, he showed extreme contempt to both the Chair of this House, as
well as the House as a whole, by the manner in which he stood up, turned
his back on you and left the House. I submit that he should be taken to
task for that.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, on the matter of the words that he
used, thank you for pointing that out. I will examine the Hansard and I
will come with a ruling.

Dr S J GOUS: Mev die Speaker, niemand kan seker die publiek kwalik neem as
hulle hierdie onderwerp heeltemal verwarrend vind nie. Dit is nou maar
eenmaal 'n kenmerk van ons politici dat ons eenvoudige sake heeltemal kan
vertroebel, en ingewikkelde sake heeltemal onverstaanbaar kan maak.

Feit is, ons neem nie die totale prentjie in ag wanneer ons hierdie sake
debatteer nie. Dit is 'n verlammende debat wat besig is om in sirkels te
gaan en ons te frustreer. Hierdie debat vandag gaan oor een ding, en dit is
antiretrovirale middels in die gebruik van moeder-na-kind voorkoming. Dit
is waaroor ons praat, oor niks anders nie. Om die waarheid te sê, dit is 'n
baie klein onderafdeling van die totale prentjie. Dit moet ons net eers
verstaan.

As ons die algehele respons van ons land op Vigs in ag neem - en dit sluit
die gebruik van antiretrovirale middels uit - dan is dit tog waar dat ons
een van die beste response in die wêreld het, en definitief die beste in
Afrika. Maar dit is duidelik dat mense nog nie verstaan waaroor ons presies
baklei nie. Op die oomblik moet ons duidelik probeer onderskei tussen die
gebruik van antiretrovirale middels in die voorkoming en in die behandeling
van die siekte. In die voorkoming van Vigs gebruik ons een middel, een
dosering, en volstaan daarmee. In die behandeling van Vigs gebruik ons 'n
hele aantal middels, hoë doserings, vir 'n lang tyd. Ons moet net verstaan
vandag praat ons oor die behandeling en die voorkomende aspekte van moeder-
tot-kind oordrag.

In hierdie verslag van die Health Systems Trust is daar positiewe en
negatiewe aspekte. Die positiewe aspekte is dat daar bevind is dat daar
geen belemmering is op die sistematiese, volhoubare en gefaseerde uitrol
van moeder-na-kind voorkomingsprogramme nie. Daar is geen probleem met
toksisiteit en newe-effekte nie, en dit is tog feitlik so as 'n mens net
een dosering van 'n middel gee, kan 'n mens verwag dat hierdie aspekte baie
laag gaan wees. Weerstand kom wel voor, maar dit is nie 'n probleem in
hierdie omstandighede nie, want 'n mens gaan dit net een maal gebruik, en
die weerstand verdwyn in elk geval na ses maande. Wanneer 'n mens opvolg-
antiretrovirale behandeling gee, gebruik 'n mens dit in multimiddels, nie
net een nie, en nevirapien word ook baie selde onder hierdie omstandighede
gebruik.

Die negatiewe aspekte van hierdie verslag gaan oor kapasiteit,
infrastruktuur en die verskil tussen provinsies, wat beskryf word as die
verskil tussen twee lande. Die skrywers merk op dat hierdie tekortkomings
nie 'n verskoning behoort te wees nie, en navorsing behoort ook nie 'n
verskoning te wees vir die uitrol nie. Laat ons net 'n paar waarskuwings in
ag neem. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, one can probably not blame the public if they
find this topic completely confusing. It is a characteristic of politicians
that we can completely obscure simple matters and make complicated matters
completely incomprehensible.

The fact is, we do not take the entire picture into account when we debate
these matters. This is a paralysing debate which is going round in circles
and frustrating us. This debate today is about one thing, and that is
antiretroviral measures used in mother-to-child prevention. That is what we
are talking about, nothing else. To tell the truth, it is a very small
subsection of the total picture. We must just first understand that.

If we take into account the overall response of our country to Aids - and
this excludes the use of antiretroviral measures - then it is indeed true
that we have one of the best responses in the world, and definitely the
best in Africa. But it is clear that people still do not understand
precisely what we are arguing about. At the moment we must try to
distinguish clearly between the use of antiretroviral measures in the
prevention and in the treatment of the illness. In the prevention of Aids
we use one measure, one dose, and that is sufficient. In the treatment of
Aids we use quite a number of measures, high dosages, for a long time. We
must just understand that today we are talking about the treatment and the
preventative aspects of mother-to-child transmission.

There are positive and negative aspects in this report by the Health
Systems Trust. The positive aspect is that it has been found that there is
no impediment to the systematic, sustainable and phased roll-out of mother-
to-child preventative programmes. There is no problem with regard to
toxicity and side effects, and it will surely really be the case that when
one only gives one dosage of a remedy, one can expect that these aspects
are going to be very low. Resistance does indeed occur, but it is not a
problem in these circumstances, because one is only going to use it once,
and in any case the resistance disappears after six months. When one gives
follow-up antiretroviral treatment, one uses it in multiple measures, not
only one, and nevirapine is also used very seldom under these
circumstances.

The negative aspects of this report deal with capacity, infrastructure and
the difference between provinces, which is described as the difference
between two countries. The authors note that these shortcomings should not
be an excuse, and research should not be an excuse for the roll-out. Let us
just take a few warnings into consideration.]

Misunderstandings and half-truths are being added to the politicisation of
what should be a public health issue. The process has been hijacked by
political controversies and public anger. Prevention of mother-to-child
transmission must now be driven by premiers and politicians instead of
programme managers at the provincial sites. Let that be a warning to all of
us. [Applause.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, HIV/Aids is a thorny issue that need not be
debated more than this. It has been debated, and people are dying. The
Government should stop delaying HIV/Aids treatment by refusing to accept
scientific findings that nevirapine prevents the chances of mother-to-child
transmission.
The time has come for the Government to listen to experts, make
antiretroviral drugs available to all people living with HIV/Aids and unite
with all South Africans in their fight against this dreadful disease.

The Government is also called upon to withdraw its appeal against the
decision of the Transvaal Provincial Division that nevirapine be made
available to all pregnant women for the prevention of mother-to-child
transmission.

Children are dying in their thousands while politicians are busy debating
this issue. I think it is now time that the ANC Government should
reconsider their policy on this issue of HIV/Aids and see to it that
pregnant women get nevirapine as the necessary medicine to prevent children
from being infected.

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, although the report details difficulties around
expanding services to prevent mother-to- child transmission, it confirms
that there are no good reasons to delay. The report suggests that phased
expansion in provinces due to differences in capacity should combine with
the immediate provision of nevirapine to HIV-positive pregnant women.
The report also notes that no significant side effects have been recognised
in mothers or babies taking single-dose nevirapine, while Government has
been like a stuck record over lack of capacity, over toxins, costs and
breast-feeding, which have all been broadly and soundly refuted. Reports
indicate that HIV transmission through breast-feeding is less than 6%,
which means that out of every 100 babies who are breast-fed, only six would
be in danger of possible infection.

The ACDP is disappointed by Government's stiff-necked attitude over this
issue, but not surprised as the policy is in line with their pro-death
policy for unborn babies, which sets the precedent in this country for
children to be valued less the younger they are.

Now the Minister suggested that every South African should abstain from
sex. Is this a new population control method? Opposition parties thought
this was a mistake and laughed. I, on the other hand, am not so sure since
I note that the ANC policies are very much aimed at population control.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the people of our country, like people who
are drowning, look appealingly to this House for salvation. The PAC has
fought for over three years to get the Government to fight the HIV/Aids
epidemic with every weapon at its disposal. The denial of the seriousness
of the epidemic from the Government has been bordering on the criminal, and
tens of thousands of lives have been lost that could have been saved.

Our warrior doctor, Dr Costa Gazi, has been vilified and threatened for
persistently and courageously calling for sanity to prevail. Like Galileo
of old, he said repeatedly: `` And yet it turns to those who were denying
that the earth revolves around the sun.''

We demand that antiretroviral drugs be manufactured locally under
Government licence as part of a national emergency. Patent rights cannot be
more important than the lives of our people. The destruction caused by
HIV/Aids must be halted and no more time must be spent on petty debates.

We appreciate the explanation given by the Minister, but it only emphasises
that this is a very complex debate which should be left to scientists and
academics and that the pragmatic side of it should really be attended to
speedily. [Time expired.]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, Aids needs no introduction. We all know it
is a killer with no cure, only prevention. This disease has made itself
present globally, and though many carelessly believe that their
irresponsible habits will not get them infected, what guarantee is there
besides luck?

Aids has affected Africa profoundly. It is causing a social and economic
breakdown as it diminishes our workforce. Aids is crippling us by killing
our people.

Our Government has broadened sex education, with the object to curtail the
problem of Aids. Yet, many fail to see the seriousness of the situation. We
are working hard at inspiring prevention from infection. Unless the disease
finds itself checked, we are faced with the predicament of pregnant HIV-
positive mothers passing on the disease to their babies.

We are also faced with the issue of nevirapine. The MF intensely feels that
the child at risk is the priority in this situation, and that we are
responsible for ensuring the safety and wellbeing of these innocent babies.
If the supply of nevirapine is the means to ensuring this, then it should
be provided.

We are here to ensure the proper running and protection of our country and
its people. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, with regard to the hon the Minister's advice of
total abstinence, I will try, but I have got my doubts.

Hierdie debat het 'n hele tyd gelede ontstaan en daar is 'n bepaalde
standpunt ingeneem deur die regering, veral deur President Mbeki, dat
hierdie middele nie verskaf sal word nie. Intussen het baie dinge gebeur.
Nog navorsing is gedoen. Daar was 'n hofuitspraak wat die regering verplig
het om dit te doen. Die premiers van drie provinsies het besluit om hierdie
middele wel te verskaf. Wat het egter gebeur? 'n Dokter wat dit in sy
hospitaal verskaf, word afgedank.

Vandag kry ons hierdie verslag van die HST. Dit is wel in Engels, maar dit
is vir my duidelik dat die verslag ten gunste is van die toediening en
beskikbaarstel van nevirapien om oordrag te voorkom. Ons het 'n duidelike
``ja'' verwag en steeds lyk dit of die Minister terugkrabbel. Gaan dit
werklik om die lewe en dood van hulle vir wie ons verantwoordelik is? Of
word hier 'n spel gespeel om verleentheid te bespaar, aangesien ons te
trots is om ons trots in die sak te steek en te sê: ``Dit was 'n fout. Die
goed moes lankal bekend gestel word.'' Ons vra dat dit onvoorwaardelik
beskikbaar gestel word in alle staatshospitale. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[This debate originated some time ago and a specific standpoint was taken
by the Government, especially by President Mbeki, that these medicines
would not be provided. In the meantime many things have happened. More
research has been done. There has been a court verdict which compelled the
Government to do this. The premiers of three provinces decided that they
would, in fact, provide these medicines. However, what happened? A doctor
who provided it in his hospital was dismissed.

Today we have received this report from the HST. It is, in fact, in
English, but to me it is quite clear that the report is in favour of the
administering and provision of nevirapine to prevent transmission. We
expected an emphatic ``yes'' and yet it would seem as though the Minister
is backtracking. Is this really about the life and death of those for whom
we are responsible? Or is a game being played to save embarrassment since
we are too proud to swallow our pride and say: ``This was a mistake. These
medicines should have been made available a long time ago.'' We ask that
the medicine be made available unconditionally in all state hospitals.]

Mrs M M MALUMISE: Madam Speaker, we congratulate the Minister and MECs for
having the foresight to implement the MTCT programme, initially through a
number of learning sites. The HST report indicates that this was the right
approach to have taken, and that as a result many valuable lessons have
been learned - lessons which can be applied to ensure that all women will
receive the best that the Government can offer to prevent the transmission
of HIV from mother to child. But more importantly, these lessons will
ensure that MTCT services will be implemented in a way that is sustainable,
effective and equitable.

This report raised important concerns about postnatal infant feeding - an
issue that has received little attention or interest from the media, or,
indeed, from any other group or organisation that has been vocal on the
MTCT issue. In this regard, we have to convey to the House that the
Government has been vindicated in its decision to await the findings of the
evaluation, despite coming under heavy pressure to do otherwise.

Regarding this report from the HST, I would like to stress that it was not
only commissioned by Government, but also released publicly by Government
without delay. Government is now in a position to make clear and important
decisions about the future of the programme, based on these
recommendations.

I want to express our thanks to the hundreds of front-line health workers
who have succeeded in making the MTCT programme accessible to over 6 000
women in nine provinces. This has been no mean feat.

It is imperative that we define more clearly the boundary between the
prerogative of elected politicians to define and influence health policy,
and the prerogative of senior health officials who are also charged with
the responsibility of defining policy, as well as implementing it.
It has appeared at times as if the role of public health professionals and
technical experts has been undermined by unhealthy politicking on health -
a phenomenon that only serves to demoralise our community health workers.

I would like to urge the Minister and the MECs to prioritise the following
two recommendations emanating from the report. Firstly, each province
should develop a coherent, credible plan to gradually expand the MTCT
programme in a phased manner, and in a way that addresses the lack of
health care infrastructure.

The HST report states clearly that the huge disparities in health care
between and within provinces cannot be divorced from the issue of expanding
MTCT services, but states that the lack of health care infrastructure
should not be seen as a reason for not expanding the services.

Secondly, a national commission of experts from the three fields of HIV,
nutrition and child health should be convened as a matter of urgency to
discuss issues about infant feeding and postnatal HIV transmission.

Finally, I believe that with a clear recommendation emanating from the HST
evaluation the Government has an opportunity to come together around the
issues related to HIV and Aids. There has been far too much polarisation,
conflict and confrontation at a time when we desperately need to be pulling
together. All of us in this House and all South Africans want the same
thing - a healthy and an equitable society devoid of unnecessary and
avoidable suffering and death. [Applause.]

                            TUESDAY, 5 MARCH 2002

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson:


     (1)    The following Bill was introduced by the Minister of
         Communications in the National Assembly on 5 March 2002 and
         referred to the Joint Tagging Mechanism (JTM) for classification
         in terms of Joint Rule 160:


         (i)     Electronic Communications and Transactions Bill [B 8 -
              2002] (National Assembly - sec 75) [Bill and prior notice of
              its introduction published in Government Gazette No 23195 of 1
              March 2002.]


         The Bill has been referred to the Portfolio Committee on
         Communications of the National Assembly.


         In terms of Joint Rule 154 written views on the classification of
         the Bill may be submitted to the JTM within three parliamentary
         working days.


     (2)    On 5 March 2002 the Joint Tagging Mechanism (JTM), in terms of
         Joint Rule 160, classified the following Bill, which was
         introduced as a section 76 Bill, as a section 75 Bill:


         (i)     Disestablishment of South African Housing Trust Limited
              Bill [B 3 - 2002].


              In terms of Joint Rule 160(4), the JTM finds that the Bill:


              (a) is not a section 76 Bill;


              (b) includes no provision to which the procedure prescribed in
                  section 76 of the Constitution applies;


              (c) is in breach of section 73(3) of the Constitution in that
                  it was incorrectly introduced in the wrong House; and


              (d) is thus constitutionally out of order.


         In terms of Joint Rule 160(6) the Bill is constitutionally out of
         order. According to Joint Rule 162 the Bill may not be proceeded
         with, but may be re-introduced in the correct House.


     (3)    The following Bill was introduced by the Minister of Housing in
         the National Assembly on 5 March 2002:


         (i)     Disestablishment of South African Housing Trust Limited
              Bill [B 3 - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 75) [Explanatory
              summary of Bill and prior notice of its introduction published
              in Government Gazette No 22728 of  5 October 2001].


         The Bill has been referred to the Portfolio Committee on Housing
         of the National Assembly.


              NOTE: On 14 February 2002, at the request of the Minister of
              Housing, this Bill was introduced as a section 76 Bill in the
              National Council of Provinces by the Select Committee on
              Public Services. As the Bill has since been classified by the
              Joint Tagging Mechanism (JTM) as a section 75 Bill (see p in
              the Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports of today, 5
              March 2002), it cannot be proceeded with in the National
              Council of Provinces.


              As the Bill introduced today has not been printed again, the
              information relating to the House of introduction, person in
              charge and classification of the Bill, as reflected on its
              front page, is incorrect. The Bill is in fact a section 75
              Bill introduced in the National Assembly by the Minister of
              Housing.
