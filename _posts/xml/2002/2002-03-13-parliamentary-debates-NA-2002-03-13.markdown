 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND

Report adopted without debate.

The SPEAKER: Order!  Hon  members,  I  wish  to  acknowledge  in  the  House
Minister Pronk from the Netherlands, also the Secretary-General and  Special
Envoy on Sustainable Development, a long-standing friend of  the  democratic
South Africa. [Applause.]

Minister Pronk, it is  very  appropriate  that  you  should  be  here  today
because we are  aware  of  your  efforts  in  bringing  that  protocol  into
existence, and you are now seeing that  this  Parliament  is  endorsing  it.
Thank you very much, and welcome again. [Applause.]

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Minister of Housing has  announced  a  Cabinet  decision  to
           increase the housing subsidy;


       (b)  the amount of R3,7 billion allocated this  financial  year  will
           increase to R4,1 billion in 2003-04;


       (c)  a  National  Saving  Scheme  for  Housing  will  be  introduced,
           enabling  communities  to  actively  participate  in   dedicated
           savings programmes; and


       (d)  the Government is reviewing the hostel system, to move away from
           the so-called redevelopment of  hostels  to  an  approach  where
           rental stock will be created and maintained;


  (2) calls upon communities to participate in the savings programme and in
       building their own homes; and


  (3) congratulates the ANC-led Government on this announcement,  which  is
       in line with its commitment to the creation of a better life for all.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the person and the party demonstrably responsible for  the
       monstrous crisis in Zimbabwe is back in  power  as  a  result  of  an
       election campaign marred by fundamental and serial violations of  the
       rule of law and of human rights over a long period; and


  (2) resolves that South Africa should now display bold leadership and -


       (a)  support the  concept  of  a  government  of  national  unity  in
           Zimbabwe;


       (b)  supply humanitarian aid and especially food to  help  avert  the
           threatening mass starvation;


       (c)  ally ourselves on the side of human rights and the rule of  law;
           and


       (d)  firmly indicate to the Zimbabwean government the consequences of
           any further violations of the rule of law  and  good  governance
           which would be disastrous for Nepad and for  our  ambitions  for
           the rest of the world to take Africa seriously.

[Applause.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I will move  on  the
next sitting day of the House on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the police on having discovered arms and ammunition  at
       a private residence in Pretoria;


  (2) hopes that the investigation will lead to the arrest of the criminals
       involved in bringing arms into this country; and


  (3) urges the police to fast-track the investigation in order  to  expose
       the syndicate behind these criminals.

Mrs M M MALUMISE: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a baby died after a generator ran out  of  diesel  in  the
       Northern Province;


  (2) believes that  this  incident  warrants  serious  attention  as  this
       constitutes a gross violation of human rights;
  (3) calls on the  hospital  authorities  and  the  health  department  to
       investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of this baby; and


  (4) urges them to take appropriate action and preventative measures.

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1)  expresses  its  revulsion  at  the  continued  abuse  of   children,
       especially of babies;


  (2) notes with shock that the sexual abuse of children increased by  400%
       over the past 10 years;


  (3) therefore welcomes the Government's proposed plans to  tighten  child
       pornography laws that will make it easier for the authorities to  act
       against those guilty of such an offence; and


  (4) believes that the outcome of the  parliamentary  task  team's  public
       hearings into child  abuse  must  be  the  speedy  implementation  of
       measures by the Departments of Social Development, of Health and  for
       Justice and Constitutional Development that will  ensure  an  end  to
       this utterly despicable practice.

Mr W G MAKANDA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns in the strongest terms the  Israeli  aggression  and  brutal
       massacre of unarmed Palestinian civilians by 150 Israeli tanks in  an
       unprovoked invasion of Ramallah;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  the world community should acknowledge that this is a  state  of
           war unleashed against innocent civilians by a militarist  regime
           enjoying US patronage, armed by that  country  and  consequently
           disdaining critical international opinion which  has  repeatedly
           expressed  outrage  at  Israeli  aggression  and  occupation  of
           Palestinian territory; and


       (b)  the campaign of disinformation and pretext for these attacks are
           calculated to  nullify  Israeli-Palestinian  agreements  entered
           into by previous regimes on  which  the  present  administration
           reneges; and


  (3) calls on the UN Security Council to take appropriate action  to  halt
       Israeli incursion and massacre of civilians.

[Applause.]

Mr N B FIHLA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move  on  behalf  of
the ANC:
  That the House:


  (1) notes that  the  hon  the  Minister  of  Correctional  Services,  Ben
       Skosana, opened the Pre-release Centre in Devon, Pretoria;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the multidisciplinary health approach  adopted  at  this  centre
           will educate, inform and foster  positive  health  behaviour  of
           inmates; and


       (b)    the   holistic   and   multidisciplinary   approach   to   the
           rehabilitation  and  development  of  inmates  embraced  by  the
           Department of Correctional Services is a clear demonstration  of
           the department's vision and commitment to excellence; and


  (3)  welcomes  the  pre-lease  programmes,   as   they   will   encourage
       rehabilitation and employment opportunities and prevent recidivism in
       our prisons.
Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf  of
the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shame that 1st February 2002 marked the anniversary  of  5
       years of legalised abortion on demand in South Africa and mourns  the
       tragic deaths of over 200Â 000 South African babies, legally  murdered
       since that date;


  (2) salutes the brave doctors and nurses who have refused  to  submit  to
       inhuman  laws,  resolutely  withstanding   Government   pressure   to
       participate in the killing of unborn babies;


  (3) commends those from many different organisations and churches  around
       the country who solemnly observed the five years of the  legalisation
       of abortion on demand between the 1st and 3rd of February;


  (4) notes specifically that -
       (a)  in Cape Town about 80 people held a funeral procession from  the
           Grand Parade to Parliament, mourning the aborted children;


       (b)  at Parliament, little coffins, flowers and crosses were arranged
           outside the main gate and a crowd of about 150 earnestly  prayed
           for forgiveness and for God's power to overcome this evil;


       (c)  in Bloemfontein a group, including pastors, gathered outside the
           Marie Stopes Clinic in Elizabeth Street; and


       (d)  in Upington 102 crosses were planted,  representing  the  babies
           who lost their lives through abortion at the local hospital last
           year; and


  (5) calls on the Government to repeal this atrocious  law  and  stop  the
       wholesale slaughter of unborn children in South Africa.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates ZANU-PF on its hard-won victory;


  (2) calls on ZANU-PF and the MDC to focus sharply on rebuilding  Zimbabwe
       in the interests of the SADC and Africa;


  (3) expresses its gratitude to  our  parliamentary  team  which  went  to
       observe the Zimbabwean elections;


  (4) realises that this was not an easy assignment,  since  the  situation
       was volatile and full  of  dangers,  including  the  observers  being
       misunderstood and accused of  taking  sides  by  all  the  contending
       parties;


  (5) sends its condolences to the government of Zambia, which lost one  of
       its observers in Zimbabwe through sudden sickness; and


  (6) wishes the people of Zimbabwe peace and prosperity and  condemns  all
       forms of interference in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe.

[Applause.]

Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the shocking  reports  of  the  incidence  of  sexual  abuse  of
           children in UN refugee camps in West Africa; and


       (b)  that our country is  taking  rapid  and  drastic  steps  towards
           addressing this affront to democracy and nonsexism;


  (2) commends the timeous and strong reaction of the Secretary-General  of
       the UN, Kofi Annan, in this regard; and


  (3) calls on all African leaders to do everything in their power to avoid
       conflict and to ensure hope for  the  abused  and  emaciated  African
       child so that the 21st century truly will become the African century.

[Applause.]

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its disgust at the underhanded way  in  which  the  New  NP
       colluded with the ANC to remove Dr Audrey van Zyl from the NCOP;


  (2) notes that she was given no significant reasons  for  her  dismissal,
       nor a reasonable chance to defend herself;


  (3) recognises that this is an admission by  Mr  Van  Schalkwyk  of  deep
       divisions in the New NP and lack of support for his leadership;


  (4) advises all New NP members to beware, as their leader wields the  axe
       before laws are passed to allow parliamentarians to cross the  floor;
       and


  (5) questions  whether  bugging  equipment  found  in  the  Western  Cape
       legislature was being used by the New NP to test the loyalty  of  its
       members.

[Interjections.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the investigating officers on their work in  collecting
       the positive evidence that led to the arrest of the man who raped and
       sodomised nine-month-old baby Tshepang in Louisvale,  near  Upington,
       in October last year;


  (2) urges the community of Louisvale to work together  with  the  police,
       and not take the law into their own hands, so as to ensure  that  the
       court case is finalised as soon as possible and justice can  run  its
       course; and


  (3) strongly condemns such behaviour and makes it known that  people  who
       commit such crimes have no place in our society.

Mr Q J KGAUWE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on  behalf  of
the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  thirty Palestinians died as Israeli forces stormed refugee camps
           and occupied Ramallah; and


       (b)   the  United  Nations  Secretary-General,  Mr  Kofi  Annan,  has
           condemned the excessive use of force by Israeli armed forces;


  (2) believes that peaceful  coexistence  and  prosperity  in  the  region
       depend on the commitment of all parties to work  towards  a  peaceful
       solution of the political problems in the Middle East;


  (3) supports the condemnation of  Israeli  security  forces  by  Mr  Kofi
       Annan; and


  (4) calls on all parties to cease fire and to work towards peace  in  the
       region.

[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move  on  behalf  of
the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the  European  Union  and  the  Department  of  Trade  and
       Industry signed an agreement on  Tuesday  under  which  the  EU  will
       donate 5,5 billion euros orÂ±R550 million to initiate a  risk  capital
       fund for small and medium enterprises;


  (2) calls upon all role-players in the  private  and  public  sectors  to
       encourage SMMEs to participate;


  (3) acknowledges that a prerequisite for future sustained economic growth
       is to enable the support sectors outside  traditional  manufacturing,
       such  as  tourism,  techno-industries,  wholesale  venture   capital,
       public/private partnerships, agribusiness and small-scale mining,  to
       develop; and


  (4) believes that the responsible proactive management of risk capital is
       essential to advance black empowerment and job creation.

Mr G SOLOMON: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting  day  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the war against crime is not  the  responsibility  of  the
       state alone: ultimate victory  also  depends  upon  the  support  and
       involvement of the community to  bring  peace  and  security  to  the
       people in its neighbourhood;


  (2)  recognises  the  outstanding  contribution  of  the   business   and
       professional people of Grassy Park in Cape Town, who have established
       the Grassy Park Community Safety Project;


  (3) notes that since October  2001  the  project  has  funded  14  police
       reservists to patrol and protect the area; and


  (4) notes that since the introduction of these patrols  the  police  have
       noted that there has been no major  incidence  of  crime  within  the
       project areas.

[Applause.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move  on  behalf  of
the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the decision of our President, the hon  Thabo  Mbeki,  and  the
       Minister of Correctional Services, the hon Ben  Skosana,  to  appoint
       the  Jali  commission  to  investigate  allegations  of   corruption,
       maladministration, violence and intimidation in  prisons  around  the
       country;


  (2) commends the Minister of Correctional Services for his commitment  to
       principles of good governance, transparency and accountability; and


  (3) calls on all personnel and members of the Department of  Correctional
       Services to co-operate and ensure that the Jali commission is able to
       fulfil its mandate.

[Applause.]

Mr C M LOWE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with shock that the Durban Metro  Police  Dog  Unit's  Constable
           Prem Mothilall was shot twice  in  the  chest  while  trying  to
           apprehend armed suspects and remains in a coma;


       (b)  that this tragedy was avoidable  if  the  ANC-run  Durban  Metro
           Council had accepted a DA request for bulletproof  vests  to  be
           issued to police personnel; and


       (c)  that the dog unit is striking to protest the  council's  refusal
           to provide bulletproof vests;


  (2) extends its sympathies to Constable Mothilall's family and prays  for
       his recovery; and


  (3) calls on the Government to ensure that the metro police  receive  the
       same safety equipment as the SAPS personnel, to enable them to  carry
       out their duties with confidence.
                         ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION BILL

[Applause.]

The Speaker announced that, by agreement, this Order would stand over.

The House adjourned at 17:20.
