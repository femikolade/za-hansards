                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam  Speaker,  Mr  President,  Deputy  President,
Cabinet colleagues, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, our dear friends,  at
home or at work, sharing this afternoon with us,  thank  you  for  the  time
that you are giving us today. For those privileged to be in  the  House  and
chewing, they will know that there is nothing as  sweet  as  South  Africa's
hanepoot grapes. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The philosopher Richard Rorty writes:


  In my utopia, human solidarity  would  not  be  seen  as  a  fact  to  be
  recognised by clearing away ``prejudice'' or burrowing down to previously
  hidden depths but, rather, as a goal to be achieved. Is it to be achieved
  not by inquiry but by imagination, the imaginative ability to see strange
  people as fellow sufferers. Solidarity is not  discovered  by  reflection
  but  created.  It  is  created  by  increasing  our  sensitivity  to  the
  particular details of the pain and humiliation of other, unfamiliar sorts
  of people.

Introduction - creating solidarity

The Budget we present today seeks to embody a philosophy that lies  deep  in
the struggle that has brought us together in this  democratic  assembly.  It
is a philosophy of people affirming the things that they share  with  others
above those that set them apart, relying not on abstract concepts and  ideas
to build our community, but seeking  to  anchor  it  to  daily  solidarities
expressed in deeds and actions, of which this Budget  is  only  one,  but  a
particularly visible, example. This solidarity does not appear out  of  thin
air, but is nurtured and sustained through ``the imaginative ability to  see
strange people as fellow sufferers'', as  Rorty  wrote,  and  this  in  turn
nurtures and sustains us. This solidarity that saw us through the  centuries
of oppression instilled in us that imaginative  capacity  to  identify  with
the suffering in our midst. But that was already part of us when we  stepped
back from the precipice - oppressor and  oppressed  -  and  began  the  long
journey toward a better life for all. This is  the  solidarity  of  which  I
speak. This is our legacy.

We know that the society to which we  aspire  -  compassionate,  democratic,
egalitarian - will not come about by belief alone. It is a society  we  seek
to create. We create it in our communities when a person who has  never  had
running water opens a tap in her own back yard, when a family  turns  on  an
electric light for the very first time. We create it in our region  when  we
join in a contracts with others, seeking to negotiate a new partnership  for
the sustainable development of the continent.

We seek its global embodiment in an international  order  committed  to  the
eradication of poverty, not because poverty  is  the  presumed  seed-bed  of
terrorism, but because we are all enriched  by  affirming  the  dignity  and
recognising the potential of others. [Applause.]

As we table the  2002  Budget  before  this  House  today  it  is  therefore
appropriate that we take some time to reflect on  the  developments  in  the
global economy.  The  past  two  decades  were  characterised  by  unbridled
optimism fuelled by the longest period of growth in the United  States,  the
prospects of economic power embodied in the coming of age  of  the  European
Union, and the mirage of unimpeded expansion in Asia and Latin America.

A naive confidence prevailed that prosperity was the guaranteed  outcome  of
the third wave of globalisation. This wave  of  globalisation,  which  began
around 1980, had at its heart three broad characteristics. Firstly, a  large
group of developing countries  accounting  for  some  three  billion  people
became players in global  markets.  Secondly,  international  migration  and
capital movements increased dramatically,  reshaping  trading  patterns  and
ownership structures. Thirdly, for some developing countries, many  of  them
in Africa, globalisation has meant increased marginalisation.

Unprecedented prosperity and wealth in the developed nations  of  the  world
have created  opportunities  for  growth  and  trade  for  other  countries.
However, these benefits have not  been  distributed  equally.  The  bulk  of
capital flows remains between the  rich  countries  of  the  world.  Foreign
direct investment per capita in the United States is  around  $3Â 200,  while
in Africa it is a paltry $124 per person.

And a naive definition of success blunted the world's commitment to  address
poverty.  It  ignored  local  realities,  cultures,  and  needs.  It  sought
simplistic solutions to complex problems. In the aftermath of September  11,
2001, we again face the risk of easy diagnosis. Of course  terrorism  is  an
evil that must be countered. But this must not be allowed to become  another
burden laid indiscriminately on the shoulders of the poor.  [Applause.]  And
we must not allow the war on poverty to become hostage to another agenda.

The  poor,  as  history  has  shown,  are  remarkably   peace-loving.   More
importantly, it is often the poorest of the poor  who  are  the  victims  of
violence and terrorism. We must be clear about the fact that the  reason  we
need to combat poverty is that it deprives individuals  and,  by  extension,
societies, of their full potential. It robs children of their childhood.  It
condemns adults to illiteracy.  It  deprives  people  of  access  to  simple
necessities such as safe  drinking  water.  It  condemns  many  millions  to
disease. It wears down the human spirit and robs people  of  their  dignity.
We must fight poverty, because until it has  been  overcome  we  cannot  lay
claim to being a compassionate society.

We who are born into the  cradle  of  humanity  have  a  responsibility  for
remaining activists  for  a  more  compassionate  society;  a  society  that
recognises and respects the richness of different  cultures  and  languages,
the humanity of all the world's people; a  society  that  is  intolerant  of
poverty; a society that recognises that the life of a  Mozambican  child  is
as precious as that of an American child ... [Applause] ... a  society  that
accepts that poverty anywhere lessens the humanity of every citizen  of  the
globe; a global society that actively seeks human solidarity.

As Rorty wrote:


  Solidarity is not discovered by reflection but created. It is created  by
  increasing our sensitivity to the particular  details  of  the  pain  and
  humiliation of other, unfamiliar sorts of people.

From the global economic perspective the challenge we now face is to  ensure
that the gains that have been made through this wave  of  globalisation  can
be extended to eliminate poverty and improve equity in the poorest parts  of
the world. As Nobel laureate, economist Joe Stiglitz reminds us:  ``Each  of
the most  successful  globalising  countries  determined  its  own  pace  of
change;  each  made  sure  that  as  it  grew  the  benefits   were   shared
equitably.''

Kolu  hlahlo  lwabiwomali  siza   kunyusa   inkam-nkam   ngama-50   eerandi.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] Ukususela ngomhla woku-1 kuApreli inkam-nkam iza kuba  ngama-
620 eerandi ngenyanga. [Kwaqhwatywa.] Isondlo sabantwana siza kunyuka ngama-
20 eerandi,  sibe  li-130  eerandi.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of  Xhosa
paragraph follows.)

[In  this  budget  we  shall  increase  the  old-age  pension   by   R50.00.
[Applause.] From 1 April the old-age pension  will  be  R620.00  per  month.
[Applause.]  The  children's  grant  will  go  up  by  R20.00  to   R130.00.
[Applause.]

I think we should all join together in saying: ``Wagwetywa ndlala!  [Hunger,
your time is up!]'' [Applause.]

Siza kuqesha amapolisa  angamawaka  ali-16  ukuze  silwe  ulwaphulo-mthetho.
Siza kuxhasa  iinkonzo  zamahala,  sithobe  nerhafu.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  Nakulo
nyaka siyaphinda sithi, eli lixesha lokuba  sixhamle  iziqhamo  zenkululeko.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[We shall employ 16 000 police personnel with a view  to  crime  prevention.
We shall support free services and reduce the tax.  [Applause.]  Again  this
year we say this is the time to enjoy the fruit of freedom. [Applause.]]

And so in this Budget we are able, once again, to harvest the  sweet  fruits
of the progress we have made. The 2002 Budget:


  -    gives  priority  to  reducing  poverty  and  vulnerability   through
       sustained economic growth;
  -   increases spending on social  grants,  municipal  infrastructure  and
       housing,  improved  police  and   justice   services   and   critical
       administrative services to citizens;


  -   supports an enhanced programme to address the impact of HIV/Aids;


  -   gives continued emphasis to infrastructure investment and support  to
       urban and rural development;


  -   strengthens the fight against crime;


  -   steps up assistance to communities to improve  access  to  affordable
       basic services; and


  -   as we said, gives generous tax relief to all.

We recognise the importance of taking charge of our destiny and  of  finding
solutions that are appropriate to our needs and circumstances.

Our response has been to seek a partnership with the global economy and,  in
particular,  the  wealthy  nations  of  the  world  and   the   multilateral
institutions: a partnership built  on  trust,  respect  and,  above  all,  a
commitment to succeed; a partnership designed to improve the quality of  the
lives of all the people of our continent, and particularly the poor. But  it
is also a partnership that will contribute positively to global  growth  and
prosperity. We take pride in the role that  our  President  has  played  and
continues to play in shaping the New Partnership for  Africa's  Development,
Nepad. [Applause.] As South Africans we  have  a  shared  responsibility  to
ensure that this partnership takes root and grows.

It is our intention to place firmly on the agenda of  the  global  discourse
the values and principles that have guided our young  democracy.  The  World
Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in Johannesburg in August  this
year provides a unique opportunity to arrive at a  global  partnership  that
will embody these values.

The Johannesburg conference is preceded by a  conference  on  Financing  for
Development in Monterrey, Mexico, where, as one of  two  special  envoys  of
the Secretary-General of the  United  Nations,  I  will  have  the  task  of
challenging my colleagues, the Ministers of finance of developed  countries,
to commit to a meaningful compact on the resources required for  sustainable
development. Another opportunity arises from the fact that  as  of  November
last year South Africa has occupied the chair of the Development  Committee,
which is the policy-making committee that governs the World Bank. It is  our
clear intention to use this  opportunity  to  focus  the  attention  of  the
multilateral institutions on a programme of  action  designed  to  eliminate
poverty.

But South Africa's role in other multilateral institutions also needs to  be
recognised. The role that my colleague Minister Alec Erwin  played  in  Doha
in shaping a development round in the World Trade Organisation needs  to  be
commended because it gives form and character to what  we  need  to  achieve
around the world. [Applause.]
South Africa's appointment to the chair of the council of the World  Customs
Organisation in June last year also reflects the integration of our  economy
into the world economy and establishes the SA Revenue Service as a  reliable
partner in trade administration.  It  also  provides  another  forum  within
which to advance the interests of developing  economies  and  the  goals  of
Nepad.

Economic outlook

Another Nobel economics laureate and philosopher, Amartya Sen, has for  many
years articulated a profound  and  nuanced  understanding  of  the  need  to
address broader social policy  concerns  alongside  growth  as  an  economic
goal. Public action in areas such as education, health, social  development,
security, land reform and housing are critical  to  a  development  strategy
that places at its core the need to eradicate poverty and  create  a  better
life for all citizens.

Our economic policy over the past  seven  years  has  been  shaped  by  this
commitment. The choices we  have  made  are  designed  to  ensure  that  our
economy grows sustainably and that more and more of our people share in  the
benefits of that growth.

[Today's budget has  five  objectives  of  bringing  about  development  and
fighting against poverty. Firstly, it encourages economic growth.  Secondly,
it fights poverty by increasing the old-age  grant  and  the  child  support
grant and puts  money  towards  the  fight  against  HIV/Aids.  Thirdly,  it
develops rural areas and townships.  Fourthly,  it  employs  16  000  police
officers to fight crime. [Applause.] Fifthly, it decreases interest rates.]

The Budget we Table in this House today  makes  five  key  interventions  in
support of development and the war against poverty. Firstly, this Budget  is
strongly oriented towards growth, providing for an average increase in  real
spending of over 4% a year for the next three years. Secondly,  it  provides
for  an  intensification  of  spending  on  alleviating  poverty,  including
increases in old-age pensions and  child  support  grants  and  an  enhanced
response  to  HIV/Aids.  Thirdly,   there   is   increased   investment   in
infrastructure,  particularly  in  support  of  urban  renewal   and   rural
development. Fourthly, it strengthens the fight against  crime  by,  amongst
other things, making available the resources to employ an additional  16Â 000
policemen and policewomen. Fifthly, it provides tax  cuts  for  individuals,
further tax incentives for investment and a more  generous  tax  regime  for
small businesses.

This  Budget  has  been  crafted  against  the  background  of  considerable
uncertainty about the growth prospects for the  global  economy.  The  rapid
growth that characterised the latter part of the 1990s stalled in 2001.  The
US economy descended into a recession last year, from which it  is  expected
to make a mild  recovery  this  year.  Although  initially  expected  to  be
relatively immune to the investment collapse in the  US,  Europe's  economic
performance was affected. Germany in  particular  has  experienced  a  sharp
slowdown. The Japanese economy remains trapped in a recession from which  it
is unlikely to recover in the year  ahead.  The  outlook  for  the  emerging
market economies also remains subdued. The collapse  of  Argentina  and  the
fragile position of Turkey are likely to remain points of vulnerability  for
other emerging markets.

It is worth noting that this is the first  time  since  the  mid-1970s  that
there has been such a comprehensive slowdown  in  the  global  economy.  The
advanced economies are expected to grow by 0,6% this year.

Amidst this, South Africa's economy has shown impressive resilience.  It  is
easily forgotten that the average rate of growth in real  GDP  between  1994
and 2000 was 2,7%. If we exclude 1998, a year of  exceptional  international
turmoil due to the Asian financial crisis,  average  growth  was  3,1%.  The
economy grew by 3,4% in 2000 and about 2,2%  last  year,  underpinned  by  a
moderate recovery of investment and  a  strong  export  performance  in  the
first half of last year.

But, of course, our economy is not immune to the international  developments
which have temporarily unsettled growth and  inflation  trends.  Growth  for
2002 is expected  to  be  2,3%,  rising  to  3,3%  next  year.  Against  the
background of an unexpected depreciation of the rand in the second  half  of
last year, we now expect inflation to pick up moderately this year.

But the growth of our economy has been underpinned by  extensive  structural
reforms designed to ensure a more dynamic and resilient economy.


  -   Export diversification continues, both in nontraditional manufactured
       goods and in tourism-related trade and growth  in  services  exports.
       Manufactured exports grew from 9% to 20%  of  GDP  between  1990  and
       2000.


  -   The balance of payments is immeasurably stronger and better  able  to
       sustain growth - the current account will register a moderate deficit
       of 0,5% of GDP this year.


  -   Real wages and productivity have increased by a  whopping  20%  since
       1994, bringing rising living standards  to  millions  of  people  and
       strengthening the competitiveness of industry.


  -   The net open forward  position  has  been  reduced  from  some  US$24
       billion in 1998 to just under $3 billion in  January  of  this  year.
       [Applause.]


  -   The budget deficit is expected to be  2,1%  of  GDP  in  the  2002-03
       fiscal year, falling to 1,7% in 2004-05.

Numerous explanations have been advanced for the depreciation  of  the  rand
in the fourth quarter of 2001. The underlying health of  the  South  African
economy is not in question. Indeed the international rating  agency  Moody's
provided a strong endorsement  of  our  economic  policies  by  raising  our
credit rating to Baa2.

It is widely acknowledged that the depreciation of  the  rand  in  the  last
quarter of last year was overdone. In an attempt to better  understand  what
occasioned the sharp decline of the exchange rate in  the  last  quarter  of
last year, a  commission  has  been  set  up  headed  by  Adv  Myburgh.  The
commission's preliminary report is expected by the end of April.

Rising prices impact negatively on the poor and most vulnerable, and so  the
lowering of CPIX inflation from 7,7% in 2000 to 6,6% last year represents  a
significant advance. The Governor of the SA Reserve Bank, Mr  Tito  Mboweni,
must be commended for the way in which the bank has managed monetary  policy
during difficult and uncertain times. [Applause.]

This year we will see a temporary rise in inflation as the  economy  adjusts
to last year's depreciation, and we now expect CPIX to  average  6,9%,  just
outside the 3%-6%  range.  However,  the  underlying  inflation  outlook  is
firmly downwards, and both  the  Government  and  the  Reserve  Bank  remain
confident that CPIX will return to the target range in 2003 and beyond.

Although the overall inflation trend remains muted, we are aware  that  food
prices have increased sharply. The rise in the  maize  price  in  particular
affects the  poor  and  most  vulnerable.  The  markets  for  grains,  meat,
vegetables  and  related  products  are  unavoidably  affected  by  seasonal
factors and international  developments  in  commodity  prices,  and  so  we
should expect a greater variation in food prices than the overall CPI.

For three of the past four years food prices have  increased  by  less  than
other consumer goods. But it is clearly important that  we  avoid  an  undue
rise in the prices of essential staple foods. Therefore  the  President  has
requested the Departments of Trade and Industry and of Agriculture to  do  a
thorough investigation, and a report is  expected  shortly.  We  would  like
once  more  to  appeal  to  the  players  in  this  sector  to  keep  prices
appropriately related to costs. It would clearly be  in  no  one's  interest
for the benefits of a more competitive agricultural marketing system  to  be
lost in  the  pursuit  of  short-term  opportunistic  and  predatory  gains.
[Applause.]

Viewed against the  rapid  changes  in  the  global  economy  and  the  deep
structural reforms we have undertaken in the past six years,  our  economy's
growth performance has been  remarkable.  But  employment  creation  remains
weak and efforts to accelerate investment and  training  and  promote  small
business development have not yet turned the employment trend around.

We believe that the economy's potential is  infinitely  greater.  Unleashing
this potential requires that we act together as a nation;  that  we  embrace
the spirit of Vukuzenzele, and allow the needs,  aspirations  and  interests
of our country and economy to shape our respective  roles,  responsibilities
and responses; that we act  now,  together,  energetically  to  realise  the
potential of our country. Government alone cannot  take  responsibility  for
growth and development. It is a collective responsibility. We need,  all  of
us, to accept that and commit to a compact that recognises  that  the  power
to make a difference rests with all of us.

Such a compact would need to address a  key  element  in  our  economic  and
social landscape. This  element,  which  is  hard  to  define  precisely  or
adequately quantify in economic models, is confidence. It  is  the  need  to
understand that we all have a part to play in shaping  our  common  destiny.
In our  generation  vests  the  responsibility  to  build  human  solidarity
actively, to push back poverty, to build a  compassionate,  caring  society.
It is our task to identify the challenges and grasp the opportunities.

Opportunities can arise in surprising ways. We initiated  a  project  called
``Tips for Trevor''. The idea is that South Africans from all walks of  life
are invited to write to the Minister with tips as to what they think  should
be in the Budget. About two weeks  ago  one  of  our  very  tired  officials
inadvertently gave a telephone number for the Ministry which turned  out  to
be the  number  of  Butler's  Pizza  in  Gardens.  Butler's  phones  started
ringing, not with pizza orders but with tips for the Minister. They  thought
it was about dough, but it turned out to be a different kind of  dough  from
what they used in pizzas. It took very little time to  convert  an  annoying
situation into a business opportunity. They  approached  our  communications
manager and proposed that, in return for the tips they  had  received,  they
wanted a picture with the Minister.  A  strange  ambition!  They  also  very
generously donated 60 pizzas to an exhausted and hungry  Treasury  team.  We
thank them and apologise for the mix-up. [Applause.] We will  declare  those
pizzas, Madam Speaker! [Laughter.]

Similarly, when  we  called  upon  Mr  Hannes  Rabie  at  his  farm  Nuwerus
yesterday to share  some  of  his  Hanepoot  harvest  with  the  members  of
Parliament here today, he jumped at the opportunity  -  mahala!  [Laughter.]
And he offered, bab'uShenge, that  we  should  return  next  year  for  even
sweeter fruit. [Laughter.]

These two stories capture the spirit of South Africa's wonderful people.

The Budget framework

2001 Budget outcome

This Budget extends the growth-oriented fiscal stance of  the  2001  Budget,
providing for strong real increases in  spending  and  significant  cuts  in
taxes. Although the economy did slow down last  year,  we  have  again  seen
strong revenue performance and sound debt management.
The projected outcome for 2001-02 is dominated by  strong  tax  performance.
Revenue is projected to be about R15 billion higher than  we  budgeted  for.
[Applause.]  Supplementary  allocations  raise  total  expenditure  by  R4,3
billion.

Of the additional spending this year, R2 billion goes to  provinces  to  pay
the backlogs in social security payments  that  the  President  referred  to
last Thursday. [Applause.] An amount of R130 million is set  aside  for  our
military operations in support of democracy in  Burundi  and  the  remainder
funds unavoidable and unforeseeable expenditure approved  by  Parliament  in
the Adjustments Estimate in November last year. [Applause.]

The Budget deficit for the current fiscal year is expected  to  be  1,4%  of
GDP. [Applause.]

2002 Budget priorities

The good news is, of course, that the improvement  in  our  fiscal  position
means that we can sustainably increase public spending,  thereby  increasing
the potential of all of our people  to  contribute  to  social  development.
Main Budget expenditure will be financed through moderate growth in  revenue
and a deficit of 2,1% of GDP in 2002-03, decreasing to  1,7%  in  the  third
year of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework.

The  2002  Budget  directs  more  resources  towards  reducing  poverty  and
vulnerability amongst our  people;  educating  our  children;  training  and
developing  skills  amongst  our  youth;  building  and  enhancing  physical
infrastructure and basic municipal  services;  and  making  our  communities
safer places in which to live, work and play.

Real noninterest spending across national and  provincial  governments  will
grow by 4,1% a year over the next three years. In nominal  terms,  it  rises
from R256 billion in the Budget we will table  today  to  R298  billion  two
years later.

Prudent fiscal management has resulted  in  lower  interest  costs,  thereby
releasing some R10 billion of additional resources for spending on  services
over the next three years. Debt service costs  are  expected  to  fall  from
4,8% of GDP in the present fiscal year to 4,4% next year and 4,1% two  years
later. What this means is that whereas in 1998-99 we were spending 20,2%  of
our Budget on interest costs - we  remember  that  debate  because  we  were
concerned that these costs would soon  overtake  education  as  the  largest
expenditure item - for 2002-03 this comes down to 15,7% ... [Applause.]  ...
and is expected to fall below 15% by the third year of  the  MTEF.  This  is
clearly a policy choice that has  started  to  pay  dividends.  It  releases
resources that we can now spend on that which  makes  a  difference  to  the
lives of our people right now.

The outstanding revenue performance for this year is largely the outcome  of
a sharp improvement in company tax receipts. The robust revenue trend  makes
possible substantial relief to taxpayers again in  the  2002  Budget,  which
will in turn contribute to a recovery in  household  spending  and  economic
growth over the medium term.

The Main Budget provides for expenditure of  R287,9  billion  in  the  first
year, rising to R334,6 billion  two  years  later.  Revenue  increases  from
R265,2 billion to R313,2 billion over the same period.

After setting aside provision for debt costs and  the  contingency  reserve,
the framework  provides  for  total  allocations  to  national  departments,
provinces and assistance for local  government  of  R237,1  billion  in  the
first year, rising to R273,1 billion two years later.

Recognising that the depreciation of the rand will impact on  inflation  and
Public Service salary adjustments in 2002, the revised framework includes  a
R3,3 billion contingency reserve in the first year, rising to R9 billion  in
the third year. The reserve also provides  for  possible  unforeseeable  and
unavoidable expenditure in the budget year and  macroeconomic  uncertainties
or new priorities in the years ahead. Supplementary  funds  are  once  again
set aside for new infrastructure spending.

The 2002 Budget framework creates an enabling environment that allows us  to
respond creatively to the challenges  of  social  development  and  work  in
partnership with communities to build a healthy, vibrant future for all.

Our response is balanced, yet it reflects the tough  choices  that  we  have
made.  It  ensures  that  spending  is  affordable   and   sustainable   and
contributes effectively towards achieving  our  broad  social  and  economic
policy  objectives.  These  include  enhancing  economic  growth   and   job
creation, deepening equity and  social  development  and  strengthening  the
safety and justice sector.

Investing in growth

Recognising the need to reinforce the growth momentum of  the  economy,  the
2002 Budget aims to invigorate several key policy initiatives.

As in last year's Budget, investment in infrastructure  is  prioritised.  In
addition  to  national  and  provincial  capital  spending,  the  investment
programmes of public enterprises and public-private  partnership  agreements
- including transport projects, Government buildings and several  ecotourism
initiatives - will contribute significantly to building productive  capacity
in the years ahead.

Economic performance is also enhanced by a cluster of  measures  focused  on
enhancing the quality of public spending. These include the overhaul of  the
shape and organisation of the public finances and  a  robust  new  framework
for  financial  accountability  across  all  three  spheres  of  government.
Managerial capacity-building programmes have been strengthened,  information
systems upgraded and financial management training enhanced.

The most important contribution Government  makes  to  long-run  growth  and
development is investing in people. The Human Resource Development  Strategy
launched in April last year sets the framework for developing our  country's
skills base. Reshaping our universities and technikons,  improving  learning
and teaching in schools and creating new skills development  programmes  for
workers and work-seekers are amongst the key elements of  the  strategy  for
human development. To  these  we  will  add  in  the  years  ahead  the  new
learnership incentive and the programmes of the Umsobomvu Fund.

Division of revenues

The 2002 framework allows for additional spending of R13,4 billion in  2002-
03, rising to R17,9 billion two years later.  These  numbers  are  over  and
above the forward estimates we set out last year.


  -   Over the MTEF period, additional allocations totalling R20,5  billion
       are proposed for provinces, mainly in response to the  rapid  take-up
       of the child support grant - last week the President asked all  South
       Africans to participate in this campaign to ensure that children  are
       signed up to this  programme  -  and  to  reinforce  both  human  and
       physical capability in the health system to  address  the  impact  of
       communicable diseases such as TB, malaria and HIV/Aids.
  -   A further R6,8 billion is proposed in support of local government  to
       strengthen basic municipal service provision to poor  households  and
       to manage the impact of the municipal demarcation processes  and  the
       institutional restructuring of service delivery systems.


  -   Supplementary allocations to national departments include  some  R6,6
       billion  for  the  criminal  justice  sector  to  employ   additional
       personnel, strengthen the administration of  justice,  improve  court
       services  and  build  additional  prison  accommodation.  [Applause.]
       Additional allocations are also directed towards  key  administrative
       services,  including  modernising  the  information  systems  of  the
       Departments of Home Affairs and of Defence, which are compensated for
       the effects of the depreciation of the rand on their costs.

Given that most of our social spending is  in  the  provincial  sphere,  the
biggest transfers in the Budget are to this sphere, rising  from  a  revised
level of R121,2 billion in the present fiscal year to R132,4 billion in  the
new year and R152,4 billion two  years  later.  This  represents  an  annual
average growth rate of 7,9% over the next three years.

With stable finances and improved financial management,  the  strong  growth
in transfers to provinces will reinforce the accelerated  delivery  of  pro-
poor programmes. They should enable provinces to build  and  improve  social
and economic infrastructure such  as  hospitals,  schools  and  roads.  They
should allow them to strengthen their  capacity  to  deliver  better-quality
services by employing more doctors and nurses, and to increase  the  amounts
for old age pensions and child support grants.

But the biggest increases in  this  budget  go  to  local  government,  only
because Minister Mufamadi is my  benchmate.  [Laughter.]  [Applause.]  These
allocations rise by 18,3% a year over the  MTEF  period.  Total  allocations
rise from R6,6 billion in the present year to R8,6 billion in the  new  year
and R10,9 billion in 2004-05. [Applause.] This reflects Government's  strong
commitment to the delivery of basic municipal  services  and  infrastructure
to the poorest of our people. Now that  our  municipalities  have  completed
their transition, residents are dependent on  them  to  roll  out  essential
infrastructure. Poor areas that fall within  the  nodes  identified  in  the
rural development and urban renewal programmes are given an extra  boost  of
funds to accelerate the pace of alleviating poverty in the poorest areas  of
our country.

The municipal infrastructure programme  increases  from  R2,2  billion  this
year to over R4 billion in the year ending 31 March  2005.  [Applause.]  The
housing subsidy allocations grow from R3,2 billion to R4,3 billion over  the
MTEF period.

This year around 30 municipalities  will,  for  the  first  time,  implement
three-year budgets for their new  2002-03  budgets.  The  Local  Government:
Municipal Finance Management Bill, currently before  Parliament,  will  also
give legislative effect to financial management reforms in this sphere.

National expenditure proposals

Details of national departments' spending plans for  the  next  three  years
are again this year set out in the Estimates of National  Expenditure.  That
is the big book that we are tabling here. Members will find in it  a  wealth
of information, some 820 pages of departmental aims and  objectives,  policy
developments, programme expenditure  estimates,  service  delivery  outputs,
indicators and targets. Hon members will be pleased to learn that I  do  not
propose to list the full set of measurable objectives by  programme,  but  I
would urge members to exploit to the full this valuable  compendium.  Hidden
in this  volume  and  departments'  published  annual  reports  there  is  a
remarkable record of our development and progress:


  -   In fighting cholera in KwaZulu-Natal, the Department of Water Affairs
       and Forestry provided 100Â 000  people  with  safe  water  and  52Â 000
       people with ventilated pit latrines. [Applause.]


  -   Some 20 300 land restitution cases have been settled,  returning  300
       000 hectares to 44Â 246 households.


  -   Social development and welfare  departments  pay  1Â 942Â 000  old  age
       pensions and 706Â 000 disability grants every  month.  There  are  1,7
       million children registered for child support grants now.


  -   Migration officials registered 6 million visitors passing through our
       borders last year.


  -   In 2001 the Department of Agriculture eradicated 40Â 000 hopper  bands
       and 9Â 000 swarms of locusts. I had to check that these were not  hip-
       hop bands, but bands of locusts. [Laughter.]


  -   The regional task forces of Minister Tshwete have seized  101,6  tons
       of dagga and recovered 2Â 595 head of stolen livestock. [Applause.]  I
       do not know about the cloud cover from this 101,6 tons of dagga.


  -   The national Health department distributed 310 million  condoms  last
       year. There were over 429Â 000 admissions to our hospitals for complex
       tertiary care. Our antimalaria vector control programme saw over  1,1
       million households sprayed last year.


  -   The Government Communication  and  Information  System  records  that
       there are 909Â 679 pages registered on Government websites.


   Madam Speaker, I am sure you did  not  know  that  last  year  Parliament
   received 279Â 696 incoming telephone  calls,  of  which  37Â 744  were  not
   answered. [Laughter.]

There is more to the Budget, of  course,  than  the  statistics  that  track
expenditure and services. But by monitoring and reporting on  progress,  and
quantifying plans and targets, we hope to reinforce and empower  this  House
and the public in holding our departments accountable. [Applause.]

Investing in people

Turning now to the expenditure proposals, we note that investing  in  people
is again the foremost priority in the Budget.

Education and skills development

Spending on education is 24% of noninterest expenditure - the  lion's  share
of the allocations.

Consolidated spending on  education  (national  and  provincial  government)
rises to R59,8 billion in 2002-03 and is  estimated  to  increase  to  R68,3
billion by the third year of the MTEF.

For 2002-03 projected revenue from the skills  development  levy,  which  my
colleague Minister Mdladlana, who is away today, spoke about last week,  and
which is drawn from a 1% levy on payroll, is expected to be  R2,95  billion.
Our plea must be that this be used for the training of people.  Critical  to
the success of this initiative is the partnership that is  required  between
Government and  business  so  as  to  ensure  that  the  skills  development
programmes being implemented are  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  a
particular sector.

The Umsobomvu Fund has youth development as its focus. Since its  inception,
the fund has initiated a number of projects including the creation of  pilot
youth advisory centres, the launch of  community  youth  service  programmes
and the establishment of school-to-work pilot projects. This year  the  fund
will launch new initiatives to provide  young  entrepreneurs,  primarily  in
the small business sector, with business advisory support. [Applause.]

Social security grants and welfare services

Go tloga kajeno motente o tlile go oketswa ka di 1 Moranang, mme e  seng  ka
di 1 Phukwi. Go tloga ka di 1 Moranang, motente o oketswa ka  R50.  O  tlile

support grant a oketswa ka R20. A tlile go nna R130 ka kgwedi, go  tloga  ka
Moranang. Tlala e mo kotsing! [Legofi.] (Translation of  Setswana  paragraph
follows.)

[As from today the old age pension will be  increased  with  effect  from  1
April and not 1 July. As from 1 April the old age pension will be  increased
by R50 to make it R620 per month. [Applause.] The child support  grant  will
be increased by R20 to make it R130 per month  with  effect  from  1  April.
Hunger is in trouble! [Applause.]]

I want us to say together, ``Tlala e mo  kotsing!''  [Applause.]  For  those
who do not know, we are saying, ``Hunger is in trouble.''

Besteding op maatskaplike dienste en toelaes vorm  'n  belangrike  deel  van
provinsiale begrotings en styg tot R34,3 miljard in die finansiÃ«le jaar  wat
eindig 31 Maart 2004. Die stelsel  van  maatskaplike  toelaes  is  die  mees
effektiewe manier om armoede te verlig.  Met  effek  van  hierdie  Begroting
word die datum vir verhogings  in  maatskaplike  toelaes  vervroeg  vanaf  1
Julie tot 1 April, dit wil sÃª die begin van die finansiÃ«le jaar.

Vanaf April hierdie jaar, sal ons meer geld in die hande  van  vier  miljoen
mense plaas wanneer ons ouderdomspensioene  en  ander  maatskaplike  toelaes
tot R620 per maand verhoog. [Applous.] Dit is baie goeie nuus en  sal  bydra
daartoe om die daaglikse bestaan vir baie arm gesinne draagliker te maak.

Ons wil ook hulle wat na jong kinders omsien, bystaan deur  die  waarde  van
die kindertoelae met R20 tot R130 per maand te verhoog  en  ook  die  toelae
uit te brei na 'n verdere 1,2 miljoen kinders teen die  einde  van  volgende
jaar. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Expenditure on social services and grants constitutes an important part  of
provincial budgets and will rise to R34,3  billion  in  the  financial  year
ending on 31 March 2004. The system of social grants is the  most  effective
way of alleviating poverty. With effect  from  this  Budget,  the  date  for
social grant increases will be advanced from 1 July to  1  April,  in  other
words to the start of the financial year.

From April of this year we will be putting more money in the hands  of  four
million people when we increase old age pensions and other social grants  to
R620 per month. [Applause.] This is very good news,  which  will  contribute
towards making the daily existence of very poor families more bearable.

We also want to support those who care for small children by increasing  the
amount of the child support grant by  R20  to  R130  a  month  and  also  by
extending the grant to an additional 1,2 million  children  by  the  end  of
next year.]

I do not know if my mom got that,  but  spending  on  welfare  services  and
social security grants forms a significant share of provincial budgets.  The
social grant system is our most effective tool in alleviating poverty.  What
we are doing is, instead of increasing  pensions  from  1  July,  increasing
them from 1 April. Pensions are being increased by R50 to R620 a  month  and
child support grants from R110 to R130 a month, and we want to  extend  this
to a further R1,2 million children by the end of next year. [Applause.]

Health care

This  Budget  contains  significant  measures  to  strengthen  the  national
HIV/Aids programme. In addition to an estimated R4 billion  currently  spent
by provincial health departments  on  Aids-related  illnesses,  funding  for
prevention programmes in schools and  communities,  hospital  treatment  and
community-care programmes will amount to R1,0 billion next year,  rising  to
R1,8 billion two years later. [Applause.] This includes a progressive  roll-
out  of  a  programme  to  prevent  mother-to-child  transmission   at   the
conclusion of the current  trials.  Medication  for  the  treatment  of  TB,
pneumonia and other opportunistic infections is also included.

Conditional grants to provinces play a significant role  in  funding  health
services. The tertiary services and  training  grants  are  rationalised  in
support of  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  services  over  time.  The
National Tertiary Service Grant amounts to R3,7 billion in the  new  Budget,
increasing to R4,2 billion in the third year. It will  fund  tertiary  units
in 27 hospitals, facilitating a redistribution of health services  from  the
Western  Cape  and  Gauteng  to  other  provinces  where  poverty  is   more
prevalent.

The Health Professional Training  and  Development  grant  rises  from  R1,3
billion in this Budget to R1,4 billion by the third year and provides for  a
phased increase in the number  of  medical  specialists  and  registrars  in
underserved provinces. Over the next three years R1,6  billion  is  directed
toward modernising hospitals, ensuring better tertiary  health  care,  while
improvements to hospital management receive  targeted  funding  rising  from
R124 million in the first year to R138 million in the third.

Facing the infrastructure challenge and investing in economic development

Increased funding of physical construction is again prioritised, as we  have
said, and steps have been taken to improve  the  capacity  to  spend.  Well-
designed investment in economic infrastructure and services has  significant
potential to enhance growth and improve services and opportunities for  poor
people.

This year the Budget does the following:


  -   It steps up allocations for electrification to R950 million  a  year,
       supporting Eskom's drive to electrify rural communities. [Applause.]


  -   It increases spending on roads  and  rail  services  by  R1  billion,
       ensuring that rehabilitation and investment raises economic  activity
       and provides both development and safety in rail and road  transport.
       I thank Jeremy for applauding! [Laughter.]


  -   It sets aside R80 million for the hosting  of  the  World  Summit  on
       Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in August.


  -   It boosts spending on Water Affairs and Forestry to R3,6  billion  in
       the first year in support of investment in rural water and sanitation
       infrastructure. [Applause.]


  -   It directs R300 million a year to the Post Office to  assist  further
       restructuring that will facilitate the roll-out of infrastructure and
       services to underserved areas.


  -    It  allocates  R741  million  for  restructuring  the   Unemployment
       Insurance Fund, ensuring that benefits are more effectively  targeted
       and the financial viability of the fund is improved.
  -   It raises provision for sustainable land reform to  R1,1  billion  in
       2004-05, contributing to development and job creation in rural areas.
       I hope that allows my colleague to complete the work as the President
       directed last week.


  -   It sets aside R700 million in the first year, rising to R2 billion in
       2004-05, for infrastructure investment in support of rural and  urban
       development.

Provincial spending on social and economic infrastructure has  improved  and
municipal  infrastructure  financing  receives  substantial   increases   in
allocations over the next three years.

Development partnerships with local government

We  must  recognise  that  development  is  not   only   about   large-scale
infrastructure programmes,  wide-reaching  income  support  or  high-profile
health campaigns. For many, real development happens  when  people's  access
to services and opportunities within their own  communities  improves;  when
they are able to open the door to their house, drink  water  that  is  clean
and safe from disease, switch on an electric light and watch their  children
kick a soccer ball around the community soccer  ground.  Building  a  better
life for all is therefore a challenge that we share with communities.

Spending plans set out in this year's  Budget  encourage  partnerships  with
communities, building solidarity as we  join  hands  to  improve  access  to
affordable basic services. Increased funds are allocated to step up  housing
and municipal infrastructure programmes, focusing on water,  sanitation  and
electrification.

We are making good progress in the first  pilot  projects  identified  under
the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development and Urban  Renewal  programmes.
In these areas, national and provincial departments will work with  councils
and local organisations to improve services, create  business  opportunities
and build strong and thriving communities.
Strengthening the fight against crime

Social progress  also  rests  on  effectively  combating  crime  and  making
communities safer places to live, work  and  play.  We  are  resolute  about
strengthening the fight against crime.

Over the next three years, an additional R5,2 billion  will  go  the  Safety
and Security Vote. This allows, as  we  said  earlier,  16Â 000  more  police
personnel to be employed to reduce crime in areas  that  are  identified  as
crime hot-spots, working in close co-operation with communities  to  improve
their everyday safety and security.

More police officials on the beat will lead to more arrests.  These  arrests
place a further burden on an already  stressed  judicial  system.  Over  the
next three years a further R826 million will  help  efforts  to  restructure
and streamline operations in the administration of justice, enhancing  court
efficiency and raising the overall efficacy of the criminal justice system.

Once criminals are prosecuted and found guilty, they  are  sentenced  to  an
appropriate prison term. A rapid increase in  the  prisoner  population  has
contributed to significant overcrowding in prisons across  the  country.  We
estimate that our daily average prisoner population will rise to 225Â 600  by
the third year of the MTEF. Budgeted spending on the  Correctional  Services
Vote increases from R6,9 billion in the 2002 fiscal  year  to  R8,1  billion
two years later to fund increased operational costs associated  with  higher
prisoner numbers and expanding prison capacity.

The Defence Force is involved in diverse  activities,  including  operations
to combat crime, patrolling  the  country's  borders  and  rural  areas  and
fulfilling international obligations  in  providing  peace  support  in  the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and the Horn of Africa.

Increases on the Defence Vote will provide  for  the  higher  costs  of  the
strategic  defence  procurement  programme  due  to  revised  exchange  rate
projections. Provision is also made for the protection mission  to  Burundi,
the costs of which will be partly recovered from international donors.  This
rise in spending brings total defence expenditure to 1,7% of GDP in the  new
year, compared with 3,7% a decade ago and 1,5% in 1997-98. [Applause.]

Revenue trends and tax proposals

The past fiscal year turned in  yet  another  buoyant  revenue  performance,
following  comprehensive  tax  policy  reforms  and  further   advances   in
restructuring the Revenue Service and collection processes.

In this year's Budget,  Government  continues  to  provide  substantial  tax
relief for individuals and seeks to improve further  the  effectiveness  and
efficiency of the South African tax structure with  a  view  to  encouraging
investment and reducing the costs of doing business in this country.

Progress on outstanding 2001 tax reform initiatives

As we indicated in the 2001 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement,  this  year
heralds a period of consolidation after the far-reaching income tax  changes
that have been introduced since 2000. We are able to report on  progress  in
several key tax reforms of last year's budget.

We announced the introduction of a wage  incentive  last  year.  Recognising
the importance of investing in skills alongside the  creation  of  jobs,  it
will take the form of an additional tax allowance for  learnerships  offered
by employers. Draft legislation has been released  for  public  comment  and
will be introduced this year. An allowance to employers in  the  form  of  a
R25Â 000 deduction will be permitted when a learnership agreement is  signed,
and a further  R25Â 000  when  the  learnership  is  successfully  completed.
[Applause.] This incentive programme applies  to  all  learnerships  entered
into from 1 October last year and will apply for a five-year period.

An amount of R3  billion  of  foregone  tax  revenue  over  four  years  was
allocated in the Budget last year  to  encourage  investment  projects  with
significant  direct  and   indirect   benefits   for   the   South   African
manufacturing sector. The National Treasury and the Department of Trade  and
Industry  have  developed  stringent  evaluation  criteria  and  transparent
administrative  processes  that  seek   to   guarantee   that   only   those
applications that significantly raise the  competitiveness  of  the  economy
and create job opportunities are approved. The  programme  is  characterised
by sound governance and parliamentary oversight procedures.  The  Department
of Trade and Industry will begin to process applications shortly.

Last year, Government announced fundamental measures  for  a  more  coherent
tax environment for public benefit organisations.  We  raised  significantly
the thresholds for tax-deductible donations  by  individuals.  In  addition,
the range of deserving public benefit organisations that qualified for  tax-
deductible donations was broadened, including those caring for children  and
the aged, HIV/Aids care and education. Moreover, Government released a  list
of public benefit activities that qualify  an  organisation  for  tax-exempt
status, thereby widening the range of qualifying  organisations.  Underlying
this list of tax-privileged activities is  the  principle  that  these  must
promote social development or meet special needs of the  wider  public,  and
not just a narrowly exclusive group.

The list of organisations qualifying for tax-deductible donations  and  tax-
exempt status will be broadened during the course of the  new  fiscal  year.
The National Treasury and Sars have already met with important  stakeholders
to  discuss  revisions  to  the  public  benefit  activity  lists.  The  new
approach, together with the enhanced capacity of Sars  to  administer  these
incentives,  adds  another  well-targeted  set  of  measures  in  addressing
poverty and vulnerability effectively.

I am pleased to report to the President that the revised list  will  include
the provision of health services to the poor and the care of the  terminally
ill and persons with severe physical or mental impairment.  Furthermore,  we
propose to recognise private contributions to our transfrontier peace  parks
for tax purposes. This  will  encourage  initiatives  that  bring  jobs  and
tourists to  our  region  and  signal  the  spirit  of  partnership  between
nations, and between Government  and  the  private  sector,  that  underpins
Africa's new approach to development.

Growth-enhancing income tax proposals

Personal income tax relief

Personal income tax in South Africa is  still  our  most  important  revenue
source, contributing nearly 37%  of  Main  Budget  revenue  in  the  present
fiscal year. In the 2001 Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement  we  indicated
that increased revenue associated with enhanced tax collection efforts  will
be  returned  to  taxpayers   through   further   relief   to   individuals,
particularly in the lower- and middle-income brackets.

Taking account of the sterling revenue performance of Sars and the tax  base
broadening achieved by introducing the  residence-based  income  tax  system
and capital gains tax,  we  propose  this  year  to  reduce  income  tax  on
individuals by a further R15 billion. [Applause.] Individual  taxpayers  are
therefore  the  primary  beneficiaries  of  the   income-tax-base-broadening
initiatives and improved revenue collection  record.  This  brings  personal
income tax relief since 1995 to R48,6 billion.

The revised tax scales mean the following:


  -   The income tax threshold is raised from R23Â 000 to R27Â 000 a  year  -
       that is, people earning below R27Â 000 a year will pay no income  tax.
       [Applause.]


  -   The tax threshold for taxpayers aged 65 and  over  increases  to  R42
       640. Do I owe Minister Asmal that?


  -   Someone earning R60 000Â a year will pay R1Â 380  less;  those  earning
       R90Â 000 will pay R3Â 480 less.


  -   Rates and bracket adjustments provide relief across the entire income
       tax population, with the  maximum  rate  reduced  from  42%  to  40%.
       [Applause.] I thought that would make us popular in this House today.
       [Laughter.]


  -   Of the total tax relief, 57% accrues to taxpayers earning  less  than
       R150Â 000 a year, 37% accrues to taxpayers  earning  between  R150Â 000
       and R300 000Â a year and 6% to taxpayers earning more than R300Â 000  a
       year.


  -   The average cut for taxpayers in the income group up to  R150Â 000  is
       25%, for taxpayers in the income group of R150Â 000 to R300Â 000 it  is
       14% and for taxpayers earning more than R300Â 000  average  rates  are
       cut by 7%.

This individual tax relief package  contributes  to  reducing  the  cost  of
employment and rewards both work  and  savings.  It  also  narrows  the  gap
between the maximum individual rate and  the  company  rate,  improving  the
integrity and consistency of the tax structure.
Increase of interest and dividend income exemption

Complementing the income tax rate reductions, it  is  proposed  to  increase
the domestic interest and dividend income exemption from the current  R4Â 000
to R6Â 000 for taxpayers under the age of 65 and from R5Â 000 to  R10Â 000  for
taxpayers aged 65 and over. [Applause.] This  measure  provides  substantial
relief for those  living  on  modest  fixed-interest  incomes.  This  relief
measure will cost the fiscus R163 million.

With a view to encouraging taxpayers to make  their  savings  available  for
domestic capital formation, foreign interest and dividends  will  in  future
only be exempt up to R1Â 000 out of the total exemption limit.

Accelerating depreciation allowances for manufacturing plant

South Africa needs to nurture its  economic  growth  and  job  creation.  In
order  to  encourage  investment  in  productive  capacity,  an  accelerated
depreciation allowance  for  a  broad  range  of  new  manufacturing  assets
acquired within three years from 1 March  2002  is  proposed.  These  assets
will be depreciated over four years in contrast with the existing  five-year
period: 40% of the cost of the asset will be deducted in the first year  and
20% of the cost in the subsequent three years. This measure  will  encourage
investment  and  ease  the  impact  on  investing  firms   of   the   recent
depreciation of the rand.

In addition, the monetary threshold for assets acquired on or after 1  March
2002 that may be  immediately  written  off  is  increased  from  R1Â 000  to
R2Â 000. These two measures will cost the fiscus  R295  million  in  the  new
year.

Extending tax and administrative relief for small businesses

Government is very conscious of the needs of the small business sector,  and
the unfolding tax reform programme recognises this sector's  strategic  role
in  economic  growth  and  employment.  Building  on  the  2000   and   2001
concessions, it is proposed to increase the existing threshold of the  first
R100Â 000 of taxable income, which attracts the  15%  graduated  company  tax
rate, to R150Â 000.

The small  business  benefits  are  limited  to  companies  with  an  annual
turnover of less than R1 million. It is proposed to raise this threshold  to
R3 million, with these changes taking effect for  companies  with  years  of
assessment ending on or after 1 April this year. [Applause.]

It is common knowledge that the burden  of  tax  and  regulatory  compliance
impacts adversely on small businesses.  Administrative  procedures  and  the
existing penalty provisions will be reviewed with  the  aim  of  simplifying
tax compliance for small businesses. In addition, a simplified  approach  to
calculating VAT obligations will be investigated.  These  measures  combined
constitute a possible revenue loss of R40 million in the new year.

Review of monetary thresholds

The Income Tax Act contains a number of monetary thresholds that need to  be
adjusted from time to time to take account  of  the  effects  of  inflation.
Taking account of affordability and the economic impact  of  the  threshold,
the following revisions are proposed:


  -   Tax-exempt donations  are  raised  to  R30Â 000  for  individuals  and
       R10Â 000 for companies not considered to be public companies.


  -   The exemption from estate duty is increased to R1,5 million.


  -   Exemptions for bursaries and scholarships are raised.


  -    The  R1Â 000  threshold  for  medical  expense  deductions  will   be
       eliminated.


  -   The exemption from tax for bravery and long-service awards is  raised
       to R5Â 000.


  -   The immediate deduction for intellectual property will  be  increased
       to R5Â 000.

These proposals will result in revenue losses of around R36 million.

Tax simplification and reducing the cost of doing business in South Africa

Limitation of employee deductions

Recognising  that  most  salaried  employees  have  few  expenses  that  are
incurred in the production of their employment income,  it  is  proposed  to
simplify the taxation of employment income by limiting  employee  deductions
to the following:


  -   business travel deductions against car allowance;


  -   certain medical expenses;


  -   contributions to pension and retirement annuity funds;
  -   donations to certain public benefit organisations;


  -   specific expenditure against allowances of holders of public  office;
       and


  -   wear and tear allowances on equipment.

These limitations, which will not apply where an employee's remuneration  is
wholly or mainly derived in the  form  of  commissions  based  on  sales  or
turnover, will come into effect on 1 March this year.

It is also proposed that the R150 a day  allowance,  which  compensates  for
deemed accommodation costs where actual expenses are not claimed, should  be
abolished. Taxpayers  may  still  be  reimbursed  by  employers  for  actual
expenses incurred on accommodation for business  purposes.  The  R65  a  day
allowance for subsistence expenses  will  be  continued.  These  steps  will
increase revenue by around R100 million.

Other administrative reforms

A number of these reforms  are  proposed,  resulting  in  an  estimated  net
revenue loss of R50 million. For example, it is proposed that  the  existing
June  year-end  arrangement  with  certain  farmers,  fishers  and   diamond
diggers, which dates back to  1962,  should  be  terminated.  The  remaining
1Â 000  taxpayers  on  this  system  will  be  brought  into   the   standard
provisional  tax  arrangement.  Also,  the  provisional   tax   registration
threshold  for  individuals  below  the  age  of   65   who   earn   taxable
nonemployment income will be raised from R2Â 000 a year  to  R10Â 000  a  year
from 1 March this year.

Transfer duties

As a further contribution to making home  ownership  affordable,  amendments
to the transfer duty rates are proposed. The new structure is as follows:


  -   On properties with a value of less than R100Â 000,  no  duty  will  be
       paid. [Applause.]


  -   Where the value is between R100Â 000 and R300Â 000, there will be a  5%
       duty.


  -   On a value above R300Â 000, the duty will be 8%.

The average duty on property with a value of R150Â 000 will  fall  from  3,1%
to 1,7%, whereas the duty on property with a value of  R300Â 000  falls  from
4,6% to  3,3%,  thereby  maintaining  an  appropriate  progressive  property
transfer tax. The new rate structure will  apply  to  property  acquisitions
from 1 March this year and will cost R300 million in revenue foregone.

Reducing financial transaction taxes

There are a variety of financial transaction taxes still  in  place  in  our
tax  structure.  In  order  to  contribute  to   the   competitiveness   and
development of our financial sector, it is proposed that  certain  of  these
should be abolished.

With effect from 1 January  2002,  the  2,5%  charge  on  Lloyd's  insurance
premiums will  be  withdrawn.  With  effect  from  1  April,  taxes  on  the
following transactions or financial instruments will be abolished:


  -   repurchase of warrants by their issuers;


  -   the issue of listed debt instruments;


  -   the transfer of a mortgage bond from one institution to another; and


  -   various insurance policies or contracts, and the cession of insurance
       policies.

The overall cost to the fiscus of the transaction tax  withdrawals  is  R130
million.

Indirect tax proposals

Although revenue from value-added tax is expected  to  be  moderately  lower
than budgeted in the present year, it remains a dependable  and  broad-based
tax source. No change in VAT is proposed. [Applause.]

Duties on beverages and tobacco products

Now we come to that sad bit, and amongst the  many  ``Tips  for  Trevor''  a
number have said, ``Please don't call these things sin taxes;  you  make  us
feel bad.'' [Laughter.] Let us rather, then, talk about duties on  beverages
and tobacco products.

Excise taxes have also  lagged  behind  budget  estimates,  reflecting  both
slower than anticipated spending trends and shifts in household  consumption
away from excisable products in  response  to  higher  taxes.  Bearing  both
revenue and health considerations in mind,  the  following  adjustments  are
proposed:


  -   Beer and ciders are raised by 8%, bringing the proposed  excise  duty
       to 43,6 cents per 340 ml can or an average increase of 3,2 cents  per
       can.


  -   Sorghum beer and sorghum flour duties will not be increased. Minister
       Buthelezi must take note. Utshwala! [Sorghum beer!] [Laughter.]


  -   Duties on wine are raised by 8%.


  -   Duties on spirits and sparkling  wine  are  increased  by  10%.  This
       translates into a total excise duty of R11,84 per 750  ml  bottle  of
       spirits, or a R1,08 increase per bottle. [Interjections.]  I  do  not
       know what that ``Yeah, yeah!'' means - too little or too much?


  -   Taxes on tobacco products are raised  by  an  average  of  12%.  This
       increases  the  total  excise  burden  to  R3,51  per  packet  of  20
       cigarettes, or an increase of 34 cents per packet. [Applause.]

We will raise R798 million  with  these  changes.  Government  has  steadily
reduced excise duties on soft  drinks  over  the  last  four  years.  It  is
proposed to abolish the remaining  6  cents  a  litre  duty.  The  estimated
revenue loss will be about R135 million.

Fuel levy

We are mindful of the effect of the depreciation of the rand on pump  prices
and the dependence of our urban public transport system. There  will  be  no
change in the general fuel levy on diesel and  petrol  this  year.  The  tax
burden on fuel has fallen from an average of 45% of the pump price  in  1998
to approximately 30% in the past year.

Environmentally friendly diesel fuels

We are advised that it is now  possible  to  power  a  motor  vehicle  using
crushed sunflower seeds.  Environmentally  friendly  biodiesel  and  ethanol
alternatives have the potential, our advisers tell us, to reduce  dependence
on imported fossil fuels  and  provide  a  growing  market  for  employment-
intensive oil seed crops.

To provide appropriate encouragement to these developments, it  is  proposed
that a levy at 70% of the  general  fuel  levy  rate  should  apply  to  the
consumption of environmentally  friendly  alternative  diesel  fuels.  Other
provisions - the Road Accident Fund levy, off-road  fuel  levy  concessions,
the Sacu excise duty and VAT zero-rating - will apply as for other fuels.

Further maritime diesel fuel concessions

It is proposed to extend the existing full diesel  concessions  to  offshore
vessels conducting research in support of the maritime industry  -  Minister
Moosa should take note - coastal patrol  vessels,  vessel  employed  in  the
servicing of fibre optic  telecommunication  cables  along  our  coastlines,
harbour vessels operated by Portnet and in-port bunker barges. An  estimated
revenue loss of R4,1 million to the fiscus and  R2,4  million  to  the  Road
Accident Fund is envisaged.

Road Accident Fund levy increase

The Road Accident Fund is currently  re-engineering  its  claims  processing
procedures  with  a  view  to   striving   towards   disciplined   financial
management. On the understanding that the fund will continue to improve  its
efficiency and stamp out fraud, the Road Accident Fund levy is increased  by
2 cents a litre so that the fund will receive 18,5 cents on every  litre  of
fuel sold to meet its ongoing liabilities. This  will  raise  an  additional
R310 million and will be effective from 3 April this year.

Addressing tax avoidance and reducing the compliance gap

The overall impact of our tax proposals is to provide tax  relief  of  R15,2
billion. This is possible, in large measure, because of  the  progress  Sars
continues to make in reducing what  we  call  the  ``tax  gap''  -  the  gap
between the revenue that is actually collected and the amount that would  be
raised if compliance with the tax code was complete.  This  gap  arises  for
various  reasons.  In  some  cases  taxpayers  are  not   aware   of   their
obligations. In others, tax is avoided by  aggressive  tax  planning,  while
purportedly adhering to the letter of the law.  Then  there  are  those  who
simply ignore their obligations. An increasing number of people are  finding
that this is a  dangerous  choice.  We  have  a  partnership  with  Minister
Skosana on this particular matter. [Laughter.] The tax gap  is,  of  course,
not only of interest to Sars and the National Treasury. Closing the  gap  is
what makes tax relief and rising social spending possible. Closing  the  gap
allows us to lower the burden on those citizens who meet  their  obligations
and accelerate our investment in meeting the pressing needs of the country.

There are several ways in which we are steadily closing the  gap.  Sars  has
begun the shift to an integrated audit approach,  allowing  the  examination
and comparison of a wide spectrum  of  taxes  in  a  company's  books.  This
improves our  service  to  taxpayers  while  yielding  valuable  comparative
information. By drawing on integrated field audits  and  the  employment  of
highly skilled specialists, the Woodmead project in  Gauteng,  for  example,
has exposed noncompliance in both the formal and  informal  sectors  of  the
business community.

In the banking sector, as announced last year, we have put the spotlight  on
the arrangements and structures  that  lead  to  low  effective  tax  rates.
Improved enforcement of the  current  law  has  already  yielded  additional
collections of  R792  million.  A  review  of  the  taxation  of  derivative
instruments and financial leases will take place in the coming year.

The number of personnel in Sars's Corporate Tax Centre will  double  by  the
middle of this year, contributing both to improved  audit  capacity  and  to
better quality service to corporate businesses. The  role  of  tax  advisers
and consultants in ensuring better compliance and sound advice to  taxpayers
is a further area for review  in  the  year  ahead.  Initiatives  to  extend
compliance to areas of the economy where it is erratic  or  nonexistent  are
being stepped up. As these unfold, Sars will ensure that those who  approach
the Revenue Service voluntarily to meet their obligations will be  met  with
a helpful and sympathetic reception. Those  who  do  not  will  meet  us  in
court.

Details of these and other measures to  streamline  tax  administration  and
address tax avoidance are set out in the Budget Review. Specific  provisions
include:


  -   the introduction of a deeming provision to  underpin  enforcement  of
       the taxation of foreign income  -  people  make  investments  abroad,
       nobody knows what revenue there  is  and  so  we  are  examining  the
       implementation of a deeming provision;


  -   raising the provisional tax threshold from R2Â 000 to R10Â 000;


  -   investigation of the introduction of more  frequent  provisional  tax
       payments; and


  -   the taxation of trusts other than  special  trusts  and  testamentary
       trusts established for the benefit of minor children at a  flat  rate
       of 40%.

Sars's transformation programme, Siyakha,  and  its  technology  improvement
programme,  aim  to  address  the  inadequate  and  outdated   systems   and
technology currently in use and to provide a better quality  of  service  to
all  taxpayers.  These  reforms  will  take  time  before  they  are   fully
effective. In the short term, Sars will be  launching  a  complaints  office
that will operate independently of  branch  offices,  and  small  businesses
will benefit from the  simplification  of  tax  forms  and  more  accessible
contact centres.

As the larger  transformation  gathers  momentum,  we  will  find  that  our
investment in improving tax compliance contributes not  just  to  Government
revenue, but also to improved accounting  and  auditing,  better  governance
and reduced financial risk in the business community at large.

Reinforcing corporate governance

The issue of  corporate  governance  and  in  particular  the  role  of  the
auditing firms has once again dominated the  headlines.  The  Enron  debacle
has brought into sharp relief a number of key issues - weak  or  nonexistent
corporate  governance  structures,   the   fiduciary   responsibilities   of
directors,  negligent  and  sometimes   reckless   management,   ineffective
auditing, the independence of auditors and  conflicts  of  interest  arising
from inadequate separation between auditing and consulting. Closer  to  home
a number of corporate failures -  Macmed,  Leisurenet,  Regal  Treasury  and
Unifer, to name but a few - have raised a similar set  of  issues.  Many  of
these weaknesses were highlighted in the Nel commission's report.

The Minister of Finance has responsibility  for  the  legislation  governing
the audit profession in South Africa. Last  year  the  National  Accountancy
and Consultative Forum presented me with  a  draft  Accountancy  Professions
Bill to replace the existing Public Accountants' and Auditors' Act of  1991.
Having considered  the  draft  legislation  and  taking  account  of  recent
developments both nationally and globally, it is my view that the Bill  does
not go far enough. Over the coming months we will actively engage  with  all
the role-players to ensure that the Bill addresses our  country's  needs  in
this regard.

Financing proposals

After taking account of our spending proposals and revenue estimates,  there
is a budget deficit of R22,7 billion to finance next year, or, as  we  said,
2,1% of GDP.

To  date  total  investment  of  R27  billion  has   been   raised   through
restructuring state assets, mainly from international  equity  partners,  of
which R17 billion has been used to reduce debt. Given the  accelerated  pace
of implementation,  some  R12  billion  from  the  restructuring  of  public
enterprises  is  expected  in  2002-03,   decreasing   the   net   borrowing
requirement to R12,2 billion.

We propose to raise R4 billion in short-term loans next  year,  contributing
further to the liquidity of this market. Net foreign borrowing to the  value
of R16,2 billion is proposed. This will allow domestic long-term debt to  be
reduced by about R11 billion. In effect, we propose to repay R11 billion  in
long-term rand-denominated debt next year.

At the end of 2001-02, the total loan debt will amount  to  R425,1  billion,
or 42,9% of GDP, down from over 48% five years ago.  [Applause.]  Debt  will
steadily decline as a share of GDP to a projected 37,4% by the  year  ending
31 March 2005.

Madam Speaker, allow me firstly to place upon the Table:


  (1) Budget Speech - 20 February 2002 [RP 27-2002].


  (2) Estimate of National Revenue 2002 [RP 22-2002].


  (3) Taxation proposals: Income Tax.


  (4) Taxation proposals in respect of specific excise duties (customs  and
       excise) [tabled at 15:30].


  (5) Division of Revenue Bill [B 5 - 2002].


  (6) Budget Review 2002, including ``Annexure E: Explanatory Memorandum on
       the Division of Revenue Bill'' tabled in terms of  section  10(5)  of
       the Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act, 1997 (Act No 97 of  1997)
       [RP 26-2002].


  (7) Estimates of National Expenditure, 2002 [RP 24-2002].


  (8) Appropriation Bill [B 4 - 2002].

This is not very environmentally friendly, because we have  to  cut  down  a
number of trees to produce what Parliament needs for its oversight.

Conclusion

I would like  to  express  my  sincere  and  profound  appreciation  to  the
following:


  -   President Mbeki, for his leadership and the challenges he puts before
       us, before this House, before our nation and  before  our  continent.
       Siyabulela. [Applause.]


  -   Deputy President Jacob  Zuma  and  all  of  our  Cabinet  colleagues,
       particularly the members of the Ministers' Committee on  the  Budget,
       for  their  support  and  initiative  in  bringing   forward   budget
       suggestions.


  -   Deputy Minister Mandisi ``Sipho'' Mpahlwa, for sharing the duties  we
       carry.


  -    My  ``Team  Finance''  colleagues,  the  MECs  for  finance  in  the
       provincial  executive  councils,  who  have  led  with  courage   and
       professionalism. The provinces are in much better shape than many  in
       South Africa want to believe. [Applause.]

Our task has been greatly  facilitated  by  several  others:  Governor  Tito
Mboweni and his team at the SA Reserve Bank - I do not see him,  but  he  is
somewhere in the gallery ... [Applause] ... Murphy Morobe and  his  team  at
the Financial and Fiscal  Commission,  Philip  Dexter  and  Nedlac,  Barbara
Hogan as chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on  Finance  ...  [Applause]
... and Qedani Mahlangu as chairperson of the Select Committee  on  Finance.
A special word of thanks is due to the many South  Africans  who  took  time
and made the effort to write, fax and e-mail us their  suggestions  for  the
Budget. We actually have tried to accommodate as many of these as  possible.
I am sorry that some of these ideas - such  as  the  abolition  of  personal
income taxes - could not be accommodated. [Laughter.] Apologies also to  the
correspondent who requested that ice-rink tickets should be  zero-rated  for
VAT purposes. [Laughter.] That might do something to get us  into  the  next
Winter Olympics.

The Budget is largely the fruit of the efforts of the National Treasury  and
the Revenue Service. Special thanks  are  due  to  Maria  Ramos  and  Pravin
Gordhan for their leadership and also for their time. [Applause.]

Thanks also to the staff of the Ministry who  tolerate  us  with  such  good
cheer. Last, but not least, guys, thanks for your support, and thanks to  my
sons and the rest of my family for their unwavering support. [Applause.]

This Budget makes an important contribution  to  achieving  a  more  caring,
more compassionate, more prosperous society; a society with the  imagination
to achieve solidarity, freedom from poverty and, of course,  human  dignity;
a society that nurtures  its  children,  that  respects  and  cherishes  its
elderly; a society that draws deeply on its history  and  the  qualities  of
its struggle - resilience, humility, courage, wisdom, tolerance,  assurance,
and an indomitable spirit for life. These values  are  rooted  deep  in  the
psyche of our nation. They guide us now as they guided the great leaders  of
our country. And although we have achieved our liberty, we must continue  to
aspire to and strive for the vision that inspired that great patriot,  Chief
Albert Luthuli, especially when he wrote:


  The task is not finished. South Africa is not yet a home for all her sons
  and daughters. Such a home we wish to  ensure.  From  the  beginning  our
  history has been one of ascending unities, the breaking of tribal, racial
  and creedal barriers. The past cannot hope to have a  life  sustained  by
  itself, wrenched from the whole. There remains before us the building  of
  a new land ... from the ruins of the old narrow groups,  a  synthesis  of
  the rich cultural strains  which  we  have  inherited  ...  The  task  is
  immense.

Those words live on. The challenge is as profound now  as  it  was  then.  I
thank hon members very much for their patience. [Applause.]

Bill, together with the introductory speech and papers tabled,  referred  to
the Portfolio Committee on Finance for consideration and report.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister, I wish to thank you for drawing  attention
to the fact that Parliament does need more money to  improve  its  telephone
service. [Laughter.]

The House adjourned at 15:36.
