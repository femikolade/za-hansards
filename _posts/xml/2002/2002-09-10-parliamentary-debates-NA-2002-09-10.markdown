Mr M RAMGOBIN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -
       (a)  reports that United States President, George Bush, and British
           Prime Minister, Tony Blair, were locked in talks at Camp David
           to plot a strategy against Iraq; and


       (b)  that 11 September 2002 marks the first anniversary of the
           terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre in New York;


  (2) believes that such events lead to human rights abuses against unarmed
       citizens, especially women and children, unnecessary loss of life,
       destruction of property and contribute to turmoil in world markets
       and worsening levels of poverty;


  (3) calls on President Bush and Prime Minister Blair to desist from
       mounting a military campaign and violence against the people of Iraq;
       and


  (4) further calls on the leaders and the peoples of the world to work
       towards a safe and secure world in the knowledge that justice, peace,
       coexistence and stability are vital to restore our constantly bruised
       humanity.
Mr E K MOORCROFT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:

       the United Nations;


  (2) further notes that he will raise a number of issues of international
       importance; and


  (3) calls on him to use the opportunity to seek the support of the United
       Nations in taking steps to persuade the Zimbabwean government to
       observe the human rights of all people in Zimbabwe and to desist from
       its current course which will bring disaster to millions of
       Zimbabweans and will harm the interests of the region and destroy
       Nepad.

Mr E T FERREIRA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with joy that Brazilian police have rescued two South African
       explorers from an uncertain fate at the hands of a tribe deep in the
       Amazon jungle;


  (2) further notes that although the men were not assaulted during
       captivity, they were denied medical attention, despite suffering from
       numerous ailments, and are now recovering in eastern Brazil; and


  (3) thanks the Brazilian police for rescuing the two captured South
       Africans.

Mr S L DITHEBE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the week of 2 to 7 September was South Africa's Music
       Week, celebrated under the clarion call: ``Ek sÃª Mamela, it's our
       Music''


  (2) further notes that the people of South Africa celebrate local music
       every year, which expresses the rich diversity of the cultures of the
       people of South Africa;


  (3) believes that, in celebrating unity in diversity, our people are
       promoting a common cultural heritage and are contributing to efforts
       aimed at building national unity; and

       South Africa's Music Week a resounding success.

[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee kennis dat ek op die volgende
sittingsdag van die Huis namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis kennis neem dat -


  (1) die Rooi Kruis-kinderhospitaal kan voortgaan met 'n projek om onder
       andere die hospitaal se verouderde niereenheid voor die einde van die
       jaar aansienlik op te knap, aangesien die Wes-Kaapse provinsiale
       regering die koste van deurlopende instandhouding van die projek
       goedgekeur het;


  (2) die helfte van die nodige fondse ingesamel is deur 'n Kampsbaaise
       egpaar wie se seun deur die niereenheid gered is, en dat die res van
       die fondse deur die Kinderhospitaaltrust ingesamel is;


  (3) dit 'n bewys is van wat vermag kan word met die samewerking van die
       gemeenskap, en dat dit ook 'n voorbeeld is van 'n suksesvolle staat-
       privaatvennootskap; en


  (4) die Nuwe NP die Rooi Kruis-kinderhospitaal se inisiatief en projekte
       verwelkom en ondersteun.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows.)

[Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House, I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House notes that -
  (1) the Red Cross Children's Hospital can proceed with a project to
       significantly upgrade the hospital's outdated kidney unit before the
       end of the year, amongst other things, as the Western Cape provincial
       government has approved the cost of continuous maintenance of the
       project;


  (2) half the necessary funds were collected by a Camps Bay couple whose
       son was saved by the unit and that the rest of the funds were
       collected by the Children's Hospital Trust;


  (3) this is evidence of what can be achieved with the co-operation of the
       community and that it is also an example of a successful state-
       private partnership; and


  (4) the New NP welcomes and supports the Red Cross Children's Hospital's
       initiative and projects.]

Ms A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House, in the light of the serious and ongoing drug trade and
  increasing level of addiction in South Africa, as well as the violence
  and economic loss associated with it, urges Government to ensure -


  (1) increased and more effective policing of drug trafficking and
       dealing, combined with more effective prosecution;


  (2) more stringent and onerous bail conditions for suspects of illegal
       drug activities, as well as more severe punishment to fit the crime
       when convictions are made;


  (3) increased specialist customs officials and control of unbound cargo
       and luggage at airports and seaports;


  (4) minimum standards for rehabilitation centres and a body to impose and
       regulate such standards, as well as greater funding for the
       rehabilitation of chemical substance dependants;


  (5) the appointment of a judicial  commission of inquiry to investigate
       local and international syndicate involvement in drug trafficking and
       alleged police corruption; and


  (6) the initiation and maintenance of a mass-media awareness and
       education campaign that is tailored for young people, on a regional
       and language-specific basis.

Mr K MOONSAMY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the statement by the General-Secretary of the South African
       Communist Party, Comrade Blade Nzimande, that ``teachers who fall in
       love with pupils must be fired''


  (2) believes that teachers who have a sexual relationship with
       schoolchildren are engaged in child abuse practices and betray the
       trust that parents have bestowed on them as educators and mentors of
       future leaders of our country;
  (3) furthers believes that such practices militate against initiatives by
       Government and civil society towards restoring the moral fibre of our
       society;


  (4) condemns such evil and immoral practices; and


  (5) further calls on communities, pupils and parents to expose this
       barbaric practice wherever and whenever it raises its ugly head.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the cold-blooded murder of Monique Valentine and the
       devastating effect it has had on our communities;


  (2) further notes that children with disabilities are recognised to be
       amongst the most vulnerable in South Africa and that South Africa has
       a population of over 43 million people, of which approximately 17
       million are children, yet the prevalence of crime against them is
       increasing at an alarming rate;


  (3) also notes that if we look through the eyes of children at the
       present portrait reflected from the face of South Africa, and
       specifically the Western Cape, it does not inspire hope for the
       future, but rather a veil of crime and grime too dense to imagine a
       brighter tomorrow;


  (4) calls on Community Safety Minister, Mr Ramatlakane, to act on his
       statement that ``More must be done to protect our children and curb
       crime'', as his actions will speak louder than fruitless words;


  (5) calls on Government to reintroduce the death penalty, so that these
       cold-hearted killers, and all those like them who are capable of
       murdering a defenceless and vulnerable child in cold blood, will see
       that Government means business and that they will not get away with
       their crimes with only a simple smack on the wrist; and


  (6) calls on Government to act now as we must protect our future
       generations at all costs.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Constituency Office of the PAC at Botshabelo in the Free
           State was raided by the police on 23 August 2002;


       (b)  the raid was carried out in a military-style operation in which
           14 police vehicles were used; and


       (c)  the police said they were searching for weapons, computers and
           fax machines, but had no warrant to search this PAC office, and
           at any rate found no weapons because the PAC is a peace-loving
           and nonviolent organisation;
  (2) observes that the PAC has worked harmoniously with the police;


  (3) therefore condemns, in the strongest language, this provocative,
       illegal and unwarranted police raid of the PAC Office; and


  (4) demands that the Minister of Safety and Security investigate this
       provocative act by the police and have those who carried out this
       illegal search punished.

Ms M M SOTYU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the professional execution of duties by the SA Police Service
       during the World Summit on Sustainable Development;


  (2) acknowledges the immensity of the tasks that the country expected the
       SAPS to carry out by ensuring the safety and security of delegates
       and all who took part in the conference; and


  (3) commends this heroic conduct by the SAPS, as it contributed
       immeasurably towards the creation and maintenance of a safe and
       secure South Africa, and towards making our country an international
       destination.

[Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that
on the next sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Jurgen Harksen's attorney stated under oath that Mr
       Harksen gave R100 000 to the ANC;

[Interjections.]


  (2) further notes that the New NP has refused to expose its bank accounts
       to forensic audit; and
[Interjections.]


  (3) therefore calls on the Premier of the Western Cape, Marthinus van
       Schalkwyk, and his Deputy, Ebrahim Rasool, to extend the terms of
       reference of the Desai Commission to investigate what amounts Mr
       Harksen has given to the New NP, the ANC and any other political
       party.

[Interjections.]

Mr M V NGEMA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with great sadness that ten people were killed and five others
       were seriously injured in a collision between a bakkie and a taxi on
       the N2 freeway in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday morning; and


  (2) sends its condolences to the families of the deceased and prays for a
       full and speedy recovery of the injured people.

Dr A N LUTHULI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 9 September was Foetal Alcohol Syndrome Day and that
       Foetal Alcohol Syndrome, a serious condition, is found in babies
       whose mothers drink excessive amounts of alcohol during pregnancy,
       resulting in babies being born with mental and physical disabilities;


  (2) therefore calls on the Government to further intensify its health
       education and health promotion campaigns to inform the public of the
       syndrome, and to discourage excessive use of alcohol, especially
       among pregnant women;


  (3) further calls on the Government to take appropriate legislative
       measures to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the dangers of
       alcohol abuse.

Mnr J W LE ROUX: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee kennis dat ek op die volgende
sittingsdag van die Huis namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die Nuwe NP die SA Polisiediens gelukwens met die jongste
           arrestasie van perlemoensmokkelaars waarby miljoene rand weer
           eens betrokke is;


       (b)  perlemoensmokkelary, wat met bendegeweld en dwelmhandel
           gepaardgaan, lank reeds skokkende afmetings aangeneem het; en


       (c)  navorsers dit eens is dat indien die tempo van perlemoenstropery
           nie nou stopgesit word nie, die bron binne drie jaar totaal
           uitgewis sal wees;


  (2) dit skokkend vind dat terwyl ons 'n wÃªreldberaad oor volhoubare
       benutting aanbied, die owerhede sienderoÃ« toelaat dat hierdie unieke
       bron uitgewis word; en


     3) 'n beroep op die betrokke Minister doen om drastiese stappe te doen
        om hierdie skandalige vernietiging van ons natuurlike erfenis te
        voorkom.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House, I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the New NP congratulates the S A Police Service on the latest
           arrest of abalone smugglers where once again millions of rands
           were involved;


       (b)  abalone smuggling accompanied by gang violence and drug dealing
           has long ago reached alarming proportions; and
       (c)  researchers agree that unless the rate at which abalone is being
           plundered is stopped now, the source will be completely depleted
           within three years;


  (2) finds it shocking that while we are hosting the World Summit on
       Sustainable Development, the authorities are visibly allowing this
       unique source to be depleted; and


  (3) appeals to the Minister concerned to take drastic steps in order to
       prevent this shameful devastation of our natural heritage.]

       (b)  that the professionalism displayed by Government officials, the

  (3) congratulates the Government of the Republic of South Africa, the

       successfully communicating the message to the peoples of the world

       (a)  the vicious and senseless killing of young Monique Valentine on
           the Cape Flats when the school bus in which she was travelling
           was hijacked; and


       (b)  the callous indifference of the hijackers who shot a
           defenceless, physically disabled child;


  (2) sends its condolences to Monique's family and her classmates at the

  MORAL REGENERATION: A CALL ON SOUTH AFRICANS TO WORK TOGETHER TO RESTORE
                              THE SOCIAL FABRIC

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker and hon members, it is once again a
pleasure for me to participate in a discussion on moral regeneration in
this House, given the significance of this process in our country.

This debate indicates the seriousness that this House affords to the issue
of moral renewal as part of nation-building in our country. This
interaction is important as we live in an era of globalisation
characterised by fast-paced change, bringing with it both positive and
negative influences. The changes create uncertainty and unease about the
present and the future, and provide yet another challenge for us, as a
nation, in promoting good values.

We have only recently emerged from the apartheid era where the violation of
human rights and freedoms was a norm. In building a new nation, we
therefore need to inculcate a new culture and values.

In addition, Africa is also engaged in a process of renewal through the New
Partnership for Africa's Development, known as Nepad. We view the moral
regeneration process as being intertwined with the fundamental Nepad
principles of good economic and political governance, entrenchment of
democracy, and respect for human rights and ensuring peace and stability.

As a nation, we are pleased to be making our contribution to the success of
Nepad in various ways, including through the moral regeneration process.
The Moral Regeneration Movement seeks to entrench the values that are
enshrined in our Constitution, the Constitutive Act of the African Union
and in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various
other progressive international conventions. These give us a framework and
a solid foundation.

Hon members will recall that on 14 November last year in this House, we
called for a moral regeneration summit to address the problem of moral
decay in our country. This was also against the background of the gruesome
molestation of baby Tshepang in the Northern Cape and similar occurrences
throughout the country. The perpetrator of the baby Tshepang attack has
been sentenced to life plus 18 years in prison.

The successful conclusion of this case indicates yet another success of our
criminal justice system, and showed what we can achieve through
partnerships between the police and communities in the fight against crime.

Hon members will also remember that there was a strong feeling, at the time
of our debate last year, that we needed urgently to confront the
manifestations of moral decay in our midst head-on. These include, amongst
other things; crime and corruption, and the brazen breaking of the law; the
lack of respect for the sanctity of human life and for the next person; the
abuse of women, children and the elderly; the breakdown of parental control
over children and the abuse of alcohol and drugs.

Subsequently, over 1 000 representatives of Government, Parliament and
nongovernmental organisations gathered in Pretoria on 18 April to establish
the Moral Regeneration Movement. I must thank hon members for their
participation in large numbers at that summit. It indicated the deep-seated
concern of this House about matters of national importance.

The launch has been followed by a period of structural development and
networking at all levels. The Moral Regeneration Movement's working
committee, appointed in November 2001, has been considerably enlarged to
include members of provincial Moral Regeneration Movement committees,
political parties and other sectors of civil society.

The establishment of Moral Regeneration Movement committees in most
provinces, as well as some municipalities and metros, indicates that the
Moral Regeneration Movement is taking root at every level. We are also
pleased at the manner in which the campaign has captured the imagination of
many sectors, from the religious sector, business sector, women's
organisations, youth organisations to schools and institutions of higher
learning. The strong focus on Moral Regeneration Movement activities during
Youth Month was especially encouraging, as the active participation of the
youth in the campaign augurs well for its sustainability.

The Western Cape province held a moral regeneration summit on 20 August
while other provinces have held consultative forums. In addition, religious
parliaments were convened in the Northern Cape in May and in the Eastern
Cape in July. However, it is important to note that the Moral Regeneration
Movement is multisectoral, and not confined to the religious sector only.

Through the launch of the Moral Regeneration Movement, we have laid the
foundation and established a vehicle for the promotion of good values in
our society. However, a lot of hard work lies ahead, in the implementation,
and this requires each of us to lend a hand in the true spirit of
volunteerism and Vukuzenzele.

The Constitution of our country best outlines our values such as freedom,
equality, human dignity, responsibility, accountability, respect and
tolerance. We need to promote these values in our homes, communities,
places of work, schools, places of worship and everywhere else.

I must also reiterate the necessity of strengthening the family structure.
The institution of the family is an important entity for nurturing values,
attitudes and behaviour. If we restore the values of respect, honesty,
responsibility, integrity, care and support within families, and clearly
demarcate the lines between right and wrong to our children, we will be
making inroads in dealing with the moral regeneration of our society.

There is a tendency to direct the fight against corruption and moral decay
primarily at communities and the public sector. We must, however, note that
this year has been marked by a number of major corruption scandals in the
corporate sector, both locally and abroad. This happens because we are all
part of the same globe and contaminate each other. No sector is immune, and
this further underlines the need for this campaign.

The corporate sector revelations have indicated shocking deficiencies in
corporate governance, and the inclination towards the elevation of the
profit motive above all other ethical and social responsibilities.

As part of the continental renewal, Africa has undertaken to ensure good
and clean economic governance within the Nepad framework, and we need to
deliver on this mission. The King Reports on Corporate Governance provide a
solid framework in this regard.

We must also emphasise the positive influence of good role models in our
society to provide the necessary leadership, especially to the youth. I
must single out musicians such as Hugh Masekela and Tshepo Tshola who are
working tirelessly in a campaign against substance abuse in the
entertainment industry. They need our support and encouragement in their
good work.

To assist such campaigns, plans are under way for the development of a
national moral charter. The charter will represent a crystallisation of the
central tenets of the various charters, ranging from the King Reports on
Corporate Governance to the various codes of conduct in the public and
private sectors.

It will be a concise pledge, which will contain the essence of core good
values and ethics we would all want to adhere to, and would be prepared to
be judged against. We will release details of the campaign for the citizens
of the country to participate in the drawing up of the charter in the next
month.

Hon members will recall that our President launched the Freedom Park
Heritage Site on 16 June this year. The site is a celebration of our
history and the sacrifices of people who fought for the time-honoured
values that are enshrined in our Constitution. It also serves as a powerful
reminder of what we have achieved against all odds, as we move forward to
rebuild our country. These are the memories which should provide us with
the courage to build a better society and a better country. We need to
continue working tirelessly to play our role in entrenching good values and
behaviour. We must volunteer our time and offer our services to
neighbourhood schools, hospitals and clinics, to assist the elderly, sick
and vulnerable, and through taking decisive action against crime and
corruption.

Once we have succeeded in building a truly caring nation with sound values
and a solid foundation, we will have enhanced our freedom and democracy,
and will better appreciate what these values mean.

It is important that, as public representatives, we play a leading role in
the moral regeneration process. I trust that, during this debate, hon
members from all political parties will share with us information on
programmes that are in place or are being set up in their constituencies to
ensure that this renewal becomes a reality in every corner of our country.
It is when we all lend a hand that we will be able to see positive results.

I would like to reiterate that this is everyone's campaign, irrespective of
political affiliation and any other beliefs. It is a campaign for all South
Africans.

What we must be conscious of is that we have begun the journey. Together,
and side by side, with unwavering determination and commitment, we must
walk this challenging road until we achieve a truly caring society with
unshakeable foundations. [Applause.]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: ``We live in a sick society. Let us diagnose the sickness
and then cure it.'' These were the words of the Deputy President during an
interview earlier this year, just before the Moral Regeneration Summit.

Tot 'n groot mate wil ek met die Adjunkpresident saamstem, alhoewel ek van
mening is dat ons gemeenskap nie net gewoonweg siek is nie, maar dodelik
siek is. [To a large extent I want to agree with the Deputy President,
although I am of the opinion that we are not just plain sick, but
terminally ill.]

The brutal killing of Monique Valentine, the mentally handicapped girl from
Blue Downs, left us all very sad and hurting. However, what grieved me the
most over the last few days was the brutal arrogance with which one of the
attackers gave the ``up yours'' sign after the brutal attack in the Peddie
Area on Michelle Cocks and her friend, Isla Grundy.

The message of this misguided and totally confused individual was loud and
clear: Up yours to the victims! Up yours to the lawmakers! Up yours to
those who must enforce the law, the police, the judiciary and correctional
services! Up yours to the community at large! Up yours in the name of human
rights and freedom of expression! Therefore my submission, that our society
is not just sick, but terminally ill.

Because of this attack, Michelle Cocks lost her unborn baby. For most of us
this cannot be too serious, because not so long ago a law was passed in
this House which legalised the killing of unborn babies, and we kill them
by the thousands - almost 300 000 since February 1997, in the name of
freedom of choice. [Interjections.]

During that same interview, when asked about the death penalty, the Deputy
President responded: ``We cannot take away a life, because it is a gift of
God.'' As a creationist, I agree. I believe life comes from God and man was
created in the image of God for a specific purpose. I do not believe that I
evolved from a chimpanzee and that the Sterkfontein Caves represent the
cradle of my forefathers. If some members of this House are passionate
about their forefathers in the zoo, I am not.

Baie lede glo soos ek, maar ons sit terug terwyl ons swyg of het klakkelose
napraters geword, ter wille van politieke korrektheid. [A lot of members
believe as I do, but we are sitting back while remaining silent, or we have
become senseless parrots for the sake of political correctness.]

No wonder Mondi Makhanya, in an article called ``Biko's message is more
urgent than ever'', asks the following:


  What is it in us as a nation that makes us accept the unacceptable and
  defend the indefensible?

The sickness is in our minds. Sick minds produce sick ideas and sick ideas
lead to sick actions. So if we want to change our society for the better,
we have to change the way in which people think.

Die grootste uitvoerproduk van ons tyd is idees. In die hoogs tegnologiese
wÃªreld waarin ons leef, word idees binne sekondes van een deel van die
wÃªreld na 'n ander uitgevoer, te koop aangebied en almal gryp net. Niemand
vra meer vrae nie.

Om te verskil en 'n ander mening te hÃª en uit te spreek, het 'n doodsonde
geword. Daarom ook die uitdaging deur die agb Adjunkpresident in dieselfde
onderhoud aan die kerkgemeenskap. Waarom bly die kerk stil? Waarom daag die
kerk nie die status quo uit as wetgewing in die Parlement deurgevoer word,
wat die kerk as immoreel beskou nie? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[The biggest export product of our time is ideas. In the extremely
technological world we live in ideas are exported within seconds from one
part of the world to another, are offered for sale and everyone just grabs.
Nobody asks questions any more.

To differ and to have a different opinion and express it has become a
mortal sin. Hence also the hon Deputy President's challenge, in the same
interview, to the church community. Why does the church remain silent? Why
doesn't the church challenge the status quo when legislation which the
church might regard as immoral is being passed by Parliament?]

The battle is for the mind.

Steve Biko het die swart bewussynsfilosofie gepropageer. Sommige mense
plaas die klem op Swart; ek plaas die klem op Bewussyn. Na my mening gaan
diÃ© filosofie oor die bewusmaking van menswaardigheid, selfrespek en trots.
Dit is lewensbeskouings wat nodig is om ons positief te maak oor die lewe
en ons verhouding met ander mense en ons omgewing - en dit beteken nie die
aarde is my ma nie! (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Steve Biko propagated the Black Consciousness philosophy. Some people
place the emphasis on ``Black''; I place it on ``Consciousness''. To my
mind this philosophy is about making people aware of human dignity, self
respect and pride. These are outlooks on life that are needed to make us
positive about life and our relationship with other people and our
environment - and this does not mean that the earth is my mother!]

The basic set of presuppositions making up my world view, that forms the
basis of my values and norms, comes down to three questions: firstly,
concerning the existence or nonexistence of God; secondly the position of
humankind in the universe and thirdly, the nature of the universe itself.

Where do I come from? How do I know? What is of ultimate value? Where am I
going? Questions of origin, of knowledge, of value, of destiny. These are
difficult questions, especially for us who live in a world of shadows and
mirrors and spindoctors. But these are vital questions.

A well-known scientist once shouted: ``Eureka, I have found it!'' It is my
prayer that all of us will receive revelationary knowledge to assist us in
answering these questions so that each one of us can make our contribution
in turning the tide. [Applause.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Somlomo, mhlonishwa Phini likaMongameli [Hon Speaker,
hon Deputy President ...]

When my party asked me to participate in the debate about moral
regeneration, the topic, which had up to that time appeared to be an
ordinary topic, took on a new dimension.

It immediately dawned on me that here we are dealing with a very serious
debate, namely the restoration of the social fabric. The dictionary defines
the word ``restore'' as bringing back into existence or use, bringing back
or putting back into a former or original state. If we were to accept this
definition, many questions do arise.

Let me submit that action by an individual - any individual - or a group of
individuals needs to be guided by ideas. The first question, therefore, is
to ask: What ideas? Whose ideas?

If we look at traditional societies, we find that the primary aim of
education was the development of a loveable, beautiful, respectable and
responsible individual.

The second aim of education was to develop a skilful individual. But, with
the passage of time, the first aim of education, that of developing a
respectable individual, was jettisoned and the second aim received the most
emphasis at the expense of the first. The result was the development of a
mechanical individual. This happened through the process of dehumanisation.

If we want to restore the fabric of our society, the first thing we
therefore have to do is to end the conditions of dehumanisation, which
manifest themselves in the following forms: the rejecting and despising of
one's language, the rejection of one's customs and one's past and the
rejection of one's colour.

So there you are. The first step towards moral regeneration, in other
words, is to restore and accept that we Africans have our own ideas which
tell us how to live life itself. In other words, that is to say, we have
our own philosophy, namely ubuntu-botho.

Of course, I know that among us in the Chamber there are those who argue
that to talk on African philosophy and culture is to talk about
anachronisms - something that is outdated. Yes, we admit that various
thoughts and practices can be anachronistic and must be either discarded or
modified. But the whole society cannot be discarded.

We must, as a matter of urgency, explore the ubuntu-botho ideas on
morality. It is fruitless to talk about moral regeneration in vague and
general terms. Sometimes I find it very distressing to see Africans being
shy and apologetic to talk about that which defines their very essence, the
ubuntu-botho philosophy.

We have to remember, together with Lenin, that during the time of a
revolution, many things both good and evil do happen. Lenin said that a
true revolutionary is one who has the courage to point out evil things that
may have happened during a revolution.

We must tell the younger generation that disrespect for authority might
have been useful during the struggle, but not now. Let us tell them about
all those things which were evil, but expedient, during the struggle. I do
not think that we have been honest enough with our youth.

The saying that we are masters of our own destiny is very true when it
comes to the influence of the electronic media. When one looks at some of
our TV programmes, one's mind boggles. Take the Yizo Yizo programme, take
the Phat Joe programme, or some of the love Life programmes. Then one asks:
Are we serious about moral regeneration?

Malcolm X lamented the fact that things did not go well for the African-
Americans, because their actions were written in the wrong currency. We too
are making no visible dents in moral regeneration, because - let me suggest
- our actions are written in the wrong currency, hence they bounce.
[Applause.]

Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, and hon
members, today's debate is about issues which are very close to my heart.
Like other speakers, I would like to approach this debate by looking at our
historical background, because it would be morally wrong not to remember
where we come from.

The formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, which institutionalised
racism in South Africa, had more far-reaching consequences than what the
architects of the union envisaged. What this meant was that some people
were less human than others. This happened simply because the aggressors
did not understand the lifestyles of the local people.
Last year our country was given a chance by the United Nations to host a
very important conference on racism. This was not by mistake. It happened
because South Africa qualified to host this conference, because of the
healing process that we have embarked on as a nation. The outcome of the
conference was very positive and very clear: that there is only one race -
a human race. No matter what colour or creed, we are faced with the same
social problems. As the Bible says, we are all created in God's image.

Two weeks ago we saw another conference in South Africa, on sustainable
development. The question is: Can we sustain development without good
morals? Morality is the foundation for sustaining human beings, families,
societies and the nation as a whole.

In 1994 we had a very important programme, the Reconstruction and
Development Programme. But, if members remember, when we identified the
social problems that we had, the former President made a statement saying
that we needed an RDP of the soul.

I just want to remind hon members who were young in the early Seventies.
There was a very lovely song sung by one family, namely the Staple family.
In the song, Mavis Staple was asking: Are you sure it is not your concern
to see your neighbour's house is on fire? Are you sure it would be a waste
of time for you to show someone who has lost their way the direction?''
Today we are discussing this moral regeneration because we accept that
there is something wrong and, therefore, it is important for us to start
acting. It is important for us to know our past, to change the present and
to ensure that our future is bright for our children.

Our country has a very progressive Constitution, and in this Constitution
we find the Bill of Rights. This Bill of Rights affirms the democratic
values of all our people. I tried to read the Bill of Rights, because when
I read the law, I use my finger for reading. When I read this, I tried to
find a passage which would set individual rights above the rights of
others, and there was nothing. In this analogy, I realised it was immoral
to protect selfishness through the Constitution and all other ways that can
be used. If we take this analogy, we will realise that selfishness, greed,
and self-centredness are what drive many people to go astray. It is more
because of personal interests that any other reason.

In religion we learn that God is concerned about all, not about
individuals. In our cultures, especially if we are to unpack botho, as hon
Mpontshane put it, it is concerned about the purpose of the whole, not
about individuals. Therefore, I do not find contradictions between our
cultures and religion on this matter, because they are concerned about the
whole. Therefore, I want to put it very clearly that if we are concerned
about God let us not use Him for our selfish purposes, because the nature
of God is not of serving self-interests.

Allow me to share my experience of the lovely puppies that my sister had.
She had two beautiful dogs which were growing up without having puppies. We
were getting worried that they were beautiful, yet we could not get puppies
from them. But we realised very late that these dogs respect natural laws.
They knew they were a brother and a sister, therefore they were not mating.
It is very disturbing to see that human beings have fallen below the animal
kingdom. Human beings do not respect natural laws, never mind the laws that
we pass in this Parliament.
Therefore I think it was correct for the Department of Justice and
Constitutional Development to give those aggressors life imprisonment,
because they are not worth living with human beings. I am saying this in
the case of baby Tshepang, because how could the children trust us, and how
could we explain to this child what had happened to her when she grows up?
Therefore, I think that as this House we have many challenges, because as
parliamentarians we have taken an oath. My understanding of this oath is
that we are responsible for cleaning up this society. We must live by
example, as the Deputy President has said.

Last weekend I had the chance of interacting with the religious community,
and I must say that the outcome of that meeting is very important. Rev
Ghomsi and his wife agreed in that workshop that we should be able to
promote the concept of peace ambassadors. In other words, we should be
examples ourselves. We will work at provincial level with MPLs and
councillors, and ensure that we promote good values in whatever we are
doing. We, ourselves, should live by example.

The principles underlining this are that we want to strengthen marriage and
family, promote moral education for the youth, and have programmes to
overcome racial, national, cultural and religious barriers. We think that,
through dialogue, this is possible.

of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[Today I have spoken in a foreign language. Before I resume my seat, may I
remind our people that in Sepedi we say, ``tloga tloga e tloga kgale,
modisa wa kgomo o tswa natso sakeng'' (the early bird catches the fattest
worm). In IsiZulu they say `` lugotshwa lusemanzi''. So, as parents we have
the responsibility to educate our children so that they should know the
truth as they grow. I do not understand why we are scared of our children
by not telling them the truth. Is it because we are not their real role
models? Perhaps our behaviour is not up to standard. It is true that when a
child has seen some immoral behaviour from his or her parent or parents one
cannot correct him or her. In this regard I want us to ask our nation to
continue developing itself.

Today our Government has erected many community halls, rather than the
liquor stores built by the apartheid government. Therefore, we should
utilise those community halls so that there may be life in our communities,
and our people must also consult one another and build one another up so
that our country can be safe. [Applause.]]
Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, in one of her books, Ayn Rand describes how
Attila the Hun and the witchdoctors have, over the ages, conspired to
oppress people; Attila being government or the warlord and the witches
describing the role of the churches.

The history of Africa is chequered with the collusion of European
governments and European churches, working together to subjugate our people
under the auspices of spreading the gospel and bringing civilisation to the
savages of Africa.

It is common knowledge what hardships and inhumane treatment colonialism
has brought to Africa. Morality is influenced by the social reality that
communities experience. At the heart of moral regeneration is the idea of
morality. Our past as Africans was much more than just the denial of
political rights and ownership.

Colonialism and apartheid denied us, as Africans, our basic human rights.
The organs of state and church were used to dehumanise us. Once proud
African warriors were reduced to male servants and childminders. Farmers
left their lands and had to go to cities, far away from their families, to
scrape for a living, as they existed far below the breadline. Alienation
took place at different levels, first, between Africans and Europeans, but
also amongst Africans.

Our own society was determined by our adherence to European values and also
by our physical resemblance to Europeans. Africans with skin colour or hair
texture resembling Europeans' were thought to be more intelligent and had
access to better-paying jobs, which led to further division amongst us. We
became the objects of our own oppression, the gatekeepers of colonial
masters.

The moral assault on the majority of Africans has made it necessary for us
to honestly re-examine our value systems. We need to recreate a shared
value system in a country where certain political parties gave their small
band of racist supporters hope by claiming that Aids will eventually kill
off blacks and they would then establish a supremacist, elitist white
government.

The battle for the creation and maintenance of shared values for our
society is a long-term challenge and must urgently be dealt with. We came
from a deeply divided past as South Africans and we need to unite and work
towards the development of a shared future, a vision of a united nation
which shares the noble ideas enshrined in our Constitution.

We must heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on
democratic values and fundamental human rights. We must not only demand of
Government to respect our rights. There is an obligation on every one of us
in this country to respect the rights of their fellow human beings, black
and white, men and women, young and old.

The manner in which we managed to prevent a bloody civil war, by
negotiating a peaceful settlement, and the fact that there are no large-
scale racial conflicts in our country, says that we have the ability to
heal the wounds of the past and build a future on the foundations of
morality and respect for each other.

Our past was no accident. Our oppression was planned in Europe. A total
onslaught on Africa's people, and its resources was planned and executed by
the European states, businesses and church. What we need is a renaissance
of morality. We must denounce immorality as a nation. We must search in our
own history; ubuntu characterises our value system as Africans. These
values have kept us sane and compassionate during our very inhumane and
cruel history. We need to build a new way of life: a society that rejects
crime, violence and corruption, a society that will, as a matter of
urgency, address the needs of the most vulnerable members of our society.

Religious institutions must acknowledge their role during colonialism and
apartheid and, also, their silence when they had to speak out and act. They
must never forget the awful things to which they were partners. In
remembering their transgressions, they should be motivated to assist us, as
a nation, to re-establish these values that will lead to moral
regeneration.

The African family has always been a source of strength and support. It has
been the place where we were taught compassion, where we were taught values
based on compassion and respect for ourselves, each other and the community
at large.

Unfortunately, migrant labour and other practices of our past have
destroyed more families. A process led by the Department of Social
Development is under way to develop a family policy. The department could
also benefit from examining the best practices internationally. The
government of New Zealand has an inter-ministerial committee on
strengthening families and there is the US-based fragile family project, as
examples that can be used.

There are projects designed to strengthen dysfunctional families. They
could also consider funding nongovernmental institutions that can provide
appropriate care, keep fathers, who are absent because of divorce or
separation, in touch with their children, and other such innovative
projects in response to the maladies associated with broken families.

A pilot flagship project could be used to replicate the US-based fragile
family initiative in South Africa. Apart from the need to address the
problems connected to dysfunctional families, the challenge of developing
functional families and other social institutions that are geared to
contribute towards generating citizens that can be standard-bearers of the
rights enshrined in the Constitution, still remains.

The final two decades of the struggle for democratic rule led to profound
changes in the communities. Members of the communities were challenging the
authority of community leaders, particularly young members who felt that
they were not confronting the system aggressively enough. A negative view
developed towards most structures of authority, from the police to
traditional leaders, to community leaders and even to heads of families.
Into this authority vacuum, which was only partially filled by different
levels of political leadership, drifted a range of negative subcultures.

In some communities, negative subcultures have been actively propagated
over a period of decades. Social groupings, such as gangs, adopted power
and authority within such communities and unleashed a negative morality
close to a decade after the advent of the new democracy. The new Government
is still dealing with these legacies.

It is a fact that these organised communities without a clear system of
authority, ethics of responsibility and mechanisms of accountability,
provide opportunities for crime. Negative subcultures that arise in the
midst of this disorganisation and economic inequity provide ideologies for
crime, and entrenched substance abuse provides a catalyst for crime.
[Interjections.]
The old criminal justice system was inadequate to rehabilitate offenders,
to ensure their reintegration into socially constructive community life and
to prevent further sustained cycles of crime, therefore programmes to
rediscover community values and to emphasise the positive aspect of these
values, need to be located within the nodal structure of the Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Strategy and the Urban Renewal  Strategy.

The Department of Provincial and Local Government, assisted by the
departments involved in social crime prevention, should be the appropriate
location for such a programme. The involvement of civic, traditional and
religious leaders should be critical too.

Mr S ABRAM: Mr Chairperson, the Moral Regeneration Summit recognised a
number of urgent issues that need addressing. These include the lack of
respect for the sanctity of life; the breakdown of parental control of
children in families; the lack of respect for authority, seen through the
brazen breaking of the law and total disregard for rules and regulations;
the abuse of alcohol and drugs; the abuse of women and children and other
vulnerable members of society; and the general blurring of the lines
between right and wrong.

The hon Deputy President, in his address at the launch, highlighted the
need for discussions to focus on the weakening of the family and the
changing nature of the family. He recognised that this has contributed to
the breakdown of the moral fibre in society.

In support of this statement, he stated that in 1995, 42% of children under
the age of seven years were living only with their mothers. Data from the
1996 census further revealed that over 333 000 had untraceable fathers,
over 24 000 had untraceable mothers and approximately 99 000 households
were headed by children aged from 10 to 17 years of age.

The number of child-headed households is likely to have increased since,
due to HIV and Aids. This discourse will briefly consider the role of the
family in the teaching of morals as well as look at Parliament and its
relationship to the family.

Psychologists such as Eric Ericsson saw the first year of life as an
important time, when infants develop a feeling of basic trust or mistrust
about the world. According to his theory, there are eight stages of
lifelong psychological development, which starts with infancy. Children
also learn to make choices and control themselves within the second year.
Ericsson states that during the formative years it is up to the parents to
channel the child's impulses into socially acceptable outlets.

The process through which parents and, therefore, the family as well as
others in authority channel children's impulses and teach them skills and
rules needed to function in society, is called socialisation. Cultural
values and environmental conditions shape this process.

Parenting styles also influence the child's social and emotional
development. Baumriud distinguishes between three parenting or
socialisation styles. These are: firstly, the authoritarian parents, who
are strict, punitive and unsympathetic - they value obedience and do not
encourage independence; secondly, the permissive parents, whose discipline
is lax and whose children have complete freedom. Then there are
authoritative parents, who reason with their children and encourage give
and take.

It was observed that authoritarian parents had children who were
unfriendly, distrustful and withdrawn. The children of permissive parents
were immature, dependent and unhappy. Children of authoritative parents
were friendly, co-operative, self-reliant and socially responsible.

Psychologists such as Colberg have also considered the question of
morality. In this regard, research by Colberg has found that the reasons
given for moral choices change systematically and consistently with age.
Young children would make moral judgments that are different from those of
older children, adolescents or adults. For example, it would be typical of
children under the age of nine to make moral judgments which tend to be
selfish in nature.

Encouraging children and adolescents to higher levels of reasoning can
assist in encouraging moral behaviour. However, the development of moral
behaviour involves more than abstract knowledge. Real experiences in
solving real moral problems also have an impact on development. Children
and adolescents need to see consistent models of moral reasoning and
behaviour in the actions of their parents, siblings and peers, to encourage
moral development. Children and adolescents further need parents to promote
moral behaviour through authoritative socialisation.

As seen from the above, parents and families play an important role in
socialisation. However, as indicated by Colberg, for children and
adolescents to develop higher levels of moral reasoning and moral
behaviour, parents need to be consistent and positive role models.

So, whilst the family can be an institution of positive role modelling and
moral development, it can also be reasoned that the family is a place where
dysfunctional children, adolescents and adults can be developed. [Time

us a chance to have a debate on moral regeneration in the country as a

We should not run away from the fact that apartheid played a significant
role in tarnishing people's morals in this country.]

While the cause of moral degeneration can be traced back to political and
economic factors, on the other hand, social and structural imperatives
cannot be ignored. The latter could have contributed through the
institutionalisation of essential commodities such as land, division of
labour, ownership of the means of production, distribution of wealth and
income, infrastructure, credit facilities, educational and health
facilities and advisory services. The former, because of its intricate
linkages to the latter, could have contributed to the dislocation of
conventional and traditional family structures as well as social values and
norms.

[Industries were built in urban areas far away from homes. Consequently it
was necessary that husbands leave their wives and children all alone with
nobody looking after them. The construction of hostels was the main cause
of family separations, because it was only men who had the right to work
while women were not allowed and also they were not allowed to put their
foot in the hostels.

As the time went on women were allowed to work. On top of that, they were
exploited by not getting paid as much as men did although they were doing
the same job. Employers also played a role in tarnishing people's morals by
forcing them to work extra hours. This divided families, and one often
finds that parents cannot live with their children anymore. And the other
thing is the disrespect that is now prevalent in the communities. There are
those that when they see a woman they see a rape or a hitting object. We
should know that women are part of the nation, therefore they deserve
respect.

The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development has also shown
that these hooligans who are rapists do not deserve to be part of the
community, by sentencing a rapist to life few days ago.]

I also want to say that prescription of the correct cure is dependent on a
rigorous analysis of the reality. On the moral regeneration issue, the
reality confronting the nation may be classified as follows: the rapid
disintegration of the social fabric with its concomitant consequences, such
as abuse of children and the elderly, rampant violence and crime, neglect
of the sick and the destitute, and the breaking down of family and society
values and norms.

In an effort to rally the nation around this common challenge, the
President in this year's state of the nation address cautioned South
African citizens that moral regeneration means inculcating in us and the
youth service to the people. Selfless commitment to the common good is more
valuable than selfish pursuit of material rewards. Productive investment is
more valuable than aimless gambling in markets for derivatives. Payment for
honest work is more fulfilling and sustainable than theft. Children and
women are there to be respected, not to become targets of abuse.

This cautionary note not only seems to reinforce a call for nation-
building, but also evokes an urgent need to revisit the values enshrined in
the country's Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I will mention just a
few of these rights: the right to life and personal security, the right to
freedom from hunger and poverty and the right to equality of gender.

We need to outline the contribution of the mass media, particularly the
electronic media, in promoting moral degeneration or regeneration, and come
with proposals on how to deal with challenges upon and ahead of us on moral
regeneration.

The electronic media, specifically radio and television, if properly
utilised, can serve as the most vital instrument, not only to change the
attitudes and mould the values of society, but also for development and
moral regeneration.
Basekhona-ke abasebenzisa ulimi olunodlame. Thina kule Ndlu komele
siqinisekise ukuthi asiyona ingxenye yalabo abasadla ngoludala. Nokho futhi
likhona iqhaza elibanjwa ngezokusakaza ngokuhlunyeleliswa kwezimilo
nangokubuyisa isithunzi somunutu wase-Afrika, isibonelo: Ngomhla ka-9
Agasti okwakuwusuku lomama, kwavezwa umdlalo othi, -``Neria'' owawubonisa
ukuthi abesifazane bahlukunyezwa kanjani uma befelwe abayeni babo, kanti
futhi wabonisa ukuthi kumele bawalwele kanjuani amalungelo abo.

Bakwethu, kuhle sisho ngazwi linye sithi: UKhongolose uyibekile induku
ebandla ngokuvuselela ukuhlunyeleliswa kwezimilo kanye nesithunzi somuntu
wase-Afrika, ikakhulukazi abesifazane.

Uma singase sibheke, ngubani owayazi ukuthi umzimba ka-Sarah Baartman
ungabuyiswa emazweni, agcine esebekwe endlini yakhe yokugcina ngesizotha,
ngaphandle kukaHulumeni oholwa nguKhongolose?

Namhlanje sinekomidi elibhekene nemithetho eshaywa kule Ndlu ukuthi yona
ngabe ayicwasi yini ngokobulili nanokuthi abesifazane ngabe bayawazi yini
amalungelo abo nokuthi bayafundiswa yini ngawo. Ngisho lapha ikomidi le-
Improvenment of Life and Status of Women.  Sinesigungu ngaphansi komNyango
wezaseKhaya esicwaninga ngamafilimu ukuthi ngabe afanele yini ukuvezwa
kumabonakude noma qha. Leyo-ke yi-Film and Publications Board.

Sengigcina, kuzomele sisebenze kanzima nangokuzimisela nokuzinikela ukwakha
isizwe esiyiso nesizihloniphayo, ikakhulukazi ekuvuseleleni imindeni yethu
ngothando ukuze abantwana bethu bakhule ngobuqotho nangenhlonipho.
Asingafani-ke ne-DP sibe yiziphungumangatha zona ezingazi ukuthi zisuka
kuphi ziya kuphi; ushilo umhlonishwa u-Opperman.

Thina njengabantu besifazane kufanele sibambe iqhaza lokwakha lesi sizwe,
ikakhulukazi kubantwana bethu. Ngonyaka ka-1956 sakwazi ukulwisana
nokuphathwa kwamabhasi saphumelela ngoba sasibambisene. Yini-ke engasehlula
namhlanje? Ngisho incwadi engcwele iyasivumela, ithi: Umfazi
ohlakaniphileyo uyayakha indlu yakhe, kepha oyisiwula uyayibhidliza
ngezandla zakhe.

Sisonke sibambisene siyophumelela. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs

[There are those who still use violent language. We in this House should
make sure that we are not part of those who are still using an old system.
However, the media is also playing a role by talking about moral
regeneration and dignity restoration of an African. For example, on August
9 which was Women's Day, a drama called ``Neria,'' was shown on TV which
showed how women are abused when their husbands have died. It also showed
how they should fight for their rights. Hon members, we must say in one
voice that the ANC has made a profound contribution towards the moral
regeneration and restoration of dignity of an African, women in particular.

If we could just think for a moment, who would have thought that Sarah
Bartman's body could be brought back from abroad, and ultimately be put in
her final resting place in a dignified manner if it were not for the ANC-
led Government?

Today we have a committee which looks into laws that are made in this House
to see whether they do not discriminate in terms of gender and that women
know their rights and also that they are taught about them. I am talking
about the Improvement of Life Status of Women committee. We have a council
under the auspices of the Department of Home Affairs which examines films
to see whether they should be shown on television or not, and it is called
the Film and Publications Board.

In conclusion, we must work hard, with determination and dedication in
order to build a true nation that has self-respect, particularly in
reviving our families with love so that our children grow up with sincerity
and respect. Let us not be like the DP and become chrysalises who do not
know where they come from and where they are going to; so said hon
Opperman.

We as women should play a role in building this nation, our children in
particular. In 1956 we were able to fight against pass laws and we
succeeded because we were one. So what can stand in our way today? Even the
Holy Book agrees with us. It says that a wise woman builds her house, but a
stupid one destroys it with her own hands.

By all of us working together we will succeed.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson and Deputy President, moral regeneration sounds
good, but what exactly do we mean? Biblical morality, for example, is
diametrically opposed to the morality which is diligently promoted in South
Africa.

Humanism now dictates the new South African and new world order. This new
order does not seek to restrain and punish evil and to protect good, but
seeks to change and reform mankind through laws and policies which, they
say, will free us from every evil. The Equality Act, for example, designed
to free us from prejudice, entrenches homosexual rights and renders
Christians guilty before equality courts for simply quoting the Bible.
Poverty, on the other hand, has been addressed globally through population
control conventions which South Africa is party to, resulting in measures
like CTOP which today has provided for the legal abortion of 230Â 000 unborn
South African babies and pressure on health workers to participate in
abortions against their will.

I would like to tell the hon Deputy President that this is a lack of
respect for life. Indeed, hon Dorothy, why should our children trust us?
HIV/Aids also conveniently contributes to population control, and natural
health and antiretrovirals are obviously a spoke in the wheel, while
starvation due to land grabs also proved useful in reducing numbers in
Africa and ensuring dependency. The gambling and lotteries Act is an
ingenious way to divert attention and ensure no real solutions to the curse
of poverty.

Solutions to health issues are also very interesting. A euthanasia Bill
hovers in the wings ready to help people to choose to end their lives - an
innovative solution to old age, Aids, disability and other ailments.

Presently though, abortion, oral sex, masturbation, homosexual lifestyles
and condoms pose as life savers, but, in fact, are designed to achieve
population targets.

I would like to tell the Deputy President that with regard to moral
regeneration this is just the tip of the iceberg. Now anyone, like myself,
who opposes the humanist in this plan of salvation by law and liberal
policies, is by their definition an evil person conspiring against the good
of society. We should not be deceived. Moral regeneration is a smoke
screen. It is simply a call for more freedom to sell and use pornography in
spite of rape statistics, legalisation and decriminalisation of
prostitution, deconstruction of marriage and family, more homosexual
rights, sex tourism, condoms, and blatant advertising of licentious sex.

Health workers are forced against their will to violently remove tiny
unborn babies from their mothers' wombs and carry their little bodies to
incinerators, there is more freedom to gamble, no discipline for children
who apparently are just naturally going to get the urge to do what is right
and of course more protection for criminals and definitely no punishment.
These are all rights protected under the Constitution and fiercely defended
by politicians in the ANC, the DA and most other parties despite the
disastrous consequences to family and society. Now then, how do we
transform a society that demands every decadent freedom but despairs at the
resulting chaos and destruction those freedoms inevitably bring?

This is a society which has bought the lie that the very laws, policies and
behaviour that have morally bankrupted society will save it.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, ons is besig met 'n debat oor
morele vernuwing om die sedelike karakter van die samelewing te herstel. As
ons so 'n debat voer, dan moet ons ook ons hand in eie boesem steek. Die
vraag kan met reg gevra word: Is ons besig met morele vernuwing in die
Parlement as ons 'n aborsiewet goedkeur, waar 'n veertienjarige kind kan
besluit oor lewe en dood? Is ons besig met morele vernuwing as die
Parlement 'n dobbelwet goedkeur, waar gesinne aan die einde van die dag
honger ly omdat daar nie geld is nie?

Ons kan ook vir diÃ© Parlement vra: Is ons besig met morele vernuwing as die
Regering kondome uitdeel om vigs te bekamp? Of ons dit wil weet of nie: Die
grootste oorsaak vir die verspreiding van vigs is 'n gedragsprobleem 'n
gedrag wat sekerlik nie getuig van hoÃ« morele waardes nie. Ons kan nie hier
kom en soos 'n Pontius Pilatus ons hande in onskuld was en sÃª: Dis die vrye
keuse van die individu nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, we are busy with a debate on moral
regeneration to restore the moral character of our society. If we are
having this debate then we should search our own hearts. The question can
rightly be asked: Are we dealing with moral regeneration in Parliament when
we approve an abortion Act, where a fourteen-year-old child can decide on
issues of life and death? Are we dealing with moral regeneration when
Parliament approves a gambling Act, where families at the end of the day go
hungry because there is no money?

We can also ask this Parliament: Are we dealing with moral regeneration
when the Government hands out condoms to fight Aids? Whether we want to
know it or not: the biggest cause of the spreading of Aids is a behavioural
problem, a behaviour which surely does not attest of high moral values. We
cannot come here like Pontius Pilatus and wash our hands and say: It is the
free choice of the individual.]

I want to say it loud and clear. Parliament cannot call on South Africans
to work together to restore the social fabric if Parliament itself approves
legislation such as the Abortion Act which promotes moral degeneration.

Een van die grootste oorsake van morele verval is die gebrek aan
dissipline. Waar dissipline ontbreek, moet elke ouer hom of haar afvra: Wat
is hulle aandeel hieraan? Is ons nie besig om ons plig te verskuif na ons
skole toe nie? Ouers is in die laaste tyd te geneig om te dink die
verantwoordelikheid van dissipline berus by die skole. Dissipline kweek
respek - respek vir jouself, vir jou ouers, jou broers en susters en
familie. Dissipline kweek respek vir ander mense. Dit kweek respek vir
eiendom en dit kweek respek vir ander kulture. As ons gedissiplineerde
mense het, dan ontstaan wedersydse respek en wedersydse respek bring morele
vernuwing. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[One of the greatest causes of moral decline is the lack of discipline.
Where discipline is lacking, every parent should ask him or herself the
question: What is their part in this? Are we not busy shifting our
responsibilities to the schools? Parents, of late, are inclined to think
that responsibility for discipline rests with the schools. Discipline
cultivates respect - respect for yourself, for your parents, your brothers
and sisters and family. Discipline cultivates respect for other people. It
cultivates respect for property and it cultivates respect for other
cultures. If we have disciplined people, then mutual respect will exist and
mutual respect brings moral regeneration.]

Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson, we live in a period that Charles Dickens would
have called ``the best of times and the worst of times.'' It is the best of
times because of the freedom we enjoy, and the worst of times because of
the price we pay because of the vices besetting society.

Corruption, theft, crime and poor morality are some of the main features of
the social landscape. Most people in Government and other offices of
responsibility want to gain wealth so fast that they have no time to enjoy
their lucrative remunerations. They go on to stick their spindly fingers
into public funds. Some kill, steal, rape and abduct to please their flesh.

Most of these ills, such as nonpayment for services, defiance of authority
and disruption of classes were hailed as acts of bravery. They are acts we
should live to regret.

We call all those who stood on the rooftops calling for people to disregard
authority then to stand up and be loud in saying to the nation: ``We were
wrong. No two wrongs make a right''.

We call all people to make a fresh start in moral regeneration. We should
inculcate a culture of respect. The young should respect the elderly and,
likewise, the old should show regard for the young. Those in power should
have an ear for the minority. The rich should share with the poor. Those
who live in the leafy suburbs should know that there are those who live in
abject poverty who should be given a thought. We call on people to read
Exodus chapter 20 so that they may be able to improve on their morals.

Motho ke motho ka batho ba bangwe. Batho ba tshwanetse go tlotlana, go

[A person is a person through other people. People should respect one
another, love one another, tolerate one another, and do their work
wholeheartedly. Children should be made aware that threatening others does
not build a community. People should refrain from using force.

Let me conclude by appealing to everyone that a child's upbringing is the
responsibility of all adults. Do people know what a person and humanity
are? We live in times when people do not care for each other, but this is
not the end of the world.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, a great nation, victorious at war, can be
brought down by the collapse of its moral life. This is a silent war which
is, nevertheless, devastating. As a nation, we in South Africa, despite our
historic handicaps, are numbered among the potentially great countries of
the world.

Our victory over the apartheid time-bomb and, particularly, the use of
peaceful negotiations to avert the inevitable bloodbath have raised our
standing in the eyes of the world. The success of this recent World Summit
on Sustainable Development is in part due to this moral high ground on
which we were placed.

That, however, should not lull us into a false sense of security. We are in
many ways a sick society - a society where crime is rampant, cars are
hijacked, people are killed in the safety of their homes, and women and
children are raped and brutalised.

Where, one might ask, did we go wrong? The problem came in the transition
to the new democratic dispensation. In the excitement of the change, the
voice of the church was dulled. Religious values were given a back seat.
The pendulum swung swiftly in the opposite direction. The place of the
Almighty God appeared to have been undermined. As one travels around the
country, people are complaining that our Constitution removed the honour
given to God and that we do not even open our sessions of Parliament with
prayer.

The Bill of Rights, in itself a document of a high standard, emphasised the
rights of all citizens without an equal stress on the responsibilities of
the citizens. We created the impression that we were an ultra-liberal state
out to out-liberal the older liberal states of the world. The speed at
which we churned out laws on prostitution, abortion and sexual orientation
betrayed the presence of an invisible lobby.
I am not saying that we should not have given attention to these matters,
but surely they were not priority matters. Our priority was abolishing
apartheid and racial discrimination with all its vicious socioeconomic
tentacles - landlessness, joblessness, homelessness, waterlessness and
energylessness.

Capital punishment that was a tool of oppression claiming thousands of
liberation forces had to be done away with, but not before we had
established a balanced post-apartheid society in which respect for law and
order and for the rights of others was firmly established. Our repeal of
capital punishment gave the impression of a laissez-faire society. This was
clearly not intended, but nevertheless became a grim reality.

We now need to slow down our pace ... [Time expired.]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Chairperson and hon
members, I am going to start this input this afternoon a little bit
differently and make a reference to a book that I was encouraged to read by
an official, Ruan Kitshoff, in the Department for the Public Service and
Administration who is focusing
on the anticorruption thrust. He felt that it was something to read because
it dealt with a little village where there were various players looking at
issues including a particular arms industrialist who was clearly persecuted
by his painful past.

Listening to the debate today - and I must say that the author of this book
is a Brazilian called Paulo Coelho - it is very clear that there are some
members in this House who are haunted by a past that they cannot even
confront today. They then use this podium even to take issue during this
kind of debate on why they have such a small number of votes and hence do
not want to subscribe to the kind of framework that has been set down in
this Parliament to deal with the issue of fairness and to allow
participation. The kind of people who are willing to stand on roofs and
make noises and misleadÃ¿.Ã¿.Ã¿. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, there is a point of
order.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson, is the Minister willing to take a question?

The MINISTER: Chairperson, I will take a question at the end of my input if
there is still time.

The book I am referring to is called The Devil and Miss Prym. I suggest
that some members should go and read it, they may relate to it. It is set
in a small village of 281 inhabitants. In essence the story is about this
persecuted arms industrialist who comes to the village and tempts the
villagers to commit a murder in return for some gold bars. It is enough to
make the village rich for years to come, and the industrialist has the
assumption that all persons are evil or, differently put, all mankind is
the instrument of evil. It takes a few inhabitants of the village to resist
the temptation to kill for gold and eventually the dark deed is averted.

It really takes the action of a simple barmaid to avert the greed of the
villagers translating into a bigger evil. Quite simply put, it is for too
simplistic for the current situation that we confront, but let us look at
the relevance of this story in terms of how it presents self-centred people
and raises questions about the powerful role of the church in communities
and how this can be abused. I want to emphasise the abuse of it, because we
also have different presentations here today with different interpretations
of religion and the church.

It goes further in how it reflects on the context of the church
interpreting reality to simple folks in an attempt to shape the behaviour
of people. Let us come to the temptation of gold to the village and our
reality in the country, particularly the Public Service.

Just like this industrialist, who assumes that all people are evil, a
perception exists that all of the Public Service and all public officials
are lazy and corrupt. Just like the persecuted industrialist in this story,
it is many of the rich or developed countries and multinationals that come
and exploit the natural resources and the poverty of our continent and in
the process offer wealth in return for corrupt behaviour; in fact,
encourage corrupt behaviour. Remember, it is a persecuted businessman doing
that.

Just like the businessman tries to bribe the villagers to commit the
murder, increasingly businesses both globally and locally try, and even
your average citizen tries, to seek to exploit our employees by offering
some wealth in return for preferential treatment.
In the story, the murder was averted by the intervention of an ordinary
woman, a barmaid in this instance. She would probably have been declared a
sinner by the likes of hon Dudley, but she averted this. She was the
youngest person of the village, and it shows that we need everyone, young
or old, in leadership or not, to act against corrupt behaviour and moral
degeneration. We do not need the kind of negativity we have seen here this
afternoon, that says hang, hang; kill, kill; cut, cut; chop, chop and you
will solve the problem. It does not work that way. That is much too simple.
It happens elsewhere; it does not happen in the real world and this can be
checked.

Let me share with members this afternoon the contribution I think the
Public Service is making, can make, should make, in the fight against
corruption and how it will contribute towards moral regeneration. Mind you,
all of us need to play a role, there is no room for spectators. It is not
Minister Balfour's matches where he needs the spectators; it needs
participants.

The basic values and principles of public administration are set out in
chapter 10 of our Constitution. The first mentioned is ``A high standard of
professional ethics must be promoted and maintained.'' Contrary to the
often narrow interpretation applied to mean noncorrupt behaviour, our
interpretation of professional ethics must be broader.

An ethical organisation is one that treats its customers with compassion
and selflessness where people really come first, that is, Batho Pele; uses
its own and the country's human, natural and cultural resources
efficiently, effectively, and sustainably; remains accountable for its
action and transparent in its working; internally provides its employees
with a supportive, just, fair, safe, and developmental environment, and
sets standards for behaviour and does not tolerate the transgression of
standards even if we may wish for more talking time. Let us look at the
standards we set.

The Ministry of Public Service, with the support of some donors,
commissioned research on the prevalence of corruption within public
administration and businesses. The finding of this research will be
released later this year as a corruption country assessment report. We are
targeting its release for October 2002.

Let me provide this House with a teaser or an indication of what is to come
when the report is released. Of the clients surveyed, more that 75% think
that the service they received from the Public Service was either good or
very good. Generally, 89% of the clients surveyed feel they received
honest, reliable and sensitive service, though over 20% complained that the
service was provided too slowly. Whilst the majority of respondents
perceive public servants as corrupt, surprisingly low levels of the
experience of corruption exist, and this we will reveal with the report
when it becomes known.

No matter how low the actual experience of corruption in the Public
Service, any act of corruption is an act too many. Clearly, the majority of
our public servants are honest and caring service providers, but we all
know the old adage about a few rotten apples spoiling the box. These rotten
apples are being weeded out. They have no place in the ethical
organisation.

Each and every one of us in this House and members in the broader South
African society must help us with the weeding out. They need to expose the
problems where they are, and not just anecdotally when they choose to, but
with the concrete experiences that they are confronted with on a daily
basis.

We have put in place the required frameworks that support our aim to
develop the Public Service into a model ethical organisation. To mention a
few, we have a progressive code of conduct; we have transparent and fair
appointment and procurement processes; we require the disclosure of
financial interest by our managers; we have a progressive disciplinary
system; we apply performance management and in general we pay fair wages
and require fair working organisations; we are still battling with
instilling a culture of self-development within supportive organisations;
we constantly review our systems and regulatory frameworks to improve where
we can; we spend ernormous amounts on training and awareness, and generally
we develop the notion of a public service as opposed to public employment,
or ``a job is a job''. We want to move away from that.

Even with all the good systems in place, we find that employees behave in
unethical ways, which may be to deliver a poor service to a citizen. We
find unreasonably long delays in replying to correspondents. We find
instances where public servants try to extract bribes. Thus, in spite of
all our efforts, we cannot attain the ideal ethical organisation, and this
begs the question: What more shall we do?

What is patently clear by now is that we cannot divorce the attitudes and
behaviours of our Public Service employees from the attitudes and behaviour
of society in general.

This brings out the second reality. In order to change the attitudes and
behaviour of Public Service employees, we need to change the attitude and
behaviour of South African society as a whole. Then there emerges a third
reality, namely that Public Service employees, by virtue of their numbers
and the visible responsibilities that they act out in society are ideally
placed to serve as a catalyst towards changing attitudes and behaviour to
the good of our country.

In the words and thoughts of the Greek philosopher Aristotle the Polis, or
city state, represents an ideal environment for human self-fulfilment, at
least for those who are deemed to be the citizens rather than the slave. It
constitutes the best laboratory for both personal growth and the exercise
of virtue, because in city states that are properly structured, unlike
despotic empires, men learn to command as well as to obey, they practice
rule and self-rule. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, that this debate on this moral subject is
taking place, is in itself a significant moral achievement for our country,
and for our politics. It demonstrates a ready willingness within our
political dispensation to keep morality in clear and steady focus. This has
to be applauded even as we applaud the Minister for the Public Service and
Administration for wanting to release details of the countrywide survey on
corruption, and the other steps that she and her department are taking.

Having said that, I wish to explore whether we are indeed translating words
into actions. Internationally South African politics still occupy some
moral high ground. We are therefore accorded UN and other important
conferences. This unique moral capital that we have built up, and which we
have accumulated, must be banked and wisely invested. It is a very scarce
commodity in world politics. It is precious and therefore must not be
frittered away.

We must accordingly continue to infuse morality into our politics. We as
the makers of law cannot be breakers of that law. Therefore it follows that
MPs, directors-general, and other senior personages in politics, pay a very
harsh price when they come under the least suspicion. Like Caesar's wife,
as the saying goes, we as politicians have to be beyond suspicion. Yet it
is within the structures of the state, and especially during procurement
and the tender process that a great deal of corruption occurs.

The hon Deputy President dealt with the problem in the private sector, and
therefore I will not go into that. But there, as in the state, we need to
watch this. An investigation is presently under way in Gauteng, for
example, where R40 million odd was paid to developers, but only four or
five houses stand where rows and rows of houses ought to have been.

The Road Accident Fund, the medical aid funds and every other fund in this
country are eroded by certain professionals who have become out-and-out
fraudsters. The circumstances of the death of Colin Govender in Phoenix
have raised very serious allegations against the police, and this has to be
investigated speedily. Inflated and fraudulently charged fees are to
certain professionals and their sidekicks what honey is to bees.

The Jali Commission is also helping us gauge the extent of the malignant
cancer that has spread through many of our institutions. The question of
right and wrong is central to any consideration of morality and ethics, as
the hon the Minister was saying a moment ago. Within this compass we must
also then consider the correctness of delaying permission for Swiss funds
to be employed in the combating of HIV/aids in KwaZulu-Natal.

A gigantic human tragedy is unfolding there right before our eyes, yet, as
we learn from history, as the Emperor Nero was playing the fiddle while
Rome was burning, here too the Minister of Health is temporising while a
very serious national crisis is unfolding. The issue of the Swiss aid is no
longer a political issue, it is now squarely a moral issue.

Another political issue which has become a moral issue is that of people
like colleagues Mike Tarr and Maurice McKenzie who, unilaterally, dumped
those who sent them to Parliament and went elsewhere. Though it might have
been, and might still be politically permissible, it is morally
reprehensible. Also morally reprehensible is the wide use of sheer
brutality as witnessed over the last week in Newcastle, Peddie and Cape
Town, as different speakers have outlined.

The sheer inhumanity of our fellow beings is beyond comprehension. It is
clear that we cannot yet abandon the effort at achieving greater
reconciliation among the races. The charges of high treason against certain
citizens show also that the bullet and not the ballot is still the
preferred mode to bring about political change. That cannot be.

Moral regeneration is not merely an issue of intellectual enquiry, it is
really the vehicle via which we can negotiate and secure the future. At
present, as a society, we have come some distance politically; morally we
are indeed still very short, and therefore we need to find it in our hearts
to rise above our limitations and to move out of the twilight world where
darkness is still not very dark, and the light is not getting any brighter.
This is the twilight zone that we must move out of, into the bright
sunlight of morality.
Mnr C AUCAMP: Geagte Voorsitter, wanneer ons praat van die morele herlewing
in Suid-Afrika, is 'n mens net geneig om te dink aan 'n negemaande-oue baba
wat verkrag word of 'n man wat vir sy selfoon vermoor word of aan
motorkapers en bankrowers. Dan is dit maklik om te praat, want die probleem
is daar ver. Ons moet egter wyer dink. Ons moet dink aan reuse
piramideskemas wat soos paddastoele verrys om ons mense uit te buit. Ons
moet ook dink aan 'n publiek wat wil maai waar hulle nie gesaai het nie en
so maklik daarvoor val. Ons dink aan 'n totale afwesigheid van 'n gesonde
werksetiek. Ons dink aan die gebrek aan 'n sosiale gewete. Niemand kan
eenkant staan, wanneer hierdie onderwerp ter sprake kom nie.

Nou ontstaan die vraag dadelik: Wat is die taak van die owerheid? Wat is
die taak van hierdie Huis? Wat is ons taak as openbare verteenwoordigers?
In die verlede het die staat verkeerdelik self die rol opgeneem van wagter
op Sionsmure. Die staat het besluit wat is goed om te lees, te kyk en te
hoor.

Die primÃªre taak van die staat is egter die volgende: Om deur die
handhawing van wet en orde sorg te dra dat kriminele dade nie ongestraf mag
bly nie. In die opsig moet die leemtes en die agterstande in ons kriminele
regstelsel dringend aangespreek word.

Tweedens, moet ons self 'n voorbeeld stel van skoon administrasie, hoÃ«
etiese waardes en om korrupsie uit te wis. In diÃ© opsig skiet die Regering
ver te kort, veral op plaaslike vlak.

In die derde plek, moet die wetgewing ook getoets word aan die eise van
moraliteit. Hoe kan ons respek vir lewe verwag as ongebore babas in hul
honderdduisende binne die raamwerk van die wet vermoor word net omdat hulle
onwelkom is? As die staat sy welsyn befonds met dobbelgeld en as oorweeg
word om die oudste beroep in die wÃªreld te wettig?

Vierdens moet daar lewensomstandighede geskep word waarin die gesin as kern
van die samelewing eerbiedig word en ouers in die posisie gestel word om
hul kinders op te voed, te dissiplineer en te laat opvoed. Vyfdens, om
werklik ruimte te skep vir die instelling van die burgerlike samelewing om
ongehinderd te funksioneer. Hier dink ons by uitstek aan die kerk.

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, when we speak of moral regeneration in South
Africa, one tends to only think of a nine-month-old baby that has been
raped or a man who was murdered for his cellphone, or of hijackers and
bankrobbers. Then it is comfortable to talk about it, because the problem
is removed. However, we must think more broadly. We must think of huge
pyramid schemes springing up like mushrooms exploiting our people. We must
also think of the public who wants to reap where they did not sow, and so
easily falls for such schemes. We must think of a complete absence of sound
work ethics. We think of the lack of a social conscience. No one can stand
aside when this subject is raised.

Now the question immediately arises: What is the task of the Government?
What is the task of this House? What is our task as public representatives?
In the past the state wrongly assumed the role of guardian of the sacred
walls. The state decided what was proper to read, to watch and to listen
to.

The primary task of the state, however, is the following: To see to it,
with the enforcement of law and order, that criminal acts may not remain
unpunished. In this respect, the gaps and the backlogs of our criminal
justice system must be urgently addressed.

Secondly, we must ourselves set an example of fair administration, high
ethical values and eradicating corruption. On this count the Government has
fallen short, especially at local level.

In the third place, the legislation should also be tested on requirements
of morality. How can we expect respect for life when unborn babies are
murdered in their hundred and thousands are murdered within the framework
of the law, only because they are unwelcome? When the state finances its
welfare with gambling money, and when it is considering to legalise the
oldest profession in the world?

Fourthly, living conditions should be created in which the family, as
nucleus of this society, is honoured and parents are placed in a position
to raise their children, discipline them and have them educated. Fifthly,
to truly create space for institutions of civil society to function
unhindered. Here we think, in particular, of the church.]

In this regard the church has a pivotal role to play. May I assure the hon
Chairperson that a mere general preaching of generally accepted human
values is not enough. That remains moralising. No, people do find their
anchors in a specific religion, with its specific belief, rituals,
ceremonies, and, above all, a personal, vertical relationship - not with an
unknown, general God.

Therefore the AEB will always combat an education system which teaches our
children a vague, general type of human rights religion, instead of
anchoring them in the specific religion inherited and taught to them by
their parents.

Neem kennis: BreÃ«, algemene, grootste gemene delergodsdiens kan goed klink
vir vrede en harmonie, maar dis leeg en hol en kragteloos en geen bron vir
'n nuwe lewe nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Take note: Broad, general, greatest common denominator religion can sound
good for peace and harmony, but it is empty ad hollow and powerless, and no
source for a new life.]

The AEB appreciates the prominent place which especially the Deputy
President gives to the whole issue of the moral fibre of our country. Let
us as Government perform our responsibility and, at the same time, create a
framework for a free society where every role-player can perform their duty
unhindered.

Mr R S NTULI: Chairperson, hon members, there is no argument that South
Africa's morals are slipping to an all-time low level. Can we - that may be
the crucial question - as a nation change this rampant, wayward behaviour?
Yes, it is possible if we mobilise our people, our institutions, churches,
civil organisations, industries and, above all, our institutions of
learning, and, of course, offer strong, innovative leadership.

The media should be our leading advocacy instrument. Much has been said
about the South African Broadcasting Corporation screening morally
unacceptable programmes. Although black people manage the SABC programmes,
the content and culture of this public broadcaster bear little relationship
to us. In a sense we are subjected to American cultural imperialism. This
must come to an end. The SABC must reflect our African culture and value
systems, like humanism, generosity and a caring attitude.

Wanting to change behaviour for the better is not enough. Many sincere
efforts fail because people need skills and idealism to change ingrained
attitudes and practices. We have seen a reflection of this today. People
are better disposed to change their behavioural patterns when they begin to
feel deeply that change is for their own benefit. The evildoers must
discover that their opinions do not protect their interest in the medium-
term and long-term as well as they thought.

We need to provide the necessary motivation in that context through more
effective advocacy, and through forms of counselling and rehabilitation.
The conscience of the nation must be stirred until it is extremely
challenging and distressing to be a wayward person. It is therefore
necessary to communicate to all and sundry the desperation and distress of
all those who suffer. Wrongdoers must wince because of the knowledge that
society rejects their evil deeds.

We must encourage and allow the release of energy, tension, frustration and
disagreement within the bounds of the law. This may seem to disturb the
harmony that we want to achieve, but it is often a necessary step in
enabling people to change. When people consciously try to deal with the
causes of their dissatisfaction, it can prompt them to change for the
better. In order to restore the moral fibre of our society, we submit, each
community or region should focus on clear, achievable goals.

Idealistic assaults to change everything overnight will achieve nothing.
Each community or government sector, as the Minister has indicated, should
focus on topical goals for moral regeneration, which affect people's
interests and concerns. For example, making peace in the Cape Flats,
stamping out car thefts and hijacking in Gauteng, and eradicating
corruption and fraud in Government and in the corporate world. We should
focus on simple but achievable objectives.

We should select tasks which are within our scope, which can be started
now, and where we can expect some measurable success. We have to accept
that building a new social fabric in a society so brutalised and
dehumanised by crime will be a slow, time-consuming process. Furthermore,
building a culture of respect for human rights, given our sad legacy and
history, will need concerted efforts from all of us.

In conclusion, we have to erect a ladder in our minds and progress step by
step in rebuilding a new, morally upright South Africa. When we make
mistakes, we must pick one another up, dust ourselves off, and move on to a
better South Africa, for this is a moral war that we dare not lose. Indeed,
I believe we shall succeed, because a critical mass of people in our
country want a restoration of the lost moral fibre.

Finally, change happens when people from many sectors are locked in a
common purpose, when they will not accept the way things are anymore, and
when they are committed to a common vision driven by them. I submit that
the time has come for us all to embark on the path of moral regeneration.
[Applause.]

Mnr J P I BLANCHÃ: Mnr die Voorsitter, die Regering, en by name die adjunk-
president, het hierdie spitskonferensie oor morele herwinning byeengeroep.
Dit is hartseer dat, nadat hy sy toespraak gemaak het, daar nie een lid van
die Regering in die banke van hierdie Parlement sit nie. Net ons moet
daaroor praat.

Die FA verwelkom hierdie debat, want die tempo waarteen morele standaarde
in Suid-Afrika aangeval word, is skrikwekkend. Dit moet gestuit word. Dit
sal verwaand wees om vanaf die Parlement se banke, of vanaf die
regeringsbanke, die kerkleiers hovaardige opdragte te gee om leiding te
neem nadat hierdie Parlement besluit het om nie langer sy dagsessies met
gebed te open nie, of nadat ons besluit het dat godsdiensonderrig nie deel
van ons skoolkurrikulum mag wees nie.

Ons moet godsdiensleiers en die jeug bemagtig as ons hierdie geveg wil wen.
[Tussenwerpsels.] As ons glo dat kerkleiers 'n leidende rol in die morele
oplewingsproses moet speel, moet ons kerklidmate se bydraes belastingvry
maak. Ons moet dan die opleiding van teologiese studente asook diÃ© van
welsynswerkers op een of ander wyse subsideer.

As dit ons erns is om ouers te bemagtig om hulle kinders morele
waardestelsels te leer, moet ons die elektroniese media aanspreek om die
uitsending van radio- en televisiemateriaal beter te reguleer. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÃ: Mr Chairperson, the Government, and the Deputy President
by name, have convened this snap meeting about moral regeneration. It is
sad that, having given his speech, there is not a single member of the
Government sitting in the benches of this Parliament. We alone have to talk
about it.

The FA welcomes this debate, because the rate at which moral standards are
being attacked in South Africa is alarming. This must be stopped. It would
be presumptious to arrogantly give the church leaders instructions to take
the lead, from Parliament's benches, or from the benches of Government,
after this Parliament decided to no longer open its daily sessions in
prayer, or after we decided that religious instruction should no longer be
part of our school curriculum.

We have to empower religious leaders and the youth if we want to win this
battle. [Interjections.] If we believe that church leaders have to play a
leading role in the process of moral rejuvenation, we have to make church
members' contributions tax-free. We must then also subsidise the training
of theology students as well as that of welfare workers in some or other
way.

If we are serious about empowering parents to teach their children moral
value systems, we have to address the electronic media to better regulate
the broadcasting of radio and television material.]

Government has a policy which says: The polluter pays. If one pollutes the
water, air or the environment, one pays. Why can we not develop a similar
policy for radio and television? We should make them pay for the type of
broadcasting they sometimes send out to our children. Why do we allow them
to pollute our children's home environment?

Daarmee wil ek nie sensuur voorstel nie. Ek sÃª net hulle moet ekstra betaal
as hulle op hierdie manier in my huis wil inkom.

Sou parlementslede leiding wou neem in hierdie veldtog, moet dit nie gesien
word as sou hulle hulself wou verskoon nie. Die politieke partye moet
leiding gee. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[By that I do not want to propose censorship. I am simply saying that they
must pay extra if they want to enter my house in that way.

If members of Parliament want to take the lead in this campaign, they
should not be seen as wanting to excuse themselves. The political parties
must take the lead.]
When a member of Parliament seldom or never turns up to attend plenary or
committee sessions, we must suspend her membership of Parliament. If there
is a male who does it, we must suspend his membership. Taxpayers' money
must not be wasted like that. It is morally wrong and indefensible.

Bishop Tutu the other day told students never to stop asking questions:
about Zimbabwe, about the arms deal, about HIV, etc. He urged them to do
so, because as a role model he wants them to fight for higher moral
standards to promote ubuntu. He is right!

President Nelson Mandela does the same. His life story proves that he is a
man with high moral standards ...
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your speaking time has
expired.

Mr J P I BLANCHÃ: Chairperson, can I conclude? If we agree that a
politician may lie now and then, we lower the moral standards which our
children expect us to live by.

Mr E M SIGWELA: Chair, I do not know whether, after this, I should just
deliver a sermon. I do not know if the Deputy President agrees. I know my
bishop sitting there, Bishop Mogoba, will agree.

Delivering his opening address at the launch of the Moral Regeneration
Movement at 60 Squadron hangar near Pretoria in April this year, our Deputy
President said, among other things, the summit should: firstly, provide an
opportunity to diagnose the past and present state of the moral crisis in
South Africa; secondly, reflect on strategies and measures to reconstruct
the social values of the new democratic South Africa; thirdly, facilitate
the evolution of a dynamic mass movement to help and support the government-
civil-society initiative in planning an effective programme of action for
the moral renewal of our society; fourthly, design a vigorous programme of
action for a sustainable moral regeneration campaign; fifthly, promote
national advocacy for the creation of an ethical, caring and corruption-
free society, and sixthly and lastly, strengthen the foundation of our hard-
won freedom and democracy by building a strong moral society based on a
common code of ethics and behaviour.

I want to focus on the first statement, which is diagnosing our past and
present. I do not have sufficient time to go deeply into that, but maybe I
will just touch on where we come from, and on why we are currently
experiencing all these moral problems.

All the points highlighted by our Deputy President are of critical
importance. But, as I have said, I will look at where we come from, where
everything we are experiencing came from, the manner of its development and
where it is now. [Interjections.]

If we perceive our society as being sick and abnormal, we are quite right,
psychoanalysts and sociologists would agree that one cannot just deliver,
one has to start with diagnosing and dissecting to see what is there, and
to find our where it comes from so as to locate the dysfunctionality.

I am not going to talk about everything that lies behind this problem.
[Interjections.] I want to quote from an observation of the situation as it
presented itself in March 1986. The communiquÃ© of the meeting between
Sactu, Cosatu and the ANC in Lusaka says:


  The meeting resulted from the common concern of all parties arising from
  the fundamental and deep-seated economic, social and political crisis
  into which the Botha regime and the apartheid system of oppression and
  class exploitation have plunged our country.

There it is.


  There was common understanding that the Pretoria regime and the ruling
  class of South Africa are powerless to provide any real and meaningful
  solutions to the general crisis, and that lasting solutions can only
  emerge from the national liberation movement, headed by the ANC, and the
  entire democratic forces of our country.

The seriousness of the economic crisis of our country before the attainment
of liberation cannot be viewed shallowly. It was very deep. It affected
every aspect of life of our people because of the race question, which was
the main thread of its fabric. Even today, the majority of our people are
still reeling under the painfully pounding effects of racially determined
spatial development in South Africa which determined who gets what, where
and how much of it, on the basis of the racial group to which they
belonged.

I want to share an experience with hon members: In 1981 more than 1 600
people were trucked out of the Western Cape, out of Cape Town, because,
according to the spatial planning in South Africa, they did not belong
here. They belonged in the Transkei. They were taken by trains to Umtata.

On that early cold July morning, we as men had to attend to young women who
were giving birth at the railway station, to children who had diarrhoea,
and to all kinds of hardship of the people, only because of the racial
planning of this country, the spatial planning that assigned certain areas
for certain racial groups and not for others. When we see people flooding
into the country, pulling and pushing for space in the areas where there
has been better development, we should not question it. It is the result of
the racial planning of the past.

In 1981 the basic wage of the workers was R10 per week in the factories in
Butterworth. The owners of those factories felt no remorse about this
ominous exploitation of our people in the so-called homelands. Some of
those workers were on the grant list of the South African Council of
Churches, because they had been dumped there as ex-political prisoners. We
could not remove them from the grant list, and my Bishop knows that,
because R10 a week amounted to R40 a month, when the basic grant was R50.

It was embarrassing to remove the grant from the person in order for them
to earn a wage of R40. Yet, the principle said that once the unemployed ex-
political prisoner got a job, he had to be removed from the grant list.
That is the immorality of the system that has given rise to the society we
are experiencing today.

These companies were exploiting people despite the large chunks of rebates
that they were given by the regime of that time. In order to operate as
border industries they were, in the first instance, assured that trade
unions were out of the question. They would not be allowed. The homelands
regimes enforced this. They made a point of it that no trade unionist
emerged in those factories. They would cut their throats. That happened.

The companies were given large chunks of rebates in order to rail the goods
that they produced there from more or less free labour to the markets. It
was almost for nothing, and that was despite their rebates.

This is why when our new democratic order came into being and endeavoured
to change the situation they began to desert, leaving empty shells of
factories, starvation and helplessness. So, when members see the confusion
there, the starving people, the poverty and the filthy towns, they should
think of that. When they see people doing all kinds of things they should
think of their past. I know this is perhaps the history of many of those
border industries of the apartheid era.

These, and other factors, caused the results we got from an income and
expenditure survey of 1996. If members read ``Measuring Poverty'', they
will find that in 1996 a household survey found that among African male-
headed households only 5,8% had an expenditure of more than R3 501, when on
the other hand, 79,1% of male-headed households among the white community
were in that category. Hon members can see the disparity between 5,8% and
79,1%. This cannot make anybody happy.

Among the female-headed households the situation was not better at all,
because in those households only 2,6% of African female-headed households
were in that category, against 42,6% of the white female-headed households.
Those are the statistics that reflect the results of a long period of
systematic crafting of the apartheid society and its state, entrenching
white wealth on the one side and black poverty on the other.

We should therefore not be shocked when our President tries to speak about
this, because it comes out of the system that we allowed to be crafted, the
system which made our society the kind of society that was rejected by the
whole world. Today we are experiencing some of the things that came about
as a result.

Phillip Berryman, who is a Latin-American theologian, writes in Liberation
Theology and says:


  People do not simply happen to be poor, their poverty is largely a
  product of the way society is organised.

I agree with him completely. It is the propensity of the capitalist to
accumulate more and more profits rather than redistributing wealth that is
at the centre of our people's poverty. When we had economics classes at the
beginning of the year our own economists in our own institutions told us
that out of the whole product of investments, our investments are able to
pay labour and capital, but that there is much more that remains that could
be invested in the country. But because we have allowed the profit to be
redistributed to them, they can reinvest it offshore, instead of investing
it in the country.

Those people do not have the conscience to see here is unemployment and
poverty, and that they must reinvest what they get in this country to
expand the economy to create more jobs. As a result this does not happen.

It is said in the Bible in Luke 18:25:
  Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than
  for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.

[Laughter.] [Applause.] This is brought to truth. One sees it classically
when one looks at the facts, and that is the state of affairs into which we
have been relegated.

Therefore, I admire the work that has been done by the Government in laws
such as the Employment Equity Act, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act,
the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act, and the Mineral and
Petroleum Resources Development Bill. I only wish the business sector would
play ball in this endeavour by our Government. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                           VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

  (Consideration of Report of Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of
                    Quality of Life and Status of Women)

Ms I MUTSILA: Chairperson, in the beginning before the white men came to
our beloved country, African families had flocks and fields full of food
and grain. The African families lived in harmony and they toiled in their
fields with pride.

The establishment of the colonial regime in Africa - which commercialised
every corner of the African continent and introduced laws of migrant
labour, influx control and many other controversial laws - separated a
father from his wife and children. Life changed for the worst amongst
African communities and the African social order was never the same again.
Hence the report on violence against women and many other atrocities.

Women became the worst vulnerable victims of colonialism and apartheid.
They had to assert themselves both academically and professionally in order
to meet to the challenges and demands of the new dispensation, which was
imposed upon them. The triple oppression became the order of the day for
most women.

Hune nda bva hone, vhafumakadzi vha khou tambudziwa na u vhulaiwa nga uri

Vená¸a paragraphs follows.)

[Where I come from women are abused and killed, because it is said that
they behave like men in their families. They are no longer adhering to
oppressive laws. They can now speak for themselves. They can even buy
houses and cars for themselves through banks without their men's
signatures. Women can even get equal salaries with men without any
discrimination. This ANC-led government managed to liberate women from
being abused at home, work and even in the community.

But women are now faced with another form of oppression - of being killed
for being liberated. Even though it is like that, our Government is
fighting day and night to stop this by creating laws such as the Domestic
Violence Act and others.]

This report specifies physical and psychological aspects of treatment of
victims of violence. There is an absence of proper counselling for women
who are survivors of violence. It appeared that officials and professionals
where not adequately trained to give meaningful assistance to survivors of
violence.

It further appeared that few health care workers were properly equipped to
deal with both the physical and psychological aspects of the treatment of
women and children who were victims of violence. District surgeons and
hospitals were only concerned about rape victims when the survivors showed
physical injuries. However, many health workers are not trained to deal
with issues of violence. An education and counselling opportunity is
therefore missed.

Violence against women remains a major problem for the South African
society. The problem is prevalent in rural and farming communities, but
often goes unnoticed and unreported. Both Government and communities must
find ways to address the problem of violence against women and children,
specifically based amongst rural and farming communities. This will be a
major, positive development for women as well as men and children living in
those areas. According to the report, rural women experience and witness
injuries, ranging from burns from boiling water to severe heard injuries
resulting in loss of hearing and sight. Steels pipes, sticks, knives,
furniture, fists and kitchen utensils were all used on women in their
communities.

The purpose of workshops must be to raise awareness in order to improve
understanding of gender, violence and increase the extent to which cases
are reported. Special emphasis must be placed on women and children,
protection that the past Domestic Violence Act provides. Since both men and
women are involved, workshop formats should be developed for both single
and mixed sex groups. Workshops should reach the boy child as well as the
girl child in order to bring back the values that our society has lost
along the way.

Mabulasini na mahayani, ri wana vhafumakadzi vho pwanyeledzwa zwihulu nga u
shaya ná¸ivho ya uri musi vho pfiswa vhuá¹±ungu vha ya ngafhi? Vha balelwa u

vhadzulapo ngauri vha á¸o vha dzhia sa khundavhalai. (Translation of Vená¸a
paragraph follows.)

[On the farms and in the rural areas, women are highly oppressed because
they lack knowledge of where to go if they are hurt. They even lack the
right to report their cases because of the unavailability of knowledge.
They again fear that, if they do report their cases, the oppression will
escalate - even within the community - because they will be regarded as
people who do not submit to discipline.]

The workshops, programmes and projects should ensure that farm workers and
rural women know their rights and how to get access to them. Since a very
high percentage of rural women and farm workers are illiterate, it is clear
that the materials that are visual and story-based will have a broader
popular appeal. Basic adult education should also be integrated into the
project. The themes and format of the materials should be developed within
the workshop process where information, perceptions and experiences of
women will be gained. The materials should be distributed through the
workshops, unions, women's organisations, churches, youth groups, schools
and on farms.

Our ANC-led Government developed a policy and edged all departments to
develop programmes and projects which will adequately find ways to adhere
to problems of violence against gender. Thus very important roles of the
programmes and projects will be to prevent rather than to cure. The
Department of Health in its report in 1998 was involved in the
international resolution on the prevention of violence as a public health
priority, domestic violence and mainstream health issue.

The Welfare ministry reported to the community on the achievements and
proposed projects. A services directive for police and other professionals
has been developed. As far as the victim empowerment programme is
concerned, a key programme of the interministerial national crime
prevention has been launched. Departments should develop mechanisms of
monitoring the programmes which they have started. The child protection,
family violence and sexual offence unit in my constituency operates under
very difficult conditions because it lacks facilities in order to execute
their duties effectively.

This unit, which is our Government's first priority to combat violence
against women and children becomes a mockery when they operate under such
difficulties and conditions where facilities are not there. Violence
against women is a national issue. It cannot be politicised. We must not
use it to score cheap political marks. Let us all unite - especially, women
MPs across all political parties - so that together we can fight violence
against women and children. Together we must fight for a better life for
all in all walks and spheres of life. [Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Chairperson, hon members, apartheid institutionalised
violence, including gender-based violence, and gave it a respectable
facade. It entrenched the violence which is inherent in patriarchal
religions and traditions. Thus, the vulnerability of women to HIV and their
sexual and reproductive health status are centrally related to the context
of their lives within a patriarchal society.

Male dominance pervades every aspect of women's lives; including the
family, social, religious, legal and economic aspects. It influences their
ability to be assertive and protect themselves. Relations between men and
women in South Africa are today characterised by a power imbalance that
often manifests itself in violence.

The report that we are debating today stems from public hearings that the
parliamentary committee conducted. A society that is renegotiating new
political, social, economic and moral baselines requires a standard to
guide that project. In 1996, the Cabinet committed itself to the Beijing
Platform for Action. Amongst those commitments was a very critical
commitment in which Government undertook to reduce military spending and
reallocate it to women's empowerment. The committee has reported on that in
its annual report every year. This Parliament has witnessed a violation of
that commitment with the new arms deal.

The other commitment which was critical was in the 1998-99 national Budget
Review. Government committed itself and started to look at specific
programmes in specific departments in order to find out what a gender-
responsive budget looks like. It also gave a commitment that that exercise
would begin to permeate the entire national Budget. That was an extremely
significant commitment. That commitment was a moral standard of note,
considering the history of this country. But that specific commitment is no
longer reflected in the national Budget Review. That was another broken
commitment by a Government that professes concern for the most vulnerable
citizens, ie women and children.

Gender-budgeting is about tools. It is not a stand-alone thing. It is about
Government and Treasury looking at the Budget from a gender perspective in
order to strengthen other legislation that has been passed, and to
strengthen the gender machinery and the committee's monitoring of
Government delivery. At our last committee meeting, the committee took a
decision that it would actually move a motion in the House and that that
motion would be tabled in this House and a debate held. I will refer to
that motion later.

Current strategies for combating violence against women in South Africa are
directed primarily towards the victim. Perpetrators are targeted only on an
ad hoc basis and, at best, individual counselling is recommended for some
abusers. Undeniably, support for abused women is a critical intervention
but is simply not enough. We can no longer focus exclusively on the victims
of domestic violence and subsequent curative services. The introduction of
significant preventative measures has become crucial. To that effect, we
applaud the legislation enacted to address violence against women, ie the
Domestic Violence Act, the revision of the Sexual Offences Act and the
children's justice Bill. But, paper rights need to be translated into
actual rights. Thus, implementation becomes pivotal to that end.

The committee heard feedback from key partners of Parliament ie Case,
Getnet, Idasa, etc regarding Government's performance in the area of
violence against women. There was a presentation of research findings which
had been commissioned by Getnet and Case. One of the questions that was
looked at was how much money Government allocates in its Budget to the
various departments to enable them to implement policy and legislation, for
instance the Domestic Violence Act.

Another question was inspired by the victims compensation fund. The amount
that was suggested for compensating rape survivors was R2 000. Every rape
survivor would not get R2 000, though. Firstly, such a person would have to
report and co-operate with the criminal justice system. Secondly, no
mention was made of the victims of domestic violence. A research study that
was done by Getnet and Case into the Budget allocations for the
implementation of the Act was presented to the committee. The research
showed that money was used more for assisting victims after violence had
occurred.

A grim picture of civil society subsidising Government also emerged. For
example, through structured questionnaires, the Centre for the Study of
Violence and Reconciliation did a series of case studies with approximately
22 women from different backgrounds. It looked at policy documents to
ascertain what Government had committed itself to regarding the Domestic
Violence Act and the policy around the Sexual Offences Act which was put
out by the Justice department. Volunteers from NGOs effectively became
clerks and relieved the department of the burden of courts, and thus civil
society subsidised Government.

Regarding tenders, the report also showed that the documents which guide
Government in putting out tenders to the public indicated a shift in that
Government would no longer provide resources but was going to manage
resources. They would put the work out to other people and just manage that
process. This raises interesting questions because it changes the nature of
government in terms of the Budget.

If we want to encourage women to break the silence, the Government would
have to put an enormous amount of money into programmes aimed at preventing
violence against women and shift budgetary allowances from the less
necessary war toys. Also, the justice and women project saved the
Department of Justice R135 000 in one year - a third of the largest grant
awarded to KwaZulu-Natal. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

[Miss M XULU: Chairperson and the hon House, firstly I thank my party, the
IFP, for affording me an opportunity to take part in the debate about
matters that affect my country. I am also grateful to take part in
discussing the issue which affects everybody - violence against women and
children.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I think that there
is a little problem with the interpretation not coming through. I think
that the problem, also, is due to the fact that the speakers' list that I
have indicates that the language that was given was English. Therefore, no
provision was made for interpreting.

Hon member, you may now proceed. I think that we do have someone in the
interpreting booth now.

Nksz M XULU: Sihlalo, sekuhlalwe ezinkundleni eziningi emiphakathini

[This issue has been discussed in many areas: in cities, townships and
rural areas, but it seems like it is being escalated. It starts within
families where parents are abused by children in various ways. Some
children demand money from their grandparents to an extent that they beat
them. Some men demand food from their wives knowing that there is no money
to buy that food, and the woman end up being beaten; that is violence. At
times one would hear that the baby has been raped by a person who is as old
as the child's grandfather; and also that a man shot his wife and children
then himself, but he survived.

What causes such violence? Is it lawlessness? Does it mean that when a
country becomes democratic, it disregards the law and the rights of others?
The reason for saying this is because it was not like this when we grew up.
Maybe crime was there but people had respect for the law. Criminals were
not as bad as they are nowadays. Now talking about crime seems to escalate
it. Even though some of the crimes have been reported, and the cases opened
they take time to go on trial. The victims even loses hope to an extent
that they question the importance of laying a charge against the criminal.
He is supposed to be sentenced and serve his punishment in jail, but
nothing happens.

In some areas police say that they do not have adequate resources such as
vehicles. Sometimes they say the doctor who is supposed to check the victim
only comes on certain days. Some victims are victimised by the same people
who are supposed to help them. Who is going to solve this problem? The law
should be firm. In yesterday's paper, it was said that the female pastor
was found dead. It is suspected that she was first raped and then killed.
The little girl was raped and killed together with a little boy.

What went wrong? We are dying. We are unable to defend ourselves from
heartless criminals. The law must be firm. Criminals must be sentenced so
that they can work very hard in prison. They should be given less food.

In conclusion, I want to say that even if people can be trained in law but
if the law itself is not firm, that will not help, and it will not help us
as women who are victims of violence. I thank the portfolio committee here
in Parliament that is concerned about the rights of women for taking the
issue of violence against women seriously. [Applause.]]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, I would like to congratulate the hon Xulu on
her maiden speech.

This debate takes place during a week when several brutal attacks on women
have been in the headlines. The 16-year-old disabled Monique Valentine was
shot dead in a gang-warfare-related incident on the Cape Flats. Michelle
Cocks, 31 years old and pregnant, was assaulted, violated and mutilated
together with her colleague, Isla Grundy, aged 47, in the Eastern Cape.
Michelle lost her baby and Isla is still in a serious condition in
hospital. The weekend press reported that a popular lady pastor and her
three foster children were abducted and murdered in Newcastle. We are all
aware of the trial of the alleged murderer of former first lady Marike de
Klerk, currently proceeding in the Cape High Court. The list goes on and
on.

The tragedy is that this is not an unusual week; it is a typical week in
what President Mbeki in his opening address to Parliament in June 1999
called, ``the twilight world of continuous sexual and physical abuse of
women and children''.

SAPS statistics indicate that 37 women were reported as rape victims in
2001. The actual figure could be far higher. South Africa is still a
violent country and women bear the brunt of the violence. No woman is
immune.

The joint monitoring committee is surely one of the more effective
committees in Parliament in terms of the innovative research that is done.
This seminal survey in the field of violence against women and that
relating to women and HIV/Aids, and women in the Budget are examples. All
credit must go to the former Chairperson, Pregs Govender, who has now
retired from Parliament. Her successor, Lulu Xingwana has a lot to live up
to.

Part of the committee's brief is to monitor Government's commitments in
terms of the international convention on the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women and the Beijing Plan for Action, these
commitments having been undertaken in 1995. Both documents detail the
state's obligations to introduce measures to protect the rights of women,
including measures to eliminate gender-based violence.

Before dealing with the joint monitoring committee's report, I would like
to briefly pay tribute to three young women. They are merely representative
of so many others who have triumphed over their victim-of-violence status.
They have become celebrity survivors of sexual violence. These women are
Charlene Smith, Allison - her surname is not revealed - and Alix
Carmichelle. All of them were raped, assaulted and even left for dead in
savage and brutal attacks. All three have overcome their personal
tragedies. Charlene Smith came out and has successfully publicised the
importance of being a rape survivor and for rape victims to have immediate
access to antiretroviral drugs.

Allison, whose survival is perhaps the most miraculous, has written two
books on how she rebuilt her life and Alix Carmichelle has successfully
sued Government for damages for not effectively protecting her
constitutionally guaranteed right to life and security of the person. Her
attacker was out on bail at the time pending his trial for rape. Her
triumph illustrates the Government's failure in terms of its international
commitment and its constitutional obligations towards women. This can have
huge cost implications for Government if it does not improve the criminal
justice system and the protection it should afford the women of our society
against the shocking, horrific violence that is out there daily, stalking
the women of our beautiful land. [Time expired.]

Ms N C NKABINDE: Chair, I should appreciate the fact that issues affecting
women are talked about. However, mere lip service cannot help us achieve
what we want to.

The establishment of the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of
Quality of Life and Status of Women, with its tasks, is impressive and
gives hope that women's issues can be dealt with attentively and
specifically. However, one should mention that information on issues
affecting women and how they can be addressed should reach all South
African women, especially those who are at grass-roots level in the rural
areas. This can only be achieved if the national Government ensures that
gender desks are formed both at provincial and at local government levels.
Through proper co-ordination of all levels of Government, workshops will
have to be held to inform women of such good legislation which they can use
as their defence tool against all forms of violence.

I emphasise the point of holding workshops because not all women know and
understand what is meant by violence and abuse against them. Therefore, if
they do not know that, how can one expect them to understand and use the
Acts that are meant to protect them? This will not only enable women to
fight against violence and abuse, but also give them confidence in
Government as they will be recognised in the communities, that is, their
voices will be heard.

The nonprofit organisations play a vital role in helping abused women to
overcome their ordeal, and so the UDM appeals to the Government to lend a
helping hand in terms of finances for those organisations to be able to
execute their worthy tasks efficiently and effectively.

In most cases affected women do not lay charges against their perpetrators.
This does not happen only with women but with children as well, the reason
being the kind of treatment they get from the SA Police Service and the
Department of Justice. Rape victims find it very difficult to testify in
court. To them it is like undergoing a second assault and they are often
blamed for a sexual offence.

Last year in Richmond alone 284 cases of violence against women were
reported. Of them only 50 were finalised. This is a shocking state of
affairs.

Siyazi sonke ukuthi umuntu wesifazane uyimbali yanoma yiliphi izwe.
Kuyiqiniso elingenakuphikwa ukuthi uNkulunkulu wadala u-Eva ngengxenye
yomzimba ka-Adam. Nokho-ke lokho akuchazi ukuthi umuntu wesilisa unegunya
phezu komzimba womuntu wesifazane. Uma singalwi nale mpi yokuhlukunyezwa
kwabantu besifazane, kuyobe kusho ukuthi silibukela phansi iqhaza lamaqhawe
afana noMkabayi kaJama, kanti negazi lezintombi zeNgcugce kobe kusho ukuthi
laphalalela ize. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[We all know that a woman is the rose of every nation. It is an
indisputable fact that God created Eve with some body parts of Adam.
However, that does not mean that a man has authority over the woman's body.
If we do not fight against this war of the abuse of women, it would mean
that we are looking down on the role of heroines like Mkabayi of Jama. It
would also mean that the blood of the Ngcugce's women was shed in vain.]

Mrs M S MAINE: Chairperson, Deputy President and hon members, the Joint
Monitoring Committee on Improvement of the Quality of Life and Status of
Women was permanently established in June 1998 to monitor and oversee
progress with regard to the improvement to the quality of life and status
of women in South Africa. This is with specific reference to the
Government's commitments made at the United Nations 4th World Conference in
Beijing in 1995 and the provisions of the UN Convention on the Elimination
of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, or CEDAW, in 1995.

The South African Government's signature and the ratification of CEDAW
created obligations to introduce measures to protect the basic rights of
women and improve the status of women by eliminating gender-based
discrimination. CEDAW requires countries to report to the UN every four
years. South Africa's first progress report was submitted to the UN's CEDAW
committee in 1997.

CEDAW defines violence against women as any act of gender-based violence
that results in or is likely to result in physical, sexual or psychological
harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or
arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private
life. It encompasses physical, sexual and psychological violence. Violence
against women is a serious and escalating evil in our society. It is both a
part of the subordination of women and a consequence of that inequality.
The statistics, even though partially known, are shocking.
In recognition of the important values of nonracism and nonsexism which are
guaranteed in the Constitution and the progressive institutions which it
establishes and which support constitutional democracy and the protection
of human rights, the request for gender equality is an ongoing call for
justice. It is our ardent belief that democracy is meaningless if women's
rights are not treated as human rights.

The intensity of the spiral of violence in South Africa and many other
countries, especially on women, demands that certain intervention
strategies be effected to eradicate the pervasive problem in our society.
This requires that, over and above crisis intervention to help victims, a
more holistic approach be taken by social workers and other practitioners
to locate the issue of violence against women in its economic, political
and social totality.

The co-operation between Government and civil society is vital. The
Department of Social Development has formed a partnership with the National
Network on Violence Against Women and it has received financial and
administrative support from the department. The Department of Health also
participates in the national network, but all departments should be
involved.

On interministerial co-operation and co-operative governance, the committee
recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs make a written report on
the development of a gender desk in the department, and the Department's
programmes and efforts which aim to curtail the international and cross-
border trafficking of women and children from South Africa and into South
Africa. Furthermore, what is the role of the department and that of Justice
in considering legislation in this regard?

The National Crime Prevention Strategy adopted by the Cabinet in 1996 is
the Government's flagship and an interdepartmental programme in its efforts
to combat crime. One of the NCPS programmes which affects issues of
violence against women is the victim empowerment programme hosted by the
core NCPS departments. In view of various submissions relating to women's
difficulties in escaping situations of domestic violence in particular, due
to a lack of access to alternative housing, the committee also requires a
response from the Departments of Housing and Agriculture and Land Affairs,
both of whom were not requested to participate in the hearings, on their
efforts to ensure that women are not discriminated against in the granting
of housing subsidies, access to rural housing and land allocation. The
committee is particularly interested in the progress and achievement of the
Women for Housing group in the Department of Housing, with reference to
their April 1998 draft document entitled ``Guiding principles and practice
relating to women's housing issues''.

The effects of violence against women, including domestic violence which is
often treated by police officers as unimportant, are devastating.
Traumatised survivors of rape, sexual assault and violence against women in
general should be treated sensitively. Various legal remedies should be
made available to survivors of violence. It appears from various
submissions that complainants often rely on the police for advice on the
choice of remedy. In some cases it was reported that police tried to
dissuade women from laying charges against perpetrators by stressing
negative consequences for women if they insisted on the arrest of the
offender.

The committee recommends that the Department of Social Development should
embark on extensive training of its officials to equip them to deal with
survivors of violence against women. The committee also recommends that the
Government should prioritise resources, both financial and human, to
projects such as the victim empowerment programme in the NCPS, especially
where they relate to violence against women and children. Separate
budgetary allocations should be made for violence against women in
departments such as Safety and Security. The Department of Finance should
ensure that the gender analysis of the different departments' programmes be
reintroduced in the national Budget.

Finally, I wish to commend Government departments for laws passed and
enacted. Examples are legislation pertaining to customary law on
inheritance and succession, the Sexual Offences Act, the Domestic Violence
Act, equality legislation and others.

We further note the adoption by the Cabinet in December 2000 of the
National Policy Framework for Women's Empowerment and Gender Equality which
affirms, amongst others, the following principle: that women's rights are
human rights.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the following people who
helped compile our report. They are Melissa Fourie, Sheresa Dawood and
Carmine Rustin of the Parliamentary Research Unit. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Chairperson, women are integral to society's task force
in creating opportunities for every person's wellbeing in this country. As
such, we commend the Woman of the Year award recently held in Cape Town.
These are role-players that add to the rich economic tapestry and
competency South Africa is well known for.

It is sad to say that women's status as equal citizens is undermined by the
lack of commitment to enforce current legislation protecting the status of
women. The Domestic Violence Act may soothe the conscience of Government by
doing something through its legislative arm, but its unwillingness to
effectively enforce the law renders such intervention null and void.

The report on violence against women highlights the struggle women face in
getting law enforcers to take their concerns seriously. For instance, the
onus still remains with the woman to show reasonable evidence or proof of
assault. This obligation prejudices the right of women to be treated fairly
and freely. Women are also disadvantaged in the assumption that their roles
are automatically subservient to those of men. The report indicates as much
in that sexual abuse against women, especially coercive marital
relationships, is very often viewed as abuse, adding to the vulnerability
of women in our society.

The report calls for greater public education on domestic violence. The
ignorance around domestic violence impacts on women and men alike. The
hidden hand behind domestic violence is degenerative social values. The
report highlights a number of factors that contribute to domestic violence,
such as patriarchy, militarisation, race and gender oppression, changes in
social order and others.
What concerns me about the report are initial submissions presented by the
public in 1998 and 1999, and then raised again in 2000 and 2001 and those
issues are: difficulties experienced by women victims accessing the justice
system; application forms for domestic violence interdicts were too lengthy
and shorter forms were requested even though there has been an undertaking
by Justice that this would be done; the public is still illiterate and
uninformed about the legislation; the SAPS considers violence against women
as an extra burden placed on them and it is not seen as part of their
ordinary work; there is still a lack of manpower and capacity at
magistrates' courts; massive backlogs of cases, which cause delays of about
nine months between complaint and trial; the Domestic Violence Act has
financial implications and all aspects have not been covered, and
antiretroviral drugs like AZT are still not administered to rape survivors
and many are not able to afford the treatment.

I trust that this report will not land up on the shelf somewhere and be
forgotten. Some of the recommendations therein should be adhered to.
Government should take the leading role and show political will by
addressing the concerns with immediate effect.

And here I would like to raise the issues about our children and, in this
case again, about Monique Valentine. I went to the memorial service this
morning. I must tell hon members that the children are very traumatised by
what has happened. I need to say here that Monique's constitutional rights
were violated. It is said here that she had the right to life, the right to
freedom and security and freedom from all forms of violence, the right to
an environment that is not harmful to her health or wellbeing, and then
there is also section 28 which deals with all our rights. That has been
violated.

Yet South Africa has a wealth of policies designed to put children first.
But the reality is that most children in South Africa still live in
unacceptable conditions in which their rights, housing, food, education,
health care, family care and protection are violated on a daily basis.

South Africa has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. And
here I need to say that the Government unfortunately has failed Monique and
many other children we have buried. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, while we are dealing
with the quality of life of women, let me take this opportunity of wishing
the hon Mrs Tshivhase everything of the best on her birthday today.
[Applause.] If hon members have not noticed she is attired in great
splendour; and to any one else who might be celebrating a birthday today
too.

Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson, in South Africa the exact levels of gender-
based violence are not known because it is underreported. Violence
committed against women is a fundamental denial of basic human rights, and
such violence includes rape, mutilation, sexual abuse, murder and domestic
violence.

According to a study on domestic violence against women, it was found that
rape statistics from January to September 2001 were lower than in 2000. For
the age group 0-17 years, in 2000 the figure was 21 438, and for adults it
was 31 112. The total was 52 550. In 2001, for the age group 0-17 years the
figure was 15 680, and for adults it was 22 045, and the total was 37 725.

There is not a single factor that contributes to violence perpetrated
against women. One of the factors is a lack of economic resources. On the
other hand, the threat and fear of violence keeps women from seeking
employment. It compels them to accept lowly paid, home-based exploitative
labour. Then again, without economic independence, women have no power to
escape from an abusive relationship.

Many women in abusive relationships do not want to leave their partners.
They merely want the abuse to stop. It has therefore became necessary that
we rethink our empowerment programmes. However, violence will not be
eradicated through legislation alone. We need to build peace in our homes,
churches and societies. Peace cannot be attained if violence is still
occurring in intimate relationships. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, the PAC welcomes this report on the
improvement on the quality of life and status of women. The PAC, however
knows that the report is two years old. The PAC believes that the
improvement of the quality of life and status of women can only be achieved
when women are treated as agents of change; not merely as recipients who
are needy, but as participants and givers, not as needy patients looking
for mercy and being mere victims of violence.

Current social, political and economic policies have to provide women with
the space to reclaim democracy and development in order for their lives to
improve, because women are the poorest, most marginalised and most excluded
in our society. In order for development to be sustainable, it has to give
back to women as people who think, assess, evaluate, resolve, inspire,
agitate and reshape the world. Economics is about power. Politics is about
control of that power. The Government policy of Gear has gone wrong. The
PAC reiterates its call for a gender impact assessment of Gear. This will
show that women have lost through this programme.

The Public Enterprises privatisation programme is reinforcing rather than
removing women's poverty. Through the land policy of willing buyer, willing
seller, women will not receive any land and resources on it such as food,
decent houses and means to acquire education. Studies show that owning
assets, bringing in an income and being educated improve the status of
women.

The picture of our country shows regression. More women are living in fear
of eviction from land reminiscent of the apartheid era. The continued
existence of women at the bottom of the poverty pile is an endorsement of
discrimination. It breeds persistent poverty, it breeds violence against
women, and it intensifies inequalities and injustice. The status of a
nation is measured by the status and equality of its women.
Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Chairperson, hon members, I was part of this committee and
listened to the many chilling reports. Yet the question that continually
plagues my mind is: Why is the war against women and children allowed to
continue? I want to deal with the question of substantial and compelling
circumstances and the three myths about rape that permeated the report.

Firstly, rape is often misunderstood as male virility: It is macho to rape
a woman. Secondly, rape is not traumatic unless there are physical scars to
show for it. Thirdly, women collaborate in crimes that are committed
against them: They either ask for it or go somewhere with the perpetrator.
I want to cite three cases from the report that show the deficiencies in
our criminal justice system.

The first case is that of S vs Zita, in which a six-year-old girl was raped
by three men who entered her home armed with a panga for the purposes of
robbery. Despite the girl's pleas that the men take whatever they want and
leave her alone, the three men took turns raping her.

All three men were convicted of rape. During sentencing proceedings it was
argued on behalf of the youths aged 20, 19 and 18 that the circumstances
were substantial and compelling, along with the fact that the three men had
no previous convictions. All three had come from unfortunate backgrounds.
More strongly, it was advanced on behalf of the youths that the little girl
had not suffered serious injury apart from the rape, and that the rape was
not premeditated since the men had gone to the home to commit a robbery.

The second scenario involves a 24-year-old woman who was abducted, tied up
and raped repeatedly by two men. She managed to escape. It was advanced on
behalf of the accused that the complainant had not suffered any physical
injury as she had not been to the hospital. It was further argued that the
men had come from deprived backgrounds.

In the third case, a six-year-old girl was raped by the father of her
mother's boyfriend. He was interrupted when someone entered the home. The
district surgeon examined the girl and her injuries. He stated that her
injuries were superficial. There were just two slight vaginal tears. The
court held that the offence was not of a serious nature and a lack of real
harm was caused to the child.

So legal rights and responsibilities cannot be left to chance. Sometimes we
need to take the road less travelled. We need to say, ``Enough is enough
and no more!'' We need a criminal justice system that is user-friendly and
woman friendly. I rest my case. [Applause.]

Mr M B NTULI: Mr Chairperson, it is an honour for me to be associated with
this debate as this report is being tabled today. Everybody is equal in the
eyes of the law and has the same rights as women do. There are rights that
women have to enjoy. It is also provided in the Bible that they should
enjoy a lot of respect from men, hence there is a saying that behind every
wise man there has got to be a woman. So it is very important that women's
rights should be respected as well.

The establishment of this committee was very important in that it has to
complete the task of the emancipation of women in our country. This is to
ensure the safety of our women. This is to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
that the ANC Government does take care of every sector of society. It is
important to indicate in this debate that it is not only physical action
that can be construed as violence against women. Sexual abuse against women
may also be considered as violence against women. The hearings which we
have undertaken are merely to sensitise women about their rights. In the
same vein I believe that men will, after this debate, take part in
assisting the Government of the day to protect women in this country.

I will concentrate on three issues that is the judicial system in this
country, law enforcement or incarceration of offenders, and traditional
practices and democracy. With regard to the composition of the judiciary,
ie the judges, in this country one finds that the representation of women
is still lacking tremendously in that out of 194 judges only 10 are women
judges. This means that there is a discrepancy in our society, hence one
may find that women are not well represented in some areas in this country.

If one looks at the maintenance laws which we have put in place in this
country, one may find that the forms which are applicable for women to
complete are very complicated, particularly if one is traumatised; and
women are not empowered to fill in these forms appropriately. This then
makes the sentence that is handed down in whatever judgment is given in
respect of women who have committed a crime against their spouses more
severe than those given to a male who has killed his spouse.

Again, with regard to rape cases in this country, out of 624 cases one
would find that there are only three cases which have been tried and in
which the accused has been sentenced unconditionally. This shows that there
is a backlog in sentences that are being passed in this country. So there
is a lack of sensitivity in terms of judgments handed down to any person
who has violated the rights of a woman.

With regard to the criminal justice system, ie the law enforcement agency,
one would find that some of the police are not empowered to deal with a
traumatised woman when she comes to report a case at the police station.
One would find that a question is asked repeatedly without the statement
being taken, which means that the woman has to answer a lot of questions
before a statement is taken from her. One would find that some police
stations do not have privacy, ie the system is not conducive to making a
raped woman, a traumatised person or a child comfortable when giving a
statement to the police.

As far as incarceration of offenders is concerned, we have statistics, but
they do not show exactly what is happening. One would find that the numbers
of people who are in jail are being inflated, which means that not enough
cases are reported because women are either afraid to open cases or are
forced to reconcile with their partners.

With regard to co-operation between Government and society, I think there
should be an outreach programme which will be able to educate the
community, particularly our women, on how to be treated and how to state
their case when they become victims of rape.

I would like to touch on traditional practices as opposed to democratic
practice. The democratic processes that we have gone through in this
country have to be credited to the ANC Government because the ANC
Government is the only government in this country to have put in place this
committee so that everybody, every woman in this country should feel free
to be protected.

I would like to challenge all men in this Parliament to be ambassadors for
protecting our women ... [Applause] ... because all the laws which we have
made in this Government have to be implemented. Men in this country have to
go and educate their wives, their girlfriends and children or vice versa,
because this is important for us in this Parliament. We can make good laws
but if we are failing to implement these laws then it means that the
Government has not done anything. So all members of Parliament should go
out and educate our people on the ground, especially the rural women in
this country. [Applause.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Mr Chairperson and hon members, the first
thing that we need to do today is to extend our warmest gratitude and
congratulations to the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality
of Life and Status of Women. I think they have done a wonderful job in
producing this report, which has enabled us to have this debate today.
[Applause.]

There are a number of questions that arose in the report, and these were
touched upon by all of the speakers this evening. I would like to touch on
two or three of those questions. The first has to do with domestic
violence. The clear message must be that domestic violence is not a
domestic issue. It is not a family issue. It is a national issue. It is a
national challenge. [Applause.] If there is still anybody who argues that
what they do in their own homes is their own business, I think we had
better take them on and let them understand that it is our business.

The second issue that arose, quite correctly too, and it is in the report,
is the question of raising awareness, especially amongst rural women, so
that women know their rights and know how to access those rights. I think
that is absolutely correct.

The question we have to ask ourselves as public representatives is: What do
we do about it? What do we do as political parties to raise this level of
consciousness and this level of awareness? It seems to me that that is an
issue that we need to address over and over again. It is a matter for all
of us sitting in this House to do whatever we have to do. When we do our
constituency work, a critical issue we should keep on addressing is the
question of violence against women and violence against children.

The report asks the GCIS to take on some responsibilities. Let me say here
and now that the GCIS will take on those responsibilities. The report also
talks about other government departments. I think we need to address the
question of government departments at national, provincial and local
levels, and what Parliament does about monitoring the activities of these
government departments and to ensure that these government departments do
what they have to do.

I think Comrade Ntuli was quite right - this was the message all other
speakers spoke about - when she said that we should unite and fight this
together. I think that is absolutely correct. He asked for all the women
MPs to get together. I would say that this is not a woman's problem; this
is a man's problem. I think he had better get the men together. The women
do not have to be convinced about this. I think we have to convince the men
about this. I think we need to take up the issue, which is a critical one
and one we face all the time, that the body of a woman belongs to that
woman and that woman alone. It belongs to nobody else. [Applause.] Nobody
has a right to that body unless the woman consents. I think that is the
message that must go out from here. A woman owns her body, but a man also
wants to own it, and that is what we have to fight.

We have a wonderful Constitution. We have many good laws which have been
mentioned here. There is no doubt that we have made considerable progress
since 1994. But the central issue of power imbalance still prevails in our
country. What this means, as many speakers have pointed out, is that we
have to intensify the struggle. To quote one of the speakers, ``Women's
rights are human rights.'' We have to intensify the struggle for the
empowerment of women and for gender equality, because it is in the process
of that struggle that we will begin to put, at the centre of our agenda,
the question of violence against women.

Many things have been said here about the deficiencies of the justice
system, and those must be addressed. We have to continue to address them.

In the course of the report there are some harrowing stories, and many
harrowing stories were told here this evening. I just hope that those
harrowing stories will spur us on to greater efforts.

As has been said, the Government itself has made clear commitments on
violence against women, and is serious about ensuring that they are adhered
to. Further, under the SADC Declaration on Gender and Development, and
specifically, its addendum entitled ``The prevention and eradication of
violence against women'', all Ministries have made specific commitments on
how they will each contribute towards the goals of that agreement.

As the Chair of the AU, South Africa is committed to ensuring that the
additional protocol to the African Charter on the Rights of Women is signed
by heads of states in its term as chair, ensuring that Africa has an
instrument which addresses the rights of women on the continent. The truth
is that violence against women impedes any prospect of national and,
indeed, regional development.

I think the responsibility of the public representatives is to remember, as
speaker after speaker has said, that a good law is not a good law unless it
is implemented. If it is a law that remains only on paper, it is not a good
law. It is our responsibility as public representatives to ensure that we
actually bring about the implementation of the laws that we have in place.

In conclusion, on behalf of the Government - and, I am sure, on behalf of
all the members - I think we should, in this debate, express our deepest
sympathies and condolences to all of the women who have been violated,
raped, and abused, and more specifically, in this very recent period, to
Monique Valentine and to the woman pastor and her three foster children who
were abducted and murdered in Newcastle. We should say to them, as the
speaker from the IFP said - which should be our message - enough is enough,
we are no longer going to stand by while this happens. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

              print media and on the radio. An overwhelming response from
              people in the rural areas proved radio to be an excellent
              medium of communication. Ninety-four written submissions were
              received, and more than 120 telephone calls from people in
              rural areas.


              Thirty-three candidates were shortlisted on 7 August 2002,
              namely:

              G; Reddy, Mr KÂ P; Schreiner, Mr WÂ N; Sewlal, Adv R; Sibiya, Mr
              KÂ B; Thoke, Mr NÂ S.


              The Committee spent a total of 25 hours interviewing the 33
              candidates in open meetings in Parliament on 19, 20 and 21
              August 2002. The provisions of the Act were duly taken into
              account during the entire process.


              The Committee accordingly recommends that the House, in
              accordance with section 4(1)(b) of the Act, make a
              recommendation to the President that the following six persons
              be appointed as Board members:

     Probation Services Amendment Bill [B 18B - 2002] (National Assembly -
     sec 75), dated 19 August 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Social Development, having considered
         the Probation Services Amendment Bill [B 18B - 2002] (National
         Assembly - sec 75) and proposed amendments of the National Council
         of Provinces (Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports, 11
         June 2002, p 686), referred to the Committee, reports the Bill
         with amendments [B 18C - 2002].


         The Committee further recommends that the Department of Social
         Development, before the Act comes into operation, communicate the
         implications thereof to other role-players in the criminal justice
         system who will be co-responsible for its implementation.


     Report to be considered.

3.    Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Appointment of Public Protector,
     dated 23 August 2002:
         The Ad Hoc Committee on Appointment of Public Protector wishes to
         report as follows:


              The Committee first met on 26 June 2002 and agreed to
              advertise for nominations for the position of Public
              Protector. Seven nominations were received in response to
              these advertisements.


              The Committee met again on 29 July 2002 to consider the
              nominations. At this meeting, the Committee unanimously agreed
              that it would be advisable to invite further nominations, and
              therefore the nomination process was reopened for an
              additional two weeks. Advertisements were placed in newspapers
              for the ensuing two week-ends.


              A further 11 nominations were received, bringing the total to
              18. At this point, however, one of the initial nominees
              withdrew, thereby reducing the total to 17 nominations.


              The Committee then met to shortlist candidates with a view to
              conducting interviews with them. A shortlist of 10 candidates
              was unanimously agreed upon.


              Interviews were arranged with these 10 shortlisted candidates.
              During this process, another two candidates withdrew their
              nominations, and a further candidate withdrew after being
              interviewed.


              The Committee was generally impressed with the high calibre of
              candidates interviewed. However, due to the limited number of
              nominations received, in view of the fact that so many
              nominees had withdrawn, and also given the significance of the
              position, the Committee regrets that it is unable to recommend
              a suitable candidate to the House.


              The Committee therefore recommends that, until the House is
              able to finalise the process of making recommendations to the
              President, section 3(4) of the Public Protector Act, 1994,
              prevails, which reads:


                "(4) Whenever the Public Protector is, for any reason,
                unable to perform the functions of his or her office, or
                while the appointment of a person to the office of the
                Public Protector is pending, the most senior Deputy Public
                Protector available shall perform such functions."


              The Committee further recommends that, in readvertising for
              the position, a range of professional publications be
              considered in order to elicit a greater response from suitably
              qualified persons, including women.


     Report to be considered.

4.    Twelfth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, dated 21
     August 2002:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having heard and considered
     evidence on the Report of the Auditor-General on the financial
     statements of the Legal Aid Board for the year ended 31 March 2001, and
     certain papers referred to it, reports as follows:


         The Committee wishes to acknowledge the good work done by the
         Chief Executive Officer and his team in turning the Legal Aid
         Board (the Board) around from where it was two years ago.


         The Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
         Officer of the Board gave evidence before the Committee on 15 May
         2002 on unsatisfactory matters set out in the first column below.


         In view of the evidence before the Committee that numerous recent
         developments at the Board have resulted in improvements not
         necessarily reflected in the latest audit report, the Committee
         recommends that the Board report to Parliament on a quarterly
         basis on progress made in respect of the areas listed below.

         will be verified by the Auditor-General during the 2001-2002
         audit, and which the Committee will monitor when dealing with the
         report on the said audit.

     1.     BACKGROUND


     The Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests met at 17:00 on 20
     August 2002 in Room V119, Parliament, to consider the recommendations
     of the panel which had presided at the hearing on the alleged breach of
     the Code of Conduct by Mrs N W Madikizela-Mandela.


     The panel was appointed at a meeting of the Committee on 8 May 2002 in
     terms of paragraph 3.5 of the Procedure for the Investigation of
     Complaints.


     2.     CONSIDERATION OF CORRESPONDENCE FROM MRS MADIKIZELA-MANDELA'S
         ATTORNEYS


     2.1    The Committee was informed that on 13 August 2002, Mrs
         Madikizela-Mandela had been advised of the recommendations of the
         panel. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was further advised that she would
         be entitled to make representations to the Committee at its
         meeting on 20 August 2002 in respect of the recommendations of
         panel.


     2.2    On 16 August 2002 Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's attorneys, Savage
         Jooste & Adams, informed the Committee in writing that she had a
         medical certificate for the period 19 July 2002 - 31 August 2002.
         The Committee noted that the letter did not request that the
         meeting be postponed. Instead, it questioned the procedure
         followed by the panel in conducting the proceedings in her
         absence.


     2.3    In terms of section 20(a) of the Code the National Assembly must
         consider the findings of the Committee. It was noted that Mrs
         Madikizela-Mandela is entitled to make a statement to the National
         Assembly when it considers the decision of the Committee.


     The Committee agreed unanimously to proceed with its deliberations, as
     it was of the view that the panel had made its finding on the basis of
     documents before it, and noted that Mrs Mandela still had the right to
     make representations to the National Assembly before the report was
     adopted.


     3.     ADOPTION


     The Committee unanimously adopted the recommendations of the panel as
     amended.


     Recommendations of the panel considering breaches of the Code of
     Conduct by the hon Mrs N W Madikizela-Mandela, MP, dated 7 August 2002:


     Chairperson: Mr L T Landers
     Present


     Mr C Aucamp (AEB)
     Rev M Chabaku (ANC)
     Mr P A Matthee (New NP)
     Mr M L Mushwana (ANC)
     Mrs S Seaton (IFP)


     In attendance
     Ms F Mahomed (Registrar of Members' Interests), Mrs F Isaacs (staff),
     Mr D Ramurunzi (Parliamentary Legal Adviser) and Ms T Mabona (staff)


    1.      BACKGROUND


     The Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests, at its meeting of
     8 May 2002, agreed that a panel should be convened, in terms of section
     3.5 of the Procedure for the Investigation of Complaints, to consider
     the allegations against Mrs N W Madikizela-Mandela. The panel was
     mandated to preside at the hearing on the complaint against Mrs
     Madikizela-Mandela and to make recommendations to the Committee.


     2.     HEARING


     2.1    The hearing commenced at 10:30. By 10:34 Mrs Madikizela-Mandela
         had not arrived. The Chairperson asked the Registrar to explain
         whether Mrs Madikizela-Mandela had been properly informed about
         the hearing.


     2.2    The Registrar explained that the Joint Committee on Ethics and
         Members' Interests had agreed, at its meeting of 8 May 2002, that
         Mrs Madikizela-Mandela should be called to a hearing.


     2.3    On 9 May 2002 Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was served with a notice to
         attend a hearing to be held on 22 May 2002 at 10:30.


     2.4    Through attorney Savage Jooste & Adams, in a letter to the
         Registrar dated 15 May 2002, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela requested that
         the hearing be postponed. This request was acceded to in the
         interests of fairness.


     2.5    A notice informing Mrs Madikizela-Mandela of the revised date
         was sent to her office in Parliament and her office at the ANC
         Women's League on 22 May 2002. She was advised that the hearing
         had been rescheduled for 12 June 2002.


     2.6    Mrs Madikizela-Mandela did not arrive at the hearing on 12 June
         2002. As there was no written confirmation of service on Mrs
         Madikizela-Mandela the panel agreed that a new notice be served
         through the Sheriff of the Court to prevent any dispute on the
         service of the notice.


     2.7    Three attempts were made by the Sheriff of the Court to serve
         Mrs Madikizela-Mandela with the notice of hearing: on 16 July at
         10:00, on 17 July at 14:45 and on 19 July at 15:25. On each
         occasion Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was not present to receive the
         notice. In consultation with Mr Mushwana the Sheriff was advised
         to serve the notice to whoever was present at Mrs Madikizela-
         Mandela's residence. Mr P W Gosani, who identified himself as Mrs
         Madikizela-Mandela's personal assistant, accepted the notice on 23
         July 2002.
     2.8    On 30 July 2002, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela communicated to Mr
         Landers that the notice which had been sent to her residence had
         gone astray and requested that the notice be sent to Mpho at
         facsimile number (011) 376-8428. Mpho verbally confirmed that he
         had received the fax.


     2.9    The panel unanimously agreed that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela had
         received sufficient notice to attend the hearing.


     2.10   The panel noted that the notice of the hearing advised that
           proceedings would continue if the member did not attend. The
           panel agreed that hearings are intended to give the member an
           opportunity to present the facts pertaining to any allegation
           and that, should the member not use the opportunity to present
           the facts, then the panel must proceed with the information at
           hand.


    2.11    Before proceeding the panel considered whether the sub judice
           rule applied in this case. The panel took note of the legal
           opinion of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers, which stated that,
           as the information on the bail application related to a
           concluded pretrial procedure, and the information to be
           considered by the panel concerned the bail application and not
           the merits of Mrs Mandela's trial, the sub judice rule
           accordingly was not applicable to the inquiry being considered.


     3.     ALLEGATION AGAINST MRS MADIKIZELA-MANDELA


     3.1    It is alleged that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela did not comply with
         the Code of Conduct with regard to financial interests. The Code
         of Conduct is an addendum to the Joint Rules of Parliament.


     3.2    Section 16 of the Code states that a member breaches the Code,
         if the member -


         (a)     contravenes or fails to comply with a provision of this
              Code;
         (b)     when disclosing registrable interests, wilfully provides
              the Registrar with incorrect or misleading details.
     3.3    Nondisclosure of donations received


        Section 8(e), (f) and (g) of the Code, as cited below, stipulate
         that members must disclose all gifts, hospitality, sponsorships
         and benefits.
         (e)     Sponsorships:
              (i) the source and description of direct financial sponsorship
                    or assistance from non-party sources; and
              (ii)     the value of the sponsorship or assistance.


         (f)     Gifts and hospitality:
              (i) a description and the value and source with a value in
                     excess of R350;
              (ii)     a description and the value and source of a gift from
                     a single source which cumulatively exceeds R350 in any
                     calendar year; and
              (iii)    hospitality intended as a gift in kind.


         (g)     Benefits:
              (i) the nature and source of any benefit of a material nature;
                     and
              (ii)     the value of that benefit.


     3.4    Nondisclosure of financial interests or directorships in respect
         of the Winnie Mandela Family Museum
        Section 8(a) and (c) of the Code stipulates that members must
         disclose:


         (a)     Shares and financial interests in companies and other
              corporate entities:


              (i) the number, nature and nominal values of shares of any
                     type in any public or private company;
              (ii)     the name of the company; and
              (iii)    the nature and value of any other financial interests
                     held in a private company or any other corporate
                     entity.


         (c)     Directorships and partnerships:


              (i) the name and type of business activity of the corporate
                    entity or partnership; and
              (ii)     the amount of any remuneration received for such
                    directorships or partnerships.


     3.5    The panel considered a third charge of making a "wilful attempt
         to mislead the Committee in your response to the complaint made
         against you".
     3.6    The panel agrees that the third charge is not defined as a
         breach of the Code of Conduct and therefore cannot apply.
         Consequently, the panel recommends that the third charge be
         dropped.


     4.     CONSIDERATION OF THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED


     4.1    A copy of Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's 2001 disclosure form was
         scrutinised. It is noted that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela did not
         disclose any gifts, hospitality, sponsorship or benefits. There
         was also no disclosure regarding Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's
         interests in the Winnie Mandela Family Museum.


     4.2    The panel also considered documents received from Adv Jan
         Ferreira of the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit pertaining to
         Mrs Mandela's bail application (case number 14/9001/01), in which
         the sworn affidavit made by Mrs Madikizela-Mandela on 18 October
         2001 states, under point 5: "My expenditure exceeds my income by
         far and I rely mostly on donations from friends, supporters and
         well wishers."


     4.3    The panel also considered documents from the South African
         Companies Registration Office pertaining to the registration of
         the Winnie Mandela Family Museum CC enterprise number
         2001/044386/23. According to form CK1, signed on 21 June 2001, Mrs
         Madikizela-Mandela, ID number 3609260323089, is the sole member.


     4.4    The panel considered Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's letter of 11
         February 2002, in which she states in paragraph 1 that "the Museum
         belongs to the Mandela children and I have no personal financial
         interests in it, the books are open for inspection if you so wish.
         It is a family home like all of you have your family homes. By now
         you surely know that the matter is under litigation against
         Mandela and Motlanyana and I can say no further. For more
         information you may contact Advocate Ismail Semenya and others."


     4.5    In paragraph 3 of the same letter, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela states
         that "your question based on nonsensical speculative media
         reports, reporting to the quotes from my lawyer who were
         instructed on the very day of my arrest is inaccurate. Surely it
         is inconceivable even to an imbecile that 'I' alone can consume
         groceries of R10 000 a month that is beyond any logical thinking.
         Is it really possible for anyone even the 'supernatural' 'Winnie'
         to get donations of R50 000 per month? Lawyers throughout the
         world are known to argue anything to save their clients. I was not
         even aware that in their desperation to get me out on bail they
         inferred this type of information."


     4.6    The panel also noted that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela did not respond
         to requests for further information on 19 February 2002.


     4.7    In consideration of her sworn affidavit and the denial in her
         letter to the Committee on 11 February 2002, the Committee agreed
         that more weight must be attached to the affidavit.


     4.8    The panel also considered the nondisclosure of the Winnie
         Mandela Family Museum and noted that the Code stipulates that
         members must disclose any financial interests even if members do
         not draw benefits from them. The CK1 form regarding the Winnie
         Mandela Family Museum CC disproves Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's denial
         of ownership.


     5.     UNANIMOUS FINDINGS OF THE PANEL


     5.1    Charge no 1: Nondisclosure of donations received


     5.2    Finding: Guilty


     5.3    Reasons


         The panel finds Mrs Madikizela-Mandela guilty on the basis of an
         admission she made in a sworn affidavit and which was handed in at
         the bail application of case 14/9100/01 on 18 October 2001. To
         this end, the panel finds that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela contravened
         section 16(a) read with section 8(f) and 8(g) of the Code of
         Conduct.


     5.4    Charge no 2: Nondisclosure of financial interests in respect of
         the Winnie Mandela Family Museum


     5.5    Finding: Guilty


     5.6    Reasons


         The panel finds Mrs Madikizela-Mandela guilty of having
         contravened section 16(a) read with section 7(a) and 8(a) of the
         Code of Conduct, in that she did not disclose the Winnie Mandela
         Family Museum and her interest therein.


     6.     PENALTY


     For the purposes of sentencing, the panel recommends that Mrs
     Madikizela-Mandela be:


     (a)    severely reprimanded by the Speaker of the National Assembly;
         and
     (b)    penalised with a reduction of the equivalent of a period of 15
         (fifteen) days' salary.


     7.     FURTHER RECOMMENDATIONS


     7.1    The Committee notes that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's non-attendance
         at the hearing may be construed as contempt of Parliament and
         therefore Parliament should consider whether any further action
         might be initiated in this regard.


     7.2    The Committee notes that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's statement of
         11 February 2002 creates the impression that she may have misled
         the court in her bail application. The panel recommends that
         Parliament find a mechanism to deal with this matter and that, if
         necessary, it be referred to the relevant authority.


     Report to be considered

2.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local -
     The Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government, having
     considered the subject of the Disaster Management Bill [B 21 - 2002]
     (National Assembly - sec 76), referred to it and classified by the
     Joint Tagging Mechanism as a section 76 Bill, reports the Bill with
     amendments [B 21A - 2002].


     The Committee wishes to report further, as follows:


     1.     The original Disaster Management Bill was introduced in
         Parliament during 2001. The Committee conducted comprehensive
         public hearings on that Bill and deliberated extensively on its
         provisions. However, that Bill was withdrawn in order for the
         Department of Provincial and Local Government to comply with
         section 9 of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, in
         particular to allow the Financial and Fiscal Commission to make an
         assessment of the financial implications of the Disaster
         Management Bill, and for the Ministry and Department to consider
         that assessment.


     2.     The present Bill was introduced in Parliament during the first
         half of 2002, and reflected all the amendments proposed by the
         Committee in respect of the Bill that was withdrawn during 2001.


     3.     The Committee notes that the Financial and Fiscal Commission has
         offered the following proposals regarding the funding of disaster
         management:


         (a)     Emergency preparedness for local government should be
              funded as follows:
              *   Start-up costs: conditional grants from national
                  government targeted primarily at municipalities with
                  little capacity.


              *   Ongoing institutional costs: incorporated into the
                  equitable share. Such an increment must be informed by a
                  study of specific financial implications.


         (b)     Prevention/mitigation should be funded as follows:


              Municipalities and provinces should apply for funding for
              specific projects, which should be assessed against the
              national priority list of disaster risks. This funding should
              be on the budget of a national department.


         (c)     Emergency response should be funded as follows:


              A portion of the Contingency Reserve should be set aside for
              immediate response for emergencies:


              *   Funding to national departments should be based upon
                  expenditure incurred. National departments that are
                  frequently involved in emergency response activities
                  should estimate the required amount based upon past
                  expenditure and should budget for such amount. Once this
                  amount is exceeded, an emergency appropriation could be
                  requested.


              *   Provinces and municipalities should fund emergency
                  response activities up to a "financial threshold", after
                  which central funding would be obtained.


         (d)     Infrastructure rehabilitation should be funded as follows:


              National departments, provinces, and municipalities should
              submit requests for reconstruction funding to national
              government. A budget appropriation should be requested, based
              upon the sum of the approved claims.


         (e)     Relief to individuals should be funded as follows:


              The three existing relief funds (i.e. the Disaster Relief
              Fund, Social Relief Fund and State President's Fund) should be
              combined and administered centrally. The funds should be
              budgeted for, and where funds are exceeded, the Contingency
              Reserve should be drawn upon. The fund should be made
              available to provinces, municipalities and non-governmental
              agencies for payment to individuals.


         (f)     The national contingency reserve should ideally be
              referred to as "central contingency reserve" to reflect its
              accessibility by all spheres of government.


     4.     The Committee acknowledges that the report of the Financial and
         Fiscal Commission is very comprehensive, and expresses its
         appreciation.


     5.     The Committee lacks the technical expertise to evaluate the
         viability of the funding proposals made by the Financial and
         Fiscal Commission. However, it urges the Ministry for Provincial
         and Local Government to give serious consideration to these
         proposals and, at an appropriate time, to report back to
         Parliament on its position regarding the respective proposals.


     6.     Notwithstanding paragraph 5 above, the Committee feels serious
         consideration should be given to the following:


         (a)     Clear principles should be determined for provincial
              governments and municipalities to access funding from the
              central contingency reserve.
         (b)     The possibility of providing funding to facilitate the
              establishment of municipal disaster management centres, and to
              provide an incentive for municipalities to get involved in
              disaster management.


         (c)     The possibility of providing funding to provinces and
              municipalities for prevention and mitigation.


         (d)     The three existing relief funds referred to in paragraph 3
              should be combined and administered centrally.


     7.     The Committee notes that, with the passing of the Disaster
         Management Bill, disasters would be declared twice - in terms of
         the Disaster Management Act and the Fund Raising Act, 1978. The
         Committee urges the executive to consider resolving this anomaly.


     8.     Whilst the Committee recognises the need to have appropriate
         command structures for units of volunteers, which includes matters
         such as insignia and uniforms, the Committee would like to caution
         against an overly militaristic approach to disaster management
         volunteers.


     9.     The Committee urges the executive to expedite the setting up of
         the National Disaster Management Centre with the requisite start-
         up funding and funding for responding to disasters, and the
         appointment of its Head, so that the national disaster management
         framework can be in place as soon as possible. It is also
         important that regulations necessary to support the successful
         implementation of the Disaster Management Act should be in place
         before the Act is put into operation.
