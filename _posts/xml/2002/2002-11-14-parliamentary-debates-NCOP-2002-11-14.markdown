 SOUTH AFRICA'S STANDARD OF LIVING ACCORDING TO THE SA ADVERTISING RESEARCH
                           FOUNDATION (1994-2001)

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G A LUCAS: Chair, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that President Thabo Mbeki, in his statement  to  the  National
       Council of Provinces, referred to an analysis of  the  South  African
       Advertising Research Foundation which had found extensive development
       in living standards for the period 1994 to 2001;


  (2) further notes that the analysis has shown -


       (a)  significant increases in  home  ownership,  provision  of  clean
           water and electricity, access to  household  durables,  such  as
           electrical stoves,  refrigerators,  television  sets  and  music
           equipment, and access to telephony;


       (b)  a steady decline in the proportion of people who earn less  than
           R2 500 a month; and


       (c)  a steady increase in the proportion of those who earn between R2
           500 and R 6 000 and above R6 000;


  (3) believes -


       (a)  this bears testimony to the commitment of the ANC Government  to
           build a better life for all the people of South Africa; and


       (b)  that  it  is  a  vindication  of  the  correctness  of  the  ANC
           Government's policies in rolling back the frontiers of poverty;


  (4) commends  the  ANC  Government  for  making  significant  strides  in
       improving the lives of our people; and


  (5) calls on all people in South  Africa  to  work  with  our  democratic
       government in rolling back the frontiers of poverty.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       zabashonile.
(Translation of Zulu draft resolution follows.)

[Prince B Z Zulu: Chair, I wish to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its  profound  sadness  and  shock  at  the  terrible  taxi
       accident that occurred near Estcourt in which 18 commuters lost their
       lives;


  (2) expresses its condolences to the families and friends of the deceased
       and conveys to them its deepest sympathy;


  (3) notes that these subjects of the King were burnt to  such  an  extent
       that it was difficult to distinguish between male and female bodies;
  (4) calls on drivers of motor vehicles to be careful, particularly during
       the festive season when many people are visiting their  families  and
       friends; and


  (5) calls on taxi rank managers to keep lists of the names  of  commuters
       so that when such  accidents  occur  they  are  able  to  inform  the
       relatives of the deceased.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, we cannot take any decision on it as  we
have no interpreting  service  and  not  all  of  us,  unfortunately,  could
understand isiZulu. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: But that is not an  objection  to  the
motion per se.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, it is not an objection to the  motion,  but
an objection to the fact that we could not understand what  the  hon  Prince
Zulu has proposed for this House to take a decision on.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you very much,  hon  member.  We
will look into that question of the interpreter.

It seems that there is no objection to the motion. So, the motion is  agreed
to.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, this House objects to your  ruling  because
we cannot take a decision if we have not voted on it, and we cannot vote  if
we cannot understand. Therefore, I urge you, Mr Chair, to let it stand  over
and let us get the interpretation of it.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Mr Van  Niekerk,  thank  you  very
much. We will actually look into that. It is a pity that there is no  device
for interpretation.

This is a  provincial  matter,  therefore  I  would  like  to  know  whether
provinces have any objection to it.

Hon member, are you rising on a point of order?

Mr M V MOOSA: Yes. Chairperson, I believe that the motion is a  good  motion
and it has been coloured by  the  debate.  It  may  help  if  somebody  just
interprets it and explains it so that the House can support it.

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I think it is quite correct and  fair  that  if
we do not understand the language in which the hon member has presented  it,
we just ask what the content of the motion is. Nobody is objecting to it  as
yet. We only want to  know  what  the  hon  member  said  as  there  was  no
interpreting service. I think it is a fair request that we  just  hear  what
is going on.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: There is no objection to  the  motion.
The only issue is that the members want it to be  put  in  a  language  that
they understand. I wonder if the hon Prince Zulu  could  actually  read  the
motion in English, as a compromise. [Interjections.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Chairperson, I would like to volunteer to  interpret  the
motion. But I think this thing must be taken very seriously.  Since  I  came
to this House last August I have noticed it. It  is  a  very  serious  thing
that we do not have our African languages interpreted. It sets  a  very  bad
example for the country at  large,  when  the  highest  institution  in  the
country is not able to undertake such an important task  of  ensuring  that,
diverse a country as we  are,  we  are  in  a  position  to  understand  one
another. [Applause.]

Chairperson, as you know that I am not an expert interpreter,  I  will  just
try to interpret in the context of the content, as Mr Ackermann requested.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, hon member.

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: The motion without notice refers to  the  accident  which
took place in a place called  Mtshezi  in  KwaZulu-Natal  and  in  which  18
people  died.  The  motion  requests  this  House  to  express  its  sincere
condolences to the families  and  relatives  of  the  deceased.  It  further
requests that drivers of motor vehicles take  extreme  care,  especially  at
this period when we are approaching the festive season when there will be  a
lot of traffic  and  other  things.  The  motion  also  requests  that  rank
managers keep a register of the names of passengers who board taxis.

That is the interpretation. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you,  hon  member,  for  that
interpretation. It must be registered that it is very bad  that  we  do  not
have people interpreting.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   IMPROVED RATING OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN ECONOMY BY INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chair, on behalf of the ANC I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the resilience of the South African economy, which has seen  the
           country  weather  the  impact  of  the  recent  global  economic
           downturn and withstand the  impact  of  a  substantial  currency
           depreciation;


       (b)  that South Africa's national budget  deficit  was  revised  from
           2,2% of GDP to 1,6% in the current financial year as a result of
           strong tax revenue growth and steps taken to improve expenditure
           monitoring and control;


       (c)   that  provincial  governments'  budgets   also   overperformed,
           contributing to  a  narrowing  in  the  consolidated  government
           deficit;


  (2) welcomes  the  improved  rating  of  the  South  African  economy  by
       international agencies from stable to positive;


  (3) believes the  improved  rating  is  in  recognition  of  an  improved
       domestic macroeconomic policy environment and a financial system that
       is sound and well regulated; and


  (4) congratulates the Minister of Finance and the  National  Treasury  of
       South Africa for  fulfilling  its  responsibility  and  mandate  with
       distinction.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 APPEAL FOR PEACE IN THE REPUBLIC OF TAIWAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that there will soon be a change of leadership in the  People's
       Republic of China;


  (2) calls on the new leadership to withdraw its  400  ballistic  missiles
       aimed at  Taiwan  as  this  action  impacts  negatively  on  regional
       security and economic stability; and


  (3) further appeals to both sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume peaceful
       dialogue in the best interests of the region.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Order! Are there any objections to the motion?

Mr B J TOLO: I object, Chair.

The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES: Order! The  motion  without  notice  will
therefore become a Notice of Motion.

                     IMPROVEMENT IN PROVINCIAL FINANCES
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chair, I wish to move a motion without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the healthy state of provincial  finances  and  that  provinces
       have greatly improved their spending capacity  as  reflected  in  the
       Medium Term Budget Policy Statement 2002;


  (2) further notes that the most notable improvements are on -


       (a)  capital expenditure, which grew massively by 44 percent  to  R11
           billion, from R7,6 billion in 2000/2001;


       (b)  total provincial spending which also increased significantly  by
           over 10,9 percent to R122,5 billion, compared to R110,5  billion
           in 2000/2001; and
       (c)  social service expenditure which increased to R100,3 billion  as
           opposed to R90,6 billion in 2000/2001;


  (3)  also  notes  that  the  turn-around  in  provincial  finances  since
       1997/1998 has created the fiscal space that enables provinces to give
       effect  to  national  priorities  such  as  infrastructure  delivery,
       expansion of social services  delivery,  such  as  school  education,
       social development and housing and strengthening the health sector;


  (4) commends the provincial authorities on these  improvements  in  their
       finances which is proof of accelerated delivery; and


  (5) expresses the hope that this buoyancy will be sustained  and  assures
       national government that it is indeed getting value for money.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

         THE EFFECTS OF OVERUSING MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE (MSG) IN FOOD

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the growing  concern  raised  on  the  effects  of  the  flavour
           enhancer monosodium  glutamate  (MSG)  on  public  health,  when
           overused in food, particularly fast food;


       (b)  that recent research reported by SAPA shows that eating too much
           MSG can cause blindness; and


       (c)  that most supermarkets and fast food  outlets  in  South  Africa
           sell foods and condiments that contain the flavour enhancer;


  (2) calls on the Minister of Health to -
       (a)  establish whether food companies adhere to any policy on the use
           of MSG;


       (b)  make it known whether Government and the  Department  of  Health
           have a policy on the use of MSG in South Africa; and


       (c)  do further research and enquiry,  in  the  interests  of  public
           health, to establish whether foods sold in South Africa  contain
           too much of the MSG substance; and


  (3) further notes that the addition of MSG is severely restricted in many
       developed countries around the world.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  122(1) on the composition of the Joint Committee on Ethics  and  Members'
  Interests be replaced with the following:

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chair, I move on behalf of the Chief Whip of the Council.


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -
       (a)  that women and men observe  the  16  Days  of  Activism  for  No
           Violence Against Women Campaign annually in many countries;


       (b)  that the 16 Days programme links  violence  against  women  with
           human rights and emphasises the need to make these rights real;


       (c)  that the international anniversaries observed during this 16-day

       united in fighting violence against women and children";
  (3) calls upon South Africans  to  support  the  activities  arranged  by
       government in terms of its 16 Days Programme; and


  (4) urges members to draw public attention to  these  activities  and  to
       mobilise against violence.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, it is with  a  sense
of occasion that, as co-chair of the joint committee, I address  this  House
on the recently released statement by the National Treasury on  its  Medium-
Term Budget Policy Framework.

The  National  Treasury  has  once  again   fulfilled   its   constitutional
responsibility and its  mandate  with  distinction.  The  sixth  Medium-Term
Budget  Policy  Statement,  it  should  be  noted,  achieved  the  following
objectives. Firstly, it promotes greater  certainty  and  predictability  in
our budget process. Secondly, it presents a bold programme  of  action,  not
only  for  the  national  and   provincial   departments,   but   also   for
municipalities and Government agencies. Thirdly,  it  proposes  a  framework
that impacts on real growth in expenditure on public services, with  special
emphasis given to social services catered  for  by  provincial  departments.
Fourthly, it substantially increases expenditure  on  social  infrastructure
and development. This is for  me  the  noblest  objective.  The  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement re-affirms our country's commitment  to  eradicating
poverty.

On a more general note, if we take the long view and  compare  South  Africa
today to the position  it  was  in  just  12  years  ago,  we  can  only  be
enthusiastic about our accomplishments and excited about our future.

The miracle of South Africa is that we have emerged from the  shadow  of  an
apparently irreconcilable conflict and an unavoidable racial civil war,  and
we have created and established a common nation out  of  the  ashes  of  the
past.  More  than  that,  South  Africa  has   negotiated   two   democratic
constitutions and has conducted four  successful  nationwide  elections  for
national and local government.

Most importantly,  South  Africa  has  establised  the  ever-expanding  debt
inherited from the apartheid era. Significantly, there have been  impressive
gains in employment opportunities  and  abundant  evidence  of  poor  people
enjoying unprecedented improvement in access to basic necessities.

On this subject, to be more specific, the school feeding scheme remains  our
passionate interest. Our Government is  very  clear  about  one  thing:  Our
children must not go  to  school  hungry.  While  the  integrated  nutrition
programme has not been as successful as we would like it to be,  it  remains
our cherished project. Originally it was a presidential project of  a  dream
come true for our former President Mandela. I am happy to say that, to  make
that dream a reality, during the public hearings we were  reliably  informed
by the National Treasury that Cabinet  had  approved  the  transfer  of  the
school feeding programme from the  national  Department  of  Health  to  the
national Department of Education in 2004. The Department of Education  quite
obviously has infrastructure that is up and  running.  The  Health  Ministry
will play a crucial role in shaping the nutritional content  of  the  school
feeding scheme. This will ensure the successful  execution  of  the  feeding
scheme. All that Cabinet is now awaiting is the transition  plan  from  both
departments.

Of paramount importance is the fact that capital spending on the  integrated
nutrition programme will increase by almost 51% during  the  next  financial
period, commencing in March 2003. This increased  spending  will  compensate
for the rising food prices and will substantially increase  the  composition
of the food parcels.

Permit me the opportunity to refer briefly  to  the  prophets  of  doom.  If
these prophets were living in the era of the great depression of the  1920s,
they would have predicted that the earth would perish by the year  1930.  In
fact, we would never have been born. They  are,  as  hon  members  can  see,
wrong. They learnt nothing from their  predecessors.  As  sure  as  the  sun
shines in the sky we will make a cracking  success  of  the  school  feeding
scheme, because it is a project that is very close to our hearts,  as  close
to our hearts as the children of the nation.

During the public hearings several guests made various forecasts  about  the
prospect of our future growth.  The  National  Treasury,  in  the  statement
currently being debated  in  this  House,  tells  us  that  our  economy  is
expected to grow by 2,6% this year and by an average of 3,5% over  the  next
three years. Our guests from JP Morgan tell us  that  growth  for  the  same
period will be 2,5% and a representative from Sanlam tells  us  that  growth
in our country for the same period will be between 2,1%  for  the  financial
year ending March 2003 and 3,1% for the remaining Medium-Term Budget  Policy
Framework.

It is not difficult to guess what thoughts are uppermost  in  the  minds  of
members of this House. The question is: Why do these  economists  have  such
varying forecasts for the same country and the same period?

I wish to say to the members of the Joint  Budget  Committee  with  all  the
emphasis that I can command that they must not  despair,  and  must  not  be
intimidated by the forecasts of our guests  at  the  public  hearings.  They
must have confidence in the success of our constructive economic policy.

Let this put out them at ease. I quote:


  Economics is the only field in which two people can share a  Nobel  Prize
  for saying opposing things.

While the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement aims to promote certainty  and
predictability,  it  is  presented  against  a  background  of  considerable
uncertainty. This uncertainty  is  demonstrated  by  the  steep  decline  in
equity prices on the  stock  markets,  a  marked  retreat  in  international
finance from developing economies and high crude oil prices.
Let me put hon members at ease. Economics and finance  are  similar  to  the
field of geology. Geology is the study  of  the  earth's  crust.  Geologists
learn more about the  earth's  surface  after  a  volcanic  eruption  or  an
earthquake. Economists will learn more about economies and finance  after  a
financial collapse.

I trust NCOP members will enjoy their interaction with and participation  in
the work of the Joint Budget Committee, and I would like  to  thank  my  co-
chair in  the  National  Assembly,  Mr  Nhlanhla  Musa  Nene,  for  his  co-
operation. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, hon Minister  of  Finance  and  colleagues,  the
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement is presented by the Minister of  Finance
in preparation of the main budget proposals to be tabled early  in  the  new
year. It presents the backdrop of  the  main  tax  policy  developments  and
spending patterns up to that stage, against which  the  next  year's  budget
proposals  will  be  presented  and,   as   such,   prepares   the   various
participating role-players for what can be expected in the main  Budget.  It
even goes further by not only setting out the economic context for the  next
year's Budget, but also  outlines  the  fiscal  policy  considerations,  tax
policy and expenditure priorities forming the basis of the budget  proposals
for the next three years.

The  aims  of  the  Medium-Term  Budget   Policy   Statement,   namely   the
encouragement of informed debate in Parliament at an advanced stage and  the
early and informed engagement of civil society  with  the  social,  economic
and developmental challenges which need to be addressed by the Budget,  have
changed the previous almost erratic nature of budgeting  -  of  moving  from
one budget speech to the next  -  to  a  continuous  and  dynamic  flow  and
interchange of information. This encourages and  enables  civil  society  to
take possession of the budgetary process  and  make  it  their  own  through
their active participation.

Wat  die  begrotingsproses  betref,  ek  verstaan   die   Minister   is   'n
musiekliefhebber. Hy sal dit dan seker in orde vind  as  ek  die  vorige  en
huidige begrotingsprosesse met musiek  vergelyk.  Die  vorige  kan  vergelyk
word met ``syncopation'' wat in Engels gedefinieer  word  as  ``a  spasmodic
movement from bar to bar''. In teenstelling kan die huidige stelsel  met  'n
harmonieuse musiekkonsert, met  die  Minister  van  Finansies  as  dirigent,
vergelyk word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[As far as the budget process is concerned, it is my understanding that  the
Minister is a music lover. He will thus find it in order that I compare  the
previous and current budget processes with  music.  The  previous  processes
can be compared with ``syncopation'' which, in English, is  defined  as  ``a
spasmodic movement from bar to bar''. In contrast the current  system  could
be compared to a harmonious musical concert conducted  by  the  Minister  of
Finance.]

Chairperson, a process without secrets is a process better understood and  a
process better accepted. The 2002 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement is  no
exception.  It  is  an  informative  document  which   gives   macroeconomic
forecasts on a national and global basis and provides the framework for  the
2003 Budget.  It  builds  on  the  growth-oriented  fiscal  policy  approach
indicated in the budgets of the previous two years and  places  priority  on
the fostering of job creation, investment and  growth,  the  improvement  of
service delivery and the alleviation of poverty and inequality.

Voorsitter, die huidige neiging in private kapitaalbesteding is  bemoedigend
en alle aanduidings is dat die gelykmatige ekonomiese groei in  die  komende
finansiële jaar voortgesit sal word. Die werkloosheidskoers van  29,4%,  wat
in syfers na 4,7 miljoen werkers omgeskakel kan word,  gee  egter  rede  tot
kommer. Dit moet egter in samehang met die wisselkoers van die  rand  en  'n
skerp styging in verbruikers- en  produksiepryse  beskou  word.  Die  makro-
ekonomiese perspektief dui ook op 'n prioriteitsverskuiwing  vanaf  dié  met
'n klem op  inflasie,  na  een  wat  meer  die  klem  op  groei  plaas.  Die
aangekondigde inflasieteiken blyk ook heel realisties te wees.

Een van  die  verblydende  aspekte  is  dat  die  verhoogde  staatsbesteding
blykbaar nie met enige skerp stygings in belastings gepaard  sal  gaan  nie.
Die Minister  het  dit  trouens  gestel  dat  dit  een  van  die  langtermyn
doelwitte van die Medium-Term Budget  Policy  Statement  is  om  persoonlike
belasting te verlig en om die begrotingstekort onder die vlak van  2,5%  van
die bruto binnelandse produk te hou. Die Minister verdien beslis  ons  almal
se gelukwensing met hierdie gestelde doelwit.

Dit  blyk  ook  dat  die  inkomstegroei,  as  gevolg  van  die   deurlopende
verbetering in die doeltreffendheid van die  belastinggaarder  se  stelsels,
vir vanjaar op 17,5% staan. Gelukwensing ook aan  die  Kommissaris  van  die
Suid-Afrikaanse Inkomstediens vir  hierdie  pragvertoning.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson,  the  current  trend  in  private   capital   expenditure   is
encouraging and all indications are that the gradual  economic  growth  will
continues into the next financial year.  The  unemployment  rate  of  29,4%,
which, in figures, amounts to 4,7 million workers, gives cause for  concern,
however this should be viewed in conjunction with the exchange rate  of  the
rand and a sharp rise in consumer and production prices. The  macro-economic
perspective also indicates a  priority  shift  away  from  the  emphasis  on
inflation towards a greater emphasis on growth.  The  announced  target  for
inflation also seems to be quite realistic.

One of the more heartening aspects is that the increased  state  expenditure
will apparently not  be  accompanied  by  any  sharp  rises  in  taxes.  The
Minister in fact said that this would be one of  the  long-term  targets  of
the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement to lighten personal tax and to  keep
the budgetary shortfall below the  level  of  2,5%  of  the  Gross  Domestic
Product. The Minister most certainly deserves congratulations  from  all  of
us on this objective that has been set.

It also seems  that  the  growth  in  revenue,  because  of  the  continuous
improvement in the effectiveness of the Receiver of Revenue's systems,  this
year stands at 17,5%. Congratulations  to  the  Commissioner  of  the  South
African Revenue Service on this excellent performance.]

Chairperson, in conclusion it is my pleasure to  mention  that  the  New  NP
supports the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement for 2002. [Applause.]

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I just  want  to  congratulate  my  co-chair,  Mr
Ralane. I notice that he  took  off  on  the  right  foot.  Congratulations,
comrade!

The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement currently being  discussed  in  this
House displays Government's social, economic and fiscal  framework  for  the
next three years. In  addition,  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement
provides elected public representatives and citizens of  this  country  with
an opportunity to discuss  how  we  are  to  proceed  with  the  incremental
realisation of social and economic  rights  as  enshrined  in  our  national
Constitution.

Effective,  progressive  policy  implementation  depends  on  the   combined
efforts  of  all  spheres  of  government,  nongovernmental   organisations,
religious institutions and,  most  importantly,  individual  citizens.  This
also requires synchronisation between policies and  budgets.  The  objective
of the sixth Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement is to give meaning to  this
synchronisation and also to provide co-ordination,  coupled  with  increased
allocation to the provincial and  local  spheres  of  government,  which  in
essence are ultimately saddled with the  responsibility  of  completing  the
task of delivering social services.

We were informed that the Budget in February next year would build upon  the
policy priorities laid down in the 2001  and  2002  budgets.  Therefore  the
Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement  before  us  consolidates  and  deepens
existing budget priorities. Other key elements of the  development  strategy
involve strengthening employment creation incentives, deepening  the  skills
base,  reinforcing  crime  prevention  and  enhancing  the  private   sector
investment environment.
In pursuit of these objectives, the 2002 Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework
prioritises the following areas: extending  social  assistance,  health  and
education programmes administered  by  provinces;  enhancing  investment  in
municipal  infrastructure  and  basic  services  in  support  of  the  rural
development and urban renewal strategies; expanding capacity in  the  safety
and security sector to prevent and  combat  crime,  including  a  particular
focus  on  the  functioning  of  the   court   systems;   higher   education
restructuring, including support for institutional  mergers  and  investment
in infrastructure; accelerating the land reform and  restitution  programme;
re-engineering services to citizens  provided  by  the  Department  of  Home
affairs; and, finally, an increasing international  role  through  increased
regional participation through support for the African Union and Nepad.

Siyakuqaphela nokuthi ukwandiswa kwesabelo semali akusho  ukuthi  imiphumela
yokusetshenziswa kwayo isuke izoba mihle.  Okubalulekile  ukuthi  leyo  mali
esuke yabiwe isebenze kanjani.  Ngabe  sikwazile  yini  ukwenza  isiqiniseko
sokuthi leyo mali eyabiwe ifinyelele  kulabo  bantu  obekufanele  ifinyelele
kubo. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[We all note that increasing the budget does not mean that  the  results  of
its use are going to be good. What is important is how a budget is going  to
be utilised. Did we manage to ensure that that money  reaches  the  targeted
people?]

I want to give just  one  example  of  how  spending  priorities  are  being
translated into better outcomes. Within the integrated  justice  cluster,  a
series of mutually reinforcing  measures  have  been  introduced,  specially
aimed at improving  court  efficiency  and  reducing  court  case  backlogs.
Additional Saturday courts have been introduced as a  temporary  measure  to
reduce the number of cases  on  the  court  roll.  A  new  policy  has  been
introduced which specifies more clearly the criteria applicable for  judging
if a case is fit for trial. This has lead to an increase in  the  number  of
cases being withdrawn. On a pilot  basis,  26  semiautomated  court  centres
have been established with a focus on improved management and  co-ordination
of court processes.

The Durban court process project has gone a step  further.  Full  automation
has already eliminated the incidence of lost and  late  dockets.  Similarly,
the incidence of lost charge  sheets  and  the  wrongful  identification  of
accused persons have also been eliminated. As a result, the number of  cases
finalised by a verdict have increased by almost  34%  over  the  past  three
years, while the trend in the case backlog is beginning to fall.

With these few remarks I congratulate the National Treasury  on  the  manner
in which it steers a difficult ship in trying times. [Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, hon Minister,  financial  markets  are  notoriously
fickle and difficult to analyse, and there is seldom anything certain  about
them. Until very recently, we had at least  the  certainty  about  inflation
targets. That gave a measure of predictability with regard to  our  monetary
policy. We had a reasonable idea about the future trends  of  inflation  and
thus also of interest rates. This was the position, more or less,  until  we
came to the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement.

The Minister of Finance, with the apparent agreement  of  the  president  of
the Reserve Bank, decided to suspend the  3%  to  5%  target  until  further
notice, while the 2004 target remains at  3%  to  6%.  The  reason  for  the
change presumably  includes  the  discomfort  caused  when  the  results  of
inflation targeting translates into too high interest rates. As a matter  of
fact, in real terms interest rates are currently lower than at  the  end  of
last year.

I say this with a lot of sympathy for the conundrum of having to  meet  what
is often conflicting expectations, particularly when  short-term  needs  put
pressure on long-term stability and requirements for growth. Fedusa makes  a
valid point when it says that policy authorities and  politicians  have  the
additional responsibility of managing market psychology and other  types  of
risk perceptions to ensure foreign  direct  investment  and  a  more  stable
rand.

The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework  objectives  strive  to  provide  real
growth in expenditure on social services, health,  education  and  municipal
infrastructure.  This  emphasis  on  poverty  relief  and  social   security
spending is very badly needed. A lot of departmental  effort  and  resources
thus  go  to  projects  which  aim  at  poverty  alleviation.  But  we  must
constantly assess the efficacy of  this  spending,  and  also  the  priority
given to this effort in relation to the core function of departments.

I am pleased about the R1 billion which will over the next  three  years  go
to labour-based  infrastructure  development.  I  think  this  direction  of
poverty alleviation and job creation needs further expansion.

Whilst the temporary measures are essential, given  the  extreme  levels  of
deprivation and unemployment which characterise our society, our real  focus
must be on poverty eradication. The DA believes that the private  sector  is
better equipped to deliver on growth and jobs than the  various  departments
or municipal councils. This is not achievable without  higher  growth  rates
than the present 2,6% in 2002 and 3,5% in 2003, even if these  are  already,
and gratifyingly, upwardly revised projections.

The increased allocation  to  the  primary  school  nutrition  programme  is
particularly welcomed. However, as the hon Ralane indicated,  the  programme
is in need of in-depth restructuring. The delivery for  the  past  year  has
been shocking in some instances and  nonexistent  in  others.  Thousands  of
needy children have not benefited from the present allocation  of  funds.  I
went to schools in Parys where one school out of 11 received food this  past
year. On our farm, due to  the  bureaucratic  red  tape  involved,  we  were
unable to access the available food. This is true for a  vast  area  in  the
northern Free State. The programme must be monitored  very  closely  to  see
that the increased funding reaches its target group.

I wish  to  conclude  by  saying  that  in  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement the Minister continues to do what is a  very  difficult  job  very
well. [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I believe that one  does  not  congratulate  a
fish for swimming in the water because it knows how  to  swim.  Therefore  I
want to echo the sentiments that my colleagues have  expressed  around  what
the Treasury has done and its achievement in this regard.

During the hearings it was communicated to the  committee  that  the  school
feeding programme was going to be moved from the  Department  of  Health  to
the Department of Education. There are  clear  transitional  mechanisms  for
how that is going to  happen  over  a  period  of  time.  I  think  what  my
colleagues have talked about has been a  concern  in  the  past.  Hopefully,
when this function is going to be moved  to  the  Department  of  Education,
which has the infrastructure, we will  see  a  lot  of  improvement  in  the
future.

I just want to touch on a few  issues  which  some  of  my  colleagues  have
raised,  as  a  question  of  emphasis,  in  particular  around  the  policy
priorities which are going to inform  the  2003-04  Medium-Term  Expenditure
Framework.

Poverty reduction continues to remain a Government priority because  of  the
many vulnerable groups in our communities. What we have seen is  that  there
is going to be an increase in allocation to make sure that these  programmes
benefit people directly. Government is undertaking a  lot  of  investigation
at the moment to see what are the best mechanisms for  making  interventions
with regard to communities that are vulnerable and suffering as a result  of
high unemployment and poverty. The committee welcomes that, and a number  of
stakeholders who came to the committee are also in support of  the  enhanced
investment  in  municipal  infrastructure,  rural  development   and   urban
renewal.

The committee welcomes the fact that  we  are  not  seeing  any  new  policy
priorities being introduced, but rather that we are seeing consolidation.  I
think this point talks to the fact that we need to make sure that  there  is
co-ordination  and  realisation.  Programmes  from  all  three  spheres   of
government need to talk to each other so that  they  complement  each  other
rather than compete against each other.  The  committee  was  pleased  about
that, and different committees of Parliament will have  to  ensure  that  in
their daily work and oversight activities over their departments  they  look
at some of these things. We need to make sure that we reach the people  that
we are supposed to reach.

With regard to accelerated land reform and restitution,  what  is  important
to be noted is the need to ensure that the land that has been  redistributed
to people is turned into economic  opportunities  in  the  areas  where  the
people live, in the form of creating jobs and all  those  kinds  of  things.
Government is looking at mechanisms to support these people. I think  it  is
an important development that as MPs in  different  constituencies  we  make
sure that we support this kind of programme.

I am not going to repeat  what  my  colleague  said.  I  think  what  is  of
importance is that this is an improvement on what we  had  from  departments
last year  when  the  Joint  Budget  Committee  held  public  hearings,  and
departments belonging to the same cluster came to the committee  and  talked
about different approaches as if they did not belong to  one  cluster.  What
we have seen in these hearings is  that  departments  are  talking  to  each
other, but they are also talking  to  policies  which  affect  one  another.
However, there is still room for improvement in that regard.

Again, as I said earlier on, the different  committees  of  Parliament  will
have to play a critical role in making sure that there is  co-ordination  in
a particular cluster, so that  departments  do  not  talk  as  if  they  are
outside of that cluster. This  will  enhance  service  and  ensure  that  we
deliver services to the people that need them.

My view is that the Joint Budget Committee  established  by  Parliament  has
had very little time to engage  with  the  issues.  We  were  set  up  on  a
Tuesday, and the committee had to sit that afternoon  and  engage  with  the
issues. As the committee has been set up as a full-time  committee  now,  we
have to sit down and plan properly regarding what exactly  is  going  to  be
the role of this committee and how we will engage with  other  parliamentary
committees.

That  is  going  to  necessitate  in  some  instances  a   change   in   the
parliamentary programme which my colleagues will have to  be  aware  of.  We
would have to have a buy-in from different members of Parliament. This  will
ensure that the oversight work of members of Parliament is further  enriched
and enhanced. I would like to thank the hon  Ralane  and  I  hope  that  the
Joint Budget Committee will in future be able to work in a  more  integrated
way. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, let me  express  appreciation  to  all
members of the new Budget Committee, which is under the  leadership  of  the
hon Ralane, for the work that they have done. I think we all appreciate  the
fact that the Budget Committee was set a very  unenviable  task  because  it
was convened right on the eve of  the  tabling  of  the  Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement. I think that it  has  been  a  wonderful  opportunity  for
members to acquaint themselves with issues in the process  of  budget-making
and to engage with various clusters, even though that was not evenly  spread
across all Government departments. I think that that  is  a  very  important
beginning and, hopefully, this work will continue.

Part of what the terms of reference require from the Budget Committee is  to
monitor, on a monthly basis, the expenditure trends in  departments  and  to
talk  to  portfolio  committees  so  that  there  is  a  higher   level   of
accountability. I think that as we do that the work of the Budget  Committee
will  evolve  and  mature,  and  the  oversight  of   Parliament   will   be
strengthened. So, I would like to express appreciation  to  Mr  Ralane  who,
together with Mr Nene, chaired that committee. I wish  them  well  in  their
endeavours and trust that we will be able to develop and sharpen the  inter-
relationship between ourselves.

There  is  very  little  that  members  have  said  that  requires   further
clarification or dispute. Perhaps I should just touch on two  points  raised
in passing which may be worth talking about. The first point  is  the  issue
of inflation targeting which was touched on by the hon Botha.  Let  us  just
go back, revisit and confirm for all to know  that  inflation  targeting  is
the  preferred  option  because  it  gives  effect  to  the   constitutional
imperative which defines the independence of the Reserve  Bank  by  focusing
on issues of price stability. While the interim Constitution  spoke  of  the
internal and external value of the rand, now we  talk  of  price  stability.
So, that is one way in which we can deal with it.

The methodology of inflation targeting is still new. I  do  not  think  that
there is a sense of failure. There have been a number  of  external  factors
that have come to bear on the  economy  in  the  past,  which  included  the
depreciation of the exchange rate, food prices and fuel prices. Fuel  prices
have been affected not only by depreciation but  also  by  the  increase  in
crude oil prices. Those factors have come to bear  on  our  economy.  So,  I
want to emphasise that there is not a sense of failure. If one looks at  the
current literature on inflation targeting, one will see  that  a  number  of
countries that are targeters have actually missed their  inflation  targets.
Those countries include Australia, New Zealand, the Czech  Republic,  Brazil
and Mexico, amongst others. What we are very clear about  is  that  we  must
continue to battle to ensure that there is price stability, because that  is
in the best interests of  the  economy.  Whether  one  is  a  worker  or  an
investor, the ability to take decisions about the future becomes  important.
Abstracting the risk of internal depreciation from that becomes important.

In respect of economic growth, I do not think that we  are  going  to  reach
those magical figures merely because we announced them. It has to be  worked
for. But I think it is  important  that  we  should  not  feel  a  sense  of
despondency. If one looks at the  content  of  our  economy  now,  one  will
understand that there  are  a  number  of  changes.  Firstly,  the  tertiary
services sectors have grown phenomenally. Secondly, our trade  now  accounts
for about 65% of GDP imports and exports. That speaks volumes  as  well.  If
one looks at the content of our  exports  particularly,  one  can  see  that
there is a higher value added on that side. That is something that  we  need
to be thankful for as well.

As one of the resolutions  in  the  House  indicated  today,  the  study  on
expenditure trends released by Stats SA yesterday  reflects  the  fact  that
there is a change in consumer behaviour in this economy. That  is  going  to
be exceedingly important going forward. Of course,  there  remains  a  large
chunk of South Africans  who  are  still  trapped  in  a  vicious  cycle  of
poverty. But we sit in this House because we believe that we can  take  such
collective decisions in the interests of dealing with that poverty. I  would
like to believe that those are the issues that  keep  us  here  rather  than
anywhere else and we must retain the commitment to do so.

The accountability of  Government  for  budgeting  going  forward  would  be
reflected in that interaction, as I said, between the Budget Committee,  its
interaction with the portfolio committee and its interaction with us in  the
executive. We have a framework now, going  forward.  My  invitation  to  all
members of the House is to look forward with enthusiasm to the  Budget  that
will be tabled in the National Assembly on 26 February and to use that as  a
launching pad for a new  kind  of  interaction  between  the  executive  and
legislature in respect of oversight.

I would like to thank very much all those who contributed  to  this  debate.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

     (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Finance
                                  thereon)

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, I  think  it  is
important, once again, to step back from where we come from so that  we  can
be in a position to better appreciate the miles that we have traversed  thus
far since 1994, when the ANC took over power.

We can now say with pride that  we  are  proud  of  our  past,  and  we  are
confident of our future. Why do I say so? One of the reasons is  because  we
have passed legislation such as the Public  Finance  Management  Act,  which
clearly was and will remain a milestone achievement of our Government.

One of the key objectives of the PFMA is to allow  managers  to  manage  and
hold  them   accountable.   Again,   the   PFMA   has   clearly   demarcated
responsibilities between the executive  and  legislature.  The  point  I  am
going  to  talk  about  is  the  realities  of  what  those  demarcation  of
responsibilities are.

Section 30 of the PFMA requires that before  the  national  adjustments  are
approved they must be tabled in Parliament, and they must be  tabled  within
a particular  context.  Section  32  of  the  PFMA  clearly  stipulates  the
circumstances under which adjustments may be made. I will  talk  about  some
of the principles.

In addition to the main Appropriations which were made earlier in  the  year
when the Minister tabled the Budget in February, one of the  criteria  which
should inform  the  adjustment  or  where  the  money  comes  from  are  the
unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances which, at the  time  of  presenting
the  Budget,  one  did  not  foresee  and,  therefore  because   they   were
unavoidable, one had to incur costs.

One of these things was the hosting  of  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development, which all members agreed was a success, as  we  passed  motions
to that effect in this Council. What has been achieved in terms  of  content
from that summit will remain one  of  the  key  features  of  South  African
history.

Also,  Parliament  hosted  the  parliamentarians  from  the   continent   in
preparation for the  launch  of  the  African  Union  and  also  hosted  the
parliamentarians from all over the world during the course of the summit  to
discuss  parliamentary   issues.   Those   things   were   unavoidable   and
unforeseeable. Also, the inflation rate which  is  higher  than  anticipated
also necessitated that there should be some  adjustments  in  the  usage  of
funds which were earlier set aside to be used for those circumstances.

The second criteria is to use  the  roll-over  of  unspent  funds  from  the
preceding year, which is the previous financial year. One of  the  things  I
want to raise regarding this is to commend the department  for  the  gradual
decrease of roll-overs of unspent funds. I think if members have read  their
documents they will see that the  rate  of  roll-overs  has  decreased  very
dramatically, and we should commend the department for this.  However,  more
can still be done in the sense that we must not  allow  programmes  such  as
the integrated nutrition programme, which my colleague  has  mentioned,  and
the HIV/Aids programmes continue to be rolled over whilst we have  thousands
of children who go to school hungry, and the only meal which they  can  rely
on is probably the meal that they are supposed to get at school.

I want to reflect by quoting from ANC Today of 8 November  2002.  The  quote
is as follows:


  Many  South  Africans  continue  to  live  without  adequate  water   and
  sanitation. The majority of women in South Africa are unemployed.  Almost
  half of the women who are employed earn less than R500 a  month,  and  as
  many as 60% of female-headed households are classified poor.  The  growth
  of about 23% of children under the age of six is  stunted,  indicating  a
  lengthy period of undernutrition. The most  seriously  affected  children
  are those in rural areas. The infant mortality rate is between eight  and
  ten times higher in Africans than in whites.

The quotation above is a clear reflection of  the  challenges  that  we  are
faced with as a nation. Therefore, I would  like  to  say  that  every  rand
spent on a poor community, in whatever form, will make a big  difference  to
those people who need it most.

In our quest to improve the lives of the people, let us ensure  that  we  do
our oversight work, and even if the  rate  of  unspent  funds  continues  to
decrease, let us ensure that as far as key programmes that are  supposed  to
be benefiting the poor are concerned, they continue to benefit from them.

On that note, I would  like  to  call  upon  this  Council  to  support  the
adjustments estimate, as requested  by  the  department  for  Parliament  to
approve, but also in compliance with legislation such as the PFMA.

I would also like to call upon members of this  Council  to  scrutinise  the
individual Budget Votes of their respective departments and programmes,  and
the outcomes of what the department wants to achieve  out  of  those  moneys
and programmes that Parliament appropriates from time to time. We  will  not
push  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  if  we  do  not  do  our  work   as
parliamentarians.

I would like to thank my committee members for  their  dedication  and  hard
work throughout the year. However, there is always room for  improvement.  I
would also like to thank the Treasury for its  support,  in  particular  the
Ministry and the Parliamentary Services Office. [Applause.]

Declaration of Vote:

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson,  the  ANC  is  reflecting  on  2002  as  another
historic and groundbreaking chapter in the transformation of  the  education
system of our country. Despite the enormous challenges we  still  face,  and
although these challenges are  still  severely  tainted  by  the  legacy  of
apartheid, they will not slow down our momentum. We are pleased  because  we
have taken up the challenges and converted them into  victories  within  set
time  frames,  and  we  have  not  once  shifted  from  our   constitutional
responsibility.

We are continuing to expand access to  education,  improve  the  quality  of
teaching and learning and ensuring that we free the  potential  of  learners
at all our schools and of students in our higher institutions of learning.

Whilst we continue to face  challenges  within  the  area  of  basic  school
performance, we have, in the past year, begun to see benefits  arising  from
our efforts to turn our education system  around.  The  adjustments  to  the
department's budget do not reflect any changes in  the  commitment  and  key
objectives of Government. In fact,  it  demonstrates  a  concerted  will  to
sustain  poverty  relief  programmes,  infrastructure  upgrading   and   the
attainment of greater equity at all levels.

The ANC supports the adjustment estimate.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of  the  Constitution  (African
Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 16 - Health - put.

Declaration of Vote:

Ms L JACOBUS: Mr Chairperson, the ANC supports Vote No  16  on  Health.  The
adjusted estimates touch on some vital financial improvement areas  such  as
the additional allocation of R50 million to the HIV/Aids budget.

These additional funds will be directed to the  provision  of  post-exposure
prophylaxis and prevention of mother-to-child transmission programmes.  Over
and  above  the  aforementioned  HIV/Aids  allocation,  the  health   budget
includes an additional R2,9 million  that  was  transferred  from  strategic
health programmes for the undertaking of resistance studies on  the  use  of
nevirapine  therapy,  a   further   demonstration   of   this   Government's
seriousness about addressing the effects of HIV/Aids from all angles.

This Budget Vote also recognises that we  need  a  combined  effort  between
South Africa and our SADC neighbours  to  combat  the  effects  of  malaria,
hence the need for the additional amount of R5 million.

However, malaria is not the only disease that gave cause for concern. As  we
are all  aware,  KwaZulu-Natal  has  experienced  increased  occurrences  of
cholera which bit huge  chunks  out  of  their  2001-02  budget.  This  Vote
recognises the difficulties  faced  by  this  province,  and  has  therefore
approved R147 million to support  the  fight  against  cholera  in  KwaZulu-
Natal.

The ANC further believes that this  Budget  Vote  is  in  keeping  with  the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework which encapsulates a political  commitment
to ensure that social services become  one  of  the  key  priority  spending
areas of Government.

In keeping with this, Government has undertaken to spend R167,1 billion  for
2003-04 on social services,  and  is  focusing  on,  amongst  other  things,
primary health care and hospital services.

The ANC supports this Budget Vote.

Declarations of Vote:

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, the aim and objective of the ANC-led  Government
is to improve the quality of life of all South Africans by  promoting  sport
and recreation in our  country,  and  through  the  participation  of  South
African  sportspeople  and  teams  across  the   globe,   especially   those
previously denied the opportunity. For example, the R12,5 million  allocated
for the 2003 World Cup Legacy programme entails the roll-out  and  upgrading
of cricket  pitches  and  infrastructure  in  the  previously  disadvantaged
areas. Moreover, the department has ensured that the training objectives  of
the SA Sports Commission are broadened  with  increases  in  the  number  of
people trained from 2 000 to 2 350.

We as the ANC support the department in its continued mission to  prioritise
the building of a nation in action for  change  through  transformation  and
building a better life for all.

The ANC supports the Vote.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, the investigation of the United Cricket  Board  by
a ministerial committee was an utter waste of time  and  all  of  some  R700
000. [Interjections.] While it is important to focus on the  composition  of
national teams to reflect the demographics  of  the  country,  the  Ministry
seems to ignore the arena where real development  is  concerned,  namely  on
the ground where our children - our future national players -  should  enjoy
unfettered access to facilities, proper coaching and equipment. The DP  does
not support this Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution

Vote No 20 - Correctional Services - put.

Declarations of vote:
Chief M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I note that we are the only party  which  is
going to make a declaration on this  Vote.  I  note  the  objection  by  our
colleagues in the New NP.

I want to state categorically that when one  looks  at  sentenced  prisoners
who are released but are back in our prisons after a  few  months,  one  can
see that our rehabilitation programme is not effective. What  we  should  be
doing as Parliament is to assist the department so that  its  programme  can
be effective, rather than merely objecting.

Again, when one looks at what is happening with  the  Jali  Commission,  one
can see that there is a mammoth task  for  this  Parliament  to  assist  the
department rather than merely to object.  I  consulted  my  colleagues  very
late this morning because I thought we were singing the same song, but  they
are just going to raise a concern, not an objection.

I want to urge all of us to support the department, and assist it  to  carry
out the mandate of the people.

The ANC supports this Vote. [Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, precisely for the reasons that the hon  Mokoena
mentioned,  we  ask  that   our   objection   to   this   Vote   be   noted.

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, we object and I would like to make a  statement.
I want to make this declaration regarding the police.

Die jaarverslag van die  SA  Polisiediens  vir  2001-02  toon  duidelik  dat
misdaad  in  reële  terme  tans  steeds  toeneem,  terwyl   die   beskikbare
funksionele polisiebeamptes verminder het tot 'n laagtepunt van ongeveer  98
000 in Mei 2002. [Tussenwerpsels.] Hiermee saam is daar  steeds  onvoldoende
hulpbronne, waarvan voertuie die grootste probleem is.

Ons kan nie misdaad voorkom  of  oplos  sonder  sigbare  polisiebeamptes  en
voldoende, behoorlik toegeruste speurders om toe  te  sien  dat  misdadigers
uiteindelik in die hof gestraf word vir hulle misdade  nie.  Totdat  hierdie
Regering nie ons  polisiediens  behoorlik  bemagtig  nie,  kan  die  DP  nie
hierdie begrotingspos en addisionele  toewysings  steun  nie.  Die  geld  is
eenvoudig  te  min  vir  doeltreffende  polisiëring.  Daarom  stem  die   DP
daarteen. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The annual report of the South African Police Service for  2001-02  clearly
shows that in real terms crime is  presently  on  the  increase,  while  the
available  functional  police  officers  have  decreased   to   a   low   of
approximately 90 000 in  May  2002.  [Interjections.].  Together  with  this
there  are  insufficient  resources,  of  which  vehicles  are  the  biggest
problem.

We cannot prevent  or  solve  crime  without  visible  police  officers  and
adequately, properly equipped detectives to see to  it  that  criminals  are
eventually punished in court for their crimes. Unless the  Government  fully
empowers our police service, the DP cannot support this Budget Vote and  its
additional allocations.  The  money  is  simply  too  little  for  effective
policing. The DP therefore votes against it.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, I rise to give a  declaration  on  behalf  of
the ANC. At this stage the National Crime Prevention  Strategy  is  starting
to bear fruit. We see that in the  intensification  of  the  empowerment  of
community  policing  forums,  as  well   as   the   existence   and   active
participation of the business sector in the South  African  Business  Trust.
We are also noticing that the community policing forums are now  working  in
tandem with ward committees, and that the Safety  and  Security  cluster  is
well co-ordinated.

All sectors of society are agreed that crime fighting is a  joint  business,
and not only for the police. It is not for us to  blame  the  police  for  a
lack of resources. The lack  of  visible  policing  and  vehicles  that  was
harped on in this House just now,  is  just  a  reflection  of  the  correct
deployment of those resources in other areas of society where they were  not
deployed before.

The hon member is expecting all the police vans and police officers,  as  in
the past, to be roaming  the  northern  suburbs  and  neglecting  the  black
areas. In the past they would  only  go  there  to  kick  and  throttle  our
people. [Interjections.]

The police services and other security sectors are now starting  to  reflect
the true demographics of this country, especially in the higher echelons  of
these services. Only true democrats will support this Vote. [Applause.]

Declaration of vote:

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I want clarity on  some  confusion.  The  DP  put
down that they objected and there was a whisper  here  that  they  were  not
objecting. In case they are  not  sure  whether  they  should  support  this
Budget Vote, I think we should clear up ...

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, on a point of order: Can we decide  on  what  we
object to as a party ourselves and not to be told what to object to?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That is not a point of order.

Mr M V MOOSA: That  is  the  problem  with  Mr  Theron:  He  is  politically
illiterate. It is written here in black and white. The thing is that the  DP
said that they were objecting, and just to make sure  that  they  understand
why we should support this Vote, I am going to say a few things.
The DTI has been busy with restructuring for the past two years.  They  have
almost completed the restructuring process. If anybody looks  at  how  these
adjustments are taking place, they will  see  that  they  are  taking  place
within the context of a number of  laws  that  this  Parliament  has  passed
recently in order to give effect to this restructuring process.

Much of the money in this adjustment is going  to  Export  Credit  Insurance
Corporation, which the DP and in fact everybody else supported  unanimously.
A large sum of this  money  is  going  to  the  Companies  and  Intellectual
Property Registration Office to modernise the office so that  our  companies
and close corporations can register more efficiently and be tracked  in  the
economy. All the political parties unanimously  supported  these  amendments
recently.

A large sum of money is going to technology  and  incubator  programmes  and
industrial  innovation  programmes  of  the  IDC.  I  believe   this   House
unanimously supported that. If  anybody  is  objecting  to  this  particular
Budget Vote, there seems to be no point in doing so.

In conclusion, the DTI institutions that are  receiving  these  funds,  both
the Export Credit Insurance Corporation and the Companies  and  Intellectual
Property Registration Office or Cipro,  will  become  self-funding,  because
that was part of the amendments we passed recently, for example,  to  ensure
that Cipro starts  charging  fees.  They  will  then  probably  not  require
budgets from next year or the year thereafter. They will  be  raising  their
own fees and become self-sufficient. The same applies to the  Export  Credit
Insurance Corporation.

The ANC calls on this House to support this Vote.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 32 - Transport - put.

Declaration of vote:

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I make  a  declaration  on  behalf  of  the  ANC,
especially around public transport and infrastructure.

Bus subsidies were paid to operators who had  lifelong  permits  to  operate
subsidised buses on certain  routes  until  Cabinet  approved  a  system  of
regulated competition in 1997. The new contracts took the  form  of  interim
contracts whereby an existing operator was contracted for a  certain  period
on condition that the lifelong permit would be renounced after  the  initial
contract period and thereafter contracts would be tendered for.

To achieve this transition, escalation clauses  were  built  into  both  the
interim and tendered contracts to cater for  inflationary  adjustments.  Bus
subsidies are based on ticket sales. The escalation clause, coupled  with  a
constant increase in patronage of subsidised bus services, have resulted  in
the actual need  for  bus  subsidies  to  surpass  the  baseline  on  budget
allocation. [Interjections.]

A joint task team of the Department of Transport and the Treasury is in  the
process of investigating alternative solutions,  in  particular  to  address
the targeting of subsidies, with a view to reviewing the bus subsidies to  a
suitable and affordable level.

Rail commuter subsidies are paid to the SA Rail Commuter Corporation,  while
Metrorail, as subsidiary of  Transnet,  is  the  operator  of  the  commuter
service. The subsidy allocated to Metrorail  is  based  on  the  operational
shortfall between total  expenditure  and  revenue  earned.  Metrorail  also
receives capital allocation for essential  maintenance  work  of  a  capital
nature.  The  SARCC  has  experienced  difficulties  to  fund  its   capital
requirements since 1998-99 and continues to experience major  shortfalls  in
its available budget for capital. The maintenance expenditure for  essential
maintenance work of a capital nature continues to rise  at  a  rate  greater
than inflation due to the ever deteriorating asset base,  as  a  consequence
of inadequate provision for capital to  maintain  the  asset  base.  Lastly,
insurance costs continue to rise due to vandalism and increases  in  amounts
claimed for bodily injury by passengers.

                         REVENUE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF  FINANCE:  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  the  Bill
before this House today represents the  closing  chapter  of  two  years  of
fundamental structural tax  reforms,  which  included  the  introduction  of
capital gains tax and the residence-based income tax system, with a view  to
broadening the tax base. This Bill ensures  that  these  reforms  will  work
more smoothly and consistently with one another. It  also  seeks  to  remove
some anti-avoidance rules that impose unnecessary hurdles to valid  business
transactions.

This Revenue Laws Amendment Bill ensures that the  various  tax  aspects  of
all the reforms fully tie together. This adjustment  process  is  a  typical
natural by-product of any major legal  change.  Indeed,  in  many  developed
countries this process can take years to unravel, a process that  we  expect
to avoid with a clear intention of lowering tax  rates  and  rendering  this
economy  a  more  attractive  investment  destination.  The   Revenue   Laws
Amendment Bill accordingly makes technical  adjustments  to  all  the  base-
broadening efforts.

The biggest changes came in two areas.  First,  sweeping  technical  changes
were made for the  tax  rules  regarding  company  reorganisations.  Second,
sweeping technical changes were made for the taxation of  foreign  currency.
Both levels of changes were instigated by extensive internal  review  within
National Treasury and Sars, as well as by taxpayer submissions.

Consistent with  international  practice,  both  areas  are  quite  complex,
representing systems on top of systems, and systems within systems. Much  of
this complexity stems from their objective and transparent nature.  Here  it
needs to be noted that true  democracy  demands  that  all  rules  be  fully
stated within the text of the law. Full disclosure of the law  avoids  time-
consuming requests for Sars  rulings,  and  the  exercise  of  discretionary
powers, all of which could act as barriers against speedy  corporate  action
and could considerably add to otherwise avoidable transaction costs.

Corporate reorganisations are a critical  element  for  any  economy.  Rules
favouring  mergers,  acquisitions  and  other  corporate  takeovers  promote
economic efficiency. Takeovers allow more efficient business  management  to
acquire businesses  held  by  the  less  efficient,  thereby  promoting  the
productivity of the economy as a whole. Unbundlings  are  equally  important
because they allow companies to  flatten  highly  complex  multi-tier  share
structures or to spin off less efficient structures  that  best  operate  as
stand-alone entities with more focused activities.

Although special  relief  for  corporate  reorganisations  dates  back  many
years, these regimes had become too narrow for  a  modern  economy  such  as
ours. The National Treasury accordingly found it necessary wholly to  revise
this regime, especially since reorganisations could otherwise become an all-
encompassing and burdensome tax  event  with  the  introduction  of  capital
gains tax. This regime  was  initially  introduced  in  October  last  year,
covering  company  formations,  share-for-share  acquisitions,   intra-group
transfers, unbundlings and liquidations.

However,  the  relief  described  was  initially  somewhat  limited  due  to
possible anti-avoidance concerns. The current Bill now seeks to expand  this
relief. The new rules allow for a wider  array  of  corporate  combinations,
additionally caters for amalgamations and  also  contains  special  measures
that facilitate the tax free, inbound movement of foreign assets into  South
Africa. Similarly, this Bill  provides  for  the  tax  free  acquisition  of
foreign companies by South African companies.

The most notable aspect of the Bill involves banks, insurance companies  and
similar  financial  institutions.  Under  law  prior  to  this  Bill,  these
institutions could not partake in taxfree company  reorganisations,  because
banks remained the subject of the banking review as a result  of  their  low
effective tax rate.

The Revenue Laws Amendment Bill lifts these restrictions,  thereby  ensuring
that  banks,  insurance  companies  and  similar  institutions   can   fully
participate in tax free reorganisations. This relaxation could  be  afforded
as the banking review  revealed  that  the  low  effective  rate  for  banks
stemmed largely from  other  concerns,  such  as  preferred  share  schemes,
leasing schemes, and derivative transactions.

While these topics remain  a  subject  of  concern,  the  National  Treasury
believes that company reorganisation relief is necessary to  facilitate  the
restructuring  of  financial  institutions  so   as   to   ensure   a   more
internationally competitive and vibrant financial services sector.

The second major topic  for  reform  contained  in  the  Bill  involves  the
taxation of foreign currency. Foreign currency issues  arise  as  a  natural
consequence of the newly introduced worldwide tax system and South  Africa's
increased participation in the global  economy.  Foreign-earned  income  and
losses must be translated into rands for purposes  of  calculating  the  tax
thereon.

Foreign currency issues also arise in terms  of  foreign  investments.  Many
taxpayers generate substantial gains  and  losses  by  speculating  for  and
against the currency. This form of activity generates economic  wealth  just
like all other forms of investment wealth.

The  Revenue  Laws   Amendment   Bill   clarifies   many   ambiguities   and
inconsistencies in the foreign currency arena. These problems  have  emerged
because the rules relating to foreign currency  have  been  added  piecemeal
over the years dating as far back as 1993.  The  result  was  an  incoherent
array of rules that left many perplexed, with  others  seeking  avenues  for
tax avoidance.

The Bill seeks to translate all foreign income and loss into rands  under  a
unified averaging regime. Under this average  regime  taxpayers  can  either
convert all foreign income and loss into rands, utilising a  simple  average
or a weighted average, whichever they desire, as long as they use  the  same
system for all income and loss  throughout  the  same  taxable  year.  Also,
taxpayers can elect this averaging on a  daily,  weekly  or  monthly  basis.
This averaging system clearly means that Government is an equal  partner  to
changes in the value of the rand.

I would like to assure the House that the taxation of currency  speculation,
already a subject of  change  over  the  last  two  years,  was  streamlined
consistent with our overall policy. Taxpayers with liquid foreign  portfolio
investmests remain fully subject to tax on their currency gains  and  losses
with respect to those investments. Other assets are ignored.

This balanced approach ensures that businesses remain competitive while  not
being  given  an  artificial  incentive  to  enter  into  foreign   currency
speculation.  Limited  taxation  of  these   gains   also   ensures   easier
enforcement and compliance. For instance, the new regime wholly ignores  the
currency  gains  stemming  from  private  travel  and  comparable   personal
expenditure.  Such  gains  are  time-consuming  to  process,   tedious   for
compliance and generate little real Government revenue.

The Revenue Laws Amendment Bill further seeks to resolve some  long-standing
administrative problems that have emerged over the  past  two  years.  These
issues involve business travel and the taxation of foreign diplomats.

Under prior law, taxpayers could disregard advanced lump  sum  domestic  and
foreign travel allowances for purposes of their tax calculations,  if  those
sums  fell  within  specified  monetary  thresholds.  These  rules   allowed
taxpayers to disregard any tax on these sums  without  the  use  of  tedious
receipts which were difficult for taxpayers to  maintain  and  wasteful  for
Sars to review. I am sure a lot of members will be aware of this.

All that was needed was proof of actual travel. Problems had arisen of  late
with these advances because the monetary thresholds had become obsolete  and
wholly insufficient to cover rising  domestic  and  international  costs  of
travel.

The Revenue Laws Amendment Bill modifies these thresholds  by  leaving  them
to be periodically fixed  by  Government  stipulation  in  the  Gazette.  As
announced at the parliamentary hearings, these advances are currently  fixed
at $190 for foreign travel, R173 for  domestic  travel  to  the  extent  the
advance covers meals  and  incidental  subsistence,  and  R53  for  advances
covering only subsistence.

The taxation of diplomats had also become an issue over the past few  years.
As a matter of  legal  interpretation  and  administration,  Sars  correctly
applied the law  by  asserting  that  all  foreign  allowances  received  by
diplomats were subject to tax. However, full debate on  the  matter  reveals
that the law itself  needs  change.  No  policy  reason  exists  for  taxing
diplomats  on  their  foreign-related  allowances.  It  is  well  recognised
internationally that diplomats fall within their own  sui  generis  category
of taxation, given the unique demands  of  their  tasks.  The  Revenue  Laws
Amendment Bill accordingly exempts  these  foreign-related  allowances.  Our
diplomats  can  now  operate  free  from  tax  at  their  foreign  posts  as
originally intended.

Like all tax bills, the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill  is  not  entirely  free
from controversy. These areas of controversy fall into two  categories.  One
is issues of process, and the other, rules to prevent avoidance of  transfer
duty.

On issues of process, some practitioners have criticised the  Bill  for  its
volume. What these  tax  practitioners  fail  to  recognise  is  that  these
changes were largely designed to assist taxpayers at their  own  insistence.
Indeed,  many  of  the  practitioners  at  the  parliamentary  hearings  who
complained about  the  volume  of  changes  simultaneously  asked  for  even
greater change  and  tax  relief.  These  comments  seeking  greater  change
amounted to over half of the requests  submitted.  Surely  taxpayers  cannot
have it both ways - they either want change or they do not. They cannot  ask
Government to make changes in their favour and then  condemn  Government  on
the grounds that the level of change is too much to handle.

In terms of the process some practitioners  criticised  Government  for  its
failure to provide timely consultation prior to the parliamentary  hearings.
Government had admittedly hoped to provide for more  time  in  this  regard,
but was effectively caught between ``a rock and a hard  place''.  Government
had essentially two choices - either to act now at the  insistence  of  many
taxpayers  so  they  could  move  forward  with  their  legitimate  business
transactions, or delay the relief until next year  in  favour  of  a  longer
period for comment.

Government  ultimately  believed  that  immediate  relief  best  served  the
economic needs of the country. We reiterate our belief, as espoused  in  the
2002 Budget Review, that  South  Africa's  tax  policy  ultimately  needs  a
period of consolidation. With the main base-broadening  objectives  achieved
during the past two years, the volume of future tax Bills can be reduced  in
favour of more in-depth consultation.

On the issue of transfer duty avoidance, as announced  in  the  2002  Budget
Review,  Government  had  become  increasingly  concerned  about  techniques
employed to artificially avoid the transfer duty on the sale of  residential
and holiday homes. These avoidance techniques unnecessarily narrow  the  tax
base,  thereby  increasing  the  rate  for  taxpayers  who  transfer   their
residential  properties  without  such  artificial   ploys.   Clearly   this
avoidance has become a matter of equity and was in urgent need of reform.

Prior to the  Bill,  many  taxpayers  were  previously  able  to  avoid  the
transfer of duty by placing ownership of that residential  property  into  a
company or a trust. These taxpayers would then  sell  the  shares  or  trust
interests free of any transfer duty that would otherwise  have  applied  had
that residential property been sold directly.

The Bill terminates this practice by imposing the transfer duty despite  the
existence of these company and  trust  structures.  No  legitimate  economic
reason exists for these forms of property to be owned by a company or  trust
when most home owners would  otherwise  hold  these  residential  properties
directly.

I would like to conclude by thanking everyone involved  in  the  preparation
of this Bill, including members within Sars,  the  National  Treasury's  tax
policy unit, parliamentary members within the Select Committee  on  Finance,
and interested parties commenting constructively on the  Bill.  Once  again,
the open, transparent nature of the  deliberation  process  only  serves  to
improve the overall quality of tax legislation. [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson,  Deputy  Minister  and  hon  members,  in  the
normal course of managing a tax  system  it  is  necessary  periodically  to
revise, clarify and streamline the tax  laws.  The  Revenue  Laws  Amendment
Bill of 2002 can best be viewed in that light.
The Bill provides a number of technical corrections and clarifications,  and
while it moves tax policy forward in a number of areas, it does not  reverse
the  prior  policies.  As  such,  the  Bill  maintains  the  continuity  and
predictability of the tax environment in South Africa, supporting  a  stable
and transparent macroeconomic framework that provides the basis for  growth,
job creation and development.

In the light of the considerable extent of tax  changes  in  many  countries
undergoing tax reform, the proposed Bill follows the natural course  of  tax
reform, which requires ongoing clarification and fine-tuning, in  line  with
the  dynamic  behaviour  of  taxpayers  and  the  evolution   of   the   tax
environment.

Most of the proposed amendments are  straightforward  and  noncontroversial,
involving  only  the  clarification  of  wording  or  the   ironing-out   of
ambiguities. It is  not  necessary  to  elaborate  on  this.  Amongst  other
things, the Bill attempts to  bring  tax  legislation  in  line  with  other
legislation and to scrap provisions which have become obsolete.

I will restrict my comments to areas of particular note. First of  all,  the
amendment of section 104 of Act 58 of 1962 increases  the  maximum  term  of
imprisonment for a conviction under the Act  for  evading  tax  with  intent
from two years to five years. This is in line with international  norms  and
standards. For instance, conviction in the United  States  and  Germany  can
lead to prison terms of up to five years and in South Korea of up  to  seven
years.

Similarly, the amendment of section 75  of  the  Income  Tax  Act  of  1962,
increasing the maximum penalty from 18 to 24 months,  not  only  brings  the
Act in line with the Valued-Added Tax Act of 1991, but also aims to  further
improve tax compliance by  raising  the  cost  of  tax  evasion.  This  will
benefit all law-abiding taxpayers.

In addition, the proposed Bill closes loopholes  that  have  undermined  the
horizontal equity of the tax system,  for  instance  an  individual  can  no
longer avoid transfer duty by holding fixed property  in  a  company,  close
corporation or trust. The  intention  to  address  this  problem  was  first
articulated by the  Minister  of  Finance  when  he  tabled  the  Budget  in
February 2002.

The proposed amendments concerning  corporate  reorganisations  clarify  tax
law in respect of such events, lowering transaction costs and fostering  tax
certainty. In particular, the rules  regarding  financial  institutions  are
substantially relaxed. Nevertheless, the problem of the  low  effective  tax
rates  paid  by  some  financial  institutions,  rooted  in   the   use   of
preferential listing and derivatives,  is  still  a  matter  of  significant
concern. We support the ongoing work in this regard.

The substituted Part III of Chapter 2 of the Income Tax Act  provides  clear
rules  that  address  company  formations,   share-for-share   transactions,
amalgamation  transactions,  and  intragroup,  unbundling  and   liquidation
transactions. These amendments ensure that tax  provisions  clearly  reflect
the underlining guiding principles.

The introduction of the concept of an allowance  asset  facilitates  company
formation by enabling the bundled  transfer  of  an  asset  along  with  its
associated allowances and deductions. This also applies in respect of share-
for-share   transactions,   amalgamations,   intragroup   transactions   and
liquidation distributions. In effect, allowance assets allow the  transferee
to step into the shoes of the transferer,  clarifying  and  simplifying  the
treatment of the capital allowance. The transferer and  the  transferee  are
deemed to be one and the same with respect to the transfer of these assets.

The  amendments  include  provisions  to   deter   transactions   structured
primarily for the purpose of  avoiding  tax.  For  instance,  if  a  company
receiving a transferred asset disposes of that asset within 18  months,  the
proposed  rules  restrict  the  gains  resulting  from  the  disposal.  This
provision discourages taxpayers from shifting  built-in  gains  assets  into
companies with excess losses with the  intention  of  immediately  reselling
the assets purely for tax avoidance purposes.

The new corporate restructuring provisions also relax  the  restrictions  on
the tax-neutral transfer of financial instruments. In order to effect  this,
the amendments introduce the concept  of  a  domestic  financial  instrument
holding company. Generally, the transfer of financial  assets  or  companies
primarily  consisting  of  financial  assets   is   unacceptable.   However,
exceptions are made for debts in respect of goods sold or services  rendered
by that company where the amount of the  transaction  was  included  in  the
income of that company and the debt is an integral part  of  that  company's
business.  Further  exceptions  apply   to   certain   regulated   financial
institutions.

There are a number of amendments which I will  not  delve  into  because  of
time constraints. I am just going to highlight what are in my view  critical
issues. The proposed Bill includes a number of  provisions  that  deal  with
exchange rate calculations. While it may appear that there  is  a  trade-off
between complexity and equity,  the  need  for  a  consistent  framework  is
apparent. Too much flexibility in the choice of  exchange  rate  calculation
increases the scope for tax manipulation and undermines tax efficiency.

The proposed Bill  articulates  a  balanced  compromise,  using  an  average
exchange rate translation rule that shares the  risk  between  the  taxpayer
and the fiscus. By allowing for the use of an averaging rate  determined  by
banking institutions and the choice of daily, weekly or  monthly  averaging,
the burden of compliance is reduced.

The introduction of a new section 50A allows  the  establishment  of  border
posts jointly administered by the Commissioner of  the  SA  Revenue  Service
and the  customs  authority  of  a  neighbouring  state.  This  co-operative
arrangement depends  on  the  establishment  of  an  agreement  between  the
Republic of South Africa and the adjoining  state.  The  amendment  supports
the SADC protocol and will generate practical benefits in terms of  reducing
the  administrative  burden  of  customs  and  excise  taxes  on  both   the
importer/exporter and the respective governments.

In closing, it is worth noting that while the  time  available  for  comment
was unfortunately short, at the time  of  presentation  both  Sars  and  the
National Treasury indicated that in some instances where they had  consulted
stakeholders, some of the documents had been leaked.  That  compromised  the
process of appropriate consultation.

Most of the proposed changes favour the taxpayer and  result  from  comments
from and lobbying by taxpayers, as the Deputy Minister said.  In  fact,  the
processes of engagement on these tax changes have been substantially  longer
than the formal period  provided  for  comment.  It  is  worth  noting  that
approximately 40 persons had time to submit comments and  criticism  to  the
National Treasury, which in turn comprehensively addressed  the  issues  and
relevant concerns and brought them back to the committee.

I therefore call upon this House to vote in  favour  of  this  Bill,  noting
that it is a section 77 Bill. [Applause.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, Deputy Minister and members,  it  is  said  that
the Revenue Laws  Amendment  Bill  contains  mere  technical  amendments  or
corrections to major tax policy changes introduced last year. However,  this
is not the case, as Saica pointed out  in  its  submission.  While  industry
players  were  under  the  impression  that  this  year  would  be  one   of
consolidation, thereby contributing to tax certainty,  the  Bill  before  us
today introduces considerable change.

The Bill brings changes in the areas of  the  resident  basis  of  taxation;
corporate  reorganisation  rules  to  cater  for  corporate   restructuring,
mergers and acquisitions; taxation of capital profit  liquidation;  currency
rules for capital gains tax; source rules for capital gains tax, which  were
strangely  omitted  from  the  previous  legislation;  a  number  of   other
provisions related to capital gains tax, including  the  alteration  of  the
definition  of  ``controlled  foreign  entity''  to   ``controlled   foreign
company'' to restrict its scope; and customs and excise amendments.

The changes before us today add  fuel  to  the  fire  of  those  who  warned
against the administrative complexity  of  capital  gains  tax,  or  CGT,  a
complexity that implies substantive change and resultant tax uncertainty.

While these changes do not alter policy, they are  considerable  alterations
and not merely technical corrections, as National Treasury  maintains.  Both
Saica and PriceWaterhouseCoopers raised this point in their submissions,  in
which they raised  concern  about  tax  certainty,  and  therefore  business
certainty, in the context of all these changes. In Saica's words:


  We do not believe that the current set of proposed amendments can  merely
  be seen as of a textual nature, as there are a  number  of  changes  that
  will have a marked impact in the tax planning and offshore  structure  of
  South African multinationals.

Indeed, the question arises whether some of the new tax  changes  themselves
constitute a clear disincentive to offshore listings.

What further ought to be clear, is that those who opposed  policy  decisions
on the introduction of capital gains tax  and/or  the  change  from  source-
based taxation  to  residence-based  taxation  will  find  it  difficult  to
support legislation that tinkers at the margins of complexity  and  of  what
are considered to be bad tax policy choices for South Africa.

The administrative complexity of  the  major  tax  reform  South  Africa  is
undertaking speaks clearly from the voluminous Bill we  consider  today  and
its numerous retrospective provisions  -  always  bad  law  irrespective  of
whether it  acts  to  the  benefit  of  taxpayers,  as  it  perpetuates  tax
uncertainty. In addition, areas of uncertainty remain, despite  the  changes
in lieu of corporate reorganisations, as  consequential  amendments  to  the
UST and VAT Acts will be required due to the alterations  to  the  corporate
reorganisation rules, new policy decisions that  will  have  to  wait  until
budget time.

While many industry players are favourably inclined to aspects of the  Bill,
they all raised concerns about the retroactivity question at its  heart.  As
Sacob stated in their submission:


  Retrospective taxation measures are bad measures in the sense  that  they
  generate a high level of uncertainty for both business and  taxpayers  in
  general. It is a legislative device that is and has been strongly opposed
  by Sacob.

In their  submission  to  the  portfolio  committee,  PriceWaterhouseCoopers
raised the  legitimate  question  on  whether  the  time  allocated  to  the
committee  to  consider  a  Bill  of  this  magnitude  and  complexity   was
sufficient for the committee to adequately fulfil its role. Indeed, all  the
submissions raised  the  question  of  insufficient  time  for  comment  and
engagement, and although Parliament cannot amend the  tax  codes  it  should
have more time to engage with the issues, with technical assistance for  the
finance committee to be in a position to engage on  an  equal  footing  with
tax policy advisers in both the Treasury and Sars.

We in the select committee had the same  problem  to  engage  properly  with
such a technical and thick Bill.  Whether  we  were  really  in  a  position
adequately to engage with the Bill before us is a question  each  member  of
the committee must honestly ask himself or herself.

The Bill introduces a new concept of liability which will have  far-reaching
consequences and which the DP believes to be problematic. In  terms  of  tax
liability, the concept of joint  and  several  liability  is  a  significant
departure  from  taxpayers  being  liable  for  their  own  tax  only,   and
represents a dangerous precedent, as many submissions pointed out.

In conclusion, in considering supporting or  opposing  the  Bill,  competing
considerations arise. There is no doubt that the  Bill  seeks  to  bring  at
least greater clarity, particularly  in  crucial  areas  such  as  corporate
reorganisations, residence-based taxation, and capital gains tax.  There  is
further no doubt that many provisions would act to the potential benefit  of
the taxpayer. However, this has to be seen against  the  broader  background
that the Bill before us furthers tax policy decisions that were not seen  by
the DP to be in the interests and responsive to the  needs  of  an  emerging
market economy such as South  Africa's.  These  are  policy  decisions  that
bring great administrative complexity  and  resultant  tax  uncertainty,  as
this Bill attests. The Bill implements policy decisions that in  some  areas
were not sufficiently thought through  or  articulated  and  now  result  in
undesirable retroactive provisions, with  the  biggest  issue  in  the  Bill
being the question of effective dates.

For all these reasons, the DP cannot support this Bill.

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, agb Adjunkminister  van  Finansies  en  kollegas,
die instrumente wat nodig is vir die  insameling  van  die  fondse  wat  die
keiser toekom, is dinamies en moet voortdurend aangepas word  ten  einde  te
verseker dat vermydingsmoontlikhede  tot  die  minimum  beperk  word  en  om
ontduiking natuurlik so onaantreklik moontlik te maak. Die  dinamika  spruit
voort uit die feit dat belastingwetgewing  deurlopend  beïnvloed  word  deur
veranderings wat  ook  op  ander  terreine  plaasvind.  Dit  veroorsaak  dat
wysigings feitlik jaarliks aan die belastingverwante wette  aangebring  word
en vanjaar  is  nie  'n  uitsondering  op  dié  reël  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister of Finance and  colleagues,
the instruments required for the collection of funds that are due to  Caesar
dynamic and must continually be adjusted to ensure  that  possibilities  for
avoidance are limited to the minimum and to render evasion  as  unattractive
as possible. These dynamics arise from the fact  that  taxation  legislation
is continually being influenced by changes  taking  place  in  other  areas.
This causes amendments to be made to taxation  legislation  almost  annually
and this year is no exception to this rule.]

Chairperson,  the  amendments  introduced  to  inter  alia  the   Marketable
Securities Act, 1948; the Transfer Duty Act,  1949;  the  Estate  Duty  Act,
1955; the Income Tax Act, 1962; the Customs and Excise Act,  1964;  and  the
Stamp Duties Act, 1968 are technical  and  mostly  of  a  consequential  and
textual nature.

The fact that this Revenue Laws Amendment Bill,  2002,  includes  amendments
to the Revenue Laws Amendment Acts 2000 and 2001,  as  well  as  the  Second
Revenue Laws Amendment Act, 2001, underscores the dynamic  nature  of  South
Africa's taxation laws  that  I  have  already  alluded  to  in  my  opening
remarks.

The limited speaking time allocated to me for this debate does not allow  me
even to attempt a detailed review of every amendment contained  in  a  total
of 130 clauses tabled today. I will therefore refer to only  one  of  these;
though not necessarily the most important,  it  is  certainly  an  amendment
that will bring relief to some of our compatriots.

The amendment I am referring to is contained  in  clause  11  of  the  Bill,
where it proposes the amendment of section 8 of the Income  Tax  Act,  1962,
by the addition  in  subsection  (1)  to  paragraph  (a)  of  the  following
subparagraph, and I quote:


  ... to exclude from tax, the  allowance  benefits  and  privileges  of  a
  person stationed outside the Republic and employed  by  the  national  or
  provincial entity.

In layman's language this means that  South  Africa's  diplomatic  personnel
stationed abroad will no longer be required to pay  tax  on  the  allowances
and benefits portion of their foreign service salaries. They will still  pay
tax on the basic salary, but the portion that allows  them  to  be  able  to
maintain a reasonable standard of living  abroad,  with  the  high  cost  of
living prevailing in the countries where they are  stationed,  will  not  be
taxed.

Voorsitter, ek het  self  vir  'n  groot  deel  van  my  diensbare  lewe  in
buitelandse  missies  van  Suid-Afrika  gedien  en  ek  kan  dit   uit   eie
ondervinding kategories stel dat dit vir geen  staatsamptenaar  moontlik  is
om 'n redelike lewenstandaard in enige van die wêreldstede op  slegs  sy  of
haar Suid-Afrikaanse salaris te handhaaf nie - nie wanneer hy of sy  kinders
daarop skool moet hou, gereeld  mense  op  'n  hoë  diplomatieke  vlak  moet
onthaal, en hul kleredrag van so 'n hoeveelheid en  gehalte  moet  wees  dat
hulle hul verteenwoordigingspligte kan nakom sonder om 'n  verleentheid  vir
Suid-Afrika of ons President te wees nie.

Dit is om dié rede dat Suid-Afrika se diplomate, in  lyn  met  die  praktyke
wat  internasionaal  toegepas  word,  'n  buitelandse  dienstoelaag  ontvang
waarop hulle tot onlangs geen belastings  betaal  het  nie.  Daarom  is  die
besluit verlede jaar dat Suid-Afrikaanse diplomate inkomstebelasting op  hul
toelaes moet betaal, met skok en verontwaardiging ontvang. En dit is  daarom
verblydend  dat  dié  oënskynlik  ondeurdagte  besluit  nou  met  die  reeds
genoemde wysiging reggestel is.
Die Nuwe NP steun hierdie wetsontwerp. [Applous.] (Translation of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, I myself served in foreign missions  of  South  Africa  for  a
large part of my working life and I can  state  categorically  from  my  own
experience that it is impossible  for  any  public  servant  to  maintain  a
reasonable standard of living in any of the world's cities on  only  his  or
her South African salary - not when he  or  she  has  to  keep  children  at
school, regularly has to entertain people at a high  diplomatic  level,  and
their clothes have to be of such quantity and quality  that  they  can  meet
their representational needs without being an embarrassment to South  Africa
or our President.

It is for this reason that South Africa's diplomats, in line with  practices
that are applied internationally, receive a diplomatic  allowance  on  which
they until recently had not paid any  taxes.  Therefore  the  decision  last
year that South African diplomats must  pay  tax  on  their  allowances  was
received with shock and indignation. And it  is  therefore  heartening  that
this apparently ill-considered decision is now being rectified by  means  of
the aforementioned legislation.

The New NP supports this Bill. [Applause.]]

Mr T B TAABE: Mr Chairperson, it is my pleasure once  again  to  share  with
members  a  few  highlights  of  the  Revenue  Laws  Amendment  Bill,  2002,
currently before this House. I do not wish to run  the  risk  of  having  to
repeat what the Deputy Minister and also the chairperson  of  the  committee
has said before this House this afternoon, but, in  the  words  of  the  hon
Tlhagale in one of the debates yesterday, I probably would want to  stay  on
the periphery myself this afternoon. [Laughter.] I shall confine  myself  to
the residence-based worldwide system of taxation, which  basically  required
minor technical corrections in this Bill.

As hon members would know, residence-based taxation was introduced  in  2000
and deals with the taxation of income of residents from foreign sources.  In
terms of the current legislation, a person is  a  resident  for  payment  of
income tax if such a person is physically  present  in  the  country  for  a
period exceeding 91 days in one financial year, or 91 days during the  three
preceding years, or for 549 days aggregate during those preceding years.

The issue raised is whether persons in transit through  South  Africa,  that
is, in transit between two places outside the country, should be treated  as
being physically present.

The  current  Revenue  Laws  Amendment  Bill  amends   the   definition   of
``resident'' specifically to exclude  days  that  a  person  is  in  transit
through South Africa between two places outside  South  Africa,  where  that
person does not formally enter the Republic through a port of  entry;  or  a
regular commuter to and from South Africa who has his or her  main  dwelling
outside the country and is also not employed nor carries on any business  in
South Africa.

One of the major strengths of this legislation is  therefore  that  it  will
close the transfer duty gaps in the existing legislation, in the sense  that
individuals  who  have  bought  homes  in  the  name  of  a  company,  close
corporation or trust can no longer take advantage of tax benefits  with  the
latest amendments to South Africa's tax regime.

Property owners will be obliged to pay transfer duty  of  10%  each  time  a
company  changes  hands.  Also,  people  who  have  bought   homes   through
companies, trusts and close corporations can be expected to  be  subject  to
capital gains tax on any profit that they make when they sell the property.

This legislation therefore reflects  the  strategic  approach  and  dominant
strategy of the SA Revenue Service of widening the tax  net  to  effectively
close loopholes and deter tax avoidance schemes.

The   Bill   further   regulates   provisions    relating    to    corporate
reorganisations. The Bill aims to reduce the tax  liability  when  corporate
restructuring  takes  place.  Tax   free   corporate   reorganisations   are
consistent with international practice, thereby keeping  the  South  African
tax system internationally competitive. Tax free corporate  reorganisations,
as the hon the Deputy Chairperson also knows from  the  discussions  flowing
from the briefings by the Treasury, promote on-shore restructuring as well.

The Bill before us makes a new proposal  with  regard  to  mining  which  is
critical for the economy of South Africa. In this case, taxpayers  that  are
subject to tax on their foreign income may receive a rebate, that is, a  tax
credit for foreign taxes paid.  This  rebate  is  a  key  component  in  any
worldwide tax system.

Our existing tax regime allows a foreign tax credit to  be  granted  against
South African tax, payable on any  income  where  a  resident  is  taxed  in
another country on that same income. It is therefore crucial  to  note  that
this  Bill  proposes  that  no  foreign  tax  credit  be  allowed  in  these
instances, as it  is  effectively  income  attributable  to  South  Africa's
mining rights or services in respect of which South  Africa  has  the  first
right to tax. What this means is that no foreign tax credit will be  allowed
in respect of foreign taxes paid on those amounts.

It is also important to  note  that  clause  92  of  this  Bill  effectively
excludes capital gains tax liability when a taxpayer is rewarded for  claims
submitted for land restitution in terms of the Restitution  of  Land  Rights
Act of 1994.

When we view the entire tax regime of our country, it is clearly  consistent
and compatible with our national priorities, in the sense that the  existing
tax laws are very labour friendly. I had hoped that I  could  expand  a  bit
more on the provisions in this Bill as they relate to incentives for  skills
training and employment, but I will not do so because of  time  constraints.
But I will just say, for  the  benefit  of  members,  that  the  learnership
allowance is catered for in this Bill. The Bill allows firms  an  additional
deduction when they enter into  a  learnership  agreement  and  the  learner
successfully completes the learnership programme.

Hon members would know that to date about  285  new  learnership  programmes
have been registered with the Department of Labour. I will not go  into  the
details of the benefits for  an  employer  entering  learnership  agreements
with learners already employed by  the  employer  or  with  those  who  were
previously unemployed. However, I think it is important to mention the  kind
of progress we have made in this area.

In conclusion, the design of our existing tax regime  favours  all  classes,
in the sense that it aims to become a positive sum  where  all  segments  of
our  communities  benefit.  I  must  also  say  that   as   elected   public
representatives  we  have  indeed  taken  the  route  of  appealing  to  our
citizens' moral fabric to pay their taxes. In this way we will  be  able  to
push back the frontiers of poverty, as the hon the Deputy President said  in
the House yesterday, and in the process extend the frontiers of prosperity.

The ANC supports  this  Bill  and  we  want  to  implore  members  of  other
political parties to do so too, except, obviously, the right-wing  political
formations. [Laughter.] In any event, the  kind  of  noise  they  have  been
making in this Chamber throughout this year has never really  worried  those
of us who belong to this gigantic army of the African  people,  the  ANC.  I
can only say that these kinds of comments were to  me,  more  than  anything
else, bordering on  sheer  political  naiveté  if  not  myopia.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE:  Chairperson,  there  is  not  much  to  say
except to thank members for their participation and interest in the  matters
raised.

Perhaps I can pick up on a few  points.  The  issue  has  been  raised  that
whilst we maintain that we have been making a lot of  technical  corrections
and changes, in actual fact we have introduced substantial changes. I  would
maintain that  it  is  still  our  view  that  we  have  largely  used  this
legislation  to  effect  a  lot  of  corrections  and  clarifications  where
practice has shown us that we needed to move in a particular direction.
One will find, for example, that in some  areas  in  earlier  amendments  or
policy changes we have introduced in the  past,  we  had  taken  a  cautious
approach because we wanted to gain better insight from experience. With  the
benefit of that experience, we are now able to  effect  further  changes  in
that direction. We are therefore of the view that this  is  largely  a  Bill
through which we have tried to clarify, simplify and make corrections.

Of course, one  has  to  understand  that  matters  around  tax  are  always
controversial. They are matters around which we can never  really  hope  for
100% consensus. It may well be that there  is  residual  opposition  to  the
fact that we introduced capital gains tax, which is a policy choice that  we
made for reasons of equity. I want to emphasise that for reasons  of  equity
we chose the route of capital gains  tax.  It  cannot  be  acceptable  in  a
country with the  kinds  of  challenges  that  South  Africa  has,  to  have
everyone else paying their dues whereas those who are most able to pay  have
all sorts of avenues through which they avoid paying tax.  It  is  therefore
an equity measure. We do not apologise for it, because the issue  of  equity
is one of the major challenges confronting us in South Africa today. It  may
well be that there is residual opposition to that.

We are constantly striving to make sure that our tax law is simple and  that
it enhances efficiency in the economy. We would maintain that we are  moving
along that route.

On the issue of the taxation of  the  allowances  of  foreign  diplomats,  I
would like to say to the hon Conroy that I do not think it  was  so  much  a
decision to tax foreign diplomats, but rather  the  unintended  consequences
of changes that were made some years ago. We were trying to deal with  abuse
in the system, where people would hide the true income they  got  through  a
whole array of allowances. An unintended consequence of  that  was  that  it
impacted on the treatment of the allowances that foreign diplomats  get.  It
is a matter that we have now dealt with and we have decided that  we  should
use this legislation to correct that.
I thank all members. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                          GAS REGULATOR LEVIES BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Mr  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  ladies  and
gentlemen, the gas industry in our democracy is expected to expand over  the
next two  decades.  Therefore,  it  is  important  for  this  sector  to  be
regulated in order to facilitate growth and the orderly development  of  the
gas industry that will contribute productively to our economic growth.  This
Bill is therefore based on this premise.

Last year we passed the Gas Act, Act 48 of  2001,  which  provided  for  the
establishment of  the  Gas  Regulator,  which  will  be  the  custodian  and
enforcer of the national regulatory framework for the piped gas industry.

This Bill empowers the Gas Regulator to impose a levy on any gas entering  a
facility licensed in terms of the Gas Act, from its point of production,  or
the border in the case of importation, as well as specifying  various  terms
and conditions relating to the levy's imposition. The aim of the levy is  to
fund the establishment and operation of the Gas Regulator.

The Bill aims for the Gas  Regulator  to  impose  those  levies  subject  to
consultation and ministerial approval.  This  means  that  the  Minister  of
Minerals and Energy and the Minister of Finance can  approve  or  disapprove
the imposition or variation of levies and the determination of  interest  on
overdue levies and recommend alternatives.

This Bill further requires the Gas Regulator to submit an annual budget  and
business plan to the Minister  of  Minerals  and  Energy.  In  addition,  it
requires that the performance of the Gas Regulator be  assessed  every  five
years.

Last but not least, this Bill provides for the levies to be imposed  on  the
gas entering transmission or distribution  pipelines,  rather  than  at  the
point  of   consumption,   for   reasons   of   administrative   efficiency,
international best practice and the Government policy of taxing at source.

Finally,  my  committee  recommends  that  the  House   passes   the   Bill.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE ON MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING AMONG MEMBER GOVERNMENTS OF EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN ANTI-
                       MONEY LAUNDERING GROUP AND RSA

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, the proposal to establish a regional  anti-money
laundering group in Africa was first  recommended  at  a  workshop  held  in
South Africa in October 1995. The Eastern and  Southern  African  Anti-Money
Laundering Group, or the ESAAMLG, was launched at a meeting of ministers  in
Tanzania in 1999. [Interjections.]

Chairperson, I would like to ask the hon Moosa not to  distract  me  please,
and to switch off his screen.

Nine countries  from  the  Commonwealth  were  represented  at  the  launch,
including South Africa.  The  launch  meeting  agreed  on  a  memorandum  of
understanding to establish the group  as  well  as  the  objectives  of  the
group. It also agreed that once seven countries had signed  the  memorandum,
the group would  be  formally  established.  Observers  from  the  Financial
Action Task Force, or the FATF; the Caribbean Financial Action  Task  Force,
or the CFATF; and the Commonwealth secretariat were also present.

The Republics of Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,  Namibia,  Seychelles
and Uganda, and the United Republic of Tanzania  signed  the  memorandum  of
understanding, followed more recently  by  the  Kingdom  of  Swaziland.  The
Minister of Finance signed the memorandum  of  understanding  in  July  2002
after  approval  by  Cabinet.  South  Africa's  membership  application  was
accepted at an ESAAMLG council of ministers meeting in August 2002.

The objectives of  the  ESAAMLG  are  to  make  a  political  commitment  to
implementing  the  FATF  standards;  to   adopt   and   implement   the   40
recommendations of the  FATF  by  enabling  the  necessary  legislation  and
deployment of capacity; to  apply  anti-money  laundering  measures  to  all
serious  crimes;  and  to  implement  any  other   measures   contained   in
multilateral agreements. All member  countries  should  establish  financial
intelligence units. All member  countries  should  agree  to  undergo  self-
assessments and mutual evaluations of their  extent  of  compliance  to  the
FATF/ESAAMLG  standards.  This  applies  to  their  legislation,   financial
intelligence and law enforcement capacity.
The memorandum establishes the structure of the ESAAMLG, which is  comprised
of  a  ministerial  council,  a  task  force  of  senior  officials  and   a
secretariat. Three subcommittees have been established, namely  legislation,
law enforcement and financial. These are not yet functioning.

The memorandum provides for co-operating and supporting nations who are  not
members of the group but express their support for  the  objectives  of  the
group. It  also  provides  for  observer  countries  or  organisations.  The
initial observers to the group are  the  Commonwealth  secretariat,  the  UN
Global Programme against Money Laundering, the Financial Action  Task  Force
secretariat, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Interpol,  the
World Customs Organisation,  the  African  Development  Bank,  the  Southern
African Development Community secretariat, the  Common  Market  for  Eastern
and Southern Africa secretariat, the East African Community secretariat  and
the East African Development Bank.

The  ESAAMLG  has  initiated  a  process  to  start  evaluations  of  member
countries to be conducted by their peers or  fellow  members.  South  Africa
has volunteered to undergo such a mutual  evaluation  process.  Training  to
equip evaluators will be provided by a combined FATF/ESAAMLG  team  in  late
January next year. South Africa has been approached to  host  this  training
programme. It is expected that this mutual evaluation will be  conducted  in
March 2003.

This evaluation process is different from FATF-style assessments,  which  in
future will be conducted according to the new assessment  methodology  which
was adopted by the FATF at its recent plenary meeting in October  in  Paris,
France. This methodology will include an assessment  of  measures  taken  to
combat terrorist financing. In addition, the IMF and  World  Bank  have  now
been  accepted  as  institutions  which  may  undertake  such   assessments,
although the law enforcement component thereof  will  remain  solely  within
the ambit of the FATF. South Africa will undergo such an assessment in  late
February or early March 2003. The financial implication for South Africa  is
for the payment of an annual membership fee of US$20 000.

We hereby ask all members of the House to support and adopt  the  report  of
the Select Committee on Finance. [Applause.]

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - RSA/UK CONVENTION
   FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION WITH
                RESPECT TO TAXES ON INCOME AND CAPITAL GAINS

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, hon  Deputy  Minister  of  Finance,  colleagues,
international juridical double taxation can  be  generally  defined  as  the
imposition of comparable taxes in two or more states on  the  same  taxpayer
in respect of the same subject and for identical periods.

Its harmful effects on the exchange of goods and services, and movements  of
capital, technology and persons are  so  well  known  that  it  is  scarcely
necessary to stress the importance of removing  the  obstacles  that  double
taxation presents to the economic relations between countries.

It has long been recognised that it is  desirable  to  clarify,  standardise
and  confirm  the  fiscal  situation  of  taxpayers  who  are   engaged   in
commercial,  industrial,  financial  or  any  other  activities   in   other
countries through the application by all countries of  common  solutions  to
identical cases of double taxation.

The Council of the Organisation for European Economic  Co-operation  adopted
its first recommendation concerning double taxation in 1955. This was  to  a
large extent due to the work commenced in 1921 by  the  League  of  Nations.
This work led to the drawing  up  in  1928  of  the  first  model  bilateral
convention and to the model conventions  of  Mexico  in  1943  and  that  of
London in 1946, the principles of which were followed with certain  variants
in many of the bilateral conventions concluded or revised during the  period
up to 1955.

The increasing economic interdependence of the member countries of the  OEEC
in the postwar period showed increasingly  and  clearly  the  importance  of
measures  for  preventing  international  double  taxation.  The  need   was
recognised for extending the network of bilateral tax  conventions  and,  at
the same  time,  harmonisation  of  these  conventions  in  accordance  with
uniform principles, definitions, rules  and  methods,  and  agreement  on  a
common interpretation became increasingly desirable.

Experience gained in the negotiation and practical application of  bilateral
conventions; of changes in the  tax  systems  of  different  countries;  the
increase of international fiscal relations; the development of  new  sectors
of business activity; fundamental changes taking place in the ways in  which
cross-border transactions were undertaken;  the  emergence  of  new  complex
business organisations  at  the  international  level;  and  the  increasing
sophistication in tax avoidance and tax evasion methods,  were  all  factors
that contributed to even further refinements of conventions  and  agreements
on double taxation.

With that brief definition and background  history  of  double  taxation,  I
come to the purpose of this statement. The Government  of  the  Republic  of
South Africa and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great  Britain  and
Northern Ireland have expressed their desire to promote and  strengthen  the
economic relations between our two countries by  the  conclusion  of  a  new
convention for the avoidance  of  double  taxation  and  the  prevention  of
fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains.

They have therefore agreed that the convention shall apply  to  all  persons
who are residents of one or both of the contracting states;  that  it  shall
apply to taxes on income and  on  capital  gains  imposed  on  behalf  of  a
contracting state or of its  political  subdivisions,  irrespective  of  the
manner in which they are levied; and that it shall apply  in  particular  in
the case of South Africa to the normal tax, the secondary tax  on  companies
and the withholding tax on companies,  while  in  the  case  of  the  United
Kingdom, it shall apply to the income  tax,  the  corporation  tax  and  the
capital gains tax.

It shall also apply to any identical or substantially similar taxes  imposed
by other contracting states, after the date of signature of the  convention,
in addition to or  in  the  place  of  the  existing  taxes.  The  competent
authorities of the  contracting  states  shall  notify  each  other  of  any
significant changes that have been made in their respective taxation laws.

The main body of the convention consists  of  28  articles,  covering  every
aspect from the various types of taxes included, to the date of  entry  into
force and the termination of the convention. In the  limited  speaking  time
available to me, it will hardly  be  possible  to  deal  with  each  article
individually, nor will it add to my popularity with hon members if I  should
even attempt to bore them with the technical details.

This convention  was  signed  by  the  hon  Trevor  Manuel,  South  Africa's
Minister of Finance, in London on 4  July  2002.  The  Select  Committee  on
Finance has adopted a report which recommends that this  House  should  vote
in favour of the ratification of the convention. I now request  hon  members
to do so. [Applause.]

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - RSA/NEW ZEALAND
 AGREEMENT FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION
                       WITH RESPECT TO TAXES ON INCOME

Mr G A LUCAS: Hon Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister  of  Finance  and  hon
members ...

Motswana a re mojamorago ke kgosi.  Ke  dumela  fa  gompieno  ke  le  kgosi.
[Setshego.] O intshwarele Kgosi Mokoena le dikgosi tse ding. [Setshego.]  [A
Motswana says that one who perseveres and remains  to  the  last  reaps  the
greatest benefits. I believe that today I am  a  chief.  [Laughter.]  Please
bear with me, Kgosi Mokoena and other chiefs. [Laughter.]]

The Government of the Republic of South Africa and  the  government  of  New
Zealand have concluded an agreement for the  avoidance  of  double  taxation
and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income.

It is a practice in most countries for income tax to be imposed both on  the
worldwide income derived by residents of a country and on income derived  by
nonresidents which arises in the country. The effect of  such  a  system  is
that income derived by a resident of one country from a  source  in  another
country is subject to tax in both countries.

As this position clearly discourages foreign investment, it  is  normal  for
countries that have trade relations to conclude double taxation  agreements.
Such agreements commonly provide that income of  a  particular  nature  will
either be taxable in only one of the countries  or  may  be  taxed  in  both
countries, with one of them allowing credit for tax imposed by the other.

This agreement applies to persons who are residents of South Africa and  New
Zealand. The agreement covers the following  areas,  and  I  hope  that  hon
Maloyi will listen attentively because he  might  go  to  New  Zealand  very
soon: income from immovable property; business profits; operation  of  ships
and aircraft; associated enterprises  where,  for  example,  South  Africans
participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital  of
an enterprise physically located in New Zealand  or  vice  versa;  dividends
and interest paid by a company which is a resident of New  Zealand  for  the
purpose of its tax, being  dividends  or  interest  which  are  beneficially
owned by a South African; royalties; alienation  of  property;  income  from
property; directors' fees; entertainment and  sportspersons  -  I  hope  hon
Maloyi is  listening;  pensions  and  annuities;  government  services;  and
payment received by students from sources in New  Zealand  for  purposes  of
education in South Africa and vice versa  -  this  relates  to  those  South
Africans who want to study in New Zealand.

This agreement  is  consistent  with  the  model  of  the  Organisation  for
Economic Co-operation and Development, widely known as the  OECD.  The  OECD
comprises mainly industrialised countries.  For  hon  Maloyi's  information,
South Africa is not a member of the OECD.

I therefore put forward that the House adopts this agreement. [Applause.]

                              FAREWELL SPEECHES

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, on Tuesday, when  the  President
addressed the House, hon members may have  noticed  that  I  was  unable  to
complete my speech. There were two important things that I was going  to  do
at  the  conclusion  of  my  speech.  The  first  was  to  congratulate  you
personally, and in my capacity as  Chief  Whip  of  this  Council,  on  your
appointment as Deputy Chairperson of the Council. I do so now on  behalf  of
the Council.

The second was to tell this House that I am indeed proud to  be  part  of  a
team that is so committed, and conducts its work with so  much  passion  and
pleasure. I think it has been an extraordinary privilege to be part of  this
team. I would like to thank the leadership of this House. Mrs Pandor is  not
here today, but she has very ably led this  House,  and  has  been  a  great
inspiration to all of us. You are now here  with  us,  and  we  remember  Mr
Mushwana for his contributions, and we believe that you will do as  well  in
terms of providing support to Mrs Pandor in leading this institution.

I would also like to thank  all  the  Whips  for  their  support,  both  the
provincial Whips from the ANC, as well as the multiparty Whips. I think  the
co-operation was wonderful  this  year.  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the
chairpersons and members of the House. My special thanks to each member  who
has contributed in one way or another to the success of the  programme  that
we have had this year.

Let us not forget the work of the Secretary of the NCOP,  Lulu,  Lindikhaya,
the table staff Benni and Jodi, the researchers,  the  technical  staff  who
are sitting up there and are assisting  us,  the  administrative  assistants
who are helping us all the time, and our programming staff that  assist  us.
I think we must recognise their contribution.  Overall  it  has  been  their
incredible contribution that has made this year a very successful  year  for
the NCOP.

As we now say goodbye - this is our  last  sitting  -  there  is  a  festive
season ahead of us. We wish members well. Merry Christmas to  those  members
who are going to celebrate Christmas, a happy new year, and  for  those  who
are fasting, a happy Ramadan, and a  happy  Eid  that  follows.  Be  careful
during the festive period. Also for those members of the ANC who  are  going
to have their national conference, I wish them well in that.

Before I conclude, I have this opportunity now to say  farewell  to  a  very
good friend who started with me in 1994: Mohseen Moosa. We  are  aware  that
he is leaving. He has served the Senate and this House with distinction.  He
has very ably chaired the Select Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
Affairs in the first term. He has done  an  excellent  job  and  has  really
excelled this year as chairperson of  the  Select  Committee  on  Trade  and
Industry. He has also served in various other capacities on behalf  of  this
House in terms of rules and in terms of equality legislation.  He  has  also
done his bit in terms of a contribution towards the Constitution.

We will miss his ability as a politician, his legal skills, his sharp  mind,
and his very frequent  mischievousness,  especially  in  terms  of  the  new
technology that we have with  us,  but  we  wish  him  well  in  his  future
pursuits in the private sector, and we do believe  that  he  will  be  in  a
position to make  a  very  meaningful  contribution  in  terms  of  economic
empowerment for those who have been disadvantaged.  We  certainly  wish  him
well.

I have next to me, Mr Renier Schoeman. It is a pleasure to invite  him  here
to our House and to have him present next to us. We would  like  to  extend,
on behalf of the Council, our heartiest congratulations on  his  appointment
as Deputy Minister and on his being part of the  executive.  We  do  believe
that he will have a wonderful working relationship with this House.
Finally, I take this opportunity to say: ``Farewell, go well, my  friends.''
[Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, this time I will do it fair and  well  -  without
any interjections. No individual member, no party, not even all  the  people
assembled here, are the NCOP. The NCOP is an institution that will  continue
to exist long after we have all left. But while  we  are  here,  year  after
year, we as members have the privileged opportunity  to  contribute  to  the
image and the spirit of the NCOP. We had that opportunity again  this  year.
Sometimes we used our unique opportunity wisely  and  positively;  sometimes
we failed to build.

Be that as it may, we go home today with some sadness.  After  all,  despite
political differences, we are a unique club of friends. Our  thanks  to  our
Chairperson, a truly competent and fair person, and to you, the  new  Deputy
Chair: Welcome to the NCOP family. I also express my  thanks  to  the  Chief
Whip, the Deputy Whip, my Eastern Cape Whip and the Whip of  my  party,  the
Chairperson of Committees and Mr Moosa. We appreciate their  hard  work  and
wish them all a well-earned rest.

Let us come back next year, determined to continue to build  our  tradition.
Remember: There is so much bad in the best of us, there is so much  good  in
the worst of us, that it ill behoves any of us to speak bad about  the  rest
of us. May all my hon colleagues enjoy  a  wonderful  Christmas  and  recess
period  with  their  friends  and  families.  May  God  bless  all  members.
[Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter,  ek  wil  ook  graag  namens  die  Nuwe  NP  my
aansluit by die woorde van bedanking aan al die persone wat reeds  deur  die
vorige sprekers genoem is. Natuurlik, die Hoofsweep het homself  nie  genoem
nie, en ons wil ook almal graag vir hom baie dankie sê vir sy harde werk  en
die uitnemendheid waarmee hy sy pligte volvoer het  gedurende  die  afgelope
jaar. Ek wil ook almal wat reeds genoem is, verseker van  ons  opregte  dank
en hoogste waardering vir al die harde werk en goeie diens.

As 'n instelling het ons sonder twyfel oor die afgelope  jaar  vooruitgegaan
en bewys dat die Nasionale Raad van  Provinsies  besig  is  om  'n  absolute
sleutelrol te speel in die  verwesenliking  van  die  ideale  van  ons  jong
demokrasie. Daar is egter steeds ruimte vir verbetering en  harde  werk  wat
vir ons voorlê. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, on behalf of the New NP I would also  like  to
associate myself with the words of thanks conveyed to  all  the  people  who
have already been  mentioned  by  previous  speakers.  The  Chief  Whip,  of
course, did not mention himself, and all of us would also like to thank  him
for his hard work and the outstanding way in which he performed  his  duties
during the past year. I would also like to give  everyone  who  has  already
been mentioned the assurance of our heartfelt thanks and highest regard  for
all the hard work and good service.

As an institution we have without a doubt  made  progress  during  the  past
year and proved that  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  is  playing  an
absolute key role in the realisation of the ideals of our  young  democracy.
However, there is still room for improvement and hard work  lying  ahead  of
us.]

We have, for instance, not  as  yet  succeeded  in  getting  the  provincial
legislatures to be  more  proactive  in  channelling  through  to  us  their
concerns, problems, viewpoints and proposals, as  well  as  those  of  their
electorate in respect of matters  which  should  be  addressed  at  national
level by way of, for example, motions, questions and  legislative  proposals
by permanent delegates.

I also wish  to  thank  Mr  Moosa  for  his  outstanding  services  to  this
institution, and for his friendliness and collegiality over many years,  and
wish him everything of the best  for  the  future.  I  am,  however,  a  bit
worried that now that Mr Mushwana has left us, and Mr Moosa is also  leaving
us, we are running out of lawyers in this House.  I  think  it  is  only  Mr
Surty, Mr Lever and myself that  are  now  left.  Mr  Mkoena  says  he  too.
[Laughter.] I also noticed that I seem to be the only  lawyer  left  in  the
Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Legislative Proposals. I  think  this
should be addressed as soon as possible.

In conclusion, I wish to leave hon  members  with  a  thought  on  something
which one normally does not speak on at this time  of  the  year.  It  is  a
thought on problems, which I think is very apt for us. I  came  across  this
in a book by John Maxwell:


  The decisions we make today concerning problems we have  will  shape  our
  future. Remember, the circumstances in which we find ourselves today  are
  a direct reflection of the decisions  we  made  yesterday.  Problems  are
  reminders. They remind us that we need God's help to handle the upheavals
  of life. Problems are solvable. They always have an answer.  Perhaps  the
  answer is hidden, but there is an answer. The difficulty lies not so much
  in not finding the answer, but in being unwilling to pay  the  price  for
  solving it.

I therefore do not wish hon members a  problem-free  period  until  we  meet
again, because problems there will always be, but I wish that  members  will
be able to find the right answers to all the problems which may  come  their
way. I hope, and I trust, that we collectively, as an institution,  will  in
the new year be able to play our vital role to the  fullest  in  helping  to
solve the problems which our people are still being faced with. I  hope  hon
members also find time to have a very good rest. Best wishes. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Mr Chairperson and hon members, our House is rising  today
as we start our preparations for  the  hectic  festive  season.  I  wish  to
congratulate our Chairperson, Mrs  Pandor,  for  being  such  a  charismatic
leader who is always striving for development. Our Chamber  is  what  it  is
today because of her special talent in leadership.

The NCOP has also been very lucky to have had  Mr  Mushwana  as  its  Deputy
Chairperson. He has since left for the higher position of  Public  Protector
and we wish him well. I also extend a  hearty  welcome  to  our  new  Deputy
Chairperson, Mr Mahlangu, who I know has been elected to  this  position  on
account of a proven record. He will fit well in his predecessor's  shoes.  I
congratulate all our committee chairpersons, all Whips, the secretariat  and
all the members of the support staff for the hard  work  they  undertook  so
well. I also wish to pay tribute to our Chief Whip, the hon Mr Surty. He  is
soft-spoken,  listens  well,  acts   impartially,   and   provides   dynamic
leadership in his capacity as Chief Whip.

Finally, I wish to put  a  feather  in  our  Chairperson's  cap  for  having
arranged a most profitable study tour to  China.  It  was  very  educational
indeed. [Interjections.]

We are sorry to lose hon Moosa. But he will always be in our minds.

I wish all my colleagues a safe journey home and  they  must  have  a  happy
stay with their families. A happy Christmas and a prosperous New  Year.  May
God bless you till we meet again.

Ndlela ntle. [Farewell.]
Mnu H  T  SOGONI:  Mhlali-ngaphambili,  malungu  ahloniphekileyo  ale  Ndlu,
ndivumele nam ndaleke umsundulu kumazwi asele ewisiwe ngoogxa  bam,  sisithi
omnye komnye ``ndlela ntle''.

Uthi umzi  wakwa  UDM  mandidlulise  ilizwe  elicatshulwe  kwivesi  yokuqala
kwiculo lamaWesile elithi `side  sibuye  sihlangane,  wang'uThixo  anganawe,
akuxhase, akukokele. Wang' uThixo anganawe'.

Le  ngoma  sidla  ngokuyicula   xa   sonwabelene,   sincumelana,   sibambene
ngezandla, simbambazelana, sisithi  kulo  simthandayo  ``Ndlela  ntle.  Side
sibuye sihlangane''.  Sitsho  njalo  kuba  intlalo  yethu  apha  ibiyintlalo
yokuthandana, iyintlalo yokumanyana,  iyintlalo  yokusebenzisana,  iyintlalo
yokubonelelana.  Kungoko  ke  sisithi  masihambe,   siye   kubona   izihlobo
nabahlobo, side sibuye sihlangane.

Kodwa, sifuna ukudlulisa  ilizwi  lokubulela  ngokungazenzisiyo  kwiinkokeli
zethu  kule  Ndlu  yeBhunga  leSizwe  lamaPhondo,  sizidibanisa,   sizibopha
ngabhanti  linye  zonke  ngobunkokeli   bazo   obunobuchule,   obunobulumko,
obungqongqo kodwa bunobulungisa, kwa nobungena mkhethe. Sifana  nendlu  enye
phantsi kwesandla senu naphantsi kobunkokeli buka  mam'  uPandor  nakuwe  ke
Sekela Sihlalo, njengentonga yakhe  yasekhosi.  Zimbalwa  intsukwana  sinawe
kodwa sele ubonakalisile into yokuba impawu zobunkokeli  zikho  kuwe,  kwaye
uza kuyifunqula le nqwelo uyibeke emanqwanqweni aphezulu.

Asi  libali  ukudlulisa  ilizwi  kuMbhexeshi  omKhulu  nabanye   ababhexeshi
abasebenzayo ukuqhuba imicimbi yale  Ndlu.  Singalibali  ukubulela  uSihlalo
wekomiti zonke noosihlalo beekomiti, kananjalo, nababhexeshi  abakhoyo.  Asi
libali  ukubulela  kubasebenzi  bayo   le   Ndlu,   singalibali   nokubulela
kubasebenzi okanye koomabhalana boosihlalo  beekomiti  zethu.  Sibe  nexesha
elimnandi sikunye.

Kuthiwa ke mandidlulise  ilizwi  lokugqibela  kumzukulwana  kaMoosa,  ogqibe
ekubeni  axwaye  ibhatyi  yakhe  awenze   ubemfutshane   umthwalo   ulingane
ikhwapha, abambe indlela  ebeze  ngayo.  Kuthiwa  yindlu  yakwaUDM  mandithi
kubaw' uMoosa ebekade engumfana odlamkileyo, egqadaza ukunyathela,  egqadaza
ukuthetha, engesiso isanyamtya. Kuthiwa  masithi  ``ndlela  ntle''.  Nalapho
aya khona aze abe njalo.

Ngaloo mazwi ambalwa  ithi  iUDM:  Side  sibuye  sihlangane.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of Xhosa speech follows.)

[Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, hon members of this House, allow me  to  follow
suit  and  add  on  to  the  words  expressed  by  my  colleagues  and   say
``farewell''.

The UDM says that I should quote from verse one of  the  hymn  book  of  the
Methodists, the words: ``God be with you till we meet again ...''

This hymn we normally sing when  we  are  happy,  smiling  at  one  another,
holding hands, hugging and saying to the one we love:  ``Farewell.  Till  we
meet again.'' We say so because our life here has been  a  life  of  loving,
uniting, co-operating and sharing. It is for that reason that we say:  ``Let
us go and visit relatives and friends, till we meet again.''
However, we want to express a sincere word of thanks to our leaders in  this
the National Council of Provinces, all of  them,  for  their  astute,  wise,
firm but just and  fair  leadership.  We  are  like  one  family  under  the
leadership of Mama Pandor and you, Deputy  Chairperson,  as  her  right-hand
man. You have been with us for a  few  days,  but  already  you  have  shown
leadership qualities, and that you are going to  take  this  institution  to
new heights.

We do not forget to give a word to  the  Chief  Whip  and  other  Whips  who
manage the affairs of this House; not forgetting to  thank  the  Chairperson
of Committees, the chairpersons of the committees as well as all  the  Whips
present here. We cannot forget to thank the staff of this House, as well  as
the staff or secretaries to the chairpersons of our committees. We have  had
a good time together.

I have been instructed to convey a word of thanks to Moosa's  grandson,  who
decided to pack his bags.  The  UDM  says  to  tell  Tata  Moosa  he  is  an
energetic young man, with a spring in his step, and not a  slouch.  The  UDM
instructs me to say: ``Farewell. Good luck for the future.''

With those words the UDM says: Till we meet again. [Applause.]]

Mr  J  O  TLHAGALE:  Mr  Chairperson,  hon  colleagues  and   comrades   ...
[Interjections.]  ...  saying  farewell,  as  usual,  brings   about   mixed
feelings. One is usually looking forward with anxiety to a homeward  journey
and to those that one loves. But at the same time one  is  also  finding  it
difficult to part with those friends  that  one  got  accustomed  to  living
with. We have lived together as members of a broad family, and in  spite  of
our different political affiliations we have learned to  work  together  and
to love each other. We shall undoubtedly miss each  other  during  the  next
two months. But the thought that  it  will  be  for  only  two  months  will
sustain us and keep us going.

We are proud of our leadership in the NCOP,  which,  in  my  assessment,  is
second to none. The Chairperson is a very strict and  capable  lady  with  a
very pleasant and likeable disposition. To the Deputy Chairperson ...

...  mogaetsho,  re  a  go  rata,  o  re  tshware  fela  jalo!  [...  fellow
countrymen, we love you, continue to give us such a warm reception!]

The Chief Whip is a gentle and down-to-earth man of unequalled  benevolence.
As we take leave of one another today I wish to thank the staff of the  NCOP
for their meritorious service and devotion to  work,  and  I  want  to  wish
every one of us a happy Christmas period and a prosperous New Year. May  the
good Lord bless you until we meet again. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I just wish to  remind  you  that
there is a new South African Oxford Dictionary as well. [Interjections.]

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairperson, I have to say that that is a  very  hard  act
to follow.

We miss of course our Chairperson today. We would have liked to  have  taken
leave of her also. We know  that  she  is  very  distinguished  and  she  is
leading a delegation to Japan. We wish those that are away well and  a  safe
return.

You, yourself, Deputy Chairperson, have put your stamp of authority  on  the
Council. You look as if you have always been sitting in that Chair. You  fit
like a glove. That gives us a tremendous feeling of comfort. You really  add
lustre and dignity to this House.

I would simply like to add our thanks,  as  the  ACDP,  to  the  staff,  the
messengers and also the people that we do not see, the Hansard, the  police,
the cleaners, and the catering staff who look after us so well - all of  the
people that make up the infrastructure of this place.

We wish Mr Moosa well. He is a most  energetic  and  able  man.  I  am  sure
wherever he goes he is going to make his mark and we will hear more  of  him
for sure. I would wish members all godspeed. To  all  our  people  that  are
going home: a safe return to their  families  and  a  safe  return  to  this
Place. For those of them that are celebrating Ramadan: a happy  Ramadan  and
a happy Eid. For the Christians, a very happy and blessed Christmas  period.
I thank you and godspeed to you all. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  members,
in summary, on behalf of the presiding officers,  I  wish  to  join  you  in
saying go home, go and work, but create some space to  rest  as  well.  Your
families need you. I am aware that you have been here the  whole  year.  You
have not had time to actually be with your  families.  They  need  you  too.
Please do create one or two days to be fully with them. They need  you  down
at home. We  as  presiding  officers  wish  you  a  merry  Christmas  and  a
prosperous New Year.

I just want to remind you of one thing. I am sure  it  is  about  five  days
since I have joined the National Council of Provinces. I am avoiding  saying
``NCOP''. I have enjoyed the spirit in which  debate  takes  place  in  this
little House. I found myself in a family of people  who  differ  with  ideas
but laugh thereafter again. The spirit is so cordial. One  enjoys  to  chair
from  the  seat  where  I  am.  It  is  unlike  in  the  National  Assembly.
[Interjections.]

There is one thing I would like to say. This  might  interest  you.  I  have
been married for almost 30 years. I do not know who in this House  has  been
married for almost 30 years like me. Oh,  there  are  many.  A  writer  once
said: ``During the first year of marriage, the husband speaks and  the  wife
listens. During the second  year  of  marriage,  the  wife  speaks  and  the
husband listens. During the third year of  marriage,  both  speak,  and  the
neighbours listen.'' What I am trying to say  is  that  the  friendliness  I
have seen here and the good debates I have listened to  since  I  have  been
here, should not divide us.

As we go home and meet our families out there, let  us  be  seen  as  public
representatives who are keen to represent our South  African  citizens,  and
who are elected to come  and  conduct  our  duties  here  with  dignity  and
represent those people that have shown confidence  in  us.  Let  us  not  be
divided there, but rather show people that we can speak and  be  divided  on
issues, but there are nationally important issues where  we  have  to  agree
and move this country forward. I wish to thank you all.

The Council adjourned at 17:30.
