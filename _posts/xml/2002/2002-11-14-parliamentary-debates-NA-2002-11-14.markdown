Mr D A A OLIFANT: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that South Africa has been voted one of the top  world  tourist
       destinations by the prestigious Conde Nast Traveller magazine and the
       UK BBC travel programme, Holidays ;

       people and its natural heritage, and confirms the correctness of  our
       Government's policies  in  preserving  the  natural  environment  and
       working for sustainable development;


  (4) further believes that this  will  attract  foreign  tourists  to  the
       country and will result in more jobs being created; and

       destinations in the world. [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, I shall move:


  That the House -

  (2) expresses its deepest and sincerest condolences to the  families  and

Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek namens  die  Nuwe  NP
gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -
  (1) sy dank teenoor President Mbeki uitspreek vir  die  dringende  aandag

       wanorde wat grondbelastings in die landbou veroorsaak;

  (4) die Kabinet versoek om te verseker dat die reëls  van  die  nuwe  Wet
       landwyd en eenvormig toepasbaar sal wees; en


  (5)  kennis  neem  van  die  standpunt   van   die   Katz-kommissie   wat
       grondbelasting as 'n duur belasting beskou en aanbeveel  dat  dit  in

       te wees nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, I move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1)  conveys  its  gratitude  towards  President  Mbeki  for  the  urgent
       attention he is giving to the New NP's representations to investigate
       the disorder caused by property taxes in agriculture;


  (2) conveys its gratitude to the Premier of the Western Cape for bringing
       this matter to the attention of the President;


  (3) notes that the New NP is going to once again make representations for
       a moratorium on the introduction of property tax  until  the  law  on
       assessment rates has been conducted by Parliament;


  (4) requests that the Cabinet ensures that the rules of the new  law  are
       applied uniformly throughout the country;


  (5) notes the Katz Commission's view of property tax as an expensive  tax
       and recommends that it should, in any event, be no more  than  1%  of
       the agricultural value of the land.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Chairperson, I will move on behalf of the  UDM  at  the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) recognises that many of the procedures and  practices  of  the  South
       African Parliament as an institution are modelled on those that  were
       in vogue decades ago in the Westminster system;


  (2) accepts that, with the passage of time and largely because  of  rapid
       advances that have been made in the technological age, many of  these
       customs and conventions have become outmoded and often border on  the
       ridiculous because they are followed in letter but not in spirit;


  (3) realises the need for a total re-evaluation to be executed of all the
       functional elements that collectively constitute Parliament  and  for
       methods to be  introduced  that  will  modernise  its  operation  and
       enhance its efficiency and encourage true and coherent debate; and


 (4)  calls upon the powers-that-be to appoint a  task  team  to  undertake
       this evaluation and to consider proposals ...
[Time expired.]

Mr M S MANIE: Chairperson, I move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that, as from 1 April 2003, domestic and  agricultural  workers
       will be covered by the Unemployment Insurance Fund;


  (2) believes that this is a demonstration of the commitment  of  the  ANC
       Government to the protection of the most vulnerable  workers  in  our
       country, that is, the domestic workers and farmworkers;


  (3) further believes that this  is  a  reflection  of  this  Government's
       unwavering resolve towards establishing a  national  social  security
       system designed to meet the needs  of  workers  in  both  formal  and
       informal sectors; and


  (4) welcomes the announcement by the Government  to  cover  domestic  and
       farmworkers within the ambit  of  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Fund.
       [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the SA Police Service for  the  arrest  of  twelve  men
       implicated in a cash-in-transit heist at Saaiplaas in Limpopo in  the
       afternoon of the same day of the robbery;


  (2) also congratulates the member of the public who tipped off the police
       about the robbery;


  (3) notes that three people were killed during the robbery,  including  a
       teenage boy who was riding a bicycle;


  (4) notes also that six bags  of  money  and  six  stolen  vehicles  were
       recovered; and


  (5) encourages members of the public to continue to assist the police  to
       deal with these kinds of crime.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay  the  extent  to  which  some  formerly  white  and
       privileged schools continue to spurn all efforts relating to goodwill
       and reconciliation;


  (2) also notes that -


       (a)  the ink had hardly dried on Judge Eberhardt Bertelsman's writing
           pad to the effect that Laerskool Middleburg in Mpumalanga should
           use English as another medium of instruction;


       (b)  similar contempt against the Education  Ministry's  ambition  to
           promote multilingualism was displayed by the Danie Malan Primary
           School in Pretoria  North  when  they  ran  a  parent's  meeting
           programme in Afrikaans only and went on  to  announce  that  the
           school will admit only Afrikaans-speaking  learners  next  year;
           and


       (c)  this is a clear effort to exclude other racial groups from  this
           public school; and


  (3) calls on the Ministry  of  Education  to  word  the  language  policy
       framework so clearly that it is unambiguous in so far as the  use  of
       all languages is concerned.

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that South Africa will be part of a worldwide  campaign  of  16
       days of activism for no violence against women and children;


  (2) further notes that this campaign -


       (a)  aims to raise  awareness  and  mobilise  society  to  fight  the
           scourge of women and child abuse; and


       (b)  will be driven under the theme ``South Africa united in fighting
           violence against women and children";


  (3) believes that -


       (a)  women and child abuse practices are a violation of human rights;
           and


       (b)  all  our  people  need  to  be  consistently  conscientised  and
           mobilised to fight against this barbaric and inhuman  behaviour;
           and


  (4) calls on all South Africans to  join  the  campaign  of  16  days  of
       activism for no violence against women and children.

[Applause.]

(Translation of Setswana notice of motion follows)

[Mrs B N SONO:  Chairperson, I hereby give notice, that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  about 45% of South Africans live on R20 per day;


       (b)  on average children are not well fed; and


       (c)  it is therefore surprising to hear President Thabo Mbeki  saying
           that hunger is on the decrease.


  (2) accepts the DP's suggestion that -


       (a)  the poor be given R110 per  month  to  decrease  the  levels  of
           poverty by 74%;


       (b)  such a step would help thousands of our people; and


       (c)  the ANC Government consider the DP's proposal that the  poor  be
           given a basic income grant.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a gang of con artists, posing as employees  of  a  finance
       house and using forged documentation to get the  dealers  to  release
       their vehicles to them, have defrauded a Newcastle car dealership  of
       seven trucks valued at nearly R6 million;
  (2) further notes that this gang also tried to defraud dealers  in  other
       parts of the country;


  (3) urges all motor vehicle dealerships to take care and to  ensure  that
       the correct documentation and proper  procedures  are  followed  when
       releasing vehicles, so as to protect themselves from these criminals;
       and


  (4) hopes that these con artists will be arrested shortly.

Mrs C I LUDWABE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the African National Congress will hold its 51st  National
       Conference from 16 - 20 December 2002 in Stellenbosch;


  (2) further notes that the ANC will review progress  made  and  obstacles
       encountered in the historic road towards the attainment of the  noble
       objectives of a nonracial, nonsexist, democratic and prosperous South
       Africa;


  (3) believes that the ANC continues to pledge in solemnity its commitment
       to serving the people of South Africa;


  (4) further believes that the ANC will at this coming 51st Congress -


       (a)  adopt policies that will improve the lives of  all  our  people;
           and


       (b)  rededicate itself to fighting and never giving up until all  our
           people live in a country that is free ...

[Time expired.]

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move  on  behold
of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the response of Gauteng  Premier  Shilowa  with  regard  to  DA
       legislator  Shelley  Loe's  statements  on  the  Soweto  bombings  by
       accusing her of having a callous disregard for the bomb  attacks  and
       their impact on black people;


  (2) further notes that Shelley Loe had suggested that the  police  should
       not prioritise their investigation into  the  bomb  attacks,  because
       criminals are causing more murder and mayhem than pockets of  loonies
       could hope to do;


  (3) expresses its shock in the covert manner in which  the  DA  wants  to
       downplay the seriousness of the bombings; and


  (4) demands that the hon Leon and the DA come clean, suspend Shelley  Loe
       and take disciplinary action against her.

[Applause.]

Mr D G MKONO: Chairperson, I move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) on the eve of the holiday season,  expresses  its  concern  that  the
       authorities' predominant emphasis on combating speeding has led to  a
       neglect of other factors that lead to road accidents;


  (2) notes that the Minister of Transport has recently admitted that -


       (a)  in a period  of  12  months  ending  March  this  year,  27  654
           pedestrians were involved in road accidents, leading  to  2  124
           fatalities and a further 8 417 seriously injured; and


       (b)  last year 23 775 accidents were  caused  by  vehicles  colliding
           with stationary vehicles;


  (3) recognises that these figures point to the need for more  active  and
       targeted policing; and


  (4) urges all South Africans to drive safely and responsibly during  this
       holiday season.

       PROGRESS IN TRANSFORMATION AND RESTRUCTURING OF PUBLIC SERVICE

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Chairperson,  and
members of this House, as this  parliamentary  year  draws  to  a  close,  I
deemed it important to make a brief statement on the progress  that  we  are
making in the  transformation  and  restructuring  of  the  Public  Service,
particularly looking at the restructuring of  our  departments  at  national
and provincial level. Today is an opportunity for all members of  Parliament
to reflect on the progress and also on the challenges in this process.

As members will recall, on 13 June 2002, we obtained  a  majority  agreement
with our labour partners on a framework that would guide the  transformation
and restructuring  of  the  Public  Service.  This  agreement  was  a  major
achievement in our endeavours to put the spirit of Batho Pele  people  first
into action.

The signing of the agreement signalled a joint resolve by both employer  and
employee parties to give effect to our Constitution, which  requires  of  us
to deliver services in a people-oriented way and to maximise  the  resources
that are at the disposal of the state. It is important to  remind  ourselves
of the purpose of this entire restructuring process, so that we do not  look
at it outside of its proper context.

The restructuring exercise is part of our broader efforts  of  building  the
capacity of the state to play a developmental role to ensure that  we  build
a state focused on nation-building in economic, social and political terms.

We as a democratic Government have made  it  clear,  since  1994,  that  the
Public Service inherited by this Government was,  both  in  orientation  and
organisation,  not  geared  towards  playing  this  role.  Instead,  it  was
structured to entrench racial and ethnic  divides  and  to  further  sustain
apartheid inequities. In addition, as  the  Presidential  Review  Commission
points out, it was a public service that was  created  and  managed  largely
for, and I quote:


  ... purposes of regulation, control and constraint, and not for those  of
  community empowerment and development.

It had a lot of serious deficiencies, but these were  hidden  because  there
was no commitment to equity, efficiency, effectiveness,  accountability  and
transparency.

This was the Public Service we inherited, and we were mandated  to  build  a
single effective team out of this, a team of public servants that would  put
people first. It is against this background  that  soon  after  coming  into
office,  this  Government  prioritised  the  transformation  of  the  Public
Service, starting  with  the  amalgamation  and  rationalisation  of  former
public service establishments into one entity.

I think we should remind ourselves that the Constitution did not mandate  us
only to create a single Public Service but also mandated us  to  create  one
that has a developmental orientation.

Much of the research done on developmental states underscore the  importance
of building sound capabilities, because we must ensure that a  developmental
state does not  remain  a  political  dream.  Experience  shows  that  these
capabilities do not come as gifts inherited from the past but, instead,  are
consciously created and developed. As  Thandika  Mkandawire  of  the  United
Nations Research for  Social  Development  reminds  us  in  addressing  this
situation, and I quote:


  ... the way forward does not lie in the  wholesale  neglect  of  existing
  capacities in the quest for new ones, but in the  utilisation,  retooling
  and reinvigorating of existing capacities.

This is exactly what our current restructuring  of  the  Public  Service  is
about. It is not  about  the  wholesale  neglect  of  what  exists  or  mass
retrenchments. Instead,  it  is  about  ensuring  that  there  is  a  better
utilisation of our human resources  in  order  for  it  to  deliver  on  the
priorities of Government and that we have the right skilled  people  in  the
right places in the Public Service. We have existing  capacities  that  need
to be better  utilised  and  reinvigorated,  and  that  is  the  process  we
embarked on.

The agreement signed with organised labour  recognises  the  need  for  each
department to have a clear focus on the strategic objectives that  it  wants
to achieve, and to have the structures,  processes,  systems  and  resources
that are required to turn their aims and objectives  into  reality.  We  all
know that most departments have excellent plans, but the difficulties  often
arise during the implementation process.

Some of the challenges that we have  identified  in  our  surveys  are  that
certain departments have disproportional  institutional  capacity  in  urban
areas, but lack capacity in rural areas. Others tend  to  perform  functions
that are not  core  to  their  mandates,  or  have  inappropriately  skilled
officials, or have them deployed in the wrong places or positions.

To deal with these diverse challenges, the  framework  agreement,  first  of
all, confirms that departments should have strategic plans  in  place;  that
these plans should inform their organisational structures,  and  that  posts
should be defined through proper job  descriptions  and  that  these  should
determine the competencies of required employees. After  a  process  of  job
matching has taken place, departments  are  required  to  deal  with  skills
mismatches, through strategies such as retraining and redeployment.

Mechanisms and structures have been put in place to  give  effect  to  these
principles. Departmental and interdepartmental task teams are key  to  these
processes,  and  they  consist  of  representatives  from  both  labour  and
management to ensure that due process is followed.

However, there are certain problems and I am going to reflect on that  quite
candidly this afternoon. The reports that we are  getting  from  departments
show that there are serious challenges  around  the  implementation  of  the
agreement.

The strategic plans  of  some  departments  are  simply  too  weak  to  draw
conclusions  on  their  human  resource  requirements.   In   other   cases,
departments have not been able to conduct a proper assessment of  the  human
resources that they have at their  disposal  or  decide  on  the  nature  of
changes that are required.

Some managers in the Public Service are  clearly  not  equipped  to  conduct
reviews of the way in which they  deliver  services  and  how  this  can  be
improved.

Now, we as the executive will have to monitor closely the  different  levels
of government to see if, indeed, there are managers who  are  not  competent
to fulfil their responsibility in terms of  the  Public  Finance  Management
Act and the Public Service Act. If this exercise exposes  weakness  in  this
area, we will take corrective measures, which  in  itself  will  be  to  the
benefit of a more effective Public Service.

When it comes to the human resource implications of  organisational  change,
there is a particular reluctance to address  problem  areas.  Some  managers
tend to think that it is somebody else's responsibility  to  review  whether
they have the right employees with the  right  skills  to  deliver  services
effectively.

I want to state upfront that we had intended  to  be  further  than  we  are
right now.  Although  most  departments  have  established  their  oversight
structures, they should by now have completed the matching and placement  of
excess personnel. This is still in progress.

Another  source  of  concern  is  that  certain  managers  do  not  seem  to
appreciate the necessity of minimising job losses during  the  restructuring
process. I have issued  a  directive  clearly  stating  that  nonspecialised
positions may not be advertised in the open labour market while there  might
be excess employees who could be absorbed into these positions.

Yet we continue to see adverts for secretaries and other  support  personnel
in newspapers.  Intransigent  managers  must  not  be  surprised  if  unions
challenge them when they violate  the  agreement,  neither  should  they  be
startled when their Ministers challenge them for violating  this  agreement,
because members of the executive are overseeing this  restructuring  process
very closely.

I also want to state that, in the executive, we see this as  an  opportunity
to identify those public servants who have gone  by  as  the  unsung  public
servants who are doing more work, but have not been acknowledged.  We  would
like to see a  process  in  which  they  are  acknowledged  and  brought  to
positions in which they should serve in the Public Service. [Applause.]

Therefore, restructuring is about ensuring that  we  acknowledge  those  who
have been unacknowledged, that we have a correct structure in place for  the
Public Service, and that we build  the  developmental  state  that  we  have
shown a commitment to, and that we make this a reality.

Despite the challenges that I  have  mentioned,  at  least  we  now  have  a
framework in place that allows departments  to  fundamentally  review  their
organisational architecture and staffing requirements. Towards  the  end  of
this financial year, we should be in a position to indicate how many  excess
public servants were successfully redeployed and retrained.

In general, public servants can rest assured that there are many  employment
opportunities. They should also note that  we  do  want  to  prioritise  our
rural areas by taking  people  out  there  in  order  to  make  our  service
extensions actually function and service delivery effective in those  areas.
They should also note  that  we  are  doing  our  very  best  to  give  them
preference in filling these positions.

However, from their side, public servants need to be prepared to  also  make
sacrifices. Generous relocation privileges that will ease  the  process  are
in place. I think it should further be noted by public  servants  that  they
should be conscious of  the  provision  in  the  agreement  that  reasonable
redeployment  offers  may  not  be  refused.  Our  labour  partners  are  in
agreement that public servants who decline such offers  will  be  deemed  to
have resigned from the Public Service.

Perhaps it is important that, as I  conclude,  we  should  remind  ourselves
that the 1994 White Paper on Reconstruction and Development proclaimed,  and
I quote:


  South Africa has begun, for the first time in its history,  to  undertake
  the task of equitable  development  of  life  opportunities  of  all  its
  citizens. It has a unique opportunity at this time to transform the means
  and the methods through which its social goals are to be achieved.
If  we  are  a  truly  developmental  state,  a  state  that  leads  in  the
transformation of our nation, we must ensure that we have the  right  skills
in the right places. We need to know where and what  our  shortcomings  are,
and this should not be based on anecdotal evidence. The Public  Service  has
an opportunity to transform the means and  methods  through  which  services
are delivered. We need to seize this opportunity, and politically, we  would
say we should seize the moment.

I would like to  urge  all  role-players  and  stakeholders  in  the  Public
Service to give their full co-operation in ensuring a smooth  implementation
process, because failure to do so may  stall  the  process  and  this  could
result in our not being able to achieve our goals.

Government views the Public Service as a national asset, and we  see  public
servants as the key instrument in building a better life for all. Let us  be
united in our vision of building a strong developmental state in  which  the
interests of those being served truly come first. We  should  take  on  this
challenge as we have taken on challenges in the past, the big challenge,  as
I have said, being that of building the developmental state.
In thanking this House for this  opportunity,  I  would  like  to  wish  all
members of Parliament and of the Public Service well. During this period  of
Ramadaan and fasting, I wish to say to those concerned that we  all  support
them. I also  wish  all  those  who  are  still  going  to  celebrate  other
religious festivities well too. [Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members,  the  restructuring  of
the Public Service will allow Government a golden opportunity  to  modernise
the Public Service into an efficient service delivery machine.

The Democratic Alliance has stated several times  in  this  House  that  the
introduction  of  sector  pay  increases,  the  scrapping  of  the   central
bargaining chamber  and  the  implementation  of  performance  increases  to
reward hard-working public servants would contribute to a more  professional
and modern Public Service. However, one principle  the  Minister  failed  to
mention in her speech was that of ethics within the Public  Service  or,  in
some cases, the lack of it.

The  non-compliance  with  regulations  is  rife  and   the   Minister   has
highlighted an example where  advertising  for  posts  is  still  continuing
despite a moratorium. Another case in point is  that  of  the  recording  of
sick leave. A report recently released by the Public Service Commission  not
only highlighted the lack of sick leave being captured but also the cost  of
sick leave to the taxpayer. The cost  for  sick  leave  for  the  period  of
October 1999 to September 2000 was R631 million.

However, the accuracy of data captured by  provinces  such  as  the  Eastern
Cape,  Mpumalanga  and  Limpopo  were  unreliable  when  compared  to  other
provinces. According to the data,  only  2,7%  of  public  servants  in  the
Eastern Cape took sick leave, while the figures  in  other  provinces  range
between 27% and 90%.  The  report  goes  further  by  stating  that,  and  I
quote:``According to the estimate of Persal, the state's liability in  terms
of unrecorded leave amounts to R20 billion''.  The  figure  was  arrived  at
through an investigation conducted by Persal during  which  departments  had
to confirm  the  amount  of  leave  not  captured.  It  is  twenty  billion,
Chairperson, not twenty million.

What an appalling waste of money money  that  could  have  helped  those  in
need, particularly those who are actually dying of starvation, by  paying  a
basic income grant whereby all South  Africans  earning  below  R7  500  per
annum would receive R110 per month under a Democratic  Alliance  government.
[Interjections.] While the DA recognises that a new leave  dispensation  was
introduced to the Public Service in July 2000, we are  concerned  that  this
is  not  being  implemented  properly  due  to  the  lack  of  training,  in
particular, of line managers.

Therefore, the DA suggests the following: Any public servant who takes  sick
leave must produce a doctor's certificate in certain circumstances, such  as
when sick leave is taken on a  Friday  or  a  Monday;  the  introduction  of
penalties for public servants  found  to  be  abusing  sick  leave;  regular
audits of sick leave patterns; that the public sector agrees  and  adopts  a
standard measurement of sickness absence in  order  to  collect  information
that is reliable and fits the  recording  definitions  required;  that  line
managers establish an agreed time on the  first  day  of  illness  by  which
employees should make contact with them, and that line managers  be  trained
on how to  handle  sick  leave,  including  the  capturing  of  information,
maintaining frequent contact and back-to-work interviews. It would  be  well
worth the investment of a couple of million  rand  to  train  line  managers
properly than to pour another twenty billion down the drain.

Another point  of  concern  for  the  DA  is  that  of  the  Public  Service
Commission. While it receives a budget of R54 million, it  lacks  the  teeth
needed to enforce the reams of regulations  the  hon  Minister's  department
produces. A case in point is that of the asset register of  senior  managers
and the verification of  qualifications.  The  DA  would  like  to  see  the
following happen with the Public Service Commission: That the Commission  be
funded independently through the Speaker of the House  and  not  the  Public
Service Administration  Ministry.  This  would  allow  the  Commission  more
independence. The powers of the Commission should be reviewed  in  order  to
justify its budget of R54 million, and the salaries of the 14  commissioners
and the nine provincial officers should also be reviewed.

The DA appreciates that the restructuring of the Public Service  is  not  an
easy task and one sincerely hopes that the Government's plans  to  modernise
its  administration  will  stand  the  test  of  time.  I  would   like   to
congratulate the Minister and her department on being the  first  department
to produce  an  annual  report  in  CD  format,  thus  saving  the  taxpayer
thousands of rands. [Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Chairperson and  hon  members,  the  Department  of  Public
Service and Administration is on track in terms of its aims  and  objectives
in areas of transformation and  corporate  management.  Although  employment
equity targets could not be met as set out, the progress made is  impressive
and is a signpost of success. That the department's performance record  went
beyond policy imperatives in the year under review  is  a  matter  to  write
home about and, at the same time,  it  poses  a  challenge  to  other  state
departments.

The improvements in service delivery  has  been  achieved  as  a  result  of
partnerships and healthy interaction with stakeholders  relevant  to  public
service  and  administration  in  national   and   provincial   spheres   of
Government.

``Batho Pele'' continues to be a call in the department,  and  it  is  hoped
that internal consulting services in the establishment will go  a  long  way
towards alleviating conditions responsible for underspending in some of  the
departments.
The introduction of laptops will enhance  performance  to  a  great  measure
because officers will no longer be confined to their  office  computers  but
will be able to work in  any  convenient  environment  with  their  portable
laptops.

The Minister has elaborated on the restructuring  plan  in  the  department,
and it is hoped that the implementation aspect of the plan will not  inhibit
performance and efficiency in other departments. It is commendable that  the
Eastern  Cape  and  the  Limpopo  Provinces  are  high  on  the  agenda  for
restructuring in some of their operations.

Indeed, the IFP supports the Minister's restructuring  plan  with  the  hope
that the unions with which the Minister has negotiated and agreed  upon  the
plan will not cause hiccups during the implementation phase. Yes,  the  plan
encapsulates retraining and redeployment of staff to  new  departments,  new
environments, new work ethics and new opportunities. It  is  envisaged  that
such redeployment will enhance employment opportunities in rural  areas  and
we ask that the Minister live up to this promise.

The Minister is  quite  correct  in  saying  that  ``right  skills  must  be
employed  in  their  right  places''.  When  this  is  done  correctly,  the
escalating scourge of the braindrain from South  Africa  to  Europe  may  be
curbed and the civil  service  will  be  stable  once  more.  God  help  the
Department.

Mnr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Geagte Voorsitter, in die  Suid-Afrika  van  vandag
is daar twee groepe mense: dié wat opreg ten gunste  is  van  transformasie,
en dié wat teen transformasie is. Daar is dié van ons,  soos  die  Nuwe  NP,
wat sê indien jy Suid-Afrika wil maak werk, moet jy jou deel bydra  tot  die
proses van herstrukturering, moet jy versiende genoeg wees om te  besef  dat
jy nie, soos die DP en die VF, krampagtig kan vasklou aan dit  wat  jy  dink
net aan jou behoort nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Jy het die keuse om, soos die DP en die VF,  in  jou  hoogheilige  laer  van
selfvoldaanheid en selfsugtigheid te bly  sit,  en  uiteindelik  verteer  te
word in jou eie grootheidswaan, waarin jy die regte van ander  mense  misken
en sodoende die regte van jou eie mense vernietig. Jy het die keuse om  soos
die DP, met fotosessies en goedkoop ``spin doctoring'', die illusie te  skep
dat jy omgee terwyl jy weet dat jou gemaakte besorgdheid  net  daarop  gemik
is om jou eie saak te bevorder.

Jy kan, soos  die  VF,  die  groep  van  63  se  dade  van  terreur  probeer
regverdig, en in die proses vir jou die verwaande  reg  aanmatig  om  namens
alle Afrikaners te praat. [Tussenwerpsels.] Aan die VF en die groep  van  63
sê die Nuwe NP vanmiddag: ons sal nie toelaat dat  julle  hierdie  drogbeeld
van Afrikaners as mense wat nie tuis voel in Suid-Afrika die wêreld  instuur
nie. As julle nie deel wil wees hiervan nie, is dit julle saak.

Aan die ander kant vind jy die Nuwe NP wat  sê,  kom  ons  maak  Suid-Afrika
werk deur konstruktiewe betrokkenheid, sodat die Staatsdiens en die land  so
herstruktureer kan word dat alle  Suid-Afrikaners,  swart,  wit,  bruin,  en
Indiër,  hierby  baat  sal  vind.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Hon Chairperson,  in  the  South  Africa  of  today
there  are  two  groups  of  people:  those  who  are  truly  in  favour  of
transformation and those who are against transformation.  There  are  those,
like the New NP, who say that if one wants to make South  Africa  work,  one
must make a contribution to the process of restructuring, one must  be  far-
sighted enough to realise that one cannot, like the DP and  FF,  desperately
cling to that which one thinks belongs just to one.

One has the choice to, like the DP and the FF, stay put in one's  sacrosanct
laager of self-righteousness and selfishness,  finally  to  be  consumed  by
one's own delusions of grandeur, in  which  one  disregards  the  rights  of
other people and in so doing destroys the rights of one's  own  people.  One
has the choice to create, like the DP, with photo sessions and cheap  ``spin
doctoring'', the illusion  that  one  cares,  while  one  knows  that  one's
feigned concern is only aimed at advancing one's own cause.

One can, like the FF, try to justify the group of 63's deeds of terror,  and
in the process usurp for oneself the presumptuous right to speak  on  behalf
of all Afrikaners. [Interjections.] To the FF and the group of 63,  the  New
NP says this afternoon that we will not allow  them  to  send  this  twisted
image of Afrikaners as people who do not feel at home in South  Africa  into
the world. If they do not want to be part of this, it is their business.

On the other side one finds the New  NP,  which  says:  Let  us  make  South
Africa work through constructive engagement, so that the Public Service  and
the country can be restructured in a way that  all  South  Africans:  black,
white, brown and Indian can derive benefit from this.]

The need for co-operation in the process of restructuring South Africa as  a
whole was emphasised  by  the  Premier  of  the  Eastern  Cape  at  the  ANC
Provincial Conference in Port Elizabeth this  weekend,  and  I  quote:  ``To
work with the New NP is the right thing thing to do and we believe in  it''.
It is important to recognise that while the ANC  and  the  New  NP  recently
emerged from a situation of conflict, this struggle was  never  against  the
people of the National Party. It was a struggle against  the  philosophy  of
governing the country to the exclusion of the majority of its citizens.  The
battle is now over, and we have no choice but to stand  together  and  build
our country and our province into a nonracial community. [Applause.]

Today, the Minister gave Parliament an honest insight  into  the  challenges
that lie ahead during this  restructuring  process.  I  want  to  thank  the
Minister for her honesty and frankness in dealing with this matter. The  New
NP is committed to the process.  We  believe  that  politicians  and  public
servants should stand together and  share  the  same  vision  in  delivering
services to South Africans and improving the quality of  life  of  everybody
in this country. [Applause.]

Mr  T  ABRAHAMS:  Mr  Chairperson,  since  its  inception,   the   UDM   has
consistently drawn attention to  poor  service  delivery  in  a  variety  of
departments.  It  has  focused  attention  on  deficiencies  that  arose  in
particular  departments  due  to   a   lack   of   commitment,   efficiency,
accountability and drive among public servants.

Despite the availability of the  services  provided  by  the  SA  Management
Development Institute, the failure to put the people first, as displayed  by
many a public servant, has often been  traced  to  managerial  incompetence.
Government itself has, in the past,  recognised  this  weakness  and  it  is
refreshing to note that the hon the Minister makes specific reference to  it
in her statement. The UDM welcomes the intention to monitor the  functioning
of managers in the various departments closely  and,  more  importantly,  to
take corrective  steps  where  managers  are  found  to  be  incompetent  in
fulfilling their responsibilities in terms of the Public  Services  Act  and
the PFMA.

In equal measure, the acknowledgement of  those  who  excel  is  seen  as  a
positive step by the UDM. The move towards a more equitable distribution  of
public servants between urban and rural areas is also supported by the  UDM.
It needs to be pointed out, though, that there is a need  to  guard  against
the danger of uncommitted and incompetent public servants being  imposed  on
the rural areas merely to cut excesses  where  they  occur.  While  the  UDM
welcomes the progressive move towards qualitative improvement of the  Public
Service, it cautions  against  the  danger  of  conflating  downsizing  with
transformation.  A  reduction  in  numbers  does   not   necessarily   equal
improvement of service.

The UDM expresses the  hope  that  the  framework  arrived  at  between  the
department and labour will be respected by both institutions  and  that  the
Minister will ensure that it will be upheld throughout  its  implementation.
It is vital that the types of disputes that  arose  between  Government  and
labour in the restructuring of state assets are avoided.

Finally, I wish all public servants  well  over  the  coming  holidays  and,
similarly, to our colleagues in this House.

Adv Z L MADASA: Mr Chairperson, the hon  the  Minister  has  said  that  the
purpose of the restructuring is to build the capacity of the  state  and  to
deliver services and enhance the developmental nature of the state. I  would
like to say that Batho Pele is not only about the clients of the  state  but
about the workers as well.

I would like to pose the question to the Minister  whether  the  climate  is
suitable for restructuring, because the net result will be some job  losses.
I suggest that we place a moratorium not on the restructuring itself but  on
the implementation of it because of poverty and the levels of  unemployment.
However, in view of the fact that the hon the Minister  has  struck  a  deal
with the unions, who are the better spokesmen for the workers,  I  therefore
do not want to spoil the party. We will  support  the  Minister  with  those
reservations.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, while there is substance  in  the  new  Public
Service having found employees who did  not  match  their  postings,  it  is
equally true that a good number of public servants who were appointed  post-
1994 are equally without  the  necessary  skills.  Some  were  appointed  as
reward for their role in the struggle and not in the service. Most of  those
who have been discovered to have forged their qualifications are  those  who
were appointed post-1994.

There is, however, welcome merit in having to define  posts  through  proper
job descriptions. There is also merit in mounting efforts to  retrain  those
who will be found wanting in their jobs.

We  appreciate  the  fact  that  the  Department  of  Public   Service   and
Administration has come to realise that some managers in  their  employ  are
placeholders and  will  be  dealt  with  in  terms  of  the  Public  Finance
Management Act. We hope this will be done without any  fear  or  favour,  as
this is the spirit of the Act.

Finally, we appreciate that the department has done a thorough  analysis  of
the Public Service and pledge to support all efforts that are calculated  to
deliver a clean, mean and lean Public Service.

Miss  S  RAJBALLY:  Chairperson,  Public  Service  delivery  has   increased
tremendously since the placement of democratic government. The challenge  to
alleviate poverty and put in  place  a  public  service  for  better  living
conditions for the majority has been cumbersome. The Government's method  of
not taking excessive loans to impress on service  delivery  is  the  correct
approach. The  servicing  of  the  massive  debt  hinders  the  Government's
genuine attempt to ensure job creation through service delivery.

However, the general public at large has to be  aware  of  the  difficulties
faced by the Government so as to ensure  that  the  negative  attitudes  and
vibes about Government's failure thus far to deliver can  to  be  addressed.
Much more exposure is  needed  on  the  positive  things  happening  in  the
country, and particularly within this department, as  well  as  the  reasons
for the negative aspects.

The Minority Front applauds the department and the  Minister  for  promising
service delivery and we wish them well in the restructuring  of  the  Public
Service.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, ons dank die agb  Minister  dat  ons  haar
verklaring voortydig gekry het sodat ons daarop  kan  antwoord  en  nie  net
politiek maak nie.

Die AEB waardeer die agb Minister se fokus op dienslewering en nie 'n  lompe
burokrasie nie. Dit lyk ook of  daar  'n  mate  van  realisme  en  soberheid
ingetree het in terme van herstrukturering, soos blyk uit die  agb  Minister
se standpunt dat bestaande mannekrag nie afgelê nie,  maar  beter  aangewend
gaan word. Ons waardeer dit.

Die AEB stem ook saam dat mooi plannetjies nie genoeg is  nie,  maar  eerder
praktiese  dienslewering,  want  ``the  proof  of  the  pudding  is  in  the
eating''. Dit is juis die klag wat ons daagliks kry, oor  die  onbekwaamheid
en ondoeltreffendheid daar waar ons in die  tou  voor  die  toonbank  staan.
Daar is een groot slang in die gras. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr Chairman, we thank the hon Minister that we got her statement  timeously
so that we can respond to it and not merely make politics.

The AEB appreciates the hon Minister's focus on service delivery and  not  a
mere clumsy bureaucracy. It also looks  as  if  there  is  some  measure  of
realism and austerity in terms of restructuring,  as  is  evident  from  the
Minister's statement that existing manpower  will  not  be  retrenched,  but
utilised elsewhere. We appreciate that.

The AEB also agrees that nice  little  plans  are  not  enough,  but  rather
practical service delivery, since  the  proof  of  the  pudding  is  in  the
eating. That is the complaint that we get on a  daily  basis,  namely  about
the lack of skills and the inefficiency where we have to  queue  before  the
counter. There is a big snake in the grass.]

The hon the Minister has said that public servants  who  decline  reasonable
redeployment offers will be deemed to have resigned. Reasonable  is  a  very
subjective concept. She  must  please  answer  this  question.  If  a  civil
servant in Pretoria with school-going children and a  wife  or  husband  who
works at a local company  declines  a  transfer  to  Pafuri,  will  that  be
regarded as a reasonable offer rejected? Will the courts eventually have  to
decide on this? Will the hon the Minister please answer this question?

We thank the hon the Minister and we support her declaration.

An HON MEMBER: Where is Pafuri?

Mr C AUCAMP: Pafuri? Come with  me  and  I  will  show  you.  It  is  in  my
province. [Interjections.]
Mr P J GOMOMO: Chairperson, it has always been a  reality  that  the  Public
Service's transformation agenda would have to be  characterised  by  several
sets of options, one of which is  restructuring.  I  choose  to  state  that
restructuring means structuring anew, which means tampering with  any  given
problematic order of things, guided to turn around a  problematic  situation
until it takes on the configuration of a solution.

In this context, the question that we should not shy away from  as  we  deal
with the restructuring topic is: How much of a problem is the current  state
of the Public Service? It is problematic in the sense that it is founded  on
an incorrect basis, namely, that of  a  disintegrating  culture  of  service
delivery, born out of an arrangement to service this country as a pocket  of
geographic divisions  based  on  race  and  ethnicity,  and  anchored  by  a
recruitment strategy based  on  compliance  and  patronage  rather  than  on
meritable skills.

It is problematic because the impact  of  its  historic  origin  creates  an
uneven distribution of human resources. One will find  an  overconcentration
of people with certain skills in some parts of the country while one  has  a
damning scarcity of such resources in the other parts of the same country.

It is problematic because more often than not one  finds  that,  even  after
the rationalisation process,  policy  implementation  is  the  weakest,  and
clearly because of structural problems. The problem with the  state  of  the
Public Service today is not the workers, and it is not  correct  to  suggest
that, as we restructure, our aim is to deal with the workers or to  retrench
them. In fact, this is a narrow, ill-informed and mischievous conclusion.

The ANC views the Government's restructuring agenda as being all  about  the
reorganisation of the Public Service to inculcate a culture  of  service  in
an  arrangement  where  there  will  be  equitable  distribution  of   human
resources. This state of affairs should suffice to dispel  the  notion  that
the Government's restructuring agenda is all about retrenchment.

Even in unlikely situations  where  interventions  such  as  retraining  and
redeployment  may  not  be  applicable  in  dealing  with   the   particular
circumstances, Government talks about alternative employment of the  workers
who may find themselves in such  situations.  What  members  of  this  House
should be doing is to monitor and perform  their  oversight  role  regarding
the successful implementation  of  the  option  of  alternative  employment,
which is a new option.

What is even encouraging is  that  the  final  steps  of  the  restructuring
process are preceded by departmental personnel audits,  which  will  give  a
picture of each  department.  Such  a  step  should  be  hailed  as  a  fair
arrangement, as people can only reorganise what they know.

The ANC has always advocated the betterment of the  lives  of  all,  workers
included. It is unthinkable that parties that do not have a history  of  the
slightest commitment to such  beliefs  might  say  today  that  the  ANC-led
Government is hellbent on implementing a blanket retrenchment  agenda.  This
indeed is mischievous behaviour.

In  conclusion,  I  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  the
Department of Public Service and Administration  and  organised  labour  for
having negotiated the restructuring deal  we  are  debating  today.  We  are
looking forward to the successful completion of the  restructuring  process.
The ANC supports this process.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  members,  something  about
the atmosphere  in  the  House  reminds  me  of  the  last  day  of  school.
[Interjections.] I wonder why.

The hon the Minister had a few minutes left over when  she  was  making  her
statement, and by agreement amongst all the Whips, she is now going  to  use
up the remainder of the time she had saved.

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Deputy  Chairperson,
I think it is  necessary  to  state  this  afternoon  that  this  particular
transformation process, of which restructuring is a  central  mechanism,  is
probably the most important and yet most difficult  process  that  confronts
the Public Service. It is important because we are going to achieve, if  the
process is correctly followed, the outcome we need in terms of  the  quality
of public service required. It will be difficult because we  expect  a  team
to be engaged in its own restructuring, where we need to review  the  skills
we have in  the  Public  Service,  and  consider  relocation  of  the  human
resources that are there.

There is also a need for us all to ensure  that  we  support  this  process.
Hence, it was a bit regrettable this afternoon that  some  members  of  this
House decided it was a moment to score political points. Unfortunately,  the
volley was pointed in the wrong direction and  it  obviously  came  from  an
incorrect weapon as well.

Let me just very quickly deal with one issue that was raised. I want to  say
to the hon Waters that if he has any thoughts on  advising  the  Government,
he can dream on. There will not be a place for that. I want to also  further
say that, on the issue of sick leave, a mechanism has already  been  put  in
place. We are going to have a disability manager, a management process  that
will actually be monitoring the use of sick leave  in  the  Public  Service,
and will look at trends and ensure appropriate interventions.

The report that has come up is a report that  was  done  over  the  previous
financial year. It is a report that we have  already  responded  to  and  we
have put mechanisms in place. So, he should save those particular  proposals
for his dreams. I think they are well placed there.

In terms of the qualifications of senior managers I thought  that  I  should
raise it here today we have completed the verification of the  qualification
of all senior  managers.  The  Public  Service  Commission  subpoenaed  four
provinces where they had not provided the details, and on being  subpoenaed,
they provided the details. There  were  two  instances  where  there  was  a
misrepresentation of qualifications and those  people  were  dismissed  from
the Public Service. I raise this because I feel  that  it  is  necessary  to
point to the fact that we are definitely trying to ensure  that  we  put  in
place the appropriate systems that are required. But,  in  order  to  effect
the mechanisms that we have developed, we need to ensure  that  we  have  an
appropriately and effectively structured and capacitated Public Service.

We need the right human resources in the  right  places.  Today  I  want  to
appeal, once again, that we all  engage  in  this  important  transformation
process. We would like to make this Public Service the institution  that  is
central to service delivery, the  institution  that  will  ensure  that  the
vision of the developmental state is  taken  forward  and  that  it  is  the
institution that will ensure that governments indeed govern. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                    ISSUES RELATING TO THE AFRICAN UNION

Mr D J SITHOLE: Chairperson, I am grateful to be able to take part again  in
this debate on the African Union. It is our commitment as Africans  to  talk
more about our problems, our dreams and our desires for  the  continent.  We
will not pretend that we are just about  to  resolve  all  the  problems  we
have. The continent  has  committed  itself  to  a  process  to  review  its
performance on issues such as good governance, good economic management  and
the upholding of human rights.

The African Union protocol makes provision for the establishment of a  Peace
and Security Council, and its  functions  will  include  the  early  warning
system, preventative diplomacy, peace-making and peace  support  operations.
The African Commission on Human  and  People's  Rights  is  to  monitor  and
review each performance of state in protecting human  and  people's  rights.
We have the establishment of the Continental Court of Justice to ensure  the
protection of all citizens on the continent from injustice.

The Social and Cultural Council as a civil society  organ,  will  influence,
monitor and evaluate  the  performance  of  governments  and  will  probably
compile reports so that we can all see what is happening on  the  continent.
One of the  important  organs  of  the  African  Union  is  the  Pan-African
Parliament, which will play a critical role in  building  democracy  on  the
continent. Whilst at the beginning it will not have  legislative  power,  it
is hoped that it will evolve and develop to a point where it will make  laws
for the continent.

Having mentioned some of the organs of the African Union,  it  is  important
to note that these organs are established in  terms  of  the  African  Union
Constitutive Act. This means that they are  not  voluntary  but  obligatory.
Each state that has signed and ratified  the  Constitutive  Act  understands
that they have given up some of their sovereignty to the African Union.  The
process of reviewal will not just be an event but will  be  a  process  that
will be ongoing as each organ is fully functional and can  produce  reports.
Therefore, the priority of the African Union is to put in  place  structures
to  deliver  the  objectives  of  the   African   Union   and   enable   the
implementation of Nepad.

Nepad is not an  institution  by  itself  but  a  socioeconomic  development
programme of the African Union. It is important that  we  state  again  that
Nepad is a programme that was approved by the Assembly of  Heads  of  State,
and it is not an organisation in itself. It is not enforceable in  terms  of
the Act because it is a programme. The president of the  ANC  wrote  in  ANC
Today, and I quote:


  Matters of political governance among the member states  of  the  African
  Union are governed by such instruments as the  Constitutive  Act  of  the
  African Union. The various African parliaments, including our  own,  have
  approved this law. As with any law, it is not a voluntary association but
  an obligatory one.

All provisions contained in the Constitutive Act relate mostly to  political
governance  and  they   are   obligatory   to   states,   individually   and
collectively. Those who argue that we should  make  the  Nepad  peer  review
mechanism not voluntarily are, in effect, advocating  that  we  should  make
Nepad a replacement of the African Union. They want  us  to  demobilise  the
African Union to create space for anyone to  negate  the  legal  institution
that we  created  in  the  form  of  the  African  Union.  Hence,  they  are
unprepared to accept the fact that the peer review  mechanism  advocated  in
Nepad will be a voluntary process but, at the same time, we will be able  to
use the AU instruments that are obligatory to review the  same  states  that
will be subject to Nepad reviewal processes.

I must indicate that the African Union is a legal authority and we  are  all
expected to comply with its provisions whilst, at the same time, Nepad is  a
voluntary programme. Therefore, we should resist the temptation  to  replace
the AU with Nepad provisions or a  peer  review  mechanism.  Nepad,  at  all
times, will be used as an instrument that will assist the states  that  will
be weak, and its report will be utilised to assist those  that  are  falling
behind, but it will not be used as an instrument of punishment nor  will  it
be used as an instrument to replace the obligations that each state  has  in
terms of the African Union.

I therefore conclude by saying that it is important for members to read  the
reports that we table as the Working Group of the African Union, because  if
we do not do that we will find ourselves in a situation that I found  myself
in a few weeks ago when addressing a meeting  where  I  had  to  argue  with
members of Parliament about the report that was  tabled  here  and  actually
debated here.

The hon Andries Botha displayed, in that meeting, absolute ignorance of  the
fact that the working group of  Parliament  has  reported  on  a  number  of
issues that affect the African Union. I therefore want to urge  and  request
all members to read the reports we table because it is important for all  of
us to be able  to  articulate  the  correct  position  when  we  go  out  of
Parliament. It is embarrassing when members of Parliament  argue  about  the
report that has been tabled and debated in the House while some  display  an
absolute ignorance of that particular report.

It is my hope that  the  honourable  Andries  Botha  will  be  part  of  the
workshop that is envisaged next year in January, so as to be able to  assist
in his understanding of this matter and  for  him  to  grow  and  understand
where this continent is going.

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, in our quest to  make  this  century  Africa's
time to shine, we are challenged constantly to focus  on  fundamentals.  The
grand dreams and designs for an `Africa awoken' can only be  realised  on  a
sound basis of unity sustainable unity amongst the African countries.

We have repeatedly sketched the objectives  and  principles  of  an  African
Union. To mention some of these objectives and  principles,  we  need  great
attention and I randomly refer to the following: the  achievement  of  unity
and solidarity; the defence and respect of the  sovereignty  of  territorial
integrity and independence of its member states; the promotion of peace  and
security,  including  stability,  on  the  continent;  the  acceleration  of
political and socioeconomic integration;  the  right  of  member  states  to
request intervention from the union in order to restore peace and  security;
the promotion of self-reliance; and last but  not  least,  the  respect  for
democratic principles, human rights, the rule of law, and good governance.

The foregoing clearly reveal the gigantic  task  that  is  facing,  firstly,
each individual African government or country, and secondly, the  collective
effort and commitment of all African states. The task is  enormous,  complex
and urgent. Despite the urgency of the matter, there are,  however,  certain
facts or factors that we need to be aware of. Amilcar Cabral, to quote  him,
would caution thus:


  We must walk rapidly, but not run. We must not be opportunists nor  allow
  our enthusiasm to make us lose the vision of concrete reality. It is more
  important to  begin  with  apparent  delays,  but  with  a  guarantee  of
  continuity than to begin too early or in any moment that  does  not  have
  conditions that guarantee continuity and victory.

We also know that the vision of the AU has triggered off new hope,  visions,
concepts and projects. We simultaneously have to deal with  issues  relating
to  the  establishment  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament,   development   as
envisaged by Nepad which, interestingly, has generated the whole  issue  and
noble idea of the peer group review mechanism.

Another  observation  that  we  need  to  take  into  account  is  that  the
objectives mentioned earlier can never be  realised  if  individual  African
countries do not get their act together,  so  to  speak,  in  regions  under
their jurisdiction, by upholding the imperatives set out by the AU  and  all
related structures and instruments. South Africa  and  other  member  states
should approach the task as partners, not knights in golden  armour  or  the
continent's all-knowing big brother.

The first responsibility of the ANC Government should be to the citizens  of
this  country,  rapidly  and  effectively  making  true  the   delivery   of
responsibilities this  country's  citizens  expect.  We  cannot  incur  huge
expenses for these noble ventures when we cut down on essential  expenditure
within South Africa itself. Neither can we make peace,  not  that  peace  is
unimportant, in far-off regions while there is unease and insecurity in  our
midst. We also do not dispute the adage ...

Matlo go swa mabapi. [People should help each other.]

In dealing  with  our  partner  states,  we  cannot  turn  a  blind  eye  to
corruption, the gross violation of human rights  and  unsavoury  governance.
We acknowledge the fact that there are many ways of dealing  with  problems,
but the latent abuse of power and gross violation of human  rights  and  the
rule of law, the brutalisation of the media and the outright undermining  of
democracy needs to be openly and audibly admonished if not condemned.  South
Africa cannot pussy-foot in challenging Zimbabwe's ZANU-PF while the  entire
citizenry dies of hunger or at the hands of state brutality.

The functions relating to the peer group mechanism need to be  unflinchingly
implemented without fear or favour. Like the  good  work  that  has  already
been done and rendered in the DRC, Burundi etc,  the  ANC  Government  needs
also to facilitate an unbiased process of encouraging dialogue  between  the
ruling forces, members of the opposition party and all  role-players  within
Zimbabwe.

Disunity and chaos in one African country  actually  threatens  the  success
and victory that Africa deserves. The peer group mechanism or  its  contents
should  be  obligatory  across  the  spectrum  of  structures  of   the   AU
initiative.  Socioeconomic  political  monitoring  and  self-monitoring  are
essential for success, peace, stability and  prosperity  on  this  continent
because, simultaneously, there are global challenges out there.

In conclusion, the concepts of the  African  Union,  Pan-African  Parliament
and Nepad need more information dissemination and publicising to  reach  all
sectors of society everywhere  on  this  African  continent,  including  the
sectors of South African society.

Ke le eleletsa matlhogonolo lotlhe ka nako ya tsalo ya Morena  le  ngwaga  o
moswa. [Legofi.] [I wish everybody a happy Christmas and  a  prosperous  New
Year.] [Applause.]]
Mrs A VAN WYK: Mr  Chairman,  the  African  Union  Working  Group  has  been
beavering away, quietly ensuring  that  our  Parliament  remains  integrally
involved in the developing positions  regarding  the  establishment  of  the
African Union and the implementation of Nepad.

It is instructive to observe at these meetings the role that  is  played  by
Madam Speaker and Madam Deputy  Speaker.  For  their  part  in  driving  the
process, I would like to thank them on behalf of my party and  also  express
my  appreciation  for  the  value  added  by  the  extensive   international
understanding and experience of members.

Without the support of also the efficient scribes  and  expert  advisors  we
would not have been able to make progress, and they deserve our gratitude.

This Parliament is making history and the vision on  which  we  should  keep
our eyes firmly set is of an Africa  where  our  peoples  are  educated  and
content, secure in the knowledge that we are safe and able to take  care  of
ourselves, our continent and its affairs. Then we will truly be able  to  be
an equal among our peers.

Die voorlegging gister deur dr Zuma, die Minister van Buitelandse Sake,  het
ons weer 'n vars blik gegee op die noodsaaklikheid van 'n  organisasie  soos
die Afrika Unie en sy program, Nepad. In vele lande is daar beswaarlik  iets
soos 'n parlement of hou hy beswaarlik vergaderings en  neem  die  president
eenvoudig alle besluite. Daar kan ook in sommige gevalle nie werklik van  'n
staat gepraat word in die sin  dat  daar  bewuste  bestuur  en  ontwikkeling
plaasvind nie. Nodeloos om te sê, die begrip van menseregte bestaan  nouliks
op baie plekke.

'n Mens kan nou maklik sê dat daar eers aan sekere voorwaardes vir
lidmaatskap voldoen moet word, maar waar is die slypskool dan? Hoe word die
leierskap van sulke lande tot ander insigte gebring behalwe deur
blootstelling, inwinning en betrokkenheid. Alleenloperbulle in hierdie
kontinent is nie verniet berug nie kry hulle in die trop. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The submission yesterday by Dr Zuma, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, once
again gave us a fresh look at the necessity of an organisation like the
African Union and its programme Nepad. In many countries there is hardly
anything such as a parliament, or it rarely holds meetings and the
president simply takes all the decisions. In some cases one can also not
really talk about a state in the sense that conscious management and
development take place. Needless to say, the concept of human rights barely
exists in many places.

One can easily say that certain prerequisites for membership must be met,
but where is the finishing school then? How will the leadership of such
countries be brought to other insights if not through exposure, convasting
and involvement. Lone bulls on this continent are not infamous for no
reason bring them into the herd.]

It is important that the partners in the G8 and the EU as well as those in
other parts of the world should gain a comprehensive perspective on the
nature and objectives of the peer review mechanisms in the AU as well as in
Nepad.

Discipline does not mean exclusion and punishment. It is a constructive,
educative process with positive objectives and this is how it should be
contextualised. At the same time, it does not mean that the big stick
should be used for firewood. The soft voice of South African diplomacy will
be heard so much more clearly if the recalcitrants know that, inside the
velvet glove, there is the hand of steel, and that the big stick lying so
unobtrusively on the mantelpiece is no mere ornament or perhaps intended
for the braai.

Gister het die Adjunkpresident, soos ook ander met vervelende reëlmaat
doen, in vraetyd weer retories gevra waarom daar soveel besorgdheid oor
Zimbabwe is en nie oor ander dele van Afrika nie. Dié baie deursigtige
gebruik wil eintlik te kenne gee dat daar ander onaanvaarbare redes is
waarom ons bekommerd is en ons motiewe dus so 'n bietjie verdag moet wees.

As dit bedoel is om ons aandag af te lei of om ons stil te maak, dan slaag
dit nie. Die antwoord op die vraag is: Zimbabwe is ons naaste buurman, is
op ons grens, ons mense is verbind deur bloed en taal en goed, deur ons
geskiedenis, deur ons geografie. Dit is ons bure, ons familie, ons vriende,
ons grootste handelsvennoot in Afrika. Ons lotgevalle is intiem met mekaar
verweef. Dit geld vir wit én swart in hierdie land.

Die goeie werk wat hy verder noordwaarts doen, moet voortgaan en behoort
trouens uitgebrei te word om onder meer Soedan en Ethiopië in te sluit.
Maar juis die feit dat Suid-Afrika sy verantwoordelikheid dáár nakom as
leierland van die streek, as voorsitter van die AU en die leier van Nepad,
maak die gebrek daaraan in ons eie kontrei, waar dit ons eie mense ten
nouste, laat ek herhaal, ten nouste raak des te skreiender. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[As others also do with monotonous regularity, yesterday the Deputy
President once again asked rhetorically during Question Time why there is
so much concern about Zimbabwe and not about other sections of Africa. This
very transparent practice actually wants to imply that there are other
unacceptable reasons why we are concerned and our motives must therefore be
a little suspect.

If this is intended to divert our attention or to keep us quiet, then it is
not working. The answer to the question is: Zimbabwe is our closest
neighbour, is on our border, our people are bound by blood and language and
goods, by our history, by our geography. These are our neighbours, our
family, our friends, our largest trading partner in Africa. Our fortunes
are intimately woven together. This applies to white and black in this
country.
The good work he is doing further north must continue and should in fact be
extended to include Sudan and Ethiopia, amongst others. But precisely the
fact that South Africa is meeting its responsibility as a leading country
of the region there, as chairperson of the AU and the leader of Nepad,
makes the lack of the same in our own region, where it affects our own
people most closely let me repeat, most closely all the more glaring.]

The ruling party has ideological and sentimental ties with Mr Mugabe and
Zanu-PF. These should now be used to positive effect. A ruler is as great
as his realm. South Africa is a great country with a great people. They are
behind the leaders and the vision of the AU and Nepad as instruments to
bring Africa into its own. The leaders should now act according to these
mandates and invite Mr Mugabe to Beit Bridge. This has been done before by
people with ideological and sentimental ties. The time has come to do so
again.

The New NP supports the recommendations of the Sixth Report of the African
Union Working Group and commends it to the House for acceptance.
[Applause.]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Mr Chairman, hon Minister, hon members, Africa has been
placed on the world map.

Our continent is no longer a forgotten place, thanks to the efforts of many
people and organisations, especially here in South Africa. Africa has now
rightly claimed a legitimate place on the international agenda, from the
Non-Aligned Movement to the United Nations and even the G8. Africa has
featured prominently this year.

On a wide variety of topics, our continent is now recognised at
international forums and receives significant media coverage. Admittedly,
many still view our continent as a basket case and too many reports and
debates merely highlight what is wrong or perceived to be wrong on the
continent. The onus is, however, on us as South Africans and Africans to
prove the contrary. The successful hosting of the World Summit on
Sustainable Development, for example, was such an effort which illustrated
the vibrancy and the successes of this continent.

In our efforts to build our country and our continent, we must also be
careful not to reject negative reports on Africa out of hand. Let us be
frank about this. We strive to implement Nepad and the African Union
exactly because we are no longer willing to be the hapless victims of
famine, war and corruption. We have committed ourselves to an African
century because we will no longer tolerate the suffering of African people.

Criticism, when it is fair and reasonable, must be accepted so that we as
Africans can address these things. These premises on which we motivate the
African Union place a heavy responsibility upon us. The recent
announcements about the role of the African Union and the political peer
review mechanism under Nepad have further increased our responsibility to
ensure the success of the African Union. Now more than ever, South Africa
will have to demonstrate its commitment to the simultaneous development of
political, social and economic opportunity on the African continent.

The UDM supports an African Union that recognises these principles. We
support an African Union that will be a powerful collective instrument of
Africa to reclaim and take ownership of its destiny. We also support an
African Union that will recognise, address and, if necessary, punish those
on the African continent that fail to respect the ideal of justice, freedom
and equality for every African. The Lota should not be the sole focus of
the AU, but neither can we reasonably expect the African Union to succeed
without appropriate peer review.

Adv Z L MADASA: I would like to thank Madam Speaker not only for the
progress we have made thus far in the working group, but also for giving us
a unique opportunity a historic opportunity to participate in the building
of our continent's institutions. The ongoing conflicts and skirmishes in
some regions of the continent are a painful reminder of the urgency of our
task to help build permanent democratic institutions on the continent,
which can become a legitimate and a credible voice of the large voiceless
majority. We can no longer watch the poor suffer at the hands of corrupt
despotic regimes. Charity should begin at home before we can settle the
vision for the Pan-African Parliament.

What is the vision of our own Parliament? Do we have clarity, domestically,
of the role of Parliament vis-á-vis the executive? Do we have clarity on
the need to separate party-political interests from national interests?
Have we, in our Rules and procedures, fully ventilated the neutrality of
Parliament as encapsulated in section 57 of the Constitution? Unless we
settle the vision of our own Parliament, we are in danger of bringing a
distorted vision about on the continent.

We, as people's representatives, must take bold steps to charter the way
towards the early establishment of democratic institutions on our
continent. In view of the patent reluctance of some heads of states to
subject themselves to political peer review, it is clear that we cannot
rely on intergovernmental negotiations to ensure the promotion of economic
integration and development, but on building democratic institutions.

In conclusion, our Government, as present chair of the African Union, is
therefore seized with the task to lead the continent and must avoid sending
mixed signals on where we stand on the importance of political peer review.
We are already under heavy criticism for being soft on despotic regimes.
Therefore, we have a responsibility to lead the way in the African Union.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, it is said that there is something stronger
than armies: an idea whose time has come. We believe that the idea of an
African Union, African Parliament and Pan-Africanism is something that has
been coming for a very long time. Despite many people denying that this is
a reality for Africa, it has become a reality for Africa, and we know that
no country, no individual in Africa, can resist the fact that this idea has
come and it is its time.

It has been said that the five pillars of the African Union are the
political pillar that emphasises democracy, human rights and justice; the
peace and stability pillar; the development pillar that emphasises
eradication of poverty; the cultural pillar that emphasises who we are and
what we are, and the fact that when that happens, we become a global
player.

Of course, to realise these things, no force must be employed. We must not
be judgmental and accusing and threatening, because this will never bring
the aforementioned about. We cannot force good things on people. We can
encourage them, we can preach about them, and when the time comes, they
will appreciate this.

There was a chief in my area called Chief Sikwati who, in the heyday of
homelands, when the government was busy forcing the chiefs to accept
homeland rule, once said in a meeting: Whoever forces a good thing on
people. Selo se se botse ga se gapeletswe, se a bonwa. [If it is good, we
will see it and it will be done.] I believe this is what should happen in
Africa.

When Africa is developed it will be like green pastures. A peaceful,
prosperous Africa will entice all states of Africa to come and do the right
thing and the good thing, and that is to govern justly and to ensure that
poverty is completely eradicated in Africa and, that therefore, there is no
starvation in Africa anymore.

I believe that we should all pray that this should come about. I believe
that Africa's great day will actually bring prosperity to all of us, even
those who are very reluctant to accept it now.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chair, the establishment of the Pan-African
Parliament is visibly intricate. There are so many aspects to take into
consideration, and now it is not just under the watchful eye of one nation,
but that of Africa and the entire world. The South African involvement in
the Pan-African Parliament and the possibility of hosting the first Pan-
African Parliament meeting in South Africa is extremely pressurising.

The Minority Front firmly supports the concept of participation,
representation and integration of all within Africa. This will surely make
us a strong continent. However, the reality is that strong differences
exist from region to region and we will need the ability to work through
those differences, which are intricate and challenging. For such
differences, a mechanism should be put in place to ensure that it does not
have a strong negative impact on the project, and has a positive result.

The MF, however, believes that through our domestic example of togetherness
and through diversity, the ability to make this work is strong and could
easily produce positive results with the commitment and dedication of all
participating. The situation for the establishment of the Pan-African
Parliament is broad, and there are so many factualities to take into
consideration. Time, however, is of the essence and contributions should be
made swiftly, but wisely, from all sectors, which would contribute to its
success.

The MF accepts and supports the Sixth Report of the Working Group on the
African Union and the Pan-African Parliament.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, in recent times nearly every debate or
question session on the AU or Nepad was dominated by the Zimbabwe issue. I
want to emphasise a specific aspect of this issue today. Let us call it
realities and perceptions, if one so wishes.

During his previous question session, the hon the President frequently
asked: ``Why the focus on Zimbabwe? What about the Ivory Coast?''
Yesterday, the Deputy President asked more or less the same question: ``Why
Zimbabwe, what about Angola?''

President Mbeki once tried to answer this question in Parliament when he
said: ``Why do people want the assurance from me that what has happened in
Zimbabwe will not happen in South Africa? Is it because Zimbabwe has a
black government and South Africa has a black Government?'' And, with that,
it would seem that the President is satisfied that he has spoken the last
word on the issue.

But, the Ivory Coast has a black government, as has Angola. This fact
speaks against the President's assumption. If the hon Jeremy Cronin was
president, I would be even more worried. What then is the real reason for
the concern? Why is Zimbabwe so high up on the agenda of so many people in
South Africa black and white? Let me state only a few.

Zimbabwe is teenaan ons landsgrense. Die kwessie van grond is ook aktueel
in Suid-Afrika met baie radikale aansprake. Zanu-PF en die ANC is ou
``struggle''-vennote. Beide is geakkommodeer deur lande met kommunistiese
regerings. Beide maak 'n groot saak van die ``colonial legacy''. So kan ons
voortgaan.

Die belangrikste egter, meneer, of die persepsies van vrees oor 'n tweede
Zimbabwe gegrond is of nie, persepsies is daar om aangespreek te word.
Persepsies is soms meer vernietigend as die realiteit. En ons president, as
'n gesoute politikus, behoort dit te weet. Sal hy vir een oomblik tydens 'n
verkiesingveldtog persepsies wat hom stemme kan kos, ignoreer bloot omdat
hy dink dit is ongegrond? Nee, hy sal dit aanspreek en verantwoordelik
hanteer. Hoeveel te meer wanneer die vertroue en die toekoms van die land
op die spel is. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Zimbabwe is adjacent to our country's borders. The land question is also
of current interest in South Africa, with many radical claims. Zanu-PF and
the ANC are old `struggle' partners. Both had been accommodated by
countries with communist governments. Both are making a big event of the
colonial legacy. We can carry on like this.

The most important, however, sir, whether the perceptions of fear regarding
a second Zimbabwe are justifiable or not, perceptions have to be addressed.
Perceptions are sometimes more destructive than the reality. And our
President, as an experienced politician, should know that. Would he, even
for a moment during an election campaign, ignore perceptions that could
cost him votes, simply because he thinks they are unfounded? No, he would
address them and handle them responsibly. Even more so when the trust and
the future of the country is at stake.]

I, for one, am not one of the Zimbabwe doom prophets. I  can  give  10  good
reasons why South Africa will not go the Zimbabwe  route.  But,  I  want  to
tell the hon the President that my people do not want to hear  it  from  me.
They want to hear it from the President of this country.

Ms F HAJAIG: Chairperson, colleagues and comrades, it is the end of  another
parliamentary year, and it is appropriate that we plan for next year, 2003.

What are we as South Africans going to contribute to the process  of  making
this an African century? The African Union and  Nepad  constitute  the  ways
and means we have chosen to  take  forward  our  goals,  our  vision  of  an
African Renaissance to indeed make the 21st century an African one.

As hon members know, a working group has been established  to  consider  the
implementation of the Constitutive Act of the  African  Union.  The  working
group is of the view that parliamentarians, as public representatives,  must
be  integrally  involved  in  the  processes  and  discussions  leading   to
positions on  matters  relating  to  the  functioning  of  the  AU  and  the
implementation of Nepad.

The African Union will be  the  engine  that  drives  the  Nepad  programme.
Therefore, it becomes incumbent upon us to  ensure  that  the  functions  of
each organ is thoroughly understood and the linkages between  the  different
organs amplified how the Pan-African Parliament will function,  what  powers
it should have and the important role of civil society. South  Africa  being
the chairperson of the AU, it places a particular responsibility  on  us  to
ensure that the organs are established and function properly.

Colleagues before me have spoken on a number of issues, so I  shall  confine
myself to three. To lay to rest once  and  for  all  some  doubts  of  Afro-
pessimists in this  country  and  abroad,  I  want  to  quote  some  of  the
objectives of the AU. The Constitutive Act of the African Union  in  Article
3 very clearly and unequivocally states that  the  AU  will,  under  section
(e),


  Encourage international co-operation, taking due account of  the  Charter
  of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Under (f), it states that it will


  Promote peace, security and stability on the continent,

and under (g), it states that it will


  Promote democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and
  good governance.

These essential provisions, among others, bind all member states of the
African Union. This means that it is obligatory for all members to
implement these provisions in their respective countries, and mechanisms
are in the process of being worked out and will be put into place for
implementation and monitoring of performance. In addition, Article 23 of
the Constitutive Act provides for the imposition of a sanction if member
states do not comply.

As Nepad is a programme of the African Union, I want to emphasise the role
of women in all the structures of the African Union. The transition of the
continent towards socio, political and economic development cannot succeed
without the active participation of women. Women comprise 52% of the people
on this continent, and to leave them on the margins would be a strategic
mistake.

I submit  that  unless  gender  is  mainstreamed  into  all  programmes  and
structures of the African Union  and  Nepad,  our  development  agenda  will
suffer serious delays. It is our  duty  as  public  representatives  in  our
country and in the  Pan-African  Parliament,  when  it  is  established,  to
ensure that policies and paradigms are put into place that will  enable  and
facilitate the  entry  of  women  into  the  programmes  of  Nepad  and  the
structures of the African Union. Women are the prime movers and key  players
in  African  civil  society  and  labouring  under  discrimination,  unequal
treatment as well as unequal access to opportunities.  The  African  woman's
role and involvement in development and  peacebuilding  has  been  and  will
continue to be crucial to the development of Africa.

Thirdly, one of the  task  teams  of  the  working  group  investigated  the
parameters of regional economic integration.  What  does  regional  economic
integration mean? What structures are needed? How do we strengthen  our  own
regional economic structure, that is, SADC? What is the interaction  between
SADC and other continental economic structures such as Ecowas,  Comesa,  the
Central African Union and the Maghreb states?

We need to start to conceptualise how we can promote inter-African trade  to
promote investment across Africa between  African  states  and  to  help  to
build infrastructure  development.  All  this  must  be  encouraged.  We  as
parliamentarians in this Parliament need to put our minds to it.

To make Africa self-sustaining, we  need  to  look  to  strengthen  regional
bodies and then  holistically  chart  the  interaction  between  states  and
regions.

We stand at the threshold of a very exciting period in the life  of  Africa.
Let us work together and make it happen. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  As  the  Minister  of  Minerals  and
Energy is still not in the House, I ask the Deputy Chief Whip whether he  is
going to move that the next Order be given precedence.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Chairperson,  I  move,  but  I
just want to point out that the next Order of business is  the  Intelligence
Bill? Is it not?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: We will now move to the  consideration
of the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Mr Chairperson, I move that  we
give precedence to the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Do  we  have  acceptance  for  that
precedence?

Hon MEMBERS: Yes.

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, I apologise. We are caught a little bit  unawares
here. Can you explain to us what is happening this afternoon?  Why  have  we
gone straight on to the consideration of Bills when we actually do have  the
statement from the Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs next on the  Order
Paper? We have not been informed of this at all. I really do not  know  what
the programme is for this afternoon now.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That is why I  asked  for  the  Deputy
Chief Whip to ask that the next Order be given precedence.  The  matter  was
then proposed to the  House.  The  House  accepted  it,  and  the  Chair  is
therefore proceeding on the basis of that.

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, you may be of the impression that the  House  did
agree to it, but it  came  as  a  total  and  utter  surprise.  It  was  not
something that was discussed with the Whips of  the  opposition  parties  at
all. While you may have been informed, I want to say that we were not.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The Minister is here. I think what  we
will do, since we have now given precedence, is to proceed  with  the  other
matter. I do think that we  maybe  concluded  the  other  debates  a  little
earlier than might have been expected.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairperson, may I ask for your indulgence? I wonder if  we
could not go back to the Order Paper as it was? One of our  members  who  is
due to speak in the debate on the mineral and energy affairs matter  is  due
to  catch  an  aeroplane  fairly  shortly,  and   everything   was   planned
accordingly. [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: What we will  do  now  is  finish  the
Order that is in front of us, since there will be no speakers, and  it  will
not erode the time that we have.

                       MEDICAL SCHEMES AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Consideration of Bill)

There was no debate.

Bill agreed to.

       STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY ON BROADBASED
          SOCIOECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT CHARTER FOR SA MINING INDUSTRY

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson, hon Deputy  President  and
hon members, I apologise for any confusion that I may have caused.

It is an honour for me to stand here  today  to  make  a  statement  on  the
Broadbased Socioeconomic Empowerment Charter for the Mining Industry,  which
is a negotiated product of the  Government  and  the  industry  led  by  the
Chamber of Mines, NUM and the SA Mining Development Association, which is  a
representative body of junior and small  miners,  and  the  Royal  Bafokeng,
which represents the rural communities  and  was  later  joined  by  foreign
investors who, also, were part of concluding the charter.

What we have now is not a  Government  document  but  a  document  that  was
drafted by all stakeholders  and  it  reflects  the  compromises  that  were
reached. Everybody lost and gained something  during  the  negotiations,  as
usual. But, the charter does not only have a standing in law as it  is  now,
it is also a consensus document that has the same status in  our  minds  and
hearts in the mining industry as the outcomes that we  reached  and  adopted
after the mining summit. It has the  same  feeling  that  we  had  with  the
mining summit  when  we  referred  to  the  mining  industry  as  a  sunrise
industry.

The Mining Charter is a chapter in the book of South African mining  reforms
aimed at rebuilding the South African mining industry into  a  21st  century
industry whose bottom line is people, the planet  and  profits.  Our  mining
reforms have included environmental reforms.  Members  will  know  what  has
happened in the environmental scene. The  reforms  have  included  improving
mine  health  and  safety  conditions  and  providing  one   of   the   most
comprehensive Mine Health and Safety Acts. They  are  now  also  looking  at
issues, people and communities.

Mining has been and still is the backbone of  South  Africa's  economy.  The
city  of  Kimberley  is  there  because  of  diamond  mining.  The  city  of
Johannesburg  is  there  because  of  mining.  Many  other  initiatives  and
nonmining industries in South Africa exist because of mining.  Members  will
recall  that  in  section  100  of  the  Minerals  and  Petroleum  Resources
Development Act, it was stated that the  Minister  of  Minerals  and  Energy
should develop the broadbased socioeconomic empowerment  charter  that  will
set  a  framework,  targets  and  timetables  for  effecting  the  entry  of
historically disadvantaged persons of South Africa into the mining  industry
specifically. We were supposed to  do  that  within  six  months  after  the
President had signed the Act, but we have been able to do it  in  less  than
three months. Regarding that, I  think  that  the  industry  and  all  other
stakeholders need to be congratulated. [Applause.]

Today I am here to update members about the progress  that  has  been  made.
Hon members are aware that there was a leaked version of the charter,  which
caused considerable anxiety and, in many ways,  it  set  us  back.  However,
that was a nonstatus paper. What we now  have  is  a  truly  negotiated  and
Government-supported document, which is what I was instructed to do  in  the
Act. The people who have negotiated the charter that we now  have  consisted
of Government, labour, business both large and small, and international  and
representatives of the community. In that way,  it  is  truly  an  inclusive
South African document.

Why is this a broadbased socioeconomic empowerment charter?  It  is  because
it goes beyond  black  empowerment.  It  will  not  just  only  benefit  the
consortia in the usual way, but it will also  benefit  workers  through  the
share-ownership schemes; poor rural communities which will be  targeted  for
development; small and medium-sized business which will  not  be  in  mining
but in supplier industries; and students  and  employees  who  will  receive
training and skills and therefore upward mobility in the industry.  It  will
also benefit the country through beneficiation, which will  ensure  that  we
keep more jobs in South Africa as  we  manufacture  and  add  value  to  our
minerals in South Africa. It will also mean that we can bring  investors  to
South Africa not only in mining but also  in  beneficiation.  It  will  also
address the conditions and setbacks in our communities,  which  were  caused
by the migrant labour system through ensuring  that  not  only  the  housing
conditions but also the nutritional status of our workers are addressed,  as
well as the discriminatory practices against foreign workers in  the  mining
industry.

Young and old professionals, black and white, will be  able  to  collaborate
and form small and junior companies in  mining  as  strategic  partners  who
will then build their own new medium-sized companies, which will be able  to
participate in the mining industry. The charter makes a commitment  to  have
10% women representation in the industry within the first five years.  I  am
not asking women in Parliament to leave  Parliament  for  mining.  It  is  a
truly broadbased socioeconomic empowerment partner because of the number  of
people that it targets and the benefits that it will bring to  the  country.
Hon members have also been empowered because I am sure  that  they  will  be
very satisfied with the products that they have guided us to produce.

I would like to highlight the pillars of the charter. The  first  pillar  is
human resource development. Through that pillar, within five years, we  will
be able to create workers who are literate and  numerate.  We  will  provide
scholarships and learnerships to the workers and people who are outside  the
industry so that they can come into  the  industry  as  workers.  Employment
equity, which is the second pillar, will ensure that within five years,  40%
of people who work in the mining industry  as  junior  and  senior  managers
will represent the designated groups. The third pillar  is  procurement.  We
will ensure  that  there  is  preferred  supplier  status  for  historically
disadvantaged people regarding capital goods, service goods and  consumable.
That will ensure, again, that we have SMEEs and big players who  will  enter
the supplier industry, which is very big in South Africa.

Regarding joint ventures and employee shares in ownership category  and  for
broadening participation in the mining industry, historically  disadvantaged
people will have substantive minorities in existing operations by  having  a
minimal equity of 26% in 10 years.  Within  this  26%  of  equity,  employee
shares will also be accommodated in order to ensure worker participation  at
equity level.  The  industry  has  committed  itself  to  facilitating  R100
billion to mitigate the risk involved in such transactions. What  this  will
mean, simply, is that each partner will ensure that the empowerment  partner
who comes into business with them will have at least 15% of risk  that  will
be managed either by guaranteeing and pledging the assets of the company  or
ensuring that the repayment method that is established will  be  comfortable
to the new entrant so that, overall, the risk profile of  the  new  entrants
will not be increased by  the  fact  that  they  have  unsuitable  financial
arrangements. Our own IDC and many other bankers that we  met  have  pledged
to support this initiative.

The fifth pillar is about housing and ensuring that we are able  to  reverse
some of the negative effects of migrant labour. In that regard, we  will  be
looking  at  the  standard  of  housing,  including  upgrading  of  hostels,
conversion of hostels into family units and the promotion of home  ownership
options for mine employees. Again, like any other South Africans, those  who
qualify for the state subsidy will also be considered  in  that  regard.  We
will also be able to establish and  improve  nutrition  schemes  within  the
areas in which miners work  in  order  to  address  the  concern  about  the
nutritional status of some of  our  workers,  especially  in  the  light  of
HIV/Aids.

The sixth pillar will be about uplifting communities and rural  development.
In that regard, Government, labour and business  will  ensure  that  in  the
dense labour-sending areas, previously mining areas which we  usually  refer
to as ghost towns and in the host  communities  where  mining  is  currently
taking place, we will have  effective  co-ordinated  development  programmes
that will be aimed at eradicating poverty as well as focusing especially  on
infrastructure development.

The seventh pillar is  beneficiation.  To  increase  value  addition  within
South Africa, create jobs and attract investments  in  beneficiation,  every
company will ensure  and  cause  beneficiation  in  its  own  sector  to  be
accomplished in South Africa. An agreed amount  of  raw  materials  will  be
value-added  through  the  contribution  of  all  South  African  companies.
Government will, however, negotiate on a case-by-case basis  to  accommodate
difficulties that may arise in specific minerals  while  ensuring  that  the
objectives of the Bill are met. Simply put, it means that we  will  not  ask
people who are producing coal to make earrings and jewellery.

We will also ensure that  in  situations  where  a  particular  company,  in
respect of its  business  plan  and  other  considered  objectives  of  that
company, cannot meet its objectives, suitable arrangements will be  made  so
that that company will still continue to contribute to  the  overall  impact
and the goals of the charter and Bill. I have  to  state  that  it  will  be
possible to offset beneficiation  with  equity.  Simply  put,  again,  in  a
situation where a company, for any reason that  is  credible,  has  problems
with meeting its equity objective, we will expect that company  to  do  much
more in beneficiation. The only reason  we  accommodate  that  is  that,  in
beneficiation,  we  create  new  jobs.  We  go  downstream  and  bring  more
technology. In many ways, it is a higher form of value that  we  create  for
the country. However, for any other aspect of the charter,  that  cannot  be
offset.

We have just come back from a road show where  we  visited  investors,  fund
managers and people who were concerned about the leaked charter. I  want  to
say that I led a dream team, which consisted of departmental officials,  the
Chamber of Mines, the  SA  Mineral  Development  Association,  the  Bafokeng
nations, the IDC and the banking fraternity. We were  joined  in  London  by
South African banks who are also located in London as well as  some  British
and international banks that operate in South Africa as a support team.

In the four days in London, we met more than 300 people who  attended  large
and small meetings that we addressed.  We  presented  the  foreign  audience
with one voice from the South African mining stakeholder delegation. It  was
a Government-led delegation but not a Government-dominated  delegation.  All
the stakeholders had a voice of their own in the discussions  and  they  all
protected the charter equally. Some people in the audience were  stunned  by
the unity of purpose that we were able to display and by  how  far  we  have
come on this issue as different stakeholders. I am  truly  thankful  to  the
delegation. During that trip, I was truly proud to be a  South  African  and
to work with such outstanding persons.

In general, the questions and the concerns that were raised by the  audience
included the need to assure them on  the  clarity  and  overall  empowerment
strategy of Government, in particular the  timeframes  and  target.  In  the
case of mining, they needed to know whether the  26%  in  10  years  is  not
going to be revised. We were able to say we will  not  revise  that  because
Government is confident that if we achieve the critical mass  in  10  years,
many entrepreneurs will come out of our communities and they  will  be  able
to take into the industry and to  participate  on  a  willing-buyer-willing-
seller basis. We  also  gave  assurance  that  the  scorecard  that  we  are
developing is only an administrative  tool  and  we  will  not  include  new
issues between the seven pillars that I have  just  referred  to.  That  was
also comforting.

The audience wanted to know what would be in the money Bill.  We  were  able
to echo the words of the Minister in the Treasury that, in the  money  Bill,
we will only be able to  show  that  South  Africa  is  sustaining  its  tax
policy, which is already very  credible.  Therefore,  our  money  Bill  will
ensure that we have a royalty regime that is competitive and  comparable  to
any other mining regime in the world.

There was constant concern about  whether  Government  will  force  discount
when those shares are sold. We were able to prove  beyond  reasonable  doubt
that BEE transactions  that  have  been  undertaken  in  this  country  have
happened at arm's-length, and Government has had nothing to  do  with  where
the private sector was transacting. In fact, the  people  from  the  banking
industry that were  in  our  delegation  and  the  people  from  the  mining
industry were able to elaborate on that  matter  even  much  further.  There
were concerns about whether the introduction of BEE in the  mining  industry
would lead to value leakage or value subtraction.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the noise levels are  too
high. We cannot hear the Minister.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, again, the members of my  delegation,  especially
those from the finance sector,  were  able  to  give  stunning  examples  of
progress that has been made in the mining industry  where  there  was  value
addition, no value leakage and no  value  subtraction.  The  examples  given
were that of African Rainbow Minerals, which is the number one  business  in
South Africa, as was voted by its peers and NDC, Eyethu, Eyesizwe, etc.  All
those examples prove beyond reasonable doubt that mining companies that  are
black and which are in joint ventures or  operate  alone  create  value.  In
fact, the fact that African Rainbow Minerals was able  to  take  loss-making
shafts from Anglo American and turn them  into  mines  that  are  profitable
stunned some of the audience. Therefore, the issue of value  subtraction  by
BEE fell away.

They also needed certainty about how and when they  would  be  able  to  see
broad empowerment across the sectors in South Africa because, in  that  way,
they would be assured that our whole empowerment thrust had been taken  care
of, and they would like to work with us in order for us to achieve that.  Of
course, the Minister of Trade and Industry will be  making  an  announcement
on that issue quite soon.

One of the things that we brought back with us from that trip was  the  need
for constant communication with  the  stakeholders'  so-called  markets  who
were able to understand where South African policy is coming from  and  also
able to get first-class insight into how comprehensive and co-ordinated  our
policy is. In that respect, I feel that we have truly been able to  go  back
to the market and to assure them that our mining reforms are on track.

I want to thank the members in  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Minerals  and
Energy, and the chairpersons both in this House and  in  the  NCOP  for  the
sterling leadership that they have given us so that  we  are  able  to  make
this statement. I would  also  like  to  thank  those  who  participated  in
drafting the charter and those who have been able to be  critics  along  the
way because, without their criticisms, we would not have made  some  of  the
adjustments that we have made along the way.

Another team led by the director-general is on  its  way  to  New  York  and
Canada to address investors in those  countries.  My  Deputy  Minister  will
also lead a delegation to Australia in order to promote the charter  and  to
win more friends for South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Chairperson, first of all, I congratulate the  Minister  on
a document which, after a  problematic  birth,  is  finally  one  which  all
stakeholder feel comfortable to endorse.

It is common knowledge  that  a  well-functioning  market  economy  requires
policy,  predictability  and  a  credible  operational  framework.  In  this
regard, the Mining Charter is a pragmatic foundation for the  resolution  of
some critical and competing imperatives.
These two imperatives encompass, firstly, a political imperative, namely  to
change the economy from one owned, led and run predominantly by  whites,  to
one that is truly nonracial, and, secondly,  and  equally  importantly,  the
demand in reality of the need for economic growth, because without  economic
growth, there are no jobs.

It is perhaps with a view to striking a balance  between  these  imperatives
that the  first  draft  of  the  charter  released  on  July  19  failed  so
miserably. It is a matter of public record that the  document  led  to  more
than R100 billion being wiped off mining stocks on both the London  and  the
Johannesburg Stock Exchanges.

Perhaps the one useful, but very expensive, lesson  that  Government  learnt
from this exercise is that  capital,  particularly  investment  capital,  is
highly mobile. If a favourable investment  environment  is  not  created  by
Government, then capital  will  just  go  elsewhere  where  the  risk-reward
relationship is more enticing, and that is exactly what happened.

Let me be quite clear: The DA  believes  that  black  participation  in  the
mining industry is highly desirable no, crucial. It is  the  precise  nature
and  speed  of  transformation  that  is  important,   and   balancing   the
imperatives is critical. In this respect, the new  charter  is  light  years
away from the first draft. It is  left  I  believe  deliberately  vague,  in
order to promote a high degree of flexibility. While targets  are  set,  the
implementation of it is left flexible, the product being quite  correctly  a
product of negotiation between Government and the other stakeholders.

The charter adopts a  scorecard  approach.  Firstly,  mining  companies  are
given credit for empowerment deals they have  already  completed.  Secondly,
the various pillars of transformation which are  importantly  specified  can
be set off against one another. I will not embroider on  those  because  the
Minister indeed set out what those pillars are.

But what is important is that when Government is called upon to process  the
mining licence convergence from old-order rights to  new-order  rights,  all
these aspects of transformation will be recognised on the  scoreboard.  What
is important, however, is that  the  weighting  of  these  criteria  is  not
prescribed, nor is  the  level  of  set-off.  For  example,  what  level  of
beneficiation is required to offset what proportion  of  the  26%  ownership
requirement? Likewise, no mention is  made  of  the  specific  weighting  in
respect of passive and active ownership.

Having said all this, the  charter  is  an  important  document.  It  is  an
important document not only in respect  of  mining  but  also  in  terms  of
future social and economic development in South Africa.

But, I suppose, one thing that I have to say is that there is a downside  to
this, which is what the  Minister  has  not  said,  and  that  is  the  huge
discretion that she will have. But I hope that the Minister has  learnt  and
that that learning process has been a steep process.  Firstly,  I  hope  she
has learnt that the mining industry will just not  accept  the  dictates  of
this Government, or any government, for that matter. It is just too big  and
too powerful, and it contributes too much to the wealth of this nation.

Secondly, international investment capital is just far too mobile to be  the
capture of any one country. We cannot afford  another  R 100  billion  wiped
off the value of our industry. I hope in future when the Minister  comes  to
look upon granting of licences, this  burden  weighs  very  heavily  on  her
decisions. [Time expired.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Chairperson, hon members, the  agreement  reached  between
the Government, the mining industry and labour on  this  mining  empowerment
charter represents great progress in the future of our young democracy.

This is one of the massive industries of our country and  a  very  important
cornerstone of our economy. This charter now opens  economic  doors  to  the
historically disadvantaged South Africans to participate  and  to  share  in
the economy of this country. The word ``negotiation'' has again  proved  its
success where the Department of Minerals and Energy, the  mining  industries
and labour were able to reach agreement on a matter  that  was  filled  with
sensitivity and also with uncertainty at the time.

The latter, of course, was reflected in  the  unfortunate  incident  of  the
draft charter that was leaked to the media,  thus  giving  rise  to  concern
that nationalisation and the so-called wiping out of billions of rands  from
the mining companies, to the detriment of its shareholders, was possible.
However, the final agreement reached in this charter is a  good  example  of
how opposing views and positions can be  settled  through  negotiations  and
compromise. Certainly, there will still be  differences  of  approach  among
the three parties,  but  that  is  the  nature  of  give  and  take  in  any
negotiation process.

What does the charter mean? To the historically disadvantaged groupings,  it
spells out progress, ownership and joint ventures and opportunities. To  the
established mining industries, it may, unfortunately, spell out  uncertainty
in respect of Government's transformation agenda and its specific goals.  It
is our duty as South Africans, however, to assist in  making  this  economic
transaction as smooth and as painless as possible. Of course, it is  also  a
fact of life that change, in whatever  form,  is  never  acceptable  to  all
people at all times.

The other important issue that we must guard against is  that  this  charter
should not be  a  window-dressing  exercise.  More  so,  we  appeal  to  the
Minister to be vigilant  and  to  see  to  it  and  monitor  that  there  is
absolutely no fronting during this transformation and  empowerment  process.
Ownership participation will not be enough,  as  it  is  also  important  to
build capacity and transfer skills in a meaningful and long-lasting  manner.
If both parties remain committed to the latter, the spirit  of  the  charter
will, indeed, benefit all South Africans.

Finally, I would like to express the IFP's admiration  and  appreciation  to
the department for its foresight in promoting this charter. It is now up  to
the Government, labour and the industry  to  ensure  that  it  bears  fruit,
irrespective of race. colour, gender or whatever.

Mr A H NEL: Mr Chairperson, I  know  of  no  one,  no  political  party,  no
participant in the mining industry, and for that matter,  no  one  of  sound
mind who does not agree that we must have a more equitable  distribution  of
all the resources in our country. Therefore,  I  want  to  congratulate  the
Minister and the industry for the final form of the empowerment  charter.  I
want to stress the final form because, in the end, I think, we can say  that
common sense prevailed.

The preparation and the unfortunate leaking of what I  would  call  the  51%
empowerment charter is a lesson to us all of how not and what not to do.  It
only wiped R45 billion of the JSE's resources index and scared off a lot  of
potential investors.

Gelukkig het die President, die Minister en  die  groot  rolspelers  in  die
mynbedryf kopgehou, en 'n regverdige ooreenkoms bereik.  Die  feit  dat  die
Minister, saam met die industrie, die moeite gedoen het om ook  die  handves
oorsee te bemark, en vrese uit die weg te gaan ruim, is tot  Suid-Afrika  se
voordeel. Positiewe aspekte van die handves, wat ek wil beklemtoon,  is  dat
die Regering slegs 'n fasiliteringsrol in die verandering  van  die  profiel
van eienaarskap sal speel, en sal toelaat dat die mark  die  sleutelrol  sal
hê in die bemarking daarvan. Dit  sal  goed  ontvang  word  deur  potensiële
buitelandse beleggers.

Die erkenning dat  die  oordra  van  eienaarskap  in  die  industrie  op  'n
deursigtige  manier  en  teen  regverdige  markpryse  sal  geskied,  is   te
verwelkom. So ook is dit te verwelkom  dat  die  handves  'n  verbreding  in
bemagtiging teweeg wil bring sodat nie  net  enkelinge  nie,  maar  'n  breë
spektrum van voorheen benadeeldes daarby baat  sal  vind.  Die  uiteindelike
sukses  sal  bepaal  word  deur,  eerstens,  hoe  buigsaam  en  soepel   die
toepassing van die handves en die wet bestuur word,  en  tweedens,  nie  net
die verbreding van die eienaarskap  nie,  maar  ook  die  vermeerdering  van
belegging  in  die  mynindustrie.  [Applous.]  (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Fortunately the President, the Minister and the major role-players  in  the
mining industry kept their cool and reached a fair agreement. The fact  that
the Minister, together with the  industry,  went  to  the  trouble  of  also
marketing the charter overseas and allying fears  is  to  the  advantage  of
South Africa. Positive aspects of the charter, which I  want  to  emphasise,
are the fact that the Government will  play  only  a  facilitating  role  in
changing the profile of ownership and that it will allow the market to  play
the key role in its marketing. This  will  be  well  received  by  potential
overseas investors.

The recognition that the transfers of ownership  in  the  industry  will  be
done in a transparent way and at fair  market  prices  is  to  be  welcomed.
Similarly it is to be welcomed that the  charter  seeks  to  bring  about  a
broadening of empowerment so that not only  individuals  but  also  a  broad
spectrum  of  formerly  disadvantaged  people  will  benefit  from  it.  The
ultimate success will be determined, firstly, by the degree  of  flexibility
with which the application of the  charter  and  the  Act  is  managed,  and
secondly, not only by broadening ownership but  also  increasing  investment
in the mining industry. [Applause.]]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson, in record  time,  the  hon  the  Minister  has
already consulted with all stakeholders in the mining industry and  she  has
been able to formulate this  Broadbased  Socioeconomic  Empowerment  Charter
for the South African Mining Industry.

Someone said during  the  public  hearings  on  the  Mineral  and  Petroleum
Resources Development  Bill  that  the  devil  is  in  the  details.  It  is
gratifying to note that the charter is a product of various stakeholders  in
the mining industry. There is no doubt that  the  goal  of  the  empowerment
charter  is  to  create  an  industry  that   will   proudly   reflect   the
constitutional requirement by ensuring that the nation's  mineral  resources
are developed in an orderly and ecologically sustainable manner.

There is clearly no devil  in  the  detail  in  the  implementation  of  the
Mineral  and  Petroleum  Resources  Development  Act,  which  has  now  been
assented to by the President. The policy objective stated  in  the  Minerals
and Petroleum Resources Development Act  are  adequately  addressed  in  the
socioeconomic empowerment charter, which has been presented  in  this  House
by the hon the Minister this afternoon.

The UDM notes with appreciation that Government guarantees  and  undertakes,
in the South African bilateral relations and  agreement  with  the  relevant
countries,  training  opportunities,  particularly  for   the   historically
disadvantaged  South  Africans,  and  exchange  opportunities  with   mining
companies operating outside South Africa.

With regard to the provision of training in mining  entrepreneurial  skills,
the charter addresses the concerns raised during the public hearings. It  is
now very clear that  it  is,  indeed,  not  the  Government's  intention  to
nationalise the mining industry. This is indeed very  commendable.  The  UDM
supports the adoption of this Broadbased Socioeconomic  Empowerment  Charter
for the South African Mining Industry. [Time expired.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues, the  earlier  version
of the charter had a  damaging  effect  on  the  South  African  economy  as
investor confidence was negatively impacted. Now, the  question  is  whether
the latest  and  much  improved  version  will  manage  to  remove  investor
suspicion and instil greater trust in South African markets.

Presently, however,  some  uncertainty  and  insecurity  appears  to  remain
despite agreement by all stakeholders  on  the  general  principles  of  the
charter. The ACDP  supports  the  economic  and  social  objectives  of  the
charter, and it is our hope that the mining industry will recover  and  play
a valuable role in contributing to the economic growth of this country.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, many South Africans are  not  really  clear
on the factualities that this department covers and, given its  name  alone,
the responsibility sounds complex and scientific.  This  calls  for  greater
coverage of departments' responsibilities and  duties  in  terms  that  will
allow the greater majority of illiterate South Africans to understand it.

Accountability,  transparency  and   values   firmly   indicate   that   our
Constitution is entrenched in all Government activities. The  department  is
applauded for being part of this process and for efficiently doing so.
The MF expresses a need that the department not  only  report  back  on  its
activities and performance but ensures that, given the  complexity  of  this
task, the citizenry is made to understand the clarity that  can  be  reached
on a simple level of such understanding of the activity.

The criticism of Government in a negative light has  also  contributed  much
to the inability of the society to grasp  and  understand  the  governmental
process and its intricacies.

The MF, however, applauds the department on its many positive  results,  and
wishes the department well in its future endeavours. [Time expired.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, I am glad the hon  the  Minister  made  clear  the
issue of the premature leak to the media concerning the  previous  document.
The question sometimes arises: Is it not a tactic  of  the  ANC  to  send  a
radical document as a flyer to test the water to see how far  they  can  go?
In the meantime, the markets and the value  of  the  rand  have  to  take  a
hammering. Hon members must remember that any document can  be  leaked,  and
should let the first one be a reasonable one. We are not bargaining  on  the
Oriental Plaza. We are busy with the matters of the country.

I have two questions directed  to  the  hon  the  Minister.  She  said  that
preferred suppliers status will be afforded  to  historically  disadvantaged
South African companies. Is that over and  above  the  stipulations  of  the
Preferential Procurement Act of 2000 or within those parameters? The  second
question is, based on the 40% ADSA participation in both junior  and  senior
management positions within five years, what will the  consequences  be  for
the existing management personnel? [Time expired.]

Mr T M GONIWE: Chairperson, hon members and the hon the  Minister,  I  would
like to start by congratulating the Minister and her  department  for  their
pioneering work and vision in furthering the process  of  transformation  of
our  economy.  The  first  significant  achievement  was  the  Liquid  Fuels
Charter, which set a standard for consensus on  transformation.  The  mining
charter takes the process much further  and  is  a  landmark  in  empowering
previously disadvantaged South Africans.

Furthermore, the Minister and her  team  managed  to  complete  the  charter
process in a record of three months, six full months ahead of  the  deadline
imposed by legislation. For this,  we  thank  MaMlambo  very  much  and  the
President  for  supporting  her,  and  most  importantly,   we   thank   the
organisation she comes from the ANC.

While we are proud of the achievements of pioneers in the  mining  industry,
such as Tokyo Sexwale and  Patrice  Motsepe,  both  of  whom  were  recently
recognised for their splendid achievements, the  charter  seeks  to  broaden
empowerment, to involve communities, co-operatives,  family  trusts  and  so
forth. This is most welcomed, because this  is  in  line  with  the  current
definition and understanding of black economic empowerment.

The charter will bring about  transformation  in  a  number  of  areas.  The
mining industry is not only the cornerstone of our economy but has also,  in
its  management  and  its  ownership,  been  a  historically  and  exclusive
preserve  of  a  small  white  elite.  Everyone  recognises  that  this   is
unsustainable.

The charter seeks to address the historical exclusion  of  the  majority  of
South Africans by setting clear and realistic targets of  ownership  15%  in
five years and 26% by 2012. Even now as we speak, the mining  industry  lags
quite a long way behind the rest of the economy in terms  of  transformation
in middle and upper management.

The Department of Labour's most recent employment equity report  ranked  the
mining industry at the bottom of 25 sectors. Most of the ownership  patterns
in the industry are still very much the same. The charter sets a clear  goal
of having a representation of 40% historically disadvantaged South  Africans
in management within five years and a target of 10% for  women.  These  must
be seen as minimums and not maximums, we urge.

Other significant goals of  the  charter  are  the  improvement  in  working
conditions as well as the  promotion  of  the  development  initiatives  for
communities in mining and labour-sending areas like the  Eastern  Cape.  The
mining charter is not only a milestone for the mining industry, it  has  set
a new standard for empowerment and transformation. The notion of  broadbased
socioeconomic empowerment goes a  long  way  beyond  merely  owning  shares,
equity holding and addresses issues such as development, employment  equity,
capacity-building, promotion of beneficiation and working conditions.

Black economic empowerment must be the  empowerment  of  a  broad  range  of
previously  disadvantaged  South  Africans.  This  new  broadbased  approach
involves not only the transfer of ownership  but,  at  the  same  time,  the
transformation of the structure  of  the  industry  itself  to  create  more
opportunities for investment, more economic growth, more jobs, more  skilled
workforce and a better environment.

One of the strengths of the South African mining companies is that they  are
part of the global industry. Mining houses that originated here have  assets
all over  the  world.  We  should  take  advantage  of  these  in  terms  of
investments and training opportunities.

The process of empowerment should not stop at our borders. We want to  plead
that the historically advantaged people must take the disadvantaged  persons
also into consideration when they make deals abroad. [Applause.]

  INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BILL, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL;
        NATIONAL STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE AMENDMENT BILL AND ELECTRONIC
                   COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY (Pty) Ltd BILL

                          (Consideration of Bills)

Dr S C CWELE: Chairperson, our understanding is that  all  the  Bills,  with
amendments from the NCOP, were accepted by all parties  with  the  exception
of the National Strategic Intelligence  Amendment  Bill,  Bill  No:  S1D  of
2002.

This Bill strengthens our intelligence structures for  better  co-ordination
of our intelligence, protection of information of state departments and  for
vetting or security screening investigations  in  order  to  neutralise  the
effectiveness of foreign intelligence or  hostile  intelligence  operations.
Secondly,  it  aims  to  protect  the  intelligence   and   any   classified
information and,  lastly,  to  counter  subversion,  treason,  sabotage  and
terrorism against the state and its people.

This Bill, unlike  in  other  countries,  outlines  the  vetting  in  detail
instead of hiding this important function in the regulations. This  is  done
in order to inform individuals who may be subject to vetting  through  their
interaction with the state on what to expect in  these  security  competency
investigations.  The  Bill  provides  for  the  vetting  of  employees   and
applicants to the state on request by the head of the organ  of  the  state.
The Bill also provides for vetting of contract  workers  of  the  state  but
only if they have access to classified information or if  they  have  access
to national key points.
Only the DP has a problem with this Bill. The DP is  opposed  to  this  Bill
because it wants to limit the vetting of the applicants or employees of  the
state only if they have access to classified  information  or  national  key
points. They do this knowing very well that the  organs  of  state  are  the
custodians  of  not  only  classified   information   but   also   sensitive
information. Full-time  employees  of  the  state  have  more  latitude  and
opportunities to access sensitive information and sensitive areas which  are
not necessarily classified but  have  a  potential  to  compromise  national
security.

The DP's ultimate intention is to create confusion and  render  the  process
ineffective because this creates loopholes for endless legal  challenges  of
the vetting process. Why should an  African  or  South  African  weaken  the
capacity  of  the  state  to  protect  itself  from   foreign   or   hostile
intelligence? Why should South Africans want the people of South  Africa  to
be exposed to criminals and those  who  are  working  against  our  national
security and interests?

It is high  time  that  the  DP  stops  working  for  the  interest  of  the
foreigners or extreme right-wingers. Now is the time  for  the  DP  to  stop
viewing themselves as Europeans and  allow  themselves  to  be  grounded  as
Africans and to promote the national interests  of  all  peace-loving  South
Africans.  The  ANC  calls  upon  all  our  patriots  and  on  the   DP   as
representatives of our people to support this Bill and the  amendments  from
the NCOP. The ANC support  the  National  Strategic  Intelligence  Amendment
Bill and the other Bills amended by the NCOP. [Applause.]

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Chairperson, hon members  and  the  Minister,  I  am
going to confine my speech to the National Strategic Intelligence Bill,  the
one that has just been mentioned by the chairperson of the  committee.  This
Bill gives the National Intelligence Agency the right  to  conduct  security
screening investigations into any person employed by or applying for  a  job
with any organ of state. The Bill  also  allows  the  NIA  to  make  use  of
polygraphs in conducting its investigations.

These provisions give the NIA sweeping powers  to  violate  the  privacy  of
perfectly harmless individuals. There is no good reason  for  Parliament  to
give the NIA these powers. On the contrary,  there  are  compelling  reasons
not to. I ask the House to consider the implications of the Bill before  it.
The Constitution defines an organ of state  as  a  department  of  state  or
administration in the national, provincial or local sphere of government  or
any other functionary or institution exercising  a  power  of  performing  a
function  in  terms  of  the  Constitution,  or  a  provincial  constitution
exercising a  power  or  performing  a  public  function  in  terms  of  any
legislation, but does not include a court or a judicial  officer.  In  other
words, this Bill, if enacted, will give the NIA  the  right  to  investigate
the financial records and personal  information  of  literally  millions  of
South Africans, from a secretary in the Coega municipality to  the  Auditor-
General of the Republic of South Africa.

This Bill does not distinguish between  employees  or  applicants  who  have
access to classified information and those that do not. It does not  require
the NIA to comply with any  process  designed  to  protect  the  privacy  of
individuals.

Parliament is being asked to issue the NIA with a  blank  cheque  that  will
allow it to decide who will be investigated and on what grounds.  We  cannot
in good conscience do so. Members of this Parliament, as representatives  of
the people of South Africa, have a duty to protect the rights and  interests
of the people we serve. That is why we must reject this Bill in its  current
form. At the very  least,  the  Bill  must  be  amended  to  apply  only  to
employees that have access to classified information or who have  access  to
areas  designated   as   national   key   points.   These   are   protective
qualifications the Bill affords persons rendering a service to an  organ  of
state. They should apply equally to employees and job applicants.

I urge members present here  to  oppose  this  Bill  in  its  current  form.
[Applause.]

Mrs  M  E  OLCKERS:  Chairperson,  no  person  should  be  employed  by  the
intelligence services of a country if such person has  not  been  vetted  or
screened, should the DG think it necessary.

Clause 2(a) of the National Strategic Intelligence Bill was included in  the
amendments because South Africa cannot be seen to have such  slack  or  weak
intelligence services that anyone and everyone is welcome regardless. It  is
like having an open house. It is  known  in  the  counterintelligence  world
that one recruits and gets one's best information from unlikely sources  who
usually do not have access to sensitive  information,  such  as  drivers  of
cars with high-ranking  people  as  passengers,  from  visiting  a  bar  and
listening to the friendly conversations in that bar and the clients  or  the
barman himself, or the  cleaners.  People  like  these  need  to  be  vetted
because they often get exposed to casual intelligence conversations.

The DA says that we are giving the NIA sweeping powers to act. Must we  wait
until something like September 11 happens in  South  Africa  and  then  give
more powers, like the  United  States  of  America  had  to  do  with  their
intelligence services after September 11? This is not for everybody.  It  is
only to people involved in state business that this Act will be applied.

If a person applies for a post and fails to get  security  clearance,  there
are mechanisms for appeal set out in this Bill. It is only somebody  who  is
naive and uninformed in the field of counterespionage  operations  who  will
not support this Bill. The New NP, therefore, supports  all  the  Bills  and
especially this one, as previously indicated in this House. [Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, any person who is an employee of the state  or  its
organ is a person who needs to be absolutely beyond doubt. The integrity  of
that person is absolutely important, in particular, in view of the times  in
which we live and in view of what  is  happening  around  us.  When  we  get
briefings from the various  intelligence  agencies,  we  take  note  of  the
various challenges that our young democracy faces. Amongst these  challenges
are the possibilities that we  have  seen  in  recent  weeks.  I  personally
believe that we still have within  our  security  establishment  individuals
who have hidden agendas and who have intentions to destabilise our country.

Therefore, I see no reason why one should have any argument that any  person
who is either employed or seeking employment in any organ  of  state  should
not be vetted for security clearance. If we say  that  we  believe  in  zero
tolerance with respect to terrorism, then I believe this sort  of  provision
is absolutely essential. Thank God, we have seen the loss  of  life  limited
although even one life gone is one too much in what has happened  in  recent
days in our country. Are we going to wait for some  major  tragedy  to  take
place before we decide to close loopholes that we are prepared to  leave  in
the law by tinkering around with little things that will give  persons  with
an ulterior motive the opportunity to get through the net  and  cause  major
damage. We are supportive of not only this amendment but of all  four  Bills
before us. [Time expired.][Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam  Speaker,  the  ACDP  supports  the  National  Strategic
Intelligence Amendment Bill and all the other Bills. We  have  no  objection
to this  Bill  because  we  believe  that  the  screening  of  employees  of
intelligence  services  and  other  sensitive  organs  of  the   state   and
departments in government is vital and that one does need  to  have  such  a
facility. We know as members of Parliament  that  counterintelligence  is  a
reality. We know that nations spy on each other. We also  know  that  people
come to various countries to infiltrate and to get as  much  information  as
possible from that country, and they do that illegally.

So, we live in the real world and, therefore, we need to have real  answers.
Therefore, we want to support this Bill because we do not  believe  it  will
undermine our rights and that it will take  anything  away.  Although  there
are risks, as the Select Committee on Intelligence, we  are  also  there  to
limit those risks. The ACDP supports this Bill. [Applause.]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the Department of Intelligence  has  a  very
important duty  in  regard  to  the  view  of  protection  of  our  country.
Management of this department, therefore, has to be  extremely  co-ordinated
and managed. Global warfare and the rich history of battle  and  colonialism
will certainly inspire the earnest inculcation of  an  efficient  Department
of Intelligence.

The recent attack on the United States could certainly  also  contribute  to
alert a nervous state that attack is possible anytime and that  good  global
relations do not necessarily offer a guarantee to  a  nation's  safety.  The
MF, however, is sure that the department has measures in place to  guarantee
the safety of the South African citizen.

The  amendments  made  to  the  Bill  to  further  accommodate  the   better
management  of  intelligence  are  deemed  necessary  and   in   line   with
constitutional principles to protect our people.

The MF supports the National Strategic Intelligence Amendment Bill  and  all
the others. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR INTELLIGENCE: Madam Speaker, members of the House, we  were
here about ten days ago when we passed  the  four  Bills  that  are  brought
before us today. The Bills were subsequently sent to the NCOP, and the  NCOP
exercised its constitutional right of scrutiny over the Bills,  and  one  of
the items that was brought to our attention, as a concern  of  the  DP,  was
the item of security clearances.

In the original Bill that we passed in this House,  we  had  made  provision
for two categories of people who will be screened for  security  clearances.
The DP pointed out to the ad hoc committee that, in fact,  it  would  be  in
our interest if we linked the  two  categories  to  show  whether  they  are
similar or dissimilar. The matter was discussed in the ad hoc committee  and
it was clarified that the two categories of an employee of the state  and  a
service provider of a state are two different categories. Therefore,  having
agreed that there is a dissimilarity, we put the  clause  ``under/  or''  to
distinguish (a) and (b).

Mr D H M GIBSON: The Minister should have put ``and''.

The MINISTER: I also went to school and learnt  the  same  English  that  he
did.
The Bill was passed by the NCOP and now, again, the DP has come  to  us  and
said, ``Look, we think that your English could be  tinkered  with  a  little
bit. If you put ``and'', it would make so much better for all  of  us''.  It
does not make a big difference. We still explained that the  two  categories
are clear and distinct and the distinction is shown by ``or'' as opposed  to
and.

The further concern that is raised  by  the  DP  is  that  the  intelligence
services are  giving  themselves  unfettered  rights  of  investigation  and
violating the privacy of people who are employed by the state or  organs  of
state. I would like to assure the House that, in fact, in the same  law,  we
have  made  provision  for  regulation  on  how  this  would  be  done.  The
regulations will be made by the Minister and approved by this House  through
the JCI. So we have made provision for all of that to ensure  that  in  fact
the intelligence services have the limits that are required to  ensure  that
we protect the rights of every person who is employed.

Finally, we would like to assure the House that we have put in  this  clause
in the interest of national security. Nothing  more  and  nothing  less.  We
request  the  House  to  approve  this  Bill  because  we  need  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, before I put  the  question  on  the  Bills
before the House under Orders 5 and 6, I want  to  alert  all  of  you  that
there is a technical problem with the printed versions of  the  Intelligence
Services Control Amendment Bill,  Bill  500  of  2002  [B50D-2002]  and  the
Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-
Related Information Bill, Bill 500 of 2001. The  inside  pages  of  the  two
Bills have inadvertently been reversed so that the text of the  one  appears
within the cover of the other. Parties have  been  informed  and  a  limited
number of corrected printed versions have been distributed. Before you  vote
Aye or No or indicate any problems, please  be  clear  which  Bill  you  are
referring to.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Item 5 is  a  composite
thing with four Bills. Two of those Bills, we  are  supporting.  On  one  of
them we wish to divide, and on one of them we wish to record ... how do  you
propose distinguishing them?

The SPEAKER: Order! I propose to deal with each of them separately.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Thank you.

The SPEAKER: Order! I think I must have read your mind, Mr Gibson.

Hon members, we will now come to farewell speeches, which I am told  members
are all dying to make.

                              FAREWELL SPEECHES

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Ladies and  gentlemen,  madam  Speaker
and hon members, the institution of the South African Parliament has come  a
long way in transforming itself and directing that  transformatory  work  to
positively improve the livelihood of our society.

In fact, this is one parliament in the world that has  a  different  make-up
sectorally, racially  and  otherwise,  from  a  university  professor  to  a
domestic worker; from mine manager like Brian Bell to a miner  like  Godfrey
Oliphant, and from a docks and port manager to the donkey man in the  docks.
That is the extent of the representativeness we have in Parliament.

The first impressions of this Parliament one had when we  arrived  in  1994,
observing from the back, unfortunately sitting with Yunus Carrim,  was  that
perhaps this was one area of political life that still  carried  the  legacy
of  the  British  Charles  Dicken's  type  of  Parliament  characterised  by
eloquence,  articulation  and  pride  of  where  one  schooled  and  learned
English. To  an  uneducated  person  like  myself,  it  was  an  institution
characterised by the need to prove the relevance and  correctness  of  one's
existence and presence here.

We have moved beyond the level  of  that  stage  of  development.  An  ever-
remaining challenge for us as Parliament is to really  make  it  a  people's
Parliament. A state is always  characterised  by  the  manner  in  which  it
decides to position itself towards  its  citizens  and  the  extent  of  its
responsiveness. South Africa, as a country, is defined and characterised  as
a developmental state.  This  then  suggests  that  our  oversight  work  as
Parliament has to express itself in recognition of the challenge  to  relate
to the character of a developmental  state.  This  would  have  to  manifest
itself through the degree to which we take  seriously  committee  work,  and
the need to improve levels of capacity  for  committees  to  materially  and
otherwise improve their oversight function.

Overall, there is an ongoing need for Parliament  to  capacitate  individual
MPs to cope with the political and economical challenges that we are  facing
today. The desire to move in  that  direction  would  include  instilling  a
sense of duty in those  of  us  who  are  educated  and  learned  to  impart
knowledge with the sole purpose of empowering our fellow  human  beings.  In
so doing, they would be contributing to building this nation.

During the state of the nation address this year, we were told the story  of
a drought and a farm. In that story, it was illustrated how, during a  heavy
drought, Mr Jacobson, a farm owner, and Joe, who  was  an  employee,  shared
grief in respect of the death of the one and only elephant that was left  on
that farm during that drought.

Let us remind members that  both  Jacobson  and  Joe  grieved  and  lamented
terribly over the loss of the elephant. The extent of their  grief  was  the
same one would not have been able to make a distinction  between  the  owner
and the  employee.  However,  the  reasons  were  quite  different.  For  Mr
Jacobson, on the one hand, this was a serious loss, because he had lost  the
only thing that defined him as a farmer at that point in time. On the  other
hand, for Joe, the issue was who was going to dig  the  hardened  ground  to
bury the huge elephant. [Laughter.]

In this we are trying to show that the challenge for us as a  nation  is  to
commonly identify and characterise our situation correctly for the  interest
of the nation. We would like to congratulate all  those  who,  through  this
Chamber, made attempts to meet this particular challenge. We would  like  to
thank members, all Whips and their respective parties for  particularly  the
positive spirit that prevailed in the execution of our work. We  would  like
to commend the sterling work  and  conduct  of  the  service  officers,  the
police for security provided, the kitchen staff, Table  and  Hansard  staff,
library staff and other units who made our work  as  public  representatives
possible.

We thank them for an excellent display of their  patriotic  duty.  We  thank
Madam Speaker and other presiding officers for  the  manner  in  which  they
conducted the business of the House. We wish members a good festive  season,
a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. May this be a  season  of  hope  and
success for our people. [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to  follow  my  friend  and
colleague, the hon Chief Whip of the Majority Party, and it is  a  privilege
for me to be able to say farewell at the last session of this year. I  think
for many of us it is quite a relief to get to the end of  the  parliamentary
year. Members of Parliament work far  harder  than  members  of  the  public
realise, and I think that we should go  home  and  tell  them  that,  as  we
embark on a month's constituency work before we have a rest.

I have a passionate commitment  to  affirming  and  deepening  democracy  in
South Africa, but our Parliament and  country  are  different  from  others.
There are some people who think that there  should  not  be  an  adversarial
system. In countries where one has a collection of minorities in  government
and where one does not have a government with an enormous majority, then  it
is probably appropriate not to have an adversarial system. In  our  country,
where one does have a  Government  that  has  got  sixty-six  and  one-third
percent what one needs to affirm democracy, in my view, is to  increase  the
size  of  the  opposition  and  decrease  the  size   of   the   government.
[Interjections.] I am very pleased that my own  personal  contribution  this
year has been to persuade thousands of former ANC supporters to look  at  us
with new eyes. [Interjections.]

I would like to do a few things. I would like to thank some  of  my  members
who have only been here for three years. Most of them were  new  politicians
when they came here. I want to thank them for the  contribution  which  they
make in  the  committees  together  with  all  members  of  this  House,  in
improving legislation and for the  contribution  which  they  make  in  this
House as well. I am very proud of the efforts that they make for the  people
of South Africa.

I would like to thank the presiding officers and to say  how  relieved  most
of us were when the rumour that Madam Speaker was about  to  depart  in  the
middle of November ... We are rather relieved because  we  thought  that  we
might have as your successor a real disciplinarian ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! May I interrupt you, hon member. Tomorrow is the  middle
of November. [Laughter.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Well, this might be the ``ides of November''. [Laughter.]

We thought we might get a real disciplinarian like Mr  Farouk  Cassim.  That
would be too ghastly to contemplate. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

We would like to thank the staff at all levels. I  am  not  sure  if  people
know of the contribution which is  made  by  people  like  Kasper  Hahndiek,
Marina Griebenow and Kamal Mansura,  just  to  name  three  of  them.  These
people are worth their weight in gold,  and  we  are  lucky  to  have  them.
[Applause.]

I would like to thank the policemen and women who keep us safe and treat  us
so respectfully and so kindly at every entrance to  Parliament  and  at  all
the gates and everywhere.

I would also like to thank the people who serve us in the dining  rooms  and
those who prepare the food. I am one who really enjoys my food  and  I  like
what is served here in Parliament. I thank them.

Finally, I would also like to thank the Whips of all the  parties  for  what
they do to make this place work, especially  my  own  Whips,  but  also  the
Whips over there. There has been a very good co-operative spirit. My  deputy
does all the work, I get all the glory, and I am grateful to him  especially
for that.

As we now go our way, I would like to wish all the members a  very  fruitful
period of contemplation. There are a whole lot who are going to consider  in
this period whether they are going to cross  the  floor  to  the  Democratic
Alliance next year. [Interjections.] And while they do  that,  I  wish  them
joy and peace. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Dr L N SISULU: On a point of order: We have noted on this side of the  House
that the hon Douglas Gibson has forgotten to thank the barmen. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: I would hesitate to rule on whether that  is  parliamentary  or
unparliamentary! [Laughter.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, we have come to the end of a very  long  and,
in many ways, a very difficult year a year that put strain on  most  of  our
members. Our members have travelled backwards and forwards,  and  often  the
public think this is  fun.  Our  members  do  not  find  it  fun  travelling
backwards and forwards to do their work to ensure that they actually  attend
to the  responsibilities  of  Parliament,  their  constituencies  and  their
political parties. Members of the public seem to think  that  Ministers  and
MPs do not do anything but travel and sit around doing nothing, but that  is
far from the truth. The truth is that most members work extremely hard,  and
they  try  very  hard  to  balance  out  the  schedule   of   work   between
constituencies and Parliament.

Firstly, I would like to thank our MPs, especially  those  dedicated  people
who take their responsibilities seriously, those who are  prepared  to  make
personal  sacrifices  to  meet  their   obligations   and   commitments   to
Parliament, to their constituencies and to their  political  parties.  There
are many such persons in this House today.

We  thank  you,  Madam  Speaker,  and  the  other  presiding  officers   for
maintaining law and order in this House a  daunting  task  at  times  during
this past year. Fortunately, of course, the IFP members do not  give  reason
to have ourselves be told to behave ourselves because we are a pretty  well-
behaved crowd. [Laughter.] But, to all presiding  officers,  we  thank  them
very much for their persistence and their  perseverance.  It  has  certainly
not been a boring year;  it  was  a  somewhat  dramatic  year;  boring  very
seldom.

I would also like to thank all members of the Chief Whips  Forum  for  their
participation and the  co-operation  we  have  had  between  the  opposition
parties and the majority party. I believe we have a  common  goal  in  mind,
and that is to make Parliament function, to make it easier  for  members  to
fulfil their duties. To this end, much has been achieved. There is  still  a
long way to go, but I believe we have made a good start.

To the parliamentary staff here I too would like to  add  my  thanks  to  Mr
Hahndiek, Mr Mansura and Miss Griebenow in particular and to all  the  other
staff for their ongoing co-operation and assistance to us  all,  I  wish  to
say that we appreciate it very sincerely.

To service officers and all other staff, and I include all  staff  catering,
security, etc I thank them for their assistance in making  our  daily  lives
more bearable.

Members of Parliament generally get along. There are times when we  disagree
and it is mainly on political issues, but I want to remind them that  it  is
time we learnt to keep our eye upon doughnut, and not upon the hole.

I take  this  opportunity  to  wish  you,  Madam  Speaker,  all  members  of
Parliament, their families and loved ones a  peaceful,  joyous  and  blessed
Christmas. May the peace and joy of our God and  Saviour  be  with  you  all
today and throughout the year. Enjoy your constituency period,  your  annual
leave, your recess, whatever it is, and  all  come  back  fresh  and  ready.
Remember  to  keep  your  eyes  on  the  doughnut,  and  not  on  the  hole.
[Applause.]

Mr D M BAKKER: Madam Speaker, another year is speedily coming to an end.  At
the end of this session, it is my privilege to  express  our  gratitude  and
wish everyone a good festive season and a pleasant recess.

On behalf of the New NP, I would like to thank you, the Deputy Speaker,  the
Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson  of  Committees  for  your  sometimes
very difficult role in maintaining the dignity of the House.

Dit is nie net gepas nie, maar word ook opreg bedoel, om  die  Hoofsweep  en
Adjunkhoofsweep van die meerderheidsparty, sowel as al die  ander  Swepe  in
hierdie Huis te bedank vir die uiters goeie samewerking in die  forums  waar
ons dien. Die bereidwilligheid om na verdienstelike standpunte  te  luister,
en altyd 'n oopdeurbeleid  te  volg  is  werklik  in  belang  van  ons  jong
demokrasie, en in belang van al die lede van hierdie Huis.

'n Besondere woord ook van dank, soos reeds gemeld, aan die  Sekretaris  van
die Parlement en ander parlementêre personeel vir hulle  ywer  en  toewyding
die afgelope jaar, en namens Douglas ook vir Barney 'n besondere  woord  van
dank. [Gelag.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Not only is it fitting, but also sincere,  to  thank  the  Chief  Whip  and
Deputy Chief Whip of the Majority Party as well as the other Whips  of  this
House, for the extremely good co-operation in the forums in which we  serve.
The  willingness  to  listen  to  meritorious  points  of  view  and  always
following an open-door policy are  really  in  the  interest  of  our  young
democracy and in the interests of all the members of this House.

A special word of gratitude, as mentioned already, also to the Secretary  to
Parliament and other parliamentary staff for their diligence and  commitment
over the last year, and  on  behalf  of  Douglas  also  a  special  word  of
gratitude to Barney. [Laughter.]]
As members, we should always remember that Parliament is not  just  a  party
political game, or just about debates concerning serious  issues.  For  many
people in our country, it is about  survival,  about  justice  and  about  a
better life.  We  deserve  the  upcoming  reprieve  from  our  parliamentary
duties, but members should return even less prepared to  tolerate  the  fact
that so many of our people are  homeless  and  living  on  the  streets.  We
should be even more  committed  to  confronting  poverty,  unemployment  and
crime, and more  committed  to  building  a  South  African  patriotism  and
fostering reconciliation.

It is our responsibility to build a modern civil society based on  a  social
morality, fit and right for today's world. Many of us  will  return  to  our
loved ones and to our homes. We should remember that a  democratic  country,
striving to be a strong country, cannot be morally neutral  about  the  role
of the family. Parents bring up children, not  governments.  In  saying  our
goodbyes today, the New NP wants to  wish  every  member,  and  their  loved
ones, well. We hope that members will enjoy the  time  with  their  families
and their children.

Ons wens u en u geliefdes 'n baie geseënde  en  vreugdevolle  Kersgety  toe,
asook 'n voorspoedige nuwe jaar. God seën u. [Applous.]  [We  wish  you  and
your loved ones a very blessed and joyous Christmas season and a  prosperous
New Year. God bless you all. [Applause.]]

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker, hon members, let it not  be  said  that  this
Parliament does not take its debates seriously. Yesterday,  the  hon  Madasa
of the ACDP asked a  question  to  the  Deputy  President,  requesting  more
speaking time for smaller parties. Since the request  came  from  the  ACDP,
and  after  higher  intervention,  the  Deputy  President,  true  to   form,
listened, and if hon members look at the speakers'  list  for  this  debate,
the ANC have only taken 20% of the time. We are sure that  this  trend  will
continue into the new year and that more time will  indeed  be  allowed  for
smaller parties. [Laughter.]

We can rightly be proud of the wide diversity of views that  are  raised  in
this House. The hon Chief Whip of the Majority Party has raised this  point.
This is truly an assembly representing people from all  religions,  regions,
backgrounds, classes and  cultures.  We  can  justifiably  claim  that  this
institution is fulfilling its mandate as a gathering representing all  South
Africans. Though we often disagree politically, many a  personal  friendship
has developed across party political lines.

These are friendships that must be  nurtured,  because  often  it  is  these
friendships that allow consensus to develop on  controversial  and  disputed
matters. Democracy for us, with our history, must  be  more  than  the  mere
contest of opposing views, but must also  include  the  finding  of  lasting
consensus and solutions.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the presiding  officers,  the
Table staff, the Chamber staff and all other members of  staff  who,  behind
the scenes, ensure the smooth running of this institution. I sincerely  hope
that all of us will return in the new year with a greater sense  of  urgency
and a sharp awareness of what needs to be done to improve the lives  of  all
the people of South Africa.

Our best wishes also go to all Muslims who will be  celebrating  Eid-ul-Fitr
at the end of the month of Ramadaan. We  also  wish  all  South  Africans  a
blessed Christmas.
Lastly, we wish all members of Parliament, officials  and  staff  God  speed
and a safe return to their homes and their dear ones. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker,  the  year  2002  has  been  a  year  of  great
opportunity and challenge for all of us as MPs. Now that  we  have  come  to
the close of the final session of this year, we would have ample time  after
we have had some rest to reflect on our progress for 2002.

We must admit that 2002 has been a  most  challenging  year.  We  have  made
countless speeches and spent hundreds of hours in committee  meetings,  kept
the executive accountable by asking hundreds of questions,  moved  countless
motions, requested sometimes stridently many divisions, passed a  voluminous
amount of legislation and spent many days in our various constituencies.  We
all have worked very hard and when we  come  to  the  end  of  such  a  long
session,  we  feel  the  fatigue  in  many  ways  physically,  mentally  and
sometimes even emotionally.

The Bible is so right when it says: ``To everything there is a season and  a
time to every purpose under the heaven.'' The time has come for  us  to  say
our goodbyes and to wish  each  other  well.  Despite  our  different  world
views, our divergent political views  and  sometimes  very  vibrant,  almost
strident debates, it  is  possible  for  us  to  part  as  friends.  If  our
supporters have learned nothing else from us this year,  let  them  remember
this one lesson: We are one nation with one destiny, called by God  to  lead
by example and to serve the nation with  integrity.  Let  the  nation  learn
from us when they watch Parliament  Live  that  if  we  have  to  fight,  we
contest with words and ideas never with bombs and bullets.  [Interjections.]
We are opponents or contestants, but never enemies.

In conclusion, I wish to thank the presiding officers,  parliamentary  Table
staff, chairpersons of committees and all  parliamentary  staff  for  making
2002 a successful parliamentary year. We  owe  it  to  the  public  and  our
voters to produce our best.

Finally, on behalf of the ACDP, if we do not see each other again,  I  would
like to wish all a Merry Christmas  and  a  prosperous  New  Year.  May  God
protect you and your families over this  festive  season  and  may  everyone
return to Parliament next year, well rested and prepared  to  face  the  new
challenges of a new year. May God bless all. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER:  Mr  Deputy  President,  members  of  the  executive,  fellow
members of Parliament and colleagues, we have come to the end  of  a  rather
exhaustive and long parliamentary year. It  is  time  to  say  farewell  and
goodbye and thank you to everybody. I have to say that it  was  not  only  a
normal, boring political year; it  was  also  a  year  full  of  events  and
happenings.

We had the opportunity  to  see  a  rather  serious  divorce  this  year,  a
political divorce, and I must say that for  us  who  were  not  involved  in
that, we sometimes found it a bit difficult with the pots  and  pans  flying
between the parties involved. [Laughter.] This specific divorce  once  again
proved the fact that there is no such thing as a friendly  divorce.  We  saw
that.

We also had the opportunity to experience a new wedding. We  saw  a  wedding
in this House, and I must say that, about that wedding, the  jury  is  still
out. We all know that the parties are still on their honeymoon and  it  will
take some time to see what is going to happen to this marriage. [Laughter.]

Mevrou die Speaker, ek wil graag namens die VF van die  geleentheid  gebruik
maak om vir u as voorsitter hier baie dankie te sê vir  die  jaar;  ook  aan
die ander voorsittende beamptes vir die harde werk wat u gedoen het.

Aan almal wat betrokke was in die parlementêre opset hier  -  die  personeel
is reeds genoem - en wat 'n bydrae gelewer het, van die mins belangrike  tot
die belangrikste: ek het geluister na die kollegas  en  almal  voor  my  het
spesifiek een komponent uitgesluit.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Madam Speaker, on behalf of the FF I would like to  take  this  opportunity
to extend my thanks to you, as Chairperson, for the year; also to the  other
presiding officers for the hard work you have done.

To everyone involved in the parliamentary set-up here the staff has  already
been mentioned and who have made a contribution, from  the  least  important
to the most important: I have listened to these colleagues and everyone  who
spoke before me excluded one component in particular.]

That component is the press and the media. The press is  one  element  that,
to a certain extent, we as Parliament cannot be without, because there is  a
risk that if the press stops to report  on  what  we  are  doing  here,  the
public out there may just forget about us altogether.

Ek weet ek praat namens die ander partye as ek vir die media baie dankie  sê
vir wat hulle hier vir ons gedoen het. Ek wil van die VF se kant af  vir  'n
ieder en 'n elk sê:  'n  voorspoedige  en  rustige  seëntydperk.  Mag  u  'n
Kersfees deurbring saam met u geliefdes. Mag u  uitgerus  terugkom  volgende
jaar, gereed vir die jaar wat vir ons sal voorlê. Daar is  baie  werk.  Baie
dankie van die VF se kant af vir  elkeen  wat  teenoor  ons  vriendelik  was
hierdie jaar, veral die Swepe en die lede van  die  Parlement.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I know I speak on behalf of the other parties in  thanking  the  media  for
what they have done for us. From the FF I want to say to every  single  one:
A prosperous and peaceful festive season. May you spend Christmas with  your
loved ones. May you return well rested next year, ready for the  year  which
lies ahead. There is a lot of work to be done. From  the  side  of  the  FF,
thank you very much to everyone who were  friendly  towards  us  this  year,
especially the Whips and the Members of Parliament.]

Thank you very much. We will see each other next year. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: I want to thank the hon Mulder  for  drawing  my  attention  to
what has been going on in the House, to things like marriages and  divorces.
I will consider the matter and decide when we come back, whether it  was  in
order or parliamentary. [Laughter.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, we have come to the  end  of  a  challenging
parliamentary year.  We  meet  in  this  Parliament  to  find  solutions  to
problems facing the nation and we shall depart from these  precincts  to  go
to serve our constituencies. On looking back on the year, one  notices  that
there has been changes in some  key  positions  in  Parliament.  We  had  to
contend with three Chief Whips, two Deputy Chief Whips and two  Chairpersons
of Committees.

These  changes  have,  however,  proved  to  be  to  the  benefit   of   the
institution. The incumbents fitted in as if they were  custom-made  for  the
office. Whatever backlogs we  had  in  the  Chief  Whips'  Forum  have  been
disposed of, and meetings of the forum are business-like. The  indefatigable
House Whip has to be thanked for keeping the House and other  Whips  abreast
of developments in the House, regardless of the time at which she picked  up
the change. [Applause.] Never have I experienced  a  House  Whip  with  such
finesse.

We praise the strength of the  Chief  Whip  and  his  deputy  for  the  good
leadership displayed. One hopes that, in  future,  more  speaking  time  for
smaller parties will no longer be an issue. [Laughter.] Thanks  also  go  to
the  Chairperson  of  Committees  and  his  deputy   for   their   incessant
consultation on matters of urgent rescheduling of committees. Their  ability
is also displayed when they preside over business in the House.

We thank members of staff in  the  Chamber,  on  the  premises  and  in  the
security section, in fact, the entire family of Parliament.  Our  hearts  go
out to the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who have  had  to  preside  over  the
debates and show interest throughout, even when debates were dull. We  shall
pause for a while from calls of ``Order'' and ``Hon  member,  your  speaking
time is expired''. [Laughter.]

Merry Christmas to one and all. May the good Lord bless you. [Applause.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, I always look forward to this debate  once  a
year when I get the clapping of hands from the ANC's side too.

I am sure we are all too tired, too tired even to continue fighting  and  it
is the time of the year when we can go  home  and  bond  with  our  families
again and bond with our homes. I do not know what is going on  in  my  home,
and I always look forward to this time of the year.

We must never forget that we have made a pledge  to  this  nation.  When  we
signed the final Constitution in this House  on  8  July  1996,  we  made  a
commitment that we would never take this  country  back  to  where  we  came
from. Therefore, in that  Constitution,  we  set  very  high  standards  for
ourselves. So when we debate in this Chamber and we criticise  and  we  look
at things that are not right, it is not because we do not  like  the  ruling
party. It is not because the ruling party is a black ruling  party,  but  it
is because we want to observe and  respect  the  Constitution  that  is  the
highest law in the country. I would like to see that  we  approach  the  new
year with that kind of spirit, that we respect one another for our views.

I want to thank the presiding officers and the Chief Whips for  running  and
managing Parliament the way we did this year, and also the  staff  and  wish
everyone a happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year, including some of  the
ultra-leftists like the hon Jeremy Cronin. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, another year has been completed  in  endless
debate, hard work, commitment and service  delivery.  Each  one  of  us  has
played a part and deserves a pat on the back for the sacrifice endured  over
this term. However, we all have sworn to do our duty, which we will  deliver
on happily.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all  those  who  have  worked
tiresome hours to make our duties lighter. May God bless you for  your  hard
work and dedication to the South African way.

To the hon members, it has been a challenging year  and  it  was  work  well
done. I hope that the constituency period will enable  you  to  return  next
year with greater challenges and better delivery for our people. To the  hon
Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Chief Whip, Deputy  Chief  Whip,  the  Chairperson,
Deputy  Chairperson,  presiding  officers,  chairs  of  committees  and  the
committees, I sincerely thank you all for time spent in  making  our  system
more efficient and effective.

To our support staff and those in our office,  I  thank  you  all  for  your
assistance that has made delivery possible. To all those who have  played  a
part in this governmental process, I thank you for  your  contribution.  May
God bless you all. Spend the holidays safely with  your  family  and  return
safely to a fresh year with new challenges.

I also take this opportunity to wish the President and Deputy President  and
our Ministers a happy, happy holiday. Finally, on  behalf  of  the  MF,  Eid
Mubarak to all our Muslim communities. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam  Speaker,  colleagues,  as  you  probably  know,  at  the
moment, I am a bit under seige from the right-wing of my party and,  as  the
AEB has its congress on 8 February, there is a possibility that  this  might
not be a ``goodbye'' speech, but a ``farewell'' speech.

Maybe my chances are not so bad, because luckily,  the  real  right-wing  of
the AEB is now quite at home in the DP. [Laughter.] [Applause.]  Of  course,
there is another possibility. If  you  could  play  your  charm  with  Judge
Arthur Chaskalson, it can be a case of ``een,  twee,  drie,  blok  myself''.
But I must say I would rather win my case at our congress than be  known  in
future as a ``crosstitute''. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

But do not worry. As they say  in  Afrikaans,  ``die  kat  kom  weer''.  And
please, Madam Speaker, that has nothing to do with  a  certain  noise  ruled
out of order in this House. [Laughter.] [Applause.] Well, let us hope  yours
truly will be here home and dry when President Mbeki delivers his  state  of
two nations address next year.

On behalf of the AEB, I want to thank everyone who made  a  contribution  to
the functioning of Parliament during the past year. I  know  that  sometimes
things get a bit hot inside this House ...
... maar op die ou einde van die dag, soos Naas  sê,  ``Parliament  is  like
the song of Leon Schuster, Die Rugby-onthaal, as hy sing:`Op die  veld  waai
die velle; hier's  ons  almal  goeie  pelle;  vat  'n  sjerrie  vir  jou  ou
klakous.'' [... but at the end of the day, as  Naas  says,  ``Parliament  is
like the song of Leon Schuster, Die Rugby-onthaal, where he sings:  `Op  die
veld waai die velle; hier's ons almal goeie pelle; vat 'n  sjerrie  vir  jou
ou klakous.''']

To you, Madam Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and your co-chairs,  I  thank  you
for the dignified way in which you directed proceedings in this House.

Aan die personeel, van wie ek almal net die beste  diens  ontvang  het,  van
Marina Griebenow se gereelde e-posse tot die ontvangs by die ingange in  die
Parlement. [To the staff, from all of whom I have  received  only  the  best
service, from Marina Griebenow's regular e-mails to  the  reception  at  the
entrance to Parliament.]

Thank you to all the Chief Whips, the Deputy  Chief  Whip,  House  Whip  and
party Whips for their good work. Congratulations go to the  two  new  Deputy
Ministers. I must say I am a bit worried about Mr Renier Schoeman as  Deputy
Minister of Health. It does not look to me as if  he  knows  so  much  about
sex. [Laughter.]

I want to conclude. If we really want peace and harmony  in  Parliament  and
in the country, I suggest and I propose that during the festive  season  the
following couples spend two weeks alone on an island: the hon Tony Leon  and
Marthinus van Schalkwyk, President Mbeki and the hon Jeremy Cronin, the  hon
Kalyan and the hon Dennis Bloem, the Minister of Sport and  the  ref-tackler
Pieter van Zyl from Potchefstroom, hon Salam Abram and George Bush, and,  of
course, myself and Cindy Crawford. [Applause.]

Madam Speaker, hon members, a peaceful and enriching festive season  to  you
all, and lots of runs for Jacques Kallis and, of  course,  lots  of  wickets
for Makhaya Ntini. [Applause.]

The  SPEAKER:  Hon  members,  I  am  sure  I  speak  for  all  of  us  that,
notwithstanding anything the President of the Constitutional Court may  say,
we would welcome the hon member Aucamp back, regardless  of  which  seat  he
occupies in this House. [Laughter.]

We have, as all of you have indicated, come to the  end  of  a  particularly
gruelling year and a particularly difficult last few weeks, but there  is  a
bright side. With two exceptions, we have actually completed and I  am  sure
the  Leader  of  Government  Business  would  be  glad  to  know  that   the
legislative agenda that we received. And, generally, we did so on the  basis
of more than sufficient consensus.

We have to thank the hard work of all members of this House for that.  I  do
not think we can say it was one particular group more than the  other.  This
applies to the work in the House as well as in the committees, led by  their
chairs. We have also, to my particular pleasure, actually had  a  number  of
important debates where we have tried to discuss major  issues  that  affect
the country, and international  issues,  and  made  a  contribution  to  the
building of the African Union. With regard to that task, a lot of  it  still
has to be done.

As   Parliament   and   members   of   Parliament,   we   have   contributed
internationally and I sometimes think we do  not  realise  how  much  we  do
contribute on the  international  level  to  the  development  of  ideas  of
democracy  and  to  the  development  of  the  concepts  of  Parliament.  We
ourselves sometimes  are  too  critical  and  do  not  notice  what  we  are
achieving. So I want to say to all of those who have taken part in  those  a
particular thanks, because we have made  contributions.  We  have  not  just
gone on pleasure trips, although it has also been enjoyable.

To the Table staff, led by Mr Hahndiek, I  want  to  thank  them  for  their
particular advice, their support  and  their  management  of  the  Assembly.
There are also a large number of Table staff who we  do  not  often  see  in
front of us. For their work also I want to express, on all your behalf,  our
appreciation.

To the service officers in the Chamber, and within Parliament  because  they
move around often almost unnoticed until they are  not  there,  and  then  I
keep getting complaints that they are not there we do  appreciate  the  work
they do there and their presence. Thank you to all parliamentary  staff  who
organise services, various ones that bring the Bills before us  to  give  us
that accumulation of paper that fills  our  pigeonholes  all  the  time.  It
takes work to do that. It  is  difficult  for  us  to  assimilate  all  that
information, but unfortunately, it is necessary. So  we  do  appreciate  the
work that goes into that.
I will not forget the bar staff or the catering staff,  and  want  to  thank
them all on our behalf. They also have performed  well  have  the  cleaners,
and many other who have generally notwithstanding the problems that we  have
made our capacity to work that much easier.

I want to thank those who  have  kept  the  sound  system  in  the  National
Assembly going, regardless of the  break-downs  and  all  the  difficulties,
because they came in  at  the  last  minute  and  allowed  us  to  continue.
[Applause.]

Now in case some of you  are  feeling  ignored,  I  have  deliberately  left
towards the end the Chief Whips  and  that  slightly  mysterious  collective
called the Whippery, because without your co-operation, with each other  and
with the presiding officers, I think the business of Parliament  would  have
ground to a halt. So, I want to thank you for your efforts.

To the parliamentary counsellors to the President and the Deputy  President,
you have liaised well. We believe you have kept the executive  members  with
whom you liaise well informed of what goes on here. The Deputy  President  I
want to thank especially  in  his  capacity  as  the  Leader  of  Government
Business, and for being with us as often as you have been and for  answering
questions. [Applause.] But I do not, Deputy President, wish to give you  too
much encouragement. We have appreciated your humour, but singing is  out  of
order in the House. [Laughter.] We thank you  for  improving,  considerably,
the communication between the executive and the National Assembly.

To Mr Doidge and Mr Cassim, thank you for your assistance in the  presiding,
but also for the efforts you are now initiating and making in  the  managing
of committees and supporting their work  and  facilitating  their  activity.
That again is something that lies ahead of you.

Last, but not least, to  the  Deputy  Speaker,  ever-supportive,  ever-there
when you need her and also providing a smoothing of problems that  arise  in
the House. I have watched often on the monitor and admired how  she  somehow
seems to glide over the problems. I hope to learn better from  her  example.
[Applause.]

I want to encourage all members during this recess to visit  the  exhibition
on perceptions of Africa that opened. It will be on  until  you  come  back,
but do not leave it too late. We hope you will encourage  schools,  friends,
whatever group you work with, to come and see it because it is  a  lot  more
than a display of maps and it is a challenge to  all  of  us  to  understand
perspective when we talk to each other, and to respect  the  perspective  of
others. That is really what it is. It is  to  acknowledge  the  validity  of
each other's points of view and thereby contribute to the  better  political
debate and to the better atmosphere in this particular House. I hope we  all
draw appropriate lessons from that particular experience.

I want to wish you enjoyment with your families on your well-deserved  break
and request you to enjoy all the festivities because it may be  a  Christian
or another festivity and, I assure you, you can enjoy them all and there  is
no prohibition on participating and celebrating, and have a  very  good  new
year. Come back refreshed, hon members. As you yourselves have  said,  there
is much that still needs to be done. But remember always  that  tomorrow  is
always better and next year will be better  for  the  South  African  people
because of our efforts. [Applause.]

The House adjourned at 17:48.

National Assembly:

Papers:

1.    The Minister for Provincial and Local Government:


     Letter from the Minister for Provincial and Local Government, tabled in
     terms of section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance  Management  Act,  1999
     (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining the reasons for the late tabling of  the
     following annual reports:


     1.      Annual  Report  of  the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
         Government:
         The annual  report  of  the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
         Government was tabled on 15 October 2002. The report was  completed
         by the Department and handed over to  the  contractors  for  layout
         and printing on 4 September 2002. The printing  was  completed  and
         the report delivered to the Government  Printers  on  23  September
         2002.  The  report  was  therefore  completed  and  available   for
         tabling. Unfortunately, due to a purely administrative  fault,  the
         report was only formally tabled  on  15  October  2002.  The  Chief
         Financial Officer, Mr C A Clerihew takes  responsibility  for  this
         lack of communication.


     2.     Municipal Infrastructure Investment Unit:


         The annual report of the Municipal Infrastructure  Investment  Unit
         (MIIU) was prepared within 3 months of the end of  its  current  28
         February 2002 financial year. It was formally handed over on 8  May
         2002. This was the  first  annual  report  prepared  following  the
         listing of the MIIU as a public  entity  in  terms  of  the  Public
         Finance Management Act, 1999. The  MIIU  also  provided  the  final
         draft report to the Portfolio Committee on Local Government at  the
         annual budget hearings. The annual report was not, however,  tabled
         in Parliament and this is  being  addressed.  The  Chief  Financial
         Officer, Mr C A Clerihew, takes  responsibility  for  not  ensuring
         that the necessary actions were taken timeously.


         I would like to state  that  these  delays  were  not  due  to  the
         inability  to  prepare  the  reports,  but  rather   administrative
         processes. The assurance is given that additional control  measures
         have been introduced to  ensure  that  this  unfortunate  occurence
         does not happen again.


     3.     Municipal Demarcation Board:


         In respect of  the  annual  report  of  the  Municipal  Demarcation
         Board, the  reasons  for  non-compliance  were  obtained  from  the
         Manager of the Board, Mr H R Monare.


     3.1    The Audit was carried out and completed on time, and the Auditor-
         General duly signed off the Financial Statements on 19  July  2002,
         as he found the Board fully prepared for the audit.


     3.2    The preparation of the text for the Annual  Report  was  started
         early in the year, and  was  actually  complete  by  the  time  the
         Auditor-General signed off the Financial Statements.


     3.3    However,  there  were  serious  inefficiencies  in  the  design,
         selection and securing of photographs, proof reading  and  ultimate
         pulling together and printing of the report itself.


     3.4    The main reasons for the inefficiencies in this  regard  are  as
         follows:


         -  In an environment such as the Board's, where  on  the  one  hand
              staff numbers are  minimal,  and  on  the  other,  duties  are
              numerous  and  diverse,  logistical   co-ordination   in   the
              administration  and  the  way  information  moves   from   one
              cluster/department to another, needs  to  work  perfectly,  in
              order to make the most of the available human resources.


         -  In the above regard, the Manager of  the  Municipal  Demarcation
              Board has put in place processes to regularise internal  tasks
              such  as  the  compilation  of  an  annual  report.  But  this
              regularisation of tasks has not yet been fully perfected,  and
              co-ordination to ensure that all  tasks  get  carried  out  by
              minimal staff at the same time sometimes fails, and timeframes
              are compromised, as has happened in this case.


     3.5    The Manager  of  the  Municipal  Demarcation  Board  takes  full
         responsibility for failure to comply with the law  in  this  regard
         and undertakes to ensure that this never happens again in future.




     F S MUFAMADI
     MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

2.    The Minister of Public Enterprises:


     Letter from the Minister of Public  Enterprises,  tabled  in  terms  of
     section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act  No  1
     of 1999), explaining the reasons for the late  tabling  of  the  annual
     reports for Aventura and Alexkor:
         However,  due  to  the  verification  of  Assets  and   Liabilities
         (particularly contingent  liabilities),  the  finalisation  of  the
         Report has been delayed. The  verification  process  has  now  been
         completed.


         The Annual Report for Alexkor will  be  available  for  tabling  in
         Parliament not later than 31 December 2002.
