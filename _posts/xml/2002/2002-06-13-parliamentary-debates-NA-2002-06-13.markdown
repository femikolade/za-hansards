                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr E S MAGASHULE: Chairperson, I will move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the uncouth behaviour of the hon Tony Leon in this House during
       the President's question time  when  he  talks  and  heckles  as  the
       President is answering questions, and that the  hon  Leon  this  week
       delivered an undignified and unbecoming public  attack  on  President
       Thabo Mbeki;


  (2) further notes that the  hon  Leon  mouths  platitudes  about  a  less
       antagonistic approach to politics  but  cannot  resist  sinking  into
       rabble-rousing rather than debating issues of policy;


  (3) believes that such attempts to divert attention from the problems  of
       paucity of policy, internal discipline  and  ethical  behaviour  that
       have resulted in the collapse of  his  own  party  do  the  political
       landscape grave harm; and


  (4) calls on the hon Leon rather to retire gracefully from the  political
       arena and leave the field to those who  want  to  build  rather  than
       destroy our national unity.

[Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mr N S BRUCE: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the SABC, and especially its television  service,  is  now
       even more of an instrument of government propaganda than it was under
       the apartheid government;


  (2) expresses its distress that the SABC deliberately distorts the  truth
       through  selective  coverage,   deliberate   bias   and   incompetent
       reporting; and


  (3) recognises that this is, at the  expense  of  democratic  values,  in
       violation of its charter as a public broadcaster and  reduces  it  to
       the status of a publicly financed liar.

[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chair, I hereby give notice that at  the  next  sitting  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) commends the police in the Eastern Cape for arresting  a  businessman
       for stealing 104 cycads to the value of R800 000;


  (2) is aggrieved by the fact that this businessman planted the cycads  in
       the premises of his business without any valid permit for  possessing
       the endangered species; and


  (3) hopes that his arrest will lead to effective prosecution to serve  as
       a deterrent to other  thieves  who  harvest  endangered  species  and
       thereby deprive our landscape of the beauty of these species.

Ms H F MALEBANA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that South Africa was elected by an  overwhelming  majority  to
       the seat of the International Labour  Organisation's  governing  body
       (the ILO) for the period 2002-2005;


  (2) believes that this  election  represents  an  opportunity  for  South
       Africa to influence the global  employment  agenda  and  decent  work
       agenda and to promote the goals of Nepad in the ILO; and


  (3) congratulates the Minister of Labour for this  election  victory  and
       the South African Government for the leading role it  is  playing  in
       international bodies in order to place the interests of  Africa  high
       on the international agenda.

Mnr J DURAND: Geagte voorsitter, hiermee stel ek voor namens die Nuwe NP:


  Dat die Huis -
   (1)      kennis neem dat -


        (a)      diensverbruikers  in  Gauteng  meer  as  R12  miljard  aan
              plaaslike owerhede verskuldig is, en dat dit sommige rade  se
              vermoë om dienste te lewer ernstig aan bande lê;


        (b)      enige plaaslike raad wat stappe doen om skuld in te vorder
              en  billike  reëlings  tref  om  gratis  dienste   te   lewer
              aangemoedig word; en


        (c)       daar  vandag  'n  protes  teen   kredietbeheeraksies   in
              Slovoville binne die  Johannesburgse  Metropolitaanse  gebied
              gelei word;


   (2)      die leier van die Opposisie ernstig betig omdat 'n  lid  van  sy
        Gautengse streekraad, mnr Moses Mathunjwa, die protesaksie inisieer
        en lei; en


   (3)      'n beroep doen op die agb Leon en die DA om hulle  ondersteuners
        in Houghton - veral diegene wat gereeld vir  dienste  betaal  -  te
        laat weet dat die DA  kredietbeheeraksies  van  die  Johannesburgse
        Metroraad ondermyn.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows.)

[Mr R J DURAND: I hereby give notice that I shall move on behalf of the  New
NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  service consumers in  Gauteng  owe  the  local  authorities  R12
           billion, and that this seriously hampers the ability of councils
           to deliver services;


       (b)  any local council that takes steps  to  collect  debt  and  make
           reasonable arrangements to  provide  basic  services  should  be
           encouraged; and


       (c)  today a protest against credit control action will take place in
           Slovoville in the Johannesburg Metropolitan area;


  (2) earnestly reprimands the leader of the Opposition because a member of
       his Gauteng regional council, Mr Moses Mathunjwa, has  initiated  and
       is leading the protest action; and


  (3) calls upon the hon Leon and the DA to inform supporters in Houghton -
       especially those who  regularly  pay  for  services  -  that  the  DA
       undermines the credit control action of the Johannesburg Metropolitan
       Council.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Chairperson, I will move on behalf of the  UDM  at  the
next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the Constitutional Court ruling regarding  the  powers  of  the
       Asset Forfeiture Unit;


  (2) agrees that organised  crime  is  casting  a  huge  shadow  over  our
       country, leading to massive social costs and exploitation and equally
       damaging effects to the economy;


  (3) congratulates Sars and the SAPS for yesterday's arrest of  35  people
       and the seizure of R60 million in  assets  relating  to  the  illegal
       manufacturing of cigarettes;


  (4) acknowledges that, despite  these  successes,  interdepartmental  co-
       operation against organised crime has still not been fully  achieved,
       and  that  often  the  competition  and  distrust   among   different
       departments prevent proper and timely co-operation; and


  (5) calls on Government to strengthen these types  of  integrated  crime-
       fighting efforts that combine the skills and legal  mechanisms  of  a
       variety of branches of Government, in  order  to  ensure  that  South
       Africa becomes uninhabitable for organised criminals.

Mr K M MOEKETSE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Mr Gerald Morkel, the same Mayor of the Cape Town Unicity,
       reportedly declined to read a speech prepared for him by  his  party,
       which contained a pledge that he would resign if found guilty of  any
       wrongdoing;


  (2) believes that this refusal to make such a commitment is  yet  another
       indication of Mr Morkel's complicity in the dubious activities of the
       international fugitive, Mr Jürgen Harksen; and


  (3) calls on the DA leadership to put some lead in its pencil and to sign
       Mr Morkel's dismissal papers.
[Applause.]

Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson, I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with appreciation that -


       (a)  Mr  Richard  Ngojo  from  Dobsonville  in  Soweto  started  rock
           painting in 1987 and sold some of his artwork at street corners;


       (b)  as it was illegal to sell stuff in town at  that  time,  he  was
           frequently arrested;


       (c)  he was unemployed the last 14 years; and


       (d)  today we are talking of a self-taught  artist  who  teaches  our
           youth; and


  (2) commends him for motivating youngsters and developing his artwork and
       promoting learning through play.
[Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, I shall move at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) remembers the Soweto uprising of 16 June 1976;


  (2) observes that this uprising is unique in the history of the world  in
       that it involved schoolchildren and the youth of our country;


  (3) that this history is written with blood, which no lies  written  with
       ink can erase;


  (4) salutes the leadership of the Black Consciousness Movement of  Azania
       (BCM) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)  and  remembers
       particularly Steve Biko and others like Onkgopotse Abraham  Tiro  for
       their critical and historic leadership;


  (5) further observes that the PAC is the only political  organisation  in
       South Africa whose leaders were imprisoned for the Soweto uprising as
       evidenced in the secret Bethal Trial of 18 in which  the  judge  said
       ...


  `You, Mothopeng, acted to saw ...'

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your one minute  is
up. The rest of your motion will be printed ...

Dr S E M PHEKO: Thank you very much, Chairperson and I do not care  for  the
howlers here. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Proceed, hon member.

Mr F BHENGU: Chair, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a 12-member independent panel of eminent personalities appointed
           by the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, reported
           that Africa has made impressive strides towards  democratisation
           in recent years;


       (b)  this  report  alluded  to  a  sharp  drop  in  development  aid,
           unfavourable access to markets for  African  exports,  conflicts
           and poor governance, and that these factors  hindered  progress;
           and


       (c)  most importantly, the report calls  on  the  United  Nations  to
           throw its weight behind Africa's new homegrown strategy, the New
           Partnership for Africa's Development; and


  (2) welcomes the recommendations of this report as it will  usher  a  new
       era in the history of humankind where Africa will take  its  rightful
       position as  an  equal  player  in  the  world  global  economic  and
       political system.

[Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Chair, I give notice that I shall move:


  That this House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the report by the Auditor-General that the ANC left the City  of
           Cape Town in a financial shambles when  it  lost  power  to  the
           Democratic Alliance in 2000, with mismanagement and book-keeping
           errors leaving millions of rands unaccounted for; and


       (b)  that Saleem Mowzer, the main critic of the DA's new budget,  was
           chairman of Exco and therefore in charge of the city  government
           when this financial chaos occurred; and


  (2) expresses its gratitude  to  the  DA  for  rescuing  Cape  Town  from
       financial ruin and  turning  it  into  a  city  where  investors  and
       tourists are helping to create jobs.

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Chair, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) is shocked to learn that a 19-year old boy  from  Missouri  Secondary
       School in  Eldorado  Park  was  allegedly  shot  and  killed  by  his
       classmate on Tuesday;


  (2) is further shocked that the suspect fled from school with an  unknown
       man;


  (3) notes that the deputy principal of the  school  blamed  the  shooting
       incident on the Minister of Education for  the  ban  on  random  drug
       testing in schools;


  (4) believes that drug testing is not the  only  solution  but  that  the
       Departments of Education  and  of  Safety  and  Security  and  school
       governing  bodies  should  put  other  plans  in  place  urgently  to
       guarantee the safety of all learners and teachers.

Ms M P COETZEE-KASPER: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) recalls the attempts of the DA, that sad  offspring  of  the  DP,  to
       promote itself as a clean and efficient alternative government;


  (2) recognises that the DA has  been  racked  with  scandal,  dissension,
       divorce and decline;


  (3) notes with alarm that yet  another  office  bearer  of  the  DA,  the
       provincial  chair,  Mr  Theuns  Botha,  is  under  investigation  for
       conflict of interests; and


  (4) calls on the  DA  to  explain  how  it  can  position  itself  as  an
       alternative government when it cannot even govern its own members and
       manage its internal affairs with honesty and transparency.

[Applause.]

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the shocking  allegation  made  on  the  floor  of  this  House
       yesterday by the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development,
       Penuell Maduna, that leading DA politicians  are  being  investigated
       for money laundering;


  (2) notes with concern that the issue around the funds allegedly received
       from German tax fugitive, Jürgen Harksen, by leading figures  in  the
       DA is not so much the source of the funds, but how  they  were  dealt
       with once received; and


  (3) calls on the Scorpions to finalise their investigation  expeditiously
       so that the good name of  governance  in  the  Western  Cape  can  be
       restored.

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, I will move on behalf of the UDM  at  the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that  sexual  abuse  of  South  African  children  is  reaching
       epidemic proportions, especially since even one such incident is  one
       too many;


  (2) therefore condemns the latest report that a teacher accused of having
       sexual  relations  with  20  pupils  cannot  be  disciplined  by  the
       Department of  Education  since  intimidation  is  so  high  that  no
       witnesses are willing to testify; and


  (3) calls on all teachers and teacher organisations to join  hands  in  a
       concerted campaign to rid the profession of  those  who  abuse  their
       position to hurt our children, recognising that it is  only  once  we
       break the silence and speak up that our children will be safe.

Ms I MUTSILA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that South Africa's status as a hot  holiday  spot  has
       been confirmed with figures pointing to an 18% rise in the number  of
       visitors from Europe;


  (2) further notes that there was also an  upswing  in  traveller  numbers
       from Asia as well as strong interest from the United States in  South
       Africa;


  (3) believes that the increasing number of tourists to the  country  will
       contribute positively to economic growth and development;


  (4) welcomes the increase in the number of tourists; and


  (5)  calls  on  all  stakeholders  in  this  sector   to   work   towards
       consolidating this upward trend of tourists coming to our country.

[Applause.]

     PARTNERSHIP AWARD FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN METROPOLITAN AREAS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr  C  H  F  GREYLING:  Voorsitter,  ek  stel   sonder   kennisgewing   voor
[Chairperson, I move without notice:]


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Municipality of Emthanjeni (De Aar) is one of  the  14
       winners worldwide of the Stockholm partnership  awards  for  original
       solutions to sustainable development in metropolitan areas;


  (2) congratulates the municipality on this excellent achievement; and


  (3) believes  that  their  original  and  cost-effective  plans  for  the
       management of water, sanitation and waste will be an example to other
       municipalities.

Agreed to.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 24 - Safety and Security, and Vote  No  22  -  Independent
Complaints Directorate:

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, hon members. I  hope  that
the many empty seats today do not mean that the members have run  away  from
the police present here today. They have come, not to harass  any  MPs,  but
to affirm their commitment to the democratic dispensation in  place  in  our
country at this time. [Applause.]

There are people and organisations whose names I  want  to  raise  today  in
appreciation of the contribution they have made and continue to make in  our
fight against crime. One of my points of  reference  as  I  do  this  is  my
predecessor, the hon Steve Tshwete, to whose memory  I  am  dedicating  this
input.

There was a view by a small minority of our people before the 1994  election
that South Africa was going to  slide  into  lawlessness,  on  the  back  of
serious polarisation between the black and white citizens of the  land.  The
political turmoil before the election, with  bomb  explosions  and  killings
happening in some parts of our country, created  an  uncertainty  about  the
future,  particularly  on  the  part  of  some  members  of   our   minority
communities.

Given that some of killings were racist,  there  was  a  genuine  fear  that
South Africa was on the verge of a racial  war.  To  compound  the  problem,
indications were that some members of the police force  and  other  security
structures of the time were  implicated  in  the  violence.  The  democratic
Government had to reassure South Africans  from  all  walks  of  life  about
their safety and security. Violence of all  types  had  to  be  stopped  and
measures put in place to deal with crime.

The ability of Minister Sydney  Mufamadi  to  transform  and  modernise  the
Police Service to meet the demands of  our  democratic  dispensation  was  a
tremendous effort that  deserves  our  praise.  That  also  applies  to  the
successful amalgamation of the former 11  police  forces  into  the  present
integrated Service. The National Crime Prevention Strategy, our lodestar  in
the fight against crime, took root under his tutelage. The hon the  Minister
did well.

The new mood and positive attitude  permeating  the  ranks  of  the  service
during Minister Tshwete's time had a lot to do with personnel  changes  that
were informed by the country's demographics. An assessment since 1995  shows
the following patterns. At the level of senior management in 1995, 75%  were
white. In 1999 there was a slight change and 73% were white,  but  where  we
stand now, blacks are in the majority with  53%.  At  the  level  of  middle
management in 1995, white representation  was  89%  and  in  1999  that  had
changed somewhat to 71%. But at this point it is 56% with blacks at 44%.  At
the junior level though, 66% were black in 1995 and 70% in  1999  -  and  at
this point 73% of that level are black.

Mr M J ELLIS: How many crooks have they caught?

The MINISTER: Gender representation, which  we  have  not  included  in  the
equation, was grossly lopsided. I am going to request Cabinet quite soon  to
allow me to appoint  new  deputy  national  commissioners  as  part  of  our
transformation exercise. One of the new appointees  will  be  a  woman  -  a
black woman. [Applause.]

The police will remember Comrade Tshwete for the consistent manner in  which
he raised the morale of the members of the SAPS. He will be  remembered  for
his dedicated attention to the unity of all the police,  accompanied  by  an
insistence on discipline within the ranks.

We want to pay homage also to the great  majority  of  our  people  who  are
contributing time and energy in the fight  against  crime  in  our  country.
They range from businesspeople to reservists  and  volunteers  who  answered
the President's call to lend a hand to build  a  better  life  for  all  our
people.

More than 78 000 volunteers are helping the police in both crime  prevention
and administration. Barely six years ago approximately 900 community  police
forums were formed. To date there are 1 200 forums and  subforums  in  which
more than 10 000 community members serve.

Business against Crime has been involved for a  long  time  with  the  SAPS.
Some  of  the  improvements  to  our  police  stations,  both  service   and
infrastructure, are a direct result of the  involvement  of  this  NGO.  The
peace and development project that was launched  in  Soshanguve  in  Gauteng
and Khayelitsha here in the Western Cape and the  Jong  Dames  Dinamiek  are
some of the projects businesspeople are contributing to.

A Cape Flats-based group of concerned citizens  established  on  7  February
2002 an NGO  called  Ukukanya  Kwemini,  which  has  embarked  on  a  social
experiment involving  former  prisoners  and  their  families.  The  NGO  is
running an awareness programme among students and  the  youth  on  substance
abuse and gangsterism. Some Cape  Town  community  leaders  have  associated
themselves with the project. The former  prisoners  are  recruiting  others,
including those who are due for release from Pollsmoor Prison.

The Banking Council of SA also works with the police in  the  fight  against
crime to improve the quality of life of our people.  There  are  others,  of
course, whose names I will not mention and who are involved in several  ways
as partners in the fight against crime.

All of this defines the move by our people away from  our  painful  past  to
times of peace and prosperity. The shift  to  a  new  mindset  is  palpable.
Levels of confidence in the SAPS have risen measurably. We note  the  report
on the survey done by the Institute for Security Studies which puts  at  52%
the number of people who trust the police and  willingly  report  crime.  We
also note that 67% of people willingly give evidence in court as witnesses.

In a previous survey done by the ISS  the  following  observation  was  made
regarding perceptions of the police:


  The difference between the negative general public  perceptions  and  the
  positive perceptions of people who had direct contact with the police, is
  indicative of the extent to  which  external  factors,  about  which  the
  police can do little, can influence attitudes.


  The study made the following point: This positive response was attributed
  to the professional, supportive and prompt service they received from the
  police.

I also wish to record my appreciation to the  hon  members  of  this  House,
from both sides, for their commitment to the  search  for  answers  to  this
country's crime problems. The impression I get is that we  are  increasingly
defining crime outside of the hurly-burly of political contestation. I  hope
I am correct in my assessment that this is one area  of  our  obligation  to
serve our people where both sides of the House want to reach  out  and  face
criminals as a united force. This, indeed, is how  we  need  to  respond  to
crime.

I would like to contribute to the consolidation of  that  new  approach.  To
that extent I am open to both suggestions and constructive criticism.  There
are some South Africans, I am sorry to  report,  though,  whose  disposition
continues to be cynical towards our effort  to  consolidate  our  democracy.
Just the  other  day  one  of  our  major  national  newspapers  carried  an
editorial that said, among other things, that the police were  losing  their
fight  against  criminals.  The  propensity  of  some  political  and  other
commentators in South Africa to make flippant  observations  about  many  of
the serious challenges we face as we build our new democracy troubles me.  I
am convinced, though, that our nation's psyche is strong  enough  to  resist
the attempt to cast us into a mode of debilitation and defeatism.

Many of the members of the Police Service  make  arrests  in  situations  of
confrontation, where their colleagues sustain permanent  injury  or  die  at
the hands of gun-wielding criminals. They are prepared  to  lay  down  their
own lives to create the safe and secure environment  we  need  in  order  to
improve the quality of our lives.

It is perhaps appropriate at  this  stage  to  report  that  last  year  163
members of the Service were killed. This is much lower  than  has  been  the
case since 1994.

Discussions are advanced between us and the relevant authority to  establish
a system of additional death benefits for members of the Police Service.  We
will come back to the House for further announcements on the matter.

It is not my intention when I  raise  matters  in  this  fashion  to  stifle
criticism of the Police  Service.  In  fact,  police  weaknesses  should  be
exposed. Quite clearly, not everything in the Service is hunky-dory. Let  me
admit that there are some members of the force  who  stray  and  betray  our
people. Some members even render themselves guilty of dereliction  of  duty.
Last week we arrested 17 members and  we  are  going  to  charge  them  with
corruption.

While figures compiled by the Independent Complaints Directorate indicate  a
4,2% decrease regarding serious criminal offences committed  by  members  of
the Police Service, incidents of  misconduct  reported  increased  by  29,3%
compared to the same period in the last financial year.

My attitude to these latest and other infractions involving members  of  the
Service is clear: they will not be tolerated.  SAPS  members  whose  actions
undermine our obligation to our nation have no place in the Police  Service.
They must go. I am looking at the performance audits of members in order  to
weed out misfits.

The department has been trying over the past while to  increase  allocations
for operational expenditure. While 78% of the budget will  be  allocated  to
personnel  expenditure,  the  split  is  rational.  The  22%  that  goes  to
operations will allow us to implement  fully  our  strategic  plan  for  the
financial year.  The  budget  indicates  an  8,6%  increase  from  the  past
allocation. It is a 9,2% increase over the period from 2001-02 to 2004-05.

The current allocation will enable us  to  enlist  approximately  7 100  new
recruits in the 2002-03 financial year. We  will  enlist  8  900  additional
recruits in the next three years. A total of 28 560 new  personnel  will  be
appointed over the MTEF period.  By  the  end  of  that  period  the  police
personnel complement will rise to 147 560

The 7 100 entry level constables we will recruit over the current  financial
year will be trained at police  colleges  in  Pretoria,  Oudtshoorn,  Bisho,
Graaff-Reinet and Chatsworth. Included in the budget is an  amount  of  R215
million  that  is  earmarked  for  the  erection  and  purchase  of   police
facilities.

Hon members will also note that funds that  have  been  allocated  to  store
items and  equipment  have  increased  significantly  compared  to  previous
allocations. Capital spending  to  equip  police  stations  and  the  police
themselves will grow by an annual average of 13,4%.

My immediate objective during the current financial year is to  get  quickly
to  the  point  where  we  must  introduce  effective  policing  in  clearly
demarcated sectors. In the beginning we want to target  areas  that  have  a
high crime concentration.  But,  as  resources  become  available,  we  will
spread out so that we cover the entire country.  The  police  that  will  be
deployed in the new  crime  sectors  will  be  visible,  highly  mobile  and
proactive. Those deployed in  this  manner  will  be  carefully  chosen  and
appropriately resourced. We want them, in the end, to stop crime  before  it
happens.

Sector  policing,  which  will  pick  up  on  the  successes  of   Operation
Crackdown, is also intended to  establish  close  partnerships  between  the
police and communities in  order  to  address  crime  through  a  series  of
multidisciplinary measures.

Following the implementation two years ago of the National  Crime  Combating
Strategy, crime has been going down steadily all over the country. When,  in
February, my predecessor  released  crime  statistics  for  the  first  nine
months of  last  year,  he  indicated  that  robbery,  including  aggravated
robbery, and theft were on the increase.

He also pointed out that the figures for serious  crime  had  stabilised  in
100 out of 145 police precincts,  where  more  than  50%  of  serious  crime
happens.

By the middle of March eight more precincts were brought  under  control  in
the wake of Operation Tsipa, which was launched in  January  by  the  Police
Service. On Monday this week the police started another  operation  to  deal
with the remaining 37 police areas, and we expect results soon.

An important element of our stabilisation programme in the 145 police  areas
will be the adoption of measures to prevent the occurrence of social  crime.
I have already asked the police to do a proper analysis of the  crimes  that
happen in those areas to determine which of them can be addressed by way  of
social crime  prevention  and  socioeconomic  development  programmes.  This
matter will be taken forward in meetings that I intend to have in  the  next
three months with all the provinces and local authorities.

All Public Order Policing  Units  are  being  transformed  into  Area  Crime
Combating  Units  that  will  conduct  intelligence-driven  operations  that
require high force levels. Examples of these will be parallel roadblocks  on
highways and secondary routes, and  cordon-and-search  operations.  This  is
intended to  deal  with  bank  robberies,  cash-in-transit  heists  and  the
hijacking of vehicles, as well as taxi and gang violence.

The SAPS has  already  purchased  almost  50  high-performance  vehicles  to
implement  the  first  phase  of  this  approach  in  all   provinces.   New
helicopters have also been acquired to provide air  support  to  the  mobile
units. It is my view that the air support of the  SAPS  should  be  expanded
further for maximum effect. I am currently discussing  the  matter  with  my
police management and initial indications are that  it  is  possible  to  do
this.

Last  year  the  Service  arrested  100  crime  syndicate  leaders  and  230
organised crime groupings were smashed. Some of the groups  we  busted  were
involved in commercial crimes, such as the Black Dollars and 419  scams,  as
well as ATM fraud. In addition, scams were uncovered regarding credit  cards
involving R12,592 million  and  transactions  using  the  so-called  ``clone
cheques''. Other groups were involved in the theft of precious metals.

Drug-peddling continues to be one of the biggest  crimes.  The  police  were
able  to  identify  and  dismantle  13   laboratories   where   drugs   were
manufactured.

We have an exhibition in front of the Old  Assembly,  which  I  am  inviting
members to please visit, where things such as drugs are on display.

My colleagues in the Criminal Justice Cluster and I will initiate a  meeting
with the  Central  Drug  Authority  to  discuss  the  fast-tracking  of  the
National  Drug  Master  Plan  to  deal,  specifically,  with   drug   demand
reduction.
The  multilateral  police  co-operation  agreement  involving  12   Southern
African countries is an important instrument in the fight against  organised
crime. The agreement  culminated  in  the  birth  of  the  Southern  African
Regional  Police   Chiefs   Co-operation   Organisation.   Some   successful
operations have been pulled off in the past on the basis  of  that  regional
co-operation, and  this  exercise  is  a  direct  contribution  to  the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development.

The gang problem in the Western Cape is  closely  linked  to  illicit  drug-
trafficking. Owing to an upsurge in violent gang activities  over  the  past
few weeks, the SA Police  Service  deployed,  two  weeks  ago,  hundreds  of
additional members in the province  as  part  of  Operation  Slasher.  These
members use modern technology in their work to restore order and to  protect
the lives of innocent members of the public.

This operation will continue until I am satisfied that  people  can  proceed
with their normal lives without any fear of gangs. I would  like  to  appeal
to the public for wholehearted support in the execution of  this  operation.
Police actions in the process may cause some form  or  other  of  discomfort
for law-abiding citizens. It is the criminals that we want  to  corner,  and
we do not want to allow them any space to carry out their  dastardly  deeds.
The measures we have adopted  to  deal  with  this  matter,  therefore,  are
necessary. No quarter must be given to criminals by anyone, least of all  by
the state or by us in the Department of Safety and Security.

Allow me at this point to also direct an appeal to our nation  as  a  whole.
Let us stop fraternising with wrongdoing. One of the problems in  our  fight
against  criminal  gangs  is  that  they  are  protected  by  some  of   our
communities. This protection results from material  assistance  these  gangs
give to some needy families. The fact is that the resources that  are  given
to those families by the  gangsters  are  proceeds  from  various  kinds  of
crime, especially drug-related crimes and armed robberies. This practice  is
wrong.

But we need to rescue those who are imprisoned in this  cycle  of  crime  by
addressing their legitimate socioeconomic needs through efforts such as  the
urban renewal project where  Government,  business  and  other  role-players
should be involved.

We should also not tolerate wrongdoing in whatever form it presents  itself.
If students go on the rampage, as happened in the recent  Cosas  march,  let
us take decisive steps that will be an effective deterrent next time.

Strike action, marches and demonstrations  are  the  rights  that  we  enjoy
under  our  democratic  order.  However,  these  should  never  be  used  as
instruments of destruction.

The action from 23 May by  University  of  the  North  students  is  another
matter that should not be tolerated. The action  was  wrong  and  those  who
committed specific crimes in this regard should  be  brought  to  book.  The
police are  investigating,  among  other  things,  cases  of  arson,  public
violence and rape in respect of that action. Some of the suspects are  being
held at the Mankweng police cells pending their next court appearance.

The police are conducting further investigations into both of the  incidents
that I have referred to and more suspects may be arrested.

We also tend to look the other way when crimes against  women  and  children
happen, and allow perpetrators to get away with murder.  We  simply  do  not
want to be involved, as the saying goes: ``I am not involved.'' But that  is
wrong.

The time has come for our nation to say no to crime and work  together  with
the police to end the scourge. We want to  reiterate,  though,  that  people
must not take the law into their own hands. Vigilantism is also a crime  and
will not be tolerated. The right thing to do  is  to  report  crime  to  the
police.

Many concerned South Africans, especially on the  business  front,  mounted,
together with the Police Service, projects to  improve  victim  empowerment,
especially in regard to women and children. This included the  establishment
of more  than  80  additional  victim  support  centres  at  various  police
stations.

The Automated Fingerprint Identification System that was launched last  year
is fully operational at national level. We are currently decentralising  the
system to  35  sites  throughout  the  country,  18  of  which  are  already
operational. The remaining sites will be up and  running  from  the  end  of
July.

The Afis has a national data base of 4,6 million fingerprints  of  convicted
criminals. There are 90 local criminal record  centres  across  the  country
that have a collection of about 1  million  unidentified  fingerprints.  The
prints were lifted  from  crime  scenes  involving  murder,  rape,  robbery,
housebreaking and the theft of motor vehicles, to mention just a few.  These
prints are currently being checked against the Afis  database,  and  initial
test results indicate that the system is working well. Afis will help us  to
reopen criminal investigations into a large  number  of  cases  that  remain
unresolved.

In the current financial year we  are  going  to  redouble  our  efforts  to
secure our people from the actions of violent groups.

I am beginning to hear ominous rumbles of war drums,  albeit  soft  at  this
stage, and, before they become a crescendo, want to say  that  we  will  not
have political violence again in our country.  Any  person  who  engages  in
this will be arrested and criminally  prosecuted.  The  case  of  the  three
right-wingers who were arrested in Parys, Free State on 26 March  this  year
has been postponed to 14 October for trial in the Bloemfontain  High  Court.
They will face charges of treason, conspiracy and the illegal possession  of
firearms. Three more suspects will appear in  the  Pretoria  High  Court  in
August to face charges of terrorism.

We are going to approach Parliament soon for the ratification of  three  key
international  conventions  relating  to  terrorism.  These  are   the   OAU
Convention on the Combating and Prevention of Terrorism, the  Convention  on
the  Suppression  of  Terrorist  Financing  and  the   Convention   on   the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. The South African Government  is  on  the
verge  of  signing  the  UN  protocol  relating   to   firearms   which   is
supplementary to the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime.

The SADC Protocol on the Control of Firearms and Light Weapons  is  also  on
its way to this House. The final report by the SA Law  Commission  regarding
legislation on terrorism is expected by mid-July this year.  The  Explosives
Act of 1956 is  also  being  reviewed  and  the  introduction,  as  soon  as
possible, of legislation in that regard is also in the pipeline.

The National Secretariat and the  Independent  Complaints  Directorate,  the
civilian oversight bodies that monitor the work of the police,  continue  to
deliver a good service. The secretariat  seeks  to  see  a  change  for  the
better in criminal investigations and the management  and  control  of  case
dockets. This has arisen because cases are  thrown  out  of  court  in  some
instances because of  poor  investigations.  The  other  challenge  for  the
secretariat is the institution of measures to raise the  morale  of  members
of the Service and inculcate discipline all round.

The  ICD,   the   Independent   Complaints   Directorate,   despite   varied
difficulties,  has  made  every  effort  to  ensure  that  it  fulfils   its
legislative  and  constitutional  obligations,  including   its   additional
mandate to monitor the implementation by the SAPS of the  Domestic  Violence
Act and oversight over municipal police  services.  Their  budget  is  R30,3
million  in  the  current  allocation  which  marks,  approximately,  a  17%
increase.

In conclusion, I want to say to hon members that the battle  cry  is  clear.
Crime must be stopped. Adequate human and material resources  must  be  used
to this end. The support of the entire nation, our peace-loving  people,  as
well as the international community is  absolutely  critical  in  our  fight
against crime. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Thank you, hon  Minister.  I  want  to
assure you that the members of Parliament that are  not  in  the  House  are
busy in the committees. They have not run away from the police.

Mr M E GEORGE: Mr Chairperson, hon Deputy President, hon Minister of  Safety
and Security Comrade Charles Nqakula, Ministers present and hon  members,  I
stand here this afternoon to support this Budget Vote.

Section 205(3) of the Constitution states, I quote


  The objects of the police service are to prevent, combat and  investigate
  crime, to maintain public order, to protect and secure the inhabitants of
  the Republic and their property, and to uphold and enforce the law.

From this one can see that these men and women  in  blue  uniforms  probably
have the most important task in this country.  Every  department  and  every
one of us in this country depends on these police members.
Kungoko ndiyibethelelayo, ndiyigxininisa  nakwiKomiti  ejongene  noKhuseleko
noKhuselo kwakunye nasebantwini  ngokubanzi,  into  yokuba  siwaxhase  kwaye
sisebenzisane  namapolisa.   Nokuba   singohluka   kwezombangazwe,   sahluke
ngezimvo, kodwa kulo mcimbi wokulwisana nolwaphulo-mthetho  masithethe  into
enye,  ngokuba  abaphuli-mthetho  benza  into  enye,   bayabulala,   bayeba,
badlwengula iintsana namaxhegokazi.

Yiyo loo nto uMongameli weli lizwe, UThabo Mbeki, wathi  xa  esenza  intetho
ebizwa  ngokuba   yistate-of-the-nation-address:   (Translation   of   Xhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[That is why I emphasise to the Portfolio Committee on Safety  and  Security
and the public that we should give them as much support as we can.  Even  if
we  have  different  political  views,  we  should  speak  with  one   voice
concerning fighting criminality, because criminals talk the  same  language,
they murder, they steal, and they rape children and elderly women.

That is why the President of this country, the hon Mr Thabo Mbeki,  said  in
his state of the nation address:]


  The simple fact that most of the crimes  of  assault  and  murder  happen
  between Friday and Sunday, among people who know one  another,  and  with
  many of them under the influence of alcohol  and  drugs,  speaks  to  the
  critical importance of community organisation and systems of ... censure.



He further said:


  Clearly, many of these crimes, as well as those related to rape, domestic
  violence and child abuse, cannot be policed with any measure  of  success
  by the security agencies acting alone.

Masisebenzisane nto zakuthi,  ukuze  sulwe  nobundlobongela.  [Let  us  work
together, my people, compatriots, to fight violent acts.]

This  budget  goes  a  long  way  in  fulfilling  the  objectives   of   the
Constitution, the vision of  the  President  in  his  state  of  the  nation
address, the vision of the Department of Safety and Security and the  vision
of the Minister as it was outlined yesterday. I must add that  there  is  no
such thing as an adequate budget, as members will  see  when  my  colleagues
speak about the fact that the building of police stations is  still  one  of
the major challenges facing this department.

Let me briefly deal with the causes of crime, the Firearms Control  Act  and
its implementation and the killing of SAPS members. Time  allowing,  I  will
deal with corruption within the service, child abuse and domestic  violence.
My other  comrades  will,  of  course,  deal  with  other  issues  like  the
secretariat and the ICD. I hope they will not think that I do not take  them
seriously, but there are time limitations.

With  regard  to  transformation   and   organised   crime,   the   national
commissioner, Jackie Selebi, said:


  The latest crime statistics reveal that serious crime is stabilising, but
  common assault in on the increase.

He is, however, confident that -


  ... crime will be reduced drastically, but only  when  the  police  start
  implementing sector policing next year.

To back up his assertions, the National Commissioner said:


  The incidence of serious crimes such as murder, robbery and hijackings is
  high compared to October last year, but the January to March figures show
  that such crimes are stabilising. Only common assault stands out  on  the
  register of crime statistics.

But why is assault  on  the  increase?  Again,  according  to  the  National
Commissioner:


  Some crimes are more difficult to police than others. For  example,  rape
  is  less  policeable  than  bank  robberies  or  car  theft  because  the
  overwhelming majority  of  cases  happen  between  people  who  know  one
  another. Most cases of assault take place between  people  who  know  one
  another and are the result of heated arguments.

Furthermore, some explanations for the high levels of  violent  crime  refer
to South Africa's political history, suggesting that families suffered  from
institutional violence for decades through the disruption of their lives  by
mass removals and  the  migrant  labour  policies  of  apartheid.  Political
violence compounded this disruption of family life. The resultant  weakening
of the family unit, loss of parental control over children and  alcohol,  as
well as drug abuse, may prompt criminal behaviour among the youth.

The Institute for Security Studies also  views  rapid  urbanisation,  income
inequality, the population of young people, a weak criminal  justice  system
and the proliferation of firearms as the possible causes  for  higher  crime
levels. Police statistics and daily press reports show that the easy  access
to firearms in South Africa contributes significantly to violent crime.

South Africa has a population of almost 45 million, with almost 1,9  million
licensed firearm owners, who possess nearly 4,1 million  licensed  firearms.
We are one of the most heavily armed societies in the world. We  must  begin
to think seriously about this. Added to this are  5  to  8  million  illegal
firearms, which again are a problem of our past. Years of  conflict  in  the
Southern African region have created  a  surplus  of  weapons.  Professional
organised crime syndicates smuggle the majority of illegal weapons into  the
country. The organised crime syndicates link  various  criminal  activities,
for example vehicle theft, drug smuggling, money laundering and the  illegal
arms trade. The bottom line is that firearm  smuggling  cannot  be  isolated
from wider forms of criminality in which organised syndicates are involved.

The circulation of illegal firearms and the high number  of  violent  crimes
involving the use of firearms force the Government and  the  SAPS  to  focus
strategically on firearms within South Africa. It  was  common  practice  in
the past  for  licensed  firearm-holders  to  lend  out  their  firearms  to
nonlicensees for safekeeping.  Criminal  who  otherwise  could  not  possess
firearms by virtue of their criminal record misused this. I am happy to  say
that this has been addressed. Offenders could legally obtain a firearm  from
their friends or family members for use or safekeeping  and  then  use  such
weapons to commit crimes.

Furthermore, the proportion  of  crimes  involving  firearms  has  increased
faster than crime in general over the last few years. While  the  number  of
murders since 1994 has been declining, the number of murders committed  with
a firearm has increased.  In  1998,  for  example,  49,3%  of  murders  were
committed with  firearms.  Substantial  increases  occurred  in  the  yearly
incidence of reported theft of firearms from 7 285 cases in 1994 to  11  391
in 1998, an increase of 56%. The negligent loss of firearms  also  increased
substantially between 1996 and 1998, by 32%. So  the  people  with  licensed
firearms are also a big problem.

It became clear that South Africa needed a new arms and ammunition Act  that
would encourage responsible management of  legal  firearms  by  all  firearm
owners. The main purposes of the Firearms Control Act, among others, are  to
further the protection of the constitutional rights of everyone to life  and
bodily integrity; to prevent crime involving the use  of  firearms;  and  to
prevent the proliferation of illegally possessed firearms by  providing  for
the removal of those firearms from society and by  improving  controls  over
legal firearms.

The Firearms Control Act represents a major tool to combat  violent  crimes.
The strategy to implement the Act is based on four pillars: the  development
and  maintenance  of  appropriate   firearms-related   regulators;   control
processes and procedures around procurement; the reduction  and  destruction
of illegal firearms; and awareness and social crime prevention initiatives.
During 2002 the following issues will be prioritised as  part  of  the  four
pillars. I will only mention two: section 40 of the  Firearms  Control  Act,
which deals with firearmsfree zones, will be implemented by means  of  pilot
projects in more than 20 schools in the provinces of  Gauteng,  the  Western
Cape, the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal  and  the  North  West.  The  business
process re-engineering project to develop  a  new  firearms  control  system
will be completed in 2002.

What is also urgently needed is to make sure that the police at  the  police
station level  understand  the  Firearms  Control  Act.  The  Institute  for
Security Studies launched in-depth interviews with gun  dealers  and  police
officers seeking to understand the issues  arising  in  the  enforcement  of
firearms legislation. First of all, the concern was raised that many  owners
use their weapons inappropriately or allow others to do so.

This  suggested  that  competency  certificates,  as  required  by  the  new
legislation,  were  desirable.  However,  ensuring  that  the  certification
process actually reflected  that  a  certificate  holder  had  acquired  the
skills, knowledge and attitudes required to safely own  a  gun  would  be  a
challenge.

Police officers, in particular, were concerned about fly-by-nights  and  the
otherwise unethical dealers and trainers. An example of this  was  the  fact
that some police  officers  in  Durban,  for  instance,  suggested  that  an
illegal 9 mm pistol would sell for R300 to R500  while  others  suggested  a
price of R2 000. At the same time, concern was raised about  a  fairly  long
list of police strategies and  tactics  used  to  recover  illegal  weapons,
including  cordon-and-search  operations,  roadblocks   and   the   use   of
informers. In general, there was some acknowledgement that more needs to  be
done to disrupt the illegal firearms market and reduce both the  supply  and
distribution of these weapons.

While police celebrated the  launch  of  a  national  community  and  police
safety campaign in Umtata, another policeman was buried that  weekend.  That
policeman had been killed off duty, which is the  period  when  most  police
officers are killed. The murder of  police  officials  in  South  Africa  is
becoming endemic. Since 1993, more than 200 killings have  occurred  yearly.
From 1994 to the end of June 2000, 1 594 police officers were killed in  the
country. Most of them were killed off duty. From January to May  this  year,
45 police officers were killed, compared to  65  in  the  same  period  last
year.

Research by  the  SAPS  directorate,  which  is  based  on  interviews  with
convicted cop-killers, has shown that motives ranged from  resisting  arrest
- 43,5% - and robbing  police  officers  of  their  firearms  -  8,7%  -  to
concealing corruption  -  4,3%.  The  national  safety  plan  also  includes
sensitising communities who live in red zone areas about their  safety,  and
the safety of the police who  patrol  there.  The  awareness  and  education
campaign will continue throughout the year.

Sicela uluntu ngokubanzi ukuba  luncedisane  noRhulumente,  lwahlukane  nalo
mkhuba  wokubulala  amapolisa.  Neenkundla   zamatyala,   qabane   uPenuell,
mazingathi  ziyaqina  ekugwebeni   ezi   ndlobongela   zibulala   amapolisa.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[We ask that people in general assist the Government,  and  stop  this  very
bad habit of murdering members of the police service.  The  courts,  comrade
Penuell, should give even heavier sentences to  these  criminals  that  kill
police.]

Equipment checks, wearing bulletproof  gear,  not  working  alone,  doing  a
safety analysis of each incident and always having radio contact  will  form
part of the safety procedures. Unfortunately, due  to  time  constraints,  I
have to conclude my speech.

In closing, I want to thank the  members  of  the  portfolio  committee  for
their support. I would like to thank members of the department -  especially
those who work in the legal division. I also want to  mention  the  name  of
Director Garnet this time. I thank them  for  the  support  that  they  have
given the committee. Director Garnet liaises between  us  and  the  National
Commissioner's office. I want to say to him that he should keep up the  good
work.

Let me also thank the policemen and policewomen who are here  and  those  in
the streets preventing crime who, every day of their lives, put their  lives
at risk to protect the citizens of this country. That the prisons  are  full
is an indication that they are doing a good  job.  I  want  to  say  to  the
National Commissioner and his team that they should keep up the  good  work.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Adv P S SWART: Mr Chairman, hon Minister, allow me  to  welcome  the  senior
management of the police and the police officers who are  sitting  up  there
in the public gallery of  this  House.  I  would  like  to  immediately  pay
tribute to their loyalty and  the  diligent  work  which  they  do  in  very
difficult circumstances in our  ongoing  all-out  war  against  crime  which
plagues our country so much. I would also like to welcome the management  of
the ICD, who also play an important role in our fledgling democracy.

As responsible parliamentarians, we  need  to  evaluate  the  SAPS's  recent
performance in terms of the fulfilment of its all-important mandate  imposed
by our Constitution: to ensure the safety and security of all the people  of
this country. Only then can we assess the sufficiency or not of this  year's
budget allocation. In this regard, it is fitting to start with the  ICD  and
I shall do so.

As an oversight body whose main purpose is to investigate deaths  in  police
custody  as  a  result  of  police  action  and  complaints   about   police
criminality and misconduct, it serves well as an indicator of  the  internal
police climate. I would like to tell the Minister that this internal  police
climate seems robust, to say the least. From 1 April  2001  to  31  December
2001, an increase of 47% has been experienced  in  the  case  of  deaths  in
custody compared to the corresponding  period  in  the  year  2000.  Serious
criminal offences  committed  by  police  members  almost  doubled  in  this
period, with an increase from 184 to  340,  while  incidents  of  misconduct
rose by 36%. I would like to say to the Minister that during the same  time,
the number of  police  officers  went  further  down,  crime  stabilised  at
already unacceptably high levels and the result was a  further  increase  of
the workload on our diligent and loyal officers. The Minister would need  to
take a serious look at these ICD  indicators  regarding  criminality  within
the SAPS itself.

Returning to the ICD budget, during the past two  years  the  ICD  has  been
grossly underfinanced. In 2001 they indicated  to  the  portfolio  committee
that they would have to stop operations in September 2001. Due  to  internal
diligence and prioritisation they, however, managed.  They  indicated,  this
year, their satisfaction with this budget which is on the Table today.  They
received an increase  of  over  30%  for  Programme  2  -  Investigation  of
Complaints, and an overall increase of 17%.

Die DA is tevrede met die programme en die strategiese beplanning en is  van
mening dat die interne situasie in die SAPS steeds  hulle  bestaan  en  werk
regverdig. [The DA  is  satisfied  with  the  programme  and  the  strategic
planning and is of the opinion that  the  internal  situation  in  the  SAPS
still justifies their existence and work.]

We in this country witnessed a  very  strange  phenomenon  during  the  last
couple of years. Whilst there was a 26%  increase  in  crime  from  1994  to
2001, a closer scrutiny reveals  that  crime  actually  came  down,  however
marginally, from 1994 to 1997 before it started its steep incline to an all-
time high in 2000,  with  major  increases  in  all  violent  crimes  except
murder. The strange thing was that during the same time, from 1997 to  2001,
whilst crime went up, the number of police officers in the  SAPS  just  went
down, and down, and down, with an  average  of  4  000  to  5  000  officers
leaving the force yearly without being replaced.

Ek is die eerste persoon wat erken dat die aantal  polisiebeamptes  nie  die
enigste   kriterium   is   om    misdaad    effektief    te    beveg    nie.
Ontplooiingstrategieë, beskikbare  hulpmiddele,  moraal  en  verskeie  ander
faktore speel net so 'n belangrike  rol.  Daar  is  sekerlik  'n  korrelasie
tussen misdaadvlakke en die polisiemannekrag wat beskikbaar is  om  dit  aan
te spreek. Alhoewel ons gunstig mag vergelyk met die res van die wêreld  wat
betref die aantal inwoners per polisiebeampte, vergelyk ons misdaadvlakke  -
in  die  besonder  geweldsmisdade  -  uiters  ongunstig.   (Translation   of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I am the first person to admit that the number of police  officers  is  not
the only criterion for effectively combating crime.  Deployment  strategies,
available resources, morale and various other factors play just as  vital  a
role. There  certainly  is  a  correlation  between  crime  levels  and  the
available manpower of the police which is needed to address  them.  Although
we may compare favourably with the rest of the world  where  the  number  of
citizens per police officer is concerned, our crime levels - especially  the
violent crimes - compare most unfavourably.]

In particular, one needs manpower if one finds oneself in a situation  where
one sometimes cannot properly respond  to  complaints.  I  shall  not  today
terrify the House with cases  of  raped  women,  defenceless  minors,  dying
victims and helpless citizens waiting in vain for police assistance  -  this
when the ultimate  goal  to  strive  for  is  not  the  response  to  crimes
committed, but  the  availability  of  sufficient  visible  crime-prevention
units to deter criminals from committing  these  outrageous  crimes  in  the
first place.

It is on record that the DA and its  constituent  parties  in  recent  years
opposed this Budget Vote for just this reason. We stood in  this  House  and
indicated repeatedly the need  for  more  well-trained  and  better-equipped
police officers whilst being shouted down as irresponsible  and  unpatriotic
and as opposing for the sole purpose of  opposing.  The  truth  is  that  we
care. We care for all the people in this country.  In  particular,  we  care
for our police officers, as underresourced as they  are.  The  irresponsible
action came from this Government  which,  through  its  failure  to  address
that, added to the ever-increasing list of victims and, in  truth,  dismally
failed the people of this country - all this whilst those remaining  in  the
police  in  ever-diminishing  numbers  fought  the  fight  valiantly,   with
distinction and against all odds. I salute them for that.

But let us look at the more recent past. While  police  numbers  reached  an
all-time low during 2001, they managed,  through  hard  work,  to  stabilise
crime to  some  extent.  However,  we  need  to  scrutinise  this  so-called
stabilisation.  It  is  mainly  reflected  as  such  because,  against  high
increases in violent crimes like aggravated robbery, the  murder  rate  came
down by 24%. Did that happen because we are winning the fight? No.  I  would
like to tell fellow members that we are, at best, just starting to curb  the
high tide.

The  murder  rate  itself  deserves  scrutiny.  It  is  still,  despite  the
decrease, amongst the highest in the world. But then,  using  murder  as  an
indicator of police effectiveness is highly suspect.  Murder,  in  its  very
essence, is a very difficult crime to prevent. According to police  surveys,
70% of murder victims knew their murderers. A survey by  the  Institute  for
Security Studies found that 50% of victims knew the offenders by name and  a
further 12% knew them by sight.

I will leave crime statistics and the numbers of police  officers  for  now,
although I must tell the Minister that I  regard  the  alleged  decision  by
Cabinet that statistics will only be released on a  12-month  basis  as,  to
say the least, very unfortunate. People need to know what the  situation  is
regularly. Being kept in the dark will have a demoralising effect,  not  the
other way round. We saw that last year with the moratorium.

The reason why I will stop harping on police numbers and  crime  figures  is
that, at last, and maybe not too late,  in  this  year's  Budget  Government
seems to accept some responsibility for  the  safety  and  security  of  its
people with the allocation for an additional 16  000  police  officers  over
the next three years. Maybe this will prove to be  the  greatest  legacy  of
the late Minister Tshwete: at last and to some extent to empower  our  brave
police officers to do their job. I shall not  claim  vindication  for  this,
although we asked for it and more, for years, because lives  are  at  stake,
and I appreciate this decision. Once again,  in  true  spirit,  the  police,
however incapacitated through diminishing  resources,  did  proper  training
planning and we  should  see  25  100  new  police  officers  going  through
training in  the  next  three  years  to  make  provision  also  for  normal
attrition.

The hon the Minister is indeed fortunate to be able to start with this  long
overdue assistance from his colleague, Minister Manuel. But this  will  only
bring fruition in our  fight  against  crime  if  it  is  complemented  with
sufficient  resources,  vehicles,   upgraded   police   stations   and   the
continuation and speeding up of sector  policing  in  particular,  in  those
identified areas.

The DA also welcomes the much greater emphasis in this year's budget on  the
programme for crime prevention. Only once we see those  much-awaited,  well-
resourced and well-trained officers on our streets can  we,  as  a  country,
maybe come out of hiding from behind our burglar  bars  and  security  gates
and be free at last, with the criminals off our streets, out of  our  houses
and businesses, and safely behind bars.

Die aankondiging oor polisielede en groter  fokus  op  misdaadvoorkoming  is
welkome nuus, maar ver van voldoende. Ons evaluering vandag moet  verder  as
dit gaan. Slegs met 'n totale aanslag kan  ons  suksesvol  wees  in  hierdie
felle stryd  teen  misdaad.  Slegs  met  algehele  geïntegreerde  oorsig  en
onmiddellike optrede, optimale benutting van die  skaars  hulpbronne,  asook
die aandag aan  verskeie  knelpunte  wat  dienslewering  bemoeilik,  sal  'n
sukses van hierdie moeilike taak gemaak kan word. Ek moet vandag  verwys  na
enkele van hierdie aspekte.

Die eerste is die ontplooiing van  polisielede.  By  Johannesburg  Sentraal,
een van ons grootste polisiestasies in die middel van ons misdaadstad,  waar
soveel as 136 uit elke  100  000  inwoners  elke  jaar  vermoor  word,  waar
gewapende roof en  motorkapings  hoogty  vier,  sit  20%  van  die  lede  in
administratiewe poste en nog 20%  is  voltyds  besig  met  bewakingsdienste.
Daar is steeds te veel funksionele polisiebeamptes in administratiewe  poste
regoor die land. Lede wat sigbaar op straat moet wees, moet besig  wees  met
misdaadvoorkoming. Ons verwelkom die aanduidings om dit aan te spreek.

'n  Verdere  probleem  is   hulpmiddele.   Genoeg   is   gepraat   oor   die
voertuigsituasie in die polisie, met sy onvoldoende voertuie,  en  verkeerde
voertuie wat gebruik word  in  ons  landelike  gebiede,  waar  onherbergsame
gebiede met Citi Golfs bedien word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The  announcement  about  police  members  and  greater  focus  on   crime-
prevention is welcomed, but far from sufficient. Our evaluation  today  must
go further than that. We can only be successful in this fierce battle if  we
declare a total onslaught on crime. Only with overall  integrated  oversight
and immediate action, optimal utilisation of scarce resources,  as  well  as
attention to various issues that hamper service delivery, can this  task  be
successful.I must today refer to some of these aspects.

The first is the deployment of police members. At Johannesburg Central,  one
of the biggest police stations in the centre of our crime capital, where  as
many as 136 out of every 100 000 citizens are  murdered  every  year,  where
armed  robbery  and  hijacking  are  rife,  20%  of  the  members   are   in
administrative posts and another 20%  are  fully  occupied  with  performing
protection services. There are still too many functional police officers  in
administrative posts throughout the country. Members who must be visible  on
the street must be engaged in crime prevention.

Resources are another problem.  Enough  has  been  said  about  the  vehicle
situation in the police service, with its  inadequate  number  of  vehicles,
and vehicles  that  are  unsuitable  for  use  in  our  rural  areas,  where
inhospitable areas must be served with Citi Golfs.]

I would like to tell the Minister that Citi Golfs mean just that - Golfs  to
be utilised in city conditions. And I will not even mention police  officers
who are without valid driving licences.
Met hulpmiddele verwys ek ook na die  feit  dat  die  enkele  lede  van  ons
polisiemag wat wel misdaad beheer en by die voorkoming daarvan betrokke  is,
dikwels  nie  voldoende  radios,  boeie  of  wapens  beskikbaar   het   nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[When I am talking about resources I am also referring to the fact that  the
few members of the police force who do actually combat  crime  and  who  are
involved  in  crime  control  and  crime  prevention,  often  do  not   have
sufficient radios, handcuffs and firearms.]

Bulletproof vests are not an option in South Africa but  a  necessity.  This
lack of sufficient resources is seriously hampering our effectiveness.

Op  die  platteland  is  die  situasie  dikwels  erger.  Hierdie   oorwerkte
polisielede  moet  terugkeer  na  stasies,  in   verskeie   gevalle   sonder
elektrisiteit,   water,   telefone,   faksmasjiene    en    rekenaargeriewe.
Polisiestasies  -  en  ons  besoek  hulle   -   val   partykeer   uitmekaar.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The situation in the rural areas is often worse.  These  overworked  police
members must return to stations, in various instances  without  electricity,
water, telephones, fax machines and computer facilities. Police  stations  -
and we visit them - are sometimes falling to pieces.]

How will we properly implement Afis or deploy designated police officers  to
all stations without telephone lines or computers? This  is  something  that
needs to be addressed immediately. Yesterday the Minister  undertook  to  do
so. I am once again reminding the Minister that  we  need  to  address  this
immediately.

Ons sit ook met groot getalle lede wat nie behoorlik opgelei is nie.  Verder
is 25% van die polisiemag funksioneel ongeletterd. Kan ons verbaas  wees  in
die Huis as slegs 9% gerapporteerde sake  tot  suksesvolle  vervolging  lei?
Daar is probleme in Justisie en die probleem lê nie net by  die  Departement
van Veiligheid en Sekuriteit nie.

Ons moet te veel hoor van swak en onvoldoende verklarings deur lede  gedoen,
wanneer sake ondersoek word. Ondersoeke sloer dikwels  maande,  selfs  jare,
wat  die  kans  op  suksesvolle  vervolging  kortwiek.  Getuies  vergeet  of
verdwyn. Verdagtes verdwyn. Getuienis verdwyn en mettertyd verdwyn ook  alle
kanse op skuldigbevindings. Verhoorafwagtende gevangenes  is  gemiddeld  139
dae in aanhouding voor die hofsaak afgehandel  word.  Hiermee  saam  is  die
gebrek aan voldoende opgeleide  speurders.  Suid-Afrika  vergelyk  inderdaad
sleg met die res van die wêreld wat betref die verhouding speurders  teenoor
saakdossiere wat behartig moet word, veral wat betref ernstige misdade.  Die
koördinering tussen speurders van spesifiek moorddossiere en die  vervolgers
in Justisie skiet tekort. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We also have large numbers of members who have not been  properly  trained.
Furthermore, 25% of the police force is functionally illiterate. Can  we  in
the House be surprised if only 9%  of  reported  cases  lead  to  successful
prosecution? Problems exist in Justice and the problem is not only with  the
Department of Safety and Security.

We have to hear too often of poor and  insufficient  statements  by  members
when cases are investigated. Investigations often drag on for  months,  even
years, which  impedes  the  chances  of  successful  prosecution.  Witnesses
forget or disappear. Suspects disappear. Evidence disappears, and with  time
all hope of conviction disappears.  Awaiting-trial  prisoners  are  detained
for 139 days on average before the court case is over. Coupled with this  is
the shortage of  sufficiently  qualified  detectives.  Indeed  South  Africa
compares poorly with the rest of the  world  in  respect  of  its  ratio  of
detectives to pending  case  dockets,  especially  so  relating  to  serious
crimes. The co-ordination between detectives with  specific  murder  dockets
and the prosecutors in Justice is lacking.]

I recently alluded to the lack of capacity in the forensic  department.  The
Minister stated that this would be sorted out. I will follow  this  progress
with interest.

On reflection, the overall picture does look  bleak.  Our  evaluation  shows
that out of 100 000 functional police officers we only have approximately  8
000 constables. Too many members are in offices and too few on our  streets.
This is the bottom line. Although the Minister did not  cause  this,  it  is
the Minister's responsibility to sort out all the problems I  mentioned.  As
long as the Minister is sincere in addressing these problems,  the  DA  will
support and assist him.

We are heartened by the recent strategic and planning briefings from  senior
management, as well as a number of remarks the Minister has  made.  But,  of
course, plans and actions are often far  apart  and  take  a  long  time  in
coming into place. With more budgetary assistance the Minister  can  succeed
and remain focused on these challenges.

Die grootste vraag na ons evaluasie is natuurlik  of  hierdie  begrotingspos
voldoende prioriteite binne die nasionale raamwerk geniet.  En  die  tweede,
maar hiermee  gelykstaande,  of  die  geld  wat  wel  bewillig  is,  volgens
aanduiding, voldoende en met die departement se prioritisering na die  regte
program gekanaliseer word. Die antwoord op die groot vraag is egter: Nee.

Myns insiens vind daar nie voldoende befondsing van dié departement uit  die
begroting nie. Al die probleme wat ek aangedui het, word nie  in  ag  geneem
nie. Ook ongelukkig nie as die Minister van Finansies voldoende geld het  om
R15 miljard as belastinggeskenk uit te deel nie. Ons is almal  bly  daaroor.
Dit is my beskeie mening dat die groot getalle misdaadslagoffers in  hierdie
land veel eerder veilig sou wou voel, as om 'n paar ekstra rand in  die  sak
te hê. Ons kan ook nie so voel  nie,  aangesien  miljarde  rande  gespandeer
word op die skandalige en kontroversiële wapentransaksie.

Die tweede vraag kan ek soos volg antwoord: Ek is tevrede dat met  die  nuwe
rigting wat die departement ingeslaan het met die  klem  op  die  aanvulling
van   die   polisie   se   mannekrag,   asook   die    implementering    van
sektorpolisiëring  en  sigbare  misdaadvoorkoming,  word  my  tweede   vraag
inderdaad positief beantwoord. Dit is 'n aanduiding  dat  dit  waarvoor  ons
jare gevra het, uiteindelik aandag geniet en ons is  dankbaar  daarvoor.  My
mening is dat die SAPS se begroting vir 2002-03 ons  vorentoe  neem  in  die
opdraande stryd teen misdaad  en  die  beperkte  geld  -  alhoewel  ver  van
voldoende - reg aangewend sal word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The biggest question after our  assessment  is,  of  course,  whether  this
budgetary post enjoys sufficient priority  within  the  national  framework.
The second but equivalent question, is whether the funds that have  in  fact
been appropriated, according to indications, is  sufficient  and,  with  the
department's prioritising, directed to the right programme.  The  answer  to
the big question, however, is no.

In my view there  is  insufficient  funding  of  this  department  from  the
budget. None the problems I have mentioned, are  taken  into  consideration.
Neither, unfortunately, when the Minister of Finance  has  sufficient  funds
to donate R15 billion as a gift of revenue. We are all pleased about it.  It
is my humble opinion that the large numbers of  victims  of  crime  in  this
country would far rather feel safe than have an extra  few  rands  in  their
pockets. Nor can we feel like  that,  since  billions  of  rands  are  being
expended on the scandalous and controversial arms deal.

The second question I can answer as follows: I am satisfied  that  with  the
new course  followed  by  the  department,  which  places  the  emphasis  on
supplementing the police manpower, as well implementing sector policing  and
visible crime-prevention, my second question is indeed answered  positively.
This is an indication that what we have been asking for over  the  years  is
finally getting attention and we are grateful for that. My opinion  is  that
the budget of the SAPS for 2002-03 takes us forward  in  the  uphill  battle
against crime and the limited funds - although far from  sufficient  -  will
be correctly utilised.]

If the Minister of  Finance  were  to  come  to  the  party  with  financial
assistance, we may just succeed. I had 16 minutes and could  only  touch  on
half of the issues that  need  to  be  addressed.  This  must  indicate  how
complex and tough the crime problem is that  our  police  have  to  face.  I
trust that the years to come, with increased safety  and  security  for  all
our people and all criminals behind bars where  they  deserve  to  be,  will
give justification to this expressed confidence to our police officers.

Lastly, I want to thank members of the portfolio committee from all  parties
for the sensible and constructive way we worked together to  focus  most  of
the time on effective policing and its problems. [Applause.]

Mr R P ZONDO: Chairperson, Minister for Safety and Security, members of  the
SAPS and hon members, the ANC welcomes and appreciates the increase  of  the
SAPS budget for the year 2002-03. The fact is that the SAPS  has  identified
crime in terms of its strategic plan. One of these priorities is  to  combat
crime, organised crime and gangsterism. My presentation will  focus  on  two
areas.

The triumph of justice over injustices during 1994 in our country led  South
Africa to gain worldwide recognition, something  that  we,  as  peace-loving
people, are proud of. On the other  hand,  the  world  experienced  a  rapid
expansion of organised crime and transnational criminal  activities  planned
and executed by sophisticated criminal  networks  that  consider  the  world
their global village. The end of the  Cold  War  and  transformation  of  an
authoritarian system towards democracy  in  different  parts  of  the  world
signalled a new era of open borders.

South Africans have not  been  left  untouched  by  these  developments.  In
response, the South African state  declared  organised  crime  syndicates  a
priority and provided additional resources for the police  to  combat  them.
This included gangsters.

The National  Crime  Combating  Strategy  was  developed  to  implement  and
identify priorities. This resulted in the establishment of  organised  crime
project teams. Their approach is to focus  on  key  syndicates  rather  than
individual crimes. Investigating teams are multidisciplinary, ensuring  that
an integrated approach is used.

Other  measures  to  combat  gangsterism  and  organised  crime  include   a
multilateral regional co-operation agreement that has been signed  regarding
police co-operation for the southern region, to which our hon  Minister  has
already  referred.  This  has  led  to   numerous   effective   cross-border
operations.

Syndicates specialise in drugs, car hijacking, fraud  and  money  laundering
and  cash-in-transit  heists.  Many  violent  crimes  in  the  country  have
occurred because of the  abuse  of  narcotics  and  other  substances.  Most
people arrested for violent crimes such as car hijacking are found  to  have
used narcotics. To understand  gangsterism  and  organised  crime,  we  must
realise that criminals work  at  different  levels  of  sophistication.  The
smuggling of commodities which include drugs, diamonds,  stock  and  weapons
forms an integral part of gangsterism and is reason  for  the  existence  of
concern regarding future developments. The interaction between gang  members
and organised crime leaders must therefore never be underestimated.

These are the challenges we face. It is heartening to realise that the  SAPS
is committed to empowering police stations. It would be appreciated if  this
strategy could focus on those stations and areas where most of the crime  is
being committed and empower the police  stations  where  the  resources  are
really needed. At  the  same  time,  infrastructure  is  necessary,  and  at
station level it is important to ensure that crime intelligence is fed  from
grassroots level into the information system of the SAPS. The docket  system
needs to be addressed. Serious crimes are not well attended and as a  result
leave much to be desired.

It  would  be  appreciated  if  a  timeframe  could  be  set  up  for   such
infrastructures. We recognise that the  SAPS  is  part  and  parcel  of  our
community.  The  responsibility  to  combat  crime  is  just   as   much   a
responsibility of our community. The SAPS is succeeding by leaps and  bounds
in the National Crime Combating Strategy. The recent  raid  of  a  container
ship transporting 168 kg of cocaine in Saldanha Bay  was  the  biggest  drug
bust with an estimated street value of R325 million. According to  the  SAPS
they block 160 tons reaching young kids in South Africa.

The SA Police Service have gathered extensive information  on  a  number  of
syndicates operating in  the  country.  The  present  money  laundering  and
racketeering in the Western Cape, which  make  some  leaders  of  a  certain
party restless in this House, are just the tip of the iceberg in the  SAPS's
commitment to fight crime.

The ANC Government will continue to support  them  in  their  fight  against
crime and remains firmly behind them in their stance on combating crime.  We
showed commitment when the President made a national call for volunteers  to
assist with safety and security. Our people responded in greater numbers  at
all levels.

It is my belief that we need to strengthen  the  spirit  of  Vukuzenzele  by
raising public awareness about the negative impact of dirty money and  money
laundering. When dirty money penetrates our economy and starts  to  outweigh
clean  money,  a  key  consequence  is  the  reality  of  the  jobless.   It
destabilises our social economy. The public could  be  trained  in  existing
adult basic education training, or Abet, programmes.

The Government recognises the role of the  unions  within  SAPS.  These  are
Sapu and Popcru. I want to take this opportunity to call  for  these  unions
to  unite.  This  call  requires  a  political  intervention  as  they  have
demonstrated a lack of political  will  to  recognise  that  their  internal
differences have an impact on effective service delivery.

Ka lebaka la gore tau tsa hloka seboka  di  sitwa  ke  nare  e  hlotsa.  [We
cannot achieve anything if we are divided.]

I stand here representing a party with a culture  of  democratic  tradition,
the ANC, and one of its mandates is to unite the people of this country  and
Africa as a whole. I wish to call upon all  South  Africans  to  take  hands
with our sons  and  daughters  in  the  Police  Service  in  combating  this
monster, crime, and ensuring a safe  community,  which  will  attract  much-
needed investment, thereby  facilitating  economic  growth,  and  to  expose
those who are engaged in criminal activities such as  money  laundering.  My
call also includes members who appear to be a laughing stock in  the  public
eye.

Ke re go bona ke bona bo  maganagobuswa,  e  lego  gona  bo  sako  la  hloka
thobela ke mojano.

Ge ke ruma, ke rata go topa Morena Paul Swart nta mo  thekeng.  (Translation
of Pedi paragraphs follows.)

[I say to them they are ungovernable, people who take advantage if there  is
no established authority.

In conclusion, I would like to quote Mr Paul Swart.]
I deeply appreciate Adv Swart's areas of concern.  It  is  unfortunate  that
his party is currently under the  disgruntled  Dene  Smuts,  Tony  Leon  and
Douglas Gibson, who have nothing to offer to  the  country  except  to  howl
insults at prominent people of our beloved country.

Mr M J ELLIS: You are spoiling a fairly good speech.

Mr R P ZONDO: Relax.

Mr M J ELLIS: I will not relax as long as you are talking rubbish.

Mr R P ZONDO: The respected citizens of our country are  not  interested  in
all this. It is my belief that if such  inputs  had  been  made  during  the
leadership of Helen Suzman, Dr  Alex  Boraine  and  Van  Zyl  Slabbert,  the
stalwarts of the former PFP, they would have welcomed this in  a  much  more
constructive manner than the way the hon Mr Ellis is doing  at  the  moment,
panicking.

Ke rata gore go Morena Paul Swart, ka  gore  bjale  ngwedi  o  apogetswe  ke
maru, le nna ke hlapi holofela leraga gobane meetse a pshele o a  lebeletse.
Le wena madiba a gago a pshele. (Translation of Pedi paragraph follows.)

[I would like to say to Mr Paul Swart, because the truth is out, that  I  am
holding on to what I have. You no longer have anywhere to run to.]

Hope and I are old friends.

Mina nethemba lami singabangani abadala. [My hope and I are old friends.]

Ka go realo ke re go ya ka magoro ga  se  go  tswana.  [Legofi.]  [Until  we
meet. [Applause.]]

Mr  V  B  NDLOVU:  Sihlalo,  iNdlu   ehloniphekile,   mhlonishwa   Mongameli
nabahlonishwa  bonke  abakhona,  namalungu  ePhalamende,  ...  [Chairperson,
honourable House, President and hon members in this House ...]

... it is important to see where the police came from  and  where  they  are
going. The IFP wants to congratulate the police  on  the  implementation  of
the National Crime Combating Strategy,  which  was  the  brainchild  of  the
former Minister, the late Mr Tshwete. The implementation of sector  policing
will give more teeth to the police and encourage trust between them and  the
communities they serve. Right now the work of the police should be to  clamp
down on crime, thereby reducing it in the eyes of  the  public  and  of  the
people. Police can only do that if the communities they  serve  trust  them.
The IFP therefore will not tolerate the criminal elements in the police  and
the police management must eradicate those elements.

The tactic of the police is the fulfilment of the  constitutional  directive
and the implementation of the code of conduct within  the  organisation.  In
terms of the Constitution, the major issue is the  proper  investigation  of
crimes in order to obtain proper convictions.

The joint strategy among the three departments must be  fulfilled  when  the
police have arrested the  criminals.  The  courts  must  prosecute  and  the
prisons must imprison. The killing of the late Mr  Sikhonde,  the  mayor  of
Nongoma, is a case in point. The death of  isekela  lenkosi  yakwaButhelezi,
ubaba uNdlovu [the deputy chief of the Buthelezi tribe, Mr Ndlovu]  is  also
a case in point which I want to use as an example. This person was  shot  in
his sleep. In this case, too, nobody has been arrested up to now and  we  do
not know what is happening.

I therefore appeal to the police not to be politically  manoeuvred  when  it
comes to certain cases, because that would  diminish  the  standing  of  the
police in the eyes of the public. The police  must  investigate  and  arrest
criminals, no matter who they are and where they come from.

With the employment of recruits from different  areas,  the  IFP  recommends
that demographics be considered when making up the number  lost.  If  a  few
police have been  lost  in  a  particular  province,  that  province  should
receive an equivalent amount. The more populated the  province,  the  better
equipped the police there should  be  in  terms  of  human  resources.  That
should be the case in order to fulfil the mandate of the visibility  of  the
police.

Last time I spoke on this Vote, I raised a point about the training  of  the
police in human rights. I want to emphasise the  point  again,  so  that  we
avoid civil claims against the department and the police.

I would like to establish the reason for not building new  police  stations,
especially in the rural areas. In 1998 I asked this question  and  used  the
example of Taylors police station. At that time the station was a  satellite
police station. After that it was upgraded into a full police  station,  but
no building has occurred since then. In 2000 I  was  told  that  the  police
station concerned was number 33  in  the  programme  of  the  Department  of
Public Works. What position is it in now? Nobody knows, and they  are  still
stuck with dilapidated buildings there.

I am using this as an example because I do believe that the  department  has
a way of building new police stations. I need to see it happen.

While I am talking about this, I hope  that  the  relationship  between  the
SAPS  and  the  Department  of  Public  Works  has  improved  so  that   the
dilapidated buildings of the old police stations can be eliminated.

The IFP welcomes the training of police personnel, so that  members  of  the
service can be relieved of their desk work and do active policing,  and  the
employment of civil servants to man police desks. That should  increase  the
number of police on the ground. The IFP hopes that this will  happen  as  it
came directly from the President's address to the nation.

The IFP also agrees with the portfolio committee, which is led  by  the  hon
member Mluleki George, that recruits should not be required to have  driving
licences when applying for posts, but that the police college  should  teach
them how to drive. If this requirement  is  enforced,  it  will  hinder  the
disadvantaged young people who would like to join the Police Service.

Abantu   abaqhamuka   emakhaya   nje   okungakaze   kube   nezimoto    kuwo,
bayokufundaphi ukushayela? [Where are people who come from the rural  areas,
where there are no cars, going to learn to drive a car?]

The Department of Safety and Security must improve its service in  order  to
provide careers within the department for young people. The  involvement  of
South African technikons and colleges should be greater in  this  regard  in
order to improve the service so that there are careers in the service.

When students enter the service they should be able to choose which line  of
duty they prefer. That will necessitate the  improvement  of  the  detective
and forensic sections. The gathering of statistics alone  will  be  a  major
task, and therefore cause for intervention or analysis.

The Independent Complaints  Directorate,  from  the  IFP's  point  of  view,
should  be  allocated  to  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development in order for it to be able to do its work  without  interference
from the police. At this moment there are cases that  are  referred  to  the
police for investigation by the ICD. This  is  incorrect.  There  are  areas
where the ICD has to rely on the police for work to be done. If the  purpose
of the ICD is to investigate what the police have done, then it  cannot  and
must not use police buildings, investigation facilities and  information  to
do its work. We must confirm its position as an independent body.

There is a need for the ICD, but  not  under  the  Ministry  of  Safety  and
Security. I therefore request that the political debate on the matter  start
immediately, so that the matter can be debated and finalised.

Finally, I would like  to  thank  the  late  hon  Minister  Mr  Tshwete  for
excellent work done to improve the morale and standing  of  the  police.  We
welcome the new Minister and hope that we will continue to work with him  in
the same vein as we did with the late Minister. [Applause.]

Mnr J SCHIPPERS: Voorsitter, agb lede, die laaste twee jaar in die lewe  van
die ontslape Minister Steve Tshwete het hy gewy aan  die  stabilisering  van
en afname in  die  misdaadstatistiek  in  Suid-Afrika  volgens  die  jongste
syfers. Hy het 'n goeie grondslag  gelê,  en  die  nuwe  Minister  kan  dit,
tesame met die begroting wat  vandag  dien,  gebruik  om  die  misdaadvlakke
verder af te bring ten einde beleggersvertroue en werkgeleenthede te skep.

Deur hierdie begroting wys die Regering sy erns om misdaad vas te  vat.  Die
begroting en die strategiese plan van die SAPD  oor  die  medium  termyn  is
reeds daarop gefokus. Dit sal  die  Minister  en  Nasionale  Kommissaris  in
staat stel om hul doelwitte te bereik.

Die begroting reflekteer 'n verhoging van R5,26 miljard oor vier  jaar,  met
'n sterk fokus op misdaadvoorkoming, 43,46%; administrasie, 28,93%;  en  die
speurdiens en misdaadintelligensie, 20,33%.

Daar  moet  kritiek  uitgespreek  word,  as  dit  nodig  is,  maar  ook  lof
toegeswaai  word  as  welslae  en  sukses  behaal  is.  Die  SAPD   het   'n
indrukwekkende strategiese plan vir die tydperk 2002 tot 2005 opgestel.  Ons
hoop van harte dat die meeste leemtes en  gebreke  in  die  organisering  en
administrasie van die  SAPD  opgelos  sal  word  en  ook  dat  die  volgende
probleemgebiede aangespreek sal word:  die  laksheid  en  ongedissiplineerde
optrede  van  polisiebeamptes;  foutiewe  prosedure  by  die  hantering  van
forensiese  inligting  en  ongelukke   en   misdaadtonele;   bewerings   dat
polisiebeamptes by misdaad betrokke is; kindermishandeling; verkragting  van
weerlose vroue en  kinders;  bendegeweld,  boendoehowe  en  vigilantes;  die
verdwyning  van  dossiere  uit  polisiestasies;  die  werkomstandighede  van
polisiebeamptes; en die toestand van polisiestasies.

Onder die opskrif, ``Tshwete sou trots gewees het,''  het  die  Nuwe  NP  'n
persverklaring uitgereik waarin die sukses en welslae van die afgelope  jaar
gelys word.  Ek  noem  slegs  'n  paar  voorbeelde:  in  Die  Burger  van  2
Februarie, ``711 vas in Operasie  Tsipa'';  in  Die  Burger  van  17  Maart,
``Grootste kokaïenvonds nog  in  die  Kaapse  hawe  gekonfiskeer'';  in  die
Volksblad van 14 April, ``Die polisie stel bedrogsindikaat aan  die  kaak'';
volgens  Sapa  op  18  April,  ``695  verdagtes  in   hegtenis   geneem   in
Johannesburg''; luidens 'n persverklaring van 6 Junie, ``Polisiemoorde  daal
met 31%''. Dit dui aan dat daar duisende toegewyde beamptes is wat hul  werk
nougeset doen.

Die  Suid-Afrikaanse  politieke  gemeenskap   plaas   'n   hoë   premie   op
deursigtigheid. Dit is van kardinale  belang  dat  dit  deurlopend  en  deur
almal toegepas moet word. Tydens die ontmoeting tussen die  poliesievakbonde
en die portefeuljekomitee, moes ek agterkom  dat  hulle  nie  insae  in  die
begroting gehad het nie. Tog moes hulle daaroor praat.  Die  is  onregverdig
en onaanvaarbaar.

Die verteenwoordigers van Sapu, Popcru  en  SA  Technikon  het  insiggewende
aanbevelings gemaak. Ek vestig die Raad se aandag op 'n vraag  wat  deur  'n
Popcru-lid gevra is: Waarom moet 'n polisiebeampte  bevordering  ontvang  om
op 'n groter salaris aanspraak te maak? Ek glo die tyd  het  aangebreek  dat
die SA Technikon as navorser 'n merietesisteem moet ontwikkel  wat  dit  vir
die polisieman of polisievrou moontlik sal maak om meer  te  verdien  sonder
om bevorder te word.

Die Onafhanklike Klagtedirektoraat het nog nie tot sy volle reg  gekom  nie.
Verskeie redes word  hiervoor  aangevoer.  Hulle  doen  baie  belangrike  en
noodsaaklike werk wat deur die gemeenskap benut moet word.

Ten slotte, met die President se  openingsrede  as  agtergrond,  wil  ek  'n
versoek aan die agb Minister rig om daardie lede van  die  Polisiediens  wat
nie hul verpligtinge en  werksaamhede  verantwoordelik  nakom  nie,  aan  te
spreek en uit te skuif indien nodig sodat  'n  stabiele,  parate  en  trotse
SAPD gebou kan word.  Alle  dank  aan  die  140 000  manskappe  in  blou  en
reserviste  wat  Suid-Afrika  veilig  hou.   Die   Nuwe   NP   steun   beide
begrotingsposte. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Mr J SCHIPPERS: Chairperson, hon members, the late Minister  Steve  Tshwete
dedicated the last two years of his life to the stabilisation  and  decrease
in the crime statistics in South Africa according to the latest figures.  He
laid a good foundation and the new Minister can use this together  with  the
budget tendered today to further bring down the crime  levels  in  order  to
create investor trust and job opportunities.

Through this budget the Government is showing its seriousness to clamp  down
on crime. The budget and the strategic plan of  the  SAPS  over  the  medium
term are already  focused  on  that.  This  will  enable  the  Minister  and
National Commissioner to reach their goals. The budget reflects an  increase
of R5,26 billion over four years with a sound  focus  on  crime  prevention,
43,46%; administration, 28,93%; and  the  criminal  investigation  unit  and
crime intelligence, 20,33%.

Criticism should be expressed when necessary,  but  praise  should  also  be
expressed if successes are achieved. The SAPS  has  compiled  an  impressive
strategic plan for the time period 2002 to 2005. We sincerely hope that  the
many deficiencies and shortcomings in the  organisation  and  administration
of the SAPS will be solved and also that the following  problem  areas  will
be addressed: the  laxity  and  undisciplined  action  of  police  officers;
incorrect procedure with the handling of forensic information and  accidents
and crime scenes; allegations that police officers are  involved  in  crime;
child abuse; rape of defenceless women and children;  gang  money,  kangaroo
courts and vigilantes; the disappearance of dossiers from  police  stations;
the work circumstances of police  officers;  and  the  condition  of  police
stations.

Under the heading, ``Tshwete sou trots gewees het'' the New  NP  released  a
press statement in which the successes  of  the  past  year  are  listed.  I
mention merely a few examples: in Die Burger of February  2,  ``711  vas  in
Opera Tsipa''; in Die Burger of March 17,  ``Grootste  kokaïenvonds  nog  in
die Kaapse hawe gekonfiskeer, in Die Volksblad of April  14,  ``Die  polisie
stel bedrogindikaat aan die kaak''; according to Sapa  on  April  18,  ``695
verdagtes in hegtenis geneem in Johannesburg; according to a  press  release
of June 6, ``Polisiemoorde daal met 31%''. This  indicates  that  there  are
thousands of dedicated officers who are doing their work meticulously.

The  South  African  political  community   places   a   high   premium   on
transparency.  It  is  of  cardinal  importance   that   this   is   applied
continuously by everyone. During the meeting between the police  unions  and
the portfolio committee I realised that they had no  input  in  the  budget.
Still they had to talk about that. This is unfair and unacceptable.

The representatives of  Sapu,  Popcru  and  SA  Technikon  made  informative
recommendations. I want to bring  to  the  council's  attention  a  question
asked by a Popcru member: Why should a police officer receive  promotion  in
order to lay claim to a bigger salary?

In conclusion, with the President's opening address as background,  I  would
like to request the hon the Minister to address those members of the  police
service who are not performing their duties  and  work  responsibly  and  to
move them out so that a stable, prepared and proud SAPS can be built.  Thank
you to the 140 000 personnel in blue and reservists who  are  keeping  South
Africa safe. The New NP supports both Budget Votes.]

Mr  Q  J  KGAUWE:  Chairperson,  Deputy  President,  this  Ministry  has  an
obligation to defend and protect the country's citizens. We  are  duty-bound
to investigate, prosecute and arrest anybody  who  attempts  to  commit  any
criminal activity.

It is almost eight years since  the  democratic  Government  was  installed.
Throughout much  of  the  apartheid  struggle  the  community  was  told  to
denigrate the police. The belief was that the police  were  political  pawns
and instruments of oppression and injustice, and they had to be  challenged.
What is the reality now? The ANC Government has fought  a  battle  to  bring
back the culture of ubuntu and reconcile the community and the  police.  The
kind of police we endorse are those who  will  go  and  gather  evidence  in
respect of crimes under  investigation,  ensure  that  accused  persons  and
witnesses are present at  criminal  trials  and  present  credible  evidence
during trial.

We embrace the  idea  that  sector  policing  will  yield  the  long-awaited
results. It has positive results in the reduction of  crime  as  experienced
to date.

The  allocation  of  resources  in  the  form  of  vehicles  to   previously
disadvantaged communities remains a thorny issue. We must admit  that  there
is no ready solution. A population of  500 000  is  served  by  one  or  two
bakkies. These bakkies are unable to respond promptly to calls to any  crime
scene. When one  calls  the  police  station,  the  response  is,  ``We  are
understaffed and there is no transport.'' For how long must this go on?

Regarding the building of police stations, we must acknowledge  that  police
station buildings  in  disadvantaged  areas  are  dilapidated.  This  has  a
negative impact on the performance of their duty by the  officers  involved.
Toilets are blocked, roofs leak and there are no  telephones,  no  furniture
and no electricity in the rural areas. Do we envisage  a  special  provision
budget to redress the situation in certain police stations  like  Jouberton,
Ikageng, Kanana and Ganyesa?

With regard to police capacity, the actual number of personnel is  123  000.
We appreciate the 7 000-recruit intake for  now.  The  question  that  might
arise now is whether consideration is given to those who  are  resigning  or
retiring from the service. How and when will they be replaced?

Another  dilemma  regarding  these  new  recruits  on  completion  of  their
training, or passing out, is how they are deployed, taking  into  cognisance
that there are no proper buildings and  areas  with  facilities  that  would
accommodate them.

The promotion policy of the SAPS  remains  questionable  and  outdated.  Our
appeal is that it should be revised. The manner in which  it  functions  now
is that, throughout the service,  the  determining  factor  for  one  to  be
promoted is based on the number of years one has been  in  the  service.  My
appeal to the hon the Minister is that he reconsider that position.

The promotion of personnel should be linked  with  capacity,  accountability
and performance output. This will eradicate unwarranted promotions and  will
encourage members to acquire more skills  and  thus  put  more  effort  into
their work.

The aim of  community  policing  was  to  establish  broadly  representative
community policing forums, so as to set up  an  active  partnership  between
the police and the community  through  which  crime,  service  delivery  and
community relations challenges can jointly be resolved.

There  is  no  meaningful  Government  support  to  these  structures,   the
community policing forums. Few CPFs have been able to fulfil their  intended
functions, and they have not been able to garner support from the  community
organisations. We must avoid a white community policing  forum  serving  the
interests of the whites and a black community  policing  forum  serving  the
interests of the blacks. Does the SAPS envisage  a  situation  of  providing
funding to CPF projects?

Regarding volunteerism and the President's  call  for  communities  to  make
themselves available  to  render  their  services  for  free,  there  was  a
positive response from the members of the public.  The  partnership  between
the police and the public was  very  encouraging  and  many  criminals  were
arrested. Certainly, in the townships, residents in every  street  know  who
the criminals are in their midst.

We are told that the work of the corruption unit has been  removed  from  HQ
and redirected to station level. This move exposes those members to  threats
and  intimidation  because  they  will  be  expected  to  arrest  their  own
colleague. The unit's number of officers has  been  decreased  from  250  to
150.

With regard to the public service, we are all aware that currently the  SAPS
are governed under the SA Police Service Act. They fall out  of  the  Public
Service Act, which is not applicable to the SAPS, except for a few members.
Various role-players are wondering whether it would be a move in  the  right
direction for the SAPS to fall under the Public Service Act.  This  is  just
an idea and not a discussion or consideration which will  lead  to  a  final
decision.

With regard to section 49 of the Criminal Procedure Act,  members  might  be
aware  that  there  has  been  a  high  level  of  controversy   about   the
Constitutional Court judgment dealing  with  the  use  of  lethal  force  in
effecting an arrest. The ANC Government has always been  correct.  Everybody
today must accept, implement and support the judgment.

In the judgment  the  court  struck  down  section  49(2)  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Act, a legal provision created  by  the  apartheid  government  to
give the police the maximum freedom to kill people, disguised  as  operating
under the rule. In a democracy police need to uphold standards if  they  are
to win respect and credibility from the public.

Concerning the clarification by the court, a person carrying out  an  arrest
may use as much force as reasonably necessary to overcome resistance to  the
arrest or prevent the person concerned from  fleeing.  The  person  carrying
out the arrest may use force if there  are  reasonable  grounds  to  believe
that either situation pertains. I would say that now is the time to  convict
those with pending charges against them, should the situation warrant it.

I wish to give examples of incidents that damage the image  of  the  police.
We regret the killing of the Diepkloof station  commissioner,  but,  we  are
able to detect  that  there  was  a  dereliction  of  duty,  conspiracy  and
collusion by certain members. An urgent  remedial  punitive  measure  is  to
suspend those officers  who  are  implicated  whilst  the  investigation  is
proceeding. This will serve as a deterrent to those with ulterior motives.

Similarly, the Potchefstroom station director found his domestic worker  ill
and groaning, unable to wake  up  due  to  an  illness  attack.  Instead  of
calling an ambulance to ferry this  ill  patient  to  hospital  for  medical
treatment, he phoned his junior police officers  to  come  and  arrest  that
domestic worker and lock her up in a police cell.

Now, the charge against her was the theft of whiskey  and  being  drunk.  We
call for the immediate suspension of that  officer.  This  is  the  kind  of
situation that one finds oneself confronted with.

Regarding corruption, the SAPS has not  yet  managed  to  exorcise  all  the
demons of the old SA Police. Among  these  are  public  perceptions  of  the
police.

Over 14 600  cases  involving  the  police  were  investigated,  480  police
members arrested and 84 convicted. The latest incident of corruption  within
the SAPS occurred last week in Pietermaritzburg, where  17  police  officers
were arrested on fraud and corruption charges. This clearly  indicates  that
criminal tendencies among the police remain  unacceptably  high.  We  cannot
allow such practices to continue  unabated.  The  victims  are  always  poor
people who are intimidated with arrest should they fail to  pay  the  bribe.
[Applause.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Chairperson, allow me to start off  by  paying  tribute
to the late Minister, Mr Steve Tshwete. Minister Tshwete enjoyed a good  and
robust debate. He was open to positive criticism  and  appreciated  positive
contributions. Most  importantly,  he  cared.  No  problem  brought  to  his
attention was too small.  He  gave  his  personal  attention,  listened  and
followed through. Though one might have differed with him  politically,  one
had to admire his passion  and  compassion.  This  was  illustrated  in  his
comforting family members of the victims of farm murders. The fight  against
crime and the staff of the SAPS were his passion. We will miss him.

To the new Minister, welcome and good luck with a mammoth  task  in  a  very
hot seat. We would like to assure him of our support in  the  fight  against
crime.

A budget is never large enough. We all  experience  that  personally.  After
every raise we are all excited when we receive the news,  and  when  we  get
the first cheque we wonder where the increase disappeared to. The same  goes
for the SAPS budget. In terms of the priorities of Government and the  money
available, there can be no one in  this  House  that  will  argue  that  the
department is not receiving its fair share.  However,  there  will  also  be
none of us that would complain if the National Treasury gave the  department
more.

The question is whether the money is spent in the  most  effective  way.  We
would argue that, with the funding available, SAPS financial  management  is
well thought through. I would, however, like to  focus  on  the  utilisation
and management of the resources available.

The UDM believes that more can be done  with  the  available  resources.  We
would argue that the action should take place at  provincial,  district  and
station commander level. Furthermore, every single police member also has  a
role to play. During visits to police stations, it  becomes  clear  how  the
attitude  of  the  station  commander  and  staff  influences  the  physical
conditions at the station and the success rate of the station  in  combating
crime.

It is often those with less that achieve more. This clearly reflects on  the
morale and motivation of the members at a station. Often it  is  the  morale
that determines the condition of the station, and not the other way  around,
as is so popularly argued. Pride in what they do  in  serving  fellow  South
Africans and combating crime must be a characteristic  of  the  service  and
every one of its members.

Too much money is spent on replacing lost equipment, such as cartridges  and
bulletproof vests. It then becomes easy to claim a shortage while the  truth
is rather that state-owned property has  been  negligently  lost.  The  same
applies to the acquisition and utilisation of the vehicles  in  the  vehicle
fleet. We would urge the SAPS management, the unions  and  every  member  of
the SAPS to embark on an internal drive to turn this situation  around.  The
savings made in this regard can greatly contribute  to  the  acquisition  of
better and technologically more advanced equipment.

The UDM would like to repeat its call in last year's  budget  debate  for  a
new promotion system in the SAPS  that  will  ensure  that  policing  skills
built up over many years are not lost to administration  through  promotion.
We need to make it possible for a good  police  officer  to  keep  on  doing
police work and still receive  promotion.  Here  we  need  to  look  at  and
investigate the British model as a  possible  manner  in  which  to  achieve
this.

The training of SAPS members is of grave concern  to  the  UDM.  We  believe
that training modules are inadequate for the skills needed in South  Africa.
Ongoing training and refresher courses need to  become  a  prerequisite  for
every SAPS member at every level. Just for  example,  physical  fitness  and
firearms training on a monthly basis should be prescribed for every member.

The UDM wants to appeal for a separate and special salary  dispensation  for
SAPS members. Their work and conditions differ from  those  of  other  state
officials. Their salary dispensation should reflect that.

We are concerned about the low conviction rate of cases that  go  to  court.
We believe that this is a matter  that  all  role-players  in  the  criminal
justice system have to give attention to. As far as the SAPS  is  concerned,
we believe that it can contribute to a  higher  conviction  rate  by  giving
attention to the following. The  service  must  ensure  that  experience  is
retained  and  improve  the  technical,  medical  and  documentary  evidence
ability of  SAPS.  SAPS  members  must  be  trained  in  how  to  deal  with
traumatised victims when taking down their statements. The  Bill  of  Rights
requires more skill of our police officers, and it  is  our  duty  to  equip
them accordingly. The interaction and co-operation  between  detectives  and
prosecutors must be even further improved. The  period  between  arrest  and
conviction needs to be shortened dramatically. On average it  is  139  days.
In  this  period  witnesses  forget,  people  move  and,  especially   where
organised crime is concerned, there is room for intimidation.

The decision by Cabinet to release crime figures only once  a  year  is  the
wrong one. This will result in speculation and perceptions  regarding  crime
that the SAPS and the Minister will be  unable  to  address.  It  makes  the
oversight role of Parliament virtually impossible, as it takes away the  one
measurement and early warning system for intervention.

I would like to thank the national management of the SAPS and  every  single
police officer for their commitment. They protect our country's  people  and
assets; they should do so with pride. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, on behalf  of  the  ACDP,  I
first want to congratulate the hon Charles Nqakula  on  his  appointment  as
the Minister of Safety and Security. He has very big shoes  to  fill,  shoes
that were left by the late hon Steve Tshwete. Many people out there who  are
frustrated and impatient because of the very  high  crime  levels  in  their
communities are expectant and looking forward to what the Minister is  going
to do. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: He has big feet too. [Laughter.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Whenever members of the Portfolio Committee on Safety  and
Security are given a presentation on the work of  the  police,  as  happened
yesterday,  we  hear  heartwarming  and  glowing  reports.  We   are   given
statistics and figures that often  do  not  match  the  experiences  on  the
ground.

Among the things we were told yesterday is that  crime  has  stabilised  and
that police want to move from stabilisation  to  crime  reduction.  We  were
also told that the morale in the police is high and that  the  success  rate
in arrests has also risen.

But people correctly expect  more  from  the  police  when  they  hear  such
reports. The fact is that a few  hours  ago,  Cosatu  led  a  protest  march
against both Metrorail and Government because of high crime  levels  on  our
trains. At their press conference yesterday, they highlighted the plight  of
mothers who had lost their children and  loved  ones  to  criminals  on  the
trains. Some of the children were thrown out of the windows  of  fast-moving
trains, leading to their unfortunate deaths.

When the ACDP called for a  permanent  police  presence  on  the  trains  to
ensure the safety of commuters, we were told about  budget  constraints  and
the lack of human resources.  A  lot  of  money  that  should  be  used  for
employing many more police and ensuring that they are  paid  very  well  for
the dangerous work they are doing is wasted on countless social  events  and
cocktail parties that are always taking place in Parliament.

We agree with Cosatu that Government and Metrorail  do  not  take  passenger
safety on trains seriously. How much longer will family members whose  loved
ones use trains and taxis remain unsure as to whether  they  will  see  them
come back home alive? Desperate people  resort  to  vigilantism  to  try  to
stamp out crime in their communities.  They  are  then  arrested  much  more
quickly than the criminals who cause them to resort to  such  tactics.  This
has to be looked at seriously.

In January this year my constituency office was broken into  and  a  lot  of
equipment was stolen. When I was  told  that  no  investigation  was  taking
place, I appealed to the director in charge of the relevant  police  station
for help, but to no avail. I then phoned the SAPS headquarters  in  Pretoria
on a few occasions to get help, but only received empty promises.

Members of the public are always told to come forward  with  information  to
the police. In many cases, if the police do not pass on that information  to
the criminals, then they do not follow up on the leads  they  are  given  by
the public. In the case of my office, the investigating officer did  nothing
when he was told where the stolen computers were.  He  did  not  follow  the
leads that were given to him.

When I again phoned the police headquarters in Pretoria  to  ask  that  this
case be given to another investigating officer, I was told to wait and  that
they would come back to me after the weekend. Now I have  been  waiting  for
about three weeks,  and  all  I  get  from  the  police  headquarters  is  a
deafening silence. I even had to close down my constituency office,  because
the investigating officer told us that he did not think that members  of  my
staff were safe in that office. So we had no choice. For  their  safety,  we
had to move office.

What are the police there for, if not to ensure the  safety  of  members  of
the public, including those who run the constituency offices of  members  of
Parliament? A relevant question to ask is: If members of Parliament  and  of
the Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security get such  poor  service,  how
can we be sure  that  ordinary  members  of  the  public,  particularly  the
poorest of the poor, will  get  good  service  from  them?  How  can  we  be
expected to support the Budget Vote that will not help us  feel  safer  even
in our communities and offices?
This  situation  is  not   only   appalling,   but   it   is   a   disgrace.
[Interjections.] Shut up! [Laughter.] We are told that the success  rate  in
arrests has risen, and yet we do not see that on the ground. If  the  police
do not arrest the criminals who stole  the  computers  from  my  office  and
restore  them,  then  I  will  have  to  make  a  claim  to   the   Pretoria
headquarters. [Applause.]

follows.)

[Mrs D M MOROBI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,  I  am  here  to
introduce a topic regarding sexual child abuse. The second topic will  focus
on domestic violence.

We realise  that  adultery  is  spreading  widely.  Traditionally,  this  is
miraculous, irrespective of a person's colour. It  never  happened  that  an
adult, either male or female, could strip off and show a child  his  or  her
private parts. I am talking about sex. The children  who  are  being  abused
don't even know this thing called sex. They find  themselves  faced  with  a
situation they cannot even explain. Let me give an example: Two  weeks  ago,
a little girl realised,  after  sustaining  an  injury,  that  she  and  her
friends were being sexually abused. This child is six years old.
When I asked the girl what had happened, she told me that when they  reached
the place at which they were raped they were told to put their books on  the
table. Men would emerge from the bedrooms  with  their  heads  covered  with
cloths. These men would then strip them naked and  sleep  on  top  of  their
little bodies. That is how a little six-year-old child  speaks  when  trying
to explain her predicament. She will say  the  men  are  sleeping  on  their
bodies, because they are unable to explain. When satisfied, these men  would
instruct the children to put on their clothes and go home.

We really need to pray hard in order to overcome this problem. I would  like
to challenge everybody in this country who believes in  God,  even  here  in
this House of government, to pray hard because all of them  know  very  well
that God presides over everything. And I am  disappointed  to  realise  that
Rev Meshoe is forgetting that he is a religious  figure.  According  to  our
religion, mine and his, ``everything we do, we do to  the  glory  of  God''.
But I am very disappointed to see him standing here, behaving as  though  he
has forgotten that he is a child of God.]

I wonder whether these rapists are animals. Children  are  raped  by  family
friends, neighbours and relatives. They deserve to be respected and  treated
with dignity. They have the right to be heard, loved,  protected  from  harm
and to have a safe, comfortable and  happy  home.  I  am  calling  upon  all
rapists not to lose touch with reality and to stop behaving like animals.

We cannot compromise our integrity by succumbing to  the  saying  that  ``we
are  a  society  born  out  of  deprivation,  neglect,  deep   poverty   and
unemployment''. This statement does not justify  animal-like  behaviour.  It
is alleged that the sexual abuse  of  children  emanates  from  poverty  and
unemployment, and the myth that having sex  with  a  child  is  a  cure  for
HIV/Aids also contributes. That cannot be condoned.

HIV/Aids is a serious health problem which is compounded  by  ignorance  and
unfair discrimination against persons living  with  HIV/Aids.  It  has  been
perpetuated by the practice of pre-employment testing, denial of  employees'
benefits and dismissal for being HIV-positive. We are aware that it  affects
every workplace. That is why the SA Police Service has made a commitment  to
promote equal and fair treatment of their employees, infected  or  affected.
The purpose of doing this is, amongst  others,  to  create  a  safe  working
environment and to give a support  system  to  those  who  are  infected  or
affected.

There are programmes which were put in place  for  members  of  SAPS  to  be
advised or informed on how to live a safer lifestyle; how not to be  exposed
to infections; how to do voluntary testing, if need  be;  and  how  to  take
extra precautions to curb infections.  This  policy  is  applicable  to  all
employees appointed in terms of the South African Police  Service  Act,  Act
68 of 1995, and the Public Service Act, Act 103 of 1994.

The aim of the Department of Safety and Security is to prevent,  combat  and
investigate crime and protect the inhabitants of South Africa.  Although  it
is evident that the SAPS is successful in reducing the levels  of  crime  in
certain areas - during the public hearings on the sexual abuse  of  children
most presenters mentioned the fact that they  appreciated  the  department's
efforts to curb this horrific and barbaric behaviour - it is not enough.

Some recommended that the SAPS  should  be  efficiently  trained  to  manage
issues of sexual  abuse,  that  there  should  be  a  uniform  approach  and
procedures for investigating at all police  stations  nationally,  and  that
there should be legislation that prohibits the trafficking of people.  There
are programmes put in place by the Department  of  Safety  and  Security  to
prevent and eliminate  sexual  abuse,  for  proper  investigations  and  for
victim and witness support. There are also external programmes initiated  by
CPFs and NGOs.

The Domestic Violence Act  was  put  in  place  to  afford  the  victims  of
domestic violence the highest level of protection from domestic abusers  and
also to enforce, provide and introduce measures to ensure protection and  to
prove that the state is committed to eliminating domestic violence.

Tlhekefetso  ena  ya  malapeng  e  habedi,  le  hoja  bongata  ba  batho  ba
hlekefetswang e le bomme ... [Although people who  are  frequently  harassed
are women, domestic violence is twofold ...]

... for the simple reason that they have been denied  access  to  their  own
rights as persons or human beings for a long time,  hence  their  dependence
on their male partners. Most women  are  still  coming  to  terms  with  the
transformation that is brought by the ANC-led Government.

There are different types of abuses. There is physical, economical,  verbal,
passive and emotional abuse, and a whole range of other abuses,  up  to  the
level of sexual abuse. Some people are raped  by  their  husbands,  friends,
etc. Others are punished by their partners by denying them conjugal rights.

Focus on crime against women  is  high  on  the  agenda.  There  are  25 000
officials who are trained on the Domestic Violence Act. The police are  also
concerned  by  family  violence,  regarding  which  1 021  cases  of  sexual
offences have been finalised and will be submitted to the Cabinet.

An amount of R7 400 210 is allocated to  visible  policing  and  includes  a
multidisciplinary initiative  to  combat  crime  against  women.  A  further
amount of R946 289 is allocated for  specialised  and  visible  policing  to
cater for victims' support and to reduce the levels of violent  crimes.  The
total amount is R8 346 785. This increase to the Vote marks a  milestone  in
the transformation of the SAPS. This will  increase  police  visibility  and
allow the workload to be handled more effectively.

I urge  every  citizen  of  South  Africa,  not  excluding  members  of  the
opposition parties, as well as Moruti Meshoe, to put their trust and  effort
into the victories, because victories are there. They should be part of  the
process and not lose hope, because a hopeless  nation  does  not  value  its
achievement.

Re tshwanela ho tshwarisama mmoho, ho lwantsha kgodumodumo ena. [We have  to
hang on together, to fight this ogre.]

The Nepad health document states:


  This partnership will require patience. Change will not happen overnight.
  We need to work in unison. Like a bicycle, it has a number of  parts  and
  has to be well oiled to move forward. Take away the wheels and the chain,
  and you are stuck. Without the handles, you lose direction, and without a
  rider, you will crash.

There is a solution. People should be part of the process. We are  still  on
track. The ANC supports the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, firstly, I want to respond  to  the  opening
remarks of our hon Minister about the fact that there are so few members  of
the ANC present in the Chamber this afternoon. I want to say to the hon  the
Minister that that shows what the interest and the seriousness  of  the  ANC
is regarding the Police Service and crime, because if it were  important  to
them, they would have been here for this important  debate  on  this  Budget
Vote.

Verlede maand by die Nasionale Persklub in Pretoria  het  die  agb  Minister
die volgende gesê:


  Dit is loutere onsin dat hier meer misdaad is as in lande  soos  Engeland
  en Frankryk.

Of ek en die agb Minister woon nie in dieselfde land nie, òf  ons  moet  hom
verskoon omdat hy 'n nuut aangestelde  Minister  is,  want  volgens  die  SA
Instituut oor Rasse-aangeleenthede se 2001-02 ondersoek  is  die  syfer  vir
moord in Suid-Afrika 55,3 per 100 000,  terwyl  dit  in  Frankryk  3,41  per
100 000 is. Met ander woorde, Suid-Afrika se moordsyfer is 15 keer  meer  as
dié van Frankryk.

Ten opsigte van verkragting is Suid-Afrika  se  syfer  119  per  100 000  en
Frankryk s'n is 13,6 per 100 000. In geval van roof  het  Suid-Afrika  225,7
per 100 000 en Frankryk 162,25 per 100 000.  Ek  kan  verstaan  as  die  agb
Minister sê dit  is  loutere  onsin,  want  hy  word  daagliks  omring  deur
lyfwagte wat sorg dat hy beskerm en beveilig  word,  maar  dit  is  nie  die
geval met die gewone burger op straat nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die agb Minister maak die uitspraak:


  As iemand steel omdat hy honger is, moet dit geklassifiseer  word  as  'n
  noodmisdaad.

Dit is 'n uiters gevaarlike stelling.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die  agb  Minister
skep  die  indruk  dat  daar  versagtende  omstandighede  is   as   diefstal
plaasvind.

Baie diefstal  gaan  gepaard  met  moord,  want  as  ons  net  gaan  kyk  na
plaasmoorde en die uitsprake van die ANC-regering, dan word daar  elke  keer
gesê dat dit gewone misdaad is en gewone diefstal en omdat die  boer  en  sy
vrou op hulle afgekom het, is hulle vermoor. Met ander woorde, diefstal  lei
ook tot moord. Die  Minister  voorkom  nie  misdaad  nie,  maar  deur  sulke
uitlatings moedig hy dit aan.

Wanneer dit kom by plaasaanvalle en moorde, het ons al verlede  jaar  by  sy
voorganger gehoor van die beloftes wat hy aan die boere gemaak het.  Hy  het
gesê daar gaan 30 000 nuwe reserviste aangestel word vir die polisie, om  te
kyk of daar 'n reservis op elke plaas kan wees. Die  agb  Minister  het  toe
gesê:


  Ons het die begroting. Benewens opleiding sal die  reserviste  vuurwapens
  en uniforms kry.

Die geld is dus daar. Ons wil  weet  van  die  agb  Minister:  Waar  is  die
reserviste wat binne 'n jaar op die plase sou wees? Die  geld  is  daar.  Ek
het aan die agb Minister 'n vraag oor plaasmoorde gevra. Op 15  Mei  het  hy
my soos volg geantwoord:


  Die kommissie van ondersoek na die oorsake van die plaasmoorde  is  reeds
  afgehandel.

Maak dit vir ons bekend. Maak dit vir die openbare publiek  bekend  wat  die
oorsake en die motiewe vir plaasmoorde is.  Baie  landbou-organisasies  stel
veiligheidsplanne  beskikbaar  om  ook  in  werking  gestel  te   word,   na
aanleiding van hierdie bevindings van die kommissie. Maak  dit  bekend,  dan
weet ons wat om te doen. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Wat betref die mannekrag van die SAPD, wil ek sommer heel bo  begin.  In  'n
berig in die Beeld van 23 Maart 2002 skryf Christo van  der  Westhuizen  die
volgende:


  Polisiehoof Selebi se dae glo getel.


  Die dae van kommissaris Jackie Selebi, polisiehoof, is glo getel. Daar is
  glo ongelukkigheid oor  sy  herhaaldelike  verklarings  dat  die  Wet  op
  Huishoudelike Geweld nie toegepas kan word  nie.  Volgens  ons  inligting
  word dit oorweeg om Selebi se kontrak oor sowat 5 maande nie  te  hernieu
  nie.

Ek wil die agb Minister iets vra.  Hy  skuld  dit  aan  Suid-Afrika,  as  hy
netnou antwoord, om te sê of hy die kommissaris se kontrak gaan hernieu  vir
die volgende vyf jaar of nie.

Daar  kan  baie  kritiek  wees  teen  die  kommissaris  en  dit  is  ook  'n
kommissaris wat opkom vir sy lede, veral as dit gaan oor artikel 49 van  die
Strafproseswet. Ons het gaan kyk na die uitspraak  van  die  Konstitusionele
Hof en regter Kriegler se uitspraak daaroor. Ek wil vandag vir die  Minister
sê dat daar van lede van die SAPD verwag word om 'n supermens te wees,  want
in breukdele van sekondes moet sulke lede 'n oordeel vel: Mag ek of  mag  ek
nie myself verdedig nie?

In my dorp, Stilfontein, is 'n  polisieman  doodgeskiet  met  sy  eie  wapen
omdat hy gehuiwer het en nie seker was of hy mag skiet nie. Ek sal graag  by
die agb Minister wil hoor  watter  opleiding  daar,  spesifiek  wat  hierdie
aspek betref, vir die lede van die SAPD gegee word.

Sover dit ons Polisiediens betref,  moet  die  Minister  begin  verbykyk  by
regstellende  aksie.  Haal  die  politiek  uit  die  Polisiediens  en   maak
bevorderings prestasiegeoriënteerd. As 'n bepaalde lid  of  'n  bevelvoerder
vir prestasie gelewer  by  sy  stasie  bevordering  kry,  sal  die  Minister
kwaliteitmense kry wat misdaad behoorlik kan bekamp en dan sal ons 'n  beter
Suid-Afrika hê. [Tyd verstreke.]

Mnr D V BLOEM: Pieter, wat weet jy van regstellende aksie?

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Jy weet niks! Ek weet baie meer as jy!  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Last month, at the National Press Club in Pretoria, the  hon  the  Minister
said the following:


  Dit is loutere onsin dat hier meer misdaad is as in lande  soos  Engeland
  en Frankryk.

Either the hon the Minister and I do not live in the  same  country,  or  we
have to excuse him for being a newly appointed Minister,  because  according
to the 2001-02 investigation by the  SA  Institute  of  Race  Relations  the
figure for murder in South Africa is 55,3 per 100 000, whereas in France  it
is 3,41 per 100 000. In other words, South Africa's murder rate is 15  times
that of France!

With regard to rape, South Africa's figure is 119 per 100  000,  while  that
of France is 13,6 per 100 000. As regards robbery, South  Africa  has  225,7
per 100 000 and France 162,25 per 100 000. I can  understand  that  the  hon
the Minister says it is pure nonsense, because every day  he  is  surrounded
by bodyguards who see to it that he is safe and secure, but that is not  the
case with the ordinary citizen out on the street. [Interjections.]

The hon the Minister states:


  As iemand steel omdat hy honger is, moet dit geklassifiseer  word  as  'n
  noodmisdaad.

This is an extremely  dangerous  statement.  [Interjections.]  The  hon  the
Minister  is  creating   the   impression   that   there   are   extenuating
circumstances  when  theft  takes  place.  A  lot  of  theft   takes   place
accompanied by murder, because if we just  look  at  farm  murders  and  the
statements by the ANC Government, then  one  always  hears  that  it  was  a
normal crime and normal theft, and that because  the  farmer  and  his  wife
came upon them, they were murdered. In other  words,  theft  also  leads  to
murder. The Minister is not preventing crime, but  through  such  statements
he is encouraging it.

As regards farm attacks and murders, last year already  we  heard  from  his
predecessor about the promises that he made to the farmers. He said that  30
000 new reservists were going to be appointed to the  police,  in  order  to
see if there could be a reservist on every farm. The hon the  Minister  then
said:


  Ons het die begroting. Benewens opleiding sal die  reserviste  vuurwapens
  en uniforms kry.
So the funds are there. We want to know from the  hon  the  Minister:  Where
are the reservists who were going to be on the  farms  within  a  year?  The
money is there. I asked the hon the Minister a question about  farm  murders
and on 15 May he answered me as follows:


  Die Kommissie van ondersoek na die oorsake van die plaasmoorde  is  reeds
  afgehandel.

Publish it for us. Tell the general public  just  what  the  causes  of  and
motives for farm murders are. Many agricultural  organisations  can  provide
security plans, which can also be implemented arising  from  these  findings
of  the  commission.  Announce  it,  then  we  will   know   what   to   do.
[Interjections.]

As regards SAPS manpower, I would just like to start  from  the  top.  In  a
report in the Beeld of 23 March 2002, Christo van der Westhuizen  writes  as
follows:


  Polisiehoof Selebise dae glo getel.
  Die dae van Kommissaris Jackie Selebi, polisiehoof, is glo getel. Daar is
  glo ongelukkigheid oor sy  herhaarldelike  verklarings  dat  die  wet  op
  huihoudelike geweld nie toegepas kan word nie. Volgens ons inligting word
  dit oorweeg om Selebi se kontrak oor sowat 5 maande nie te hernieu nie.

I want to ask the hon the Minister something. He owes it  to  South  Africa,
when he replies in a moment, to tell us whether he is  going  to  renew  the
Commissioner's contract or not.

There may be a lot of criticism against the Commissioner,  and  he  is  also
someone to stand up for his members, especially when it concerns section  49
of the Criminal Procedure  Act.  We  took  a  look  at  the  ruling  by  the
Constitutional Court and Judge Kriegler's pronouncement  on  the  matter.  I
can tell the Minister today that members of the  SAPS  are  expected  to  be
superhuman, because in a fraction of a second they have to decide: May I  or
may I not defend myself?

In my town, Stilfontein, a policeman was shot  dead  with  his  own  weapon,
because he hesitated and was not sure if he was allowed to  shoot.  I  would
like to know from the hon  the  Minister  what  training  SAPS  members  are
receiving, specifically with regard to this aspect.

As far as our Police Service is concerned,  the  Minister  should  start  to
look past affirmative action. Take politics out of the  Police  Service  and
make promotions performance orientated. If a certain member  or  officer  in
charge is promoted for his performance at his  station,  the  Minister  will
have people of quality who can combat crime properly and then we  will  have
a better South Africa. [Time expired.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Pieter, what do you know about affirmative action?

Mr P J GROENEWALD: You know nothing! I know more than you do!]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairperson, first of  all  I  want  to  pay  tribute  to
members of the SAPS. By all standards our police continue to do  magnificent
work in our country,  which  is  crime-infested  and  needs  an  imaginative
government determined to crush crime, instead  of  making  cheap  propaganda
against those who have long proposed more drastic steps against crime.

In  the  face  of  great  difficulty  the  SAPS  has  penetrated   dangerous
syndicates and crushed many of them. The PAC acknowledges the good  work  by
the ICD for the public. The Ministry has been allocated an adequate  budget.
Police stations must be  provided  with  enough  vehicles.  They  must  have
working telephones, especially  in  the  rural  areas  and  in  the  African
townships.

Our police must be well paid. The  Ministry  of  Safety  and  Security  must
create conditions which make our police feel they are an  important  arm  of
this nation. Good police must find a permanent career in the  SAPS,  instead
of being forced to resign and seek  greener  pastures  elsewhere.  MPs  must
refrain from  criticising  the  National  Commissioner  of  police  and  his
colleagues in public when criticism is called for.

Those who compare crime in this country to other countries do not  help  our
country. Their comparisons sound like the practice of the  former  apartheid
leaders. When Africans complained about apartheid and  colonial  laws  which
oppressed them there, the apartheid rulers used  to  boast  that  they  were
natives or Bantus, who were better off here than the Africans  in  the  rest
of Africa.

The people of this country  do  not  care  what  murderers  and  rapists  do
elsewhere and how many there are. Our people want crime stopped  here.  Full
stop! [Applause.]

The Labour Party in Britain is learning that the hard way. While  its  Prime
Minister Blair was fiddling in the affairs of Zimbabwe,  fighting  President
Mugabe over the land of his ancestors, crime increased  in  the  streets  of
London. The voters therefore have not compared crime  in  their  country  to
that in other countries. They have sharply switched to  a  party  that  they
think would stop crime. Consequently, the Labour Party has lost  4%  of  its
voters and Blair has to work hard to crush crime or be  thrown  out  of  the
government.

Crime is abnormal in a civilised society. Everything must  be  done  in  our
country  to  eliminate  crime.  There  is  no  country  that   can   advance
economically and for the benefit of  its  citizens  when  there  is  rampant
crime. The PAC finds the budget allocation adequate and will  vote  for  it.
We also wish the Minister all success in his new position. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, Minister,  safety  and  security  in  South
Africa have been extensively pressurised by the high crime  rate  throughout
the country. However, the MF is glad to  note  that  the  role-players  have
extended their consent to combat and demolish  crime  completely.  Business,
government, NGOs, policing anticrime forums, night watches  and  the  public
at large are extensively in collaboration to stamp out crime.
We see gang-infested communities forming units to stop gang  activities  and
force illegal activities out of their areas. At school we see  the  adoption
of programmes  and  activities  to  educate  our  youth  on  the  wrongs  of
committing crime. The price payable is the punishment, and  there  are  ways
to become better people  with  better  values  and  which  are  not  to  the
detriment of the community.

The MF, once again, would like to express how  pleased  it  is  to  see  the
unanimous interest in combating crime throughout South  Africa.  The  safety
of our society is the responsibility of all citizens of South Africa.

The MF would also like to grieve the loss of the hon the  Minister  Tshwete,
but  is  confident  of  the  new  Minister's  ability  to  carry   out   the
responsibilities of the department efficiently and effectively. He  has  our
support.

In view of the department's budget  and  its  aim  to  prevent,  combat  and
investigate  crime,  maintain  public  order,   protect   and   secure   the
inhabitants of South Africa and their property and uphold  and  enforce  the
law, it is felt that the budget is never  adequate.  Specific  concentration
and funding needs to be made available  in  connection  with  the  resources
available at police stations, such as vans. At one police station  only  two
vans  were  serviceable.  Similar  problems  were  noted  at  other   police
stations. It is not acceptable that large numbers of  call-ins  and  reports
as a result  of  no  vans  being  available  lead  to  reports  often  being
addressed hours later. This could result in death and more.

The seriousness of this situation is enormous and communities are  at  risk.
At the same time we find  our  SAPS  constantly  being  criticised  for  its
inability to address community needs more efficiently, but it  needs  to  be
noted that effectiveness is minimised by the  unavailability  of  resources.
The MF supports this Budget Vote.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, vergun my om te begin met  'n  persoonlike
ervaring van 'n besoek aan 'n polisiestasie. Sowat 'n maand gelede  moes  ek
'n fotostaat van my ID by die polisiestasie in Pretoria laat  bekragtig.  'n
Netjiese nuwe polisiestasie, en met vriendelike diens  agter  die  toonbank.
Voor die toonbank het ses lede van die  publiek  gestaan.  Vier  beamptes  -
almal in uniform - het ons bedien.

Kliënt   1   het   die   verlies   van   'n   selfoon   gerapporteer.    Die
assuransiemaatskappy vereis 'n dossiernommer voor hulle uitbetaal. Kliënt  2
het haar kar teen 'n paal  gestamp  en  'n  16-bladsye  ongelukverslag  word
ingevul - ook  vir  die  versekering.  Ek  en  andere  moes  dokumente  laat
bekragtig. 'n Ander moes  'n  dokument  laat  beëdig.  Die  laaste  moes  'n
uitklaring kry op 'n voertuig. Die finansiëringsbank het dit vereis.

Wat beteken dit? Vier  mense  in  uniform  staan  die  hele  dag  agter  die
toonbank. In werklikheid is hulle ``glorified klerke''  wat  die  werk  doen
vir versekeringsmaatskappye  en  ander  instansies,  en  buite  baljaar  die
misdadigers.  Dit  kan  nie  so  aangaan  nie.  Daardie   vier   vriendelike
uniformmense se bydrae tot veiligheid daardie dag is zero. Die  AEB  versoek
die Minister  om  dringend  die  aanstelling  van  siviele  persone  in  die
polisiediens te implementeer. Goedopgeleide lede van die mag is nie daar  om
as klerke diens te doen nie. Dit is nie die plig van die staat  om  te  dans
op die maat van die musiek van  besighede  soos  assuransiemaatskappye  nie.
Daar moet dringend met hulle onderhandel  word  om  hierdie  tipe  diens  te
privatiseer  of  minstens  te  laat  vereenvoudig.   Duisende   lêers   word
oopgemaak, net om 'n dossiernommer op die  eisvorm  te  kan  plaas  en  niks
verder nie.

Die pleidooi van die AEB is eenvoudig: Sigbare polisiëring - ``bobby on  the
beat''. Wend ons goedopgeleide lede aan teen misdaad elke  oomblik  van  die
dag. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairman, allow me to start with my personal experience  of
a visit to a police station. About a month ago I had to have a photocopy  of
my ID ratified at the police station in Pretoria. It is a  neat  new  police
station with friendly service behind the counter. In front  of  the  counter
stood six members of the public. Four officers - all in uniform  -  assisted
us.

Client 1 reported the loss of a cellphone. The insurance company required  a
case number before paying out. Client 2 bumped her car against a pole and  a
16-page accident report was completed - also for insurance purposes.  Others
and I had to have documents ratified. Another had a document that needed  to
be signed. The latter had to obtain vehicle clearance.  The  financing  bank
required it.

What does this mean? Four people in uniform stood  behind  the  counter  the
whole day.  In  reality  they  are  glorified  clerks  doing  the  work  for
insurance companies and  other  institutions,  while  the  criminals  frolic
outside. This cannot continue.  The  contribution  of  those  four  friendly
people in uniform to  safety  that  day  was  zero.  The  AEB  requests  the
Minister urgently to introduce the  appointment  of  civil  persons  to  the
police service. Well-trained members of the service are not  there  to  work
as clerks. It is not the  duty  of  the  state  to  dance  to  the  tune  of
businesses such  as  insurance  companies.  Urgent  negotiations  with  them
should take place to privatise this type of service or at least to  simplify
it. Thousands of files are opened only to put a case number on a claim  form
and nothing else.

The plea of the AEB is simple: Visible policing - bobby  on  the  beat.  Use
our well-trained members against crime every moment of the day.]

We know that the hon the Minister's seat is a hot  one.  The  responsibility
for safety and security in a country like South Africa is not an easy  task.
We wish him all the best in performing his duties. The AEB has  to  point  a
finger at three indicators of perhaps not so good a  start:  the  Minister's
views on crime statistics; his statement about  a  sympathetic  approach  to
crime that is allegedly caused by poverty; and maybe  a  preoccupation  with
the transformation of the SAPS.

Die Minister se stelling dat misdaadstatistiek onder die kombers gehou  moet
word, en net een keer per jaar, indien nodig, bekendgestel word,  omdat  dit
mense negatief instel, gaan nie  op  nie.  Dit  beloof  niks  goeds  vir  'n
sistematiese en volhoubare aanslag teen  misdaad  nie.  Statistiek  gee  die
ware feite van wat op grondvlak aangaan en is 'n onmisbare  vertrekpunt  vir
enige grondige aanslag teen misdaad.

'n Minister van veiligheid en sekuriteit wat  volstruispolitiek  toepas,  en
die werklikheid van harde syfers wil ontken, sal nie  daarin  slaag  om  die
misdaadgeteisterde werklikheid op grondvlak effektief  aan  te  spreek  nie.
Dit is nie net die statistiese gegewens wat mense negatief maak nie. Dit  is
die ervaring. Dit is 'n vriend, 'n kind  of  'n  familielid  wat  aangerand,
verkrag of vermoor word.

Net so verontrustend is klaarblyklike simpatie wat  die  Minister  uitspreek
met misdaad wat dalk uit armoede uit gebore is. Die AEB  stem  saam  dat  'n
verhoging in lewenstandaard en veral werkskepping misdaad sal  laat  afneem,
maar dit is nie  'n  versagting  vir  die  pleeg  van  misdaad  nie.  As  in
aanmerking geneem word dat 'n groot persentasie van misdaad  in  Suid-Afrika
met die uiterste vorm van  geweld  gepaard  gaan,  klink  die  stelling  nie
heeltemal  waar   nie.   Van   die   Minister   word   verwag   om   misdaad
ongekwalifiseerd te veroordeel en nie om verskonings vir misdadigers uit  te
dink nie.

Op hierdie wyse stuur  'n  mens  'n  aanloklike  sein  uit  vir  voornemende
misdadigers.

Die Minister het hierdie week aan  die  portefeulje  komitee  gesê  dat  dit
noodsaaklik is vir die morele eenheid in  die  polisie  dat  die  diens  die
demografiese samestelling van Suid-Afrika weerspieël, en  dat  transformasie
dus een van die diens se prioriteite is. Die Minister het gemeld  dat  swart
personeel reeds 76% van die mag uitmaak, maar hy wil die  weerspieëling  van
die bevolkingsamestelling op elke posvlak forseer.

Die persentasie swartes op topbestuursvlak  is  44%,  teenoor  die  11%  van
1995; en op junior vlak is dit 46%, teenoor die 14% van  sewe  jaar  gelede.
Die Minister wil nou ten alle koste die transformasie op  middelbestuursvlak
ook afdwing. Dit veroorsaak 'n probleem, want dit  beteken  in  effek:  geen
bevordering vir wit polisiebeamptes op juniorbestuursvlak nie, want daar  is
'n plafon. Dit frustreer 'n belangrike deel van die  mag,  en  dit  lei  tot
frustrasie en tot 'n uitvloei van kundigheid en ervaring. Intussen  lag  die
misdadigers.  Terwyl  die  Minister  transformeer,  is  hulle  besig  om  te
triomfeer.

Suid-Afrika se eerste prioriteit is nie 'n getransformeerde polisiemag  nie,
maar 'n gedetermineerde, effektiewe polisiemag. 'n  Mens  kan  nie  met  jou
tweede span teen misdadigers op die veld draf nie, of moet ons  ten  opsigte
van ons veiligheidsdienste ook bereid wees om  vir  drie  jaar  te  verloor,
soos wat President Mbeki  van  ons  sportspanne  gesê  het,  ter  wille  van
transformasie?

Misdaadsindikate is nie bekommerd oor transformasie nie.  Hulle  span  hulle
volle potensiaal in. Meriete, en meriete alleen moet die maatstaf  wees  vir
aanstellings en bevorderings in die polisiemag, anders voer ons  'n  verlore
stryd. Die publiek gee nie om watter kleur die polisiebeampte is  wat  hulle
beveilig  nie,  maar  wel  wat  die   getal   suksesvolle   arrestasies   en
skuldigbevindings op sy rekord is.

Daar het nog nie veel gekom van die beloftes oor  die  totale  aanslag  teen
plaasmoorde nie. Die Minister het  tot  nou  toe  daaroor  geswyg.  Kan  die
Minister aan hierdie Huis verslag lewer oor die addisionele ontplooiing  van
personeel in landelike gebiede, die  werwing  van  reserviste  en  die  pro-
aktiewe ontmagtiging van plaasmoordsindikate deur  verskerpte  intelligensie
optrede? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The Minister's statement that crime statistics should be kept  under  wraps
and only be published once a year, if necessary, because it  affects  people
negatively, is unacceptable. This does not in the least  augur  well  for  a
systematic and sustainable onslaught on crime. Statistics give one the  true
facts of what is happening at grassroots level and are an  undeniable  point
of departure for any thorough onslaught against crime.

A Minister of safety and security who plays ostrich politics, and  wants  to
deny the reality of true figures, will not succeed  in  effectively  dealing
with  the  crime-riddled  reality  at  grassroots  level.  It  is  not  just
statistics that inspire people negatively. It is the  experience.  It  is  a
friend, a child or a member  of  the  family  who  is  assaulted,  raped  or
murdered.

Similarly disconcerting is the apparent sympathy of the Minister with  crime
that could perhaps  be  attributed  to  poverty.  The  AEB  agrees  that  an
increase in the standard of living and, job  creation  in  particular,  will
cause crime to decline, but this is no mitigation in committing a crime.  If
one takes into consideration that a  major  percentage  of  crime  in  South
Africa is associated with extreme violence, then  that  statement  does  not
ring entirely true. The  Minister  is  expected  to  condemn  crime  without
conditions and not to think of excuses for criminals.  In  this  manner  one
sends an attractive signal to prospective criminals.

The Minister told the portfolio committee this week that  it  was  essential
for  the  moral  unity  in  the  police  that  the  service  reflected   the
demographic  composition  of  South  Africa,  and  that  transformation  was
therefore one of the priorities of the service. The Minister mentioned  that
75% of the service already comprised black staff, but  he  wanted  to  force
the reflection of the composition of the population at  the  level  of  each
post.

The percentage of blacks at the top management level is 44%, as  opposed  to
11% in 1995; and at the junior level it is 46%,  as  opposed  to  14%  seven
years  ago.  The  Minister  wants  to  enforce  transformation   at   middle
management level at all costs. This causes a problem,  because  it  actually
means: No promotion for white  police  officers  at  the  junior  management
level, as there is a ceiling. This  frustrates  an  important  part  of  the
service, and causes frustration and a drainage of expertise and  experience.
In  the  meanwhile  the  criminals  are  laughing.  While  the  Minister  is
transforming, they are triumphing.

South Africa's first priority is not a transformed  police  service,  but  a
determined, effective police service. One cannot take to the  field  against
criminals with one's second team, or should we also be prepared to lose  for
three years, as President Mbeki said with regard to our  sports  teams,  for
the sake of transformation as far as our security services are concerned?

Crime syndicates are not concerned  about  transformation.  They  use  their
full  potential.  Merit,  and  merit  alone,  must  be  the  yardstick   for
appointments and promotions in the police service, or we are  engaged  in  a
lost struggle. The public does not care what colour the  police  officer  is
who ensures their safety, but they do care about the  number  of  successful
arrests and convictions on his record.

Not much has come of the promises concerning  the  total  onslaught  against
farm murders. The Minister has as  yet  been  silent  about  it.  Could  the
Minister report to this House with regard to the  additional  deployment  of
staff  in   rural   areas,   recruitment   of   reservists   and   proactive
disempowerment  of  farm  murder  syndicates   by   means   of   intensified
intelligence action?]

I conclude by saying that the AEB calls on the hon the  Minister  to  forget
all the sideshows and political agendas, leave ideology behind  and  do  the
job in the most effective manner  possible.  Secondly,  he  should  get  the
criminals behind bars and make it hard,  if  not  impossible,  for  them  to
embark on new adventures, and then we will fully support him.

[Ms M A MOLEBATSI: Chairperson, the Minister, and the hon  members  of  this

the SABC in Mabopane, I was asked about who should take the position of  the

he or she will be there to fit the big shoes of Mr Steve Tshwete.

Today I am honoured to stand here and say it again  that  it  is  true  that

We see him. We hear him. Minister Nqakula has already proved himself in  the

This presentation is going to look at the private security industry and  the
municipal police within the context of the safety and security field.  Prior
to the creation of the first modern police force in London in 1929,  private
security was a common form of policing  and  social  control.  This  changed
with the advent of industrialisation and urbanisation,  and  the  growth  of
the modern state. By the 1960s public police had  monopolised  control  over
security and crime prevention in virtually all countries.

In the early 1970s the private security  industry  began  to  re-emerge  and
expanded rapidly over the following two decades. By the  end  of  the  1980s
private security had become a lucrative  business,  with  many  corporations
relying more on contracted-out or in-house security than on the  police  for
protection.

The South African private security industry has a number of unique  features
because of the political context in which the industry developed. In  Europe
and the United States the security industry's expansion  in  the  1970s  and
early 1980s occurred without any real input or assistance  from  the  state.
This was not the case in South Africa.

In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s the  former  members  of  the  SA
Police withdrew from many policing  duties  to  concentrate  on  maintaining
political control. The government encouraged the private  security  industry
to fill the gap left by the police's shifted priorities.

The government also assisted  the  industry  by  providing  mechanisms  with
which the industry could link up, formally and informally,  with  the  state
security apparatus. At the formal level  the  state  used  private  security
companies to guard strategic installations.

In 1980 the National Key Points Act was  passed.  The  Act  granted  greater
powers to private security guards who were tasked  with  guarding  strategic
installations, including full powers of arrest, search and seizure. In  1992
the then Commissioner of Police, Gen Johan van  der  Merwe,  considered  the
creation of a permanent secretariat consisting of the SA Police and  private
security industry representatives.

During the 1990s large monopolies  developed  within  the  private  security
industry. It also became one  of  the  fastest  growing  industries  in  the
country, with almost 5 000 security  businesses,  a  workforce  of  200  000
employees and an estimated turnover of R12 billion a year.

Simultaneously, many small, fly-by-night type  of  security  companies  that
provided cheap, substandard service joined the industry, thereby  tarnishing
the image and reputation of the industry as a whole. It  was  believed  that
through proper legislation, the likelihood of misconduct by members  of  the
security industry violating or threatening  the  public  interest  could  be
lowered significantly.

With the passing of the Security Officers Amendment Act of 1996,  Parliament
expressed a clear intent that regulatory  reform  of  the  private  security
industry was necessary. It was  clear  that  the  existing  Act  had  become
outdated, especially with the change in the nature of the industry.

There were also concerns that the industry possibly contained many  elements
that had the potential to engage in abuses. Given the nature  of  activities
conducted by some members of the industry, not to mention  the  implications
of such abuse for the security of the state, the need for the regulation  of
the security industry was  universally  accepted  by  the  majority  of  the
stakeholders, not only within the industry but also in the public sector.  A
question  arose  as  to  the  appropriate  or  suitable  vehicle  for   such
regulation.

Die nodigheid vir die regulering van die  sekuriteitsbedryf  is  deur  almal
aanvaar, nie net deur die  sekerheidsbedryf  nie,  maar  ook  deur  die  wye
publiek. Die vraag is nou watter liggaam toepaslik is om hierdie  regulasies
te bestuur of toe te pas. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The need to regulate the security industry has been accepted  by  everyone,
not only by the security industry itself, but also by the public  at  large.
The question now remains which  body  would  be  appropriate  to  manage  or
enforce such regulations.]

The new Private Security Industry Regulation Act  of  2001  makes  provision
for  the  establishment  of  the  Private   Security   Industry   Regulatory
Authority, replacing the existing Security  Officers  Interim  Board.  Thus,
the envisaged regulatory authority will, henceforth, become the vehicle  for
such regulation.

The  objective  of  regulating  the  industry  is  to  ensure,  first,   the
protection of public interest and the interest of the state; Second  that  a
proper, quality service is rendered to the consumer; third,  the  protection
of the rights of employee  security  officers;  fourth,  the  promotion  and
protection of the status of the occupation of security officer;  fifth,  the
collection of accurate information on security  officers  and  the  security
industry in general; and, sixth, a better life for all.

The Act also covered other security services,  such  as  in-house  security,
car-watchers, electronic security and private  intelligence,  provided  they
were registered. Properly regulated private security companies will  enhance
and strengthen the capacity of the security sector and ensure protection  of
property and persons without endangering public safety in  a  country  where
crime has become a lucrative enterprise.

The term ``municipal police''  still  has  negative  connotations  for  many
South Africans, given that it was first used to describe the poorly  trained
and  often  violent  policemen  deployed  in  townships  by  the   apartheid
government in the 1980s. Other than their name, these policemen had  nothing
in common with today's municipal police.

The municipal police, amounting to 14 000  by  the  late  1980s,  were  used
primarily to guard government installations in townships. They often  gained
a reputation for excessive and inappropriate use of violence, often  arising
from drunken behaviour, ill-discipline and personal vendettas.
Although the  country's  final  Constitution  indicates  that  the  security
services of the country would include only a single  police  service,  thus,
by definition, excluding a multiplicity of police services, a  later  clause
states  that  national  legislation  must  provide  a  framework   for   the
establishment, powers, functions and control of municipal  police  services.
Chapter 12 of the South African Police Service Act makes provision  for  the
establishment of municipal and metropolitan police services.

I now come to challenges. They are, first, to clarify the role  and  mandate
of the municipal police in relation to crime  prevention  and  co-ordination
within  the  Police  Service;  second,  balancing  enforcement   and   crime
prevention activities; third transforming the  organisational  culture  from
specialised enforcement  to  more  general  community  policing  approaches;
fourth, meeting public expectations; fifth,  maintaining  standards;  sixth,
defining the conditions of  service  for  municipal  police  officers;  and,
seventh, the effective enforcement of by-laws.
Before I conclude,  let  me  invite  the  hon  Groenewald  to  come  to  the
portfolio committee ...

Mr P J GROENEWALD: If you invite me, I will.

Ms M A MOLEBATSI: ... so that the next time he stands here  he  speaks  from
an informed position.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Go tell that to your chairperson.

[Ms M A MOLEBATSI: Chairperson, to reduce crime in general  in  our  country
is to say to the late Minister Steve Tshwete: ``Rest  in  peace!''  that  is
better  than  the  rest.  In  conclusion  the  ANC  accepts   this   budget.
[Applause.]]

Mnr E T FERREIRA: Mnr die Voorsitter, die IVP wil  sy  waardering  uitspreek
vir die erns  waarmee  die  Regering  die  afgelope  jaar  of  twee  hierdie
departement benader. Ons is baie trots  op  die  duidelike  verbetering  wat
daar te bespeur is by die SA Polisiediens. Dit sal eenvoudig  oneerlik  wees
om anders te beweer. In die middel tot laat 1990s was  ons  Polisiediens  se
toekoms duister. Misdaad het eenvoudig net toegeneem, en  dit  het  geensins
gelyk of die polisie hond haarafmaak  nie.  Die  moraal  was  laag,  en  die
afwesigheidsyfer was 'n allemintige 30%.

Die ministerie en die polisietopbestuur moet baie  krediet  gegee  word  vir
die wyse waarop  hulle  dinge  omgeswaai  het.  Misdaadstatistieke  het  die
afgelope tyd gestabiliseer,  en  in  party  gevalle  selfs  gedaal.  Daarmee
probeer ons nie sê dat misdaad onder beheer is nie, alles behalwe.  Dit  het
gestabiliseer op heeltemal onaanvaarbaar hoë vlakke. Die  styging  is  egter
gestuit, en dit wil voorkom asof ons die draaipunt bereik het.  Die  IVP  is
vol vertroue dat ons binne die volgende paar jaar 'n afname in  misdaad  kan
sien.
Die betekenisvolle vermindering van misdaad sal natuurlik net 'n  droom  bly
indien    werkloosheid    nie    verminder    deur    die    loodsing    van
werkskeppingsprogramme nie. Dít is egter 'n ekonomiese  faktor  waaroor  ons
Polisiediens nie beheer het  nie,  hoewel  dit  altyd  die  lewe  vir  hulle
moeilik sal maak.

Die moraal in die diens  is  aansienlik  beter.  Dit  is  duidelik  uit  die
afwesigheidsyfer wat afgekom het tot onder 10%.

Die situasie met  polisievoertuie  wat  oud  en  gedaan  is,  wat  baie  hoë
kilometerlesings het, blyk ook te verbeter. Alhoewel  die  polisiediens  nie
noodwendig meer voertuie as 'n jaar gelede het nie, is met  die  bedrag  wat
die Regering bewillig het vir nuwe voertuie,  baie  ou  voertuie  met  nuwes
vervang en ons kan aanvaar dat die  gemiddelde  kilometerlesing  waarskynlik
darem nou al laer is as die 160 000km plus van 'n jaar  of  so  gelede.  Ons
wil net 'n ernstige beroep doen op die leierskap  van  die  polisiediens  op
provinsiale vlak om die geld wat vir hulle gegee  word  vir  nuwe  voertuie,
oordeelkundig te gebruik. Ons aanvaar dat 'n mens soveel  as  moontlik  nuwe
voertuie wil aankoop om  die  voertuiggetalle  te  verhoog,  maar  ons  sien
heeltemal  te  veel  klein  1300-voertuie  in  afgeleë  bergagtige  terrein,
waarvoor hulle doodeenvoudig nie gepas is nie.

Soos wat ons polisiemanne en -vroue se werk  al  hoe  gevaarliker  word,  is
daar die afgelope paar jaar baie gepraat oor  koeëlvaste  baadjies  vir  die
lede. Die betrokke debat het effens stil geword, moontlik en hopelik is  dit
so  dat  alle  funksionele  polisiepersoneel  uitgereik  is  met  koeëlvaste
baadjies. Ek verneem graag van die Minister of dit wel die geval is.

'n Kwessie wat ek weet waarvoor sommige lede van topbestuur  hulle  gruwelik
vererg wanneer mens daaroor praat,  is  die  kwessie  van  ewewigtigheid  en
onpartydigheid van ons polisiediens. Die  paar  ouens  wat  hulle  weer  wil
vererg oor dié onderwerp, moet dit dan maar doen. Daar is genoeg rokies  oor
hierdie kwessie om 'n mens te laat glo dat daar êrens dalk 'n  vuurtjie  is.
Die leier van 'n politieke party het die naweek beweer dat  die  polisie  in
Kaapstad nie so gretig is om ernstige sake te  ondersoek  wat  gepleeg  word
deur lede van die regerende party nie. 'n Mens se  eerste  reaksie  hier  is
natuurlik dat dit waarskynlik goedkoop politiek is.

Wat ons egter bekommer is dat ons in die IVP  al  soortgelyke  ondervindings
in KwaZulu-Natal gehad het. Ons wonder nog steeds wat van  die  Sekonde-saak
geword het.  Ons  weet  dat  die  polisie  natuurlik  somtyds  sake  deeglik
ondersoek en dan is die kantore van die staatsaanklaer traag  met  die  sake
en blameer dan gerieflikheidshalwe  vir  die  polisie  vir  swak  ondersoek;
veral as dit nie vir hulle gerieflik of polities korrek is om  met  'n  saak
voort te gaan nie. Hoe dit ookal sy, ons doen 'n beroep op ons  polisiediens
om te alle tye onpartydig op te tree. Misdaad is misdaad, maak nie saak  wie
dit pleeg nie. As dit mens se base is wat jou betaal en die  misdaad  pleeg,
dan word hulle steeds gearresteer. Almal se misdaad is ewe erg. Geen  gunste
moet gedoen word nie. Die polisie moet net  eenvoudig  die  werk  reg  doen.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr E T FERREIRA:  Mr  Chairperson,  the  IFP  would  like  to  express  its
appreciation for the seriousness with which the  Government  has  approached
these two departments during the past year or two. We are very proud of  the
clear improvement which can be seen in  the  SA  Police  Service.  It  would
simply be dishonest to allege otherwise.  In  the  mid  to  late  1990s  our
Police Service's future was bleak. Crime was simply on the increase, and  it
did not look as if the police were making any headway  at  all.  The  morale
was low and the absentee rate was a huge 30%.

The Ministry and the police top management must be given  a  great  deal  of
credit for the manner in which they  turned  things  around.  Crime  figures
have stabilised recently, and in some cases even dropped.  By  that  we  are
not trying to say  that  crime  is  under  control,  anything  but.  It  has
stabilised at entirely unacceptably high levels. However, the  increase  has
been halted, and it would appear that we have  reached  the  turning  point.
The IFP is full of confidence that we can see a reduction  in  crime  within
the next few years.

The meaningful reduction in crime will naturally  remain  only  a  dream  if
unemployment  is  not  reduced  through  the  launching  of   job   creation
programmes. However, this is an economic factor  which  our  Police  Service
does not have control over, although it will always make life difficult  for
them.

The morale in the service is significantly better. This is  clear  from  the
absentee rate which has come down to below 10%. The  situation  with  police
vehicles which are old and worn out and have very high  kilometre  readings,
also  seems  to  be  improving.  Although  the  Police  Service   does   not
necessarily have more vehicles than a year ago, using the amount  which  the
Government voted for new vehicles, many  old  vehicles  have  been  replaced
with new ones and we can accept that the average kilometre  reading  is  now
probably lower than the more than
160 000km of a year or so ago. We would just like to make an  urgent  appeal
to the leadership of the Police Service  at  provincial  level  to  use  the
money which is given to them for new vehicles wisely.  We  accept  that  one
wants to purchase as many new  vehicles  as  possible  to  increase  vehicle
numbers,  but  we  see  far  too  many  small  1300  vehicles  in   isolated
mountainous terrain, for which they are simply not suitable.

As the work of our policemen and women becomes increasingly dangerous,  much
has been said over the past  two  years  about  bulletproof  vests  for  the
members. This particular debate has quietened down  slightly;  possibly  and
hopefully all functional police staff  have  been  issued  with  bulletproof
vests. I would like to hear from the Minister if this is indeed the case.

An issue about which I know some members of top management get very  annoyed
when one talks about it, is the issue of balance  and  impartiality  of  our
Police Service. The few people who want to  get  annoyed  about  this  topic
again must simply do so. There is  enough  smoke  regarding  this  issue  to
cause one to believe that there is perhaps a fire somewhere. The  leader  of
a political party alleged this weekend that the police in Cape Town are  not
so keen to investigate serious cases committed by members of  the  governing
party. One's first reaction here is naturally that this  is  probably  cheap
politics.

However,  what  concerns  us  is  that  we  in  the  IFP  have  had  similar
experiences in KwaZulu-Natal. We are still wondering what has become of  the
Sekonde case. Naturally, we  know  that  sometimes  the  police  investigate
cases thoroughly and then the offices of the public prosecutor are  slow  in
dealing with the case and  then  conveniently  blame  the  police  for  poor
investigation, particularly if it is not convenient or  politically  correct
for them to proceed with the case. Whatever the case may be,  we  appeal  to
our Police Service to act impartially at all times. Crime is crime, it  does
not matter who commits it. If it is one's bosses who pay you and who  commit
the crime, then they will still be arrested.  Everyone's  crime  is  equally
bad. No favours must be done. The police must simply do the job properly.]

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister en kollegas, ek  wil
graag vir die agb Minister sê dat ons boere in  Suid-Afrika  het  waardering
vir die hoë persentasie arrestasies  na  plaasaanvalle.  Daar  is  vanmiddag
baie melding gemaak van knelpunte in ons  polisiemag  en  ek  wil  graag  my
ondersteuning daarby voeg.

In die strategiese dokument vir die landbou, soos deur  die  President  self
geïnisieer, word die landbou uitgelig as dié  sektor  in  ons  ekonomie  vir
voedselsekuriteit en werkskepping. Om bogenoemde doelwitte te  bereik,  word
veiligheid en sekuriteit  in  die  landbou  baie  hoog  geag.  Agri  SA,  'n
mederolspeler in die President se strategiese  dokument,  ag  veiligheid  op
plase so belangrik dat hy die Agri Securitas-trustfonds  tot  stand  gebring
het. Dit is so eenvoudig: Geen boere, geen plase en geen  kos  nie.  Dit  is
hoe belangrik veiligheid op plase vir Suid-Afrika moet wees.

Kommersiële boere het ook 'n  verantwoordelikheid  teenoor  plaasveiligheid.
Groeiende vertroue vind plaas in Agri SA se leiers.  Dit  is  belangrik  vir
die doelwitte wat ons het.  Boere  aanvaar  grondhervorming  en  die  sukses
daarvan kan 'n demper plaas op politiek geïnspireerde plaasaanvalle.

Die SAPD en die Nasionale Weermag is die hart vir sukses van  veiligheid  op
plase.  Plaasaanvalle  het  afgeneem  in   die   Vrystaat.   Die   nasionale
Kommissaris van Polisie skryf dit toe aan samewerking tussen  boerekommandos
en die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie. Dit is mos die resep.  Dit  is  tragies  dat
die weermag aan die Lesothogrens onttrek is. Hoe kan dit?

Die kommissaris wys daarop dat vonnisse gebruik  is  om  misdadigers  af  te
skrik.  Dit   moet   asseblief   bevorder   word.   Tekortkominge   in   ons
strafregstelsel het die teenoorgestelde uitwerking.  Woordvoerders  van  die
Regering en agb  lede  van  hierdie  Raad  maak  hulself  soms  skuldig  aan
haatspraak en dit vir politieke gewin of persoonlike gewildheid.  Min  besef
ons dat boere se lewens daardeur in gevaar gestel word.
Dit is elkeen van ons  se  plig  om  hard  aan  beter  gesindhede  te  werk.
Negatiewe optrede dra by tot geweld teen onskuldige mense. Veediefstal  tref
alle boere uiters nadelig. Dit geld  ook  vir  klein-  en  opkomende  boere.
Veediefstal het 'n groot finansiële impak.  Mannekrag  en  toerustingtekorte
kortwiek ons veiligheidsmagte. Hier is 'n geleentheid  om  spesialisloopbane
te skep wat 'n positiewe uitwerking op ons land se ekonomie sal hê.

As Vrystater wil ek 'n paar sake oor die Lesothogrens onder die Minister  se
aandag bring. So 'n grens het baie spesifieke  veiligheidsprobleme.  Ek  wil
die Minister verwys na gister se  berig  in  Die  Volksblad.  'n  Vrystaatse
grensboer pleit dat die  Regering  hulle  nie  moet  vergeet  nie.  Vier-en-
veertig duur stoetramme verdwyn in die nag en dit kom neer op meer  as  R100
000 se skade. As ons ons salaris vir 'n jaar verloor en ons  moet  van  iets
anders bly leef in hierdie Raad, hoeveel mense sal nog  volgende  maand  nog
hier sit? Dit gebeur met ons boere. Wat sou die oplossing wees?

Moet ons Buitelandse Sake betrek om goeie betrekkinge te bewerkstellig?  Ons
moet verhoudingskomitees op die been kry. Daar  is  baie  gevalle  waar  die
verhoudings nie reg is nie. Ons is skuldig aan  beide  kante.  Die  grenspad
moet herbou en gebruik word. 'n Peloton moet  op  plase  gestasioneer  word.
Drade moet gepatrolleer word. Dit  word  in  geheel  afgesteel.  Die  indruk
bestaan dat die SAPD nie in beheer is nie. Na behore is  Suid-Afrikaners  in
Lesotho gevang en na 'n jaar is hulle laat gaan. Wat sê dit vir  ons  boere?
Ons kan dit nie so los ten koste van ons boere nie.  Gewone  veediefstalsake
word   swak   ondersoek.   Die   Minister   kan   gerus   die    persentasie
skuldigbevindings in veediefstalsake ondersoek. Dit  is  skrikwekkend  laag.
Die veediefstaleenhede ondersoek nie meer diefstalsake  van  minder  as  vyf
diere nie. Hierdie is  'n  spesialiteitsveld.  Ons  het  nie  by  ons  Suid-
Afrikaanse  polisiestasies  spesialiste  om  hierdie  werk  te  verrig  nie.
Veediefstal beduiwel verhoudings.

Die agb Minister moet asseblief simpatiek wees met  valhekke.  Dit  is  duur
goed en daarom het hulle geldelike hulp.  In  sekere  gebiede  verrig  hulle
belangrike funksies. Ons moet die geweldskultuur aanspreek. Ons moet  respek
vir lewe terugbring. Dit moet 'n gesamentlike poging wees. Ons moet van  ons
swart perswese gebruik maak. Hulle invloed strek ver. Ons  mense  moet  leer
om aan protokol vir toegang  tot  ons  plase  te  voldoen.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Mr Chairman, hon Minister  and  colleagues,  I  would
like to say to the hon  the  Minister  that  our  farmers  in  South  Africa
appreciate the high percentage of  arrests  after  attacks  on  farms.  This
afternoon a lot was said about problem areas in our  police  service  and  I
would like to add my support to this point.

In the strategic document for agriculture, as  initiated  by  the  President
himself, agriculture is singled out as the primary  sector  in  our  economy
that is responsible for food security and job creation. In order to  achieve
the above-mentioned objectives,  safety  and  security  in  agriculture  are
regarded as being of the utmost importance. AgriSA, a fellow role-player  in
the President's strategic document, regards  safety  on  farms  as  of  such
importance that it established the  Agri  Security  Trust  Fund.  It  is  so
simple: No farmers, no farms and no food. This is how  important  safety  on
farms should be to South Africa.

Commercial farmers also have a responsibility  towards  security  on  farms.
There is increasing confidence in the leaders of  AgriSA.  It  is  important
for our objectives. Farmers accept the land reform process and  its  success
may suppress politically inspired attacks on farms.

The SAPS and the national Defence Force are at the core of  the  success  of
achieving safety in farms. Attacks on  farms  have  decreased  in  the  Free
State. The national Commissioner of Police is attributing this  to  the  co-
operation between farm commandos and the South African Police.  Surely  that
is the recipe. It is tragic that the Defence Force has been  withdrawn  from
the Lesotho border. How could that be?

The  commissioner  pointed  out  that  sentences  were  used  to  scare  off
criminals. This should please be promoted. Shortcomings in our criminal  law
system have the opposite effect. Government's spokespersons and hon  members
of this House are sometimes guilty of using hate speech for  mere  political
gain or personal popularity. Little do we realise that  farmers'  lives  are
endangered by their doing that.

It is everyone's duty to work hard at adopting a better  attitude.  Negative
actions contribute to violence against innocent people. Stock theft  affects
all farmers extremely detrimentally. This also goes for small  and  emerging
farmers. Stock theft has  a  major  financial  impact.  Shortages  of  human
resources  and  equipment  handicap  our  security  forces.   Here   is   an
opportunity of creating  specialised  careers  that  will  have  a  positive
effect on the economy of our country.

As a Free Stater I would like to draw the  Minister's  attention  to  a  few
matters relating to the Lesotho border. Such  a  border  has  very  specific
security problems. I  would  like  to  refer  the  Minister  to  yesterday's
article in Die Volksblad. A Free State border farmer is  pleading  that  the
Government  should  not  forget  them.  Forty-four  expensive   stud   sheep
disappeared during the night, and this amounts to over R100 000 in  damages.
If we lost our salaries for a year and had to continue to live on  something
else in this Assembly, how many people would  still  be  sitting  here  next
month? That happens to our farmers. What would be the solution?

Should we involve Foreign Affairs to bring about  good  relations?  We  must
establish relations committees. There are  many  instances  where  relations
are not right. We are guilty on  both  sides.  The  border  road  should  be
rebuilt and used. A platoon should be stationed on farms. Fences  should  be
patrolled. These are stolen in their entirety. The impression  is  that  the
SAPS is not in control. As it should be, some South Africans were caught  in
Lesotho, and they were released after a year. What  does  this  say  to  our
farmers? We cannot leave it  as  it  is  at  the  expense  of  our  farmers.
Ordinary stock theft cases are poorly investigated. The  Minister  may  very
well investigate the percentage of convictions in cases of stock  theft.  It
is shockingly low. The stock theft units  no  longer  investigate  cases  of
theft involving fewer than five animals. This is a specialised field. We  do
not have specialists at the South African police stations to do  this  work.
Stock theft bedevils relations.

The hon the Minister should  please  be  sympathetic  with  regard  to  boom
gates. They are  very  expensive  and  that  is  why  they  are  asking  for
financial  assistance.  In  certain  areas  they  perform   very   important
functions. We should address the culture  of  violence.  We  should  restore
respect for life. It should be a joint  effort.  We  should  use  our  black
press. Their influence goes far.  Our  people  must  learn  to  comply  with
protocol for admission to our farms.]

Miss J E SOSIBO: Mr Chairperson, hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  the  ANC
welcomes the increased budget for the SAPS for 2002-03. The annual rise  and
growth of the Vote reflects Government's commitment to ensuring  the  safety
and security of South Africans and to  facilitating  the  employment  of  an
additional 16 000 police officers over the medium term. My focus today  will
be on the ICD, the secretariat and different units within the wider  context
of the budget.

The establishment of the ICD in 1997 brings South Africa in line with  other
democratic countries which have  created  similar  bodies.  These  countries
have  realised  the  desirability  of  having  an   objective   organisation
specialising in dealing with the tensions between community members and  the
police. The legacy of abuse of police  powers  revealed  by  the  Truth  and
Reconciliation Commission report emphasised the need for such  a  body.  Its
operation, as per recommendations of the TRC, should be independent  of  the
general police legislation.

The public distrust of the ability of the police to  investigate  complaints
against their own members has been borne out by revelations of police cover-
ups, involvement in misconduct at high level, etc. The aim of the ICD is  to
develop public confidence  in  the  efforts  of  the  SAPS,  the  SA  Police
Service, and the ICD, the Independent  Complaints  Directorate,  to  prevent
inappropriate  police  conduct  as  well  as  to  facilitate  the   criminal
prosecution of those members found to have engaged in criminal activities.

It is a historical fact that a sizeable number of people died in custody  at
the hands of the police. Therefore the  object  of  the  directorate  is  to
investigate any misconduct allegedly committed by any member  of  the  SAPS.
The misconduct or offence can include  the  death  of  a  person  in  police
custody and complaints referred to the ICD by the  Minister  of  Safety  and
Security or any provincial MEC.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission came up with the  recommendation  to
establish this directorate  because  it  had  received  hard  evidence  from
people who had been victimised and even died in police custody. Eight  years
down the line, through which we have worked as  a  country  towards  nation-
building,  it  is  still,  and  will  always   be,   necessary   to   cement
reconciliation between people and races in this country. We  have  succumbed
to much. We want to achieve much and  we  will  have  to  do  much  in  this
regard. It is our determination as the ANC Government.

The  ICD's  Vote  has   three   programmes,   namely   the   Administration,
Investigation of Complaints, and Monitoring and  Development.  The  ICD  has
set its priorities for the forthcoming years to include the  improvement  of
service delivery to the community. Creative ways and means will have  to  be
found in order to achieve this.

There are cases which the ICD investigated  in  the  period  April  2001  to
September 2001. It is hoped that the ICD will use its  resources  ultimately
to  conduct  quality  investigations  in   order   to   sustain   successful
prosecutions and convictions of guilty persons.  We  also  welcome  the  17%
increase.

Let me touch on the situation involving the secretariat. Section 208 of  the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa provides for the  establishment
of a secretariat to function  under  the  direction  of  the  Minister.  The
secretariat is mandated  by  the  SA  Police  Service  Act  to  provide  the
Minister with legal, policy, administrative and communication  support.  The
vision of the  secretariat  is  an  effective,  efficient,  transformed  and
democratically  accountable  SA  Police  Service  which  is  directed  by  a
Minister who  is  well  advised,  supported  and  assisted  on  all  matters
regarding safety and security.

The secretariat currently functions as a division of the SA Police  Service.
The matter of the  independence  of  the  secretariat  was  once  raise  and
addressed sharply. Three models  or  options  were  mentioned,  namely,  the
British  model,  the  SA  National  Defence  Force   secretariat   and   the
organisational  component  model.  The  latter  model  was   seen   as   the
recommended model, where the secretariat accounts to  Parliament.  But  this
issue is still under discussion.

Another recommendation was that the secretariat should have its own budget.
Akungabi nje ukuthi uma  bezosebenza,  njalo  kufuneke  baye  kocela  imali.
Mhlawumbe, kubonakala  kungaba  ngcono  uma  kungaba  nemali  ababelwa  yona
ukwenzela ukuthi bakwazi ukwenza umsebenzi wabo, ngendlela abafuna  ukuwenza
ngayo.

Mhlawumbe-ke, lokho kuyoba into engcono ngoba noma  ngabe  ukusebenza  kwabo
akucacile kahle hle, okwamanje, kodwa-ke akulula  ukubagxeka  ngoba  abanaso
isabiwomali  sabo.  Ake   ngilinganise   ngokuthi,   njengamakomidi,   nathi
sinezabelo zethu ezenza sikwazi ukwenza umsebenzi  wethu  ngendlela  esifuna
ukuwenza ngayo, ngaphandle kokuba silokhu siya kusihlalo wosihlalo  siyocela
imali. Mhlawumbe-ke, uma kungase kwenzeke kanjalo nakubona  kungaba  ngcono.
(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[It should not be the case that every time they want work, they  first  have
to ask for money. It will be better if they can have a budget so  that  they
will be able to do their work the way they want.

Maybe that  will  be  a  good  thing  because  even  if  their  job  is  not
satisfactory at the moment, it is not easy to criticise  them  because  they
do not have a budget. Let me give this example: we as  committees  have  our
own budgets which enable us to do our work the way we  want,  without  going
to the Chairperson to ask for some money. Perhaps if the same can  apply  to
them, it will be better.]

At  a  portfolio  committee  meeting,  the   secretariat   raised   numerous
complaints and concerns  regarding  the  current  state  of  affairs,  which
creates a lot of problems within the secretariat, for example in  its  daily
functioning. It is therefore recommended that the issue of the  independence
and budget of the secretariat should  be  discussed  with  the  Minister  of
Safety and Security as a matter of urgency.

Ake ngithinte nje kancane mayelana  nabaseshi  kanye  namacala.  NgoJanuwari
2001, uKhomishina kaZwelonke wamaphoyisa wamemezela  ukuthi  umnyango  wakhe
ufuna  ukuhlela  kabusha  uphiko  lwabaseshi  ukuze  lo  msebenzi  ukhaliphe
kakhudlwana.  Lokhu  kwakuzokwenzeka  ngokuba  kuhlanganiswe  zonke  izinhla
ezinhle  zabaseshi  ukuze  kungaphindaphindeki  uphenyo  ngoba  lezi  ezinye
izinhla zingaqondi ukuthi olunye uphiko  nalo  luphenya  lelo  cala.  Esinye
isizathu  kwakungukuba  kuncishiswe  isibalo  salezi  zinhla  nokuba  ulwazi
lwalabo  baseshi  luye  kosetshenziswa   ezikhungweni   zamaphoyisa,   kanye
nempahla ababeyisebenzisa.

Labo  abangabuyiselwanga  ezikhungweni   zamaphoyisa   bazofakwa   ezinhleni
ezintsha ezimbili zabaseshi ezibizwa  nge-organised  crime  unit  kanye  ne-
serious and violent crimes unit. Lezi  zinhla,  ngokusho  kweziphathimandla,
zizoba  nabasebenzi  abancane  ngokwesibalo   kodwa   abazoba   nokukhalipha
okunzulu.  Ukuncishiswa  kwalezi  zinhla  zabaseshi  kuzokwenza  ukuba  labo
abakuzona basebenze ngokuzimisela ngoba  kungelula  ukuhudula  izinyawo  uma
isibalo sabaseshi sisincane.

Kunezinhlelo   zabaseshi   ezingezukuphazanyiswa,   njengophiko    lwamacala
aphathelene   namabhizinisi,   uphiko   lwezodlame   olwenzeka   emindenini,
ukuvikelwa kwezingane namacala okuhlukumeza ngokobulili,  kanye  nokuvikelwa
kwezingane.  Uphiko  lokuphenya  ngamacala  ezamabhizinisi  lona  kusahlelwa
ukuthi luzomiswa kanjani. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Let me say something about investigators and cases.  In  January  2001  the
national Commissioner  of  the  South  African  Police  announced  that  his
department was restructuring an investigating unit so that its job would  be
more efficient. This will be achieved  by  uniting  all  good  investigating
units so that an investigation done by one unit cannot be  repeated  by  the
another owing to not knowing that they were both working on the  same  case.
Another reason was to decrease the number of these units  and  to  have  the
information  and  the  equipment  of  those  investigators  used  at  police
stations.

Those who were not returned to their police stations would  be  included  in
the two new structures of investigating  unit  called  the  organised  crime
unit and the serious and  violent  crime  unit.  According  to  authorities,
these units will have a few employees who  will  be  more  intelligent.  The
decrease in the size of these investigators' units will make those who  join
them work in a serious manner because it will not be easy to  be  lazy  when
the number of investigators is small.

There are investigating units that will not be touched,  like  the  business
crime units, child protection units and units that deal  with  sexual  abuse
and child protection. The business investigation unit is  being  planned  as
to how it is going to be set up.]

In conclusion, let me  say  it  is  hoped  that  the  restructuring  of  the
specialised units will lead to more skilled and  motivated  detectives,  and
will ultimately increase  the  capacity  to  combat  serious  crime  in  the
country.

The ANC supports the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson ...

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Nzotho!
The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Shenge! Chairperson, I do not know  why
the hon Groenewald latched onto a throwaway remark that I made, in terms  of
the presence in the House, when I started my address. In  any  event,  there
was a clear response to that from the Chair, which was  in  connection  with
many members of the House. I was not even referring to a particular  section
of the  House.  Members  are  busy  with  Parliament's  work.  They  are  in
committee meetings as we speak. So what I said had nothing to  do  with  the
absence of ANC members or any other hon members of the House.

But, in my response to the contributions  that  were  made  by  the  various
members of this House, I want to divide  that  response  into  a  number  of
demarcated areas, because I understood the contributions to  relate  to  the
following. Firstly, it was crimes against  women  and  children,  especially
against the girl child. The second area related  to  crimes  committed  with
the use of firearms. Then came the issue of infrastructure and  what  people
may have referred to here as police readiness to deal  with  crime  in  this
country. That, itself, was  divided  into  sections.  Some  of  the  members
talked to  the  force  levels,  training  of  our  police  officials,  their
deployment and the quality of their investigations. There  were  allegations
made regarding the dereliction of  duty  by  some  of  the  members  of  the
Service and other allegations of political manipulation of  the  members  of
the force. I want to concentrate on those areas in my  response.  But  there
are other issues on which I would want to make an appeal to the  chairperson
of the portfolio committee that we take them  down  for  further  discussion
within the portfolio committee. They will need  a  longer  time  for  us  to
engage on.

The first matter, therefore, is  in  regard  to  crimes  against  women  and
children. I want to deal with that in the following manner. The  matter  was
raised by a number of speakers, including the hon Morobe.  The  police  have
identified the 128 station areas that contribute, at least, to  50%  of  the
national rape statistics in our country. Special projects are  going  to  be
implemented  in  the  current  financial  year  to  give   effect   to   the
interdepartmental antirape strategy of the national  prosecuting  authority,
the Departments  of  Health  and  Social  Development,  and  the  SA  Police
Service. We are, to that extent, going to do the following. We are going  to
increase the number of family violence units, child  protection  and  sexual
offences units of the  SAPS,  and  special  detective  teams  will  also  be
created, at station level, to focus only on rape and domestic violence.

We are also going to ensure that  the  programmes  for  victim  support  are
expanded to assist victims during the criminal justice process.  Members  of
the House will be aware that there are a number of community safety  centres
that have been established right round the country. Those, in a sense,  will
be our one-stop centres where, in the first instance, we will have  sections
that will deal with reports of criminal offences, especially  against  those
who have been raped. Then there will be a  justice  component  there  and  a
clinic in order to facilitate the obtaining of statements and  to  correctly
process those cases. Then we will have a  prevention  and  public  education
initiative, for which a comprehensive research programme  is  under  way  to
determine the profiles of  the  offenders,  their  belief  systems  and  the
reasons  for  the  crimes  that  they  commit,  in  order  to   ensure   the
implementation of focused preventative actions.

The issue of crimes where firearms are used was raised very strongly by  the
hon Mluleki George. Well, as we are today honouring the memory of  our  late
Minister, Steve Tshwete, I am sure that we will appreciate that one  of  his
passions in the fight against crime related to the Firearms Control Act.  In
the circumstances, therefore, I would like to pay special attention  to  the
following areas in respect of this particular Act. Firstly, I would like  to
declare certain places right round the country  as  firearm-free  zones,  in
terms of section 140 of the Act. I am awaiting an operational plan from  the
SA Police Service that will indicate to me the best way in  which  this  can
be done. Of course, with the introduction of sector policing, we  are  going
to be responding in quite some detail in respect of this particular matter.

A special co-ordinating mechanism will also be created at national level  in
order to manage  the  destruction  of  redundant  state-owned  firearms  and
confiscated illegal firearms.  Since  the  implementation  of  the  national
crime combating strategy, more than 70 000  redundant  state-owned  firearms
and more than 80 000 confiscated firearms have  been  destroyed.  Operations
will be launched in high crime areas to track and  seize  illegal  firearms.
Using sophisticated measures, we will identify and  prosecute  suspects  who
may have been involved in firearm-related crimes.

Just the other day, this week, we conducted raids and confiscated  firearms.
The firearms  that  we  seized,  of  course,  belonged  to  people  who  had
licences. But it is not enough for a person to produce  a  licence  when  we
raid places like those that we raided the  other  day.  We  want  to  ensure
that, indeed, those licences are, in the first place, genuine  licences  and
that those firearms have not been used in any instances of crime.

The next issue, which quite a number of hon members raised,  is  the  matter
of infrastructure. I know that as members go round the country  doing  their
duty, as public representatives for our people, they do go  to  the  various
centres that we have and,  indeed,  they  see  the  things  that  they  were
talking about. However, I thought that, at least, members were alert when  I
talked about what we intend to do to address specifically that matter. I  do
want to repeat what I said, which is that an  amount  of  R215  million  has
been set aside for the erection and purchase of police facilities.  We  will
buy structures that are already there. We will build new structures  and  we
will renovate the structures that we already have.

The hon members will also note that funds  have  been  allocated  for  store
items and equipment. It means that the intention is  to  ensure  that  those
police stations that do not have the necessary equipment to  deal  with  the
various issues that have been raised here  will  be  empowered  through  the
supply of the necessary equipment. Of course, the issue of police  readiness
has been raised, relating to the police force levels  and  other  things.  I
have said that we are going to ensure that as many members  of  the  service
as possible will be on the streets to deal with crime. Among  other  things,
as we establish our sector  policing,  we  are  going  to  withdraw  trained
police personnel from functional duties  and  administrative  functions  and
deploy them on our streets.  Others,  of  course,  will  go  to  the  sector
policing programme that we have spoken about.

Other people  have  raised  the  issue  of  training  and  the  adequacy  or
otherwise of the training that we have. I would like  to  tell  hon  members
that we have a Police Service of people who are highly trained.  Of  course,
the situation in the country does not allow for the police  to  do  some  of
the things for which they have been trained to  indicate  how  well-oiled  a
machine they are to fight against crime. But  there  are  many  things  that
indicate that we have one of the finest policing units in the world.

The fact that statistics for crimes committed  in  this  country  are  going
down is an indication of  the  effectiveness  of  our  policing.  There  are
people who have come here and said that they have not seen this decrease  in
these crimes that are being committed in this country. Of  course  there  is
an argument for a regular release of statistics.

I am unhappy when people present a picture of a  South  Africa  that  is  as
bleak as some of our hon members do sometimes. It is not that bleak. I  have
not said there will be no statistics that will be placed  before  the  South
African nation. From time to time it  will  be  necessary  for  us  to  come
before the nation and say ``this is happening in the country''.

Mr M J ELLIS: How often will this be?

The MINISTER: We will not respond to those kinds of questions.  We  are  not
mechanical in the work that we do. We are driven by other things besides  us
taking pencils and making calculations on pieces of paper.

Another matter that has been raised is the quality of investigations. It  is
true that in some instances our investigations have been found to  be  poor.
The consequence of this is that there are cases that have  been  thrown  out
of court as a result.

I  want  to  deal  with  what  has  been  referred  to  here  as   political
manipulation. The hon members of Parliament must  please  do  what  everyone
else does. If members of the Service have conducted themselves in  a  manner
that is unbecoming, there are processes that ought to  be  followed.  It  is
worse when members of the  portfolio  committee  talk  about  it  from  this
platform, when they,  as  a  portfolio  committee  can  summon  all  of  us,
including me, to explain these things. [Applause.]

What is also worse is when politicians stand on a  platform  and  say  there
are police officials who participate in political machinations on  the  side
of certain political formations. If this is happening, then why  do  we  not
stand up and go and proffer complaints against such members? This cannot  be
a general phenomenon.

An example is that the  other  day,  on  Sunday  to  be  specific,  on  SABC
television, a presenter said that DP  leader  Tony  Leon  had  alleged  that
police, together with the ANC, were intimidating DA supporters. Speaking  in
Langa outside Cape Town, Leon said DA supporters  had  been  driven  out  of
their homes and their houses had been burnt. They then showed  his  face  on
TV and he said, and I quote:


  Unfortunately, we have the police  being  involved  in  the  campaign  of
  harassment and routinely arresting members of our  party  on  very,  very
  bogus charges and then we have to go to court to get them released.

If this is true then the DA has  a  responsibility,  particularly  to  those
affected members, to say, ``This police  person  has  done  this  and  I  am
pressing charges''. It does  not  help  to  make  these  kinds  of  sweeping
allegations. We must be truthful. Otherwise, if this does not  happen,  then
our people will have a right to  say  these  members  have  not  spoken  the
truth. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government:

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Madam  Speaker  and  hon
members, almost exactly  100  years  ago,  commenting  on  Britain's  social
inequalities in an address to the House of Commons, Keir Hardy, a member  of
parliament, said the following, and I quote:


  One factor in our national life remains with us. At  the  bottom  of  the
  social scale there is a mass of poverty and misery equal  to  that  which
  obtained a hundred years ago. I submit that the true test of progress  is
  not the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few, but  the  elevation
  of a people as a whole.

Mr Hardy could have addressed this House  in  the  same  words,  with  equal
resonance, 100 years later.

As part of the Year of  the  Volunteer  programme,  the  month  of  May  was
dedicated to  urban  and  rural  community  development.  Early  one  Friday
morning in May, as a contribution to this initiative, we assisted the  local
community of KwaThema in the Ekurhuleni Metro to clean up a  long  neglected
cemetery. A few days later,  we  were  in  the  Eastern  Cape.  We  went  to
Mdantsane and helped to clean up the township. Towards the end of the  month
we travelled to Chris Hani district municipality to assist to  lay  a  water
pipeline to supply water to a school 10 km away.

When we undertook these trips we were accompanied by senior  representatives
of the Department of Provincial and Local  Government.  What  struck  us  in
this and other areas we visited last month and what makes Mr  Hardy's  words
so poignant is how much work we still need  to  do  to  improve  the  living
areas of all our people.

As Government, we can take pride in the fact that over a very  short  period
of time, we have completely overhauled the system  of  local  government  in
our country. We have boundaries in place that  represent  the  diversity  of
communities living within  them,  we  have  new  structures  with  which  to
provide a clear framework within which local councils can work and  we  have
new systems of doing business in municipalities which are reflective of  the
challenges that face us at the local level.

But, the task of positively impacting on entrenched  poverty  and  improving
the lives of those of our people who are most marginalised  in  places  such
as  kwaThema,  Mdantsane,  Thambo  village  in  the  Chris   Hani   district
municipality, still  represents  our  single  biggest  challenge.  The  real
challenge we face is to define in practical terms what  developmental  local
government means and the type of leadership and interventions it  calls  for
at the local level.

Let me illustrate this point with an example. When  we  were  in  Queenstown
last month, we met a local businessman,  Dr  Ntozakhe,  a  highly  qualified
chemist. Dr Ntozakhe owns a factory in the area which produces high  quality
animal feed and employs 16 people. The success of the business is such  that
he has identified significant opportunities for exporting the product.

The company has already completed orders from the UK and  Uruguay.  However,
he lacks the capital to invest  further  in  this  endeavour.  Part  of  the
problem is that his input costs  are  very  high,  especially  the  cost  of
maize, one of the primary raw materials in the animal feed which he  imports
from Limpopo, the Free State and Mpumalanga.

On making inquiries from the council, I  discovered  that  the  municipality
owns tracts of fertile land ideal for growing  maize.  This  land  currently
lies dormant and unused. If the council perceived its role  differently,  it
would possibly find a way of agreeing  on  how  this  local  resident  could
access municipal land,, grow his maize and export his feed. It  would  quite
obviously benefit from the deal by renting or selling the  land,  generating
rates from its productive use, creating employment for another  10  or  more
residents to work the land and, in so  doing,  provide  a  stimulus  to  the
local economy.

While clearly our municipalities are not in the business of  farming  maize,
they are in the business  of  creating  viable  local  communities  through,
amongst other things, stimulating the local economy.  The  challenge  facing
local  leaders  is  to  be  more  innovative  in  their  thinking,  in   the
interpretation of their role and in the  implementation  of  their  mandate.
This challenge goes out to members of Parliament as well.  Perhaps  we  need
to make an effort to engage with  communities  directly  and  get  a  deeper
understanding on how the Government policies we  endorse  and  the  laws  we
pass impact on people on the ground.

This deepened understanding will not only help our people to put a  face  to
our functions and our Government, but will ensure that future decisions  are
rooted in the realities of our country.

In his state of the nation address earlier this year, President Mbeki  said,
and I quote:


  ... the central question we will have to answer at the end of the day  is
  whether what  we  are  doing  as  the  legislature,  the  executive,  the
  judiciary, the fourth estate and civil society, is helping to  lift  from
  the shoulders of  our  people  the  intolerable  burden  of  poverty  and
  underdevelopment.

In large part the responsibility for  lifting  this  intolerable  burden  of
poverty and underdevelopment has been left to our  municipalities.  But  the
enormity of the task is such that every stakeholder grouping  in  the  local
sphere will have to get  involved.  Each  of  us  has  a  responsibility  to
contribute to the building of our locality. We must get  involved.  When  we
said, ``the people shall govern'', we meant those who are both  in  and  out
of Parliament and other structures of Government.

Governance comes with responsibility. We should take part in  this  task  of
governing by giving of our time  and  resources  to  make  sure  that  local
government is working.

If one is an accountant and the municipality one resides in is in dire  need
of fixing its treasury operations, one should  make  one's  time  and  skill
available to the municipality. If one lives in an informal  settlement  that
is  poorly  serviced,  one  should  take  it  upon  oneself  to  keep  one's
environment clean. This is what is meant by people governing.

Our new system of local government is now 18  months  old.  On  14  December
2001, the President's Co-ordinating  Council  convened  to  assess  progress
made in the first year of the attempt at  establishing  new  municipalities.
Together with the President, premiers of provinces  and  representatives  of
organised  local  government,  we  undertook  a  critical  review  of  local
government since the municipal elections of  December  2000.  We  were  also
assisted in this task by the report of the  Ministerial  Advisory  Committee
appointed to review the challenges facing local government.

Although members may not  agree  with  every  conclusion  made  in  the  two
reports, I am sure that they will find the insights contained  therein  very
useful indeed. It is for this reason that the Ministry  and  the  department
have decided to reproduce the reports and to make them  available  to  every
member of Parliament.

We found the reports useful as we crafted an action plan, the aim  of  which
is to improve the quality of support given  to  municipalities  by  national
and  provincial  governments,  as  well  as  by  the  SA  Local   Government
Association. An intense programme of action focusing on the  following  five
strategic objectives will be unfolded across  all  municipalities:  firstly,
building a strong local government sphere and further enhancing  its  status
within  a  stable  co-operative  governance  framework;  secondly,  building
stable  institutional  and  administrative  systems  in  local   government;
thirdly,   deepening   local   democracy   and   accountability;   fourthly,
accelerating  service  delivery  and  economic  development;  and,   lastly,
building financially viable local government.

Both the Ministry and the Department of Provincial and Local Government  are
committed to the success of this programme of action,  and  we  will  ensure
its  success  by  providing  additional  financial  resources,   appropriate
legislation and the necessary programmatic interventions. This is  reflected
in recent and  planned  increases  in  the  national  allocations  to  local
government and the priorities of the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government's Budget Vote for this financial year.

The largest increases in national Government's 2002 Budget are in  transfers
to the local government sphere, rising by 18,3% a year from 2001-02 to 2004-
05. Total allocations rise from R6,6 billion in 2001-02 to R8,6  billion  in
2002-03, R10,2 billion in 2003-04 and R10,9 billion in 2004-05.

Allocations for local government infrastructure  transfers  rise  from  R2,2
billion last year to R3,3 billion this year, R3,9 billion in 2003-04 and  R4
billion  in  2004-05.  This  represents  an  annual  increase  of  21,3%  in
infrastructure funding between 2001-02 and 2004-05.

Our commitment to assisting municipalities with  poverty  relief,  primarily
through the provision of free basic services to  poor  households,  is  made
clear by substantial increases in the equitable share grant.

Eight years  after  the  end  of  apartheid,  the  local  economy  is  still
characterised by a massively differential access to resources. In  order  to
redress this, we have  to  stay  focused  on  the  task  of  building  local
communities that present economic opportunities for  all  our  people.  Only
then can we ensure that the dividend of democratic change is felt by all.
This brings into sharp focus the need for a more innovative approach to  job
creation and economic development beyond the formal economy. In  particular,
we need an approach to economic development that  will  impact  directly  on
unemployment and poverty, especially in the  most  marginalised  sectors  of
our economy. It is our firm belief that by increasing economic  activity  at
the local level and targeting  the  poor,  we  assist  in  generating  local
employment and wealth creation.

The Ministry and the Department of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  will
continue to do  everything  necessary  and  possible  to  provide  increased
stability and predictability to the local environment. A number of  measures
are  being  introduced  to  enhance  the  revenue-raising  powers  of  local
government. These include  legislative  measures  to  improve  property  tax
administration, clarify municipal tax powers and  reform  regional  services
council levies. We intend to place  the  Property  Rates  Bill  before  this
House this year, reworked  after  a  lengthy  period  of  consultation  with
stakeholders.
We recognise that improved  billing  systems  and  enhanced  credit  control
policy are key to sustainability and  stability  at  the  local  level.  The
problem of municipal debt is attributable to three key issues. Firstly,  the
affordability of rates and tariffs must be appropriate - that is,  if  rates
and tariffs are too high, many people will be  unable  to  afford  them  and
will simply not pay. Secondly, the level of services  being  provided  by  a
municipality must justify the payment of rates. Thirdly, the  administration
systems regarding the collection of revenues must  be  effective  to  ensure
that people feel compelled to pay.

In May  this  year  I  initiated  a  working  group  representing  municipal
managers and chief finance officers and the  Department  of  Provincial  and
Local Government to review credit control measures  in  municipalities  with
large service-related debts, the majority  of  which  are  in  Gauteng.  The
recommendations of this working  group  will  be  used  to  further  enhance
municipal credit control policy.

The finalisation of the boundaries of new municipalities as well as  clarity
on the powers and functions of different categories of  municipalities  will
lead to increased predictability around municipal revenue streams. Added  to
this, the further consolidation of grant funding  from  national  Government
over  a  three-year  period,  the  period  of  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure
Framework, will improve the predictability and transparency of transfers.

Financially  well-managed  municipalities  will  increasingly  be  able   to
capitalise on these improvements in  the  local  environment  to  borrow  or
leverage financing and to repay loans from existing revenue streams such  as
intergovernmental transfers, municipal taxes, or user tariffs.

Increased  accountability  is  already  being  achieved  through  the  Local
Government: Municipal Systems Act and will be further enhanced  through  the
Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill. This  Bill  will  bring
about changes to budget processes, formats and reporting  requirements.  The
aim is to create improved and  more  accountable  local  environments,  with
better services distributed across a wider spectrum of the population.

The Municipal Infrastructure Investment Unit has embarked on a programme  of
undertaking diagnostic studies in a number of municipalities,  to  determine
the opportunity for private-sector investment in these localities. Teams  of
experts are deployed on a short-term basis and a report  is  tabled  to  the
MIIU within four to six weeks  so  that  viable  public-private  partnership
projects may be quickly  conceptualised.  Government  is  closely  assessing
these diagnostic studies. They play an  important  role  in  helping  us  to
understand how municipalities, civil society organisations and  the  private
sector are collectively undertaking the task of service delivery.

We are conscious of the need to improve the  capacity  of  our  councils  to
meet the needs of communities. To this end, we have  finalised  a  capacity-
building framework and have  directed  resources  into  a  capacity-building
programme and capacity-building grants to support institutional  development
and reform.

The Municipal Systems Improvement Programme provides  direct  assistance  to
municipalities  for  capacity-building  and  implementing  the  new  systems
required by local  government  legislation.  This  grant  increases  to  R93
million this year, to R100 million next year and to R132  million  in  2004-
05. The primary capacity-building initiatives include the following.

Planning, implementation and management support, or Pims, centres are  being
set  up  and  funded  in  district  municipalities,  to  assist   with   the
preparation of integrated development plans in line with municipal  budgets.
Thirty such centres have been set up and are receiving funding.

Nodal delivery teams which provide support for  the  identification,  design
and management of projects within the rural and urban development nodes  are
being set up and funded.

The Local Economic Development programme provides support to  municipalities
on the role of LED and how to implement and integrate strategies.  The  fund
has supported projects in 188 municipalities,  with  88%  of  municipalities
having received training on LED in 2001.

Currently  the  programme  on  administrative  systems  and   processes   is
initiating a ward  committee  development  programme  within  our  capacity-
building programme.

We also established the SA Cities Support and Learning  Network  for  metros
and large cities last  year.  It  meets  on  a  regular  basis  and  focuses
primarily on improving the performance of cities in order to enable them  to
better play their role in the national economy.

Since the beginning of last year, the Consolidated Municipal  Infrastructure
Programme has focused on  providing  project-related  technical  skills  and
business skills training.

These initiatives will assist municipalities to  increase  participation  by
community members in service delivery, improve the accuracy  of  information
on service delivery, enhance political oversight  over  decision-making  and
improve accountability for service delivery outcomes.

The further entrenching of the Integrated Development Planning  system  will
add increased rigour to the planning system at the local level.

In terms of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, all  municipalities
have to complete an annual integrated development programme,  or  IDP.  Many
were able to submit their IDPs by the  end  of  March  this  year.  The  IDP
system is now an institutionalised reality at the local level and it is  the
primary planning tool in all municipalities.

This is borne out by an assessment of  the  IDP  process  conducted  by  the
Department of Provincial and Local Government. It was  found  that  although
the preparation of IDPs is often inadequate, the involvement and  commitment
of councillors and senior officials is very high. Also, there  seems  to  be
an  increased  realisation  of  the  benefits  and  significance  of  proper
planning. Even in cases where  IDPs  are  incomplete,  they  have  a  strong
influence on the budget of the municipality. Also  heartening  is  the  fact
that most municipalities set up  IDP  representative  forums  to  facilitate
community and stakeholder participation in the IDP process.

A comprehensive national support  system  has  been  put  in  place  by  the
department to assist  municipalities  with  the  IDP  process.  The  support
system includes a training programme based  on  a  set  of  guidelines,  IDP
funding, the establishment of  Pims  centres  in  most  districts,  hands-on
support provided by a national IDP task team to complement the Pims  centres
and provincial support programmes.

Since its inception, the Consolidated  Municipal  Infrastructure  Investment
Programme,  or  CMIP,  has  spent  R3,8  billion   in   the   provision   of
infrastructure for services to approximately 12 million poor households.
The  programme  also  assists  in  setting  up  small,  medium   and   micro
enterprises, or SMMEs, to work on infrastructure projects and  provides  on-
the-job training for these SMMEs.

Government has taken responsibility for stimulating  economic  activity  and
growth in hitherto low-investment, low-growth areas.

To this end, we have identified a total of 21 nodal municipalities  for  the
implementation  of  the  Urban  Renewal   Programme   and   the   Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Programme. As far as these two programmes  are
concerned, significant progress has been made.

Regarding the rural development programme,  over  120  projects  worth  R3,7
billion were identified, using interim IDP  through  consultative  workshops
in November 2001. In December 2001, projects were  further  refined  and  22
priority projects worth R584 million were identified for 2002-03.  They  are
currently being implemented, while 52% are in the planning stages.
This  year,  the  department  is  investing  an  extra   R700   million   of
infrastructure funding, which will rise to R2 billion in  the  year  2004-05
in the rural and urban nodes. This funding will  improve  infrastructure  in
these areas and build the base of public assets. The  Department  of  Labour
has prioritised R18 million for skills development in support  of  our  work
in the nodal areas.

The Eskom Rural Development Foundation is  gearing  up  to  supporting  more
nodes in rural development, including electrification.  The  UN  Development
programme is assisting with a monitoring and evaluation  system  to  support
the programme to the  tune  of  $350  000.  Various  parastatals  and  donor
agencies are in discussion as to how they can support the programme.

A nodal assessment was completed in 2001 for all eight nodes  in  the  Urban
Renewal Programme, and a report detailing the  situation  in  each  node  is
available. Business plans have been completed for seven of eight  nodes.  In
doing this, the development path of the nodes has been charted  and  clearly
defined.

In November last year, I had the pleasure of  assisting  Old  Mutual  launch
its Rural Economic Development Initiative in Emanguzi,  which  falls  within
Umkanyakude District Municipality, one of the nodes of the RDP  in  KwaZulu-
Natal. The Rural Economic Development Initiative focuses on  local  economic
development, education, health and welfare activities in marginalised  areas
and complements well the aims of our RDP.

A few months ago, we met a delegation from the Afrikaanse  Handelsinstituut.
They have representative bodies in many of our municipalities and  they  had
come to volunteer their services  to  local  government.  We  are  currently
working on a programme of activities with them.

Hon members will recall  that  in  April  2000  the  department  released  a
discussion  document  titled  ``Towards  a  White   Paper   on   Traditional
Leadership and Institutions''. We have recorded the  responses  we  received
in that regard. The responses helped us to reach a point where  we  are  now
poised to bring the matter to finality.

We were particularly impressed by the provincial governments of the  Eastern
Cape, the Free State, North West, Mpumalanga, and  Limpopo.  They  took  the
issue of consultation with the people very seriously.  They  took  steps  to
ensure the visibility of the rural masses in policy formation.

I am happy to announce that a programme of action has been approved  by  the
special Cabinet committee on the institutions of traditional  leadership.  A
draft White Paper has been finalised and is  to  be  presented  to  Cabinet.
Thereafter, I will announce the appointment of the White  Paper  task  team,
which will refine the White Paper on the basis of inputs  received.  I  will
also announce the appointment of the legislation drafting team,  which  will
draft national legislation that will provide a national  framework  and  set
national norms and standards.

Provincial legislatures will pass legislation which takes into  account  the
fact that custom and tradition differ from one population group to  another.
Both the White Paper task  team  and  the  legislation  drafting  team  will
include stakeholders, amongst whom there  will  be  representatives  of  the
institutions of traditional leadership.

The legislation  drafting  team  will  work  very  closely  with  provincial
counterparts in at  least  six  provinces  where  the  institutions  have  a
presence. We are determined to ensure that both the  required  national  and
provincial legislation, in this regard, is passed  by  November  this  year.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr Y I CARRIM: Madam Speaker, comrades and friends, a fundamental aspect  of
apartheid, as we all know, was division,  separation,  fragmentation  -  not
just in racial and ethnic terms, but in every aspect of society.  There  was
just no centre and no common core.

Conversely,  our  national  democratic  project  seeks  to   create   unity,
cohesion, and direction. But, in a way, that recognises the  plurality,  the
diversity of our society. Key, though, for the success of the project  is  a
significant measure  of  co-ordination,  not  just  within  government,  but
between government and civil society.

So it is that we crafted a unique model of  government  that  draws  on  the
best of both the unitary and federal models. So  it  is  that  we  speak  of
South Africa as ultimately having  one  system  of  governance,  with  three
distinctive, interdependent and interrelated  spheres.  And  so  too  do  we
speak not just of government but governance, the notion that government  and
civil society must work together.

Of course, we have made major strides towards national  co-ordination  since
1994. But, obviously, we have a long way to go.  Understandably,  while  old
fragmentations disappear, new ones appear between insiders and outsiders  of
the  new  economy,  between  and  within  spheres  of  government,   between
government and civil society, between and within the most  elementary  units
in society, including the family.

In fact, the President, in this House and elsewhere, has called for  greater
national consensus. By this, I think, he means greater consensus,  not  just
among the parties in this House, but in  society  as  a  whole.  And  he  is
absolutely right. In fact, one of  our  major  challenges  is  to  establish
greater national cohesion, despite our diversity.

In short, there is greater co-ordination and cohesion today.  But  there  is
also not enough of it. There are old issues, new issues, and new,  forms  of
old issues to be  addressed.  What  is  clear  is  that  we  need  new  more
imaginative ways of trying to achieve greater co-ordination and cohesion.  I
am interested  to  see  that  the  Minister's  speech  was  also,  I  think,
underpinned by this observation.

In fact, more than any other department, it is the Department of  Provincial
and Local Government that has  to  contribute  to  this.  As  our  portfolio
committee reviewed the budget and work of the  department  and  reported  to
Parliament, as published in the ATC of 10 June, we concluded that there  are
two key related challenges that confront the department: firstly,  the  need
to ensure greater co-ordination and integration; and secondly, the  need  to
contribute far more effectively  to  capacity-building  in  the  variety  of
senses identified in the report, as will be dealt  with  by  other  speakers
later in the debate.

As  a  contribution  towards  greater  co-ordination   and   cohesion,   the
department's strategic plan is welcome, as is its  commitment  to  link  the
plan more closely to the  budget  and  the  internal  restructuring  of  the
department. Welcome, too, is the department's  commitment  to  more  closely
link its work to the broader goals of Government as  a  whole,  of  economic
growth, job creation, development and redistribution.

Interestingly, the department speaks not just  of  co-operative  governance,
but increasingly of integrated governance. This  is  absolutely  right,  and
the need for this is going to be tested  perhaps  most  in  respect  of  the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme  and  the  Urban  Renewal
Programme. In our report to Parliament the committee observed that:


  ... the success of the ISRDP  and  URP  depend  crucially  on  integrated
  governance - and the success of  these  programmes  will  also  serve  to
  enhance integrated  governance.  An  important  barometer  of  integrated
  governance therefore will be progress on the ISRDP and URP.

The Minister  also  reported  that  the  President's  Co-ordinating  Council
meeting  last  December  mandated  the  department  to  ensure  greater  co-
ordination between the programmes and projects of  national  and  provincial
departments and IDPs. It is clear that for IDPs to work properly, there  has
to be more effective co-operation of  all  spheres  of  government  and,  of
course, between government and civil society.

Clearly, the committee believes that it is not for the state alone  to  take
responsibility  for  ensuring  co-ordination.   All   of   us,   Government,
Parliament, traditional leaders and civil society, have a role to play.  Our
very committee, as we have repeatedly said in our report, can  do  far  more
in this regard and in other respects.

Very closely linked to the  need  for  co-ordination  is  partnerships.  Co-
ordination will facilitate partnerships and, of  course,  partnerships  will
facilitate co-ordination. Closely linked to co-ordination  and  partnerships
is capacity-building. In fact, in our report to  Parliament  we  once  again
called for greater  co-ordination  of  capacity-building,  stakeholders  and
programmes. Hon member Arthur Lyle will deal with  this  aspect  in  greater
detail.

The department's budget has, of course, been increased by 34,8%  in  nominal
terms. Most significant is the increase to local  government.  Transfers  to
local government go up by 18,3% over the three-year MTEF period.
In our report we noted that:


  The Committee welcomes the increases  in  the  budget,  particularly  for
  local government. The Committee is pleased, too, that, unlike last  year,
  district municipalities will be  receiving  funds  from  the  ``equitable
  share''. Of course, the allocation  to  local  government  is  still  not
  adequate. The Committee does not believe, however, that the  answer  lies
  in flinging more money at local government. Municipalities have  to  make
  more effort to raise the revenue due to  them  from  their  own  sources,
  spend  money  more  strategically  and  productively,  and  manage  their
  finances better. Over time, however, national  government  will  have  to
  allocate more money to local government if local government is to  fulfil
  its increasing  responsibilities.  The  Department,  too,  now  has  more
  responsibilities to fulfil with its bigger budget, and needs  to  further
  develop its capacity to spend and allocate its budget more effectively.

As a  committee  we  think  that  the  three  big  related  issues  are  co-
ordination, partnerships and capacity-building. Within the  framework  of  a
sensible and sensitive appreciation of the  separation  of  powers,  we  are
very keen to co-operate with the department to advance these tasks.

We are pleased to see, too, that the  Minister  reported  to  the  committee
that Cabinet is  considering  including  municipal  staff  as  part  of  the
national Public Service. In fact, this will allow for  mobility,  especially
of officials from the national and provincial spheres to  local  government.
We especially welcome that. [Interjections.]

In conclusion, I want to express the committee's  appreciation  to  Minister
Mufamadi,  Deputy  Minister  Botha,  the  acting   director-general,   Craig
Clerihew, the parliamentary liaison officer, Selby Mashile, and  members  of
the department for their co-operation. We want to record  our  appreciation,
too, to the previous director-general Dan Titus, who has now been  appointed
as an adviser to the Minister - in fact, he is somewhere in this  Chamber  -
and for whom we will be holding a reception after this meeting.

May I, on  behalf  of  the  Minister,  also  welcome  all  members  to  that
reception, especially as  the  numbers  begin  to  shrink  as  every  minute
passes. So members should feel free - only, of course, those  who  sit  here
until 20:15 this evening - to attend  this  function  in  the  Old  Assembly
dining room.

My thanks also to members of the committee for their co-operation,  and,  in
particular, to the ANC study group for their liveliness and for  being  such
a fun and funny study group. I am especially pleased to be  responsible  for
this study group in particular. [Interjections.] Finally, my thanks  to  the
three shining stars, researchers Debhi Hene  and  Chris  Sibanyoni  and  the
committee secretary, Llewellyn Brown. My thanks to them all. [Applause.]

Mrs G M  BORMAN:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Ministers  and  hon  members,  local
government is facing enormous  challenges  such  as  restructuring,  service
delivery,  capacity-building,  implementing  new  legislation,  creating   a
culture of payment, introducing performance contracts, public  participation
and developing indigent  policies  and  credit  control  policies.  Enormous
challenges bring with them enormous responsibilities.

This year local government, as we  have  already  heard,  has  received  the
biggest increase in the budget - R6,6  billion  with  substantial  increases
over the next few years. In addition to the equitable share,  the  municipal
infrastructure programme  and  capacity-building  grants  all  significantly
increased in order to get delivery to the people. I  have  no  problem  with
this, but I do have a problem when people do not pay. We are told that  over
R22 billion is owed to  municipalities  in  outstanding  accumulative  debt.
According to The Citizen of 20 May 2002, the  residents  in  Tembisa  ``have
been  given  a  taste  of  debt-free  life  following  an  announcement   by
Ekurhuleni mayor, Duma Nkosi ÿ.ÿ.ÿ.  that  the  R600  million  owed  to  the
council will not reflect on their  future  accounts''.  The  Durban  unicity
council has lost millions of rands as a  result  of  theft,  bad  debts  and
uncollected traffic fines. This is revealed in the Auditor-General's  annual
report. There were 330 cases of  fraud  amounting  to  R50  million,  cheque
fraud in excess of R1 million, cash theft of R3,9 million, theft of  council
material and manipulation of stock records in excess of R1 million  and  the
city police have failed to collect funds totalling at least R115 million.

How many times do we open up our newspapers with these sorts of reports?  We
will not get local government onto a sustainable basis if we do not  address
inefficient management. In addition, today we have mayors who  do  not  know
what the mayor's discretionary fund is for. They think it is  an  additional
``bonsela'' for them to dip into to pay all their  personal  expenses.  Here
Mayor Faku of the Nelson Mandela metropole is a very good  example,  but  he
is not the only one. He allegedly used nearly R81 000  to  pay  for  traffic
fines, clothing, sporting goods, air tickets, tuition fees and even his  own
municipal rates.

Some mayors are living in palatial homes provided for by the ratepayer -  R3
million for the Tshwane mayor. Councillors are owing hundreds  of  thousands
of rands in rates and charges - from Butterworth to  Ekurhuleni  to  Durban,
to name but a few - perpetuating the  culture  of  nonpayment.  Fancy  cars,
palatial houses, lavish functions, nonpayment - all  the  hallmarks  of  our
modern mayor and councillor. What we need are a few  more  mayors  with  the
sense of commitment that the mayor of Richmond in KwaZulu-Natal  has  -  and
this is an ANC mayor. He turned down a fancy 4x4  in  favour  of  using  the
money to build a resource centre with a full library,  laboratory,  computer
centre and facilities for indoor  games  and  extra  lessons  in  maths  and
science, for his own town's youth.  He  uses  a  Toyota  Hilux  bakkie.  The
report in the Sunday Times dated 13 January 2002 says:


  Even the culture of nonpayment of service charges has been turned around,
  with the number of paying  township  residents  increasing  from  10%  to
  almost 70%.

The Highway Mail in Durban yesterday came up with  the  headline:  ``Unicity
council meeting turns into a circus''. According to the report, the  council
meeting turned into a circus when the director of water  services  needed  a
9,9% increase in the water tariff. The  ANC  proposed  6,5%,  which  left  a
shortfall of R54 million. The meeting adjourned  for  15  minutes  to  allow
caucusing, and when they returned the ANC and the MF  were  toyi-toying  and
dancing. The meeting had to be adjourned, leaving the officials  to  go  and
find the shortfall. But why worry about mounting  deficits  and  debts  when
one can spend and sing and dance? Who  worries  about  a  city  like  Durban
eventually grinding to a halt?

If Government is serious about service  delivery,  there  are  some  serious
concerns that have to be addressed. The first is that municipalities  cannot
spend what they do not have. Secondly, people have to  learn  that  if  they
enjoy services, they have to pay for them. A culture of payment  must  be  a
top priority. Thirdly, billing systems must be in place  for  proper  credit
control. Extravagant and wasteful spending,  inefficient  management  and  a
lack of commitment  to  collecting  revenue  will  not  come  right  through
legislation or pouring more money into local government. The DA  would  like
to support the Budget Vote for local government, but when we  see  the  lack
of delivery and the total disregard for  exercising  good  stewardship  over
ratepayers' money, we cannot support it. [Applause.]

May I just add my own thanks to those of our chair for the hard work of  the
department and all they do, and the questions and much  patience  that  they
have in our committee meetings. Thanks, I will answer any questions  in  the
committee room. [Applause.]

Mr B J NOBUNGA: Madam Speaker  and  hon  members,  according  to  the  first
principle of the Freedom Charter, which says, ``The people  shall  govern'',
there are three subprinciples, which set out universal suffrage and state:


  All bodies of minority rule, advisory bodies,  councils  and  authorities
  shall be replaced by democratic organs of self-government.
These have been achieved in 1994  and  1995  respectively.  But  the  second
relating to local government was fully realised in 2000 when the first wall-
to-wall local government structures were  created.  However,  there  is  the
greatest challenge that remains, the subprinciple which says,  ``All  people
shall be entitled to take part in the administration of the  country,''  and
this was coupled with the right to enjoy the same rights.

To realise the task of  participation  in  administration  and  development,
allowing the people to be their own liberators, requires that we  treat  the
greater transformation very carefully to avoid worsening the conditions  our
people find themselves in in most of these newly created municipalities.  We
have the  following  immediate  tasks  in  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty, in the words of the call made  by  the  President  in  his  opening
address to Parliament. This can be done by raising the  economic  status  of
our people. However, there are challenges that we face as  this  Government,
which include increasing the economic base of the  previously  disadvantaged
areas, increasing the awareness  of  the  need  to  pay  for  services,  and
implementing the indigent policy and the  policy  of  providing  free  basic
services.

The  greatest  challenges  include  the  participation  of  the  people   in
municipal budget processes and planning through  the  IDPs.  Much  has  been
done, but a lot more needs to be done if we are to succeed in reversing  the
skewed development patterns created by the apartheid  past.  These  are  not
going to be easily reached as there are even greater  challenges  caused  by
the restructuring of other state departments which make the  fight  to  make
municipalities financially independent and viable difficult.

The restructuring of Eskom, in particular, is going  to  rob  municipalities
of badly  needed  revenue  that  would  reduce  their  relying  on  national
Government for funding. Whilst it is  understood  that  some  municipalities
would not have been able to run this service, some  have  been  crippled  by
this decision.

We welcome the decision to allow National Treasury  to  fund  municipalities
to the tune of R2,4 billion for five years on the revenue lost  due  to  the
restructuring  of  Eskom.  However,  the  future  sustainability   of   this
arrangement will create dependency problems when it is terminated.

It is encouraging to note the progress that has been  made  in  speeding  up
the transformation process, but there are still great challenges  that  need
the department's attention. The following issues are  of  note.  The  cross-
boundary municipalities  challenges  require  the  department  to  seriously
consider opening the issue of the  readjustment  of  provincial  boundaries.
This will go a long way in ensuring that we  once  and  for  all  solve  the
problem facing these  areas.  The  issue  of  cross-boundary  municipalities
should not be seen as  a  permanent  feature  in  our  structures  of  local
government.  Much  as  they  solve  the  fundamental  problem  of  providing
uninterrupted provision of much-needed services  without  the  hindrance  of
the bureaucratic red tape created by provincial  boundaries,  we  can  still
create  better  boundaries  that  would  give  rise  to  changed  provincial
boundaries  that  would  give  a  lasting  solution  to   the   shortcomings
experienced by these cross-border municipalities.

As for the task of finalising the allocation  of  powers  and  functions  to
municipalities, without proper powers  and  functions,  municipalities  will
not succeed in the task of  making  the  lives  of  our  people  better.  We
understand the fact that our model of local government is new, and that  its
evolution will take some time to really  bear  fruits,  but  that  does  not
change the fact that real change and delivery take place at this level.

We owe it to all those who fought  and  died  for  the  liberation  of  this
country and its people to make this sphere of government work. We  dare  not
fail.

The task of speeding up the provision of free basic services in areas  where
these services are mostly needed,  especially  in  rural  areas,  is  great.
There is great appreciation for the progress that has been  made  in  trying
to make free basic services available. But, unfortunately, the progress  has
only been made in big cities and towns. It might be small  towns  that  have
benefited, but the number is insignificant.  The  department  should  ensure
that the poor and  needy  areas  become  the  great  beneficiaries  in  this
regard.

The finalisation of policies in the provision of free basic services by  the
department impacting on the overall local government policy  on  free  basic
services is urgent. The task is to make councillor  training  more  relevant
and  to  make  a  meaningful  contribution   in   changing   the   type   of
representative to be equal to the task of making better municipalities.

Good delivery is  premised  on  informed  policy-makers,  so  the  need  for
councillor training remains our key critical challenge. However, we have  to
look at the issue of the empowerment of  Salga  as  a  body  that  has  been
created, amongst others, to take care of  the  empowerment  of  councillors.
Salga needs to pick up its momentum, otherwise it will  lag  behind  in  the
task of equipping councillors to face their crucial task  of  improving  the
lives and conditions of our people.

Regarding the task to make local  government  participatory,  efficient  and
effective in its administration, the type of civil service we have  must  be
equipped to face this challenge. Therefore we have to look at  the  capacity
of these officials. The Local Government, Water and  Related  Services  Seta
is tasked with the responsibility of  equipping  these  administrators  with
the necessary skills in  local  government  at  and  beyond  this  point  of
transition. There is improvement in its work, but a lot more  can  still  be
achieved.

Another immediate task is to check the usefulness and  contribution  of  the
city support and learning network  and  the  contribution  it  can  make  to
speeding up  transformation  in  municipalities.  The  other  transformation
challenge issue goes beyond municipalities, and it is  with  the  department
itself. The different provincial departments are supposed  to  rise  to  the
occasion and assist municipalities when required to do so. There is a  great
need for the department  to  stabilise  itself  in  collaboration  with  all
stakeholders if it is going to succeed  in  achieving  the  task  of  making
local government workable  and  getting  local  government  to  improve  its
economies.

[In conclusion, I would like to round off my speech by stating that  we  are
also making the same announcement that was made by  the  President  of  this
country; that we should all go out and try our level  best  to  support  our
municipalities according to their diversity. We  should  encourage  them  to
pay for services rendered to them. We, as MPs, should play  a  leading  role
and be part of the development of municipalities in our constituency.]

Mr P F SMITH: Mr Chairperson, Ministers present, colleagues,  in  addressing
the department's Budget Vote, the IFP is going to be concentrating  on  this
one issue,  namely  that  of  transition.  We  are  going  to  be  making  a
particular request to the department to which we will return just now.

We all know that the transition in local government has been a  particularly
complex matter. We have eight years of the  pre-transition,  the  transition
itself  and  the  first  18  months  of   the   final   phase   behind   us.
Notwithstanding this, we are still nowhere near the end of this period.  The
journey goes ahead and there are those who say that we are at the  beginning
of the journey or the beginning of the end or  the  end  of  the  beginning.
Either way, there are another 10 or 15 years ahead of us.

The reason for  the  complexity  is  simply  that  local  government  offers
particular challenges that are not really  those  of  the  national  or  the
provincial sphere. In particular, we have 284 municipalities which  vary  to
such an extent that there are those which cannot  even  pay  for  their  own
councillors and those which have budgets and  capacity  equal  to,  or  even
greater than, in some instances, certain provinces.

The whole issue of the transition is extremely  complex.  In  commenting  on
this, I wanted to start with a proposition that we, as MPs  and  members  of
the  portfolio  committee  and  people  who  are  passionate   about   local
government, find ourselves at  a  serious  disadvantage  in  discussing  the
issue. The fact of the matter is that we are  simply  inadequately  informed
of what is going on in local government. This is not  to  suggest  that  the
department is denying us information or has been unco-operative in any  way.
Far from it. We are bombarded with tons of paper.

The fact of the matter is that, if one looks from  a  holistic  perspective,
we do not really have an adequate handle  on  what  is  going  on  in  local
government at present. The IFP believes there is a need for  the  department
to assist us by developing a holistic and simple  targeted  appreciation  of
what is going on in local government. There is a dire need for  a  regularly
updated, probably annual, comprehensive overview of the  status  quo,  which
should point to all the general trends as well  as  give  us  the  empirical
data upon which those trends are being tabulated. As far as we know, such  a
document or even a process does not exist. We are aware of  the  report  and
we will thank the Minister for giving it to us today  -  something  that  we
had been wanting for some time - and there is  another  report  also  tabled
today for the first report. That is precisely the kind of  information  that
we want and have not had the advantage of to date. Be  that  as  it  may,  I
think that the review we are referring to is a bit broader.  Maybe  I  could
refer to some of the issues in it.

First, I think, is the section  reviewing  the  implementation  difficulties
faced by municipalities after the 2000 election. These include  things  like
establishment  matters,  finance  and  capacity.  If  one   looks   at   the
establishment matters, it might appear self-evident to all  of  us  that  18
months after the elections, the establishment processes are  in  fact  over.
This  is  not  necessarily  the  case.  Indeed,  in  terms  of  the  initial
establishment, we would want to ascertain from the department  whether  this
is so. I know, for example, of several municipalities where, as  far  as  we
are concerned, there are still transfers of staff and assets  taking  place.
How widespread is this problem? We have no idea  at  present.  How  far  are
municipalities in  establishing  their  staff  components,  particularly  in
respect of municipal heads of department? Have these outstanding  issues  of
the establishment had consequences in respect of delivery?  These  are  some
of the questions we would want answered by the department  in  a  review  of
this kind.

Parliament approved a reasonably significant  transition  budget  to  assist
municipalities in the once-off costs associated with  implementing  the  new
system. The financial challenges facing new  municipalities  go  way  beyond
the immediate cost of the implementation of the new  system.  In  the  first
instance, we need to know how that budget  was  used.  Beyond  that,  though
there is indeed a support programme  supporting  something  like  a  hundred
municipalities that are designated by the department  as  being  in  crisis,
there  are  nonetheless  many  other  municipalities  that  are  financially
troubled. The review should clearly identify the nature and extent of  these
financial  problems  and  the  suggested  remedies.  We  do  appreciate  the
Minister's input at the budget hearing to  the  effect  that  Government  is
addressing a revised programme of support for local government.  We  as  MPs
as yet have no idea what this comprises or even the extent of  the  problem.
It is important that we understand what Government has been doing to  assist
municipalities in financial distress and what it still intends doing.

Beyond  the  issues  of  financial  distress  and  numerous  other   matters
financial, there is a basic problem which we really have not  got  to  grips
with yet, and that is whether our municipalities are all financially  viable
in the first place and what viability actually means in practice.  There  is
the issue which has been raised by many people, namely the  R22  billion  in
outstanding arrears. There  is  the  issue  of  financing  delivery  to  the
indigent. All these matters should be part of a local government review.

Another burning issue of immediate transition is that of  capacity.  We  are
not really sure whether the Government has a sound grip on how  serious  the
problem is. From a remedial perspective, capacity constraints are linked  to
training programmes. Although we do have some sort of  picture  as  to  what
the training programmes comprise, we find the picture rather grainy. We  are
not really sure of the extent to which  the  Seta  and  councillor  training
programmes are addressing the problem.

If one, for example, gives some thought to the  IDP  process  last  year  at
least, or maybe even at the beginning of this year, there is clearly a  wide
disjuncture between what is intended in terms of an  integrated  IDP  public
participation budget process and what in fact has been happening in  reality
in terms of consultants drafting things and getting them  rubber-stamped  by
councils.
We do  appreciate  the  department's  role,  last  year  in  particular,  in
developing interim IDPs, but a  year  later,  we  must  really  ask  whether
councils have been weaned from Pretoria's breast as yet or whether they  are
still in fact at a stage that requires substantial support.

In assessing the current state of affairs in local  government,  the  review
should also deal with the manner in which municipalities are  giving  effect
to the statutory requirements of the structures Act and the systems  Act  in
particular. Here particularly I  think  the  starting  point  would  be  the
manner in which the Minister is giving effect to the  requirements  we  gave
in the systems Act that he be entitled to utilise the phasing-in powers  for
all the different municipalities, to allow a  differentiated  implementation
of what are really fairly sophisticated provisions in the  law.  The  matter
is, in fact,  well  advanced  and  it  has  actually  been  through  to  the
President.

For us as members of the committee and MPs who are completely  out  on  that
loop, one of the most burning issues is, of course, the finalisation of  the
powers and functions of district municipalities  and  local  municipalities.
This again is an issue which preoccupied many of us for a long time, and  we
welcome the assurance of the Minister that the issue has been  put  to  rest
eventually. Given that the status quo was amended by the  structures  Act  -
that amendment  was  there  precisely  to  minimise  disruption  to  service
delivery - the question that does remain, given the fact that this issue  is
being reviewed again, is: What effect  will  this  have  again  on  budgets,
planning and transformation and ultimately on delivery? Is this  information
readily to hand for all  stakeholders  and  Government  departments  brought
into the proposed solution that we hear? We hear there is  a  soft  solution
but we are waiting for the  finalisation  of  the  hard  solution.  We  also
understand that this issue is linked to the funding  of  district  councils.
That solution has been outstanding since 1996, to be fair. There is a  whole
package of things we need some clarity on.

Part of the problem is that the department is doing a great deal. We  simply
do not know what they are doing. There are two  aspects  here:  One  is  the
policy side. We  understand  that  there  is  a  draft  policy  on  capacity
building. There is progress between  the  department  and  the  Treasury  on
intervention mechanisms. There is a framework on the implementation  of  the
systems Act. There is a fiscal powers framework. There have  even  been  two
status quo reports. In fact, we got them today for the first  time.  I  want
to thank the Minister for those.

Then there is another aspect, and that is the  issue  of  research  and  the
empirical data underpinning the policy  issues.  We  really  feel  that  the
approach of the department to date  appears  to  be  that  the  research  is
conducted and policy processes are undertaken, and  until  Cabinet  approves
something, everything is sort of secret service. We are not allowed to  have
access to anything. We would really take issue with the department  on  this
and want to engage the  department  on  releasing  the  empirical  data  and
bringing the committee in on the policy formulation process a  lot  earlier.
What happens is that we simply get things at the end of the process.

By way of conclusion I want to  emphasise  that  there  are  numerous  other
matters that should be addressed in the type of transformation  review  that
we are talking about here. There  is  the  whole  electricity  restructuring
saga. My colleague before me made reference to that. There are  problems  of
governance and cross-boundary  municipalities.  There  is  the  success  and
failure of local economic development strategies and the  roll-out  of  free
basic services, especially in  the  rural  areas.  There  is  the  community
participation in local governance and ward  committee  problems.  There  are
the improvements in the IDP process - the Minister has mentioned some -  the
implementation of stricter credit  controls  and  the  finalisation  of  the
traditional leaders governance issues. There are a lot of things  and  there
are many more that I can mention that should be incorporated into  the  kind
of review we are referring to. The Minister noted in  his  2001  address  to
this House in fact that:
  The challenge in the  next  two  or  three  years  is  to  stabilise  and
  consolidate the system of local government.

We agreed with that. It is a great idea. The problem that we  have  is  that
we would like to believe that Government is doing all it can to give  effect
to that. We simply do not know what it is  doing  until  it  is  simply  too
late. We have urged the Ministry to give thought  to  the  proposal  we  are
making and that the portfolio committee  engage  more  thoroughly  with  the
department in respect of interrogating the issues raised by such a report.

Rev A D GOOSEN: Chair, I will be speaking  on  intergovernmental  relations,
or IGR. I start by saying that our Constitution makes provision for a three-
sphere  system  of   government   with   distinctive,   interdependent   and
interrelated elements. Moving away from the previous notion of tiers  was  a
conscious attempt to do  away  with  a  hierarchical  system  that  had  the
connotation  of  subordination.  However,  in  practice,  the   hierarchical
approach is still evident in many areas. This is understandable. Over  time,
provincial as well as local government has to be empowered.

An important lesson we can learn from the Spanish system  of  government  is
that  they  also  assign  competencies  from  central  government  to  other
spheres, in much the same way as our Constitution allows. The devolution  of
competencies in Spain is part of a gradual  process  in  which  spheres  are
allowed to be developed over time. Although both spheres still  need  to  be
nurtured, they must nevertheless be allowed to develop on their own.

The main objective  of  the  system  of  intergovernment  relations  is  co-
operation for effective  service  delivery.  If  the  IGR  system  does  not
address how the spheres can co-operate for effective service delivery,  then
it has no value in our system of governance and therefore has  no  right  to
exist.  The  department  has  undertaken  to  draft  legislation  that  will
regulate intergovernmental relations  as  required  by  section  41  of  the
Constitution. This is welcome news and we hope that  this  legislation  will
facilitate effective intergovernmental relations and will add value  to  the
system of co-operative governance.

These principles include transparent, accountable  and  coherent  government
with each sphere exercising powers and functions in a manner that  does  not
encroach on the geographical,  functional  and  institutional  integrity  of
another sphere. The Constitution is not prescriptive on  matters  pertaining
to IGR but rather provides a framework within which  the  three  spheres  of
government need to co-operate.

The local government legislative framework, which has been inactive so  far,
from the process of redemarcating the  municipal  boundaries  to  the  Local
Government:  Municipal  Systems  Act,  passed  last  year,  has  created  an
environment within which  intergovernmental  relations  can  be  effectively
implemented. The integrated development planning processes create space  for
all spheres  of  government  to  co-operate  in  the  interests  of  service
delivery. The department hopes to finalise intergovernmental guidelines  for
integrated development planning in March 2003.

These guidelines come at an opportune time because most municipalities  have
completed  their  IDPs  and  these  have  been  submitted  to  the  relevant
provinces for scrutiny and also to meet with the requirements as set out  in
the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act. This Act  extends  co-operative
governance even  to  communities.  Legislation  further  creates  space  for
partnerships for service provision within the private sector.

I need to stress that having a good  legislative  framework,  however,  does
not mean automatic service delivery in  an  effective  manner.  Capacity  to
deliver  remains  the  key.  This  is  the  main  challenge  for   the   new
municipalities and the systems that  came  into  effect  in  December  2000.
Local government cannot effect service delivery on its own, but  needs  both
national and provincial governments to play a role.  To  set  its  goals  it
also needs private enterprise.

The section 41 legislation will hopefully give clear  guidance  on  what  it
means practically for provincial and national governments to  support  local
government. At the moment it seems unclear, and this is to the  disadvantage
of service delivery.

Although  we  have  succeeded  in  covering  some  ground  with  regard   to
intergovernmental relations, we still need to put in  a  lot  of  effort  in
order to secure  our  ultimate  goal  of  effective  delivery,  as  this  is
essentially what IGR should be about. It  is  not  an  end  in  itself,  but
rather a means to an end. This is precisely what section 41 is referring  to
when it states that an Act of  Parliament  must  establish  or  provide  for
structures and institutions  to  promote  and  facilitate  intergovernmental
relations.

We need to appreciate that there are already a number  of  intergovernmental
structures that have been instituted to promote and facilitate  co-operative
governance and intergovernmental relations between the  respective  spheres.
The  role  and  place  of  local  government  -  and,  in  this  case,   the
intergovernmental structures - will need to be clarified by the  section  41
legislation that the department hopes to introduce this year.

The role and guidance of organised local government, in this case Salga,  in
defining the role and place of local government  within  the  structures  of
intergovernmental relations is very critical.  Salga  has  a  constitutional
mandate to facilitate support for local government and to especially play  a
role in Government's intergovernmental  framework,  so  as  to  enhance  co-
operative governance.

Once the department has put in place  the  framework  for  intergovernmental
relations, intergovernmental programmes, such as the Integrated  Sustainable
Rural Development Strategy and the Urban Renewal  Programme,  will  be  more
efficiently executed, and  this  will  contribute  to  a  larger  degree  to
accelerated service delivery.

I want to make special mention of the role of the  NCOP,  not  only  as  the
second House of Parliament but also as a vehicle towards  greater  cohesion.
It goes without saying that the NCOP  does  have  much  greater  interaction
with provinces than  does  the  National  Assembly.  Matters  of  provincial
importance, as well as issues pertaining  to  local  government,  should  be
brought to the attention of the NCOP, which needs to act on  them.  If  this
were the case, it would be beneficial for provinces  and  local  government.
In fact, this would be co-operative governance at its best.

In the week of 27 May the NCOP visited the provinces, and delegates  visited
the nodes in their provinces for the purpose of  monitoring  progress.  This
was a typical intergovernmental relations exercise, because  the  provincial
delegates to the NCOP were interacting with local  government.  This  surely
gave the NCOP an opportunity to understand issues at local government  level
and in the provinces. This then places the NCOP  in  a  unique  position  to
contribute to service delivery and strengthen  co-operative  governance.  We
must never lose sight  of  the  vital  role  that  the  NCOP  must  play  in
corporate governance. [Time expired.] [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mnr P UYS: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb  Minister,  agb  Adjunkminister,  in  die
begrotingspos vir Plaaslike en Provinsiale Regering is 'n  bedrag  van  R6,3
miljard  toegeken  vir  die  2002-03  finansiële  jaar,  met   'n   verwagte
uitgawebegroting van R7,8 miljard in 2003-04 en R8,4 miljard in  jaar  2004-
05. Hierdie toename in die uitgawe is noodsaaklik om die  transformasie  van
plaaslike regering  te  ondersteun.  Besondere  klem  word  geplaas  op  die
infrastruktuur van behoeftes wat lei tot noemenswaardige verhogings  in  die
toekenning aan  die  gekonsolideerde  infrastruktuurprogram,  wat  styg  met
34,4% oor die volgende drie jaar.

Die verhoging in die begrotingstoekenning, in  die  besonder  vir  plaaslike
regering, word verwelkom.  Hierdie  finansiële  jaar,  in  teenstelling  met
vorige jare, sal distriksmunisipaliteite ook van  die  billike  deel  fondse
ontvang. Dit word verwelkom.

Van  die  uitdagings  wat  die  Ministerie  en  die  departement  saam   met
provinsies en plaaslike regering sal moet aanspreek, sluit  onder  meer  die
volgende in. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P UYS: Mr Chairman, hon Minister, hon Deputy  Minister,  in  the  Budget
Vote for Local and Provincial Government an amount of R3,6 billion has  been
allocated for the 2002-03  financial  year,  with  an  expected  expenditure
budget of R7,8 billion in 2003-04 and R8,4  billion  in  the  year  2004-05.
This increase in expenditure is imperative to support the transformation  of
local government. Exceptional emphasis is placed on  the  infrastructure  of
needs  that  leads  to  noteworthy  increases  in  the  allocation  to   the
consolidated infrastructure programmes, that in the next  three  years  will
increase by 34,4%.

The increase in the budget allocation, especially to  local  government,  is
welcomed. This financial year,  in  contrast  to  previous  years,  district
municipalities will also  receive  a  fair  share  of  the  funds.  This  is
welcomed.

The challenges that the Ministry and the department will have to address  in
conjunction with the provinces and  local  government  will  include,  inter
alia, the following.]

I would like to refer to four of the more important  challenges.  The  first
is ensuring sustainable development. Any government activity  must  be  able
to answer some of the following questions positively: Does  the  service  or
activity contribute to breaking down  social  divisions?  Does  it  help  to
foster dignity and build leadership? Does it provide  support  to  the  poor
and  contribute  to  skills  development?  Government  must  thus  use   its
procurement policies and its influence as a major  purchaser  of  goods  and
services  to  maximise  job  creation,  skills  development   and   economic
empowerment.

The second challenge is  partnerships.  Municipalities  need  to  work  with
provincial  and  national  government,  especially  in  areas  where   their
functions overlap, in much more effective ways than is currently  the  case.
A key task  in  the  partnership  approach  is  empowering  communities  and
community organisations to engage effectively  in  the  development  process
and to address community needs.

Ward  committees  appear  to  have  experienced   more   difficulties   than
subcouncils in getting off  the  ground.  These  difficulties  have  largely
flowed  from  the  method  chosen  to  elect  ward  committees,  with   some
municipalities  conducting  full-blown  ward-wide   elections   and   others
electing their committees at ward public meetings.

Municipalities which are establishing ward committees are  not  finding  the
process easy. There is no clarity about what they need to do  to  constitute
ward committees. How do they put them together? How do  they  structure  and
organise them? How do they empower community institutions and  residents  to
participate in them? The hon the Minister and  his  department  can  play  a
very important role here, and I welcome his announcement that there will  be
capacity-building specifically around  the  ward  committees  and  community
empowerment.

The third challenge is best value services. The  primary  responsibility  of
municipalities must  still  be  to  ensure  the  provision  of  high-quality
municipal services to both  the  residents  and  commercial  and  industrial
enterprises. Municipal policies  must  always  be  aimed  at  ensuring  that
services are affordable to poor households, taking into  consideration  that
all citizens should have access to a guaranteed package  of  services  which
is in line with applicable national standards  and  which  should  at  least
include water and sanitation, electricity,  refuse  removal  and  access  to
their residences.

The merging of the  two  programmes  of  CMIP,  the  Consolidated  Municipal
Infrastructure Programme, and the Local Economic Development Fund so  as  to
have a  co-ordinated  approach  is  welcome.  The  allocation  to  CMIP  has
increased from R1 billion to R1,7 billion this year,  an  increase  of  71%.
The LED Fund has funded 186 projects to the value  of  R186  million  and  I
congratulate the Minister on that. The department  has  identified  over  80
new projects for the 2002-03 financial year and allocated R99 million.

The fourth challenge I would like to refer to is  financial  sustainability.
Municipal reserves have declined significantly over recent years.  There  is
also uncertainty  regarding  the  future  of  a  number  of  income  streams
including electricity surpluses and the  RSC  levy,  which  are  potentially
subject to national change. Ensuring financial sustainability  will  require
from  all  spheres  of  government  a  range  of  proactive  measures   that
substantially increase the financial strength of  municipalities,  including
maintaining and expanding income streams through maintaining  the  integrity
of the rates base, improving credit control and securing additional  sources
of finance.

The pro-poor policy aimed at indigent households must be adopted  throughout
all municipalities. This policy must ensure that subsidies reach the  people
who need them and that the  unnecessary  hidden  subsidies  are  eliminated.
Here the department can play a very important role in guiding  and  building
the capacity of local government.

Groot uitdagings  wag  op  die  Minister  en  sy  adjunkminister  en  op  sy
departement. Die transformasie van plaaslike regering sal  hierdie  jaar  'n
verdere stap vorentoe gevat moet word. Ek weet dit sal gedoen  word.  Sekere
sleutelposte sal so gou doenlik in die departement gevul moet  word  om  reg
te laat geskied aan die implementering van die begrotingsplanne.

Aan   die   Minister,   die   adjunkminister,   die   voorsitter   van   die
portefeuljekomitee en die lede van die komitee - en in die besonder ook  aan
Llewellyn  Brown  -  en  die  amptenare  wil  ek  baie  dankie  sê  vir  die
ondersteuning. Die Nuwe NP  wens  die  Minister  geluk  met  'n  baie  goeie
begroting en ondersteun dit  graag.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Major challenges await  the  Minister  and  his  Deputy  Minister  and  his
department. The transformation of local government will have to be  taken  a
step forward this year. I know it will be done. Certain  key  posts  in  his
department will have to be filled as soon as possible to do justice  to  the
implementation of the budget plans.

To the Minister, the Deputy  Minister,  the  chairperson  of  the  portfolio
committee and the  members  of  the  committee  -  and  also  especially  to
Llewellyn Brown - and the officials I want to extend  my  deepest  gratitude
for their support. The New NP congratulates the  Minister  on  a  very  good
budget and gladly supports it. [Applause.]]

Mr B M SOLO: Chairperson,  hon  Minister  S  Mufamadi  and  Deputy  Minister
Comrade N Botha, hon members of Parliament and  Deputy  Chairperson,  a  lot
has already been said about the budget. I will avoid  repetition.  My  input
is on the system of provincial government, which,  of  course,  is  part  of
intergovernmental relations.

Under Vote 5, the department states that its aim is:


  To develop and promote a national system of co-operative governance;  and
  to support the development of provincial and local government.

It goes further to list key  objectives  and  programmes.  One  of  the  key
objectives is:


  To strengthen the institutions of provincial and local government ...  as
  well  as  intergovernmental   relations,   through   appropriate   policy
  interventions, the development of planning and implementation tools,  and
  capacity-building.

This, in essence, means the need  to  strengthen  the  country's  system  of
intergovernmental relations. This process has begun with  local  government,
where we see local government stabilising and maturing, particularly  within
matters of development. In  this  Budget  Vote,  we  note  the  department's
emphasis on  integrated  governance  to  ensure  improvements  in  planning,
service delivery and development in all spheres of government. This we  find
to  be  very  important  to  consolidate  and  strengthen  systems  of  good
governance, particularly at provincial level.

As such, the department has the task to ensure that certain  tasks  provided
for by the Constitution are carried out. A lot has indeed been done  at  the
level of local government, in terms of both policy  and  legislation.  There
are still a lot of challenges at the level of provincial  government.  These
challenges revolve around  the  provision  of  services  through  provincial
structures, provincial competencies and cross-boundary  municipalities.  Our
focus, therefore, should be directed at  improving  our  strategies  to  the
extent that we are able to meet such challenges. This can  be  achieved,  if
we develop  systems  and  mechanisms  that  can  ensure  the  effective  and
efficient delivery of services.

The national  Government  is  responsible  for  functions  that  cut  across
provincial boundaries. These include, but are  not  limited  to,  protection
services, economic services and foreign affairs. However,  there  are  other
services that are concurrent, but fall  within  the  province's  competence,
and these include social security grants,  housing,  education,  health  and
safety and security.

Whilst this is so, national Government  retains  responsibility  for  policy
development, co-ordinating national mandates, monitoring and  implementation
within concurrent functions.

For all these to be achieved, the department has to develop basic norms  and
standards for all spheres of government. As such, appropriate  consideration
should be given to reviewing the boundaries of provinces in  order  to  deal
with the difficulties posed by cross-boundary municipalities,  for  example,
in the Tshwane metropolitan council and the Nkungwini local municipality  in
the Metsiding district municipality.

The department has committed itself, as part of its programmes,  to  support
provinces and manage the interface between good governance  and  sustainable
development. We would therefore like to see the department  play  an  active
role in providing the relevant support, particularly to provinces  that  are
more rural.

The department needs to examine the capacity of provinces and  assist  those
provinces that have difficulty meeting  their  obligations.  We  should  not
pretend that all is well and good. We are not suggesting  interference  with
the  autonomy  of  provinces,  but  that  issues  of  national   importance,
particularly service delivery to the poor, should receive priority.

One issue that does not seem to be coming out clearly is around the area  of
information sharing, co-ordination, monitoring and implementation. I  am  of
the view that significant attention should  be  given  to  this  aspect.  We
cannot allow the deepening of inequality, with our people living in poor  or
underdeveloped provinces. Systems should be developed to  ensure  innovation
of capacity and  resources  so  that  we  can  be  assured  that  all  South
Africans, irrespective of  their  geographical  situation,  have  access  to
basic services.
According  to  the  Division  of  Revenue  Act  of   2002   the   provincial
infrastructure grant grew from R800 million to R2,9 billion in  the  2004-05
Budget.

The department transfers two  grants  to  provinces,  and  these  are  local
government   capacity-building   grants   aimed   at   supporting    smaller
municipalities, and the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme.

In  essence,  Government  provides  the  necessary  financial  resources  to
provinces to execute their constitutional obligations. We  need  to  examine
the constraints for the seemingly slow delivery.

Ngalesi sabelo sezimali uHulumeni uzama ukusiza  ohulumeni  bezifunda  kanye
nohulumeni basemakhaya ukuze babonakale bebambe  iqhaza  elikhulu  ohlelweni
lokusiza,  ikakhulukazi  abantu  bakithi  abadla  imbuya   ngothi   ngokuthi
uHulumeni aphinde enyuse izinga lomnotho, aqede nokwentuleka komsebenzi.

Okunye okwenziwa yilo Hulumeni wethu uhlelo lokufeza izimfuno  zokwelekelela
umphakathi nokwenza  ngcono  ezenhlalakahle  ngomgomo  wohlelo  lukaHulumeni

Uma kungadaleka imisebenzi, izakhamizi zaseMzansi Afrika  yonkana  ziyokwazi
ukusizana futhi zilwe nobugebengu  bese  sisebenzela  impilo  engcono  yethu
sonke. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Through this budget, the Government is  trying  to  assist  provincial  and
local governments so that they can play a major role in  creating  assisting
programmes, especially for our people who are poor. This  will  be  achieved
if the Government increases the economic levels and abolishes unemployment.

Another thing that our Government has  created  is  a  programme  that  will
fulfil the needs; that will assist communities and improve health through  a
Government programme aimed at decreasing poverty and creating jobs. If  jobs
can be created, South African citizens will be able to  assist  one  another
and fight crime. From that point on we will all fight for a better life  for
all.]

We are looking forward to the formulation  of  legislation  that  will  give
better clarity on  principles  of  co-operative  governance,  definition  of
procedures, systems and  other  issues,  including  the  whole  question  of
intercommunication, to ensure uniformity, which will help us.

Njengoba sakhe amazinga amathathu  kuHulumeni,  abasemakhaya,  abezifundazwe
nohulumeni ophezulu sizama ukuthi kube khona indlela yokusebenzisana.  Kodwa
asiphakamisi  ukuthi  senze  amavila  amathathu,  u-angazi,  akusiyimi   no-
angikhathali. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[Since we created three levels of  government,  the  local,  provincial  and
national levels, we have been trying to find a  way  of  co-operating  among
ourselves. We were not trying to create three levels of laziness, the `I  do
not know', `it's not me' and `I do not care'.]

We need to do things in a different  way  as  responsible,  patriotic  South
Africans. We need to move one step further and lend a  hand,  not  only  for
salaries, but to ensure the creation of a caring  society  so  that  we  are
able to push back the frontiers of poverty, as the President stated. At  the
end of the day what we are doing is to help ``lift  from  the  shoulders  of
our people the intolerable burden  of  poverty  and  underdevelopment'',  to
quote the President.

Ms R M SOUTHGATE: Chairperson, hon Minister,  the  strategic  objectives  of
the transformation process of local government will never be  realised.  The
fact that the crossing of the floor will be taking place  during  its  five-
year term makes it a difficult task  for  municipalities  to  stabilise  and
consolidate.

The high rate of arrears  and  debt  aside;  inefficient  services  and  the
nondelivery of services  make  local  government  unsustainable.  Integrated
development programmes that have been set in place  in  some  municipalities
will probably be changed owing to this legislation, and new  plans  will  be
drawn up, causing longer delays and frustrating communities further.
A primary role of local government  is  to  enable  communities  to  achieve
their objectives. Leadership capacity and  community  partnerships  are  key
factors  for  building  local  infrastructure.  Effective  local  government
exerts the right influence on the social  and  economic  dimensions  of  its
surrounding communities.

The budget for local government will enjoy a real increase of  24%  and  39%
over the 2002-03 and 2003-04 financial years. The  focus  of  Government  is
thus, clearly, on enhancing the capacity of local community services.

Why is it, then, that still too many communities do not enjoy  the  benefits
from central  Government's  budgetary  allocations?  The  problem  must  lie
somewhere in the manner in which the budget process works.

The authorisation of the powers and functions of local government  is  still
too weak to effect meaningful negotiations on the  terms  of  its  budgetary
requirements. The local sphere of government is still  too  reliant  on  the
policy dictates of  higher  spheres  of  government  on  how  to  run  local
affairs.

It is the task of  local  authorities  to  take  moral  ownership  of  their
obligation to govern in the interest of their communities.  In  this  regard
we hope that the national  Infrastructure  Investment  Framework  will  help
towards developing an appropriate strategy  to  identify  and  address  such
problems.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking  time
has expired.

Ms R M SOUTHGATE: The  combined  influence  of  the  Consolidated  Municipal
Infrastructure Programme and the Local Economic Development  programme  will
be responsible for developing these appropriate strategies  and  programmes.
[Time expired.]

[Ms M C LOBE: Chairperson, this debate  takes  place  at  a  time  when  our
people are enjoying the benefits of  the  Government's  programme  of  doing
away with boundaries which were developed in accordance with  discrimination
in terms of colour. I am proud to say that  people  are  benefiting  because
right now local government boundaries have brought people together from  all
racial groups under one administration and the same source of  finance,  and
the same management in providing  essential  services.  The  most  important
thing is that this administration has a very crucial role  to  play  in  the
process  of  speeding  up  transformation  in  places  which  the  apartheid
government didn't bother to develop.

I am talking about places such as Botshabelo, Motse-Thabong  and  so  forth,
where the chaos of the tyrant government is evident. On  10  July  2002  the
Mangaung local government in the Free State was assessing the  budget.  This
happened after research was conducted within the community, seeking  to  get
the people's opinion on the IDP programme. This shows  very  well  that  the
local  government  is  working  in  harmony  with  the  community.   Nothing
separates them. A Sesotho  idiomatic  expression  says:  ``  ntjapedi  ha  e
hlolwe ke sebata'', ie any job can be done perfectly by a  team  of  people,
working together in harmony.

I would like to take this opportunity to  congratulate  Mangaung  on  a  job
well done. And now I can see the reason for the  Department  of  Finance  to
have chosen Mangaung as one of  those  municipalities  that  understand  and
manage their finances accordingly. I further congratulate  them  for  having
won the prize for  cleanliness  in  the  Free  State  province.  Well  done,
Mangaung, keep it up! [Applause.]

I congratulate them so much, and I appreciate the fact that it is not  quite
true that local governments are faced with a financial  crisis  to  such  an
extent  that  they  are  perceived  to  be  incompetent  in  managing  their
finances.]

The  success  of  the  new  system  of  local  government  depends  on   the
fundamental review of the local government financial system, which  includes
the fiscal powers and functions of district and  local  municipalities,  the
local government  equitable  share  of  national  revenue,  property  rates,
intergovernmental grants and other sources of revenue.

We welcome the ongoing process of consolidating the grant stream into a  few
simplified and rationalised grants. These grants will be divided into  three
clusters, namely the equitable  share  grant,  the  capital  grant  and  the
capacity-building and restructuring grant. These reforms will not only  make
the grant system more understandable to users  and  stakeholders,  but  will
also lower compliance and administration costs,  thereby  allowing  managers
and administrators to concentrate their efforts on accelerating delivery.

At the moment grants to municipalities have been  allocated  on  a  one-year
basis. Of course, municipalities are notified of their grant closer  to  the
start of the financial year. There is still  not  enough  predictability  in
the flow of grants, which makes it difficult to  enhance  project  planning.
Clearly, there is a need to give municipalities a three-year  allocation  to
accommodate some of these issues.

The introduction of an output approach to defining the purpose  of  a  grant
and assessing municipalities' performance in spending the grant is  in  line
with the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act.  For  example,  a  capital
grant's output can be defined by setting targets on a number of  indicators,
such as infrastructure, etc. This approach  will  give  municipalities  more
discretion in spending their grant,  thereby  allowing  for  more  effective
spending. Most of these issues are comprehensively  captured  in  the  Local
Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill, which  is  before  Parliament
now.

We also appreciate the increase  in  the  local  government  transfers.  The
financial year 2002-03 sees the continuation of a trend started in  2001-02,
of a sizeable increase in the amounts  transferred  to  municipalities  from
the previous year's allocation and from previous MTEF baseline allocations.
If we compare the increases in the sphere's allocation from  the  nationally
collected revenue from the revised Budget for  2001-02,  it  is  clear  that
local government's total share is increasing at  a  much  faster  rate  than
that of other spheres. However, it must be noted that the provision of  free
basic services is now linked to the  equitable  share  and,  therefore,  the
increase in this regard is, clearly, linked to this important issue.

During last year's budget debate we raised a concern around the gap  in  the
salaries and allowances  of  full-time  and  part-time  councillors.  Whilst
acknowledging the effort by the department  to  close  this  gap,  we  feel,
however, that there is a need to review this issue, taking into account  the
fact that the majority of ward councillors work on  a  part-time  basis  and
are expected to service vast wards, especially  those  in  rural  areas.  We
must develop  mechanisms  for  supporting  councillors  in  executing  their
responsibilities. I hope the Minister will be able to address some of  these
issues.

[The status of financial management at local government level  has  improved
tremendously. There is promising progress. But we still have  to  make  sure
that we support and co-operate with this division of government with  regard
to the renewal of financial resources. Chairperson, allow  me  to  use  this
opportunity to thank the local governments for  the  ongoing  service  which
they provide to the citizens of South Africa, more especially when  we  look
at the challenges with which they are faced pertaining  to  the  eradication
of poverty and the speeding up of the changes which  will  ensure  a  better
life for all. I would like to say to  South  African  citizens  that  it  is
always easy for a person who has  never  experienced  the  pain  of  walking
around barefoot, sleeping on an empty stomach, having no money  -  not  even
enough to buy a loaf of bread - to speak as the hon Gloria is speaking  now.
It is because she doesn't understand the theory of a  person  who  does  not
even have money to buy bread, having money to do all these things  of  which
she has already spoken, ie being able to pay for services and so forth.

I would like to ask her that in future, when she talks about  the  issue  of
not paying for services, she must treat  it  in  conjunction  with  poverty,
which is not the problem of the majority party only. It is a  problem  which
faces all of us, as public servants here at Parliament.

I would like to stop right here, because I am aware now that on  hearing  me
uttering these words, little mice are beginning to peep through their  holes
out of curiosity. And, of course, it is not  wise  to  be  monotonous;  more
will follow on this issue in due course. I thank you. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson,
Comrade Minister, members of Parliament, comrades and friends, I joined  the
Ministry of Provincial and Local Government about a year ago.

At the time, the new system of local government was  only  six  months  old.
Municipalities had new boundaries, a completely new  system  to  deal  with,
and, moreover, the councillors were also new to the system.  The  department
itself was in the process of restructuring, and was understaffed - about  60
vacancies still had to be filled.  The  department  and  the  Ministry  have
since embarked on a process to better  integrate  their  work  and  adopt  a
common team-based approach to tackling the mandate of the Ministry  and  the
Department of Provincial and Local Government.

During this challenging period, Cabinet further tasked the  department  with
responsibility for the Integrated Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme
and the Urban Renewal Programme, necessitating, even more  importantly,  the
integration imperative.

The department has done a lot of  commendable  work  and  hon  members  have
probably heard this from previous speakers as well. But  the  key  challenge
now is to focus in a particular direction. Keeping  focus  therefore  during
this period of transition and transformation means reconnecting  firmly  the
primary mandate of the department, which is derived from  our  Constitution,
legislation and Cabinet decisions.

Specifically, therefore, the mandate of the department  is  to  develop  and
monitor the implementation of national policy, legislation  and  regulations
in functional areas which affect provincial and local government  and  which
affect  traditional  leadership,  seeking  to   transform   and   strengthen
institutions of governance to fulfil their developmental role; secondly,  to
develop, promote and monitor mechanisms, systems and  structures  to  enable
integrated service delivery within  Government;  and,  thirdly,  to  promote
sustainable  development  by  providing  support  to  provincial  and  local
government.

The strategic plan of the department operationalises this  mandate  for  the
MTEF for the peroid 2002-05. This plan is informed  by  various  resolutions
taken by Cabinet, including  the  Cabinet  lekgotla  of  January  2002,  the
President's state of the nation address of this year,  as  well  as  various
resolutions adopted by the President's Co-ordinating Council.

The primary  orientation  of  the  strategic  plan  is  the  adoption  of  a
proactive approach to working with provinces and municipalities, which  will
entail providing them with direct support in all areas of need.

The portfolio committee  in  its  report  states  that  the  strategic  plan
provides a clearer form and structure for  the  department's  programme  and
activities for the  committee's  oversight  role.  The  committee,  however,
feels that the strategic plan needs  to  be  more  specific,  especially  in
terms of measurable objectives and outputs.

The plan  should  also  be  more  explicit  on  how  the  department's  work
contributes to the key goals of Government as a  whole,  including  economic
growth, job creation, development and redistribution. We view this  critique
in a constructive manner, and we will definitely work towards improving it.

To complement this orientation, the department has gone  further  to  create
partnerships  with  external  stakeholders  in  order  to   strengthen   our
programmes.  Our  department   continues   to   promote   partnerships   for
development. Government, civil society, the private sector  and  communities
need to work together to promote and bring  about  sustainable  development.
In this way, enduring partnerships have developed.

As an example, many organisations and institutions are  currently  providing
support to the Ministry and  the  department.  Some  of  these  institutions
include the EU, the GTZ, the Independent Trust - IDT -  the  Department  for
International Development of the UK, the Netherlands government,  the  CSIR,
Epa Development (Pty) Ltd,  various  academic  institutions  and  the  World
Bank. Some of these organisations have seconded specialists and  experts  to
the department. We would like to thank all  these  organisations  for  their
continued assistance and support.

The strategic plan puts a special emphasis on three key focus areas,  namely
integrated  governance,  provincial  and  local  government   support,   and
strengthening the corporate capacity of the department. For the  department,
integrated  governance  is  specifically  focused   on   strengthening   the
relationships between  the  various  spheres  of  government,  primarily  to
promote the objective of developmental local government.

This represents a new style of governing  that  consciously  involves  civil
society   partners,   communities,   the   private   sector   and   relevant
stakeholders. The branch we call  Governance  and  Development  is  uniquely
positioned to  give  effect  to  this  key  focus  area.  Some  of  the  key
programmes managed by this branch within the department are  the  Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Programme, the Urban  Renewal  Programme,  the
local economic development programme, the CMIP - the Consolidated  Municipal
Infrastructure Programme - the  Integrated  Development  Planning  programme
and the municipal service partnership.

The second key  focus  area  centres  on  the  strengthening  of  provincial
governments and consolidating the transformation of local  government.  This
is crucial to improving service delivery and sustainable  development.  This
branch,  called  Institutional  Reform   and   Support,   is   directed   at
facilitating the fulfilment of the objectives of this key focus area.

Key programmes managed by this branch include  capacity-building  for  local
government, disaster management,  local  government  performance  management
and local government equitable share. With particular reference to  disaster
management,  a  number  of  activities  are  being  undertaken.  A  National
Disaster  Management  Centre  was   established   in   the   department   in
anticipation of the enactment of disaster management legislation.

The centre specialises in all matters related  to  disaster,  with  specific
emphasis on the principles and on  the  prevention  and  mitigating  of  the
consequences of disasters. The centre has played a vital  role  in  bringing
relief to people who suffered as a result of the floods on  the  Cape  Flats
in 2001.

We would like to express our thanks  to  Denel,  who  donated  R100  000  as
relief for  the  people  affected.  Other  examples  include  the  effective
intervention during the runaway fires  in  the  Kruger  National  Park  last
year. A month ago the centre played a vital role in bringing relief of  more
than R1,2 million to  victims  of  the  train  tragedy  in  Mozambique.  Hon
members probably also heard about this in the media.

Currently, the centre is playing a pivotal role in the co-ordination of  the
logistical aspects of bringing food relief to a number of SADC  states.  The
World Food Programme approached the centre to make its facilities  available
in order to co-ordinate the logistics  of  distributing  maize  through  the
various identified corridors, Durban being the main corridor.
In order to achieve the aims of integrated  governance  and  provincial  and
local government support, the department is currently  putting  in  place  a
programme to strengthen its own capacity. This  includes  developing  skills
and competencies of staff and  changing  its  organisational  culture.  This
branch, called Support Services, is working specifically on realising  these
objectives of this key focus area.

In each of these focus  areas  our  programmes  require  integration  across
Government.  This  is  a  challenging  task.  We  have  been  working   with
provinces, local government and national departments to bring about what  we
truly regard as integrated service delivery.

A key pillar of accelerating service delivery is the ward committee  system.
Through ward committees, the country is witnessing  participatory  democracy
in practice. And by supporting ward committees,  we  are  ensuring  that  we
bring governance and service delivery closer to our people.

We invite all our people to  support  ward  committees  and  to  participate
actively in the  development  programmes  initiated  by  municipalities.  In
particular, we invite members of Parliament to engage with  ward  committees
and members of ward committees in their own constituencies.

In conclusion, I wish to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  Portfolio
Committee on Provincial and  Local  Government  -  as  well  as  the  select
committee in the NCOP - for the detailed and extensive report the  portfolio
committee tabled before this House on 10 June. I can  assure  the  committee
that the Ministry and the department will meet soon to consider the  report,
and we will ensure that appropriate action is  taken.  The  report  outlined
some of the key challenges  faced  by  our  country  generally  and  by  our
Ministry and department in particular.

Local government transformation remains the key and  primary  challenge.  As
we do planning and prioritisation for  the  year  2002-03  and  beyond,  the
support of the committee, which is available to all members, will be one  of
the key instruments we will have recourse to.

We have been without a director-general for about five  and  a  half  months
now. Accordingly, we have shortlisted candidates for the post  and  we  will
be conducting interviews soon. We would like to thank the  outgoing  DG,  Mr
Zamindlela Titus,  affectionately  known  as  ``Zam,''  for  his  invaluable
contribution. He has served the department as  the  DG  for  the  past  five
years and has now been redeployed to serve  as  a  special  adviser  to  the
Ministry.

This  redeployment  has  improved  the  quality  of  interface  between  the
Ministry and the department. Under the leadership  of  Zam,  the  department
has been awarded several awards. These include winning three  categories  of
the Southern African Institute of Government Auditors' annual public  sector
reporting awards for best reporting practices,  for  examples  of  excellent
financial communications, and for adherence to accounting  standards.  I  am
wondering why hon members are not applauding. [Applause.]

An HON MEMBER: We are getting tired.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: I can see that. Saiga gold  and  platinum  awards  were
also given. Another  award  given  was  the  Impumelelo  Award  for  service
delivery based on the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure  Programme.  The
department  received  this  award  for  the  second  year   in   succession.
[Applause.] Equally, I would like  to  thank  the  entire  staff  for  their
dedication and  for  working  tirelessly  to  carry  out  the  developmental
mandate of the Ministry and the department.

We would also like to thank members of Parliament who have been  interacting
with the department and the Ministry, the  parliamentary  committees,  other
departments, the President, the Deputy President,  and  our  colleagues  the
Ministers, Deputy Ministers and the MECs  for  local  government  for  their
continued support and guidance. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I trust that the hon  Bloem  is
using his considerable energy to help the Chair preserve good order  in  the
House. [Laughter.]

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, I want to thank the hon the Deputy  Minister
for waking up hon members for my speech.

The hon the Minister referred to the issue of  municipal  debt.  I  listened
very carefully to what he said. I want to start by saying that  there  is  a
tendency amongst the ANC Government and hon Ministers, the  moment  they  do
not know how to solve a problem and do not have a solution to  the  problem,
to  blame  it  on  apartheid.  It  is  always   apartheid,   apartheid   ...
[Interjections] ... but, I want to say to the hon the Minister, the ANC  has
already been in Government for eight years. [Interjections.] Let me put  the
record straight. As far as municipal debt is  concerned,  in  1993-94  there
was an agreement between the then President, Mr F W de Klerk, and  President
Nelson  Mandela  that  municipal  debt  would  be  written  off,  as  indeed
happened. The debt was written off.

Therefore I want to know from the hon the Minister what steps exactly he  is
going to take  to  ensure  that  he  curbs  the  aspect  of  nonpayment  for
services. [Interjections.]

Ek het verlede maand vir die agb Minister gevra wat  die  onderskeie  bedrae
vir die provinsies is rakende uitstaande skuld. Die totale  bedrag  wat  die
agb Minister genoem het was R22 miljard. In die geval van Noord-Wes het  die
agb Minister in sy antwoord gesê dat die uitstaande skuld aan die einde  van
2000 R517,5 miljoen was. Maar  hy  het  gesê  dat  dit  aan  die  einde  van
Desember 2001, in die geval van Noord-Wes, afgeneem het na R265 miljoen.

Verlede week is die begrotingspos van die LUR, Mnr Darkie Africa, in  Noord-
Wes gevoer. Mnr Darkie Africa het ander syfers genoem. Volgens sy  toespraak
was die uitstaande skulde R833 miljoen aan die einde van Desember  2000,  en
teen die einde van Desember 2001, was dit R1,06  miljard,  dit  net  in  die
geval van Noord-Wes.

Hoe is dit moontlik dat die Minister kan sê die  uitstaande  skuld  is  R265
miljoen,  terwyl  die  agb  LUR  in  Noord-Wes  sê  dit  is  R1060  miljoen?
[Tussenwerpsels.] Die agb lid sê hy het nie mooi geluister nie. Hier  is  'n
afskrif van die agb lid se toespraak, en hier is  'n  afskrif  van  die  agb
Minister se antwoord. Die agb lid kan dit gaan lees.

Die feit dat die agb Adjunkminister nie eers weet  van  hierdie  syfers  nie
verklaar  die   chaos   in   die   Departement   van   Plaaslike   Regering.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ek eis, namens die VF, dat òf die Minister,  òf  die  LUR,
Mnr Darkie Africa, bedank, want hy is besig om die  publiek  daar  buite  te
mislei. Hy gee nie korrekte feite oor aspekte wat  van  uiterste  belang  is
vir plaaslike regering nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die probleem van die nie-betaling van skulde kom al 'n  lang  pad  saam  met
die ANC. Die ANC het die kultuur van nie-betaling  geskep  deur  middel  van
hulle burgerlike verenigings. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is die Minister se  plig
en verantwoordelikheid om  weer  'n  kultuur  van  betaling  te  skep.  [Tyd
verstreke.]   [Tussenwerpsels.]   (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Last month I asked the hon the Minister what  the  respective  amounts  for
the provinces are concerning debt. The total amount  mentioned  by  the  hon
the Minister was R22 billion. In the case of the  North  West  the  hon  the
Minister stated in his answer that the outstanding debt was  R517,5  million
at the end of 2000. But he said that at the end of  December  2001,  in  the
case of the North West, it had decreased to R265 million.

Last week the Budget Vote of the MEC, Mr Darkie Africa, was  dealt  with  in
the North West. Mr Darkie Africa mentioned other figures. According  to  his
speech the outstanding debts were R833 million at the end of December  2000,
and at the end of December 2001 they were R1,06 billion, and  that  only  in
the case of the North West.
How is it possible that the Minister can say that the  outstanding  debt  is
R265 million, while the hon MEC in the North West says it is R1060  million?
[Interjections.] The hon member says he did not listen properly. Here  is  a
copy of the hon member's  speech,  and  here  is  a  copy  of  the  hon  the
Minister's answer. The hon member may read them.

The fact that the hon the  Deputy  Minister  is  not  even  aware  of  these
figures  explains  the  chaos  in  the  Department  of   Local   Government.
[Interjections.] I demand, on behalf of the FF, that either the Minister  or
the MEC, Mr Darkie Africa, resign, because  he  is  misleading  the  general
public. He is not

supplying  the  correct  facts  regarding  aspects  which  are  of  cardinal
importance for local government. [Interjections.]

The problem of not paying debts has come a long way with the  ANC.  The  ANC
created this culture of not paying by means  of  their  civic  associations.
[Interjections.] It is the duty and the responsibility of  the  Minister  to
once again create a culture of paying. [Time expired.] [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr B M KOMPHELA: Mhlali-ngaphambili, ndize kumxelela; ndize kumncokolela  lo
mLungu namhlanje. [Chairperson, I have come to him; I have come  to  have  a
conversation with this white man today.]

Mr Chairperson, it is a pleasure for  me  again  to  share  in  this  budget
debate. But I think I am going to indulge in ...

... wat die agb lid Pieter  gesê  het  as  ek  klaar  hieroor  gepraat  het.
Miskien is sy feite heeltemal verkeerd. Hy moet  die  regte  feite  oor  die
onderhandelinge  tussen  oud-Presidente  Mandela  en  De   Klerk   oor   die
afskrywing van die skuld gee. Hy moet vir die publiek sê watter  tipe  skuld
afgeskryf is. Dit is nie net nie-blankes se  skuld  wat  afgeskryf  is  nie!
[Applous.] [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[... the remarks by the hon member Pieter  once  I  have  dealt  with  this.
Maybe his facts are altogether incorrect. He should convey  the  real  facts
about the negotiations  between  former  Presidents  Mandela  and  De  Klerk
regarding the writing off of the debt. He should tell the public  what  type
of debt was written off. It was not only the  debt  of  nonwhites  that  was
written off! [Applause.] [Interjections.]]

If I am hungry I am not going to care about a bird  that  is  endangered.  I
will eat it if I can. Nor will I worry about whether or not to chop  down  a
tree to keep me warm if I am getting cold. Poverty  is  the  single  biggest
challenge to  sustainable  development.  If  we  fail  to  address  poverty,
sustainable development becomes just another word. [Interjections.]

In the period  2001  to  2002  and  in  this  financial  year  the  national
Government  prioritised  the  funding  of  infrastructure  development,   in
particular  the  integrated  development  programme.   The   Urban   Renewal
Programme and the Integrated Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme  are
the key things that Government has placed priority on. The local  government
equitable share has been increased to allow for prioritisation of the  areas
identified as nodal points for local government economic growth.

The Department of Provincial and Local Government has the  most  challenging
task of co-ordinating the implementation of the Urban Renewal Programme  and
the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme. A clear mandate  was
given to the ANC to tackle the legacy  of  apartheid.  We  must  talk  about
apartheid. We must not be shy about  apartheid.  Apartheid  was  there  from
1948 up until 1994, a lifetime of 50. Yet the expectation is  that  the  ANC
must eradicate  that  in  eight  years'  time.  That  would  be  a  miracle.
[Applause.]

The  apartheid  government  did  not  empower  our  people  to   embark   on
development initiatives to realise their creative potential.  Today  we  are
sitting  with  weak  municipalities  which  remain  a  major  constraint  to
sustainable development as a result of policies  which  the  hon  Groenewald
was part of during that period. [Interjections.]

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Even the Transkei.

Mr B M KOMPHELA: The hon McIntosh is right, because  even  in  the  case  of
Transkei the hon members were part of perpetuating poverty there.

Indeed, one of South Africa's major challenges is to strengthen capacity  to
govern and to develop municipalities.  There  is  also  an  urgent  need  to
implement far-reaching reforms and programmes in many  municipalities.  That
we acknowledge. That is the task which is facing us.

Mr Chairperson, I want the hon Groenewald and  hon  Mulder  to  listen.  The
period between 1948  and  1994  will  go  down  in  history  as  decades  of
unevenness and underdevelopment of our people. Today the hon member  expects
us to be shy and not say that we are tackling this deliberately in order  to
bring about a balance between the haves and the have nots. We must do  that.
[Interjections.]
As public representatives what do we do to lift the  masses  of  our  people
from poverty? I think that is a question we all, including the  hon  member,
must ask ourselves. What do we do to assist in  tackling  the  poverty  that
one sees every day? [Interjections.] That is the question that we  have.  We
must tell each other the truth. [Interjections.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  op  'n  punt  van  orde:  is  dit
aanvaarbaar en parlementêr dat 'n agb lid na my verwys asof ek deel was  van
die  vorige  regering,  hoewel  ek  nooit  vir  die  NP  gestem   het   nie?
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order:  Is  it  acceptable
and parliamentary for an hon member to refer to me as if I had been part  of
the  previous   government,   although   I   never   voted   for   the   NP?
[Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! It is not  a  point  of  order.
Hon member, you may proceed.

Mr  B  M  KOMPHELA:  The  architects  of  those  disparities  also  have   a
responsibility to assist  in  constructing  what  they  destroyed  over  the
years. They have a responsibility.

It is true that the urban areas are vanguards  of  the  centres  of  economy
while the rural areas constitute the rear vanguard. But the  ANC  Government
is making significant strides to bridge the gap by  creating  a  sustainable
livelihood in the rural areas. This year's allocation increased by  65%  and
that to the urban nodes by  35%,  and  this  shows  a  deliberate  shift  to
developing the rural areas. Sixty-five  percent  is  a  deliberate  move  to
improve the lives of those people who were  placed  in  the  homelands.  The
department also has a responsibility to make sure that  the  local  economic
development becomes  something  which  our  are  people  able  to  live  on.
Therefore we need to encourage people in this regard.

I think I must respond to some of the things which I do not  think  the  hon
the Minister, Sydney Mufamadi, will  himself  bother  to  talk  about.  With
regard to De  Klerk  and  former  President  Mandela's  World  Trade  Centre
agreement, some hon members were not there, but we  were  there  because  we
were interested as we were the people who were impoverished  at  that  time.
That agreement was about the writing off of debts in the  Rand.  There  were
huge debts for electricity and other things that we could  not  accommodate,
and they were not part of the statute to be written  off.  I  want  them  to
tell the people that it is not just a blanket writing  off  of  debts  which
the hon member  is  singing  about  today.  It  was  a  very  strategic  and
systematic approach. We  were  among  the  signatories  to  that  agreement.
[Interjections.]

With regard to the other hon members, I think I have a lot  of  respect  for
the hon Borman. I have a lot of respect for her, but if one  day  she  wakes
up and says ``I want to go  and  live  in  a  squatter  camp  which  has  no
resource whatsoever,'' she will regret that day and  will  not  ask,  ``When
are our people getting water? When will our  people  get  electricity?  When
are our people getting clinics and roads?'' and say ``The  local  government
is in a state of anarchy''. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI:  Mr  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  the  department  has,
amongst  its  functions,  the  awesome   responsibility   of   strengthening
institutions of provincial and local  government  and  traditional  leaders.
The allocation to Programme 3 - Institutional Reform and  Support  has  been
increased by 25,8% in the current financial year and accounts for  68,6%  of
the total expenditure estimate of the year under review.

The inability to resolve the  question  of  traditional  leaders  will  hang
around this department like an albatross. Thus far traditional leaders  have
yet to find joy in the way the department handles their affairs. On the  one
hand it has not been possible for Government to spell out clearly what  role
traditional leaders should play in the municipal councils and government  in
general, while on the  other  hand  the  department  failed  to  spend  R1,2
million on the implementation of the  White  Paper  on  traditional  leaders
last year. We have, however, taken note of what the hon  the  Minister  said
this afternoon on this matter and will  watch  the  developments  around  it
with great interest.

The department has since been incapable of performing as in total  some  R26
million was not spent under the Institutional Reform and Support  programme.
People roam the streets without employment while R4 million  was  not  spent
because posts are  vacant.  This  is  no  surprise  as  the  report  of  the
President's Co-ordinating Council  indicates  that  some  municipalities  in
seven  of  the  nine  provinces  indicate  that  they  have  problems   with
institutional establishments. We hope  that  transformation  in  this  field
will be accelerated so that the department can catch  up  on  this.  All  in
all, R76 million remained unspent in the last financial year from  all  four
programmes of the department.

It has also been very interesting to listen to the Minister saying how  much
the department has progressed and continues to in the IDPs. Evidence at  our
disposal proves the contrary. Whilst some municipalities are yet to  appoint
town managers, it is unfortunate that those that have  pay  these  officials
astronomical salaries which impact negatively on the average residents.

Disparities persist  amongst  municipalities.  On  paper,  local  government
covers the country from wall to wall, but in effect in some places there  is
no whiff of any municipal powers and functions. Municipalities  continue  to
perform badly and  totter  on  the  brink  of  collapsing,  while  dishonest
councillors and officials enrich themselves, as  is  the  case  in  Vryburg,
where low-cost houses are used as spaza shops  by  some  councillors.  [Time
expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members,  it  was  good  to
see the hon Komphela and the hon Groenewald  shaking  hands  and  preserving
good relationships. [Applause.][Laughter.] It shows  that  hon  members  can
engage  in  the  cut  and  thrust  of  politics  and   yet   maintain   good
relationships.

Mr A G LYLE: Chairperson, good governance, delivery  of  services  and  work
ethic are inextricably linked  to  the  degree  or  level  of  capacity.  We
therefore work from the  premise  that  capacity-building  must  be  a  core
component of most of our programmes as we govern our  country.  May  I  take
this opportunity to dedicate my speech to  those  women  and  men  who  have
volunteered to capacitate their fellow South Africans, in  particular  those
comrades who were on Robben Island and in  other  prisons  throughout  South
Africa. Some of the comrades who benefited from this selfless act under  the
most trying conditions are here with us today. My hon  comrade,  friend  and
father, Mr Diale, is a shining example. [Applause.] I want Comrade Diale  to
know that I treasure every minute I spent with him,  telling  me  about  his
experiences on Robben  Island.  I  will  certainly  pass  this  down  to  my
children.

The Department of Provincial and Local Government is currently undergoing  a
process  of  restructuring.  We  are  most  delighted  and  we  welcome  the
department's commitment to strengthening  its  capacity-building  programme.
An internal skills audit has  been  finalised  and  the  department  is  now
developing an internal capacity-building programme. We wish  the  department
success to this end.

The capacity of the department is  integrally  linked  to  the  capacity  of
local  government  and  the  statutory  bodies  that  are   accountable   to
Government through the department. Any failure of the department's capacity-
building programmes will have a serious knock-on effect on the  capacity  of
municipalities and, to an extent, of  the  provinces  as  well.  It  is  the
Department of Provincial  and  Local  Government  that  is  responsible  for
facilitating  capacity-building  and  monitoring  of  provincial  and  local
government. A nonchalant approach to capacity-building  will  surely  impede
the transformation of local government. This sphere of government is at  the
heart of transformation. We are making a radical move from the old order  to
the new  -  new  in  the  sense  that  at  the  centre  of  our  concept  of
developmental local government is the notion of a better life for all.

The local government legislative framework is  extremely  demanding  on  our
new  municipalities.  Its  interpretation  and  implementation  require  the
necessary expertise. For instance, the  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill
will bear heavily on municipalities once it is  put  in  practice.  In  this
regard we expect this piece of legislation to make provisions not  only  for
efficient  financial  management,  but  also   for   capacity-building   for
municipalities, especially around financial aspects. The  success  of  local
government rests squarely on the extent to which this sphere is imbued  with
the necessary skills.

To this end, we expect the SA Local Government  Association  and  the  Local
Government, Water and  Related  Services  Sectoral  Education  and  Training
Authority to be at the forefront of this project,  building  capacity  at  a
local government level. In our report to  Parliament,  as  a  committee,  we
note that the area of capacity-building  at  local  government  level  still
remains a serious  cause  for  concern.  We  are  acutely  aware  that  many
municipalities have had to restructure because  of  amalgamation,  and  have
had to respond to the demands of the  new  local  government  system.  As  a
committee we are convinced that another  contributing  factor  to  the  slow
progress with capacity-building is the lack of co-ordination.

In our report we therefore recommend that the department should  co-ordinate
all stakeholders who provide capacity-building to local government  and  its
structures. Salga should take the responsibility to build  the  capacity  of
councillors,  while  the  local  government  Seta  should  offer   technical
training to personnel. We are of the view that,  over  and  above  technical
capacity, both personnel and councillors need to  be  trained  on  political
values of local  government  and  of  government  in  general.  It  is  also
important that training programmes include a  component  that  encourages  a
particular work orientation in human resource training.

The  central  element  in  effective  service  delivery  is  about  building
capacity and  utilising  the  available  resources  maximally.  We  need  an
approach to capacity-building that is outcome-based and  that  is  aimed  at
producing visible results on the ground.  Salga  and  the  local  government
Seta have not lived up to our expectations in this regard. We  believe  that
more could have been achieved. However, we take note  of  the  restructuring
that has been taking place in the Seta and that this may  have  slowed  down
progress.

We wish Salga and the Seta well in their endeavours. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, Minister and Deputy Minister, I  want  to  say
that local government is a sphere of government  which  is  very  important.
They are closer to the grassroots level and to  the  hearts  of  people,  so
they need our fullest support. [Applause.] The MF would like  to  take  this
opportunity to compliment provincial and local government on the  hard  work
and dedication of the past years. The MF would also like to  voice  that  it
is aware ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Is hon member Smith  rising  on
a point of order?

Mr P F SMITH: I am,  Chair.  Chairperson,  is  it  in  order  for  a  member
allocated barely three minutes to spend two thirds of her time informing  us
of the name of her party which we are all aware of? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  member,  that  is  not  a
point of order. Continue, hon member.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, that is my prerogative. If the hon member  was
going to speak after me I would have taken a few minutes from  him.  The  MF
would like to voice that it is aware that provincial and local  governments'
ability to  deliver  is  notably  shortened  by  the  minimal  funding  made
available. For instance, within the Kwazulu-Natal province the Aids  problem
is horrific, as has been noted by  media  lately.  Further,  sanitation  and
housing  are  detrimental  to  people  within  the   province.   Needs   are
innumerable and the ability to deliver is there, but funding is a problem.

It has to be firmly taken into consideration that  although  mechanisms  and
good working relations exist between the  differing  organs  and  levels  of
government, the ability to fulfil  tasks  is  hindered  by  proper  funding.
Noting that the Constitution is supreme and the provisions  made  within  it
for concurrent national and provincial authority, provincial  authority  and
then local government by-laws, it would be silly  not  to  expect  conflict.
However, when it comes to the common  aim  to  provide  betterment  for  all
South Africans and South Africa, it builds confidence to ensure delivery  at
the end of the day.

The MF supports the meeting of minds at all levels of government  and  seeks
that provisions be made to service  funding  adequately  at  provincial  and
local  levels  so  that  delivery  can  be  made  possible.  It   is   often
misconstrued that provincial and local government fail at  performing  their
duties due to retarded membership  and  their  dedication  to  deliver  but,
unfortunately,  it  is  not  noted  that  funding  is  a  major   cause   of
nondelivery.

In view of the budget for provincial and local government the MF hopes  that
funding will  be  able  to  subsidise  projects  and  programmes  to  fulfil
communities' needs more adequately.

The MF supports Budget Vote 5. [Applause.]

Mr J M NGUBENI: Chairperson, Minister, Deputy Minister and hon members,  the
new system of developmental local government, responsive  to  the  needs  of
our people and encompassing the process of participatory  democracy,  slowly
addresses the demands of the people as enshrined in the Freedom Charter.  Of
course, yes, people are governing. According to the Municipal  Systems  Act,
community participation is no longer an option but it  is  mandatory  and  a
law. Men and women  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas  enjoy  participatory
democracy through ward committees and other structures in government.

This bears  testimony  to  the  most  important  principle  in  the  Freedom
Charter, that people are entitled to take part in the administration of  the
country and of councils that have been  replaced  by  democratic  organs  of
self-government. The President, during the  state-of-the-nation  address  in
February this year, emphasised the need to lift from the shoulders of  South
Africans the intolerable burden of poverty and  underdevelopment.  In  fact,
this budget of the department demonstrates the bold move towards  a  society
free of poverty and underdevelopment.

Local government's  allocation  of  national  resources  increases  by  R1,6
billion for the year 2000-03, and by R2,6 billion for  the  following  year,
in real terms. These increases  are  large  and  significant  in  the  fight
against poverty. However, the scourge of  poverty  and  underdevelopment  is
still with us. It is more prevalent and evident in  African  communities  in
particular. This is because of the legacy of the past.  But,  despite  these
problems, we are fortunately not in a hopeless situation. The new system  of
developmental and service delivery-orientated local  government  gives  hope
and realisable objectives. It is with pride and joy that men and women,  the
elderly and children  are  beneficiaries  of  the  free  basic  services  of
electricity and water.

Municipalities have responded to this challenge of making a better life  for
all, for the poor and the marginalised millions of our people.  The  demands
contained in the Freedom Charter are brought home, closer to the  people.  A
clear indication of the  department's  intervention  in  the  fight  against
poverty and underdevelopment is demonstrated by the  SIME  projects  of  the
financial year 2001-02. As a result of  the  2  500  projects  approved,  13
million men and women in both rural and urban areas benefited. More  than  1
000 SMMEs were used.

Notwithstanding  the  difficulties  in  ensuring  the  speedy  delivery   of
services, municipalities are contending with  the  imbalances  within  their
councils and the infrastructure backlog that is predominant in black  areas.
However, what are encouraging  are  the  budgets  passed  by  municipalities
across the country.

These budgets demonstrate  that  the  ANC-led  councils  are  systematically
addressing the historical backlogs and service delivery. The  budget  passed
by the Johannesburg Metro clearly demonstrates that it is transformative  in
nature and, for the first time, thousands of the residents  of  Johannesburg
will be receiving new services.

It is also striking that the hon Gloria Borman came here, in  front  of  us,
and did not tell  us  that,  during  the  apartheid  days,  her  party  once
governed Johannesburg. [Interjections.] What we want to know  is:  What  did
they do about Alexandra? What did they do about Soweto? [Interjections.]  In
fact, she shouts like  an  actress  here  and  forgets  that  today  we  are
cleaning up their mess. They should be thankful to the ANC. [Applause.]

For instance, in the Free State, in other  parts  of  the  Mangaung  council
area, free basic services are provided. What is striking  with  that  budget
is  that  the  historical  backlogs  in  Botshabelo   and   Thaba-Nchu   are
simultaneously addressed  with  the  provision  of  basic  services.  It  is
unquestionable that the ANC leads and governs with a vision  and  commitment
towards a society free of poverty and underdevelopment. [Applause.]

Our system of  local  government  is  unique,  responsive  and  anchored  to
strategic approaches that guarantee the future of  a  better  life  for  all
South  Africans,  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  Apart  from   service
provision,  South  Africa's  fledgling  democracy  is  facing  a  number  of
challenges such as striking the correct balance between  human  rights  and,
on the other hand, recognising the traditions and  customs  of  the  African
people within a free democratic system of government.

These  challenges  are  not  solely  for  Government  to  resolve,  but  are
challenges that beg wise men  and  women  from  all  strata  of  society  to
genuinely engage in  promoting  and  deepening  democracy  in  our  country.
Traditional  leaders  today,  through  the  Local   Development:   Municipal
Structures  Act,  do  participate  in  local  municipalities.  One  of   the
department's mandates is to develop a policy framework that will  assist  in
the management of the affairs of traditional  leaders.  The  department  has
managed to establish the National House of  Traditional  Leaders,  which  is
functioning and has a full-time chairperson and a full staff complement.

It  is  also  commendable  that  the  National  Khoisan  Council  has   been
established. It is true that there are areas of concern that were raised  by
traditional leaders, but it is not true that  Government  is  not  seriously
attending to those issues. Maybe it is important for me to demonstrate  that
in all spheres of government there  is  a  programme  focused  on  resolving
these areas of contradictions.

The concern that is centred around the administration of  communal  land  is
being given priority attention by the Departments of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs. Regarding  the  recognition  of  traditional  courts,  the  SA  Law
Commission has already published a discussion paper on  judicial  powers  of
traditional leaders. The most contentious issue, with regard to  powers  and
functions, is contained in the White Paper that the department is  about  to
introduce to Parliament. It is therefore grossly irresponsible and  careless
to suggest that the ANC is insensitive to these matters.

Our struggle is underpinned by  the  selfless  contribution  of  traditional
leaders both in the ANC and the IFP. Though these issues are not  yet  fully
resolved, the Department of Public Works has  embarked  on  a  programme  of
building chambers, which also include halls for kings, around  the  country.
These chambers  cost  about  R5  million  each.  Three  projects  have  been
completed in the Eastern Cape and two are at  an  advanced  stage.  Two  are
planned for Mpumalanga and Limpopo, respectively. This further  demonstrates
that the ANC is attending to the concern of  traditional  leaders  with  the
sensitivity and seriousness that it deserves.

In conclusion, transformation has to result in an improvement of  conditions
for all South Africans,  both  poor  and  rich.  But  the  system  of  local
government that we currently have will be able to  meet  the  challenges  of
the 21st century and bridge the diverse needs of  the  masses  and,  on  the
other hand, the middle and business classes. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP:  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  die  Departement  van  Provinsiale  en
Plaaslike Bestuur is opgesaal met 'n enorme taak. Die hele kwessie  van  die
verskillende vlakke van regerings, provinsiaal en  veral  plaaslik,  is  die
verantwoordelikheid van  die  Minister.  Gegewe  die  onlangse  grootskaalse
oorskakeling na die nuwe stelsel van plaaslike bestuur en al  die  groeipyne
wat daarmee gepaard gaan, het die Minister meer as genoeg om hom  mee  besig
te  hou.  Ons  gaan  netnou  na  hierdie  punt  terugkeer.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr  C  AUCAMP:  Mr  Chairman,  the  Department  of  Provincial  and   Local
Government has been saddled with an enormous task. The whole  issue  of  the
various levels of  government,  provincial  and  especially  local,  is  the
responsibility  of  the  Minister.  In  view  of  the   recent   large-scale
changeover to the new system of local government  and  all  the  concomitant
teething problems, the Minister has more than enough to keep  him  busy.  We
shall return to this point at a later stage.]

But let us state  first  what  we  think,  especially  about  the  issue  of
nondelivery and nonpayment at local level. Every  year,  the  share  of  the
national budget that is allocated to local  government  increases,  and  the
AEB wants to support  that.  But  the  question  arises:  Are  we  not  busy
throwing money into a bottomless pit? Mismanagement at  a  local  level  has
turned many local authorities into a state of de facto insolvency, with  the
issue of nonpayment being the prime reason.

No one can actually give the figure of outstanding municipal  debt  owed  by
consumers, but  the  figure  has  reportedly  increased  to  more  than  R22
billion. A lifestyle of ``use now pay never'' has crept in. Due  to  a  lack
of professional credit management, more money is going  to  be  written  off
every year and the consequent deterioration of the quality  of  services  is
unavoidable.

I would like to say to the  hon  the  Minister  that  if  local  authorities
cannot apply self-discipline with regard to their expenses, they  should  be
disciplined by way  of  retention  of  national  funds  allocated  to  them.
Further, the whole issue of the loss of experience at management  level  due
to irresponsible and  shortsighted  policies  of  affirmative  action  is  a
matter of serious concern. If this issue is not seriously  addressed,  local
government is going to become the disastrous Achilles heel of South  African
society.

My second point is that up to now, this department has  been  bestowed  with
the responsibility  not  only  of  local  and  provincial  government,  with
enormous  challenges  and  tasks,  but  of  virtually  every  other   matter
concerning the complex issue of catering for the pluralistic nature  of  our
society.

Hier  dink  ons  aan  die  hele  netelige  kwessie  van  die  funksies   van
tradisionele leiers, wat steeds onaangespreek bly. [Here we are thinking  of
the whole contentious issue of the functions of traditional  leaders,  which
still remains unresolved.]

I want to tell the member  who  spoke  before  me  that  they  do  not  want
chambers, but they want powers.

Daarmee  saam  is  daar  die  saak  van  die   kulturele   diversiteit   van
gemeenskappe en die kommissie ingevolge artikel 185 van  die  Grondwet.  Die
sukses van Suid-Afrika hang in 'n groot mate af  van  die  wyse  waarop  die
verskillende kulturele gemeenskappe  effektief  geakkommodeer  kan  word  in
besluitneming in Suid-Afrika.

Die  vrees  van  die  AEB  is:  Solank  as  hierdie  verantwoordelikheid  'n
marginale aspek  van  hierdie  departement  se  werklas  bly,  gaan  dit  'n
Aspoestertjiesaak bly, wat aan die agterspeen suig en nooit  prominent  deel
van  die  nasionale  agenda  word  nie.   Hierdie   aangeleenthede   is   'n
spesialiteitsgebied op sy eie. Grondige studie oor  internasionale  neigings
en oplossings in dié verband is noodsaaklik. Deurlopende  oorlegpleging  met
verteenwoordigers van verskillende gemeenskappe is onontbeerlik. Dit is  die
standpunt van die AEB dat dit  vir  hierdie  departement  onmoontlik  is  om
sommer so terloops op 'n  drafstap,  tussen  al  die  ander  dinge,  daaraan
aandag te  gee,  en  dit  terwyl  die  oorheersende  kwessie  van  plaaslike
regering al die aandag verg.

Die AEB pleit dus vir die daarstelling van 'n afsonderlike nuwe  departement
met  'n  eie  Ministerie  met  die  opdrag  van   plurale   betrekkinge   en
gemeenskapsbelange. So 'n departement kan sig self dan volledig  ingrawe  in
dié spesialiteitsterrein van die daarstelling van  'n  sosiale  orde  waarin
gemeenskappe allernoodsaaklikerwys bemagtig  word.  Dit  klink  na  'n  duur
operasie. Die vreedsame ontwikkeling van elke gemeenskap in  Suid-Afrika  is
egter van sulke kardinale belang vir  'n  vreedsame  en  voorspoedige  Suid-
Afrika dat dit oor en oor die moeite werd sal wees om  die  diversiteit  van
ons samelewing ten volle te diskonteer.
Die AEB sal met graagte sy  volle  samewerking  gee  om  so  'n  departement
suksesvol te maak, want dit is die sleutel  tot  'n  vreedsame  Suid-Afrika.
[Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Along with  that,  there  is  the  matter  of  the  cultural  diversity  of
communities and the commission in terms of section 185 of the  Constitution.
South Africa's success depends largely on  the  manner  in  which  different
cultural communities can be accommodated effectively in  decision-making  in
South Africa.

The AEB's fear is: For as long as this  responsibility  remains  a  marginal
aspect of this department's workload, it  will  remain  a  Cinderella  issue
which takes a back seat and never becomes a prominent part of  the  national
agenda. These matters  comprise  a  specialised  field  in  its  own  right.
Thorough studies on international trends and solutions in  this  regard  are
essential. Ongoing consultation with representatives of various  communities
is imperative. The AEB is of the opinion that  it  is  impossible  for  this
department to give this matter attention in a by-the-way manner, fitting  it
in between all the other things, and that while  the  dominant  question  of
local government needs all the attention.

The AEB is therefore pleading  for  the  establishment  of  a  separate  new
department  with  its  own  Ministry  charged  with  plural  relations   and
community interests. Such a department will be  able  to  make  an  in-depth
study of this specialised field concerning the  establishment  of  a  social
order in which communities are empowered as a matter utmost necessity.  This
may sound like an expensive operation. However, the peaceful development  of
every community in South Africa is so vitally important for a  peaceful  and
prosperous South Africa that it would be  well  worth  our  while  fully  to
employ the diversity of our society.

The AEB will take pleasure in giving its full co-operation to  make  such  a
department a success, because that is the key to a  peaceful  South  Africa.
[Time expired.]]
Mr G A J GROBLER: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, one of the  key
objectives of the department is  to  enhance  financial  management  at  the
local  government  level  and  to  provide  support  to  municipalities   in
financial distress. But the department simply gives money to  municipalities
that do not exercise proper financial control. Municipal  managers  who  had
no experience in financial and municipal affairs were appointed  because  of
their ANC affiliations. [Interjections.]

Portfolio committee members are currently spending hours on  the  new  Local
Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill. I would like to ask  the  hon
the Minister this question: If municipalities cannot adhere to the  existing
Act, regarding financial control, what makes us think that a  new  Act  will
change the situation? The Local Government: Municipal Systems  Act  and  the
Local Government  Municipal  Structures  Act  made  provision  for  numerous
financial control  systems.  But  let  us  look  at  the  implementation  of
something like the audit committees. Only one municipality  in  Gauteng  has
implemented that audit committee, and that is a DA-controlled  municipality.
[Interjections.]

People from outside, who have the necessary qualifications and skills,  were
appointed to that committee. Members should ask  the  hon  Sono.  Ratepayers
can scrutinise the financial affairs of  that  municipality.  This  was  not
done because they wanted to be different but because  it  is  stipulated  in
the Act. But I think that they are different. I was surprised to learn  that
the ANC councillor on that municipality, who happens to be  the  speaker  of
the district municipality of Sedibeng, voted against that committee.  Heaven
knows why. She most probably felt ashamed of the nonperformance of  her  own
ANC-controlled district municipality, which is unable to  render  protection
and health services to the people in that area.

Members should look at page 49 of the  report  that  we  received.  The  DA-
controlled municipality had to take on an additional burden of more than  R6
million on their budget to render that service. I would  like  to  tell  the
Minister that this is but one of many examples  of  nondelivery  from  these
creations  called  district  municipalities.  Why  do   municipalities   not
exercise financial controls? Why do they not? They do not do so  because  of
the irresponsible councillors. After 18 months, it has started to show.

There are many examples  of  irresponsible  councillors,  for  instance  ANC
councillors who owe more  than  R800  000  to  Emfuleni  municipality.  They
served as ANC and New  NP  councillors  before  the  year  2000.  They  were
elected again as ANC councillors. I heard this  afternoon  that  the  amount
had even increased to over a  million  rand.  One  person  even  became  the
executive mayor. Some of those who owed the biggest  amounts  now  serve  in
the mayoral committee.

I would like to tell the Minister that it is not the system's fault.  It  is
not the system's fault but it is the fault of incompetent people within  the
system. For confirmation of more horrific stories, I urge  members  to  read
the report which they received this afternoon.
Oor die Huis van Tradisionele Leiers word die een verklaring na  die  ander,
sonder 'n einde in sig, uitgereik. Blykbaar is daar 'n witskrif op  pad.  Of
die integrasie van tradisionele leiers in plaaslike  regering  gedoen  word,
is debatteerbaar. Wat egter kommer wek,  is  die  daarstelling  van  nog  'n
kommissie om om te sien  na  die  eise  van  die  tradisionele  leiers.  Die
Minister moet eerder probeer om finaliteit te kry  oor  die  aangeleentheid.
Wat het geword van jare gelede se belofte  van  internasionale  bemiddeling?
Die President reis so baie rond. Hy kan dit  gerus  doen.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
Die DA wil net vir die Minister sê: Moet net nie die  intelligensie  en  die
geduld  van  die  Huis  van  Tradisionele  Leiers  langer   onderskat   nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Regarding the House of Traditional Leaders, one statement after another  is
issued, without any end in sight. Apparently a White Paper is  on  its  way.
It is a debatable question whether or  not  traditional  leaders  are  being
integrated into local government.  However,  the  establishment  of  another
commission to deal with the claims of the traditional  leaders  gives  cause
for concern. The Minister should rather try to reach finality regarding  the
matter. What has become of the promise of international mediation  that  was
made years ago? The President travels around  so  much.  He  may  very  well
negotiate this. [Interjections.] The DA  would  just  like  to  say  to  the
Minister: Do not underestimate the intelligence  and  the  patience  of  the
House of Traditional Leaders any longer. [Interjections.]]

In conclusion, I would like to thank the hon  the  Minister  for  the  input
that he gave us this afternoon. But we must not shy away from  the  problems
at local government level. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Mr Chairperson, when the hon Gloria  Borman  came  to  the
podium, I said to my colleague over there,  Boeboe  Van  Wyk:  Let  us  just
listen whether that lady is going to make  the  same  speech  she  has  been
making since she came to Parliament. It  was  the  same  speech.  There  was
nothing to it. It was very shallow  and  it  did  not  have  any  substance.
Gloria is becoming very boring at this point in time. [Interjections.]

Die agb Minister moenie luister na die agb Pieter  Groenewald  nie.  Hy  kom
hier en sê 'n groot klomp niks. Dit is al wat hy in elk geval  kan  sê.  Dit
is nie die moeite werd om te reageer nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The hon the Minister must not listen  to  the  hon  Pieter  Groenewald.  He
comes here and says  a  lot  of  nothing.  It  is  not  worth  replying  to.
[Interjections.]]

Provision was made for the development of local plans  for  municipal  areas
in  the  recent  spate  of  local  government  legislation  that  has   been
promulgated  by  Parliament.  The   implementation   of   the   legislation,
particularly the Local Government: Municipal Structures Act  and  the  Local
Government: Municipal Systems Act, has led to  an  unprecedented  flurry  of
activities to ensure that an integrated planning process will  lead  to  the
production of an integrated development plan and  related  economic,  social
and environmental plans.

These planning processes and resultant plans are  supposed  to  reflect  the
developmental needs and aspirations of local communities,  particularly  the
poor. It is arguably the  most  important  instrument  since  1994  for  the
realisation of  transformation,  reconstruction  and  development  of  local
areas. The question that is on everyone's lips is: ``Is it  working?''  Some
of the  observations  that  have  been  made  are  that  the  Department  of
Provincial  and  Local  Government,   provincial   counterparts   and   some
municipalities  have  made  a  serious  effort  to  make   the   legislative
provisions work, despite a number of identifiable  shortcomings.  They  have
to be commended for their effort.

Some of the problems that have been identified include,  among  others,  the
need to improve the involvement  in  local  areas  of  all  the  spheres  of
government and public entities, and community groupings, including  business
and labour. It has become evident that some of the provincial  and  national
departments have not all been involved in  the  IDP  processes,  making  the
construction  of  a  plan  and  the  co-ordinating  role  of  municipalities
extremely difficult.

Some of the departments see their involvement not as essential  but  largely
as the responsibility of the municipality. Hence a large  number  of  public
servants and public officials in the employ of public entities do  not  have
a clue, at times, what the IDP process is about, thus  making  the  delivery
of services in accordance with the IDP problematic  because  provincial  and
municipality plans and  budgets  are  not  strategically  aligned  to  local
needs.  Importantly,  national  programmes  such  as   Urban   Renewal   and
Integrated and Sustainable Rural Development do not always form an  integral
part of the IDP, for reasons that confound me. [Interjections.]

This does not augur well for  a  seamless  planning  process  essential  for
policy implementation. The different budget cycles of  the  various  spheres
of  government  have  compounded  this  problem.  I  would  like   to   urge
municipalities to address this matter seriously  and  urgently,  because  we
cannot continue with this separate development of our towns and  cities.  We
still have a situation where townships and suburbs are built  and  developed
in accordance with the old apartheid policies of separate development.

Townships, with their underdevelopment  and  inferior  development,  promote
poverty and  diseases,  while  the  suburbs  are  well  constructed,  clean,
environmentally  friendly  and  very  safe.  [Interjections.]  To  quote  an
example - the hon member better listen - Atlantis, where I come from,  is  a
so-called coloured township. Right next to it, barely two  kilometres  away,
is a shantytown called Witsand, where there are many African people living.

The Blaauwberg division of the City of Cape Town  decided  to  build  houses
there. The question is: Why did they build houses there? Why  did  they  not
build houses in Atlantis where there are thousands and  thousands  of  acres
of open land available for the construction of housing? Is it  because  they
do not want us together, they do not want us to  integrate?  The  DA  had  a
golden opportunity to  integrate  us,  as  a  community,  but  they  decided
otherwise. [Interjections.]

The  same  thing  is  happening  in  Milnerton.  The  rich  white  south  is
Milnerton. Houses for blacks are  built  in  a  corner  far  away  from  the
suburbs. One also needs to look at the way these  developments  take  place.
Atlantis is poor, black,  underdeveloped,  and  needs  much  more  attention
economically. [Interjections.] Instead of the municipality finding a way  or
creating the conditions for uplifting Atlantis economically, they  went  and
built a totally new suburb called Parklands, with a  modern  infrastructure,
next to already well-developed suburbs called Table  View  and  Blouberg  in
the rich white south.

This place is, at this point, bursting at the seams  with  development,  and
yet nothing is happening in Atlantis. So  much  for  the  DA's  development!
This  is  how  the  DA  sees  development  in  the  city   of   Cape   Town.
[Interjections.] I cannot blame them, because  they  are  so  busy  sourcing
funds from international criminals that they cannot  focus  on  development.
[Interjections.] So we cannot blame them. No wonder Gerald Morkel said  with
the formation of the DA that the ANC would never govern  the  Western  Cape,
and is also now saying that we will never govern the city.

Let me tell them: we are governing the Western Cape government, and  we  are
about to govern the new city. Maybe he does not want us here because  he  is
scared we will find some more skeletons in his cupboard. [Interjections.]  I
want those members to tell Theuns Botha  from  Langeberg  municipality  that
that municipality is  not  a  family  ``erfenis''.  Tell  him  that  please.
[Laughter.]

Finally and importantly, the involvement of  various  stakeholders  has  not
been addressed with the required urgency and importance  it  deserves.  This
is largely due to the  lack  of  understanding  of  the  importance  of  the
Integrated Development Plan process and the range of plans  that  should  be
produced, and programmes and projects linked to the efficient and  effective
delivery of services. Hearing, taking cognisance of  and  accommodating  the
voices  of  the  poor  and  other  interest  groups  are  essential  to  the
development of a process that is acceptable to everyone.

It will help to concretise the rights accorded to people as  articulated  in
the  Constitution  and  the  legislation  that  has  been   promulgated   by
Parliament since 1994. The pool of sources in  the  form  of  knowledge  and
finance can in this way be enlarged  for  the  benefit  of  everyone.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I must observe that in  spite  of  the
lateness of the hour, members are still highly energised.

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson, I  know  that
the hon members from this side have been waiting for  me.  Hon  Borman   and
his colleagues on this side of the House: I must confess that I do not  have
the ability to outshout them. I prefer it  that  way  because  it  helps  to
maintain the difference between us. [Applause.]

In my main input I related experiences about wonderful South  Africans  that
I have encountered in many of my travels. These are men and  women  who  are
always looking for ways by which they can contribute to the communal  effort
of making our country a happier place in which to live.

Indeed, after the call which was made by the  President,  asking  people  to
volunteer whatever they could in order to make our country  a  better  place
to live in, we have seen a reservoir  of  positive  concern,  people  coming
forward volunteering in all sorts of ways. Many participants in  the  debate
this afternoon echoed that positive concern, a concern which I believe  must
be harnessed for the good of our country. I therefore want to say  a  hearty
thank you to all those who participated in the debate.

Of course, it  is  not  all  hunkydory;  there  are  problems.  One  of  the
problems, which many  of  the  speakers  referred  to,  is  the  problem  of
municipal  debt.  I  remember  specifically  the  hon  Gloria  Borman,   hon
Southgate and hon Mulder talking about this problem. My concern  about  what
they have been saying is that they continue to put forward tired  arguments,
in terms of which they blame the debt on  what  they  call  the  culture  of
nonpayment. I think it is  important  to  understand  this  problem  in  its
proper perspective.

Quite clearly, there is no single generic explanation  for  the  problem.  I
indicated in the speech that we have established a working  group  which  is
going to the bottom of this problem, but perhaps I need to  share  something
with this House. I lived for the better part of my life  in  a  township  in
Soweto, called Meadowlands. That part of the  township  was  established  in
1959. The last low-cost house which was built in that  part  of  Meadowlands
was built in the late 1960s. The only time we started to see additional low-
cost houses being built was after 1994. I must also  say  that  despite  the
fact that the old houses were built in 1959, it was only in 1981 that  those
houses were electrified. [Interjections.] The houses which have  been  built
since 1994 are equipped with the necessary infrastructure for  bulk  service
delivery. What then happens is that indeed, given the problems that I  spoke
about earlier on, the problems of low  growth  in  our  economy,  there  are
many, many people who remain unemployed.

We are for the first time putting a decent roof over people's heads.  Houses
are equipped with infrastructure for service delivery, and therefore we  are
delivering services to many people, who unfortunately are not  able  to  pay
for those  services.  I  think  it  is  important  therefore  to  understand
initiatives that we are taking in their interconnectedness. We  have  spoken
about  the  urban  renewal  programme,  we  have  spoken  about  the   rural
development programme. These are  programmes  towards  which  Government  is
directing investments in order to generate income for our people,  in  order
to enable them to pay for services.

I guess it is difficult for people to understand this, especially if  people
are obsessed with defining  the  ANC  as  the  native  who  caused  all  the
problems. I think  that  is  where  the  fallacy  of  their  argument  lies.
[Interjections.]

I have listened also to other  speakers,  and  indeed  I  am  interested  in
helping to address some of the genuine concerns that some  of  the  speakers
have raised. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

The MINISTER: The hon Smith asked a number of  questions,  and  about  which
issues relating  to  the  establishment  of  new  municipalities  are  still
outstanding. He wants to know if the municipalities are financially  viable.
He does not know whether councillor training is resulting in  the  equipping
of councillors to execute their mandate. But,  of  course,  he  thinks  that
there is enough in the laws to enable us  to  direct  these  operations.  Of
course, he did say that there are what he calls sophisticated provisions  in
the Municipal Structures Act, and he doubts if I have the  ability  to  make
use of these sophisticated provisions. I do not know if  there  is  anything
that I can do about his doubts.

He, then, is worried about the  frequency  or  the  infrequency  of  reports
about progress relating to the work of establishing the new  municipalities.
The new municipalities are only 18 months old. We have occasionally, and  as
periodically as possible, reported  to  this  House  the  difficulties,  the
constraints and the opportunities that we see as  far  as  this  process  is
concerned. I am not sure that we will be able to guarantee the frequency  of
reports about the local government establishment, which is  similar  to  the
one that he is looking for, similar to the weather  reports  which  he  gets
every morning. [Laughter.]

Let me say in conclusion that I would have liked to understand exactly  what
the hon Southgate is concerned about. Of course, the smallness of her  party
did not allow her to get more than two minutes of speaking  time.  Therefore
the questions she was asking were so incomprehensible that I am not able  to
help her. Having said all  this,  I  can  see  that  hon  members  are  very
agitated, and they may join us for a drink. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 20:15.

     date with regard to Violence Against Women


     May 2002


     Introduction


     This Parliamentary Committee (hereinafter  called  the  Committee)  was
     established as an Ad Hoc Committee in 1996  and  at  the  end  of  1998
     became a Standing Committee. The specific role of this committee is  to
     monitor and oversee Government's implementation of the  United  Nations
     Convention on the Elimination of all forms  of  Discrimination  Against
     Women  (CEDAW)  and  the  Beijing  Platform  for  Action.  One  of  the
     priorities set  by  the  committee  was  to  address  itself  to  their
     oversight function regarding the monitoring of violence against  women.
     In this regard, the Committee has undertaken several activities,  which
     are discussed below.
     Activities of the Committee


     1.     Violence Against Women Hearings during 1997 and 1999


     The Portfolio Committee on  Justice  and  the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  held
     hearings during 1997 and 1998 on Violence Against Women. A report1  was
     tabled in this regard. Part of the 1998 hearings also focused on  other
     aspects  relating  to  gender  and  justice.  These  include   Domestic
     Violence, the legal  system,  spousal  killings,  sexual  offences  and
     sexual offence pilot courts.


     At the time of these hearings, the  Committee  made  a  call  that  the
     Justice Ministry and other role-players accelerate the introduction  of
     the  proposed  legislation  on  Domestic  Violence  and   comprehensive
     legislation on sexual offences against women.  To  date,  the  Domestic
     Violence Act (Act 116 of 1998) has been enacted but the Sexual Offences
     legislation has still not come before Parliament.


     2.     Violence Against Women Hearings - November 1999


     The Committee held hearings from the 8th to the 17th of November  1999.
     Written and oral submissions were made. The objective of  the  hearings
     were to:


     * Identify what and where the blockages are which impede women who have
       been victims of  all  forms  of  violence,  from  having  access  to
       justice.
     * Determine the varied ways in which such obstacles to justice  can  be
       addressed and eliminated.


     The report emanating from the  hearings  thematically  categorises  the
     information under the following headings:


     * Criminal Justice.
     * Law enforcement.
     * Welfare services and shelter.
     * Health care.
     * Incarceration of offenders.
     * Recent research on violence against women.
     * Public awareness and education.
     * Allocation of financial resources and the Budget.
     * Inter-ministerial co-operation and co-operative governance.
     * Co-operation between Government and civil society.
     * The need for statistical databases.


     Although the hearings were held before the Domestic Violence Act 116 of
     1998 came into operation, it highlighted difficulties anticipated  with
     the implementation of the legislation. Many of these difficulties  also
     emerged  later  in  a  workshop  held  by  the  Committee   after   the
     implementation  of  the  Act.  The  Committee  furthermore  makes  very
     specific recommendations with regards to the different thematic areas.


     In addition to the detailed report on the hearings,  a  summary  report
     (July 2001) is also available.


    3.      Provincial visits


     Delegations from the  Committee  visited  Nelspruit,  Mpumalanga,  Port
     -Elizabeth and Pietersburg  from  April  to  June  2000.  They  visited
     Magistrates, the South African Police Service (SAPS) Commissioners  and
     Prosecutors.  These   meetings   formed   part   of   the   Committee's
     investigation into the difficulties experienced by these  officials  in
     the implementation on the Domestic Violence Act and Maintenance Act  99
     of 1998.


     4.     A Joint 2-day workshop between  the  Committee  and  the  Public
        Participation Unit (PPU) of Parliament, 25 - 26 July 2001.


     The Parliamentary Public Participation  Unit  PPU)  and  the  Committee
     convened a National Conference on enhancing the participation of  women
     in the law making process.
     The objectives of the conference were to:
     * Audit the experiences of civil society with respect to how women have
       experienced participation in the legislative processes.
     * Audit the obstacles which impede the participation of women.
     * Elicit information on how the participation of women can be improved.


     * Gather and collate information on problems experienced  with  respect
       to the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act.
     * Gather and collate information on problems experienced  with  respect
       to the implementation of the Maintenance Act.
     * Reflect on methodologies for making gendered impact  on  how  budgets
       are drawn up and how  public  sector  resources  are  allocated  (at
       national, provincial and local levels).
     * Gather and collate information  on  women's  legislative  needs  with
       respect to issues of inheritance and succession.
     Some of the specific problems that emerged from  the  presentations  on
     the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act included:


     * Inadequate resources being allocated to  the  implementation  of  the
       Act.
     * Sexual abuse often not seen as abuse.
     * When SAPS are called, the onus is often placed on women to  say  what
       they want SAPS to do with the perpetrator.
     * The forms are difficult to complete.


     A  detailed  report  entitled  "Strengthening  Women's  Voices   though
     Participation: Consultative Conference on engaging Women in Parliament"
     is available.


     5.     Rural workshops


     The PPU and the Committee hosted capacity building workshops for  rural
     women in four provinces during 2001.  The  provinces  were  Mpumalanga,
     North-West, Limpopo and Kwa-Zulu Natal. These workshops constituted the
     pilot Rural Women's Project.


     The objectives of the workshops were to:


     * Create an understanding amongst rural women about Parliament and  the
       law making process.
     * Create an understanding of how  to  participate  in  the  legislative
       process.
     * Obtain submissions on the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act
       and the  proposals  for  the  proposed  Inheritance  and  Succession
       legislation.


     It was evident from the workshops that  there  is  a  need  for  public
     education around the Domestic Violence  Act.  Many  of  the  women  who
     attended the workshops thought that only physical violence  constituted
     domestic violence. It was only after the Act was explained to them that
     they understood that there were different types of domestic violence.


     Whilst the workshops were a success, there were incidents which  nearly
     disrupted this process. The incidents were discussed  in  the  National
     Assembly to make sure that this type of incident does not occur  again,
     because it may hinder the performance of the public representatives  to
     cascade the important message to rural women in South Africa.


     6.     Committee report commissioned from the Center for the  Study  of
        Violence and Reconciliation (CSVR) on Budgets and Violence  Against
        Women.
     The Committee commissioned the Centre for the  Study  of  Violence  and
     Reconciliation to investigate the extent of government financial aid to
     non-profit organisations (NPOs) providing  support  services  to  women
     experiencing violence.
     The aims of the study were to:
     *  Quantify  government  departments'  financial  aid  and  support  to
       organisations providing some kind of support to girls and women aged
       fifteen years and older who have experienced gender-based violence.
     * Identify factors enhancing and/or constraining organisations' ability
       to access government funds for this work.
     * Describe the type  of  activities  for  which  organisations  receive
       government support.
     The  research  findings  will  be  used  to  assist  members   of   the
     Parliamentary Committee to undertake a range  of  activities  aimed  at
     ensuring that future budgets allocate sufficient funds to  address  the
     needs of women who are experiencing gender violence.


     Recommendations


     The Committee, in fulfilment of  its  oversight  role,  has  undertaken
     several informative initiatives in respect to violence  against  women.
     The reports resulting  from  the  various  initiatives  are  rich  with
     information and recommendations to various Government  Departments.  It
     is thus recommended that:


     * Questions emanating from the various forums be posed to the different
       departments with regard to the implementation of the Act,  resources
       available and budgetary requirements.
     * The various reports should be disseminated to the various departments
       and they should be asked to formally respond to it.
     * A huge public education initiative be undertaken by  GCIS  to  ensure
       that the Domestic Violence Act becomes  more  accessible  to  women,
       especially rural women.
     * We ensure that the criminal justice system is more gender  sensitive,
       especially in terms of sentencing, sensitivity of  court  officials,
       and women's access to justice.
     * More shelters be provided for women who experience domestic violence,
       because women often have to return home to perpetrators of violence,
       because there is not an adequate number of shelters.
     * Customary law be  revised,  because  rural  women  still  suffer  the
       effects of customary law.

     "We cannot say we are moving faster towards the attainment of  complete
     liberation from the legacy of the past unless the women of our  country
     live without fear in their houses and walk freely through  the  streets
     and villages of our land." - President Thabo Mbeki2
     * INTRODUCTION
     O The Joint Committee on the Improvement of the  Quality  of  Life  and
     Status  of  Women  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Committee)  was
     permanently established in June 1998 to monitor  and  oversee  progress
     with regard to the improvement of the quality of  life  and  status  of
     women in South Africa, with  specific  reference  to  the  government's
     commitments made at the United  National  Fourth  World  Conference  on
     Women in Beijing in 1995, and the  provisions  of  the  United  Nations
     Convention on the Elimination of all forms  of  Discrimination  Against
     Women (CEDAW).
     O The South African government's signature and  ratification  of  CEDAW
     created an obligation to introduce measures to protect the basic rights
     of women and to improve the status of women by eliminating gender-based
     discrimination.  CEDAW requires countries to report  to  the  UN  every
     four years, and South Africa's first progress report was  submitted  to
     the UN CEDAW Committee in 1997.
     O CEDAW defines violence against women  as  "any  act  of  gender-based
     violence that results in, or is likely to result in,  physical,  sexual
     or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of  such
     acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty,  whether  occurring
     in public or in private life."3  It encompasses "physical,  sexual  and
     psychological violence -
     * occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of  female
     children in the household, dowry-related violence, marital rape, female
     genital mutilation and other traditional practices  harmful  to  women,
     non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation;
     * occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse,
     sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions
     and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution;
     * perpetrated or condoned by the state, wherever it occurs."4
     O The Beijing Platform for Action (BPFA) is  a  comprehensive  plan  of
     action to enhance the social, economic  and  political  empowerment  of
     women, and is premised on  the  need  for  the  sharing  of  power  and
     responsibility in the home, workplace  and  in  wider  society.   South
     African government departments tabled their commitments to the BPFA  in
     February 1996.
     O In his opening address to Parliament on 25 June 1999, President Thabo
     Mbeki's spoke of  the  "twilight  world  of...  continuous  sexual  and
     physical abuse of women and children".  More light  has  been  shed  on
     this twilight world during the past year than ever before,  mainly  due
     to the increased vigilance of the public with  the  assistance  of  the
     media.
     O Interpol: SA has highest reported rape ratio in the  world  Insurance
     Policy.
     O The objectives of the November  1999  hearings  on  violence  against
     women were the following:-
     * to identify what and where the blockages are which impede  women  who
     have been victims of all forms  of  violence,  from  having  access  to
     justice;  and
     * to determine the varied ways in which such obstacles to  justice  can
     be addressed and eliminated.
     O The hearings were held from 8 to 17 November 1999.  A  full  list  of
     submissions (both written and oral) appears at the end of  the  report.
     Copies of all written submissions  are  available  from  the  Committee
     clerk.  Other documents referred to in this report are also  listed  at
     the end hereof.
     O This report will deal with the following aspects of violence  against
     women, with special reference to the submissions made at the hearings:
     * criminal justice;
     * law enforcement;
     * welfare services and shelters;
     * health care;
     * incarceration of offenders;
     * recent research on violence against women;
     * public awareness and education;
     * allocation of financial resources and the Budget;
     * inter-ministerial co-operation and co-operative governance;
     * co-operation between government and civil society;
     * the need for a statistical database;
     * recommendations and queries to government departments.
     * CRIMINAL JUSTICE
     New and proposed legislation and its implementation
     O CEDAW stipulates that government should "develop penal, civil, labour
     and administrative sanctions in  domestic  legislation  to  punish  and
     redress the wrongs caused to women who are subjected to violence; women
     who are subjected to violence should be provided  with  access  to  the
     mechanisms of justice and, as provided for by national legislation,  to
     just and effective remedies for  the  harm  that  they  have  suffered;
     States should also inform women of  their  rights  in  seeking  redress
     through such mechanisms."5
     O Significant progress has been  made  in  the  amendment  of  existing
     legislation  and  the  promulgation  of  new  legislation  relating  to
     violence against women and children.  The most important of these are:
     * the Domestic Violence Act (DVA)6, which comes into  operation  on  15
     December 1999 and replaces the  Prevention  of  Family  Violence  Act7.
     Difficulties  anticipated  with  the  implementation  of  the  DVA  are
     described elsewhere;
     * limiting the granting of bail for persons accused of having committed
     specified serious offences, which include rape;8
     * providing for minimum sentences for murder and rape with  aggravating
     circumstances.9 Certain difficulties in the judicial interpretation  of
     especially the minimum sentence amendment have come to light, and  will
     be detailed below.
     * The South African Law Commission (SALC) has also  produced  a  Sexual
     Offences Discussion Paper  incorporating  a  proposed  Sexual  Offences
     Bill.  The most important features of the proposed Sexual Offences Bill
     are the following:-


     * The common law definition of rape (a man having intentional  unlawful
     sexual intercourse with a woman, without  her  consent)  restricts  the
     sexual intercourse to the penetration of the vagina by the  penis,  and
     non-consensual anal or oral penetration does  not  constitute  rape  or
     indecent assault in common law.  In proposing the repeal of the  common
     law offence of rape, the Commission  has  put  forward  a  new  gender-
     neutral statutory offence, centring on  'unlawful  sexual  penetration'
     under coercive circumstances.
     This definition means that the State will  not  be  required  to  prove
     absence of consent on the part of the victim.  The  accused  can  still
     raise consent to sexual intercourse as justification for  the  unlawful
     conduct, but will in future have to carry the burden of proof  in  this
     regard. Furthermore,  penetration  would  include  penetration  to  any
     extent by a penis, object/part of the body of a person/animal into  the
     anus, ear, mouth, nose, vagina/body  orifice  of  an  animal;  or  body
     orifice of a person in a manner simulating  sexual  intercourse.   This
     means, inter alia, that both men and women  can  be  rape  victims  and
     perpetrators.
     "Under  coercive  circumstances"  include  force,  threat,   abuse   of
     authority,  impaired  mental  capacity,  unlawful  detention,  mistaken
     identity, mistaken act or if the complainant is under 12 years of age.
     The  proposed  legislation  also  provides  that  marriage   or   other
     relationships does not constitute a defence to rape, and a husband  can
     therefore be convicted of  raping  his  wife.   It  also  provides  for
     retrospective application. Furthermore, rape  in  other  laws  will  be
     replaced by the new definition.
     * Similarly, the current position defines incest as sexual  intercourse
     between  persons  within  prohibited  degrees  of  relationships.   The
     proposed definition is that sexual penetration replaces the term sexual
     intercourse.
     * In the proposed legislation, sexual molestation constitutes a  sexual
     act with a child of two years and younger.  It  includes  committing  a
     sexual act with the intention of inviting/persuading/allowing  a  child
     of two years and younger to  engage  in  a  sexual  act.   The  child's
     consent does not constitute a defence. A child is  defined  as  someone
     under the age of 16 years.
     * Persistent sexual abuse of a  child  (two  or  more  occasions  of  a
     sexual/act/penetration with a child within a period of one  year)  will
     constitute an offence in the proposed legislation.
     * In the proposed legislation child prostitution constitutes  a  sexual
     act with a child (someone under the age of 18 years) for reward, favour
     and compensation to a child or any other person. It includes  inviting,
     persuading/inducing  a  child  to  commit  a  sexual  act  for  reward,
     favour/compensation.
     *  Keeping  a  brothel  for  child  prostitution:  Keeping  a   brothel
     constitutes an offence.  A  brothel  is  defined  as  movable/immovable
     property where commercial exploitation  of  a  child  occurs.   Keeping
     includes: owning, leasing, renting, managing,  occupying  or  otherwise
     having control of a brothel.
     * Facilitating or allowing commercial sexual exploitation:  This covers
     any person who facilitates commercial sexual exploitation, including  a
     parent,  guardian   or   caregiver   who   allows   commercial   sexual
     exploitation.
     * Provisions not included in the Proposed  Bill  include  cultural  and
     religious  practices   considered   harmful   to   children10,   sexual
     harassment11, the criminalisation of harmful behaviour of  people  with
     HIV and the HIV testing of sexual offenders.
     * The proposed legislation,  and  in  particular  the  move  away  from
     without consent to include coercive circumstances is considered by many
     organisations  as  very   progressive.    Women's   organisations,   in
     particular Rape Crisis, have expressed support for the  new  definition
     of rape.12
     O The SALC is also in the process of producing a  discussion  paper  on
     the procedural aspects of the prosecution  of  sexual  offences,  which
     will also deal with the evidentiary rules, which  operate  against  the
     complainant in rape cases.  Such evidentiary rules, which are  arguably
     based on common assumptions that women's evidence in rape trials should
     be treated with caution since  women  are  thought  to  lie  in  sexual
     offence cases out of jealousy, spite and revenge, include:-


     * the cautionary rule, in terms of which certain types of evidences are
     treated with caution in a criminal trial, such as where the complainant
     is the only witness;
     * evidence of the previous sexual history of the complainant, which can
     only be admitted with the consent of the presiding officer on the basis
     of its relevance.  This rule appears to be based  thereon  that,  if  a
     woman has had sexual intercourse (whether or not such  intercourse  was
     with the accused), she is more  likely  to  have  consented  to  sexual
     intercourse;
     * the rule of  first  report  in  rape  or  sexual  offence  cases,  an
     exception to the general rule that previous consistent  statements  are
     inadmissible, in terms of which the  complainant's  evidence  that  she
     reported the rape to another person soon after the alleged  offence  is
     admissible.  The application of this rule often leads to the drawing of
     a negative credibility conclusion if the complainant did not report the
     alleged offence to another person.
     O In its June 1998 report on the Violence Against Women  Hearings,  the
     Committee described a submission  from  the  Centre  for  Violence  and
     Reconciliation detailing the phenomenon of "intimate  femicide"  -  the
     killing of women by intimate male partners.   The  submission  compared
     sentences handed out to men and women  who  killed  their  spouses  and
     found startling disparities in  what  appeared  to  be  inappropriately
     light sentences for men who murdered their partners and inappropriately
     heavy sentences for women who did the same in the context of continuous
     domestic violence.  Recommendations by the Centre included:-


     * establishing a task team to consider the question of gender  bias  in
     sentencing;
     * introducing legislation permitting the introduction of  similar  fact
     evidence or evidence of a history of domestic violence;
     *  abandoning  the  complete  defence  of   non-pathological   criminal
     incapacity;
     * early release for women serving sentences for killing their  abusers;
     and
     * training of members of the judiciary.
     o Specific impediments to the implementation of the DVA was raised in a
     written submission to the Committee by the  Gender  Advocacy  Programme
     (GAP)13:
     * Women lack  knowledge  on  their  rights  to  freedom  from  domestic
     violence, and their specific remedies in terms of the DVA.
     * The  DVA  gives  magistrates  discretion  to  determine  whether  the
     respondent is committing or has committed an act of domestic  violence,
     and whether the complainant may suffer undue hardship as  a  result  of
     the  domestic  violence.   This  opens  this  way  for  prejudices   of
     magistrates to affect the protection of women, and  to  lead  to  great
     inconsistency in the application of the DVA.
     * Allowing legal representation in court will disadvantage women who do
     not have the financial means to solicit  legal  assistance.   This  may
     also discourage women from applying for a protection  order,  and  make
     the process a lengthy and costly affair.
     * Clerks of the Court are not trained to fulfil the role of  the  point
     of entry to the justice system for complainants of domestic violence.
     * The DVA places the burden of the costs of service on the complainant;
     if she cannot pay, she has to furnish the Clerk of the Court with proof
     that she is not able to pay.  The complainant will  usually  also  lose
     time at work to apply for a protection order, resulting in  a  loss  of
     income.
     * The majority of South  African  women  reside  many  miles  from  the
     nearest police station or magistrate's court, limiting their access  to
     the remedies provided by the DVA.
     *  Support  services  such  as  shelters,  financial   support,   legal
     assistance, police protection, access to housing, education,  training,
     employment opportunities, psychological services are  all  required  to
     assist women to transcend the cycle of abuse.
     * The DVA provides the SAPS with clear roles  and  responsibilities  in
     assisting victims  of  domestic  violence.   Women  are  understandably
     critical of the services provided by the SAPS, especially  in  view  of
     past attitudes to domestic violence as a  "family  matter"  and  not  a
     serious offence.
     * The DVA makes provision for the complainant to receive  a  notice  of
     her rights in her official language and to have  the  contents  thereof
     explained to her.  Most police stations are understaffed  and  no  more
     than three official languages are spoken.  As far as GAP was aware,  no
     additional  personnel  had  been  allocated   to   stations   for   the
     implementation of the DVA, nor had strategies  to  address  this  issue
     been developed.
     O The head of the Family Court also raised the following concerns about
     the implementation of the DVA:


     * The DVA provided for 13 new forms, for  which  the  printing  by  the
     Government Printer had not yet commenced at the time of the hearings.
     * The DVA provided that an application for a protection order would  be
     heard after hours only if the complainant would suffer "undue hardship"
     if the matter was  not  heard.   Concern  was  raised  about  how  this
     hardship would be determined if the complainant was not given an  after
     hours hearing.
     O The Department of Justice made certain general  comments14  regarding
     difficulties with implementation of new legislation:
     * The consultation process with all roleplayers (some  independent)  is
     time-consuming.
     * The delay in implementing new legislation is  caused  by  a  lack  of
     policy statement and implementation strategy for such legislation:   an
     implementation strategy and the funding thereof must be discussed  from
     the outset of development of policy and drafting of new legislation.
     * New  policies,  legislation  and  the  expectations  created  thereby
     increase the existing case load and need for funding, which causes  bad
     service delivery, which means that, as before, victims do not  approach
     courts with gender and gender violence disputes.
     Functioning of existing courts and establishment of special courts
     O Women reported negative experiences of courts  in  general,  and  the
     rate  of  conviction  of  crimes  of  violence  against  women  remains
     unacceptably  low.    Submissions   complained   about   inexperienced,
     unprofessional and ill-prepared prosecutors, insensitive  treatment  of
     traumatised witnesses,  lack  of  facilities  at  courts  and  lack  of
     transport to courts, magistrates' lack of understanding  of  issues  of
     gender violence, clogged-up court rolls15 and unnecessary postponements
     of matters16, a shortage of regional  magistrates  and  more  qualified
     prosecutors, intermediaries and interpreters.17
     O The Masimanyane Women's Support Centre reported to the Committee on a
     study on domestic violence and rape using police  dockets18  and  court
     files.

     O Masimanyane reported that the police expected the social  workers  to
     inform women of their rights, while social workers expected the  police
     to do it.  One woman who went to the district surgeon was sent back  to
     the police (for which she had to find her own transport)  because  they
     said no medical examination could take  place  until  she  had  made  a
     statement (though they could have called the  police  to  come  to  the
     hospital).
     O Overall, Masimanyane described  a  lack  of  communication,  lack  of
     training and a lack of transport  to  hospitals  and  police  stations.
     They also reported a reluctance on the part  of  medical  examiners  to
     appear in court for fear of witnesses being  treated  with  disrespect.
     Victims often back out of prosecution due to lack  of  support.   There
     are reports of women waiting for their court  appearance  in  the  same
     hallway as her assailants. The victims do not know what is going on and
     they are not given any information at  all.   Examples  were  cited  of
     dockets  being  lost  and  of  victims  not  being  notified  of  their
     assailant's bail hearing nor of his release on bail.
     O UCT's Institute of Criminology's Gender, Law and Development  Project
     reported that, based on research  undertaken  in  rural  areas  in  the
     Southern Cape, women had to wait in the same area as the  accused,  did
     not have proper consultation with the prosecutor before trial,  failure
     to explain the decision whether to prosecute  or  not,  and  inadequate
     preparation for the trial.
     O The Commission on Gender Equality reported the failure of Sheriffs to
     serve interdicts in informal settlements, demanding service fees to  be
     paid prior to  service,  requiring  applicants  to  deliver  interdicts
     themselves, and even the complete absence of sheriff services in  rural
     areas. The Commission  also  complained  of  a  lack  of  follow-up  in
     domestic  violence  cases,  especially  breaches  of  existing  orders,
     decision  by  particular  court  to  issue  peace  orders  instead   of
     interdicts  to  lack  of  sheriff  services  in  rural  areas,  handing
     interdicts to applicants for service when applicants do not have enough
     money to pay sheriff's fees.
     O  The  Department  of  Justice  told  the  Committee  that  they  were
     finalising a Customer  Service  Charter  for  Court  Users,  a  Service
     Delivery Improvement Plan and Victims Rights Charter, and were  engaged
     in various information campaigns for court users, including the Sixteen
     Days of Activism against Violence Against Women.
     O In  the  Department  of  Justice's  1997  report,  it  described  the
     development of  a  monitoring  system  for  the  Guidelines  on  Sexual
     Offences developed by a national  task  team.   This  issue  was  again
     mentioned in the Department's 1998 report.  The Committee  still  needs
     to  know  from  the  Department  whether  a  method  of  enforcing  the
     Guidelines have been further investigated and implemented.19
     O In the Department's 1998 report, it reported back on a Canadian study
     tour dealing  with  violence  against  women.  Lessons  from  the  tour
     included an inter-sectoral approach, the economic empowerment of women,
     survivor counselling and offender rehabilitation, and the establishment
     of shelters and safe houses for victims.  The Department further stated
     that the Department would present a report on the  study  tour  to  the
     NCPS inter-ministerial meeting and that the  Department  envisaged  the
     appointment  of  an  inter-sectoral  task  team   to   facilitate   the
     implementation of the recommendations.20  The  Committee  requests  the
     Department of Justice to furnish it with  a  progress  report  in  this
     regard.
     O The Committee  also  intends  establishing  from  the  Department  of
     Justice whether the necessary forms prescribed by  the  DVA  have  been
     printed and distributed to magistrate's courts across the country.
     O The  Department  of  Justice  reported  to  the  Committee21  on  two
     programmes for implementation of specialised courts.
     * Specialised family courts, already operating as pilot courts  in  CT,
     PE, Durban, JHB and LebowaKgomo, handled inter alia  domestic  violence
     matters, with the Family Advocate, Department of  Welfare  and  various
     NGO's working at these centres to provide  counselling,  mediation  and
     investigation.   The  Department  of  Justice  indicated  that  it  was
     intended that new Family  Courts  would  be  established  in  Mafikeng,
     Nelspruit, Umtata, George, Bloemfontein and Kimberley,  with  satellite
     centres at Magistrate's Courts around the main centres.
     * However, the head of Family Courts reported22 to the  Committee  that
     there was little infrastructure and support services available for  the
     Family Courts, even though they had been in existence  for  six  years.
     The  courts  were  badly  underfunded  (for  example,  stationery   and
     photocopiers were not available), which causes unnecessary delays,  for
     example in the granting of interdicts.   There  were  also  no  waiting
     rooms for women.
     * A serious security problem was also experienced at the Family  Courts
     and there were instances of assault on the premises.  Often women  were
     too scared to leave the  offices  since  they  knew  that  the  alleged
     perpetrator would be waiting outside.
     * There are presently four sexual offences  courts,  which  are  better
     placed to deliver higher quality service to  the  victims  of  violence
     against women  and  children.   The  Department  of  Justice  told  the
     Committee that it planned to roll out 20 new Sexual Offences Courts  in
     the next two years.
     * The four existing Sexual Offences Courts are all  situated  in  urban
     areas, which means that complainants from rural areas  have  to  travel
     long distances to attend the trial.  Due to lack of transport,  such  a
     complainant may even find herself in the same vehicle as the accused.23
     The Department of Justice reported that 20 new Sexual  Offences  Courts
     would be established within the next two years.  The pilot project  for
     Family Courts would also be expanded to other centres.
     * The Regional Magistrate's Commission24 presented the  Committee  with
     statistics for the Sexual Offences Court in Wynberg:

     O Two of the permanent magistrates in  the  Sexual  Offences  Court  in
     Wynberg raised the following concerns25 with the Committee:
     * There is a need  to  reconsider  the  adversarial  system  in  sexual
     offence cases.  Such a system assumes that  both  parties  were  equal,
     while such equality had to be questioned  where  the  one  party  is  a
     little girl, and the other an elderly man with a senior advocate.  Much
     of the outcome  of  a  case  depended  on  the  ability,  wit,  energy,
     ruthlessness and even  permissible  rudeness,  which  a  cross-examiner
     might display. The selfish and partial manner with  which  parties  are
     allowed to present evidence results  often  in  procedural  and  formal
     truth being promoted at the expense of material truth.
     * There was also a need to re-examine  the  strict  rules  of  evidence
     applicable in sexual offence cases, and in  particular  the  cautionary
     rules of evidence.
     * There should be a general rule that children should  testify  through
     an intermediary, and only in exceptional circumstances should there  be
     deviated from this rule.  Consideration should be given to an amendment
     to Section 170A of the  Criminal  Procedure  Act  to  include  mentally
     impaired persons with a mental age of less than eighteen. It  was  also
     difficult for magistrates to determine  when  a  witness  would  suffer
     "undue mental stress" as is required by Section 170A.
     * Difficulties have arisen in the interpretation of  Section  51(3)  of
     the Criminal  Procedure  Amendment  Act26  regarding  imposing  minimum
     sentences, as well as the restrictive interpretation of Section 158  of
     the CPA, which deals with the circumstances in which a court may depart
     from the general principle that a witness should give his  or  evidence
     in the presence of the accused.
     O The Director of Public Prosecutions reported that,  from  1  December
     1999, a special High Court would  be  convened  in  Mndantsane  in  the
     Eastern Cape to hear only rape cases, which had  built  up  during  the
     last three years.
     Court clerks, interpreters and prosecutors
     O Two important functions of clerks of the court were emphasised during
     the hearings:  their role as organisers and facilitators of case  rolls
     at courts, and their role  as  primary  assistants  to  applicants  for
     protection orders in terms of the DVA.
     * The President of the Regional Court for the Western Cape27  told  the
     Committee that the organisation of court rolls was  one  of  the  major
     difficulties faced by  Magistrates.   A  system  of  "court  nags"  has
     recently been introduced, with the court  nag's  task  to  ensure  that
     cases set to run will in fact run,  mainly  by  phoning  witnesses  and
     other role players two weeks prior to the trial date to ensure that all
     will be available on that day.
     * The Tswaranang Legal Advocacy Centre to End Violence Against  Women28
     told the Committee that, since clerks were the first entry point for  a
     woman at court, they need  to  give  better  technical  assistance  and
     support.  GAP29 also emphasised the need for proper training of  clerks
     of the court, since the  treatment  women  receive  from  clerks  often
     result in women not returning with application forms for interdicts.
     O The lack of experienced prosecutors trained in dealing with crimes of
     violence against women  emerged  as  a  major  impediment  to  criminal
     justice. Often prosecutors are the survivor's only ally in the criminal
     justice  system,  and  these  prosecutors  are  not  equipped  to  deal
     sensitively30 with the traumatised complainant or to provide  an  equal
     opponent to experienced defence attorneys.
     * The Tswaranang Legal Advocacy Centre to End  Violence  Against  Women
     described prosecutors as insensitive to gender violence, and complained
     of a lack of consultation with the complainant.31
     * The Masimanyane  Women's  Support  Centre  reported  on  difficulties
     caused by the high turnover in prosecutors, with prosecutors  going  on
     leave, study leave, or transfer to other courts.32
     * In its submission to the Committee, the UWC's  Community  Law  Centre
     reported that prosecutors are ill-prepared because of  large  workloads
     and blamed a lack of resources.
     * The Director of Public Prosecutions reported to  the  Committee  that
     public prosecutors have been told that  violence  against  women  is  a
     priority  area:  the  number  of  convictions  needs  to  increase  and
     instructions  have  been  given  to  ensure  that  investigations   are
     completed quickly to so that victims do not forget  parts  of  evidence
     and defendants are  advantaged  by  the  lapsed  period  of  time.   In
     addition, prosecutions may only be withdrawn on the  authority  of  the
     Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions.
     * The Head of the Sexual Offences Unit and  Community  Affairs  in  the
     Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions told the Committee  that,
     since the bulk of sexual offenders appear before Regional  Courts,  the
     regional court prosecutors require urgent training in the  presentation
     of evidence, in  particular  scientific  evidence,  in  sexual  offence
     cases.  Two  training  courses  had  already  been  held  involving  60
     prosecutors, which courses  dealt  with  the  collection  of  evidence,
     presentation of DNA evidence, cross-examination skills and  sensitivity
     in dealing with witnesses (including  the  framing  of  age-appropriate
     questions).
     * In this regard, the Sexual Offences Unit had met the Child Protection
     Units in all provinces to get them to co-operate with prosecutors,  and
     also found that the training of prosecutors and investigators  together
     was very beneficial.  It was also proposed that a coalition  should  be
     formed  between  NGO's  and  the  police  and  prosecutors  to  provide
     counsellors and intermediaries for traumatised witnesses.
     * The Department of Justice reported to the Committee that they were in
     the process of establishing pre-trial services to alert prosecutors and
     magistrates to previous convictions and arrests of offenders.
     O The President of the Regional Court in the Western Cape also reported
     a  real  need  for  more  qualified  prosecutors,  intermediaries   and
     interpreters.
     Magistrates
     O During the course  of  the  hearings  it  became  apparent  that  the
     Regional Courts, which heard 95% of all rape  cases  as  the  court  of
     first instance, should be the focus of emergency reform.
     O The President of the Regional Court in the Western Cape reported  the
     following difficulties in her submission to the Committee:
     * There was currently a backlog of 7 000 cases in the  regional  courts
     in the Western Cape.  The present delay between complaint and trial was
     approximately 9 months.
     * There were only ten permanent seats of  the  regional  court  in  the
     Western Cape,  with  satellite  courts  in  the  rural  areas  such  as
     Malmesbury, Springbok, Calvinia, Vredenburg, Vredendal.
     * The four sexual offences courts were all  situated  in  urban  areas,
     which often means that very young  complainants  have  to  travel  long
     distances  to  give  evidence.  Due  to  lack  of  transport,  such   a
     complainant may even find herself in the same vehicle as the accused.
     * There is a severe  shortage  of  regional  magistrates,  and  it  was
     recommended that provision should be made for acting magistrates to  be
     employed. It was also mentioned that it  was  a  serious  psychological
     health hazard for prosecutors and magistrates to adjudicate  in  sexual
     offences courts for lengthy, uninterrupted periods of time.
     O The National Network on Violence Against Women complained  that  many
     judicial officials have little or no understanding of gender  violence,
     the rape trauma syndrome  or  the  battered  wife  syndrome,  which  is
     evidenced by their negative attitudes directed at  survivors  of  these
     crimes.  Various submissions, including that of  the  Tswaranang  Legal
     Advocacy Centre to end Violence Against Women and Ilitha Labantu argued
     that both magistrates and judges  require  training  on  the  non-legal
     aspects of rape.
     O The Chief Director of Justice College reported to  the  Committee  on
     the training of regional and district court  magistrates,  as  well  as
     prosecutors on sexual offences, child law, domestic violence,  violence
     against women (a pilot training project), basic human rights and social
     context training.  The Justice College receives a significant amount in
     donor funding in addition to its own budget.


     The judiciary
     O The Committee  has  on  various  occasions  expressed  concern  about
     inappropriate statements made by High Court judges and what appears  to
     be inappropriately light sentences handed down in judgements  in  cases
     of rape and other violence against women33.  To date,  the  Committee's
     efforts to engage  in  discussion  with  the  judiciary  on  issues  of
     violence  against  women   has   been   hampered   by   incorrect   and
     sensationalist media reporting.  However, the Committee remains of  the
     view that such discussion could be beneficial to both the Committee and
     the judiciary.
     O Many of the submissions expressed concern about  statements  made  in
     recent judgements of High Court judges in cases of rape, especially  in
     the context of the minimum sentence amendment to the Criminal Procedure
     Act34. Numerous calls were made for the education of judges  on  issues
     relating to discrimination and violence against  women.   For  example,
     concern was expressed about views on women taken by the judiciary which
     reveal  a  reliance  on  stereotypes  and  which  suggest  that   women
     collaborate in crimes against them.35
     O This issue came to the fore  in  the  interpretation  of  the  recent
     amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act dealing with the imposition  of
     a minimum sentence of life imprisonment where the victim is  under  the
     age of 16, is raped more than once, is raped by more  than  one  person
     where such person is acting with a common purpose, or  where  the  rape
     involves the infliction of grievous bodily harm, save where  the  court
     is satisfied that  "substantial  and  compelling  circumstances"  exist
     which would justify  a  less  severe  sentence.   It  is  the  judicial
     interpretation of this exception, which  has  come  under  scrutiny  by
     women's organisations and the media.
     O The Committee was furnished with a submission by the UWC's  Community
     Law Centre's Gender Project36  which  examines  disparities  in  recent
     cases.
     * In the case of S v Zitha37, a six-year-old girl was raped in her home
     by three men who had  entered  the  house  (armed  with  a  panga)  for
     purposes of robbery.  Despite the girl's pleas that they take  whatever
     they want but just leave her alone, the three men raped her in turn  on
     her own bed, one of them raping her twice. All three men were convicted
     of rape.
     During sentence proceedings, it was argued on  behalf  of  the  accused
     that the youth of the three men (they were 20, 19 and 18 at the time of
     the commission of the offence) constituted a substantial and compelling
     circumstance,  along  with  the  fact  that  none  had   any   previous
     convictions and all three had come from unfortunate backgrounds.   More
     astonishingly, it was advanced on behalf of the accused that the little
     girl had not suffered any serious injury apart from the rape  and  that
     the rape had not been premeditated since the  men  had  gone  into  the
     house in order to commit a robbery.
     Goldstein J held that even if the rape had not been planned in advance,
     it was no simple act - it "constituted a series of  horrific  invasions
     of the sanctity of the  complainant's  body".   He  also  rejected  the
     argument that the accused's youth and clean record could be seen  as  a
     substantial and compelling circumstance, and held that it was the  duty
     of the court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment for the  offence
     of rape.
     * In the case of S v Segole38, a  24-year-old  woman  was  abducted  at
     gunpoint by two men. She was driven to a deserted farm, robbed  of  her
     jewellery and valuables and then ordered into a the deserted ruin of  a
     house, where both men raped her. Afterwards, she was tied up  and  left
     there. She managed to escape from the  house,  and  reached  safety  by
     stumbling through mud and swamps to a factory nearby.
     It was advanced on behalf of the accused that the complainant  had  not
     suffered any serious physical injury nor  had  she  to  be  treated  in
     hospital. It was even argued that she exaggerated the severity  of  the
     injuries and that the psychological  trauma  was  not  severe.  It  was
     further argued that both accused were from a deprived background.
     Jordaan AJ quite correctly  took  the  evidence  of  the  psychological
     trauma experienced by the survivor into consideration and  stated  that
     he could not "disregard these factors". He also stated that  no  weight
     could be attached to the fact that the accused were from  disadvantaged
     backgrounds as they had not gained anything by raping the  woman.  They
     could simply have robbed her and taken her vehicle - yet they chose  to
     humiliate and degrade her.  In  conclusion  it  was  stated  that  "the
     circumstances of this  case  do  not  create  compelling  circumstances
     envisaged by Parliament."
     * In the case of S v Shongwe39, a nine-year-old girl was raped  in  her
     home by the father of her mother's boyfriend. He was  interrupted  when
     someone entered the house. The district surgeon who examined  the  girl
     stated that her injuries were slight in  that  there  were  two  slight
     vaginal tears, which appeared superficial.
     Cillie J felt that any person with  practical  experience  in  criminal
     cases and sentencing would regard a sentence of  life  imprisonment  on
     the accused in this case as "shocking".  He interpreted the section  of
     the Act to mean that wherever a judicial officer is of  the  view  that
     the sentence which would have been imposed prior to the Act and the one
     required in terms of the new Act are so different that it leads  to  an
     injustice, then a departure from the Act would be justified. The  court
     held that the non-serious nature of the offence and the  lack  of  real
     harm to the child  were  sufficient  grounds  for  departing  from  the
     mandatory sentence requirement.
     This decision needs to be compared with the decision of S v  Mofokeng40
     the court comes to exactly the opposite conclusion.  Here it  was  held
     by Stegmann J that for substantial and compelling circumstances  to  be
     present the facts of the particular case must present some circumstance
     that is so exceptional in its nature and that so obviously exposes  the
     injustice of the statutorily prescribed sentence that it can rightly be
     described as "compelling".
     The  decision  in  Shongwe  is  patently  wrong,  and  results  in   an
     emasculation of the new legislation. It in no way  takes  into  account
     the purpose of the legislation or the ordinary grammatical  meaning  of
     the words "substantial and compelling circumstances" as opposed to  the
     words "any other circumstance which in the opinion of the court  should
     be considered."
     * In S v Mahamotsa41, two women under the  age  of  16  were  raped  on
     separate occasions by a 23-year-old man. Both were raped more than once
     by the accused, who had apparently taken them to his house by means  of
     a weapon or something resembling a weapon (the sentencing  judgment  is
     not very clear in this regard). The second rape was committed after the
     accused had been arrested for the first incident and  released  in  the
     care of his guardian.
     Kotze J firstly listed a number of mitigating factors,  which  included
     the fact that the complainants did not lose their virginity as a result
     of the incidents. They had already been sexually active,  and  "one  of
     them, although only at school,  had  sexual  intercourse  with  another
     person  two  days  before  the  incident"  (our  translation  from  the
     Afrikaans original). In addition, the complainants  had  not  sustained
     any physical injuries or psychological harm.
     The court then held that the following constituted a  "substantial  and
     compelling circumstance":


     "Although there was intercourse with each complainant more  than  once,
     this was the result of the virility of a young man still at school  who
     had intercourse with other school pupils  against  their  wishes,  and,
     note, school pupils who had previously been  sexually  active...  Where
     one is dealing with school pupils, and where, in addition,  it  appears
     that the two girls concerned had already had  intercourse  before,  one
     really shouldn't lose perspective, especially not in  relation  to  the
     first count, which dealt with a complainant who had in any  event  been
     naughty a few days earlier and had intercourse with someone  else.  The
     injustice which she suffered in this case does not demand an  unusually
     severe sentence." [Translation from Afrikaans original.]


     This judgment has a chilling effect,  both  in  terms  of  its  general
     approach and  its  conclusion  regarding  "substantial  and  compelling
     circumstances".  In his  interpretation  of  the  Act  and  the  phrase
     "substantial and compelling circumstances",  Kotze  J  perpetuates  the
     very myths surrounding rape that one would have hoped to see our courts
     discarding, ie that rape isn't traumatic for a woman unless  there  are
     physical  scars  and  injury  to  show  for  it,  that  there  are   no
     psychological consequences where a woman has been sexually active prior
     to the rape and that so-called "rape"  is  often  merely  a  matter  of
     misunderstood male virility.


     * In  its  submission  to  the  Committee,  the  Community  Law  Centre
     expressed the view that, in the consideration  by  judges  of  what  is
     "substantial  and  compelling  circumstances",  the  following  factors
     should not be taken into account:-


     * whether the complainant has been sexually active;
     * whether the complainant and accused know each other or  are  related;
       and
     * whether any real physical injury was sustained by the complainant.
     Appeals from the Regional Court and the Sexual Offences Courts
     O The President of the Regional Court in the Western Cape  reported  to
     the Committee that, from 11 February 1997 till the present,  about  850
     matters were finalised in the Sexual Offences courts in Wynberg.  There
     were only about 40-45 appeals against convictions of which only 14 were
     successful.
     O Concern was expressed about a recent increase in the setting aside of
     convictions and the reduction of sentences  on  appeal,  especially  in
     view of the fact that magistrates had the best opportunity to assess  a
     witness's performance, an advantage a presiding judge  on  appeal  does
     not have. The President of the  Regional  Court  in  the  Western  Cape
     indicated that they were  particularly  concerned  about  such  appeals
     being granted by acting judges.
     O The Director of Public  Prosecutions  also  expressed  concern  about
     lenient sentences being handed down in matters where minimum  sentences
     were applicable, and indicated that his office were in the  process  of
     taking various of these judgements on appeal.
     Appointment of judges and disciplinary proceedings
     O The chairperson of the Parliamentary Justice Committee and member  of
     the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), Advocate Johnny de Lange, made a
     submission to  the  Committee  regarding  the  JSC's  approach  to  the
     appointment of judges.  The submission dealt, inter alia, with:-


     * The JSC, as the body charged  with  advising  the  President  on  the
     appointment of judges, constituted in  terms  of  Section  178  of  the
     Constitution: the Chief Justice, the President  of  the  Constitutional
     Court, a designated Judge President, the Cabinet member responsible for
     the  administration  of  justice,  two  practising  advocates  and  two
     practising  attorneys  nominated  from  their  respective   professions
     appointed by the President, one designated university teacher  of  law,
     six members of the National Assembly,  of  which  three  must  be  from
     opposition parties, four permanent delegates to the National Council of
     Provinces and four persons designated by the President.


     * The South African judiciary is composed as follows  (as  in  November
     1999):
     Number of permanent judges  in  13  divisions  (including  Land  Claims
     Courts, but excluding Labour Courts)
     194
     Women judges
     10
     Black judges (29 have been appointed since 1994)
     30


     Black judges who are heads of divisions (Chief Justice of Supreme Court
     of Appeal, Judge President of High Court in Transkei and  President  of
     the Land Claims Court)
     3


     * UWC's Community Law Centre pointed out in  their  submission  that  a
     demographically representative judiciary does not  guarantee  race  and
     gender sensitivity.  The ideal is that every person on the  bench  must
     be sensitive to race and gender issues, irrespective of their own  race
     and gender.


     * The Chief Justice has formulated the criteria for the appointment  of
     judges as follows42:
     * Is the applicant an appropriately qualified person?
     * Is she or he a fit and proper person?
     * Would her or his appointment help to reflect the  racial  and  gender
     composition of South Africa?
     * Is the proposed appointee a person of integrity?
     * Is the proposed appointee a person  with  the  necessary  energy  and
     motivation?
     * Is the proposed appointee both technically competent and able to give
     expression to the values of the Constitution?
     * Has the proposed appointee the appropriate potential?
     * What message is given to the  community  at  large  by  a  particular
     appointment?
     o It  is  apparent  from  the  aforesaid  that  there  is  no  specific
     requirement for knowledge on and  sensitivity  to  issues  relating  to
     women and violence against women.


     O The President of the Regional Court in the Western Cape expressed the
     view to the Committee that judges were mostly  drawn  from  a  pool  of
     senior  advocates,  usually  men,  whose  experience  was   mainly   in
     commercial matters, and if they do have criminal experience, it was  as
     an  accused-orientated  defence  counsel.   They  were  therefore   not
     necessarily well-equipped to hear criminal trials and appeals.


     O The Commission on Gender Equality reported to the Committee  that  it
     was investigating the possibility of incorporating CGE into the JSC  to
     ensure the appointment of a more gender-sensitive judiciary.


     O The Minister of Justice advised the Committee that draft  legislation
     on disciplinary and grievance proceedings for judges had been finalised
     and is presently being circulated among the judiciary.


     Education of judges


     O Both the Department of Justice and  the  Chief  Director  of  Justice
     College reported that High Court judges resisted efforts to participate
     in training on the basis that it may compromise judicial  independence.
     However, the Department has  in  the  past  reported  on  its  Canadian
     Justice Linkage Project, a five-year judicial training  programme  that
     includes higher court judicial officers.43


     O Constitutional Court Judge Kate O'Regan presented  a  report  to  the
     Committee on her attendance at a judicial colloquium on the application
     of international human rights law at the domestic level. The communiquÿ
     adopted by the colloquium raised the following issues:


     * the need for countries to seek ways to ensure access for women to the
     justice system;
     * the need for lawyers, legislators, judges & citizens to recognize the
     importance of and be familiar with  international  and  regional  human
     rights law;
     * judicial education: calling "for all judges to engage in an  on-going
     process of comprehensive, in-depth and credible judicial  education  to
     integrate CEDAW, CRC and other international human  rights  instruments
     into domestic law and decision-making to enhance the social,  political
     and economic lives of  women  &  children  and  to  eradicate  violence
     against them", and "for Governments to support the judiciary  in  these
     efforts, including through the provision of adequate resources";
     * education for lawyers and citizens on human rights;
     * the establishment of an international judicial education  centre  "to
     assist countries in the design, development and  delivery  of  judicial
     education programmes on  international  human  rights  instruments  and
     jurisprudence", as well as "an international resource centre to  advise
     and assist law-makers, judicial officers, prosecutors  and  lawyers  in
     developing specific practices and processes required to  implement  and
     integrate international human rights instruments  into  their  domestic
     legal systems".


     * LAW ENFORCEMENT
     Previous commitments and recommendations
     o In its White Paper on Safety and Security in 1998, the Department  of
     Safety and Security stated that service delivery is a  key  aspect  for
     women who have often faced secondary victimisation from the SAPS in the
     past.  To give effect to various victim's rights (including  the  right
     to be treated with respect and dignity, the right to legal  advice  and
     the right to protection), "specific guidelines for use at station level
     should be developed to ensure that in cases in which  women  have  been
     victims of sexual offences, rape or domestic violence they are  treated
     with extra dignity, compassion and  care".   The  White  Paper  further
     stated that these aspects would be developed in line with the  existing
     initiatives  of  the  Victim  Empowerment  Programme  (VEP)  under  the
     National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS).44
     o In its November 1998 report on Government's Implementation  of  CEDAW
     and the BPA, the Committee recorded that it had  received  no  response
     from either the Minister of Safety  and  Security  or  the  Independent
     Complaints Directorate (ICD) to its  May  1998  letters  requesting  an
     update on programmes to  combat  violence  against  women,  details  of
     budgetary allocations for implementation of  such  programmes  and  the
     implementation by the SAPS of certain recommendations made by the ICD.
     o In the 1998 report of the ICD45 on the conduct of members of the SAPS
     made, inter alia, the following recommendations46:
     * The SAPS should embark on an extensive training programme,  aimed  at
     improving the member's understanding of the nature and consequences  of
     violence against women, the context within which such  violence  occurs
     and  is  aimed  at  enhancing  the   member's   capacity   to   respond
     appropriately to such complaints.
     * Suitably trained officers should be attached to each police  station.
     Complainants should be offered a choice of a male or female  member  to
     assist in the initial stages of the investigation.
     * Each police station should have a list  of  organisations  that  deal
     with violence against women.
     * The SAPS should  review  its  mechanisms  regarding  the  release  of
     information to the media so as not to discriminate  against  women  and
     not to invade their privacy.
     o The Committee urgently requires a response from the SAPS and the  ICD
     as to whether any of the above recommendations have been implemented.
     Present experiences of the SAPS
     o Numerous submissions to the Committee indicated that the SAPS remains
     inaccessible, insensitive47 and ineffective48  in  preventing  violence
     against women and assisting victims of violence, thereby decreasing the
     reporting of the crime and prosecution of attackers.  The  difficulties
     can roughly be categorised  as  problems  of  attitude  and  abuse  and
     operational problems.
     Attitudes and abuse
     o Submissions described police as accusatory (Why did you go with him";
     "You should not walk in that area alone"; "You know what happens at the
     shebeens, you shouldn't have been there"), hostile ("you're wasting  my
     time... come back when you get your story straight"; "what do you  want
     us to do about it?";  "why did you wash yourself?")  and  uncooperative
     ("find him and then come back to us"; "sit there until a female officer
     arrives to help you")49.
     o Police were accused of trying to dissuade women from  laying  charges
     against perpetrators by stressing  negative  outcomes/consequences  for
     women if they insist on the arrest of the offender.50
     o Women also complained of poor police service  in  cases  of  domestic
     violence, and two thirds of those  who  had  gone  to  the  police  had
     difficulty  in  convincing  the  police  that  they  were  in  need  of
     protection or were not treated seriously:   in  80%  of  cases,  police
     arrived hours later or the next day when called to the  scene;  34%  of
     women were told to "stop wasting police  time",  26%  were  accused  of
     provoking the violence, 39% were accused of lying; 74% were expected to
     give statements in not  their  first  language;   43%  were  told  that
     charges could not be laid due to lack of evidence;  police also  failed
     to inform women on procedure, to update them,  or  to  investigate  the
     complaint properly;  55% of  complainants  were  told  to  "find  their
     attacker" before the police would arrest him.51
     o The Commission on Gender Equality complained of the SAPS's failure to
     take complainants seriously, even ridiculing complainants,  failure  to
     provide sanctuary to complainants,  failure  to  attempt  to  apprehend
     abusers where warrants have been issued, and demanding  that  survivors
     accompany police to point out perpetrators.
     o Police, on the other hand, complained of women  withdrawing  charges,
     lack  of  resources  &  transport,  non-cooperation   of   victims   in
     investigations, "false complaints", and laws which limit police's right
     to enter the respondent's home.
     o Various allegations were also made about sexual  advances  by  police
     officers.52  It was also reported to the Committee that many  policemen
     are vulnerable to bribery by offenders53, resulting in case files going
     missing, thus hampering the investigation and ultimately justice.54
     o It is a requirement of CEDAW that government should take measures  to
     ensure that law enforcement officers receive training to sensitise them
     to the needs of women.55
     o The National Network on Violence Against Women reported  that,  while
     it is recognised that training will facilitate the development of  more
     humane treatment of  women  by  police  and  other  officials,  gender-
     sensitive training has in the past  not  resulted  in  gender-sensitive
     practices in the police workplace.  There is thus a  need  to  evaluate
     the outcome of training, and its application in the workplace.
     o Tswaranang Legal Advocacy Centre to End Violence Against  Women  made
     the point that the mainly military training of police  does  not  equip
     them to deal sensitively with issues of violence against women.
     o In a written submission, the National Police Commissioner advised the
     Committee that a training programme had been developed to equip members
     with basic knowledge and skills in this area and all SAPS members would
     be trained in this over the next two years.
     o The Department of Safety and Security reported56 to the Committee the
     following efforts to address crimes against women and children:-
     * the SAPS has declared crimes against women and  children  a  policing
     priority for the third consecutive year;
     * a "national instruction" has been issued with regard to  the  support
     of sexual offences and crucial aspects of the investigation thereof.  A
     video-recording of this national instruction was  made  and  distribute
     countrywide;
     * basic training, detective training and specialised  training  courses
     (on, for example, the investigation of sexual offences, family violence
     and child protection) are in  place  for  members  of  the  SAPS,  with
     special attention to dealing with women survivors;
     * the SAPS is represented  at  Interpol's  Standing  Working  Party  on
     Offences Against Minors.
     Operational problems
     o There still appears to be a gross discrepancy in the distribution  of
     police stations in historically disadvantaged areas, and in particular,
     in rural areas.  It was reported to the Committee that permanent police
     stations feature in only 14% of historically black areas and in 86%  of
     historically white areas.  The main service providers  in  black  areas
     are satellite stations and contact points.57   The  majority  of  South
     African women reside many miles from  the  nearest  police  station  or
     magistrate's court, limiting their access to justice.
     o It was reported that policemen refuse to respond to calls by women by
     saying that they do not have vehicles to come to the complainant.58
     o The National Network on Violence Against Women submitted  that  there
     are too few female police officers to counsel  survivors  of  violence,
     and that they received repeated requests by women  for  counselling  by
     female officers.
     o Women described such difficult experiences as waiting  for  hours  at
     the police station, having to repeat their story to  various  different
     police officers, not having statements taken in their  first  language,
     and poor follow-up about arrests, detention or  bail  hearings  of  the
     accused.59
     o The Office of the DPP emphasised that police need to  be  trained  on
     the techniques of collecting DNA evidence and its preservation.60  They
     need training on how to deal with traumatised victims and children when
     asking questions particularly  as  most  rapes  are  not  committed  by
     strangers but by those close to the victims, such as relatives.
     o The Police Commissioner also told the Committee that police  stations
     are in the process of becoming more victim-friendly and that R1 million
     had been allocated for  rape  victim  care  packages  containing  basic
     toiletries.
     o Concern was also expressed  about  the  SAPS's  compliance  with  the
     Domestic Violence Act,  which  comes  into  operation  on  15  December
     1999.61  By way of example, the DVA makes provision for the complainant
     to receive a notice of her rights in her official language and to  have
     the contents thereof  explained  to  her.   Most  police  stations  are
     understaffed and no more than three official languages are spoken.   It
     did not appear  as  if  additional  personnel  had  been  allocated  to
     stations for the implementation of  the  DVA,  nor  had  strategies  to
     address this issue been developed.
     o The National Police Commissioner  advised  the  Committee  that  SAPS
     national  instructions  have  been  compiled  in  preparation  for  the
     implementation of the DVA and that all SAPS members must be trained  in
     terms of these instructions.
     o The Department of Safety and Security also reported to the  Committee
     the efforts of the SAPS to  transform  its  existing  Child  Protection
     Units into specialised Family Violence,  Child  Protection  and  Sexual
     Offences Units.
     * These FCS units are responsible for policing the  crimes  of  assault
     with the intention to do grievous bodily harm and attempted murder of a
     victim older than 18 years where the crime is committed in the  context
     of a family.  The units also have  jurisdiction  over  sexual  offences
     (where the victim is 18 and older) including  rape,  indecent  assault,
     incest and violation of the Sexual Offences Act62 with  regard  to  the
     sexual exploitation of adults.  The FCS units are also  responsible  to
     police the following crimes where the victim is under the  age  of  18:
     rape, indecent assault, sodomy, incest, attempted murder, assault  with
     the intention to do grievous bodily harm, common assault  (where  three
     or more incidents occur  in  the  context  of  a  family),  kidnapping,
     abduction, violation of the Sexual Offences  Act  with  regard  to  the
     sexual exploitation of children, the Child Care Act63 and the Films and
     Publication Act64 relating to child pornography.
     * Fourteen of these FCS units are already operational.   There  are  27
     Child Protection Units and four Indecent Crime Units  situated  in  the
     main centres, while specialised SAPS members attached to the  Detective
     Service operate in 156 smaller centres across the  country.   Where  no
     such special unit or individual is operational, members  at  the  local
     detective service or police station police the crimes.
     * Members of the  FCS  units  receive  a  three  week  training  course
     presented   by   experts   including   psychologists,   criminologists,
     advocates, medical practitioners and senior police officers.
     o The following issues still has to be addressed by the  Department  of
     Safety and Security:-
     * the development of a profile of rape survivors and perpetrators;
     * disciplinary action against members of the SAPS  who  are  themselves
     perpetrators of violence against women;
     * the technical aptitude of investigating officers in the investigation
     of charges of violence against women, especially rape;
     * the establishment of specialised units for rape  and  other  violence
     against women and children;  and
     * the Department's participation in trauma centres for rape survivors.
     * WELFARE SERVICES AND SHELTERS
     o The February 1996 Beijing Cabinet commitments  relating  to  violence
     against women include:-
     * the provision of shelters and relief support to women and girls65;
     * increasing the understanding of policymakers and implementers of  the
     impact of violence on women and girls;  and
     * encouraging the media to present positive images of women.
     Counselling and shelters
     o  Participants  in  the  hearings  reported  an  absence   of   proper
     counselling for women who are survivors of violence.  It appeared  that
     officials  and  professionals  were  not  adequately  trained  to  give
     meaningful assistance to survivors of violence.  It was  also  reported
     to the Committee that young women face additional  difficulties,  since
     schools are reluctant to deal with sexual assault and  see  rape  as  a
     "police issue" while families tend to "hide" the problem.66
     o NGO's and CBO's also reported a severe lack of temporary safe housing
     for women as a  means  of  escaping  situations  of  violence.67   This
     Commission for Gender Equality called for the urgent  establishment  of
     shelters in especially rural areas.
     o Nisaa reported to the Committee that, at present, most  shelters  are
     funded  by  overseas  donor  agencies.   They  submitted  that  it   is
     imperative that South African shelters begin to find local  funding  in
     the  interest  of  sustainability.  Since  many  NGO's  have  developed
     considerable expertise in running shelters, Nisaa is of the  view  that
     NGO's should run the services with government funding, and  NGO's  thus
     being accountable to government.
     o The University of Cape Town's Institute of Criminology's Gender,  Law
     and Development Project presented a submission on  research  undertaken
     in rural areas in the Southern Cape, and drew the following findings to
     the committee's attention:
     *  Participants  reported  fear  of  retaliation,  public  humiliation,
     ostracism by family and friends and little  faith  in  the  police  and
     courts.
     * Women reported little or no support from  family  or  the  community;
     women were often too scared of retaliation to help other women,  family
     members blamed the victim for not being obedient enough,  with  further
     retaliation from the abuser who has  now  been  humiliated  before  his
     family.
     * Participants reported little or no  assistance  from  social  workers
     from local welfare agencies, namely the Department of Welfare  and  the
     Christelike Maatskaplike Raad (both of which prioritised child  abuse):
     women expressed a strong need for more  and  better  domestic  violence
     counselling and shelters.
     o The Gender Advocacy Project (GAP) stated in their written  submission
     to the Committee that support  services  such  as  shelters,  financial
     support,  legal  assistance,  police  protection,  access  to  housing,
     education, training, employment opportunities,  psychological  services
     were essential to assist women to transcend the cycle of abuse.
     o The Welfare Ministry reported  to  the  Committee  on  the  following
     achievements and proposed projects:-
     * A service directory for  police  and  other  professionals  has  been
     developed.
     * "One-stop service"  shelters  were  being  planned.   The  Department
     intends piloting these shelters in under-resourced provinces.
     * The Department had embarked on training of  SAPS  and  Department  of
     Justice officials on the provisions of  the  DVA.  Training  of  social
     workers and volunteers would take place in January/February 2000.
     * The Department was planning public education and awareness  campaigns
     on the DVA, and was also in the process of informing provincial Welfare
     Departments.
     * The Victim Empowerment Programme (VEP), a key programme of the inter-
     ministerial  National  Crime  Prevention  Strategy  (NCPS),  has   been
     launched and R6 million allocated to the VEP.  Provinces  and  projects
     responsive to  needs  of  women  and  girls  receive  priority  in  the
     allocation of funds.  42 service centres for victims of  violence  were
     already operational and had been allocated funding  of  R2,25  million.
     The funding of nine outreach  centres  in  the  provinces  is  detailed
     below.
     o In the White Paper on Social Welfare of 1997 guidelines for  strategy
     include strategies to  counteract  all  forms  of  abuse  and  violence
     against women, support services for women who have been battered, raped
     and sexually abused, the training of police officers,  magistrates  and
     criminal justice personnel in the management of violence against women,
     gender sensitive welfare services and taking into account women's needs
     as care givers.
     o The Department of Welfare indicated to  the  Committee  in  its  1998
     progress report that it was encouraging the media to  present  positive
     images of women through a "white ribbon  campaign"  and  the  "taxi-net
     campaign".68
     o The Department of Justice reported  to  the  Committee  that  it  has
     established a 24 hour helpline for abused women.
     o The following issues remain to be  addressed  by  the  Department  of
     Welfare:
     * the Department's efforts to ensure that women are  not  discriminated
     against with regard to welfare grants and  properly  regarded  as  main
     care provider, in particular in situations where the husband  is  alive
     but absent or unemployed;
     * the Department's efforts to ensure the allocation of  more  funds  to
     care dependency grants for seriously impaired children.
     Transport
     o  Various  submissions  described  the  difficulties  experienced   by
     especially rural women in accessing health care and legal services  due
     to in accessibility of transport.
     o UCT's Institute of Criminology's Gender, Law  &  Development  Project
     reported69 to the Committee that, in  a  study  conducted  among  rural
     women in the Southern Cape, almost 35% of women travel to or from  work
     in the dark in rural areas.  It was also found that 54% of historically
     disadvantaged groups walk to and from work on foot.
     o The Department of Transport was not requested  by  the  Committee  to
     participate in the hearings.   The  Committee  intends  requesting  the
     Department to furnish it with its  formal  response  to  the  following
     issues70, with reference to  its  White  Paper  on  National  Transport
     Policy of 1996:-
     * the Department's efforts to make public transport more accessible and
     affordable to women, who rely on these services for access  to  justice
     and health care services;
     * the Department's efforts to improve  transport  within  villages  and
     towns, as well as transport to and from rural areas;
     * the Department's efforts to ensure the safety of women on the  public
     transport system, with particular  reference  to  more  conductors  and
     alarm cords on trains,  safe  waiting  places  at  train  stations  and
     special measures for transport services after standard commuter times.
     * HEALTH CARE
     Medico-legal examinations
     o  Various  submissions  to  the  Committee   reported   on   practical
     difficulties experienced with the required medico-legal examination  of
     the victims of sexual assault and rape:
     *  Health  care  services  are   disproportionately   concentrated   in
     historically white and urban centres.  Most district  surgeons  in  the
     rural areas  work  part-time,  combining  their  official  duties  with
     private practice.71
     * A concomitant lack of access, mainly transport, especially for  rural
     women. UCT's Institute of Criminology's  Gender,  Law  and  Development
     Project reported that rural women were severely affected by the lack of
     operational telephones, long distances to  travel  to  police  stations
     (which are often inaccessible and poorly resourced) and to clinics  and
     hospitals.72  Police  are  supposed  to  transport  women  to  district
     surgeons, but seldom do so, partly as a result of  shortage  of  police
     vehicles.73
     * Lengthy waiting periods74 between reporting the crime to  the  police
     and the medical examination, which  not  only  compounds  the  victim's
     trauma, but is also a deterrent to proceeding  with  criminal  charges.
     One research report showed that only 54,8% of survivors  were  examined
     within 3 hours of reporting to the police.75
     * A lack of privacy during the medical examination and a failure on the
     part of district surgeons to explain the reasons for and nature of  the
     examination, often due to linguistic problems;76
     * Inadequate treatment for  conditions  such  as  HIV/AIDS,  STD's  and
     pregnancy, or treatment without even the most basic of explanations  of
     the  health  risks  faced  by  rape  survivors.   Often  the  necessary
     treatment, such as post-exposure prophylaxis, is  not  available.   The
     absence of pre- and post - HIV test counselling was also reported.77
     * The President of the Regional Court in the Western Cape further  told
     the  Committee  that  district  surgeons  often  lack   expertise   and
     equipment;  there have also been cases  where  district  surgeons  have
     refused to examine drunk & drugged  victims.   The  Masimanyane  report
     admitted reluctance on the part  of  district  surgeons  to  appear  in
     court, and  there  was  even  the  suggestion  that  district  surgeons
     deliberately completed the J88 form in an inadequate  manner  to  avoid
     being called as a witness.
     * A specific request was tabled by the President of the Regional  Court
     to remove question 11(e) ("date of last intercourse with consent") from
     Form J88 on the basis that it is an unnecessary invasion of the privacy
     of the survivor.
     o Traditionally, forensic evidence collected by the health workers  has
     not been adequate for the prosecution of alleged offenders.   The  Head
     of the Sexual Offences and Community Affairs Unit in the Office of  the
     Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  reported  to  the  Committee  on  a
     successful pilot project in  Kimberley,  which  provided  training  for
     forensic nurses to collect evidence and give expert  evidence  in  rape
     and sexual assault trials.  The Office of the DPP indicated that  their
     view was that forensic training had to be extended to nurses and  where
     possible they should be able to give  expert  evidence,  especially  in
     rural areas, where there is a shortage of medical facilities.
     Physical and psychological aspects of treatment of victims of violence
     o It further appeared  that  few  health  care  workers  were  properly
     equipped to deal with both the physical and  psychological  aspects  of
     the treatment of women and  children  who  were  victims  of  violence,
     especially sexual violence.
     o The  Women's  Health  Project  reported  that  most  of  the  general
     practitioners surveyed by them felt inadequate in  coping  with  issues
     surrounding domestic violence.  Thirty-three percent  of  the  GPs  who
     attended the course reported that they saw women in violent  situations
     almost on a daily basis and a further 13 % saw them  at  least  once  a
     week.  Sixty two percent of the doctors saw women who  had  been  raped
     more than once a month.  Where the GPs could  deal  with  the  physical
     aspects such as rape and injury, they were wary and  felt  ill-equipped
     to deal  with  "private"  aspects  of  the  problem  such  as  offering
     counselling and referring the survivor to social structures that  could
     offer assistance (such as legal institutions and shelters).
     o Ilitha Labantu reported that district  surgeons  and  hospitals  were
     only concerned about rape victims when  the  survivor  showed  physical
     injuries.
     o The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions  (DPP)  raised  the
     issue that medical students must be trained properly on how to  examine
     sexually assaulted victims.
     o It also appeared that health workers  were  perfectly  positioned  to
     assist women who are victims of violence, with a  significant  majority
     of women informing the health  care  worker  who  treats  them  of  the
     identity of their abuser.78
     o Many health workers, however, are not trained to deal with issues  of
     violence and an education  and  counselling  opportunity  is  therefore
     missed.79  Women's Health Project reported to the Committee that, while
     the Department of Health recognises the  problem  of  violence  against
     women and intends to develop programmes, there is no  institutionalised
     training at present in the medical or nursing curriculum or  in-service
     training to prepare health workers to deal with violence against women.
      This is borne out  by  the  fact  that  only  10%  of  health  workers
     routinely ask clients about domestic violence:   the  reasons  for  not
     inquiring about abuse were feeling professionally and  personally  ill-
     equipped to deal with such  problems  (40%),  perceptions  that  it  is
     unnecessary (47%) and being too busy (13%).
     o In the Department of Health's 1998 progress report to the  Committee,
     the Department stated that it had joined other countries to  discuss  a
     resolution on the prevention of violence as a public  health  priority,
     that it participates in the National Network on Violence Against  Women
     and that it assisted in developing guidelines for survivors  of  sexual
     offences.
     o The following issues80 remain to be addressed by  the  Department  of
     Health:
     * the necessity of shifting the focus of health care services for women
     from childbearing to reproductive  health,  including  counselling  and
     education  on  and  treatment  for   reproductive   health,   including
     infertility, sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  especially  violence
     against women;  and
     * training and education of health care workers in domestic violence as
     a mainstream health issue.
     HIV / AIDS and violence against women
     o Women and children who have been the  victims  of  sexual  abuse  and
     violence  face  special  risks  of  contracting  sexually   transmitted
     diseases (STDs), and in particular HIV/AIDS.
     o The violence and coercion involved in the sexual relationships of  so
     many men and women in  South  Africa  limit  especially  young  women's
     capacities to  protect  themselves  against  HIV/AIDS.81   In  research
     conducted  among  women  in  three  South  African  provinces82,  CERSA
     reported that many women indicated that their  partner  openly  brought
     girlfriends home or boasted  about  them,  and  that  even  more  women
     indicated that they did not perceive that they were able to refuse  sex
     with their husbands.  Given the pattern of gender  relations  described
     in this research, it is likely that women would not be in a position to
     insist on condom use, even if  they  wanted  to,  and  in  relationship
     characterised by physical violence they faced further abuse.
     o Various perverse myths have arisen during the last decade  connecting
     sex with certain types of women with a cure for AIDS, thereby adding  a
     new dimension to sexual violence against women.  In  1990,  a  document
     appeared calling on African men in the Durban area to acquire "the AIDS
     antibody" by raping Indian women.  Even though the flyer  was  believed
     to be the work of a "third force" intent on aggravating conflict in and
     between black communities, it still succeeded in  increasing  the  fear
     surrounding the disease.  There is also a well-circulated myth that sex
     with a child virgin will cure oneself of the virus.83
     o Lisa Vetten writes84 that, although it is extremely hard  to  show  a
     correlation between the incidence of rape and  suspected  or  confirmed
     HIV positivity, the desire the spread the disease to  ensure  one  does
     not die alone, coupled with anecdotes like those  above,  does  suggest
     that HIV/AIDS needs to seriously considered  in  trying  to  understand
     factors giving rise to rape in South Africa.  Certainly, it would  seem
     that rapists may be targeting younger girls and children in the  belief
     that, being less sexually active, they are also less likely to  be  HIV
     positive.
     o Government funding of the controversial anti-retroviral  drug  AZT  -
     widely used in the treatment of AIDS - for rape survivors has  received
     much attention in the media and from the public during the last months.
     o In an address to the National  Assembly  on  16  November  1999,  the
     National Minister of Health, Dr M E Tshabalala-Msimang, indicated  that
     it is conservatively estimated that up to four million South  Africans,
     approximately 10% of our population, have been infected  with  the  HIV
     virus.  The Department of Health reported in 1999 that young  women  in
     there 20s have the highest infection rates. 26,1% and 26,9% of pregnant
     women aged 10-14 and 25-29 respectively are HIV positive.85
     o The Minister further stated in her address that the  government  does
     not supply AZT (which is  generally  used  in  conjunction  with  other
     drugs) to people infected with HIV/AIDS  (including  pregnant  mothers)
     and people who may have been infected through needle-pricks or  through
     rape, on two grounds:-
     * Affordability.  In her address to Parliament, the Minister stated "We
     simply cannot afford AZT.  At current market prices  the  cost  of  the
     triple therapy drugs alone, for the treatment  of  four  million  South
     Africans, would be ten  times  the  total  South  African  health  care
     budget, and 140 times what we spend on pharmaceuticals  in  the  public
     sector."
     * The absence of proper research on the possible  harmful  side-effects
     of AZT, in particular its toxic profile.
     o With regard to the treatment of rape survivors, the Minister said the
     following:
     "I must draw your attention to the fact that AZT is not registered  for
     this particular use in South Africa, or to the best  of  my  knowledge,
     anywhere else in the world.86
     "It is extremely unusual to expose healthy adults or children to a drug
     like AZT, that was developed for use in chemotherapy, and that is known
     to have caused cancer in animal studies.  Few drugs on our  market  are
     known carcinogens in animal models, and those that are, are mainly used
     to treat patients with established serious conditions such  as  cancer,
     where their effects have been carefully studied in clinical trials, and
     where their use is strictly controlled.
     "We have absolutely no idea of what the effects are, either  short-term
     or long-term, of using AZT, a known carcinogen, on healthy people.  The
     use of AZT is, at the  present  time,  illegal,  aside  from  it  being
     dangerous."
     * INCARCERATION OF OFFENDERS
     o The Department furnished the Committee with  the  following  relevant
     statistics87 about prisoners presently in the care of the Department:-
     * There are 12 034 prisoners convicted of sexual offences - 11% of  the
     total sentenced prisoner population.
     * There are 4 111 sentenced  and  unsentenced  female  prisoners:   871
     (21,1%) have been convicted of murder,  516  (12,6%)  of  assault,  347
     (8,4%) of narcotics-related crimes, and 326 (7,9%) of fraud.
     * The average age of female prisoners was 30,77 years, and the  average
     sentence of those already sentenced was 36,38 months.   There  are  315
     infants in prison in the care of female prisoners.
     * As at 30 April 1999, the number of HIV-positive prisoners was 1  789,
     a 25,46% increase from the number of 1 426 in May 1998.
     o The Department of Correctional Services presented a  submission88  to
     the Committee describing their extensive education  and  rehabilitative
     counselling programmes for inmates89, and in particular perpetrators of
     sexual violence.  Convicted rapists receive counselling  and  treatment
     from psychologists as they have been identified as  a  priority  target
     group.  The Department conceded that their rehabilitative efforts  were
     difficult to measure due to a lack of statistical support.
     o The Department reported  on  their  education  programmes  for  women
     inmates (such as programmes on  adult  basic  education  and  training,
     reproductive health, including HIV/AIDS, parenting skills,  and  stress
     and anger management, alcohol and drug  abuse).   The  Department  also
     makes use of NGO's, such as People Opposed  to  Women  Abuse  who  hold
     workshops on violence for female offenders who have  committed  violent
     crimes.
     o Departmental policy stipulates that mothers with  infants  and  young
     children90 must be kept in a separate  Mother  and  Child  Unit,  where
     surrounding and facilities are complementary to sound physical,  social
     and mental care and development of the child.
     o It was also reported that the Department now had a programme in place
     by which all reasonable efforts were made  to  notify  victims  of  the
     parole hearings, release or escape of prisoners.  Victims may make oral
     representations at parole hearings without the prisoner being  present,
     or written representations.   The  victim  may  also  request  to  have
     certain  conditions  included  in  the  prisoner's  parole  conditions,
     especially in rape and child abuse cases, such as that the offender  is
     restricted from certain public or residential areas.
     o The Department's submission points out that a victim or  relative  is
     responsible to inform the  Commissioner  of  Correctional  Services  in
     writing of her contact details, changes of address, and costs  incurred
     to attend the parole board hearing.
     o The Department also attempts to assist prisoners about to be  release
     by way of counselling, accommodation  and  transport  arrangements  and
     community  integration  programmes  to  assist  prisoners   to   obtain
     employment on release.
     * RECENT RESEARCH ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
     o Several research reports were  presented  to  the  Committee  at  the
     hearings.  The findings, which appear important to the  Committee,  are
     summarised below.  The Committee requests that these  summaries  should
     not be used without reference to the entire research reports, copies of
     which are available from the Committee clerk.  It is  always  necessary
     to take into account the limitations of such research, which  were  all
     conducted in specific geographic areas, and to recognise the danger  of
     generalisation.  These difficulties only highlight the dire need for  a
     proper statistical database on  issues  relating  to  violence  against
     women and children and gender attitudes.
     o UNISA's Institute for Social and Health Sciences presented a research
     report  on  rape  surveillance  through  district  surgeon  offices  in
     Johannesburg from  January  1996  to  December  1998.   Some  of  their
     findings on an analysis of 1401 rape cases reported  at  the  Hillbrow,
     Lenasia South and Chris Hani Baragwanath  medico-legal  clinics  during
     this period were the following:
     * 51% of survivors were between ages 15 and 25;
     * 80% of survivors were African, 10,2% Coloured, 8,1%  White  and  1,8%
     Asian;
     * 88,3% of rapes were perpetrated by a person of the same race group as
     the survivor;
     * 58,2% of rapes occurred  over  the  weekend,  and  43,7%  took  place
     between 18h01 and 0h00, i.e. most rapes took place after working  hours
     and after dark;
     * 44,7% of survivors were acquainted with their attacker in  some  way:
     21,9% of victims knew their attacker by  sight,  5,7%  were  "friends",
     4,2% were relatives, 3,4% were  ex-boyfriends,  3,1%  neighbours,  1,5%
     family acquaintances, 1,2% boyfriends and 0,8% co-workers91;
     * Younger victims were more likely to know their attackers:   offenders
     were known to 57,4% of victims between ages 1 to 12, 53,8%  of  victims
     between 13 to 19 years (the perpetrator was unknown to 61,6% of victims
     between 20 to 30, 64% of 31 to 40, and 83,3% of those older than 50);
     * 31% of rapes were committed in open fields,  29,1%  in  the  rapist's
     home, and 14,2% in the victim's home.  32 cases occurred  in  Hillbrow,
     70 in the Johannesburg CBD, 60 in Lenasia, 50  each  in  Berea,  Orange
     Farm, Soweto, and 46 in Joubert Park;
     * A single perpetrator committed  73%  of  rapes,  while  27%  involved
     multiple attackers (two attackers - 13,6%, three attackers -  6,4%  and
     four attackers - 7%);
     * Where a single perpetrator was involved, 51,5% of  perpetrators  were
     known to their victims, and 48,2% of rapes occurred in homes (32,3%  in
     the rapist's home and 15,9% in the victim's home);
     * Where multiple attackers were involved,  75,1%  of  the  perpetrators
     were strangers to the victims, and 50,8% of  the  attacks  occurred  in
     public areas;
     * Weapons were used in 54,9% of attacks:   mostly  knives  (50,9%)  and
     firearms (35,3%).  In 85,5% of cases the weapon was  used  to  threaten
     only.
     o UCT's Institute of Criminology's Gender, Law and Development  Project
     presented a submission on research undertaken in  rural  areas  in  the
     Southern Cape92, which found that the statistics and dynamics  of  rape
     are similar in rural areas to those in urban centres,  but  significant
     differences are identified in access to justice  &  support  after  the
     attack.  Participating women estimated that 80% of women,  on  average,
     are victims of ongoing domestic violence.
     o Rural women experienced and witnessed  injuries  ranging  from  burns
     from boiling water to  severe  head  injuries,  resulting  in  loss  of
     hearing and sight.  Steel pipes,  sticks,  knives,  furniture,  boiling
     water, fists, pieces of timber and kitchen utensils were  all  used  on
     women  in  their  communities.   Participants  stated  that,  in  their
     community, men were "professionals" in  domestic  violence,  hitting  a
     woman on her body and not on her face, so that the injuries are not too
     identifiable, but when  she  has  been  accused  of  infidelity,  women
     sustain head and facial injuries "to make her ugly to other men".
     o One participant described the  domestic  sexual  abuse  of  a  family
     member as follows:
     "What can she do if  he  comes  home,  drunk,  kicking  the  door,  the
     children and everything has gone mad?  When she is sleeping,  he  turns
     up the music loud and come to her and makes her sleep  with  him.   And
     she only wants to please her husband but she does not like it.   He  is
     very aggressive in their bed with .  She does not believe  it's  really
     rape when it is her husband.  Neither does  he.   He  says  'you're  my
     wife, I can do what I want to do'.
     "Even if she says no, her husband gets cross and  hits  her  and  keeps
     doing what he wants to do.  It is very painful, but she  cannot  scream
     because her children are there.  That is why he  turns  on  the  music.
     But, she says her children know what is happening.  She can  hear  them
     crying.
     "She reports him to his family.  His family says 'what's wrong with you
     that you don't want to please your husband' or 'what are we supposed to
     do... you must have sex with your husband'.
     "Sometimes husbands listen but they mostly say it is  nonsense  and  if
     the women do not like it, they must leave the house.  What must we  do?
     Go to the police?  Even if you are  raped  by  a  stranger  they  don't
     believe you and now you must tell them  your  husband  is  raping  you?
     They are just as bad as the husbands.  They ridicule you too  and  tell
     you that you are full of shit and you are wasting their time.  You  can
     have scars on your face... bleeding... and the  police  will  send  you
     home to 'sort it out with him'.  Rape by your husband is only  real  in
     the law."
     o  Participants  listed  domestic  violence,  alcoholism,  under-   and
     unemployment, the rape of women and property crime as major problems in
     their communities.  Participants reported a link quantified at  75%  to
     100% between alcohol and violence in their communities:  Women reported
     that  the  highest  levels  of  crime  against  women   and   children,
     particularly sexual assault and rape, occurred in  close  proximity  to
     shebeens.  It also appeared that age restrictions  for  buying  alcohol
     were almost non-existent.
     o Rape and the sexual molestation of children were seen as the  biggest
     threats to women and girl children in the communities, not only due  to
     the violation of women's physical and sexual integrity, but also due to
     other consequences of rape, such as  death,  injury,  impregnation  and
     STD's.
     o Economic abuse was a notable feature of the  research,  and  included
     withholding money, stealing money earned by her,  throwing  the  victim
     and her children out of the home (or  threatening  to  do  so)  or  the
     practice of giving money to the eldest son (no matter how old  he  is).
     But most commonly, men gave money irregularly to the women  to  provide
     for their families, and women were subsequently beaten if  the  husband
     found meals or the home unsatisfactory.
     o Women listed the following causes  of  domestic  violence:   Lack  of
     respect for women, problems with children  (misbehaviour  or  neglect),
     unemployment and alcohol abuse,  suspicion  or  jealousy,  and  culture
     (with special reference to lobola).
     o The report lists the following reasons  for  the  limited  access  to
     justice for rural women:
     * Economic disempowerment  (as  a  result  of  lack  of  education  and
     unemployment) was mentioned as being the single factor,  which  prevent
     women from removing themselves from the domestic violence.  Most  women
     who participated in the research had no credit rating  or  no  cash  to
     draw on in an emergency.   These  financial  restrictions  resulted  in
     isolation and  domestic  "confinement",  and  dictated  their  physical
     mobility, access to education, recreation, where they could shop,  what
     they could buy and also access to each other.
     * Women in rural areas lack nearby services and the cost  of  transport
     decreases a woman's ability to leave violent situations  or  even  seek
     information or assistance to deal with the problem. Distances to  basic
     public services are great and child care is  a  problem  if  travel  is
     necessary. There are no or limited taxi and bus services and if they do
     exist they are expensive.
     * Limited access to state  and  private  health,  welfare  and  justice
     services results in systemic discrimination  by  the  state  in  almost
     every area of rural women's lives.
     * Women in rural areas have little option but to  remain  in  the  home
     with the offender because  there  are  no  accessible  safe  houses  or
     shelters. Rural women remain in abusive relationships because they have
     little access to economic resources.
     * Women in small rural communities articulate fears of community gossip
     or alienation from their communities if they seek assistance.
     * Women remain powerless over alcoholism within their communities.
     * Very few development services exist in rural communities.
     o The combined effects of poverty and violence for rural women  in  the
     Southern Cape create formidable barriers to  women's  equality,  mental
     and physical health, and their full  participation  in  civil  society.
     Current law contains systemic inequalities, state legal structures  are
     inherently discriminatory against women and, more specifically, do  not
     meet the needs of rural women.93
     o The Medical Research Council's Centre for Epidemiological Research in
     SA ("CERSA") presented three research reports at  the  hearings,  which
     will be dealt with in turn below.
     o CERSA presented a research report on domestic violence based  on  the
     first major community-based prevalence study conducted among  women  in
     Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga & the Northern Province.94  Its main  findings
     were the following:-
     * emotional, financial  and  physical  abuse  are  common  features  of
     relationships and that many women have been raped;
     * physical violence often continues during pregnancy and constitutes an
     important cause of reproductive morbidity;
     * many women are injured by  their  partners  and  considerable  health
     sector resources are expended providing treatment for these injuries;
     * injuries result in costs being incurred in other sectors, notable  to
     the family and the women's community and to employers in  the  national
     economy.
     o The report's findings on the prevalence of violence against women  is
     demonstrated in the following table:-
     Eastern-Cape
     Mpumalanga
     Northern Cape
     Abuse by a current or ex-partner in the past
     26,8%
     28,4%
     19,1%
     Abuse by a current or ex-partner in the last year
     10,9%
     11,9%
     4,5%
     Rape
     4,5%
     7,2%
     4,8%
     Physical abuse during pregnancy
     9,1%
     6,7%
     4,7%
     o The study shows that considerable mental distress is associated  with
     abuse.  Of the women who reported being abused in the past year,  27,9%
     (Eastern  Cape),  24%  (Mpumalanga)  and  14,3%   (Northern   Province)
     indicated that they have suicidal thoughts.
     o When asked about women's perceptions of  culturally  accepted  gender
     relations, there was considerable  agreement  with  patriarchal  gender
     relations (including subservience of women to her  husband,  punishment
     of her by him in some situations,  male  ownership  of  women  and  the
     interpretation of beating as a sign of love), but women also  indicated
     that the prevailing gender attitudes in their  culture  was  much  more
     patriarchal than their personal views, and  a  considerable  number  of
     women disagreed with notions they conceded to be "culturally accepted",
     such as "if a man pays lobola for his wife she must have  sex  when  he
     wants it".  Only 57%  (Eastern  Cape),  40,4%  (Mpumalanga)  and  40,9%
     (Northern Cape) of women believed that a woman can refuse to  have  sex
     with her husband.  80,1% (Eastern Cape), 91,4% (Mpumalanga)  and  86,8%
     (Northern Cape) of women indicated that  a  man  hitting  his  wife  or
     girlfriend was never acceptable.
     o The report also mentions that  there  was  considerable  disagreement
     amongst the women about  the  meaning  attached  by  their  culture  to
     customs like lobola, indicating the possibility of  popular  discussion
     and examination of these traditions.
     o Research conducted amongst  pregnant  Xhosa-speaking  adolescents  in
     Khayelitsha95, initially intended to  focus  on  contraception,  bodily
     knowledge and pregnancy, found that male violence dominated the  sexual
     relationship of  these  women.   Conditions  and  timing  of  sex  were
     entirely defined by their male partners through the use of violence and
     through the circulation of certain constructions of  love,  intercourse
     and entitlement to which  the  women  were  expected  to  submit.   The
     research report also states that violence against  young  women  within
     their sexual  relationship  has  been  particularly  neglected  in  the
     spheres of  health  and  education.   Some  of  the  findings  are  the
     following:
     * First sexual encounters were mostly reported to have  occurred  at  a
     young age, often 12 years, with a male partner about 5 years older.
     * Many participants indicated that sex was a  strategy  to  avoid  peer
     ostracism,  and  the  mystifying  of  sex  and  its  mechanics  emerged
     repeatedly through a lack  of  input  by  sexually  experienced  female
     peers.
     * Women were therefore initiated into the sexual matters  by  men,  who
     repeatedly refused to explain what  was  about  to  take  place.   Most
     participants reported that they had been deceived or coerced into  sex,
     and that attempted resistance was  met  with  violence  or  threats  of
     violence.
     * 22 of the 24  participants  reported  having  been  beaten  by  their
     partners  on  multiple  occasions,  and  the  remaining  two  had  been
     threatened with assault.  The assault  occurred  primarily  when  women
     attempted  to  refuse  sexual  intercourse,  which  the  women   stated
     signified, in men's eyes, that the women  had  other  sexual  partners.
     Assault was perceived to be male strategy  for  "getting  you  to  love
     him".
     * Women said that the forced intercourse they  experienced  with  their
     partners could never be termed rape.
     * Many women continued intercourse and  did  not  attempt  to  end  the
     relationship because they feared more violence.  Despite the  violence,
     the men demonstrated material generosity in the form of  clothes,  food
     and money.  One participant said "it is alright as long as  he  doesn't
     beat me every day."
     * Most participants stated that they  felt  unable  to  discuss  sexual
     matters and contraception  with  their  male  partners,  and  for  some
     contraception appeared to be completely non-negotiable in view of angry
     responses by their male partners when the issue was raised.
     * Out of 24  adolescent  women,  only  two  mentioned  that  they  ever
     actively wanted to have sex now, but emphasises  that  women  were  not
     allowed to demonstrate desire or initiate sex.   Many  women  stated  a
     desire to be in a non-sexual relationship characterised by co-operation
     until they were older.
     o CERSA also reported on  research  conducted  among  young  people  in
     Umtata96.  Some of their key findings were the following:-
     * Many participants reported physical assault and rape or coercive sex.
      Out of the thirty 16-26 year olds who participated, 16 out of 22 girls
     reported assault by at least one male partner, and  6  out  of  8  boys
     admitted to having beaten their girlfriends on more than one occasion.
     * Violence was used by boys as  a  way  of  imposing  the  rules  of  a
     relationship and was particularly associated with girls' rejections  of
     "proposals of love", attempts to end relationships, refusals of sex and
     their actual or suspected infidelity.  Relationships were characterised
     by extreme suspicion around partners' activities with  others,  and  it
     appeared to be a common assumption that a refusal to have  sex  implied
     that the girl had another sexual partner.
     * Physical violence was a way of life for not only the  teenagers,  but
     in all community relationships.
     *  The  gender  identities  of  the  participants  were   substantially
     constructed in terms of their  success  in  sexual  relationships,  and
     pursuits of gaining and keeping boy- and girlfriends were  overwhelming
     preoccupations for these young people.
     * Neither teachers nor parents made any effort to promote  safe  dating
     or to  interfere  in  the  violent  activities.   Sexual  relationships
     between girls and male  teachers  were  commonly  reported,  and  often
     involved coercion and even violence on the part of the teachers.
     o A research report amongst male municipal workers in Cape  Town  aimed
     at establishing the prevalence of abuse as reported by men, as well  as
     risk factors associated with woman abuse. Some of the findings were the
     following:-
     * 44% of men reported having physically or sexually  abused  a  partner
     within the last 10 years - 8% reported physically abusing a partner  in
     the last year.
     * One third of the 44% said they had raped (more often) or attempted to
     rape their partner.
     * Men who reported physical and sexual abuse was five times more likely
     to use psychological abuse, four times more likely to use verbal  abuse
     and twice as likely to use economic abuse.
     * 75% of the abusers said it was "OK" to hit a woman, and  another  25%
     of those who didn't report abuse also agreed.  The circumstances  given
     by the men when it is "OK" to hit a woman were "when she  neglects  her
     responsibilities", "when there are no clean clothes",  "when  she  come
     home late", "when she don't listen" and "when she is cheeky".
     * The sample consisted of 64,7% Coloured men, 25.2% African, 8,6% white
     and 1,5% Asian men.  From this sample, abusers were more likely  to  be
     young and Coloured men, likely to have  been  in  jail,  to  have  been
     arrested, to have belonged to a gang;  non-abusers were likely to  have
     had education beyond standard 8 and likely to be active in religion.
     * Abusers acknowledged that their use of alcohol and  marijuana  was  a
     problem.
     * Witnessing abuse of their mothers by their fathers  as  a  child  was
     associated with being an abuser.   34,2%  of  men  who  reported  abuse
     reported  witnessing  their  mothers'  abuse  by  their  father  or   a
     boyfriend, while only 15,9% of men who did not report  abuse  witnessed
     such  behaviour.   38,5%  of  men  who  reported  abuse  also  reported
     witnessing their sisters' abuse by her husband or  a  boyfriend,  while
     21,2% of men who did not report abuse  witnessed  such  behaviour.   An
     average of 86,1% of  the  entire  sample  reported  receiving  physical
     punishment as a child - men related stories of  severe  discipline  and
     bizarre punishment in which their fathers had a central role.
     * The report mentions that, during their interviews, many  of  the  men
     became emotional when talking about their childhood and  the  abuse  of
     their mothers, and many said they had never had the opportunity to talk
     about it before.
     * It is apparent from the study that men's attitudes towards women  and
     their perceived roles influenced the reasons for conflict with partners
     in abusive  relationships.   In  relationships  where  there  was  less
     expectation that a woman should obey her partner,  less  of  belief  in
     male sexual entitlement, less fear of infidelity,  much  less  conflict
     was experienced.  Men reported "she sits on his head" or "she  answered
     him back" or "talking to other men" as reasons for conflict.
     * Many men reported being frustrated at work where they have to "accept
     the shit of the bosses".  One explained his frustration  of  not  being
     able to provide adequately for his family as "it is one of  the  things
     to be a man".
     * Most of the men did not think shouting and swearing at or humiliating
     a woman was a form of violence.
     o The Centre for Rural Legal Studies furnished  the  Committee  with  a
     research report on the plight of women  farm  workers  in  the  Western
     Cape.  The report recounts attitudes of violence and abuse  among  male
     farmworkers, reinforced by extreme financial dependence of women:
     * 67% of all employers stated that domestic violence  occurs  on  their
     farms.
     * 50,9% of employers agreed that they tacitly include a  male  worker's
     female partner in his employment  agreement,  while  60%  of  employers
     insist that a male worker's partner must be available to  work  on  the
     farm.
     * 52,4% of women  report  that  the  house  is  linked  to  their  male
     partner's contract.  48,6% of employers  stated  that,  should  a  male
     worker leave or die, his female partner would have to leave the farm.
     * Only 21,1% of women stated that they had access  to  legal  aid,  and
     more than half of women said it was extremely difficult to access these
     services during working hours.
     o The 1998  South  Africa  Demographic  and  Health  Survey97  reported
     statistics on violence against women that were significantly lower than
     those reported by other studies:-
     * 13% of women reported having been beaten by a partners, of which half
     reported abuse in the last year.
     * 43% of those who reported abuse in the  last  year  reported  needing
     medical attention as a result of such beatings.
     * Only 4% of women who had ever been pregnant reported  physical  abuse
     during pregnancy.
     * Only 4% of all women reported ever having been raped.
     o The Survey mentions that the under-reporting of  gender  violence  is
     well-recognised and should be taken into account  in  interpreting  its
     results, especially in view of other research by the MRC:
     "The  usual  explanations  for  under-reporting   are   concern   about
     recrimination, fear of identifying oneself as an abused woman due to  a
     socialisation that encourages women to accept chastisement  as  a  male
     prerogative, feelings of shame about the assault  and  having  provoked
     it, perceptions that it is a private matter and loyalty to the abuser."
     o The Survey also records that one  in  five  currently  married  women
     reported economic maltreatment, indicated by the regular  non-provision
     of money for food, rent or bills whilst having money for other things.
     * PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION
     o It emerged strongly from the hearings that rape, sexual  assault  and
     domestic violence are more prevalent in South African society than ever
     recognised98, and that fear and expectation of violence  is  a  way  of
     life for many South African women.
     "It's always present.  You never know when it  is  coming.   There  are
     times when you do and you have to just wait until he gets home and just
     does it.  Then it is over and you are relieved.   The  waiting  is  the
     worst part."99
     "We know the cycle well.  No one has to explain it to us.  You see  his
     mood rising ... he is anxious or angry or drunk  or  just  showing  his
     manliness to his friends ...it can be anything.  You are never prepared
     for it and you are always prepared for it. You never believe it when it
     happens even if it happens everyday.  He says he is sorry and will  not
     do it again and you feel relief, but you know the calm  before  another
     storm."100
     o The hearings also shattered the common myth  that  the  rapist  is  a
     stranger who lurks in dark alleys.  Research reports presented  to  the
     committee  clearly  showed  that  most  violence   against   women   is
     perpetrated by a person with whom the victim or survivor is  acquainted
     in some or other way.  Especially younger victims are much more  likely
     to know their attackers, with  57,4%  of  offenders  known  to  victims
     between ages 1 to 12, and 53,8% if victims between ages 13 to 19.101
     o Submissions  repeatedly  mentioned  our  history  of  oppression  and
     disregard for human rights as the context  in  which  violence  against
     women flourished, and emphasised the importance of addressing  violence
     against women by placing it both  within  a  historical  and  political
     perspective and to recognise the influence of apartheid in the  present
     mindset of individuals, communities and society as a whole.  There is a
     need to acknowledge the pain of the past and the influence this has  on
     the entire nation.  The fragmentation existing  within  communities  is
     indicative of the fragmentation of identity of  individuals;   violence
     against women is just one of the effects of such fragmentation.
     "We believe that one of the reasons why we are not seeing a  change  in
     attitude of the judiciary or why rape and domestic violence  is  almost
     condoned at community level, is because we have  not  created  adequate
     space in the transformation process for the acknowledgment of our  past
     traumas and a lack of adequate and appropriate mechanisms  for  healing
     the pain which every single citizen in this country has been  subjected
     to."102
     It was also argued that the division of  the  people  of  this  country
     according to race contributed to the  prevalence  of  violence  against
     women:  notions of racial superiority  and  separation  led  to  forced
     removals,  states  of  emergency  and  the   artificial   creation   of
     "homelands", thereby breaking up traditional family structures.103
     o In her submission104 to  the  Committee,  Lisa  Vetten  explored  the
     following factors contributing  to  violence  against  women  in  South
     Africa:-
     * Imbedded patriarchy:
     * Vetten describes this ideology of granting men  power  and  privilege
     over women as the one factor unifying South Africa's  various  cultural
     and ethnic groups.  Culturally imbedded patriarchal  gender  identities
     of women as receptive, caring, emotional, passive  and  submissive  and
     men  as  self-assertive,  competitive,  rational  and  aggressive  have
     resulted in the treatment of women  of  all  colours  as  second  class
     citizens, and women's confinement to the private  sphere  of  the  home
     while men are engaged in the public sphere of work,  community  affairs
     and politics.
     * These patriarchally determined gender identities manifests itself  in
     contemporary understandings of lobola. Since cash payments can  now  be
     made to the family, some men regard marriage as a financial transaction
     of "buying" a wife.
     * Patriarchy has severe economic consequences for women, who  are  much
     more likely to be unemployed and without access to any income of  their
     own, while men control the allocation of household  finances  and  even
     hamper women's efforts to obtain and  keep  employment,  leaving  women
     totally financially dependent.  Women's financial dependence on men was
     repeatedly  cited  in  submissions  as  the  main  reason  for  women's
     inability to remove herself and her children from  a  violent  domestic
     situation.
     * Submissions also mentioned deepening levels of poverty and inequality
     in post-apartheid South Africa, which most closely affects women as the
     major component of the unemployed in South Africa. Masimanyane said  in
     their submission to the Committee that economic deprivation  and  other
     political factors have destroyed people's identities and  eroded  their
     self-esteem and self-worth.105  Poverty also directly  affects  women's
     access to health care, the police and the criminal justice system.
     * CERSA also reported deep-rooted patriarchy and a concomitant lack  of
     respect for women, who are often seen as the property of their husbands
     or fathers or communities, as a  factor  in  the  scourge  of  violence
     against women. Authors have also  argued  that  violent  practices  are
     deployed by men against women in attempts to maintain particular  self-
     images and social evaluation in the face of real or  imagined  threats,
     i.e. to prove that they are "real men" and their women are under  their
     control.  In  particular  situations,  the  use  of  certain  forms  of
     violence by men to control and punish women is  perceived  as  socially
     acceptable to both men and women of all ages.106
     * Gendered constructions of male and female sexuality have created  the
     idea that men should be sexually active and women passive  and  without
     sexual desire, which cultural prohibition  implies  to  some  men  that
     women need to be forced to have sex  in  a  context  where  it  is  not
     acceptable for women to indicate her  consent.   It  is  this  cultural
     belief, which leads to the dangerous practice of dry sex,  where  women
     go to great lengths to avoid the natural vaginal lubrication of  sexual
     arousal (believed to be a sign of promiscuity), a  practice  that  pose
     serious risks for women's health by increasing  her  susceptibility  to
     STD's and HIV/AIDS.
     * Research has shown a vast discrepancy in attitudes  to  the  fidelity
     required from men and women:  where it is acceptable for a man to  have
     many sexual partners, a  woman  is  required  to  be  faithful  to  one
     partner.  This practice obviously  as  dire  consequences  for  women's
     health.
     *
     The intersection of race and gender oppression:
     * Examples of the double burden of oppression borne by black women  are
     slavery and indentured servitude.  Women slaves and their  bodies  were
     considered the property of their owners, and in 180 years of slavery in
     the Cape not one man was convicted of raping a woman slave.
     * The discriminatory construction of sexuality for men  and  women  has
     been compounded on a racial level in South Africa, where black  women's
     bodies have been violated throughout its history.  Where perpetrator of
     violence against a black woman was a white man,  his  acts  were  often
     ignored, while black men who assaulted or raped white women were  often
     given the death penalty.107
     * Militarisation:
     * The apartheid era militarisation of  South  Africa  and  the  use  of
     violent repression  together  with  anti-apartheid  movement  decisions
     about education and armed reaction have resulted in entire  generations
     of "lost" and violent young men and a general  culture  of  violence  -
     where violence is seen as a legitimate means of conflict resolution.
     * In addition, a culture was cultivated in which qualities regarded  as
     "feminine"  is  treated  with  contempt  as  "weakness"  and  a  tough,
     aggressive, brutal  and  competitive  masculinity  is  promoted.   This
     culture,  combined  with  the  general  psychological  consequences  of
     violence and war, has had a destructive effect on  the  lives  of  many
     South African men.
     *  Professor  Jacklyn  Cock108   similarly   blamed   the   legacy   of
     militarisation, which involves "a proliferation of weaponry  and  ideas
     which link violence to masculinity.  This militarised masculinity  puts
     women and children at risk.  This risk is amplified  in  situations  of
     poverty, unemployment and inequality were the human needs for  identity
     and security are not met.  These two factors combine to make women  and
     children the shock absorbers of violence and frustration."109
     * Changes in the social order
     * Research has shown that an increase in violence  against  women,  and
     especially sexual violence, often occurs in response to changes in  the
     social order.  Very obvious examples hereof can  be  found  in  the  Ma
     Rashea gans formed by  Basotho  men  after  the  Second  World  War  to
     "control" and punish women who were becoming increasingly  independent,
     as a result of, inter alia, migration by men to South Africa in  search
     of work, and in "jackrolling", a practice prevalent in the  late  1980s
     whereby young men too old to return to school and unable to  find  jobs
     abducted and raped schoolgirls in the hope  of  impregnating  them  and
     ending their education.
     * Violence against women is often also intended to communicate messages
     of victory over other men, which manifests itself in the phenomenon  of
     raping women in the presence  of  men  perceived  to  be  the  rapists'
     enemies.
     * Rape is also used as a means of punishing sexually active women,  and
     girls suspected of or known to have other partners are sometimes  gang-
     raped by their male partner's acquaintances as a form of punishment.110
     *  Legitimising  violence  against  women:   Vetten  points   out   the
     difficulties created by African  traditional  and  customary  law,  and
     mentions, by way of example, the following customs oppressive to women:
     * the levirate:  the continuation of the  deceased  husband's  marriage
     through a brother or other male relative;
     * the sororate:  requiring the younger sister of an  apparently  barren
     wife to take her place and produce children on her behalf;
     * polygamy:  taking more than one wife;
     * child betrothal and forced marriages;
     * inheritance laws, by which the family's property and wealth is passed
     down from father to son, which may leave women destitute on  the  death
     of their husbands;
     * women's minor status;
     * lobola (or bohali or bogadi):  the practice of consolidating marriage
     through the exchange of women and cattle (or cash) by the father of the
     bride and the prospective husband.
     o Nisaa made the submission that government inaction is a factor, which
     contributes to the high level of gender violence in societies.  Despite
     the legal system's role as  an  institution  for  censure  of  socially
     unacceptable acts, it  often  appears  to  tolerate  acts  of  violence
     against women, particularly so when the violence occurs  in  the  home.
     The failure of the  legal  system  to  prosecute  alleged  rapists  and
     batterers and to  secure  convictions  with  hefty  sentences  sends  a
     powerful message to men that their violence is  acceptable,  and  women
     internalise the message that their lives and safety are not  worthy  of
     protection.  The law also does not name violence against women, and  it
     has been left to the women's movement to coin terms such  as  "domestic
     violence",  "sexual  harassment",  "date  rape",  "femicide",   "forced
     prostitution",  "sex-selective  abortions"  and  "genital  mutilation".
     Many abuses women suffer have remained invisible  in  mainstream  legal
     culture.
     o Submissions also complained that, despite its wide-ranging powers  to
     educate the public, the media was irresponsible  in  its  reporting  of
     violence  against  women,  perpetuating  stereotypes  and  relying   on
     sensationalism.  The Commission  on  Gender  Equality  (CGE)  made  the
     following submissions in this regard to the Committee:
     * Reporting on rape is characterised by sensationalism in reporting  on
     extreme and sadistic violence; stereotypes about the myth of rape by  a
     deranged stranger (while in reality the rapist is much more  likely  to
     be the  man  next  door)111,  and  the  "blameworthiness"  of  sexually
     experienced  victims;  media  reports  differ  substantially  when  the
     accused exhibits other criminal behaviour (like being  a  gang  member)
     than when the accused is businessman or a sport celebrity (such  as  in
     the case of Makhaya Ntini);  CGE is concerned that the recent voluntary
     disclosure of the identities of rape victims may lead to the  violation
     of the survivor's right to privacy where she does not choose to do so.
     * The reporting of femicide is often done in a manner,  which  obscures
     the nature of the crime, such as "Woman dies after row"  or  "Policeman
     among 3 killed as lovers' tiff ends in tragedy."
     * Domestic violence has received very little attention from the  media,
     and tends only to do so in the cases of celebrities. The nuclear family
     is often depicted as the norm in  South  Africa's  media,  despite  the
     reality that more South  Africans  belong  to  extended  family  units,
     blended households or female-only households.
     * The attitudes of radio presenters can serve to reinforce  prejudices,
     especially in a country where illiteracy levels are so  high  and  more
     people have access to radio than to television.
     * The importance of regulatory bodies such as the IBA,  ASA  and  Press
     Ombudsman was emphasised, as well as the need for clear guidelines  and
     disciplinary procedures.
     o  The  destructive  potential  of  inaccurate  media   reporting   was
     illustrated in the reporting of  the  Committee's  attempts  to  engage
     members of the  judiciary  in  constructive  discussions  about  issues
     relating to violence against women.  Such attempts  were  irresponsibly
     and inaccurately portrayed as a "summons" by  the  Committee  to  Judge
     John  Foxcroft,  thereby  creating  imaginary  conflict   between   the
     Committee and the judiciary.112
     o The Commission for Gender Equality also mentioned that the media  has
     played an important role in putting issues such as rape on the national
     agenda.
     o Both government submissions and those of NGO's reported  an  enormous
     lack of understanding of violence against women by  the  public.   Both
     men and women are ignorant of women's rights to be  free  of  violence,
     especially domestic violence.  For example, many men and women still do
     not recognise marital rape as a crime.
     o It was also apparent from the submissions that both men and women are
     uninformed about sex and sexual health, and women are therefore  unable
     to act to protect themselves, and to provide information and support to
     other young women.113
     o Various submissions stressed  the  importance  of  involving  men  in
     programmes on eradicating violence against  women.   It  was  suggested
     that all people involved in men's programmes should attend  a  national
     forum  to  discuss  violence  against  women.   Men  must   develop   a
     partnership with women's groups in addressing the  problems  which  men
     and women face;  it is necessary to acknowledge  that  men  too  suffer
     from the traumas of the past.114
     o Although they did not participate  in  the  hearings,  the  Committee
     Chair  has  addressed  shopstewards  in  the  COSATU  campaign  against
     violence against women  in  conjunction  with  their  campaign  against
     HIV/AIDS.  COSATU has  produced  a  guide  for  shopstewards  on  these
     issues, and is also in the process of holding  training  workshops  for
     its shop stewards.  The campaign encourages the shopstewards to do  the
     following:
     * Educate their members about violence against women;
     * Take up sexual harassment cases on behalf of their members;
     * Ensure that there are sexual harassment grievance procedures  in  the
     terms and conditions of employment at their workplace;
     * Develop a code of conduct on  sexual  harassment  together  with  the
     employer;
     * Talk to known abusers among their members about their abuse;
     * Assist any woman member who is being abused and ensure  that  she  is
     given time off to go to court or to move her children and belongings to
     a safe place;
     * Help abused women to negotiate a transfer  to  a  different  town  to
     escape the violence;
     * Ensure that women are able to  reach  their  transport  safely  after
     work;
     * Invite women leaders to speak at the workplace so that  workers  will
     understand and stop violence against women;
     * Ensure that the Employment Equity Act is implemented;
     * Negotiate with their employer to provide childcare.
     o The South African education  system,  which  ought  to  be  the  main
     channel of promoting awareness of gendered violence  among  the  youth,
     has been and remains in  a  state  of  transition.   Not  only  is  the
     Department of Education burdened with the  task  of  reconstructing  an
     education system ravaged by apartheid, but also our schools are staffed
     by  teachers  who  are  products  of  an  apartheid  education   system
     themselves.
     o  CEDAW  requires  government  to  "adopt  all  appropriate  measures,
     especially in the field of education, to modify the social and cultural
     patterns of conduct of men  and  women  and  to  eliminate  prejudices,
     customary practices and all other practices based on the  idea  of  the
     inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes  and  on  stereotyped
     roles for men and women."115
     o In its  Gender  Equity  Task  Team  report  (the  GETT  report),  the
     Department  of  Education  identified  the  following  issues   to   be
     considered and addressed relating  to  gender-sensitive  education  and
     violence against women:-
     * identifying means  of  correcting  gender  imbalances  in  enrolment,
     dropout rates, subject choice, career paths and performance;
     * the advantages and disadvantages single sex schools;
     * sexism in curricula, textbooks, teaching and guidance;
     * the poor representation of women in management positions;  and
     * sexism, sexual  harassment  and  violence  throughout  the  education
     system.
     o The GETT report also lists the following recommendations116:-
     * That new legislation should be developed to make explicit  the  legal
     responsibilities of education  authorities  to  uphold  the  rights  of
     students  to  be  free  from  discrimination  and   harassment.    Such
     legislation should also define gendered and sex  based  harassment  and
     should be made unlawful in all contexts in educational settings.
     * That the National Department of Education should develop  an  interim
     policy on sex and gender based harassment and violence.
     * That the National Department of Education should develop  a  training
     package for educational managers on  their  responsibility  to  prevent
     discrimination, violence and harassment, as well as curriculum packages
     which incorporate learning about gender and violence at all  levels  of
     education.
     o The Department of Education participated  in  the  hearings  and  the
     Minister of Education delivered an oral  submission  to  the  Committee
     regarding the Minister and the Department's efforts to address violence
     against women.
     o The Department  of  Education's  1997  report  on  Gender  Equity  in
     Education dealt with sex based violence in schools,  and  states  inter
     alia that "the sheer dimension of sex  or  gender  based  violence  and
     harassment in education in SA subverts the right of  women  and  girls,
     and many boys, to participate in education on the same  basis  as  most
     men and boys."
     o The Director-General of Education reported to the Committee that,  in
     their attempts to include sex and gender education in  the  curriculum,
     they had initially experienced some resistance  from  sections  of  the
     communities who did not want to expose  small  children  to  issues  of
     sexuality. This problem had abated somewhat, and it was hoped that  the
     issue could be more  appropriately  addressed  under  the  auspices  of
     Curriculum 2005.
     o The Minister of Education reported to the  Committee  that  a  Gender
     Equity Directorate had been established in  April  1999,  which  liases
     with  Gender  Focal  Persons  in  Provincial  Departments  through  the
     National Gender Coordination Committee.  An Interim Gender Coordinating
     Committee from the four  branches  of  the  Department  had  also  been
     established.
     o The  Department  of  Education  was  also  preparing  gender-training
     programmes for all officials, both national and provincial, as well  as
     a Mainstreaming Handbook for use by gender officers.
     o A  school-based  project  on  sex-based  &  gender-based  violence  &
     harassment (McGill University in Canada) was  being  developed,  and  a
     successful  and well-attended seminar on sexual harassment  in  schools
     was held in May 1999.
     o The Committee would like  to  receive  a  formal  response  from  the
     Department of Education on the following issues117:-
     * the Department's  efforts  to  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  not
     isolated to the Gender Equity Unit;
     * what programmes the Department is planning to raise awareness in both
     educational institutions and the general public to raise  awareness  of
     sexism and violence against women, and in  particular  the  pre-service
     and in-service training of teachers regarding these issues;
     * the provision of extended day care facilities  for  younger  children
     and the infants born to school girls;
     * the Department's investigation into the desirability  of  single  sex
     government schools and the possibility  of  teaching  certain  subjects
     separately to boys and girls;
     * the development of gender sensitive textbooks  and  curricula,118  as
     well as the development of comprehensive age-sensitive sex  and  sexual
     health education;
     * the Department's efforts to improve the  education  and  Matric  pass
     rates and to decrease the  dropout  rate  of  girls,  especially  rural
     African and coloured girls.
     * THE BUDGET AND ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES
     o CEDAW stipulates  that  government  should  include  in  its  budgets
     adequate resources for its activities relating to  the  elimination  of
     violence against women.119
     o At a cabinet meeting in 1996, the  Department  of  Finance  committed
     itself to considering  the  reallocation  of  military  expenditure  to
     support women's economic advancement.   In  1992/1993,  the  Department
     reduced expenditure on Defence from 9,1 % of total government  spending
     to 5,7% in 1997/1998.  Spending on social services increased from 43,8%
     in 1992/1993 to 46,9% in 1997/1998.120
     o In its  Second  Annual  Report  (January  1998  -  March  1999),  the
     Committee recorded its formal questions to the Minister of Finance  on,
     inter alia, progress on  the  Ministry's  1996  Cabinet  commitment  to
     reduce military expenditure and to utilise the savings towards  women's
     empowerment.  The report further records that,  in  a  briefing  on  16
     March 1998, the Minister indicated that military spending had decreased
     from 4,5% of GDP in 1993-1994 to 1,5% in 1999-2000, and that  the  main
     beneficiaries of this decrease had  been  the  Departments  of  Health,
     Education and Welfare.121
     o Yet in the 1999 Medium Term  Budget  Policy  Statement,  the  average
     annual growth in present and  projected  proportional  expenditure  for
     Defence and Intelligence was 14,9%, more than double the figure for any
     of  the  other  services,  including  Education,  Health  and  Welfare.
     "Strong growth in protection services  over  the  medium  term  largely
     reflects additional defence spending of R2,8  billion  in  2000/01  and
     R3,8 billion in 2001/02 on the strategic procurement package."
     o The Department of Finance was invited by the Committee to  present  a
     submission at the hearings.   Although  Deputy  Minister  attended  the
     hearings, he advised the Committee that the  Department  had  not  been
     able to prepare a submission to the Committee.  To date, the  Committee
     also has not received a response to questions posed to Deputy  Minister
     at the hearings.
     o The Committee requires an urgent  response  from  the  Department  of
     Finance on, amongst others:-
     * the  Department's  efforts  to  redress  the  unemployment  of  women
     formerly employed in the clothing and textile industries caused by  the
     liberalisation of trade policy as a means of  increasing  international
     competitiveness in the manufacturing sector
     o Various projects in the NCPS Victim Empowerment Programme (VEP)  were
     intended to focus on issues relating  to  violence  against  women  and
     children.  As will appear  below,  very  few  of  these  projects  have
     sustainable funding, and many of the projects  were  only  intended  to
     operate for one year:-
     * "Multi-disciplinary Management of Child Abuse  and  Neglect":   Donor
     funding of R2 million paid for the 1998/1999 year of operation; for the
     1999-2001 years, "alternate sources of funding" would be sought  during
     1998.122
     * "Primary Health Care Model  to  Reduce  the  Risk  of  Inter-personal
     Violence":  This was only intended to be  a  one-year  project,  to  be
     implemented during 1998/1999, with funding of R400 000 sourced from the
     VEP.123
     *  "Violence  Referral  Centres"  -  a  pilot  programme  to  establish
     "Violence Referral Management  centres  in  four  provinces,  receiving
     referrals from frontline  staff":   This  project  was  similarly  only
     intended to be a one-year project, to be implemented  during  1998/1999
     at a cost of R510 000, funded by the VEP.124
     * "Outreach Centres to Counter-act Domestic  Violence"  -  a  programme
     designed to give support for the establishment of outreach  centres  in
     provinces to expand services to victims of  domestic  violence:   Donor
     funding of R1,2 million paid for the implementation of this project  in
     Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape, whilst the VEP paid R1,2  million  for
     its implementation in North-West Province and the Free State.  The  VEP
     would pay R3 million for  its  implementation  in  the  remaining  five
     provinces in 2000/2001.  "Alternate funding"  would  be  sought  during
     1998 for the continued operation of these programmes.125
     * R65 000 was budgeted from the VEP for "Access to Legal Provisions  to
     Counter-act Domestic Violence in Rural  Communities",  a  project  only
     intended to be operational during 1998/1999.126
     * "Violence Prevention  in  Schools",  a  project  implemented  by  the
     Department of Health (in conjunction with the  US  Centre  for  Disease
     Control) for the 1998/1999 year at a cost of R65  000,  funded  by  the
     VEP.127
     * "National Policy Guidelines  on  Victims  of  Sexual  Offences"  -  a
     project  encompassing  nine  provincial  workshops  to  train   service
     providers on the basis of the  national  policy  guidelines  on  sexual
     offences:  this project was funded by the VEP at a  cost  of  R150  000
     during 1998/1999.128
     * "Victim Empowerment in  Schools  -  Life  Skills  Curriculum":   this
     project was funded by the VEP at a cost of R150 000, and intended to be
     a one-year project during 1998/1999.129
     * The VEP paid for a training course for the SAPS entitled "Victims  of
     Violence:   Domestic  Violence  and  Sexual  Offences   Case   Handling
     Training" at a cost of R100 000 for 1998/1999;  funding  for  1999/2000
     and 2000/2001 "to be secured in order to extend to these two years".130
     * An information and public awareness project hosted by the  Department
     of Welfare, funded until 2001 by the VEP.131
     o In its  Second  Annual  Report  (January  1998  -  March  1999),  the
     Committee reported that no specific budgetary allocations had been made
     for violence against  women,  unlike  other  crimes  declared  priority
     crimes in terms of the NCPS, such as hijacking.  Similarly, departments
     such as Safety and Security did not have specific,  separate  budgetary
     allocations for violence against women.
     o The exclusion of victims of  domestic  violence  from  the  Fund  for
     Victims of Violent Crime Bill132.
     o The Commission for Gender Equality also raised the issue of involving
     the private sector in programmes addressing violence against women.  An
     example of such involvement, which is  accessible  and  effective,  the
     private sector could assist in establishing shelters  and  safe  houses
     for victims of violence.
     o Various submissions133 to the Committee mentioned that  the  cost  of
     violence  against  women  in  South  Africa,  and  especially  domestic
     violence, has never been calculated due to ineffective documentation of
     these incidents by the health and criminal justice sectors.   Yet  even
     with loose indicators of the frequency and extent of  violence  against
     women, it is apparent that it has a staggering economic impact  on  our
     health,  welfare,  policing  and  justice  resources.   A  1994   study
     undertaken by the Health Maintenance Organisation found that women  who
     have been raped or beaten had medical costs two and a half times higher
     than those who were not victimised.
     o By way of example,  CERSA  reported  that  the  number  of  treatment
     episodes in one year as a result of abuse by partner or ex-partner  was
     121 000 in the Eastern Cape, 74 294 in Mpumalanga and  93  868  in  the
     Northern Province.134
     o These costs are both public and private, paid for by women and  their
     families (medical care, accommodation,  travel,  direct  income,  child
     care, serious injury, loss of property and non-monetary costs).  Health
     costs carried by the state include doctors,  nurses,  emergency  wards,
     clinics, mental health services,  justice costs include police,  courts
     and correctional services;  in the  social  services  sector,  welfare,
     housing and child care.  Employers also pay for violence against  women
     in the form of high absenteeism and lower productivity.
     o Calculating the real economic costs may be hampered by the fact  that
     violence against women is under-reported, prenatal damage caused by the
     abuse  of  pregnant  women  if   difficult   to   quantify,   long-term
     consequences such as intergenerational transfers of violence  behaviour
     cannot be accurately estimated and private costs  to  women  cannot  be
     captured.135
     * INTER-MINISTERIAL CO-OPERATION AND CO-OPERATIVE GOVERNANCE
     o The National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS), adopted by the Cabinet
     in May 1996, is the government's flagship inter-departmental  programme
     in its efforts to combat  crime.   One  of  the  NCPS  programme  which
     affects issues of violence against  women  is  the  Victim  Empowerment
     Programme,  hosted  by  the  core  NCPS  departments,  namely  Justice,
     Welfare, the SAPS, Safety & Security  and  Correctional  Services,  but
     also involves the departments of Health and Education,  and  provincial
     departments.136
     o R1,5 million of the OSW's funding of R2,5 million for  1998/1999  was
     donor funding,  which  terminated  in  August  1999.   The  budget  for
     1999/2000 only covers salaries and administration.137
     o During 1999, the OSW advised the Committee that it was  developing  a
     green paper on a national gender policy to  be  passed  by  Cabinet  in
     1998.  This policy document was not finalised by the OSW  during  1998.
     On 15 March 1999, Deputy Minister Essop Pahad and the director  of  the
     OSW, Dr Ellen Kornegay, advised the Committee  that  a  draft  national
     gender document had been completed and was undergoing internal  review,
     to be realised as a green paper.
     o On 15 March 1999, the OSW also advised  the  Committee  that  it  was
     conducting a gender  audit  on  internal  transformation  and  external
     service delivery of all government departments and all  the  provinces,
     with a view to developing a national action plan.
     o The Committee requires a  response  from  the  Department  of  Health
     regarding the  procedures  in  place  to  ensure  that  under-resourced
     provinces  and  local  governments   receive   more   money   for   the
     implementation of both primary health care, as well as free health care
     for pregnant women and children under the age  of  six,  than  stronger
     resourced provinces and local governments.138
     o Although the Department of Foreign Affairs were not requested by  the
     Committee to participate in the November 1999 hearings,  the  Committee
     would like to know whether and when a gender desk will  be  established
     in the Department.  The Committee also requires  information  regarding
     the Department's efforts to set  up  international  links  relating  to
     international trafficking in women and prostitution.
     o In view of various submissions relating to  women's  difficulties  in
     escaping situations of especially domestic violence due to no access to
     alternative housing, the Committee also requires a  response  from  the
     Departments of Housing and Agriculture and Land Affairs (both  of  whom
     were also not requested  to  participate  in  the  hearings)  on  their
     efforts to ensure that women  are  not  discriminated  against  in  the
     granting of housing subsidies, access to rural housing and  rural  land
     allocation.  The Committee is particularly interested in  the  progress
     and achievements of the Women for Housing Group in  the  Department  of
     Housing with reference to their  April  1998  draft  document  entitled
     "Guiding  Principles  and  Practices  Relating   to   Women's   Housing
     Issues".139
     * CO-OPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY
     o CEDAW requires government to recognise the importance  of  NGO's,  to
     facilitate and enhance their work and to co-operate with  them  on  all
     levels.140
     o Numerous submissions mentioned the importance  of  an  inter-sectoral
     approach, involving both government and civil  society,  in  addressing
     violence against women.
     o It appears that the National Network on Violence  Against  Women  has
     been most successful in bringing together government and civil  society
     on issues relating  to  violence  against  women.   The  Department  of
     Welfare has formed a partnership with the National Network on  Violence
     Against Women since inception of  the  Network,  and  the  Network  has
     received financial and administrative support from  the  Department.141
     The Department of Health also participates in the National  Network  on
     Violence Against Women.142
     o The Committee was also told of the involvement of organisations  like
     People Opposed to Women  Abuse  in  programmes  of  the  Department  of
     Correctional Services.
     o At the same time, many of the NGO's mentioned their prime  difficulty
     of lack of funding, and that most of their  time  was  spent  on  fund-
     raising instead of addressing their substantive goals.
     * THE NEED FOR A STATISTICAL DATABASE
     o CEDAW stipulates that the state  should  "promote  research,  collect
     data and compile statistics, especially concerning  domestic  violence,
     relating to the prevalence of different forms of violence against women
     and  encourage  research  on  the  causes,  nature,   seriousness   and
     consequences of violence against women  and  on  the  effectiveness  of
     measures implemented to prevent and  redress  violence  against  women;
     those statistics and findings of the research will be made public"143
     o In South Africa, there has been a  notable  lack  of  community-based
     data and reliable statistics on violence against  women  and  children,
     its prevalence and epidemiological studies of risk  factors.   Most  of
     the research undertaken on violence against women in South  Africa  has
     been relatively small scale, localised or has focused on particular sub-
     groups, e.g. health service users.144
     o By way of example, Masimanyane reported that their  research  on  the
     prosecution of sexual offences  cases  were  made  extremely  difficult
     through  the  absence  of  any  recordal  system  whatsoever  by  court
     officials, and police dockets and court files  which  were  incomplete.
     Nisaa also reported that there is no official methodology which records
     how many women phone police stations when they are in a crisis or  when
     their lives are endangered.  When women report abuse, domestic violence
     is recorded as common assault or assault with the intent to do grievous
     bodily harm.  This difficulty creates a further obstacle  in  cases  of
     femicide, where a long history of abuse is commonly found.
     o Nisaa further reported  that  the  disaggregation  of  data  and  the
     devising of protocols around domestic violence may  yield  better  data
     collection, and that the Department of  Safety  and  Security  is  best
     positioned to do this.
     o In its 1998 White Paper, the Department of Safety and Security stated
     that it  aims  to  improve  the  reliability  of  crime  statistics  in
     general145.  The Committee will request the Department  to  furnish  it
     with a progress report in this regard.
     * RECOMMENDATIONS AND QUERIES TO GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
     o Criminal justice
     The Committee recommends:
     * that the availability of and access to legal aid  to  women  who  are
     victims of violence be given urgent  consideration  by  the  Legal  Aid
     Board and the Department of Justice;146
     *  that  urgent  attention  be  given  to  the  appointment   of   more
     prosecutors, intermediaries, interpreters and magistrates147, and  that
     the Department of Justice allocate resources for this purpose;
     *  that  the  training  of  magistrates  and  prosecutors  in   gender-
     sensitivity, issues  relating  to  gender  violence  and  dealing  with
     traumatised witnesses, especially children, be given priority;148
     * that clerks of the  court,  who  will  be  the  point  of  entry  for
     complainants in terms of  the  new  Domestic  Violence  Act,  be  given
     mandatory training in gender sensitivity and the effects and nature  of
     domestic violence;149
     * that consideration be given to a more  accessible  court  system  for
     women in rural areas;150
     * that the establishment of  more  Sexual  Offence  and  Family  Courts
     receive priority;
     * that rape and sexual  offence  cases  and  cases  of  crimes  against
     children be dealt with on a separate and continuous roll  by  both  the
     High Court and Magistrate's Courts;151
     * that attention  be  given  by  the  Judicial  Service  Commission  to
     sensitivity  to  gender  issues  in  the  appointment  of  High   Court
     judges152, and that judges receive training in  the  international  law
     requirements  of   CEDAW   and   other   international   human   rights
     instruments153, the  nature  and  effect  of  violence  against  women,
     dealing with traumatised victims and gender sensitivity in  general154;
     and
     * that gun control laws be enforced more strictly.155
     o Law enforcement
     The Committee recommends:
     * that the Department of Safety  and  Security  allocate  resources  to
     engage the services of experienced trainers  from  reputable  NGO's  to
     train members of the police in:
     * the devastating effect of violence against women, including  domestic
     violence, which is often treated by police officers as "unimportant";
     * sensitive treatment of traumatised survivors of rape, sexual  assault
     and violence against women in general;156
     * the various legal remedies available to survivors  of  violence.   It
     appeared from various submissions that complainants often relied on the
     police for advice on her choice of  remedy.   In  some  cases,  it  was
     reported that police try to dissuade women from laying charges  against
     perpetrators by stressing  negative  consequences  for  women  if  they
     insist on the arrest of the offender.157
     * accurate and adequate forensic  investigations  for  the  purpose  of
     criminal prosecution.158
     * that  more  female  police  officers  be  made  available  to  assist
     survivors of violence159;
     * that the Department of Safety  and  Security  allocate  resources  to
     establish a proper surveillance and data collection system which  would
     make it possible, inter alia,  to  identify  specific  locations  where
     attacks on women regularly occur and to identify reasons for  the  non-
     prosecution of violence against women;160
     * that more police stations  be  established  and  equipped,  including
     satellite police stations, especially in the rural and poorer areas;161
     * that urgent attention be given to more visible street policing162 and
     street lighting.163
     o Welfare services and shelters
     The Committee recommends:
     * that the Department of Welfare embarks on extensive training  of  its
     officials to equip them to deal  with  survivors  of  violence  against
     women164;
     * that both government and civil society give urgent attention  to  the
     establishment of shelters for abused women.  This is also a project  in
     which the private  sector  can  make  a  specific  and  greatly  needed
     contribution towards assisting women to  remove  themselves  and  their
     children from situations of violence.165
     o Health care
     The Committee recommends:
     * the incorporation of treatment of the survivors  of  sexual  violence
     and other violence against women in the curriculum for the training  of
     doctors, nurses and other health workers.   Such  treatment  must  also
     incorporate  an  understanding  of  the  trauma  experienced   by   the
     survivor;166
     * that urgent attention be given to the availability  of  treatment  of
     rape survivors of STD's and other health risks, and that the Department
     of Health prioritises establishing the effectiveness of anti-retroviral
     drugs like AZT for rape survivors;
     * that urgent attention be given to  women's  access  to  health  care,
     especially rural women;
     * that priority be given to the expansion of the existing  project  for
     the training of forensic nurses;  and
     * that the removal of question 11(e) from Form J88 be considered.
     o Incarceration of offenders
     The Committee recommends that:-
     *  the  Department   investigates   the   implementation   of   weekend
     incarceration, especially of perpetrators of domestic violence;167
     * a fund be created to which victims or relatives  can  apply  to  fund
     expenses related to attending parole hearings;168
     * a  fund  be  created  to  assist  prisoners  who  become  victims  of
     violence.169
     o Public awareness and education
     The Committee recommends:
     * an extensive public awareness campaign in all languages  through  the
     use of electronic and print media about the right of women to  be  free
     of violence.  Such campaign must address both women and men,  and  must
     also target rural areas in an accessible way.  It  is  also  imperative
     that community organisations, especially religious  organisations,  are
     involved in the campaign on an  on-going  basis  and  that  influential
     people in the  community  (including  politicians,  religious  leaders,
     business leaders and youth organisations) on national,  provincial  and
     local level, make public statements in support of the campaign170;
     * that the Department of Justice drives  a  public  education  campaign
     focussing on legal remedies available  to  women  who  are  victims  of
     violence, and in particular the provisions  of  the  Domestic  Violence
     Act;171
     * proper education on sex, sexual health, the crime of violence against
     women  and  alternative  conflict  resolution  mechanisms  (other  than
     violence) -
     * as part of the school curriculum, taught at an age-appropriate  level
     from an early age.  Such programmes must also focus on the  development
     of self-reliance and self-esteem for both girls and boys.172  Attention
     also need to be given to teacher-training to ensure that teachers  feel
     qualified to deliver such education173;
     * for parents by way of national workshops and  seminars  on  parenting
     skills174;  and
     * for men through employee's  organisations  and  unions.175   Changing
     men's perceptions should receive high priority as a  mainstream  issue,
     and provision should be made for both primary  prevention  as  well  as
     secondary prevention, such as counselling  programmes  for  abusers;176
     and
     * in communities by representatives of the police,  welfare  and  legal
     services177, utilising the network of as many  community  organisations
     as possible, including women's  organisations,  specifically  to  reach
     women who have already left school and unemployed men.
     *  Such  education  should   address,   inter   alia,   the   following
     questions178:
     * What is love?  In what ways can it be demonstrated?
     * What do young people do sexually?  Why do people have sex?
     * Do men and women have equal sexual rights?
     * What kinds of relationship can young people have?
     * What alternative sexual practices are there?
     * How can men and women communicate about sexual matters?
     * Who can say no to sex, and how?  Who can ask for it?
     * Who has or is allowed to have multiple sexual partners?  And why?
     * What is sexual abuse and violence?
     * When and why does violence occur within relationships?
     * Is violence acceptable within relationships?
     * How can potentially violent situations be dealt with?
     o It appeared from numerous submissions that the lack of employment and
     realisable aspirations among especially young men  contributed  towards
     abuse of women through displacement  of  frustrations  onto  vulnerable
     partners, as well as through  increased  drug  and  alcohol  use.   The
     Committee therefore recommends that government prioritises job creation
     in areas where abuse is most prevalent.179

     The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of  Quality  of  Life
     and Status of Women's: Additions to the Report on the Violence  Against
     Women Hearings - February 2001


     The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Quality of  Life  and  Status  of
     Women held public hearings on Violence Against Women in November  1999.
     The report (of February 2000) does not include recommendations  by  the
     Committee on the issues covered below.  The  Committee  recommends  the
     following inclusions:


     13.8 The budget and allocation of resources
     The committee recommends that:
     13.8.1 Government prioritise resources, both financial  and  human,  to
     projects such  as  those  in  the  NCPS  Victim  Empowerment  Programme
     especially where it relates to violence against women and children.
     13.8.2 Separate budgetary allocations  be  made  for  violence  against
     women in departments such as Safety and Security.
     13.8.3 The Department of Finance ensures that the  gender  analysis  of
     the different department's programmes be reintroduced in  the  National
     Budget.
     13.9 Inter-ministerial co-operation and co-operative governance
     The committee recommends that:
     13.9.1 The Department of Foreign Affairs makes a written submission on:-


     13.9.1.1 The development of a gender desk in the department.
     13.9.1.2 The department's programmes and efforts, which aim to  curtail
     the international and cross-border trafficking of  women  and  children
     from South Africa and into South Africa.
     13.9.1.3 What the department's role is together with the Department  of
     Justice in considering legislation in this regard?
     13.9.2 The Departments of Housing, Agriculture and Land Affairs provide
     the Committee with a report on the progress  and  achievements  of  the
     Women For Housing Group  in  the  Department  of  Housing,  efforts  in
     ensuring that women are not discriminated against in  the  granting  of
     housing subsidies, access to rural housing and rural land allocation.
     13.10 Co-operation between government and civil society
     13.10.1  Government  departments  to  issue  progress  reports  to  the
     Committee on their involvement  with  NGO's  and  in  particular,  what
     funding has been provided to the NGO sector in giving effect to CEDAW.
     13.11 The need for a statistical database
     13.11.1 The Department of Safety and Security should be asked to ensure
     that their information on violence against women be disaggregated in  a
     more effective manner, which clearly  indicates  and  records  data  on
     domestic violence and femicide.


     The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement  of  the  Quality  of
     Life and Status of Women


     Summary Report On Violence Against Women


     JULY 2001


     Introduction


     The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement  of  the  Quality  of
     Life and Status of Women (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) was
     permanently established in June 1998 to monitor  and  oversee  progress
     with regard to the improvement of the quality of  life  and  status  of
     women in South Africa.  The Committee's specific brief  is  to  monitor
     government's commitments  made  at  the  United  Nations  Fourth  World
     Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 and the provisions of the United
     Nations Convention on the Elimination of all  Forms  of  Discrimination
     against Women (CEDAW).


     The South African government signed and ratified CEDAW  and  government
     departments tabled their commitments to the Beijing Platform for Action
     (BPFA) in February 1996.  Both CEDAW and  the  BPFA  detail  a  state's
     obligation to introduce measures to protect the  rights  of  women  and
     mechanisms to eliminate gender-based violence.


     The Committee's hearings on violence against women were held  from  8th
     to  17th  November  1999.   Copies  off  all  written  submissions  are
     available from the Committee clerk.  The  objectives  of  the  hearings
     were the following: -
     * To identify what and where the blockages are which impede  women  who
     have been victims of all forms of violence, from access to justice; and
     * To determine the varied ways in which such obstacles to  justice  can
     be addressed and eliminated.


     This summary report will detail the following:
     * An overview of the critical points raised in the submissions  at  the
     hearings, November 1999.
     * To track the changes after the November 1999 hearings within  various
     sectors dealing with aspects of violence against women.


     An Overview - Violence against Women Hearings, November 1999


     The detailed report discussed  violence  against  women,  with  special
     reference to the submissions made at the hearings, under the headings:
     * Criminal Justice
     * Law Enforcement
     * Welfare Services and Shelter
     * Health Care
     * Incarceration of Offenders
     * Recent Research on Violence against Women
     * Public Awareness and Education
     * Allocation of Financial Resources and the Budget
     * Inter-Ministerial Co-Operative Governance
     * Co-Operation between Government and Civil Society
     * The Need for a Statistical Database
     * Recommendations and Queries to Government Departments


     A comprehensive assessment and analysis of  the  above  is  beyond  the
     scope of this summary report.  The detailed report is attached to  this
     summary report so that readers can use it as a cross- reference if more
     information is required around certain aspects.


     Achievements of South Africa  in  Working  Toward  the  Elimination  of
     Violence against Women


     Criminal Justice
     New and Proposed Legislation and its Implementation
     New Legislation
     * The Domestic Violence Act (DVA) (Act No. 116 of 1998) which  repeales
     some sections of the Prevention of Family Violence Act (Act No. 133  of
     1993).
     * The Criminal Procedure Act, which limits the  granting  of  bail  for
     persons accused of committing serious offences, which include rape  and
     which also makes provision for minimum sentences for  murder  and  rape
     with aggravating circumstances.


     Proposed Legislation
     The South African Law Commission's (SALC)  Sexual  Offences  Discussion
     Paper incorporates a proposed Sexual Offences Bill  which  extends  the
     common law definition of rape to include 'unlawful sexual  penetration'
     under coercive circumstances.  The proposed legislation  provides  that
     marriage do not constitute a defence to rape.  Also, consent  does  not
     constitute a defence in:
     o Sexual molestation.
     o Sexual offences against mentally impaired persons.
     o Child prostitution.


     The move away from 'without consent'  to  'coercive  circumstances'  is
     considered by many as progressive.


     SALC has also produced a discussion paper on procedural aspects of  the
     prosecution of sexual offences,  which  include  the  cautionary  rule,
     evidence of previous sexual reconciliation history of complainant.




     Specific Impediments to the Implementation of the Domestic Violence Act
     (DVA) and Issues Pertaining to Sexual Offences - Submissions180


     The following crucial  points  were  raised  at  the  Hearings  of  the
     Committee, in written and oral form.  It must be pointed out  that  the
     hearings were held before the implementation of the DVA (December 1999)
     and that these submissions highlight the perceived problems that  could
     be encountered.  These were:
     * Women's inability to access their rights due  to  lack  of  knowledge
     around the DVA.
     * Discretion of magistrates in sentencing procedures.
     * Legal representation is too costly and  so  disadvantages  many  poor
     women.
     * Education for the judiciary, for example,  clerks  of  the  court  is
     inadequate.
     * Inaccessibility to  police  stations  and  courts  due  to  transport
     problems make it difficult for women to report and follow-up  and  thus
     recourse to the DVA would not fully be utilised.
     * Whilst  the  legal  aspects  of  the  DVA  are  technically  correct,
     activists argue that support mechanisms to ensure  the  eradication  of
     domestic violence is lacking.
     * Misconception around domestic violence even amongst victims as it  is
     still viewed as a "private family matter".
     * Language barriers and staff shortages  further  exacerbate  the  full
     implementation of the DVA.
     * Confusion around whether social workers  or  police  officers  inform
     victims of their rights.
     * The 13 forms required to implement the DVA were still not printed.
     * Producing proof  for  exemption  to  pay  for  protection  orders  is
     cumbersome.
     * Infrastructure to break the cycle of violence is lacking.
     * Department of Justice: consulting all role players is time consuming;
     lack of policy statements and implementation strategy  will  delay  the
     implementation of the DVA, increase  in  workload  may  result  in  bad
     service delivery and will have detrimental effects on gender  violence.
     Infrastructure, support structures and security is still lacking.
     * Functioning of Existing Courts and Establishment of Special Courts:
     o  Negative  experiences  of  courts  in  general  which  is  a  direct
     consequence of a lack of adequate facilities  and  human  resources  to
     handle victims of gender violence,  massive  backlogs  of  cases  which
     causes delays of 9 months between date of complaint and trial.
     o Communication breakdown.
     o Inadequate transport to hospitals, courts and police stations.
     o Reluctance of medical examiners to appear in court.
     o Victims waiting in the same hallways as assailants.
     o Dockets being lost.
     o Victims not notified of assailant's bail hearing.
     o Failure of Sheriffs to serve interdicts in informal and rural areas.
     o Two permanent magistrates in the Sexual  Offences  Court  raised  the
     following concerns:
     * A reconsideration of the adversarial system in sexual offences cases.
     * A re-examination of strict  rules  of  evidence  in  sexual  offences
     cases, and cautionary rules.
     * Children should testify through an intermediary.
     * Section 170A should be amended to include mentally  impaired  persons
     under 18 years.
     * 'Undue mental stress' is difficult to determine.
     * Section 51(3) of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Amendment  Act  regarding
     minimum sentences as well as  Section  158  of  the  CPA  which  allows
     witnesses not to give evidence in  the  presence  of  the  accused,  is
     difficult to interpret.


     In response to the concerns raised above,  the  Department  of  Justice
     provided the following input for more efficient service provisions.
     * They were finalising a Customer Service Charter for court users.
     * A service delivery plan was underway.
     * A Victims Rights Charter was developed.
     * Various information campaigns for court users, including the 16  Days
     of Activism Campaign, which incorporates the issue of Violence  against
     Women, were initiated.
     * Using the information from  the  Canadian  Study  Tour  to  focus  on
     lessons learnt there, such  as  an  inter-sectoral  approach,  economic
     empowerment of women, survivor counselling and offender rehabilitation,
     and shelters and safe houses for victims.
     * Specialised Family Courts are already operating as  pilot  courts  in
     Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban,  Johannesburg  and  Lebowakgomo  and
     these handle domestic violence cases.
     * The Department plans  to  establish  20  additional  Sexual  Offences
     Courts within 2 years.


     On the 1 December 1999, the Director of  Public  Prosecutions  reported
     that a Special High Court concentrating only  on  rape  cases  will  be
     established in Mdantsane.




     *  Court Clerks, Interpreters, Prosecutors and Magistrates
     Functions of Court Clerks - organisers and facilitators of  case  rolls
     at courts are the  primary  assistants  to  applicants  for  protection
     orders in terms of the DVA.


       The concerns raised with regard to the above were:
     o Prosecutors needed to give better technical assistance and support to
     women.
     o High turnovers of prosecutors that were on leave  and/or  transferred
     to other courts impact negatively on gender violence.
     o Prosecutors  are  ill-prepared  because  of  workloads  and  lack  of
     resources.
     o No hearings for violations of interdicts.
     o Magistrates and prosecutors need training  on  non-legal  aspects  of
     rape.


     In response to the above concerns, various departments commented on how
     the process was being addressed.  The President of the  Regional  Court
     for the Western Cape  reported  a  system  of  "court  nags"  has  been
     introduced to ensure court cases run on time and to telephone witnesses
     and role-players two weeks prior to trail  dates.   The  Department  of
     Justice reported that they are in the process of establishing pre-trial
     services to alert prosecutors and magistrates of  previous  convictions
     and arrests of offenders.  The Head of Sexual  Offences  and  Community
     Affairs in the Office of the Director of Public  Prosecutions  reported
     that 60 prosecutors were undergoing training which includes:
     o Collection of evidence.
     o Presentation of DNA evidence.
     o Cross-examination skills and sensitivity in dealing with witnesses.
     o Framing of age appropriate questions.
     o Also proposed that a coalition between NGOs, police  and  prosecutors
     should  be  formed  to  provide  counsellors  and  intermediaries   for
     traumatised witnesses.


     The Chief Director of the Justice College reported that magistrates and
     prosecutors are undergoing training  in  sexual  offences,  child  law,
     domestic violence, violence  against  women,  basic  human  rights  and
     social context training.


     The Judiciary


     The Committee expressed concern about  inappropriate  sentences  handed
     down by High Court Judges and implications of statements in rape  cases
     and violence against women.   Concern  was  expressed  about  views  of
     judiciary  which  reflect   stereotypes   and   suggestion   of   women
     collaborating in crimes  against  them.   Further  concern  was  raised
     around  the  interpretation  of  recent  amendments  to  the   Criminal
     Procedure Act which  deals  with  the  imposition  of  a  minimum  life
     sentence where the victim is:
     o Under 16 years old, is raped by more  than  one  person  acting  with
     common purpose, or where grievous bodily harm is inflicted,  save  were
     "substantial and compelling circumstances" exist which would justify  a
     less severe sentence.  The judicial interpretation  of  this  exception
     has come under scrutiny by women's organisations and the media.


     The University of  the  Western  Cape's  Law  Centre's  Gender  Project
     examined disparities in recent cases  and  argued  that  judges  should
     consider  the  following  factors  in   'substantial   and   compelling
     circumstances':
     o Whether the complainant has been sexually active is irrelevant.
     o Whether the complainant and accused  are  acquainted  or  related  is
     irrelevant.
     o Whether the complainant sustained any physical injury is irrelevant.


     Appeals from the Regional Court and Sexual Offences Courts


     2 concerns were raised:
     o Increase in the setting aside of convictions  and  the  reduction  of
     sentences on appeal.
     o The Director of Public Prosecutions expressed concern  about  lenient
     sentences being handed down where minimum sentences were applicable.


     Appointments of Judges and Disciplinary Proceedings


     The Chief Justice formulated the criteria for the appointment of judges
     and it became apparent  that  there  is  no  specific  requirement  for
     knowledge on and sensitivity to issues relating to women  and  violence
     against women. The Minister of Justice reported that he was  canvassing
     the views of judiciary on new legislation on training, disciplinary and
     grievance proceedings of judges.


     Education of Judges


     Constitutional Court Judge Kate O' Reagan presented a reported  on  her
     attendance at a judicial colloquim on the application of  human  rights
     law at domestic level.  Issues raised were:
     o Countries should seek ways to ensure access of women to  the  justice
     system.
     o Lawyers, legislators, judges and citizens to recognise the importance
     of and be familiar with international and regional human rights.
     o Judicial education for all stakeholders and to  integrate  CEDAW  and
     other human rights instruments into domestic law and decision making to
     enhance the social, political and economic lives of women and children.
     o Establishment  of  an  international  judicial  education  centre  to
     "assist countries in  design,  development  and  delivery  of  judicial
     education programmes on  international  human  rights  instruments  and
     jurisprudence, as well as an international resource  centre  to  advise
     and assist all stakeholders".


     LAW ENFORCEMENT


     Previous Commitments and Recommendations


     The 1998 White Paper on Safety and Security places emphasis on  service
     delivery for women who faced secondary victimisation from the  SAPS  in
     the past.  Specific guidelines for  use  at  station  level  have  been
     devised.  The White Paper adheres closely to  the  initiatives  of  the
     Victim Empowerment Programme (VEP) under the National Crime  Prevention
     Strategy (NCPS).


     The 1998 report of the Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD) on  the
     conduct of members of the SAPS provided the following recommendations:
     * Extensive training programmes for the SAPS to gain  an  understanding
     of the context and nature of violence against women.
     * A list of organisations that deal with violence against women  should
     be placed at police stations.
     * The releasing of information to the media should be reviewed.


     Present Experience of the SAPS


     The submissions to the Committee regarding  the  SAPS  highlighted  the
     difficulties confronted by women in  accessing  police  stations.   The
     most common categories that emerged strongly in  submissions  from  the
     NGOs and the SAPS were problems of attitude and abuse  and  operational
     problems.  (For a full list of these problems, please refer to the more
     detailed report).


     The following issues still remain to be addressed by the Department  of
     Safety and Security:-
     * The development of a profile of rape survivors and perpetrators.
     * Disciplinary action against members of the SAPS  who  are  themselves
     perpetrators of violence against women.
     * The technical aptitude of investigating officers in the investigation
     of charges of violence against women; especially rape.
     * The establishment of specialised units for rape  and  other  violence
     against women and children.
     * The Department's participation in trauma centres for rape survivors.


     Welfare Services and Shelters
     Counselling and Shelters


     In the White Paper  on  Social  Welfare  of  1997,  guidelines  include
     strategies to counteract all forms of abuse and violence against women;
     support services for women who have been battered, raped  and  sexually
     abused; the training  of  police  officers,  magistrates  and  criminal
     justice personnel in the management of violence against women,  gender-
     sensitive welfare services and taking into  account  women's  needs  as
     care-givers.


     Participants in the Hearings reported the following:


     * An absence of proper counselling  for  women  who  are  survivors  of
     violence.
     * Severe lack of temporary  safe  housing  for  women  as  a  means  of
     escaping situations of violence.
     * Lack of government funding of shelters.
     *  Support  services  such  as  shelters,  financial   support,   legal
     assistance, police protection, access to housing, education,  training,
     employment opportunities,  psychological  services  were  essential  to
     assist women to transcend the cycle of violence.
     * The Institute of Criminology's Gender, Law and  Development  Project,
     UCT, presented their research findings of rural areas in  the  Southern
     Cape.  These include:
     o  Participants  reported  fear  of  retaliation,  public  humiliation,
     ostracism by family and friends and little  faith  in  the  police  and
     courts.
     o Women reported little or no support from family or the community.
     o Participants reported little or no assistance from social workers and
     local welfare agencies.


     The  Welfare  Ministry  reported  on  the  following  achievements  and
     proposed projects:-
     * A service delivery  for  police  and  other  professionals  has  been
     developed.
     * "One-stop service" shelters were being planned.
     * Training of the SAPS and the Department of Justice officials  on  the
     provisions of the DVA. The training of social  workers  and  volunteers
     would take place in January/February 2000.
     * Planning of education and awareness campaigns of the DVA.
     * The Victim Empowerment Programmes (VEP), a key programme of the inter-
     ministerial  National  Crime  Prevention  Strategy  (NCPS)   has   been
     launched.


     The following issues remain  to  be  addressed  by  the  Department  of
     Welfare:
     * The Department's efforts to ensure that women are  not  discriminated
     against with regard to welfare grants and  properly  regarded  as  main
     care providers.
     * The Department's efforts to ensure the allocation of  more  funds  to
     care dependency grants for seriously impaired children.


     Transport


     *  Various  submissions  described  the  difficulties  experienced   by
     especially rural women in accessing health care and legal services  due
     to inaccessibility of transport;
     * Though the Department of Transport was not requested by the Committee
     to participate in the hearings, the Committee  intends  requesting  the
     Department to furnish it with its  formal  response  to  the  following
     issues, with reference to its White Paper on National Transport  Policy
     of 1996.  These are:
     o The Department's efforts to make public transport more accessible and
     affordable to women, who rely on these services for access  to  justice
     and health care services.
     o The Department's efforts to improve  transport  within  villages  and
     towns, as well as transport to and from rural areas.
     o The Department's efforts to ensure the safety of women on the  public
     transport system.


     Health Care
     Medico-Legal Examinations


     Various submissions reported on practical difficulties experienced with
     the required medico-legal examination of the victims of sexual  assault
     and rape:
     *  Health  care  services  are   disproportionately   concentrated   in
     historically white and urban centres.
     * A concomitant lack of access, mainly transport, especially for  rural
     women.
     * Lengthy waiting periods between reporting the crime to the police and
     the medical examination, which not only compounds the victim's  trauma,
     but is also a deterrent to proceedings with criminal charges.
     * A lack of privacy during the medical examination and a failure on the
     part of district surgeons to explain the reasons for and nature of  the
     examination. This is often due to linguistic problems.
     * Inadequate treatment for  conditions  such  as  HIV/AIDS,  STD's  and
     pregnancy, or treatment without even the most basic of explanations  of
     the health risks faced by rape survivors.
     * The President of the Regional Court in  the  Western  Cape  told  the
     Committee that district surgeons often lack  expertise  and  equipment.
     There have also been cases where  district  surgeons  have  refused  to
     examine drunk and drugged victims.
     * Reluctance on the part of district surgeons to appear in court;
     * Suggestions that district surgeons  deliberately  completed  the  J88
     forms in an inadequate manner to avoid being called as a witness.


     Physical and Psychological Aspects of Treatment of Victims of Violence


     * It further appeared  that  few  health  care  workers  were  properly
     equipped to deal with both the physical and  psychological  aspects  of
     the treatment of women and  children  who  were  victims  of  violence,
     especially sexual violence.
     * The  Women's  Health  Project  reported  that  most  of  the  general
     practitioners surveyed by them felt inadequate in  coping  with  issues
     surrounding domestic violence.
     * District surgeons  and  hospitals  were  only  concerned  about  rape
     victims when the survivor showed physical injuries.
     * It also appeared that health workers  were  perfectly  positioned  to
     assist women who are victims of violence,  with  a  majority  of  women
     informing the health care worker who treats them  of  the  identity  of
     their abuser.
     * Many health workers, however, are not trained to deal with issues  of
     violence and an education  and  counselling  opportunity  is  therefore
     missed.
     * In the Department of Health's 1998 Progress Report to the  Committee,
     the Department stated that it had joined other countries to  discuss  a
     resolution on the prevention of violence as a public  health  priority,
     that it participates in the National Network on Violence against  Women
     and that it assisted in developing guidelines for survivors  of  sexual
     offences.


     The following issues remain  to  be  addressed  by  the  Department  of
     Health:
     * The necessity of shifting the focus of health care services for women
     from childbearing to reproductive  health,  including  counselling  and
     education  on  and  treatment  for  reproductive   health,   especially
     infertility, sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  especially  violence
     against women.
     * Training and education of health care workers in domestic violence as
     a mainstream health issue.


     HIV/AIDS  and Violence against Women


     * Women and children who have been the  victims  of  sexual  abuse  and
     violence  face  special  risks  of  contracting  sexually   transmitted
     diseases (STDs) and in particular HIV/AIDS.
     * The violence and coercion involved in the sexual relationships of  so
     many men and women in  South  Africa  limit  especially  young  women's
     capacities to protect themselves against HIV/AIDS.
     * Various perverse myths have arisen during the last decade  connecting
     sex with certain types of women with a cure for AIDS, thereby adding  a
     new dimension to sexual violence against women.
     * Government funding of the controversial drug AZT.  In an  address  to
     the National Assembly on 16 November 1999,  the  National  Minister  of
     Health,  Dr  ME  Tshabalala-Msimang  stated  that  the  government  has
     declined to supply AZT to people infected with HIV/AIDS and people  who
     may have been infected through needle-pricks or through  rape,  on  two
     grounds - affordability and the  absence  of  proper  research  on  the
     possible harmful side-effects of AZT, in particular its toxic profile.


     Incarceration of Offenders


     * The Department of Correctional Services presented a submission to the
     Committee  describing  their  extensive  education  and  rehabilitative
     counselling programmes for inmates, and in particular  perpetrators  of
     sexual violence.
     * The department reported  on  their  education  programmes  for  women
     inmates (such as programmes on  adult  basic  education  and  training,
     reproductive health, including HIV/AIDS, parenting skills,  stress  and
     anger management, alcohol and drug abuse).
     * The department's policy stipulates  that  mothers  with  infants  and
     young children must be kept in a separate Mother and Child Unit;
     * It was also reported that the Department now had a programme by which
     all reasonable efforts were  made  to  notify  victims  of  the  parole
     hearings, and the release or escape of prisoners.
     * The Department's submission points out that a victim or  relative  is
     responsible to inform the  Commissioner  of  Correctional  Services  in
     writing of her contact details, change of address and costs incurred to
     attend the parole board hearings.
     * The Department also attempts to assist prisoners about to be released
     by way of counselling, accommodation  and  transport  arrangements  and
     community  integration  programmes  to  assist  prisoners   to   obtain
     employment on release.


     RECENT RESEARCH ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN


     Research reports on  violence  against  women  were  submitted  to  the
     Committee. However the limitations of the research, such  as,  specific
     geographic areas, and generalizations should be  guarded  against  when
     studying the findings. These difficulties highlight the necessity for a
     statistical data base on issues relating to violence against women  and
     children and gender attitudes. A selection  of  research  reports  have
     been placed in this summary report. For more details  of  all  research
     findings, please consult the complete report.


     SUMMARY OF RESEARCH


     UNISA's Institute for Social and Health Sciences presented  a  research
     report on rape surveillance based  on  district  surgeons'  offices  in
     Johannesburg from January 1996 to December 1998. It includes  Hillbrow,
     Lenasia South and Chris Hani Baragwanath medico-legal clinics:
     o 51% survivors were between ages 15 and 25.
     o 88.3% of rapes were perpetrated by a person of the same race group.
     o 58.2% of rapes occurred over  the  weekends,  and  43.7%  took  place
     between 18h01 and 0h00.
     o 44.7% survivors were acquainted with their perpetrators.
     o Younger victims were more likely to know their perpetrators.
     o 31% of rapes were committed in open fields, 29.1%  in  rapists  home,
     and 14.2% in victim's home.
     o 73% of rapes were committed by single perpetrator  and  27%  involved
     multiple attackers.
     o Weapons were used in 54.9% of  attacks:  mostly  knives  (50.9%)  and
     firearms (35.3%) In 85.5% of cases weapons were used only to threaten.


     UCT's Institute of Criminology's Gender, Law  and  Development  Project
     research submission undertaken in rural areas in  Southern  Cape  found
     that statistics and dynamics for rape are similar in  rural  and  urban
     areas, but access to justice and support differ enormously.  The  study
     revealed that:
     o Rural women experienced and witnessed  injuries  ranging  from  burns
     from boiling water to severe head injuries.  Participants stated  that,
     in their community, men  were  "professionals"  in  domestic  violence,
     hitting a woman on her body and not on her face, so that  the  injuries
     are not too identifiable, but when she has been accused of  infidelity,
     women sustain head and facial injuries "to make her ugly to other men".
     o  Participants  listed  domestic  violence,  alcoholism,  under-   and
     unemployment, the rape of women and property crime as major problems in
     their communities.
     o Rape and sexual molestation of children  were  seen  as  the  biggest
     threats to women and girl children in the communities.
     o Economic abuse was a notable feature of the research.
     o Women listed the following  causes  of  domestic  violence:  Lack  of
     respect for women, problems with  children,  unemployment  and  alcohol
     abuse, suspicion or jealousy and culture.
     o The report also lists the following reasons for the limited access to
     justice for rural women:
     o Economic disempowerment was mentioned  as  being  the  single  factor
     which prevented  women  from  removing  themselves  from  the  domestic
     violence.
     o Women in rural areas lack nearby services and the cost  of  transport
     decreases a woman's ability to leave violent situations  or  even  seek
     information or assistance to deal with the problem.
     o Limited access to state  and  private  health,  welfare  and  justice
     services results in systemic discrimination  by  the  state  in  almost
     every area of rural women's lives.
     o No accessible houses or shelters for women in rural areas.
     o Fears of community gossip or alienation  from  their  communities  if
     they seek assistance.
     o Very few development services exist in rural communities.
     The combined effects of poverty and violence for  rural  women  in  the
     Southern Cape create formidable barriers to  women's  equality,  mental
     and physical health, and their full  participation  in  civil  society.
     Current laws contain systemic inequalities, state legal structures  are
     inherently discriminatory against women and do not meet  the  needs  of
     rural women.


     The Medical Research Council's Centre for Epidemiological  Research  in
     South Africa (CERSA) presented three research reports at the  hearings.
     CERSA presented a research report on domestic  violence  based  on  the
     first major community-based prevalence study conducted among  women  in
     the Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga  and  the  Northern  Province.   Its  main
     findings were the following:
     o Emotional, financial  and  physical  abuse  are  common  features  of
     relationships and that many women have been raped.
     o Physical violence often continues during pregnancy and constitutes an
     important cause of reproductive morbidity.
     o Many women are injured by  their  partners  and  considerable  health
     sector resources are expended providing treatment for these injuries.
     o Injuries result in costs being incurred in other sectors, notable  to
     the family and the women's community and to employers in  the  national
     economy.
     o Considerable mental distress is associated with abuse.
     o There was considerable agreement with  patriarchal  gender  relations
     but women also indicated that the prevailing gender attitudes in  their
     culture was much more patriarchal than their personal views.
     o The report also mentions that  there  was  considerable  disagreement
     amongst the women about  the  meaning  attached  to  their  culture  to
     customs like lobola, indicating the possibility of  popular  discussion
     and examination of these traditions.
     o Research conducted amongst  pregnant  Xhosa-speaking  adolescents  in
     Khayalitsha  initially  intended  to  focus  on  contraception,  bodily
     knowledge and pregnancy, found that male violence dominated the  sexual
     relationships of these women.


     CERSA also reported on research conducted among young people in Umtata.
      Some of their key findings were the following:
     o Physical assault and rape  or  coercive  sex  was  reported  by  many
     participants.
     o Violence was used  by  boys  as  a  way  of  imposing  the  rules  of
     relationships and was particularly associated with girls' rejection  of
     "proposals of love", attempts to end relationships, refusals of sex and
     their actual or suspected infidelity.
     o Physical violence was a way of life for not only the  teenagers,  but
     in all community relationships.
     o  The  gender  identities  of  the  participants  were   substantially
     constructed in terms of their  success  in  sexual  relationships,  and
     pursuits of gaining and keeping boy- and girlfriend  were  overwhelming
     the preoccupation for those young people.
     o Neither teachers nor parents made any effort to promote  safe  dating
     or to interfere in the violent activities.


     The  1998  South  African  Demographic  and  Health   Survey   reported
     statistics on violence against women that were significantly lower than
     those reported by other studies.  The survey mentions that  the  under-
     reporting of gender violence is well recognised  and  should  be  taken
     into account in interpreting its results.  The Survey also records that
     one in five currently married  women  reported  economic  maltreatment,
     indicated by the regular non-provision  of  money  for  food,  rent  or
     bills, whilst having money for other things.


     Public Awareness and Education


     * It emerged strongly from the hearings that rape, sexual  assault  and
     domestic violence are more prevalent in South African society than ever
     recognised and that fear and expectations of violence is a way of  life
     for many South African women.
     * The hearings also shattered the common myth  that  the  rapist  is  a
     stranger who lurks in dark alleys.
     * Submissions  reportedly  mentioned  our  history  of  oppression  and
     disregard for human rights as the context  in  which  violence  against
     women flourished, and emphasised the importance of addressing  violence
     against women by placing it both  within  a  historical  and  political
     perspective and to recognise the influence of apartheid in the  present
     mindset of individuals, communities and society as a whole.
     * It was also argued that the division of the people  of  this  country
     according to race contributed to the  prevalence  of  violence  against
     women.
     * The Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation explored  the
     imbedded patriarchy which contribute to violence against women in South
     Africa. Imbedded Patriarchy refers to  the  ideology  of  granting  men
     power and privilege over women can be seen as the one  factor  unifying
     South Africa's various cultural and ethnic groups.  Patriarchy also has
     severe economic consequences for women, who are much more likely to  be
     unemployed and without access to any income of  their  own,  while  men
     control the allocation of household finances and  even  hamper  women's
     efforts  to  obtain  and  keep  employment,   leaving   women   totally
     financially dependent.
     * CERSA also reported deep-rooted patriarchy and a concomitant lack  of
     respect for women, who are often seen as the property of their husbands
     or father, or communities, as a  factor  in  the  scourge  of  violence
     against women.
     * Submissions also mentioned deepening levels of poverty and inequality
     in post-apartheid South Africa, which affects women more as  the  major
     component of the unemployed in South Africa.
     * Gendered constructions of male and female sexuality have created  the
     idea that men should be sexually active and women passive  and  without
     sexual desire. This implies to some men that women need to be forced to
     have sex in a context where it is not acceptable for women to  indicate
     her consent.
     * Research has shown a vast discrepancy in attitudes  to  the  fidelity
     required from men and women. It is acceptable  for  men  to  have  many
     sexual partners, but women are required to be faithful to one partner.
     * A submission also indicated that government  inaction  is  a  factor,
     which contributes to the high level of gender violence in societies.
     * Submissions also pointed out that, despite its wide-ranging powers to
     educate the public, the media was irresponsible  in  its  reporting  of
     violence  against  women,  perpetuating  stereotypes  and  relying   on
     sensationalism.
     * Both government submissions and those of NGOs  reported  an  enormous
     lack of understanding of violence against women by the public.
     * It was also apparent from the submissions that both men and women are
     uninformed about sex and sexual health and women are  therefore  unable
     to protect themselves and to provide information and support  to  other
     young women.
     * Various submissions stressed  the  importance  of  involving  men  in
     programmes on eradicating violence against women.
     * Although COSATU did not participate in the  hearings,  the  Committee
     Chair has addressed shop stewards in the COSATU violence against  women
     and HIV/AIDS campaigns.  COSATU has produced a guide for shop  stewards
     on these issues and is in the process of holding training workshops for
     its shop stewards.
     * Department of Education's Initiatives to Address the Issue:
     o In its  Gender  Equity  Task  Team  Report  (the  GETT  report),  the
     Department  of  Education  identified  the  following  issues   to   be
     considered and addressed relating  to  gender-sensitive  education  and
     violence against women:
     * Identifying means  of  correcting  gender  imbalances  in  enrolment,
     dropout rates, subject choice, career paths and performance.
     * The advantages and disadvantages of single sex schools.
     * Sexism in curricula, textbooks, teaching and guidance;
     * Sexism, sexual  harassment  and  violence  throughout  the  education
     system.
     The GETT report also lists the following recommendations:
     * That new legislation should be developed to make explicit  the  legal
     responsibilities of education  authorities  to  uphold  the  rights  of
     students to be free from discrimination and harassment.
     * That the National Department of Education should develop  an  interim
     policy on sex and gender based harassment and violence.
     * That the National Department of Education should develop  a  training
     package for educational managers on  their  responsibility  to  prevent
     discrimination, violence and harassment as well as curriculum  packages
     which incorporate learning about gender and violence at all  levels  of
     education.


     The Minister of Education made an  oral  submission  to  the  Committee
     regarding the Minister and the Department's efforts to address violence
     against women.  The following points were made:
     * The Department  of  Education's  1997  report  on  Gender  Equity  in
     Education dealt with sex based violence in schools.
     * The Director-General of Education reported to the Committee that,  in
     their attempts to include sex and gender education in  the  curriculum,
     they had initially experienced some resistance  from  sections  of  the
     communities who did not want to expose  small  children  to  issues  of
     sexuality.  It was hoped that the issue  could  be  more  appropriately
     addressed under the auspices of Curriculum 2005.
     * The Minister of Education reported that a gender  Equity  Directorate
     had been established in April 1999,  which  liases  with  Gender  Focal
     Points in  Provincial  Departments  through  the  National  Gender  Co-
     Ordination Committee.
     *  The  Education  Department  was  also  preparing   gender   training
     programmes for all national and provincial  officials,  as  well  as  a
     Mainstreaming Handbook for use by gender officers.
     * A school-based project on sex-based  and  gender-based  violence  and
     harassment was being developed.


     The Committee  would  like  to  receive  a  formal  response  from  the
     Department of Education on the following issues:
     * The Department's  efforts  to  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  not
     isolated to the Gender Equity Unit.
     * What  programmes  the  Department  is  planning  in  order  to  raise
     awareness about  sexism  and  violence  against  women  in  educational
     institutions and in particular the pre-service and in-service  training
     of teachers and to raise awareness in the general public.
     * The provision of extended day care facilities  for  younger  children
     and infants born to school girls.
     * The Department's investigation into the desirability  of  single  sex
     government schools and the possibility  of  teaching  certain  subjects
     separately to boys and girls.
     * The development of gender sensitive textbooks and curricula, as  well
     as the development of comprehensive  age-sensitive  and  sexual  health
     education.
     * The Department's efforts to improve the  education  and  Matric  pass
     rates and to decrease the  dropout  rate  of  girls,  especially  rural
     African and Coloured girls.


     * Other  important  theories  that  emerged  for  the  perpetuation  of
     violence against women in South Africa noted:
     o The intersection of race and gender  oppression  -  examples  of  the
     double burden of oppression  borne  by  black  women  are  slavery  and
     indentured servitude.  Women slaves and their  bodies  were  considered
     the property of their owners. A certain perception of how African women
     should be treated also emerged.
     o Changes in the social order - research has shown that an increase  in
     violence against women, and especially sexual violence often occurs  to
     changes in the social order.
     o Legitimising violence against women -  the  difficulties  created  by
     African traditional and customary law by adhering to customs  that  are
     oppressive to women.
     o Militarisation - the apartheid era militarisation of South Africa and
     the use of violent repression  together  with  anti-apartheid  movement
     decisions about education and armed reaction have  resulted  in  entire
     generations of 'lost' and violent young men and a  general  culture  of
     violence - where violence is seen as a  legitimate  means  of  conflict
     resolution.
     * In addition, a culture was cultivated in which qualities regarded  as
     'feminine'  is  treated  with  contempt  as  'weakness'  and  a  tough,
     aggressive, brutal and competitive masculinity is promoted.
     * Professor Jacklyn Cock similarly blamed the legacy of  militarisation
     which involves "a  proliferation  of  weaponry  and  ideas  which  link
     violence to masculinity".


     The Budget and Allocation of Resources


     * At a Cabinet meeting in 1996, the  Department  of  Finance  committed
     itself to considering  the  reallocation  of  military  expenditure  to
     support women's  economic  advancement.   In  1992/93,  the  Department
     reduced expenditure on Defence from 9.1% of total  government  spending
     to 5.7% in 1997/98.  Spending on social services increased  from  43.7%
     to 46.9%.
     * In its Second  Annual  Report  (January,  1998  -  March  1999),  the
     Committee recorded its formal questions to the Minister of Finance  on,
     inter alia, progress on the  Ministry's  1996  Cabinet  commitments  to
     reduce military expenditure and to utilise the savings towards  women's
     empowerment.  The report further indicates that, in a  briefing  on  16
     March 1998, the Minister indicated that military spending had decreased
     from 4.5% of GDP in 1993/94 to 1.5% in 1999/2000,  and  that  the  main
     beneficiaries of this decrease had  been  the  Departments  of  Health,
     Education and Welfare.
     * Yet in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statements, the  average  annual
     growth in present and projected proportional  expenditure  for  Defence
     and Intelligence was 14.9%, more than double the figure for  any  other
     services, including Education, Health and Welfare.
     * The Department of Finance was invited by  the  Committee  to  present
     submissions at the hearings.  Although the Deputy Minister attended the
     hearings, he advised the Committee that the  Department  had  not  been
     able to prepare a submission to the Committee.  To date, the  Committee
     has not received a response to questions posed to the  Deputy  Minister
     at the hearings.
     * The Committee requires an urgent  response  from  the  Department  of
     Finance on the following issues:
     o The  Department's  efforts  to  address  the  unemployment  of  women
     formerly employed in the clothing and textile industries caused by  the
     liberalisation of trade policy as a means of increasing competitiveness
     in the manufacturing sector.
     * Various projects in  the  Victim  Empowerment  Programme  (VEP)  were
     intended to focus on issues relating  to  violence  against  women  and
     children.   However,  very  few  of  these  projects  have  sustainable
     funding, and many of the projects were only intended to operate for one
     year:
     o "Multi-disciplinary Management of Child Abuse and  Neglect"  -  Donor
     funding of R2 million paid for the 1998/99 year of operation,  for  the
     1999/2001 years, "alternate sources of funding" would be sought.
     o "Primary Health Care  Model  to  Reduce  the  Risk  of  Interpersonal
     Violence" - this was only intended to  be  a  one-year  project  to  be
     implemented during 1998/99, with funding of R400 000 sourced  from  the
     VEP.
     o  "Violence  Referral  Centres"  -  a  pilot  programme  to  establish
     "Violence Referral Management  Centres  in  four  provinces,  receiving
     referrals from frontline  staff":   This  project  was  similarly  only
     intended to be a one-year project to be implemented during 1998/99 at a
     cost of R510 000, funded by the VEP.
     o "Outreach Centres to Counteract  Domestic  Violence"  -  a  programme
     designed to give support for the establishment of outreach  centres  in
     provinces to expand services to victims of  domestic  violence.   Donor
     funding of R1.2 million paid for the implementation of this project  in
     Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape, whilst the VEP paid R1.2  million  for
     its implementation in the North-West Province and the Free State.   The
     VEP would pay R3 million for its implementation in the  remaining  five
     provinces in 2000/01.  "Alternate funding" would be sought during  1998
     for the continued operation of these programmes.
     o R65 000 was budgeted from the VEP for "Access to Legal Provisions  to
     Counter-Act Domestic Violence in Rural Communities", a project intended
     to be operational during 1998/99.
     o "Violence Prevention  in  Schools",  a  project  implemented  by  the
     Department of Health (in conjunction with the  US  Centre  for  Disease
     Control for the 1998/99 year at a cost of R65 000, funded by the VEP.
     o "National Policy Guidelines  on  Victims  of  Sexual  Offences"  -  a
     project  encompassing  nine  provincial  workshops  to  train   service
     providers on the basis of the  national  policy  guidelines  on  sexual
     offences - this project was funded by the VEP at a  cost  of  R150  000
     during 1998/99.
     o "Victim Empowerment in Schools  -  Life  Skills  Curriculum"  -  this
     project was funded by the VEP at a cost of R150 000, and intended to be
     a one-year project during 1998/99.
     o The VEP paid for a training course for the SAPS entitled "Victims  of
     Violence:  Domestic  Violence  and  Sexual   Offences   Case   Handling
     Training", at a cost of R100 000 for 1998/99; funding for 1999/2000 and
     2000/01 "to be secured in order to extend it to these two years".
     o An information and public awareness project hosted by the  Department
     of Welfare, funded until 2001 by the VEP.
     * In its  Second  Annual  Report  (January  1998  -  March  1999),  the
     Committee reported that no specific budgetary allocations had been made
     for violence against  women,  unlike  other  crimes  declared  priority
     crimes in terms of the National  Crime  Prevention  Strategy,  such  as
     hijacking.  Similarly, departments such as Safety and Security did  not
     have specific, separate budget allocations for violence against women.
     * The exclusion of victims of  domestic  violence  from  the  Fund  for
     Victims of Violent Crime Bill;
     * The Commission for Gender Equality also raised the issue of involving
     the private sector in programmes addressing violence against women.
     * Various submissions to the  Committee  mentioned  that  the  cost  of
     violence  against  women  in  South  Africa,  and  especially  domestic
     violence, has been calculated due to ineffective documentation of these
     incidents by the health and criminal justice sectors.  These costs  are
     both public and private, paid for by women and their families.
     * Calculating the real economic costs may be hampered by the fact  that
     violence against women is under-reported, prenatal damage caused by the
     abuse  of  pregnant  women  is   difficult   to   quantify,   long-term
     consequences such as inter-generational transfers of violent  behaviour
     cannot be accurately estimated and private costs  to  women  cannot  be
     captured.


     Inter-Ministerial Co-Operation and Co-Operative Governance


     * The National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS), adopted by the Cabinet
     in May 1996, is the government's flagship inter-departmental  programme
     in its efforts to combat crime.   One  of  the  NCPS  programmes  which
     affects issues of violence against  women  is  the  Victim  Empowerment
     Programme,  hosted  by  the  core  NCPS  departments,  namely  Justice,
     Welfare, the SAPS, Safety and Security and Correctional  Services,  but
     also involves the Departments of Health and  Education  and  Provincial
     Departments;
     * The Office on the Status  of  Women  (OSW)  was  established  in  the
     President's Office.  R1.5 million of the OSW's funding of R2.5  million
     for 1998/99 was donor funding, which terminated in  August  1999.   The
     budget for 1999/2000 only covers salaries and administration;
     * During 1999, the OSW advised the Committee that it was  developing  a
     Green Paper on a National Gender Policy to be passed by the Cabinet.
     * On 15 March 1999, the OSW also advised  the  Committee  that  it  was
     conducting a gender  audit  on  internal  transformation  and  external
     service delivery of all government departments and all  the  provinces,
     with a view to developing a national action plan.
     * Although the Department of Foreign Affairs was not requested  by  the
     Committee to participate in the November 1999 hearings,  the  Committee
     would like to know whether and when a gender desk will  be  established
     in the Department.  The Committee also requires  information  regarding
     the Department's efforts to set up international links to international
     trafficking in women and prostitution.
     * In view of various submissions relating to  women's  difficulties  in
     escaping situations of especially domestic violence due to  a  lack  of
     access to alternative housing, the Committee also requires  a  response
     from the Department of Housing and Agriculture and Land  Affairs  (both
     of whom were not requested to participate in  the  hearings)  on  their
     efforts to ensure that women  are  not  discriminated  against  in  the
     granting of housing subsidies, access to rural housing and  rural  land
     allocation.  The Committee is particularly interested in  the  progress
     and achievements of the Women for Housing Group in  the  Department  of
     Housing with reference to their April  1998  draft  document  entitled,
     "Guiding Principles and Practice Relating to Women's Housing Issues".


     Co-Operation between Government and Civil Society


     * Numerous submissions mentioned the importance  of  an  inter-sectoral
     approach, involving both government and civil  society,  in  addressing
     violence against women.
     * The  National  Network  on  Violence  against  Women  has  been  most
     successful in bringing together government and civil society on  issues
     relating to violence against women.   The  Department  of  Welfare  has
     formed a partnership with the  National  Network  on  Violence  against
     Women and the Network has received financial and administrative support
     from the Department.  The Department of Health also participates in the
     National Network on Violence against Women.
     * The Committee was told  of  the  involvement  of  organisations  like
     People Opposed to Women  Abuse  in  programmes  of  the  Department  of
     Correctional Services.
     * At the same time, many NGOs mentioned their prime difficulty being  a
     lack of funding, and that most of their time was spent on  fund-raising
     instead of addressing their substantive goals.


     The Need for a Statistical Database


     * In South Africa, there has been a  notable  lack  of  community-based
     data and reliable statistics on violence against  women  and  children,
     its prevalence and  epidemiological  studies  of  risk  factors.   Most
     research undertaken on violence against women in South Africa has  been
     relatively small-scale, localised or has  focused  on  particular  sub-
     groups, e.g. health service users.
     * Research efforts on the prosecution of  sexual  offences  cases  were
     made extremely difficult through  the  absence  of  any  record  system
     whatsoever by court officials, and police dockets and court files which
     were incomplete.  Further, there is no official  record  of   how  many
     women phone police stations when they are in a  crisis  or  when  their
     lives are endangered.
     * Disaggregation of data and the devising of protocols around  domestic
     violence may yield  better  data  and  the  Department  of  Safety  and
     Security is best positioned to do this.
     * In its 1998 White Paper, the Department of Safety and Security stated
     that it aims to improve the reliability of crime statistics in general.
      The Committee will  request  the  Department  to  furnish  it  with  a
     progress report in this regard.


     Recommendations and Queries to Government Departments
     (Submissions to this section were received from various stakeholders  -
     please refer to full document for details)


     Criminal Justice
     The Committee recommends:
     * that the availability of and access to legal aid  to  women  who  are
     victims of violence be given urgent  consideration  by  the  Legal  Aid
     Board and the Department of Justice;
     *  that  urgent  attention  be  given  to  the  appointment   of   more
     prosecutors, intermediaries, interpreters and magistrates, and that the
     Department of Justice allocate resources for this purpose;
     * that clerks of the  court,  who  will  be  the  point  of  entry  for
     complainants in terms of  the  new  Domestic  Violence  Act,  be  given
     mandatory training in gender sensitivity and the effects and nature  of
     domestic violence;
     * that the establishment of  more  Sexual  Offence  and  Family  Courts
     receive priority;
     * that attention be  given  by  the  Judicial  Service  Commissions  to
     sensitivity to gender issues in the appointment of High Court Judges;
     * that gun control laws be enforced more strictly.
     Law Enforcement
     The Committee recommends:
     * That more female officers be made available to  assist  survivors  of
     violence;
     * That the Department of Safety  and  Security  allocate  resources  to
     establish a proper surveillance and data collection system which  would
     make it possible, inter alia,  to  identify  specific  locations  where
     attacks on women regularly occur and to identify reasons for  the  non-
     prosecution of violence against women;
     * That more police stations  be  established  and  equipped,  including
     satellite police stations, especially in the rural and poorer areas;
     * That urgent attention be given to more visible  street  policing  and
     street lighting;
     * That the Department of Safety  and  Security  allocate  resources  to
     engage the services of experienced  trainers  from  reputable  NGOs  to
     train members of the police in:
     o The devastating effect of violence against women, including  domestic
     violence which is often treated by police officers as "unimportant";
     o Sensitive treatment of traumatised survivors of rape, sexual  assault
     and violence against women in general;
     o The various legal remedies available to survivors  of  violence.   It
     appeared from various submissions that complainants often relied on the
     police for advice on her choice of  remedy.   In  some  cases,  it  was
     reported that police try to dissuade women from laying charges  against
     perpetrators by stressing  negative  consequences  for  women  if  they
     insist on the arrest of the offender;
     o Accurate and adequate forensic  investigations  for  the  purpose  of
     criminal prosecution.


     Welfare Services and Shelters
     The Committee recommends:
     * That the Department of Welfare embark on extensive  training  of  its
     officials to equip them to deal  with  survivors  of  violence  against
     women;
     * That both government and civil society give urgent attention  to  the
     establishment of shelters for abused women.  This is also a project  in
     which the private  sector  can  make  a  specific  and  greatly  needed
     contribution towards assisting women to  remove  themselves  and  their
     children from situations of violence.


     Health Care
     The Committee recommends:
     * The incorporation of treatment of the survivors  of  sexual  violence
     and other violence against women in the curriculum for the training  of
     doctors, nurses and other health workers.   Such  treatment  must  also
     incorporate an understanding of the trauma experienced by the survivor.
     * That urgent attention be given to the availability  of  treatment  of
     rape survivors of STD's and other health risks, and that the Department
     of Health prioritises establishing the effectiveness of anti-retroviral
     drugs like AZT for rape survivors;
     * That urgent attention be given to  women's  access  to  health  care,
     especially rural women;
     * That priority be given to the expansion of the existing  project  for
     the training of forensic nurses; and
     * That the removal of question 11(e) from Form J88 be considered.


     Incarceration of Offenders
     The Committee recommends that:
     *  The  Department   investigates   the   implementation   of   weekend
     incarceration, especially of perpetrators of domestic violence;
     * A fund be created to which victims or relatives  can  apply  to  fund
     expenses related to attending parole hearings;
     * A fund be created to assist prisoners who become victims of violence.


     Public Awareness and Education
     The Committee recommends that:
     * An extensive public awareness campaign in all languages  through  the
     use of electronic and print media about the right of women to  be  free
     of violence.  Such campaigns must address both women and men  and  must
     target rural areas in an accessible way.  It is  also  imperative  that
     community  organisations,  especially  religious   organisations,   are
     involved in the campaign on an  on-going  basis  and  that  influential
     people in the  community  (including  politicians,  religious  leaders,
     business leaders and youth organisations) on national,  provincial  and
     local level, make public statements in support of the campaign.
     * That the Department of Justice drives  a  public  education  campaign
     focussing on legal remedies available  to  women  who  are  victims  of
     violence, and in particular the provisions  of  the  Domestic  Violence
     Act.
     * Proper education on sex, sexual health, the crime of violence against
     women  and  alternative  conflict  resolution  mechanisms  (other  than
     violence) -
     o As part of the school curriculum, taught at an age-appropriate  level
     from an early age.  Such programmes must also focus on the  development
     of self-reliance and self-esteem for both girls  and  boys.   Attention
     also need to be given to teacher-training to ensure that teachers  feel
     qualified to deliver such education.
     o For parents by way of national workshops and  seminars  on  parenting
     skills.
     o For men through employee's organisations and unions.  Changing  men's
     perceptions should receive high priority as  a  mainstream  issue,  and
     provision should be  made  for  both  primary  prevention  as  well  as
     secondary prevention, such as counselling programmes for abusers.
     o In communities by representatives of the police,  welfare  and  legal
     services, utilising the network of as many community  organisations  as
     possible, including women's organisations, specifically to reach  women
     who have already left school and unemployed men.
     Such education should address, inter alia, the following questions:
     o What is love?  In what ways can it be demonstrated?
     o What do young people do sexually?  Why do people have sex?
     o Do men and women have equal sexual rights?
     o What kinds of relationship can young people have?
     o What alternative sexual practices are there?
     o How can men and women communicate about sexual matters?
     o Who says no to sex, and how?  Who can ask for it?
     o Who has or is allowed to have multiple sexual partners?  And why?
     o What is sexual abuse and violence?
     o When and why does violence occur within relationships?
     o Is violence acceptable within relationships?
     o How can potentially violent situations be dealt with?


     It appeared from numerous submissions that the lack of  employment  and
     realisable aspirations among especially young men  contributed  towards
     abuse of women though  displacement  of  frustrations  onto  vulnerable
     partners, as well as through  increased  drug  and  alcohol  use.   The
     Committee therefore recommends that government prioritises job creation
     in areas where abuse is most prevalent.


     Tracking the Changes after the November 1999 Hearings


     From 2000 to 2001
     Visits to various provinces by members of the Committee were undertaken
     in April and June 2000 with a view  to  meet  with  Magistrates,  South
     African Police Services Commissioners and
     Prosecutors.   These  meetings   formed   part   of   the   Committee's
     investigation  into  the  difficulties   experienced   by   the   SAPS,
     Magistrates and Prosecutors in each of the  provinces  to  monitor  the
     implementation of the National Instruction on the Domestic Violence and
     Maintenance Act.  A delegation  of  the  Committee  visited  Nelspruit,
     Mpumalanga on 17 April 2000, Pietersburg, Northern Province on  the  19
     June 2000, Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape on the 19  June  2000  and  the
     Western Cape.


     The issues highlighted below are  prevalent  to  a  greater  or  lesser
     degree in all areas that these investigations took place.


     Domestic Violence
     * Application forms for domestic violence interdicts  -  shorter  forms
     were requested, more staff are required.
     * Director Singani, Crime  Prevention,  informed  the  delegation  that
     victims are given a choice on whether they want to open a case or get a
     protection order.  Normally victims choose the latter and do  not  want
     to open a case.  The SAPS need more staff to cope with filling  of  the
     forms.


     Public Education
     * Public is illiterate and uninformed about the legislation.
     * The public is often referred back to the police by  the  magistrate's
     courts.  People get shifted from pillar to  post.   It  is  problematic
     just get more personpower to help with filling in the forms.


     Training and Restructuring
     * Training of police officers is ongoing;
     * Director  Singani  mentioned  the  possibility  of  getting  a  small
     structure  to  deal  with  domestic  violence  cases,  because   police
     officials are taken away from their ordinary duties.  The SAPS  has  to
     send two police officers to escort victims,  which  takes  up  to  five
     hours.  There needs to be a clarification of guidelines on the division
     of labour.
     * Director Singani also indicated that there are no clear guidelines on
     who needs to be doing what, and said that the  SAPS  cannot  deal  with
     both, but they needed a subsection to deal with the matters.
     Note from clerk: it is apparent that even senior SAPS  officers  regard
     the problem of violence against women as something that is not part  of
     their ordinary work, but an extra burden placed on them.  This attitude
     is alarming and an undertaking must be obtained from  the  Minister  of
     Safety and Security that this mater will be dealt with immediately  and
     effectively.


     Manpower and Language
     * Director Singani pointed out that when the applicant is  referred  to
     the police for assistance with filling in the forms,  the  police  have
     the problem that they do not have the necessary personpower to  assist.
     He argued that  capacity  must  be  built  at  magistrate  courts,  for
     example, translators must be appointed.  He complained that  they  only
     want to deal with the protection side of matters and this can  only  be
     done if there is more capacity but they do not have the time.


     After-Hours Assistance
     * Director Singani stated there  were  problems  getting  the  required
     assistance after hours with regard to applications.  In  Sheshego,  the
     magistrates have set certain  hours  to  deal  with  domestic  violence
     cases, up to 12h00, for instance.
     * When victims go to the police station to deal with the problem, women
     use interdicts to cover other matters and most cases are withdrawn.


     Transport
     * The SAPS do not have enough vehicles to fulfil its  transport  duties
     toward victims.  There was a shortage of manpower and members still had
     to manage their work in the time required.  There was  an  appeal  that
     this problem be addressed.


     Shelters
     * Shelters are mostly under the management of men.   Suspects  complain
     that their wives are given to other men.  There is  a  perception  that
     this is a cultural matter.  Some shelters are not open for 24 hours.


     Jurisdiction
     * The areas of jurisdiction of the SAPS and the magistrate's courts are
     not exactly the same.  Police officers often go outside of  their  area
     of jurisdiction at times,  although  a  certain  area  may  be  in  the
     magisterial district.  The SAPS has to apply for permission to  operate
     outside their jurisdiction, but a senior officer may not  be  available
     at that crucial time.  If jurisdictions could be  matched  exactly,  it
     would save on time and labour.


     Addresses
     * Victims or suspects often do not have proper addresses, because  they
     live in rural areas.


     Magistrates
     Personpower and Language


     * An official informed the  delegation  that  the  magistrates  in  the
     Northern Province were experiencing  the  same  problems  as  those  in
     Mpumalanga. They have a shortage of personpower. His civil section  has
     three clerks and they do full-time domestic violence  complaints  work.
     On the return date, it often happens that the respondent approaches the
     court to have the order set aside.  The civil  trial  gets  too  little
     attention.
     * He pointed out that the civil section is chaotic as the three  clerks
     have to fill in all the forms and they experience problems because of a
     language barrier;
     * Clerks sometimes refer the complainants to  the  SAPS  to  help  with
     filling in the forms.  They need more staff for the completion of forms
     and for trials.  Other sections of work are being neglected;
     * Over 30 000 documents are served per annum.  Domestic violence places
     another burden on the section.


     Restructuring


     * Additional posts should be created in order to render services;
     * Many magistrates' offices are using an organogram that  has  been  in
     operation for 30 years - it has not been upgraded.


     Financial Implications of the Domestic Violence Act
     * The Domestic Violence Act has financial  implications  that  has  not
     been accounted for.  The sheriff has to be paid  and  magistrates  have
     pleaded that the Sheriffs delay billing until the next financial year.


     Prosecutors
     Staff


     * The three divisions - Administration, Prosecution and Magistrates  do
     not communicate.  The Act implies that they have certain  duties.  Acts
     were passed but due to  lack  of  additional  staff,  there  are  major
     problems.  Furthermore, when cases have to go to court, the application
     is withdrawn and the process is often repeated.
     *  At  times,  the  magistrate  with  civil  court  also   deals   with
     applications for victims of domestic violence.  The workload is immense
     and magistrates themselves need more assistance.


     Jurisdiction


     *  The  discrepancies  in  the  jurisdictions  of  the  SAPS  and   the
     magistrates' courts - many problems are encountered as the SAPS  nearby
     may want to bring a case before the court but the  magistrate  may  not
     act because his jurisdiction is elsewhere.


     Inter-Departmental Co-Ordination


     * There was a request that an  agreement  be  worked  out  between  the
     Departments of Justice and Safety and Security  to  co-ordinate  cases.
     This will result in a better flow of case.  There has  to  be  a  joint
     venture between Justice and the police to interrogate the  Act  and  to
     assist with the smooth running of the implementation.


     Problems with Act


     * The Act makes no provision for cases where violence occurs before the
     interim order has run out and the final order is in place.


     Training of SAPS


     * Members of the SAPS have not received sufficient training with regard
     to domestic violence.


     Department of Health and Welfare


     Bureaucratic and Practical Stumbling Blocks


     * In rural areas, there are no specific medical facilities for  victims
     - a clinic is open for certain hours and days.
     * Medical facilities have been decentralised to be accessed by all.;
     * When domestic violence victims seek help, and  if  they  have  a  J88
     form, they cannot be helped as there  may  be  no  doctor  present  and
     therefore they will have to go to a hospital.
     * Victims are often not accompanied as the SAPS do not  have  transport
     or the staff to handle this aspect.
     * Many rape victims are taken to hospitals where there  is  a  lack  of
     crime kits and other forms, which  would  be  available  if  they  were
     accompanied.


     Statistics


     * There are only statistics for  rape  victims  and  not  for  domestic
     violence assault, only for assault.  A new form is in  the  process  of
     being compiled and developed  which  will  help  record  statistics  to
     separate domestic violence cases from assault cases. This form will now
     be filled in at hospitals.


     The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement  of  the  Quality  of
     Life and Status of Women


     Summary Report on Violence Against Women
     October 2001


     Introduction


     The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement  of  the  Quality  of
     Life and Status of Women (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) was
     permanently established in June 1998 to monitor  and  oversee  progress
     with regard to the improvement of the quality of  life  and  status  of
     women in South Africa.  The Committee's specific brief  is  to  monitor
     government's commitments  made  at  the  United  Nations  Fourth  World
     Conference in Beijing in 1995 and the provisions of the United  Nations
     Convention on the Elimination of all Forms  of  Discrimination  against
     Women (CEDAW) in 1995.


     The South African government signed and ratified CEDAW  and  government
     departments tabled their commitments to the Beijing Platform of  Action
     (BPFA) in February 1996.  Both CEDAW and  the  BPFA  detail  a  state's
     obligation to introduce measures to protect the  rights  of  women  and
     mechanisms to eliminate gender-based violence.


     The Committee's hearings on violence against women were held  from  8th
     to 17th November  1999.   The  objectives  of  the  hearings  were  the
     following:


     * To identify the blockages which impede women's access to justice.
     * To determine the varied ways in which such obstacles to  justice  can
     be addressed and eliminated.
     All submissions of the 1999 hearings are available from  the  Clerk  of
     this Committee.


     Subsequent to the 1999 hearings, the Joint Monitoring Committee on  the
     Improvement of the Quality of Life and Status of Women either initiated
     or participated in various forums highlighting gender violence in South
     Africa.  These were:


     * The provincial visits to 3 provinces by a delegation from the  JMC  -
     17 April 2000 - Nelsruit, Mpumalanga; 19 June 2000 - Port Elizabeth and
     Pietersburg;
     * The joint 2-day workshop between the JMC and the Public Participatory
     Unit (PPU) of Parliament, 25 - 26 July 2001, Parliament, Cape Town.
     * The rural road shows held in conjunction with the PPU.


     An Overview - Violence against Women Hearings, November 1999


     Submissions from the hearings noted the many achievements made  by  the
     state in addressing and confronting the issue of gender-based violence.
     The state at the highest policy  level  has  committed  itself  to  the
     elimination of gender violence.  The preamble to the Domestic  Violence
     Act 116 of 1998 makes clear this intention as it sets this  legislation
     out as "providing victims with the maximum protection,  which  the  law
     can provide'.  In addition to the Domestic Violence Act,  the  criminal
     justice system  began  the  process  of  transformation  with  proposed
     legislation to improve the  lives  of  women  confronting  the  justice
     system.  The South African Law Commission's Sexual Offences  Discussion
     Paper incorporates a proposed Sexual  Offences  Bill.   SALC  has  also
     produced a discussion paper on procedural aspects of the prosecution of
     sexual offences.


     Specific Impediments to the Implementation  of  the  Domestic  Violence
     (DVA) and Issues Pertaining to Sexual Offences - Submissions181
     The following crucial points were raised at the hearings in written and
     oral form.  It must be pointed out that the hearings were  held  before
     the implementation of the DVA (December  1999)  and  these  submissions
     highlight the perceived problems  that  would  be  encountered.   These
     were:
     * Women's inability to access their rights due  to  lack  of  knowledge
     around the DVA.
     * Discretion of magistrates in sentencing procedures.
     * Legal representation is too costly and therefore  disadvantages  many
     poor women.
     * Education for the judiciary, for example, clerks of  the  court,  are
     inadequate.
     * Inaccessibility to  police  stations  and  courts  due  to  transport
     problems make it difficult for women to report and follow up  and  thus
     recourse to the DVA would not be fully utilised.
     * Whilst  the  legal  aspects  of  the  DVA  are  technically  correct,
     activists argue that support mechanisms to ensure  the  eradication  of
     domestic violence is lacking.
     * Misconception around domestic violence even amongst victims is  still
     viewed as a "private family matter".
     * Language barriers and staff shortages  further  exacerbate  the  full
     implementation of the DVA.
     * The 13 forms required to implement the DVA were still not printed.
     * Negative  experiences  of  courts  in  general,  which  is  a  direct
     consequence of a lack of adequate facilities  and  human  resources  to
     handle victims of gender violence. There are massive backlogs of cases,
     which cause delays of about nine months between complaint and trial.
     * A definite need for the reconsideration of the adversarial system  in
     sexual offences cases.
     * Prosecutors and magistrates need training  on  non-legal  aspects  of
     gender-based violence.
     * South Africa should seek ways to ensure that  women  can  access  the
     justice system.


     The above were some of the key concerns raised  at  the  1999  November
     hearings.  For more detail, see the summary report of July 2000 and the
     comprehensive report of February 2000.


     Key departments and various stakeholders involved in addressing gender-
     based violence have pointed out the progress that  have  been  made  in
     terms of programmes, budgetary requirements and policies that will  aid
     the process towards the eradication of gender-based  violence.   For  a
     full list of submissions made by key departments, please refer  to  the
     February 2000 report.


     Findings from provincial visits (2000)/workshop (2001) and  road  shows
     (2001) to monitor the gaps found in the implementation of the  Domestic
     Violence Act of 1998.


     Visits to various provinces by members of the Committee were undertaken
     in April and June 2000 with a view to meet with magistrates, the  South
     African Police Services (SAPS) Commissioners  and  prosecutors.   These
     meetings  formed  part  of  the  Committee's  investigation  into   the
     difficulties experienced by the SAPS, magistrates  and  prosecutors  in
     each of the provinces to monitor the  implementation  of  the  National
     Instruction on the Domestic Violence and Maintenance  Act  (Act  99  of
     1998).  A delegation of  the  Committee  visited  three  provinces  and
     visits to the remaining provinces are envisaged in the year 2002.


     Some of the key concerns  highlighted  by  participants  at  the  above
     interactive sessions revealed the following problems (to  a  lesser  or
     greater degree in  different  areas)  encountered  by  women  "victims"
     accessing the justice system:
     * Application forms for domestic violence interdicts were too  lengthy.
     Shorter forms were requested.
     * More staff is required to assist women at various stages.
     * The public is still illiterate and uninformed about the legislation.
     *  Although  training  of  police  officers  is  ongoing,  there  is  a
     perception among certain SAP officials that violence against  women  is
     something that is not part of their ordinary work, but an extra  burden
     placed on them.
     * Lack of staff in certain courts and police  stations  further  hamper
     the process.
     * Language issues and lack of translators  at  some  assistance  points
     were lacking.
     * There are problems with receiving the required assistance after hours
     with regard to applications.
     * Lack of vehicles to fulfil duties toward victims.
     * Shelters for women are mostly under the management of men.
     * The areas of jurisdiction of the SAPS  and  the  magistrates'  courts
     also pose a problem.
     * The Domestic Violence Act has financial implications and all  aspects
     have not been fully covered.
     * The Act makes no provision for cases where violence occurs before the
     interim order has run out and the final order is in place.
     * In rural areas, there are no specific medical facilities for  victims
     as clinics are only open on certain days and for specific hours.
     * Rape victims are taken into hospitals where there is a lack of  crime
     kits and the necessary forms required.


     Recommendations


     Stakeholders from various sectors at the 1999 hearings, the 2000 visits
     to the three provinces and the 2001 road shows and workshop recommended
     that:


     * The availability of and access to legal aid to women who are  victims
     of  violence  be  given  urgent  consideration  by   the   stakeholders
     concerned.
     * Urgent attention be given to increasing staff in key departments that
     work on gender-based violence.
     * Both government and  civil  society  give  urgent  attention  to  the
     establishment of shelters for abused women.  This is also a project  in
     which the private  sector  can  make  a  specific  and  greatly  needed
     contribution.
     * Urgent attention be given to the availability of  treatment  of  rape
     survivors of STD's and other health risks, and that the  Department  of
     Health prioritises establishing the  effectiveness  of  anti-retroviral
     drugs like AZT for rape survivors.
     * An extensive public awareness campaign be undertaken in all languages
     through the use of electronic and print media about the rights of women
     to be free of violence.  Such campaigns must  address  both  women  and
     men, and must target rural areas in an accessible way.
     * Proper education on sex, sexual health, the crime of violence against
     women  and  alternative  conflict  resolution  mechanisms  (other  than
     violence) at all levels in society be done.
     * Investigate the possibilities of weekend incarceration, especially of
     perpetrators of domestic violence.
     * Children have emerged as silent witnesses in domestic  violence.   An
     integrated approach is key to assist women and children  to  deal  with
     the effects of violence. Support services to assist women and  children
     should be linked to the courts.
     * The application forms should be simplified.
     * The judicial process should allow for women to be debriefed after the
     hearing in  order  for  her  to  fully  understand  the  terms  of  the
     protection order and how it can facilitate her protection.

     Conclusion


     The legislative process in terms of  addressing  gender-based  violence
     and increasing women's substantive equality in South Africa  is  highly
     commendable if one  notes  the  time-  period  in  which  changes  were
     effected.  However, for the cycle of violence to  be  broken  in  South
     Africa, the interlinkages  and  crosscutting  issues  between  violence
     against women, poverty and HIV/AIDS within  the  development  framework
     needs to be more thoroughly scrutinised.

     2 Address to the Nation on National Women's Day, 9 August 1999
     3 Article 1 of Annex F to CEDAW
     4 Article 2 of Annex F to CEDAW
     5 Article 4(d) of Annex F to CEDAW
     6 Act 116 of 1998
     7 Act 133 of 1993
     8 Criminal Procedure Amendment Act 75 of 1995
     9 Criminal Procedure Amendment Act 105 of 1997
     10     It was decided that this kind of provision is perhaps better and
           more suitably located within the revised and comprehensive Child
           Care Act 74 of 1983.
     11      Though  this  is  comprehensively  dealt  with  in  the  Labour
           Relations Act 66 of 1995, it means that people in employment are
           protected from sexual harassment. It seems clear that there  are
           other areas where this is likely to  take  place.  Thus  further
           investigations and proposals  will  need  to  be  made  in  this
           regard.
     12     The Commission on Gender Equality reported to the Committee that
           it was in the process of conducting research  on  judgements  on
           rape, as well as drafting of  sexual  offences  legislation  and
           other legislation which impact on women.
           In its June 1998 report on the Violence Against Women  Hearings,
           the Committee described a submission by Rape  Crisis  and  UWC's
           Community Law Centre regarding the Namibian draft bill on sexual
           assault. This bill dealt with, inter  alia,  a  redefinition  of
           rape, minimum  sentences  for  rapists,  order  for  payment  of
           compensation to the complainant, mandatory commencement of  rape
           trials within three months of  date  of  arrest,  disallowing  a
           negative inference based solely  on  the  length  of  the  delay
           between the alleged rape and the  laying  of  a  complaint,  the
           right of a complainant to be legally represented during criminal
           proceedings, and the prohibition of  evidence  relating  to  the
           previous sexual history of the complainant.
     13     Submission H
     14     Submission Y
     15     The President  of  the  Regional  Court  for  the  Western  Cape
           reported that there was currently a backlog of 7000 cases in the
           Western  Cape  regional  courts.   The  present  delay   between
           complaint and trial was approximately 9 months.
     16     The SAPS's submission on its Family violence,  Child  Protection
           and Sexual Offences Units specifically mentions the difficulties
           caused  by  numerous  postponements  of  cases  involving  child
           witnesses, as well as trauma suffered by a child  witness  as  a
           result of a postponement.

     19     As appears from the Committee's Second  Annual  Report  (January
           1998 - March 1999), page 15, initially only 200  copies  of  the
           Guidelines  were  distributed.   When   the   Committee   raised
           concerns, the Department raised  donor  funding  to  ensure  the
           printing of sufficient numbers of copies of the Guidelines.

     89     In its 1998 report, the Department of Justice reported back on a
           Canadian study tour on dealing with violence against women,  and
           in  the  lessons  drawn  from  the  tour  listed  the  need  for
           rehabilitation for offenders.  This issue  was  also  raised  by
           UWC's Community Law Centre.

           permitted to have her child with her until  the  child  is  five
           years of age.
     91     The research report points out  that,  when  interpreting  these
           statistics, one  should  bear  in  mind  that  the  sample  only
           represents reported rapes.

     101    Finding of a research report  conducted  by  the  University  of
           South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences on  rape
           surveillance at the  Hillbrow,  Lenasia  South  and  Chris  Hani
           Baragwanath medico-legal clinics.  This report also found  that,
           in cases of multiple attackers, the attack was more likely to be
           perpetrated by strangers to the  victim,  and  in  open  spaces;
           single perpetrators were more likely to attack victims they knew
           and 48,2% of such attacks occurred in homes.  These findings are
           echoed in  the  research  findings  among  rural  women  in  the
           Southern Cape by UCT's Institute of  Criminology's  Gender,  Law
           and Development Project, which records that, in 55% of the rapes
           reported in their study, victims knew the offender by name or by
           sight.

     113    In its submission, UCT's Institute of Criminology's  Gender  Law
           and Development Project reported that women who were victims  of
           violence received little  or  no  support  from  family  or  the
           community;  women were often too scared of retaliation  to  help
           other women, and the  survivor  feared  public  humiliation  and
           ostracism by family and friends should she speak out.
