                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek  by  die  volgende  sitting
van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) die ANC-regering versoek om  ernstige  oorweging  te  skenk  aan  die
       effektiewe funksionering van Scopa (die Staande Komitee oor  Openbare
       Rekeninge);
  (2) kennis neem dat twee  belangrike  lede  reeds  moes  bedank,  naamlik
       Andrew Feinstein, die  ANC  se  woordvoerder,  en  Gavin  Woods,  die
       voorsitter van die komitee, omdat die ANC-lede van  die  komitee  die
       effektiewe funksionering van die komitee erg benadeel;


  (3) kennis neem dat Gavin Woods sÃª: ``Parliament has failed the people'',
       en dat die gesamentlike ondersoekspan na  die  wapentransaksie  (JIT)
       nie geregtigheid laat geskied het nie; en


  (4) die ANC versoek om nie 'n ``puppet''-voorsitter aan te wys nie en  om
       nie verder die effektiewe funksionering van die komitee  te  benadeel
       nie, en so die Parlement se goeie naam  verder  deur  die  modder  te
       sleep nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the  next  sitting
I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) requests the ANC Government to  give  serious  consideration  to  the
       effective functioning of SCOPA  (the  Standing  Committee  on  Public
       Accounts);


  (2) notes that two important members have  now  already  had  to  resign,
       namely Andrew Feinstein, the ANC's spokesperson, and Gavin Woods, the
       chairperson  of  the  committee,  because  the  ANC  members  of  the
       committee   are   seriously   harming   the   committee's   effective
       functioning;


  (3) notes that  Gavin  Woods  is  saying:  ``Parliament  has  failed  the
       people'', and  that  the  joint  investigation  team  into  the  arms
       transaction (JIT) did not let justice prevail; and


  (4) requests the ANC not to appoint  a  puppet  chairperson  and  not  to
       prejudice any further the effective  functioning  of  the  committee,
       thereby dragging Parliament's good name further through the mud.]

                  FLIGHT CAPTAINS ON SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS

                             (Draft Resolution)
Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with extreme concern for the safety of passengers and crew that
       South African Airways -


       (a)  is considering taking on entry-level pilots as flight captains;


       (b)  pilots normally first serve a copilot apprenticeship of  between
           13 and 17 years before graduating to flight captains and do  not
           become flight captains on entry level; and


       (c)  is also threatening to enforce early retirement for  any  pilot
           who reaches the age of 50 or who is older than 50; and


  (2) requests the Minister of Transport to take  the  necessary  steps  to
       ensure that South African Airways does not -


       (a)  compromise the safety of its passengers  and  crew  by  allowing
           entry-level pilots  to  become  flight  captains  without  first
           serving a copilot apprenticeship for a reasonable period; and


       (c)  force experienced and senior pilots to retire  on  reaching  the
           age of 50.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Is  there  any
objection to the motion?

Mr M A SULLIMAN: I object to the motion, Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  In  the  light
of the objection, the motion may not be proceeded with. The  motion  without
notice will now become notice of a motion.

                      GOOD WISHES TO MARK SHUTTLEWORTH

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) wishes our fellow South  African,  Mark  Shuttleworth,  who  is  also
       fondly known among South Africans as ``Boeranof'', well in his  final
       preparations toward countdown for the epic and adventurous voyage  he
       will soon  be  taking  into  outer  space  with  his  fellow  Russian
       astronauts and travel companions;


  (2) salutes his pioneering spirit, which does us proud; and


  (3) will be applauding him at that final moment of liftoff.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            DEFEAT OF SA PROTEAS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with utter disappointment the abysmal  performance  of  the  SA
       Proteas against the touring Australians in  the  first  cricket  test
       match just completed at the Wanderers in Johannesburg;


  (2) further notes that this fourth continuous defeat of the  SA  national
       cricket XI at the hands of the Aussies from  Down  Under  is  hurting
       every South African lover of sport; and


  (3) expresses the hope and optimism that hopefully the  national  cricket
       team has reached its nadir, and will rise like  a  phoenix  from  the
       ashes  of  ignominious  defeat  to  become  a  formidable  force   in
       international cricket once again and reclaim its  status  with  grit,
       determination, passion and a sense of national pride.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that the SA Police Service on the South Coast of  KwaZulu-
       Natal last week arrested seven men,  recovered  19  stolen  vehicles,
       seized four firearms and recovered stolen goods  worth  thousands  of

                   RAPE SELF-DEFENCE PROGRAMME AT SCHOOLS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J HORNE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Minister of Education and his department,  as  well
       as the private sector, for having joined forces  to  launch  a  self-
       defence programme at schools in response to the shockingly high  rape
       statistics;


  (2) notes that according to Rape Crisis a woman is raped every 23 seconds
       in the country and that according to a study carried  out  by  Unisa,
       based on police information, a million women and children  are  raped
       annually; and


  (3) calls upon all schoolgirls in the country to actively participate  in
       the  self-defence  programmes,  which  will  provide  them  with  the
       necessary tools to protect themselves against would-be attackers  and
       rapists.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                BIRTHS AND DEATHS REGISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  I  take  this
opportunity to welcome the hon Dr M G Buthelezi, Minister of  Home  Affairs,
to the NCOP and accordingly ...

... sicele inkosi ukuthi ikhulume nathi. [...  we  would  like  to  ask  the
inkosi to speak to us.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Mhlonishwa Sihlalo ohloniphekileyo, malungu  a
hloniphekileyo ... [Hon Chairperson, hon members ...]

... it is always a very great privilege to be  in  this  House  for  reasons
which I have stated and restated whenever I have been here. I am here  today
to state that the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act  108  of
1996, ushered in a new dispensation in the constitutional  history  of  this
country. Of utmost significance is the provision that  the  Constitution  is
the supreme law of the Republic.  Therefore,  law  or  conduct  inconsistent
with it is invalid and obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled.

The Department of Home Affairs, in its attempt to realign legislation  under
its administration in line with the Constitution, has identified the  Births
and Deaths Registration Act as falling into that category of legislation  in
need of  minor  adjustments  in  line  with  the  Bill  of  Rights  and  the
democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom  enshrined  in  our
Constitution.

The Births and Deaths Registration Act, Act  51  of  1992,  was  enacted  to
regulate the registration of births and deaths in the country. In  spite  of
its  being  enacted  before  the  1994  constitutional   dispensation,   the
amendments already effected to the principal Act did not cover  all  aspects
brought about by the new dispensation.

In terms, therefore, of section 28, subsection  3  of  the  Constitution,  a
child is defined as ``a  person  under  the  age  of  18  years'',  and  the
definition of a major, provided for  in  terms  of  the  Births  and  Deaths
Registration Act, has to be amended  to  be  in  line  with  the  definition
provided  by  the  Constitution.  Section  1  of  the  Births   and   Deaths
Registration Act defined a major or a person of age as any  person  who  has
attained the age of 21 years, or who is, under the provisions of  section  2
of the Age of Majority Act, Act 57 of 1972, declared to be a major,  and  it
includes a person under the age of 21  years  who  has  contracted  a  legal
marriage, whereas a minor or a minor person is defined as any person who  is
not a major or a person of age.

In line with the equality clause set out in section 9 of  the  Constitution,
it is deemed expedient that parents of children born during the  subsistence
of a marriage should be allowed to jointly decide to  raise  their  children
under the surname of either the father or the mother, or  under  both  their
surnames joined together as a double-barrelled surname.

Section 9 of the Constitution entrenches the right of all South Africans  to
be equal before the law, and to have equal protection  and  benefit  of  the
law. The  state  is  enjoined  not  to  unfairly  discriminate  directly  or
indirectly against anyone on the grounds of gender or sex. An  amendment  of
section 9 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act is viewed in  this  line
so as to afford both parents equal treatment and benefit of the law.

In the same vein, a widow had to be allowed  to  also  add  to  the  surname
which she assumed after the marriage, any  surname  that  she  bore  at  any
prior time. An amendment of section 26 of the Act is therefore necessary  to
afford a widow the same benefits as married or divorced women.

In terms of section 25(1)(b) and (c) of the Births and  Deaths  Registration
Act, the consent of the natural father of a child born  out  of  wedlock  is
required when an application for an alteration of the surname of a minor  is
contemplated. This requirement was  introduced  in  1997  when  the  Natural
Fathers of Children Born out of Wedlock Act, Act 86 of  1997,  was  enacted.
An opportunity was lost then to introduce a well-known common-law  principle
that such consent is unnecessary  if  the  mother  of  the  child  has  sole
guardianship.

The amendment  of  section  25(1)(b)  and  (c)  of  the  Births  and  Deaths
Registration Act is to introduce this well-known common-law  principle  that
where the mother or father has sole guardianship of the child,  the  consent
of the other parent is not required in  dealing  with  the  affairs  of  the
child.

Last but not least, a competent court, as referred to  in  section  25(1)(b)
and (c), is not defined in terms of section  1  of  the  Births  and  Deaths
Registration Act. In the absence of such a definition, the  jurisdiction  of
the Magistrates or Children's Act to adjudicate  on  matters  affecting  the
interests of the child as contemplated in terms of section 25(1)(b) and  (c)
of the Act is excluded as all questions pertaining  to  the  status  of  the
person must always be referred to the High Court.

With the legal costs and complications involved when the matter  has  to  be
brought before the High Court, it is necessary to define a  competent  court
so as to extend the jurisdiction to lower courts  which  are  accessible  to
the people on the ground.

With those few words I humbly request that this House accept the Births  and
Deaths Registration Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, the hon the Minister raised a  number  of  issues
that I had planned to raise as well, but we  had  not  conferred  with  each
other before this  sitting.  But  the  Minister  and  the  Chairperson  have
indicated on a number of occasions that the reason why we  have  debates  is
to inform the public out there and the people that we  are  supposed  to  be
representing on legislation and what exactly it  means  to  them,  so  I  am
going to say what I intended to say anyway.

It is once more a pleasure and privilege to address  this  honourable  House
at this, the third sitting of the  third  legislative  year  of  the  second
Parliament of the democratic Republic of  South  Africa.  We  are  about  to
enter the month  of  March,  which  has  been  identified  by  the  hon  the
President as the month in which to celebrate or highlight the  human  rights
of all South Africans.

The right to choose is probably one of the  most  fundamental  human  rights
that any human being should be able to enjoy. Section 9 (3) of the  Bill  of
Rights reads as follows, and the hon the Minister  made  reference  to  this
Section of the Constitution:


  The state may not unfairly discriminate directly  or  indirectly  against
  anyone on one or more grounds, including race,  gender,  sex,  pregnancy,
  marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age,
  disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth.

Out of all these I want to highlight three and these  are  gender,  sex  and
marital status. The hon the Minister has also dealt with  this  sufficiently
and therefore I will not go into the details. The Promotion of Equality  and
Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, Act No 4 of 2000 which  was  passed
in February of the year 2000, expands on and substantiates even  more  these
mentioned grounds of nondiscrimination.

In Chapter 5 of that  Act,  a  distinct  responsibility  is  placed  on  the
Government and its institutions to promote equality and  to  prevent  unfair
discrimination on the grounds that I have just mentioned.

The Bill before us allows for the following.  Firstly,  it  allows  for  the
inclusion of the definition of ``competent court'',  which  now  includes  a
magistrates' court and a children's court, as well as the redefinition of  a
major, or a person of age, as such a person is commonly known, from the  age
of 21 to 18. These two amendments are proposed to bring this  Bill  in  line
with current legislation around child care as well as section 28(3)  of  the
Constitution. This is in clause 1 of the amending Bill.

Secondly, it provides for the reregistration of a child in  the  surname  of
either or both of the parents. I refer  hon  members  to  clause  2  of  the
amending Bill, to which the Minister has also alluded.

Thirdly, it provides for the regulation of the alteration of the surname  of
a minor, in clause 3. Lastly, it provides for a widow to assume  a  previous
surname - that is in clause 4 of the amending Bill - which means that  if  a
woman was married, and she had assumed the surname of her husband,  she  can
then revert back to her so-called maiden name if she so wishes.

In conclusion, I want to remind the House that this  democracy  of  ours  is
eight years old, but we have moved a long way  in  deepening  it,  and  many
countries across the world attest to this. Our  Constitution,  policies  and
subsequent legislation are rated amongst the best in  the  world.  The  best
way in which we can honour this Constitution of ours is to give life to  it,
and the best way to give life to it is to practise what  we  have  committed
ourselves to doing.

In the front line of service delivery are our civil servants. They  are  the
ones who are expected to give life to the Constitution and all laws  flowing
from it. The Department of Home Affairs must therefore embark on  a  process
whereby  its  employees  are  informed  and  trained  on  all  policies  and
legislation that pass through Parliament for implementation by themselves.

We  can  all  relate  personal  stories  about  our  experiences  with   the
Department of Home Affairs over many years. Many a time people claim not  to
have known, and therefore I am making the point that the onus  rests  on  us
to ensure that the people that are in the  front  line  of  delivery  should
know what we have decided, what we  have  legislated  on  and  how  it  will
impact on the lives of people.

In our deliberations and interaction with the  department  on  this  Bill  I
have  related  experiences  of  both  myself  and  constituents  that   have
interacted with the department. These experiences  resulted  from  the  fact
that employees were not aware that certain  laws  had  been  amended  and/or
repealed.

Our democracy is growing up. We cannot claim to be in our infancy any  more.
Our hon President has set the tone when it  comes  to  service  delivery.  I
quote from what he said:


  ... we will strive to give real meaning to the strategic challenge facing
  the Public Service, Batho Pele! This spirit of service to society ...  is
  what guides us as we pursue the restructuring of the Public Service.

I want to add to that also ``the pursuance of democracy''.

With these few words I place before this House the  committee  report  which
proposes the adoption of this amending Bill, B53 of 2001. [Applause.]

Mnr J HORNE: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister en lede van  die  Huis,  Suid-
Afrika het 'n jong Grondwet waarvan die  hele  inhoud  gebaseer  is  op  die
demokrasie. Dit mag soms nodig wees om bestaande wetgewing  uit  die  vorige
bedeling in lyn te bring met die Grondwet. Hierdie  wetgewing  waaroor  daar
vandag debat gevoer word, is 'n uitvloeisel daarvan.

Artikel 1 van die Wet ondergaan maar net 'n  administratiewe  aanpassing  en
daarom is repliek daarop nie nodig nie, want dit is net  die  ouderdomsgrens
wat verander van 21 jaar na 18 jaar.

Die wysiging van artikel 9 van die Wet bepaal dat die kind se van  onder  Ã²f
die van van die vader Ã²f die  van  die  moeder  geregistreer  kan  word,  of
gesamentlik onder beide ouers se vanne. Wat dit aanbetref  is  daar  tog  'n
mate van kommer, alhoewel daar verskillende standpunte  mag  wees,  dat  dit
verwarring mag veroorsaak. Dit is oor die eeue heen simbolies in 'n  huwelik
dat die vrou en kinders die vader se van aanneem. Nou word die wese van  die
simboliek aangetas. Dit blyk tog aan die einde van die  dag  dan  seker  die
paartjie se keuse te wees.

Artikel 25 van  die  Wet  word  gewysig  om  te  bepaal  dat  die  vader  se
toestemming in geen opsig nodig is as die moeder deur 'n  hof  volle  toesig
oor die kinders ontvang het nie. In 'n regstaat  soos  Suid-Afrika  mag  dit
wetteregterlik reg wees, maar hierdie kinders moet tog in vrede en  harmonie
grootword. As die beeld van die vader versteur word, loop  die  kind  gevaar
om ongebalanseerd die lewe in te gaan, wat tog riskant is. Die  praktyk  het
keer op keer bewys  gelewer  dat  'n  kind  wat  vaderskap  ontbeer  letsels
daarvan oorhou.

Ten slotte, die wysiging van artikel 26 van die Wet beteken dat  'n  weduwee
ook haar van kan  verander.  Dat  dit  verwarring  onder  haar  kinders  kan
veroorsaak, is 'n ope vraag.

Aan die ander kant sÃª die Bybel dat daar sewe broers was. Die  eerste  broer
het getrou en gesterf. Daarna het die ander ses  broers  ook  met  die  vrou
getrou en hulle het ook gesterf. Die vrou het  toe  gesterf.  Die  dissipels
het vir Jesus gevra aan wie die vrou sou  behoort  as  hulle  almal  in  die
hemel sou kom. Jesus het hulle geantwoord dat sy  aan  niemand  sou  behoort
nie, want in die hemel sal ons almal hemelinge wees.

Artikel 26 het seker dieselfde bedoeling.

Nieteenstaande ons kommer en die verwarring  wat  dit  in  die  praktyk  sal
meebring, steun die Nuwe NP die wetgewing om dit in lyn  te  bring  met  ons
Grondwet. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and members of  the  House,  South
Africa has a young Constitution, the whole content  of  which  is  based  on
democracy. It may, at times, be  necessary  to  bring  existing  legislation
from  the  previous  dispensation  in  line  with  the   Constitution.   The
legislation that is being debated today is in consequence of this fact.

Section 1 of the Act will merely undergo an  administrative  adjustment  and
comment upon it is therefore unnecessary, as it is just the age limit  which
changes from 21 years to 18 years.

The amendment of section 9 of the Act provides that a  child's  surname  may
be registered under either that of the father, or of the mother, or  jointly
under both parents' surnames. In this regard there  still  is  a  degree  of
concern, although there may be varying points of view, that this may  create
confusion. For centuries it has been symbolic in a  marriage  for  the  wife
and children to  adopt  the  father's  surname.  Now  the  essence  of  that
symbolism is being tampered with. At the end of the day  it  is  surely  the
couple's decision.

Section 25 of the Act is amended in  order  to  provide  that  the  father's
consent is in no way needed when the mother has been  granted  full  custody
by a court. In a constitutional state such  as  South  Africa  this  may  be
statutorily correct, but these children must surely grow  up  in  peace  and
harmony. If the father's image is distorted, the child will be in danger  of
beginning life in an unbalanced way, which after all  is  risky.  In  actual
practice it has been proven time and again that a child in want of a  father
will bear consequential scars.

Finally, the amendment of section 26 of the Act means that a widow can  also
change her name. Whether this may create confusion among her children is  an
open question.

On the other hand, the Bible says that there were seven brothers. The  first
brother got married and then died. Afterwards the other  six  brothers  also
married this woman and they also died. Then  the  woman  herself  died.  The
disciples then asked Jesus to whom this woman would belong if they all  went
to heaven. However, according to Jesus' answer she will  belong  to  nobody,
because there we will all be denizens of heaven.

I suppose section 26 has the same intent.

Irrespective of  our  concerns  and  the  confusion  it  will  bring  on  in
practice, the New NP supports this legislation in order to bring it in  line
with our Constitution. [Applause.]]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Mr Chairperson, hon  Prince  of  KwaPhindangene,  Dr  M  G
Buthelezi,  the  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  and  hon   members,   let   me
congratulate the Minister and his department on the Bill  which  is  on  the
Table. Let me also congratulate the chairperson of  the  committee,  Miss  L
Jacobus, on a job well done, as the Bill ended up getting support  from  all
parties serving in the committee. We, the IFP, fully support this Bill.

Firstly, the amendment of section 9 of Act 51 of 1992 as amended by  section
4 of Act 41 of 1995 and section 1 of  Act  43  of  1998,  which  deals  with
notices of births and deaths, states that, and I quote:


  ... the notice of birth ... shall be given under the  surname  of  either
  the father or the mother of the child concerned or the surnames  of  both
  the father and mother joined together as a double barrelled surname.

Secondly, this Bill gives freedom of choice to a child born out  of  wedlock
to easily alter a surname and assume a surname of his or  her  choice.  This
Bill, in its wide scope of freedom of choice, allows a  widow  to  assume  a
previous surname if she so wishes. This, indeed, is democracy  in  the  true
sense of the word.

Mphathisihlalo,  kuyangithokozisa  mina  ukukhuluma  kulo  mThethosivivinywa
ochibiyelayo  osezithebeni.  Lo   mThethosivivinywa   ukhuluma   ngokwaziswa
kokuzalwa nokufa. Sonke siyazi  ukuthi  uma  kuzelwe  umntwana  kushicilelwa
emabhukwini  omthetho,  kutholakale  isitifiketi  sokuzalwa.  Kunjalo   noma
umuntu   ehamba   emhlabeni,   kuyaziswa   emabhukwini   omthetho,   kuphume
isitifiketi sokufa.

Engiqonde ukukusho lapha ngukuthi lo mThetho uchibiyela  emidala  ebisebenza
ibuye  ichibiyelwe  nayo  -  empeleni  lona  uchibiyela  umThetho  ka  1992.
Okusemqoka nokuhle  ngawo  ngukuthi  unika  inkululeko  ethe  xaxa  kubazali
bomntwana kanye nakumntwana ozelwe ekhaya. Uma kukhishwa  isaziso  sokuzalwa
ingane ezelweyo ingabhalwa ngonina noma ngoyise, noma  kungabhalwa  izibongo
ezimbili  esikababa  nesikamama.  Kanti-ke  umntwana  uma  esekhulile   naye
unelungelo lokuzikhethela isibongo athanda ukubizwa ngaso.

Siyayazi inkinga ebibakhona uma ingane ebizalelwe ekhaya, hhayi  emshadweni,
isifuna isibongo sayo. Bekuba umzukuzuku iphuma  ingena  ifuna  uyise  ukuba
ayisize ishintshe isibongo sakomalume, ekhaya komame phela.

Kulo mThethosivivinywa esiphezu kwawo, akusekho konke  lokho.  Umntwana  uma
esekhulile eseneminyaka engaphezu kuka-18 uyakwazi  ukuzishitshela  isibongo
azibize  ngaleso  asithandayo  kwezabazali  bakhe,   ngaphandle   kwenkinga.
Kanjalo nakubafelokazi, ikhona  inkululeko  ngoba  umfelokazi  uma  ethanda,
uzokwazi ukubuyela esibongweni sakhe sokuzalwa ngaphandle kwenkinga.

Lo mThethosivivinywa ochibiyelayo muhle kakhulu, siyawuvuma sonke. Thina be-
IFP  siwushayela  ihlombe.  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of   Zulu   paragraphs

[Chairperson, it is a pleasure for me to talk about this amending Bill  that
we are discussing here. This Bill talks about giving notice  of  births  and
deaths. We all know that if a child is born, it should  be  recorded  in  an
official register, and a child should get a birth  certificate.  It  is  the
same when a person dies. His death is registered and a death certificate  is
issued.

What I am trying to say is that this Bill amends the  previous  ones,  which
were used and amended. In fact, this one amends the Act  of  1992.  What  is
good and important about it is that it gives more  freedom  to  the  parents
when a child is born at home. When notice of a birth is given, a  child  can
be included in the record under a father's or  a  mother's  name.  Even  two
surnames, the father's and the mother's,  can  be  recorded.  And  when  the
child is grown up, he or she has a choice of adopting a surname that  he  or
she likes.

We know of the problems that emerge when a child is  born  out  of  wedlock.
The child would want its surname. It used to be hard  for  a  child  looking
for a father so that  he  could  help  him  or  her  change  their  mother's
surname.

We will never experience that scenario as far as  this  Bill  is  concerned.
When a child is over 18, he will be able to change  his  surname  and  adopt
the one he likes without any problem. This applies to widows too.  There  is
freedom, because if a widow likes, she will be able to take back her  maiden
surname without any hitch.

This amending Bill is very good, and  we  all  accept  it.  We  in  the  IFP
applaud it. [Applause.]]

Ms E C GOUWS: Mr Chairperson, I thank you for this opportunity. But  I  wish
I could have had six minutes when I spoke in the Presidential  debate  or  a
Health debate because there is  always  much  to  say  about  HIV/Aids.  Six
minutes for the Births and Deaths  Registration  Amendment  Bill  is  rather
generous.

The Bill seeks to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act of  1992,  so
as to define an expression; to reduce the age of majority;  to  provide  for
the registration of a child in the surname of either  or  both  parents;  to
further regulate the alteration of the surname of a minor; and  to  allow  a
widow to assume a previous surname; and to  provide  for  matters  connected
therewith.
Ons by die DP verwelkom hierdie reg van die individu om self te besluit  oor
sy naam of van waarmee hy deur die lewe wil gaan. In my eie  geval,  sou  ek
hierdie geleentheid gehad het, sou ek al op  hoÃ«rskool  ontslae  geraak  het
van die Claassens deel van my naam en  dit  nogal  na  'n  heel  aanvaarbare
Embrensia. Ek was baie kere baie verleÃ« as  ek  my  naam  hardop  moes  gee.
Kinders in daardie jare was duiwels en in daardie jare was  'n  van  vir  'n
familienaam, veral vir 'n dogter, 'n saak waarmee gespot is.

Dit sal nou natuurlik vir die familienavorsers moeilik wees om die  stambome
van families op te  spoor.  Daar  sal  ongetwyfeld  families  wees  wat  nie
hiermee genoeÃ« neem nie, want vir hulle is 'n van van  kardinale  belang  om
elke moontlike voorvader of -moeder op te spoor met 'n  trotse  familienaam.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We in the DP welcome this right of the individual to decide for himself  or
herself about the name or surname with which he or she wants to  go  through
life. As far as I am concerned, if I had had this opportunity I  would  have
dropped the Claassens part of my name, and that  after  a  quite  acceptable
Embrensia, as long ago as at high school. There were many times when  I  was
embarrassed if I had to say my name aloud.  In  those  years  children  were
veritable devils and in those years a surname as a family  name,  especially
for a girl, was something to be ridiculed.

It will now, of course, be difficult for the  family  researchers  to  trace
the genealogical trees of families. There will undoubtedly be some  families
that will not be pleased with this, because for them a  surname  is  of  the
utmost importance to trace every possible  ancestor  or  ancestress  with  a
proud family name.]

One of my colleagues in the DP has already taken  the  opportunity  -  maybe
the first in Parliament - to do this. The colleague married  a  Miss  Stokes
and then he added his wife's surname to his. My colleague is Nick  Clelland-
Stokes. [Applause.]

When the DP support, they support  in  style.  The  DP  supports  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon House, I  have  chosen
to deal with the clauses of this Bill  randomly  as  the  spirit  moves  me,
rather than in any chronological order. [Laughter.]
Section 9 of the principal Act is amended in order to  make  provision  that
parents of children born during the existence of a marriage  be  allowed  to
register their children under the  surname  of  either  the  father  or  the
mother or under both their surnames joined together  as  a  double-barrelled
surname.

I am not a student  of  anthropology,  nor  am  I  well-versed  in  cultural
beliefs and customs of our people, but what I do know is that a  child  born
of a Mokwena man would belong to the Bakwena clan, that is, ``the people  of
the crocodiles'', and  would  assume  a  crocodile  as  his  or  her  totem.
[Laughter.] If he or she were to be registered  under  the  surname  of  the
mother who, for argument's sake would be a Monogeng, that  is,  ``people  of
the snakes'', then he or she would be regarded as having  lost  his  or  her
affinity to the people of the crocodiles,  that  is  the  Bakwena  clan,  to
which he or she biologically belongs.

I am aware that at the committee level I had voted in support of  the  Bill,
but I regret that today I should withdraw  my  support  on  account  of  the
above-mentioned cultural impediment. [Applause.]

Ms S N NTLABATI: Just as Mrs Gouws  said  ...  I  ask  for  your  protection
please, Mr  Chairperson,  from  Shenge.  Mrs  Gouws  said  six  minutes  was
generous. Worse than that is eight. Everybody  has  said  almost  everything
there is to say, but, anyhow, I would say that this piece of legislation  is
a cry of ``Viva'' to women, thanks to you mntwana, thanks  to  you,  Shenge.
But, it does represent a challenge as to how many people outside  will  know
about it. So, the challenge to all of us who are here is to educate,  as  we
go out, the  beneficiaries  of  this  piece  of  legislation,  which  is  an
amendment of a lifetime solution to many women's problems.

I notice the  progressiveness  of  the  piece  of  legislation  because,  of
course, it brings down, from 21 to 18 years the age of majority. The  social
environment of children today makes them more mature, even from 15 years  of
age. At least, this is a most notable thing to me.

Lastly, I would say that the indignity of women having to go around  looking
for the natural father when they want to go to these offices is no  more.  I
must say that, unlike Ntate Tlhagale,  who  did  not  say  anything  at  the
committee meetings, I did warn, at committee level, of the cultural  issues.
I asked about double-barrelled or triple-barrelled  surnames,  and  whether,
when it goes down the line, it would not take us even up to  four  surnames.
The last thing I said is that  I  want  to  ask  the  elderly  people  their
opinion, because in our culture we usually say that when a child  cries  and
cries endlessly, one has got  to  look  for  that  family.  Ke  Bakoena,  ke
Bataung, ke  eng  [There  are  Bakoenas,  the  Bataungs  or  whatever].  But
somewhere down the line I am not sure if, 50 years from now,  we  are  going
to know what to do. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  I  was  not  actually
surprised to see Mr Tlhagale still holding on to the culture.  I  still  see
him in a Bophuthatswana tie. I am  sure  he  still  holds  to  the  culture.
[Interjections.] Maybe the hon the Minister  will  be  able  to  answer  the
Bakoena issue.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, I think all that is left  for  me
to do is to  thank  the  chairperson  of  the  Select  Committee  on  Social
Services, Ms Jacobus, for the support she has given to the  Bill,  and  also
for her emphasis, which is similar to that of Ms Ntlabati just now,  on  the
obligation we have, as members of Parliament, to remind our people of  their
rights under the Constitution, because all  that  the  legislation  does  is
remind us, as  the  population,  of  the  rights  that  we  have  under  our
Constitution.

All members of the House have emphasised the beauty of the  choice  that  is
given by the Constitution. Mr Horne did, and I also  enjoyed  him  referring
us to the question that Christ  gave,  about  that  widow,  but  of  course,
Christ was talking about the hereafter, not about this world. He said  that,
in the hereafter, there is no such thing as marriage or married people,  but
I really admire, as a Christian, that this House has  good  Christians  like
Mr Horne.

I also thank Mrs Vilakazi for saying the  obvious,  that  of  course  as  we
enter this world our entry is recorded as much  as  when  we  exit  to  join
those who are in eternity. That fact is also recorded.

I thank all members of this House because  all  supported  the  Bill,  apart
from Mr Tlhagale, who withdrew support on cultural grounds, because he  says
that one must make a  distinction  between  crocodiles  and  snakes.  I  can
appreciate his  dilemma.  As  a  traditional  leader  I  do  understand  his
dilemma, because in terms of our culture these things  are  very  important.
Therefore  I  can  understand  his  confusion  because  it  is  a  duty   of
traditional leaders to uphold the customs and traditions of the  people.  So
although, as a Minister, I would like to  argue  against  him,  I  am  in  a
dilemma because as a traditional leader it is my duty to uphold the  customs
and cultures of my people.

On the whole I must say I am most grateful to hon members of this House  for
making my work so simple, because there are no queries that they have  posed
which need my elucidation or any amplification. As I always  say,  when  one
is in this House one is always impressed by the dignity  with  which  people
express their views and the whole atmosphere. One  really  feels  kuseNdlini
yeziNgwevu [in the NCOP] when one is in this House. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 14:44.
