                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms S P RWEXANA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Cape Town lacked good governance and  abandoned  the  poor
       under the DA's mayor, Gerald Morkel;


  (2) further notes that the new mayor, Nomaindia Mfeketo, has announced -


       (a)  the fast-tracking of the development of District Six;


       (b)  the extension of closed  circuit  television  cameras  to  crime
           hotspots on the Cape Flats; and


       (c)  a moratorium on all evictions and water cut-offs;


  (3) believes that the mayorship under the ANC/New  NP  co-operation  will
       strive for equitable, efficient and effective  service  delivery  and
       will contribute to poverty alleviation and job creation; and


  (4) congratulates Mayor Nomaindia Mfeketo on her election as Mayor of the
       unicity of Cape Town.

[Applause.]

Mr C M LOWE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay that the comments made by  Deputy  Minister  Pahad,
       which cast doubt upon the peer review mechanism of the African Union,
       and which astounded and disturbed  international  opinion,  have  now
       been endorsed by President Mbeki;
  (2) further notes that Deputy President Zuma and President  Mbeki  appear
       to have conflicting views on the matter, in that the Deputy President
       stated in the House yesterday  that  the  Deputy  Minister  had  been
       misunderstood;


  (3) resolves that the President and Deputy President, together  with  the
       Deputy Minister, should decide  which  view  was  correct  since  the
       future of Nepad largely depends on projecting both to Africa  and  to
       donor  countries  that  peer  review  of  political   governance   is
       essential.

[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock that nine foreign tourists were killed and a further
       10 passengers injured when their tour bus was involved in an accident
       between Piet Retief and Pongola in Mpumalanga on 30 October 2002;


  (2) conveys its sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased;


  (3) wishes the injured a speedy and full recovery; and


  (4) urges the relevant national and provincial transport  authorities  to
       vigorously investigate  the  causes  of  the  accident  and  to  take
       whatever appropriate remedial action is required.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr C H F GREYLING:  Voorsitter,  hiermee  gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting van die Huis, namens die Nuwe NP, sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van 'n mediaverklaring wat  mnr  Charles  Redcliffe,  LP,
       vandag uitgereik het, waarin hy sê dat hy, ten spyte van die verwagte
       oorloopwetgewing, 'n lid van die Nuwe NP bly en sy termyn tot en  met
       die volgende verkiesing en daarna in die Nuwe NP wil uitdien;


  (2) verder kennis neem van die redes vir sy besluit, naamlik-


       (a)  die eerbare wyse waarop leier van die Nuwe NP, mnr Marthinus van
           Schalkwyk, teenoor hom  opgetree  en  sy  ondernemings  aan  hom
           gestand gedoen het;


       (b)  die algehele gebrek  aan  leierskap  in  die  DP/DA,  veral  ten
           opsigte van hule optrede teenoor lede in a Wetgewer van  KwaZul-
           Natal en raadslede in die Wes-Kaap wat wou oorloop; en


       (c)  dat die Nuwe NP die beste tuiste vir hom is  om  sy  kiesers  te
           dien en 'n positiewe bydrae te lewer; en


  (3) Mnr Redcliffe gelukwens met sy weldeurdagte besluit.

(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C H F GREYLING: Chairperson, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:

  That the House -


  (1) notes a media statement issued today by Mr Charles Redcliffe  MP,  in
       which he states that he,  the  expected  crossover  legislation  not
       withstanding, remains a member of the New NP and wants to serve  his
       term in the New NP up to the next elections and thereafter;


  (2) further notes the reasons for his decision, namely -


       (a)  the honourable manner in which the New NP leader, Marthinus van
             Schalkwyk, acted towards him and honoured his agreement;


       (b)  the total lack of leadership  in  the  DP/DA,  especially  with
             regard to their conduct towards  the  members  in  the  KwaZulu
             Natal legislature and councillors in the Western  Cape  wanting
             to cross over; and


       (c)  that the New NP is the best home for him from  which  to  serve
             his voters and make a positive contribution; and


   (3)      congratulates Mr Redcliffe on his well-considered decision.]
[Applause.]

Mr D G MKONO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the UDM yesterday won two by-elections against the ANC  in
       the KSD Municipality,  and  that  this  therefore  remains  the  only
       municipality  in  the  Eastern  Cape  that  is  controlled   by   the
       opposition;


  (2) further notes that the UDM scored this  significant  victory  in  the
       ANC's heartland,  despite  various  dirty  trick  campaigns  and  the
       deployment of senior ANC leaders to the area;


  (3) acknowledges that these first by-elections after  the  floor-crossing
       period underscore the UDM's warning to the ANC that the  voters  will
       have the last say, a fact that is further emphasised by the  300  ANC
       branch members from Engcobo who recently joined the UDM;


  (4) recognises that this confirms that the UDM  is  taking  support  away
       from  the  ANC,  whose  service  delivery  record  and  opportunistic
       politics of expediency disgust the voters; and


   (5)      thanks the voters for giving the UDM a renewed mandate.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms J CHALMERS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the focus theme of this month is the rights of the child;


  (2) further notes that the Department of  Social  Development  is  making
       proposals which will  assist  in  reducing  the  number  of  children
       awaiting trial in adult facilities and that these proposals entail -


       (a)  an expansion of diversion programmes and  community-based  house
           arrest programmes;


       (b)  increasing the number of secure  care  facilities  and  one-stop
           justice centres; and


       (c)  the prioritisation of children's cases in court, the improvement
           of legal representation for children and probation services;


  (3) believes that  these  proposals  will  facilitate  rehabilitation  of
       children who transgress the law; and


  (4) welcomes  the  proposals  made  by  the  department,  as  these  will
       contribute to bringing down the levels of crime.

[Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) strongly condemns the cowardly acts of terrorism committed in Gauteng
       in the early hours of Wednesday morning, when a series of bombs  were
       detonated;


  (2) believes that anyone who preys on our defenceless civilian population
       in such a manner should be dealt with swiftly and most severely;


  (3) further believes that acts of terrorism that  lead  to  the  loss  of
       innocent life deserve the death sentence;


  (4) extends our condolences to the families of the deceased and wishes  a
       speedy recovery to all those injured in the blasts;


  (5) calls on the police to leave no stone unturned in  their  search  for
       the perpetrators of the bombings;


  (6) further calls upon Government to -


       (a)  reinstate the death penalty in  South  Africa  as  a  matter  of
           urgency; and
  (7) appeals to the courts to ensure that the maximum  penalty  be  handed
       down on the criminals, and that they will not have access to bail  or
       parole.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) wishes to congratulate Pasma students at the University  of  Pretoria
       for  winning  five  seats  on  the  SRC,  despite  limited  financial
       resources;


  (2) observes that this victory represents a  complete  turnaround  for  a
       university that at one time was lily white, and even tarred lecturers
       who dared to suggest that blacks had a place in the sun;


  (3) observes further that PAC policy is  well-received,  particularly  by
       persons who  are  intellectually  inclined  and  understand  rational
       policies; and


  (4) calls on the South African nation to follow the example  of  Pretoria
       University, and not the jamboree of floor crossing about which it  is
       true to say, ``the more things  change,  the  more  they  remain  the
       same''.

Mr E M SIGWELA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that former President Nelson Mandela received the International
       Lenin Peace Prize from the Russian Embassy on 28 October 2002;


  (2) further notes that this peace  prize  acknowledges  former  President
       Mandela's contribution to the struggle of our people against the most
       naked  racism  ever   experienced   by   the   peoples   of   Africa,
       systematically codified, sanctified and ruthlessly implemented;


  (3) believes that this great hero of our liberation struggle  has  become
       an  icon  and  an  inspiration  for  peace,  justice,   freedom   and
       reconciliation throughout the world;


  (4) congratulates former President Mandela on receiving this peace prize.

[Applause.]

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  three ANC councillors from Dihlabeng in the Free  State  refused
           to comply with subpoenas to appear in court on charges of  fraud
           after allegedly submitting false claims for transport expenses;


       (b)  warrants have now been issued for their arrests; and


       (c)  this is causing a great deal of damage to the  municipality  and
           the Dihlabeng council; and


  (2) calls on the ANC to heed  the  DA's  calls  to  get  rid  of  corrupt
       politicians and, should their organisation  have  any  left,  replace
       them with individuals with integrity and quality.

[Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of he IFP:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) an important municipal by-election was  held  in  Alexandra,  in  the
       Johannesburg metro, Gauteng;


  (2) this election was won by the IFP against other parties like the  ANC,
       the PAC, the DA and the UDM; and


  (3) this ward was previously held by the ANC and that this  council  ward
       is now an IFP gain.

Ms S B NQODI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Department  of  Social  Development  has  successfully
       piloted the Phandulwazi Life Skills Centre in King William's Town;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  the centre's adolescent  development  programme,  the  ADP,  has
           achieved a success rate  of  approximately  80%  in  integrating
           children and youth in communties and as such diverting them from
           the criminal justice system; and


       (b)  this model has been replicated in the Eastern Cape,  North  West
           and the Northern Cape, and that it revives cultural  values  and
           addresses social challenges experienced by  children  and  young
           people, such as substance abuse and breaking up of families;


  (3) believes that these initiatives provide a framework for children  and
       youth who transgress the law to be reintegrated into society; and


  (4) welcomes the initiatives of the Department of Social Development.

       children in their cities, towns and villages.

                       ILLEGAL MARRAIGES OF FOREIGNERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the illegal marriage of foreigners to local residents  who  are
        oblivious of this union, to gain South African citizenship;


  (2) takes note of this document in my hand, which is proof  of  one  such
        incident in which a South African female became a  victim  of  such
        circumstances by marrying a foreigner that she has never  met,  the
        marriage  having  been  registered  in  a  different  town,  namely
        Pretoria;


  (3) calls on the Minister of Home Affairs to -


        (a)      urgently look into this matter and to bring  to  book  the
               person or persons concerned; and


        (b)      ensure that this illegal practice is curtailed immediately
               as many others may be affected unknowingly by this.

Agreed to.

                               CRICKET QUOTAS

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, Cabinet  colleagues,  and
hon members, in the statement to the National  Assembly  today,  I  will  be
dealing specifically with a  report  submitted  to  me  by  a  committee  of
inquiry that I appointed on 18 July to investigate the progress with  regard
to the transformation of cricket throughout the country.  Hon  members  will
be aware that the United Cricket Board  of  South  Africa  decided,  at  the
National Consideration Conference held at Kievits Kroon on 7 July, to  scrap
transformation quotas at the level of national and senior provincial  teams.


This unleashed major debates within the broader SA sports  movement  and  in
the media. The decision was in sharp contrast to a recommendation  from  the
UCB's  own  transformation  monitoring  committee,  that,  as  recently   as
February 2002, had recommended that the quota  system  for  both  provincial
and national teams  should  be  increased.  It  was  also  contrary  to  the
decision of the UCB council to review the quota system only after  the  2003
World Cup.

I was not convinced that the UCB's decision  to  scrap  its  most  effective
tool to ensure transformation  was  the  correct  one.  And  I  subsequently
decided to appoint a committee of inquiry to test the validity of the  claim
made by the UCB. Their president Adv Percy  Sonn  was  quoted  at  the  time
saying that: "We have seen enough real change to  be  confident  that  these
sides could be selected on merit, and we  have  enough  quality  players  of
colour that their presence in these senior  teams  no  longer  needs  to  be
dictated by a quota system." Ironically, it was also Adv  Sonn  of  the  UCB
who conceded at a meeting that he had not studied the reports  that  led  to
this decision being taken.

I engaged the UCB through both correspondence and meetings  on  the  matter,
culminating in a rather tense meeting attended by executive members  of  the
UCB. I made it very clear at this meeting that I was not prepared to  change
the terms of reference or the composition of the committee of inquiry.

It  was  also  here  that  I  experienced  first-hand  perception  that  the
president of the UCB appears to be a  law  unto  himself,  as  well  as  the
perception that  he  displays  a  negative  attitude.  At  the  meeting,  he
insisted that he would be the sole speaker for the UCB and that  his  entire
executive committee members would not contribute to the meeting.

Let me also use this opportunity to point out that there  exists  a  general
perception that UCBSA, under the current leadership of Adv Sonn, is  sliding
unconsciously into a situation where they are not sufficiently aware of  nor
receptive enough to the issues on the  ground,  especially  in  historically
disadvantaged areas and clubs.

The committee of inquiry  commenced  its  work  on  7  August  with  clearly
defined terms of reference. However, the UCB voiced a public view  that  the
inquiry, before it started,  was  flawed  and  was  tainted  with  bias  and
subjectivity. In a clear attack  on  the  committee,  the  UCB  stated  that
members of the public and themselves would view that report  emanating  from
the inquiry with circumspection and cynicism.

I have now taken receipt of the report and read it and invited  the  UCB  to
discuss both its release and  its  findings  with  Government.  It  is  very
unfortunate that, again, the president of the UCB has indicated that he  has
not studied the contents of the report.  But  he  is  on  public  record  as
having allegedly stated that he does not care what is  in  the  report,  and
that the UCB's decision will stand.

It is my contention that South Africans of all persuasions need to  confront
the issue of transformation in sport with open minds. We  cannot  be  silent
on the issue, no matter what views we hold. We cannot be defensive, nor  can
we perpetuate the culture of silence that pervades national  federations  on
the issue of transformation. We owe it to ourselves, to our players, and  we
owe it to our spectators and to the country to be bold in  our  approach  to
social transformation, including transformation in sport.

Transformation, as a process, refers  to  overall  national  and  provincial
politics and processes within which change in sport is unfolding.  Therefore
transformation in sport takes place within the overall framework of  ongoing
political change in our country,  and  it  is  guided  by  the  policies  of
Government.

The UCBSA does not operate outside of this political  change,  nor  does  it
operate in a vacuum. We concede that it is  an  association  of  volunteers,
but they are South African volunteers. The chief executive  officer  of  the
UCB is correct when he says that his organisation is in  charge  of  running
cricket. Very correct. His reported comments about  not  being  dictated  to
are not dissimilar to the views of those who ran  apartheid  sport,  and  he
knows what happened to them and their apartheid sport.

Transformation has not been imposed from the top on the sports  federations.
They have given their complete agreement  and  buy-in  as  to  the  absolute
necessity of the process. Very early in the life of the new  democracy,  all
the major sports federations struck a social accord of good faith  with  the
Government that they would pursue a transformation agenda, the  details  and
modalities of which would be determined by the  conditions  and  demands  of
each sporting code and federation.

At  its  heart,  transformation  is  about  change.  It  involves  personal,
institutional, attitudinal and paradigmal change. It is not about  embracing
change for the sake of it. It is not about simply substituting  white  faces
with black faces. Although there are  numerous  examples  of  work  process,
this process has indeed been reduced to this. Rather,  transformation  is  a
conscious, deliberate, planned and goal-directed  process  of  fundamentally
restructuring the very conditions  that  have,  in  the  past,  led  to  the
deliberate  exclusion  of  the  majority  of  our  people  from   meaningful
participation in sport.
As such, transformation  has  its  core  issues,  such  as  the  demographic
representativity  of  teams,  the  equitable  allocation  of  resources   to
historically excluded communities and the role of sport in  building  a  new
patriotism. Transformation also brings  with  it  uncertainty,  a  potential
loss of privilege, power and authority, and it brings with it  a  threat  to
the old way of doing things.

There are many stories in the sports world of black players not being  given
the  same  chances  to  prove  themselves  as  their   white   counterparts.
Similarly, there are accounts of players being labelled quota players  based
on their skin colour. These and other examples, that I will refer to,  point
to the fact that a key element of transformation has to do with  changes  in
attitude by those who are at the coalface of transformation.

There are many people in sport who have been unable to come  to  terms  with
the demands of the new political realities, and at some point, those  people
will have to be left behind in the interest of transformation as a whole.
The decision taken by the UCB to  do  away  the  quota  system  is  a  clear
indication that the battle for transformation is ongoing, and very very  far
from over. So too the revelations by the Springbok great, Chester  Williams,
in his biography released this week. Chester is at pains  in  this  book  to
point out that, after 10 years of playing rugby  in  South  Africa,  he  has
realised what it means to be black in  this  country.  He  argues  that  his
story is not one of an underprivileged coloured boy who made it good. It  is
of a rugby player, a young boy, who dreamed of playing for his country  once
he had had a taste of rugby. All he  ever  wanted  was  to  be  a  Springbok
player. He says all he ever was in South Africa  during  his  tenure  was  a
black rugby player.

As indicated by some cricket players, they hate the term `quota  player'  as
much as everyone else. Chester argues that  it  is  a  negative  one,  which
throughout his playing days was used exclusively to identify  black  players
in any South African team. Like  so  many  today,  Chester  states  that  he
confused the necessity and the effectiveness of the quota  system  with  the
word  quota.  It  led  him  to  denounce  the  quota  system  without   ever
appreciating the role it had played in South African  sport.  This  book  by
Chester, a biography of courage, has created a storm in the media  in  South
Africa, but the  dividing  line,  generally,  was  very  very  clear.  Black
players  supported  the  views  of  Chester  Williams,  while  others   were
defensive about Chester's claims.

I would like to present to hon  members  what  Chester  says  on  the  quota
system. I quote him:


  Quotas were brought in because of lack of opportunity for  black  players
  and since the introduction  at  senior  level,  they  have  had  positive
  results. I realise now that quotas are necessary in South African  rugby.
  Without the quota system, there would still be limited opportunities  for
  black players. Black players for the next few years will have to learn to
  deal with this and will have to focus on the positive  aspect  that  they
  now have a chance to show what good rugby players they are. If it was not
  for the quota system at provincial level, the likes  of  Breyten  Paulse,
  Bolla Conradie, Quentin Davids, Conrad Jantjes,  Adrian  Jacobs,  Ricardo
  Laubscher and Deon Kayser would not have been given  sufficient  exposure
  to prove their worth as rugby players. And what good rugby  players  they
  are. The quota system gave them a chance and that is more than  thousands
  of black players had for more than hundred years in South African rugby.

This comes from a player who suffered under the indignity of being  labelled
by other players and the media.

Another player says that now is not the right time to scrap quotas,  because
in our locations and our villages, things are still  the  same.  A  national
player said that. The second one says that he thinks  the  quota  system  is
very important for those who are coming through now, and he thinks  that  it
is very important that the quota system stays in for much longer. That is  a
provincial player saying  that.  Another  provincial  player  says  that  he
thinks there would not be any opportunity for guys  coming  through  without
the quota system.
The quota system has never been the creation  of  this  Government.  On  the
contrary, national federations themselves decided that the quota system  was
the best mechanism to achieve transformation targets. It  is  widely  argued
that  the  issue  of  quota  systems  should  be  understood  as   being   a
transformation strategy and employed to expedite and achieve  a  merit-based
demographic representation in sport.

I would like to extend a hand to  the  UCB  and  all  those  who  are  still
resisting transformation, even  those  sitting  on  our  lefthand  side  who
resist transformation and  everything  that  we  do,  to  come  forward  and
discuss their concerns, in the best interest of all sport  in  the  country.
[Interjections.] If we do not  do  this,  10  years  from  now,  as  Chester
Williams has discovered, we will come back and say that sport still  remains
untransformed.

In studying the report, which was given  to  me  by  the  committee  that  I
appointed,  there  are  more  important  points  to  note.  The  UCB's   own
transformation monitoring committee under  Professor  André  Odendaal  never
recommended to the UCB to scrap the quota  system.  On  the  contrary,  they
recommended that quotas be increased in both national and provincial  teams.
The committee also had evidence from a broad spectrum of people  that  there
was a lack of consultation which preceded the  conference  held  at  Kievits
Kroon. It was the view of most of the interviewees that they were  surprised
to learn of the decision of the UCB to scrap the quota system, and  that  it
was necessary to have canvassed the  intended  beneficiaries  of  the  UCB's
transformation programme.

Ironically, a member of the  Transformation  Monitoring  Committee  reported
that we are living in a country where  prejudices  still  exist.  He  argues
that it is therefore unreasonable to place the future of  black  players  on
the goodwill of white  administrators.  In  this  regard,  nine  out  of  11
provincial coaches in our country are white. [Interjections.]  Nine  of  the
11 provincial captains are white. Two  of  them  are  black;  one  is  Nixon
McLean of KwaZulu-Natal who is a West-Indian  player.  The  other  is  Jimmy
Adams, also a West-Indian player, from the Free State.  I  have  no  problem
against those players; they are wonderful players. But should we  not  breed
our own captains?

The recommendations  are  in  front  of  hon  members,  and  this  committee
recommends that the UCB's decision of  scrapping  transformation  quotas  at
the level of national teams was taken  without  any  consultation  and  that
this was based on inadequate assessment and consideration.  [Interjections.]
The committee recommends that the UCB, as a matter of urgency and  prior  to
the World Cup, which is coming next year  which  we  support  fully  -  this
Government has put a lot of work into that -  put  in  place  the  necessary
process  to  ensure  that  the  conference's  resolution  is  looked  at  or
recinded.  Furthermore,  the  committee  also  recommends  that  within  the
provinces where transformation has been the slowest, including  Free  State,
Gauteng, Northern Province, and provinces like Mpumalanga, where  there  are
no teams at all, the UCB should  focus  on  these  provinces  to  accelerate
transformation, and that the UCB must also create a structure through  which
focus should be placed on the development of players.

I have spoken about the Cricket World Cup which is coming and  that  all  of
us support it. We hope that, in the long run, our team will be  the  winning
team, but the UCB must also give expression  to  its  undertaking  that  our
World Cup team will include  no  fewer  than  five  or  six  black  players.
[Interjections.] Yes, those members want us to go around the  bend  on  this
thing.

I wish to invite all South Africans  to  make  use  of  the  opportunity  to
submit written views on the report to myself. I am going to release  it  now
at 15h30 to all provincial federations and to everyone who  participated.  I
do believe that there is a widespread acceptance in the  provinces  that  we
cannot have a  situation  like  the  one  which  happened  in  KwaZulu-Natal
recently where the president of  the  province  was  held  to  ransom  under
threat of resignation by his captain Dale Benkenstein, that if he  dared  to
include the young talented Goolam Bodi in  the  provincial  team,  he  would
resign. [Interjections.] Nor can we have a  situation  where  provinces  are
excluded from the consultative process  that  directly  affect  them.  I  am
particularly concerned about the situation in  the  Eastern  Province  where
the UCB stepped in as a result of a variety of problems to try and sort  out
the differences within that province. I believe a report has been  finalised
on this. In the spirit of transparency, I would like to invite  the  UCB  to
make  the  Eastern  Province  report  available  to   everybody,   including
Government.

In conclusion, my special thanks go to Ruth Bhengu  and  the  committee  for
the work that they have put in and their co-operation on this. I would  also
like special thanks  to  go  to  Mr  John  Smith,  the  chairperson  of  the
committee, who is sitting over there. He is a lawyer from East London. I  do
realise that John worked very hard under tremendous pressure.  But  together
with his team, including Ms Kedi  Tshoma,  Dr  Mtutuzeli  Nyoka,  Dr  Willie
Basson and Greg Fredericks, he has delivered a report that  will  contribute
significantly to the unfolding processes  of  transformation,  not  only  in
cricket, but in all sports in our country.

I am putting these here so that when the opposition, which does not want  to
see this kind of transformation, throws bouncers  -  I  have  a  helmet  for
those bouncers. [Interjections.] I have a vampire bat here to hit  them  for
a six. And, in any case,  they  cannot  bowl.  They  do  not  know  cricket.
[Applause.]

Adv P S SWART:  Chairperson,  the  UCB  is  one  of  the  flagships  amongst
sporting codes in terms  of  development  and  transformation,  putting  the
money where the mouths are. This year alone,  they  allocated  R134  million
for development compared to the paltry R125 000 Government grant  they  get.
I wish to tell the Minister that they are  playing  in  a  different  league
than his is.

After a self-funded two-year process of  national  transformation  seminars,
the UCB adopted a Transformation Charter and Pledge to  the  Nation  at  the
National Vision Conference in November 1998. This had  various  specific  4-
year  targets  which,  at  that  conference,  were  applauded  by  all,  ANC
included.  In  July  this  year,  they  took  stock.  Preparation  for  this
consultation conference included the tour of all the provinces  by  the  CEO
and the transformation consultant. A report of this was distributed  to  all
delegates, the majority of which were black, together with the formal  audit
from the Transformation Monitoring Committee,  of  which  the  majority  are
also black.

These reports indicate that the UCB  has  internalised  transformation,  and
apart  from  a  major  demographic  turnabout  in  the  composition  on  all
administrative levels, also achieved the  following  player  representivity:
37% on the national team; 32% on the provincial teams, exceeding the  target
of 44 by 50% with the achievement of 66; bowl level it is  46%:  the  target
44%, the achievement 100; under-19 level 51% are black players. They  had  a
target of 66, but the achievement was 76.

Now this resulted in the conference unanimously  coming  to  the  conclusion
that transformation targets have been reached, indeed exceeded, followed  by
the positive step of deciding to build from that by  using  achievements  as
benchmarks for  the  future,  with  further  transformation  through  normal
participation, not quotas, and development in particular.

Now, this should have been applauded and used as  a  positive  indicator  to
other  sporting  codes,  but  the  opposite  happened.  Why?  Because   they
committed a deadly sin in sporting circles in South Africa. These  decisions
were made public without the interference  or  sanctioning  thereof  by  the
self-proclaimed ruler of all matters concerned and relating  to  sport.  His
immediate reaction? No acknowledgements, but the appointment of a task  team
to investigate transformation in cricket.  Whatever  the  findings  of  this
task team, and I have not seen the report, this was a slap in  the  face  to
people who worked  hard  for  many  years  to  ensure  the  development  and
transformation of cricket. The Minister, adding insult to injury,  allocated
a budget of almost R750 000 to fund this, compared to that  R125  000.  This
exercise was nothing but part of the ANC's ongoing  project  to  impose  its
race-obsessed agenda on South African sport,  so  blind  that  it  fails  to
acknowledge these wonderful achievements by  the  UCB,  on  the  eve  of  us
hosting the 2003 World Cup.

I wish to tell the Minister that there  are  many  previously  disadvantaged
schools that  need  sport  equipment  for  which  he  could  have  used  the
taxpayers' money instead of funding his own political agenda.

To conclude, for the sake of sport, we can only hope that the  ANC  and  the
Minister will stop their constant interference in South  African  sport  and
rather acknowledge the development and transformation that does take  place,
which we support, whilst focusing on those that still lag  behind,  not  the
UCB.

About the report, I wished to ask the hon the  Minister  whether  he  thinks
for one moment that any report by his own hand-picked commission  will  ever
have more credibility out there in  the  real  world  than  the  conclusions
about transformation by so many  previously  disadvantaged  within  the  UCB
itself after all the hard and dedicated work. Maybe his attitudes  are  best
portrayed by his words to the CEO, Gerald Majola, at that  meeting  in  July
where the Minister accused him of being a traitor, and  I  quote:  "I  don't
want to hear excuses. I don't give a s--t." [Applause.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Chairperson and honourable comrades, let me at the  outset
state that during the days of the sport struggle  in  this  country,  during
the apartheid era, the most  famous  slogan  was  "No  normal  sport  in  an
abnormal society". I think today we should reverse that  and  say  that  "No
abnormal sport in a  normal  society",  because  what  is  happening  today,
whether we like it or not, is that  we  are  playing  abnormal  sport  in  a
normal society. If it were not so, we would not be discussing quota  systems
and all that. It is for that very  reason  that  our  sport  is  still  very
abnormal.

For indeed, though we are enjoying living in a normal society as I said,  we
have to do something about the situation of our sport  today.  If  only  our
present Government had accepted the recommendation which  was  submitted  in
1995 by the SA Sport Council, Sacos, to the effect that isolation  of  sport
in this country should remain until the fields were levelled  up,  we  would
not be discussing today. But, we compromised that on behalf of  the  players
and we allowed quota systems. I  believe  that  if  isolation  had  remained
then, we would not be talking about this. We would all be enjoying sport.  I
still believe, even now, that it  was  a  wrong  decision  to  have  allowed
international   sport   to   this   country   under    the    circumstances.
[Interjections.]

The hon member does not know about  the  ICC  policy.  He  is  just  sitting
there, and should not come and tell me about the ICC  policy.  He  does  not
know anything about it. He should not start with me.

So I am certain that had the Government accepted  this  proposal,  we  would
not be debating this, as I said. However, it is now water under the  bridge.
Some people are happy with the quota system, and some people are  not  happy
with this system. Therefore, it is the right  of  Government,  whilst  there
are still these two faces of people, to interfere whether the  other  people
like it or not. [Applause.]

I  believe  that,  in  our  days,  we  used  to  fight  the  government  for
interfering in sport. I know that. But, we had a right to do so because  our
sport was normal. But now, it's a different reason. One can  legislate,  but
one can never legislate for people to change their attitudes. Our  sport  is
still run by racist people, whether we like it  or  not.  And  I  speak  ...
(Interjections.) And if it were not so, we would not be talking  about  this
today. I can only appeal to  everybody  concerned  today,  that,  for  God's
sake, we should walk the road  of  nonracialism  as  we  knew  it  then.  We
strived a lot and suffered a lot for this,  so  they  should  not  come  and
spoil it  at  this  stage,  because  we  will  not  allow  them  to  do  it.
[Applause.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Mr Chairperson, the history of our country  is  fraught  with
lessons in conflict resolution, which  teaches  us  essentially  that,  when
communication breaks down, it is a reflection of the negative  attitudes  of
one or both parties to the conflict.

One needs to ask, in this particular instance, whether it was positive  that
the UCB informed the Minister at the last minute of its  decision?  Does  it
reflect a positive attitude? When the process  is  flawed,  the  outcome  is
bound to be flawed.

What normally does and, in this case, must pull parties together -  in  this
conflict, it must happen urgently before next year's Cricket World Cup -  is
the aggregation of the views of the shared constituencies, you  and  I,  the
people of South Africa.

The following questions beg to be asked. Did the UCB consult  widely  enough
amongst its constituency? Were  the  views  expressed  by  its  constituency
reflected with sufficient accuracy in its reports  and  its  media  releases
from the transformation monitoring committee and the executive committee  at
the UCB? We need to ask: What mandate and legitimacy did  the  UCB  have  to
make such an announcement? If the  UCB's  consultation  and  decision-making
processes were indeed flawed, as the commission of inquiry seems  to  reveal
according to the Minister's speech, then the UCB has made a  mockery  of  an
issue of such grave national importance regarding the  need  for  the  quota
system that it sets back a proper  and  healthy  debate  on  this  issue  by
another 10 years.

I wish to place on record that we need to transform and that the New  NP  is
for transformation of the imbalances of the past, but we are not happy  with
the quota system as a means  of  transformation.  We  need  to  debate  this
thoroughly. This debate is not being conducted  in  a  healthy  environment.
[Interjections.] No, it is transformation that is needed. That objective  is
a shared objective. It is the means that we need to get clarity on.

There is enough common ground between the UCB, the Ministry and the  parties
in this House for us to agree on it. I do not think we are seeing the  light
here.

Perhaps that debate should not take place in this  House  alone,  but  in  a
focused workshop  or  conference  where  all  parties  in  this  debate  can
participate in a healthy manner.

Mr C T FROLICK: Chairperson and hon members, the process  that  had  started
with the composition of the task team and ended with the report, during  the
past week, being shoved from pillar to post at the headquarters of  the  UCB
by individuals refusing to accept  responsibility  clearly  illustrates  the
untenable situation that is being created.  Indeed,  a  stand-off  has  been
created between the Government and certain individuals within the UCB.

I do not doubt the integrity of the task team which the Minister  appointed,
because they are known as knowlegable individuals who are  serving  and  who
have served sport in the best interest of all South Africans.  At  the  same
time, I have no doubt as to the integrity of individuals  still  serving  in
the UCB, including Percy Sonn and Gerald  Majola,  of  their  commitment  to
transform South African  cricket.  It,  however,  must  be  stated  that  an
antagonistic approach will  merely  lead  to  unnecessary  conflict  and  to
undermine the nation-building exercise.

Whilst  sport  bodies  must  remain  independent,  it  must   also   satisfy
Government and Parliament of their  commitment  to  ensure  that  all  South
Africans have equal access to participate in sport  at  the  highest  level.
This must translate  on  the  part  of  the  UCB  in  specific  targets  and
strategies to ensure representivity in all national  and  provincial  teams,
since anybody involved in cricket will attest to  the  fact  that  there  is
indeed current underrepresentation in certain regions.

Sport is a national asset and it requires intervention at the  right  stage.
It is therefore vital for the Minister to remain  true  to  his  undertaking
this afternoon, for him not to impose his will on the  UCB,  but  to  engage
them. Similarly, the UCB has a moral obligation towards the nation to  prove
that their strategies are succeeding.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Chairperson, many sportsmen and sportswomen believe  that
when labelled as a quota player,  they  are  not  recognised  for  achieving
their selection through merit, skill or potential, but  rather  to  fill  up
space with an inferior player or  competitor.  This  stigma  has  negatively
impacted the performance of many of our players as undue pressure  has  been
placed on them to deliver, whether they  are  ready  or  not.  It  has  also
stunted and prematurely brought their sporting careers to an end.

As the ACDP, we do not believe that quotas  are  a  good  idea,  but  we  do
realise that Government is forced to pursue it. Our view  is  that  emphasis
should be placed  on  development  at  schools  and  clubs.  We  agree  that
transformation brings about stability and strongly call on the national  and
provincial federations to bring about this integration. The ACDP  recognises
that although room has been given  for  federations  to  change,  many  show
their reluctance to do so. Resistance to change always brings about  anarchy
and we urge all federations to  speed  up  their  policies  on  development.
These federations have a duty and obligation to  the  South  African  public
who supports them financially to develop champions that would make us  proud
to be South Africans, irrespective of the colour of their skin.

The ACDP strongly recommends that ongoing development  must  take  place  in
our schools, clubs, and  organisations  involved  in  the  various  sporting
codes.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Geagte Voorsitter, die  agbare  Minister  het  nou  maar
eenmaal nie die vermoë om sy politiek te skei  van  sy  verantwoordelikheid,
as Minister van Sport, om in die belang van sport op te  tree  nie.  Die  VF
wil baie duidelik boekstaaf  dat  die  agbare  Minister  se  optrede  en  sy
vereiste dat ten minste ses swart spelers in die wêreldbeker  volgende  jaar
moet wees - dit is wat die agbare Minister self gesê het; ek kan lees en  ek
het geluister- tot die nadeel van sport is, en die agbare Minister is  besig
om sport te politiseer.

Die VF se standpunt is dat meriete moet geld, want  dan  het  jy  die  beste
mense wat die sport beoefen. Die VF is ook  ten  gunste  van  transformasie,
maar ek wil vandag vir die Minister sê: begin  transformasie  op  die  regte
vlak, naamlik die laagste vlak. As die Minister krieket wil bevorder,  begin
om skole krieket behoorlik te bevorder en te  transformeer.  Ek  wil  vandag
vir die Minister sê: sportontwikkeling  is  'n  proses.  Dit  is  'n  proses
waardeur dit moet gaan; daar is nie 'n kitsoplossing nie.  As  die  Minister
aandag gee aan die proses, verseker ek hom dat hy die beste sportmanne  gaan
kry. Die Minister is aan die mense van Suid-Afrika verskuldig om  die  beste
mense daar  te  kry.  [Tyd  verstreke.].[Tussenwerpsels.].  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows).

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Chairperson, the hon Minister just simply  does  not
have the ability  to  separate  his  politics  from  his  responsibility  as
Minister of Sport in order to act in the interest of sport. The FF wants  to
state very clearly for the record that the hon Minister's behaviour and  his
prerequisite that at least six black players should  be  in  the  world  cup
next year - that is what the hon Minister said himself; I  can  read  and  I
have listened - will be to the detriment of sport and the  hon  Minister  is
busy politicising sport.

The position of the FF is that merit should apply,  because  then  you  have
the best people that take part in the sport. The FF is  also  in  favour  of
transformation, but today  I  want  to  say  to  the  Minister:  Start  with
transformation at the  correct  level,  namely  the  lowest  level.  If  the
Minister wants to promote cricket, he must start  to  properly  promote  and
transform school cricket. Today  I  want  to  say  to  the  Minister:  Sport
development is a process. It is a process  that  has  to  be  gone  through;
there is not a magic solution.  If  the  Minister  gives  attention  to  the
process, then I assure  him  that  he  will  get  the  best  sportsmen.  The
Minister owes it to the people of South Africa to obtain  the  best  people.
[Time expired.] [Interjections.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members can we have some order  in
the House.

Ms S RAJBALLY: The cricket quota system  is  quite  intricate  to  draw  any
conclusions on. There are so many aspects to take into consideration.

It is by all means true that the  South  African  cricket  team  is  exactly
that, South African, and thereby should  reflect  a  representation  of  the
South African people. Many say that it is  predominantly  white  in  content
and that we need much more people of colour incorporated. The MF  celebrates
the fact that we are rich in talent, and is confident that as this  branches
from one ethnic group to the next, it would enable us such representation.

However, reality is that it is not all about representation.  Cricket  is  a
sport, a game and the recruiting of members should be based  on  merits  and
proficient skills. At the end of the day, every member of the  cricket  team
is of South African nationality. The MF expresses that it would be  nice  to
see more people of colour in the cricket team.

Ms N R NTSHULANA-BHENGU: Chairperson, I rise to welcome the  report  of  the
ministerial committee of inquiry into transformation in cricket. We, as  the
ANC, commend the committee members for their efforts  at  investigating  and
compiling this report. We also commend the  Minister  for  setting  up  this
committee of inquiry.

The United Cricket Board of SA adopted the  transformation  charter  at  its
historic National Vision Conference held in Johannesburg on  13-15  November
1998.  This  document,  which   emphasises   redress,   representivity   and
development amongst its 10 strategic thrusts, made cricket a role-player  in
the broader national process of change  and  democratisation.  We  applauded
the boldness of cricket in embracing the fundamental  aims  of  redress  and
representivity, as well as the need for a new paradigm.

Quotas in cricket were introduced  to  ensure  that  cricket  moved  towards
meeting its transformation objectives of being representative at all  levels
and in all spheres of the game. Sadly, not  everyone  was  happy  with  this
progress made in integrating cricket in particular  and  sport  in  general.
The same elements were the first to cheer when the United Cricket  Board  of
SA announced its unfortunate decision  to  scrap  the  quota  system.  These
elements  found  useful  allies   in   certain   political   parties   whose
preoccupation is grabbing newspaper headlines.

To these parties, the mere mention  of  the  word  ``transformation''  stops
them from thinking and triggers the computer programme  in  their  minds  to
make the kind of noise we are used to hearing from them. We  have  no  words
for these parties other than to say  that  they  would  not  have  chosen  a
better spokesperson than Louis Luyt,  of  the  infamous  Struggle  Rugby:  A
Sport in Crisis. We as the ANC will continue to pursue the agenda of  social
transformation,  and   we   encourage   cricket   to   continue   with   its
transformation agenda.
Recent incidents in sport indicate that those opposed to transformation  and
unity in sport will stop at nothing  to  advance  their  selfish  agenda  of
making sport, especially cricket, the  preserve  of  the  minority.  Amongst
these incidents is the one in  KwaZulu-Natal  in  which  two  white  players
allegedly threatened to resign if a fellow black player was selected  for  a
Dolphins side. Chester Williams, a  Springbok  rugby  star,  claims  in  his
recent book that he has had to endure some  racism  in  the  Springbok  game
from fellow players. These  incidents  indicate  that  it  is  necessary  to
maintain a system which allows the national leaders of the UCB to  intervene
so as to ensure that cricket is not retarded in the process  of  integration
and building nonracialism.

We are concerned that the process of arriving at this far-reaching  decision
to scrap the quota system was flawed because, as  this  report  states,  not
all legitimate stakeholders in cricket were consulted.  The  fact  that  the
decision was reached using inadequate information, as the  report  says,  is
another cause of concern.
We also note that not enough was done to take  cricket  to  some  previously
disadvantaged areas.  Yet,  in  some  of  these  areas,  where  there  is  a
tradition of cricket, there are not enough cricket clubs.  We  also  propose
that cricket acts on the recommendations of  the  ministerial  committee  of
inquiry.

In conclusion, we would like to state that the statement  by  the  UCB  CEO,
Gerald Majola, in which he says that cricket will  not  be  dictated  to  by
outside bodies, is insensitive and does not contribute to the need  for  the
co-operation that we all want. The statement flies in the  face  of  efforts
at transparency and the requirement for consultation. The UCB must  run  its
affairs  in  the  context  of  the  government   transformation   programme.
[Applause.]

                THE ROLE OF PARLIAMENT IN ALLEVIATING POVERTY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The SPEAKER: Chairperson and hon members, I do not intend today to  describe
the existence or extent of poverty in South Africa. I think  that  is  self-
evident. I wish to focus rather on what we can do and what we are  going  to
do to address the scourge of poverty that affects this nation.

The focus needs to be on us, the representatives elected  by  voters  -  who
are largely those who live in poverty - as well as on  this  institution  of
Parliament. Too often our debates here are about what  someone  else  should
do or has not done, or about laying blame for past action  and  failures  or
current predilections or omissions.

This Parliament is an extremely powerful  one,  with  authority  and  powers
entrenched in the Constitution, yet we are the ones who have imposed  limits
on what we can and cannot do. We define  our  functions  in  a  manner  that
either  explicitly  excludes  certain  action  or  by  implication  inhibits
Parliament  and  what  Parliament  does.  We  limit  ourselves  to  debating
policies presented to us and  engaging  in  monitoring  or  oversight,  over
expenditure or the manner and degree of implementation after the  event.  In
this way some only, of course, applaud and others only  criticise.  In  this
way, we remain outside the  process,  acting  mainly  as  observers,  praise
singers, critics, auditors and coroners, rather than the activists  that  we
have been.

The very title of this debate already sets limits and here I  plead  guilty.
The alleviation of poverty can only be a first step  in  what  must  be  our
objective, namely the eradication of poverty towards which  policy  must  be
directed, even as we may provide some improvements in  the  daily  lives  of
the population.

To an extent, we can  alleviate  poverty  by  higher  welfare  payments  and
grants and measures such as price control and subsidies, as has  been  done.
Inevitably, this will always be limited by existing  resources  and  provide
no long-term solutions. Eradication will  require  sustainable  development,
as the decisions  and  targets  set  at  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development reveal.  This  will  involve  a  range  of  programmes:  health,
sanitation, education,  skilling,  employment,  technology,  communications,
etc. Each one of us  can  add  to  this  list  or  pick  one  aspect.  Taken
together, what is indicated  is  integrated  policies  and  programmes  that
incorporate all of these  as  they  affect  particular  situations  and  are
applied as a coherent whole to contribute to the eradication of poverty.

The question for Parliament is: To what extent  has  the  National  Assembly
organised itself to look at policy in this integrated way,  whether  in  the
making, consideration, implementation or evaluation; and does our  oversight
take into account the integration of policy and expenditure? To what  extent
have we organised our committees to function across government  departments?
Should we perhaps be reorganising  committees?  Should  Parliament  and  the
Government  not  consider  whether  the  current  division  of  departmental
portfolios is appropriate and whether integration should simply be  a  joint
consideration that the clustering system implies, or a more radical  rethink
and restructuring?
In announcing  the  measures  to  address  high  food  prices,  the  Cabinet
indicated the number of departments that would need  to  be  involved.  What
did we do as Parliament? Have our committees considered  the  measures?  And
here, should we not have had reports to inform this debate and  to  consider
what we could do? And here I should say - and I do not  want  applause  from
the left - that I did receive a request from the DP  for  a  debate  on  the
high prices and suggested instead that we have this broader debate  on  what
Parliament should do. [Applause.]

The Cabinet statement refers to the need  for  partnerships  and  action  at
community level. When this term ends on 14 November, we need to  participate
in ensuring that the ameliorative measures have the desired effect.

The success of policies is dependent on  the  extent  and  accuracy  of  the
information base. Members  of  Parliament  are  uniquely  placed  to  inform
policy-making and to make significant inputs into  its  impact  as  well  as
measuring  the  degree  of  implementation.  The  rationale   for   a   more
participatory form of democracy and an ongoing dialogue  between  Government
and people is grounded in the view that where people  are  not  involved  in
the decisions  that  affect  their  lives,  social  policies  and  political
interventions will fail. Equally, the best information on the needs  of  the
poor, on whether policies and programmes are  reaching  the  targets,  comes
from the poor themselves.

In most systems, certain people or interests have greater  access  to  power
and decision-making than others. Patterns of  access  tend  to  reflect  the
socioeconomic landscape and the inequalities of society.  If  Parliament  is
to change these socioeconomic inequalities, we need to  proactively  arrange
for accessing those without resources and listening to them.

It is relatively straightforward  to  identify  where  the  inequalities  in
South Africa lie and which groups are most  vulnerable  to  poverty.  It  is
perhaps less easy to appreciate that this relates to potential  inequalities
in public participation and the actions by Parliament  to  deal  with  them.
The aim of public participation must be to  provide  poor  people  with  the
opportunity to make their circumstances known and  to  express  their  needs
and grievances and offer their own solutions and priorities.

Clearly then,  Parliament  has  to  evaluate  the  programmes  we  have  and
consider how we are going to ensure that the views of  the  poorest  of  the
poor and their needs are incorporated into policy-making,  into  legislation
and into implementation, and that  their  views  are  sought  in  accessing,
implementation and impact. So it  is  not  enough  to  continue  to  conduct
public hearings as we do now. We need to rethink and  find  innovative  ways
to deal with public participation.

We also need to look at ways of strengthening civil  society,  and  I  refer
here  not  only  to  NGOs,   but   more   importantly   to   community-based
organisations, as well as informal  associations  of  the  homeless,  youth,
women, workers, the disabled, rural  people's  movements,  etc.  And  on  an
informed basis we need to consider and  recommend  ways  of  providing  more
public resources to such representative organisations. In addition, MPs  are
a major source of information on the impact  of  government  programmes  and
the manner and effectiveness of implementation.

This information need not be confined within political parties and  used  to
further their  narrow  interests.  It  should  be  brought  here  to  inform
debates.  Question  time  provides  us  with  an  opportunity  to  draw  the
attention of Ministers  to  local  impacts  and  problems.  But  do  we  use
Questions that way or are they simply an occasion for party  combat  and  to
use information for particular advantage? Do we try to trip  up  a  Minister
or provide a platform? Could we not draw the attention  of  members  of  the
executive to problems and  difficulties  that  we  find  and  try  and  seek
solutions for them?

Legislators can and should go beyond debating policy and the  technicalities
of legislation. Committees could assist in  identifying  potential  problems
of implementation when policies and programmes are  first  mooted,  and  not
only conduct inquests or postmortems after they arise and,  with  hindsight,
we can say that Parliament  should  have  done  so  before  the  maintenance
legislation was finalised or  at  the  same  time.  And  we  may  well  have
prevented the two-year difficulty that has been  engaged  in  in  trying  to
implement good legislation.

Similarly,  committees  could,  and  in   our   constituencies,   we   could
systematically visit clinics, schools, look at  transport  and  engage  with
local communities in ensuring that  integrated  development  programmes  are
produced and also feed their collective experience back to the  Assembly  to
assist in providing remedy or relief.

If the Whippery can be persuaded to co-operate across party lines  -  and  I
must say I put that forward only as an occasional measure - and if we  could
agree that at a particular time all MPs will visit pension payout points  or
hospitals or some other facility to  identify  systemic  problems  and  come
back  to  debate  possible  improvements  and  solutions,  we  can  make   a
considerable impact and provide a  basis  for  ministerial  or  departmental
intervention.

I understand the hon  Ellis  and  Jeffery  have  already  planned  such  co-
ordinated action during the forthcoming recess and we can  look  forward  to
their joint report when we come back. I have been asked,  on  their  behalf,
to request other MPs to join their initiative. I  see  very  puzzled  looks,
but I assure members this is actually something they have been planning.

The activities I have indicated require a legislature  transformed  to  meet
the needs of  a  developing  country  in  Africa,  within  a  constitutional
framework that is amongst the most enlightened and progressive. I  am  aware
that the proactive involvement of Parliament that I  suggest  requires  some
rethinking and a broadening of  the  role  of  Parliament.  It  may  require
political courage, but it does not require a  change  in  the  Constitution,
only in our  mind-sets.  Indeed,  I  suggest  that  we  would  fail  in  our
constitutional  obligations  if  we  do  not  intervene  in  the   direction
suggested, though not necessarily in the specific activities that have  been
proposed.  It  is  with  such  interventions  as  participants  rather  than
observers, monitors, auditors  and  coroners  that  Parliament  can  play  a
meaningful role  and  contribute  to  the  eradication  of  poverty  in  our
society.

If Parliament only becomes an actor  after  the  event,  then  we  will  not
succeed in eradicating poverty for many decades and will fall short  of  the
goals and the targets that we have set for ourselves,  and  we  may  end  up
conducting oversight to establish the reasons for  failure  rather  than  to
contribute to success in the eradication of this national scourge  upon  us.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Mr  Chairperson,  Madam
Speaker and hon members, if we accept that poverty is  one  of  the  biggest
threats to our young democracy, and that Parliament is one of  the  greatest
expressions of our democracy, then it follows  that  members  of  Parliament
and the very institution  they  represent  are  key  players  in  the  fight
against poverty, as it threatens our very existence. Furthermore, if we  are
firm in our belief that poverty eradication is a  noble  goal,  we  have  to
realise that it is not so easy to achieve immediately.

However, we acknowledge that what we can do now,  is  to  work  towards  the
alleviation of poverty. We immediately move away from a situation  of  being
helpless, as these members, and start to find meaning in the  work  that  we
do on a daily basis through our interventions  and  committee  meetings,  as
well as in our  constituency  work.  I  speak  here  also  as  a  member  of
parliament, even though  I  am  in  the  executive.  I  recognise  that,  as
parliamentarians, we are uniquely placed to contribute significantly in  the
fight against poverty. As the overseers of Government and the developers  of
the laws that govern our country, we can influence the direction  of  policy
towards the fight against poverty.

The Speaker has raised  a  very  important  issue  in  her  intervention  on
whether we do this after the fact and not at the point at  which  policy  is
developed. I would actually say that we are on both sides of it, because  as
activists and members of our political parties, we  are  able  to  influence
policy development to ensure that those who are governing  can  be  able  to
take interest in issues that we raise on policy matters.  However,  we  also
have another chance. When we sit here as members of  Parliament  to  oversee
whether those policies are, indeed, what we would like for our  country,  we
are also able to make another intervention. Maybe we will always have to  do
both, but maybe, more importantly, we will have to  do  so  at  the  initial
phase.

Parliament, through its structures such as portfolio and select  committees,
offers us an opportunity  to  inform  the  electorate  about  policies  that
affect them, as well as to receive their inputs  on  whether  such  policies
actually improve their situation for the better. As members  of  Parliament,
though not directly elected through a constituency-based  electoral  system,
we have created opportunities for interaction with this  electorate  through
the constituency offices that we have throughout our country.  The  question
that we need to ask ourselves is probably whether  we  do  our  constituency
work in the manner that assists those communities to be in touch  with  what
we do in this House, or whether we take some of those constituency weeks  as
part of our additional holidays with the family. I know that  that  is  also
important. The challenge, however, that we also face is to evaluate  whether
or not the current policies and programmes, as well as the legislation  that
we have passed in this House, are adequate in helping us to fight poverty.

The other question that I think needs to be deliberated on  in  this  debate
is a question that  the  Speaker  has  already  highlighted  in  her  input,
regarding whether  or  not  through  the  way  we  are  structured  as  this
Parliament we are able to ensure  that  we  can  bring  the  issues  of  our
communities to this House and make an impact  in  the  manner  in  which  we
interact both with the executive  and  also  with  other  policy-makers,  to
ensure that what they do has an impact on those we serve.

My own view is that, at a policy level, I can say  with  certainty  that  we
have been able to make sound and  adequate  policies  in  dealing  with  the
challenge  of  poverty.  A  general  evaluation  of  the  success   of   the
Reconstruction and Development Programme, which is a broad  policy  of  this
Government and this Parliament, will indicate that indeed we have made  some
impact. The delivery of water  and  access  to  housing,  as  well  as  land
reforms and many others are but an indication of how far we  have  moved  in
attempting to deal with the challenge of poverty in  our  country.  However,
we would all agree that there is still more that we need  to  do  to  ensure
that, at the implementation level, we can deal with the challenges  that  we
continue to face.

In my view this Parliament, through its committees, has been  able  in  some
way to ensure that they bring to the executive some  of  the  concerns  that
arise at the implementation level of our  policies,  sometimes  to  indicate
existing  areas  of  capacity  or  incapacity  and  inexperience.   As   the
executive, when we interact and relook our policies  and  how  we  implement
them, we are therefore guided by the views that come from this Parliament.

I also want to say to  the  Speaker  and  hon  members  that  our  committee
processes, particularly when it comes to the legislative processes  as  well
as the review  of  the  Budget,  are  able  to  bring  closer  to  home  the
challenges our electorate is faced with, and they are also able to  make  an
impact on the direction that we may need to take.

However, who has access to this Parliament? If we talk  about  participatory
democracy, one of the things we would accept is that there is a yes  and  no
answer to this question. The majority of those who have resources  are  able
to fly to Cape Town and interact with us and tell  us  what  they  want  and
what they do not want. But the majority of those who are poor  do  not  have
access to this House.  Mindful  of  this  challenge,  our  Speaker  and  the
members of this Parliament, including  myself,  have  realised  that  it  is
important to have interaction with the communities at  the  point  at  which
they are. The majority of the portfolio committees have visited a number  of
provinces and regions to  get  to  know  the  views  of  the  electorate  on
particular legislation. But again, because of limited resources, we are  not
able to reach each and every individual in our country.

In this House we have also provided the electronic medium of television.  We
are able to interact and ensure that our people at least can  hear  what  we
say here and see whether we represent them fairly or not. However, we  might
need to improve at that level. The majority of South  Africans  do  not  yet
have access to television. Is not possible to have a slot on the  radio  and
perhaps a write-up, or a parliamentary paper,  which  could  be  used  as  a
medium to interact with our constituencies so that  they  can  evaluate  for
themselves whether what we are doing here is, indeed, what they  have  asked
us to do?

At government level, in order to address the same  problem,  we  started  an
outreach programme known as Imbizo, to close the  gap  between  us  and  the
electorate so that they can also hear  at  firsthand  if  what  we  do  does
indeed affect our communities positively. I want to agree with  the  Speaker
that, as members of Parliament, we remain activists and that our  work  does
not just end in these corridors of Parliament  or  in  the  committees,  but
that we also  need  to  ensure  that  we  become  part  and  parcel  of  our
communities  through  our  experience  and  knowledge,  to  ensure  that  we
participate in those civil structures in order to change  the  circumstances
of our people for the better.

I must say that some members of Parliament have indeed been able to  do  so,
but many will still have to do so, so that we do not  just  become  armchair
politicians who sit here being critical, saying this has not  been  done  to
deal  with  poverty.  We  ourselves  must  do  something   to   change   the
circumstances for the better. We have a challenge of  dealing  with  poverty
in our communities, not only today  or  maybe  as  an  intervention  in  the
immediate term. In order to redress the legacy of our past, we will have  to
be there most of the time, so that when we come to this Parliament,  we  can
be proud that each one of us as a person has done something  to  change  the
lives of our people. [Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Mr Chairperson and hon members, I could  not  agree  with  the
Speaker more, but I wish to tell her that the alleviation of poverty is  the
task of the Government and the executive, not  of  Parliament.  Parliament's
job is to hold the executive to account. We as legislators have  to  see  to
it  that  the  Government  takes  steps  to  alleviate  poverty.  When   the
Government fails, as it has done, it  is  Parliament's  task  to   tell  the
Government and also to tell the people that the Government has failed.

If passing laws and  enacting  legislation  could  create  employment,  then
South  Africa  would  have  full  employment,  not  the  many  millions   of
unemployed, who are the reality  of  a  nation  which,  in  many  areas  and
places, is not working. This Parliament has  passed  many,  many  laws,  but
instead of creating jobs and enhancing growth, they have actually  done  the
reverse of their intended and stated aims. The reality is  that  legislation
cannot create a booming economy and regulations which go against  the  grain
of a market economy often destroy jobs better and faster than they know.

Employers and entrepreneurs are the best and most enduring builders of  ways
out of poverty, not bureaucrats and politicians.  It  is  a  pity  that  the
Minister of Trade and  Industry  is  not  here.  We  would  have  given  him
information  on  how  entrepreneurs  experience   the   policies   of   this
Government.

In addition to this,  however,  legislators  should  and  can  play  a  much
greater  role  in  the  realisation  of  the  people's  rights   under   the
Constitution and in the eradication of poverty. The role  of  Parliament  so
far has  stopped  at  debating  predetermined  policy  and  some  monitoring
oversight over expenditure  and  implementation.  The  Constitution  demands
that we play an interventional role in all areas of the process.

Since 1994, public expectations have been running high. The policies of  the
Government have been  built  on  relatively  full  employment  and  steadily
increasing national wealth. This  meant  that  the  views  and  interest  of
labour and others are believed to weigh more  heavily  than  they  had  done
during apartheid in the conducting of national affairs.

Sadly, unemployment,  political  education  and  organization  to  meet  the
objectives of a  more  participatory  democracy  are  underrated,  and  have
almost disappeared from the national agenda.

Political status inside and outside Parliament reflects a scale  of  values,
which gives low priority to the problems of the poor.  Despite  legislatures
and  executives  being  predominantly  populated   by   persons   from   the
historically disadvantaged with first-hand acquaintance with poverty,  there
are fewer than a dozen members of Parliament who speak with authority  about
the operation of the social security system.

Yet this system provides all or most of the livelihood of the poor.  The  DA
advocated the basic income grant as long ago as  1998.  But  because  it  is
championed by the DA, the Government would not accept it.  Evidence  by  the
Ministry of Social Development survey, are the following:  "School  children
from poor families do not get free  school  meals."  The  ANC  is  not  even
capable of organising peanut butter sandwiches. The Eastern  Cape  at  least
is a case in point. Pension  allocations  are  arbitrarily  stopped  in  the
Eastern Cape. Three hundred and  thirty-five  poverty  alleviation  projects
have collapsed  in  Gauteng.  The  reason  for  this?  Official  apathy  and
incompetence play a large part here.

The problem  of  social  representation  does  not  just  stop  with  social
security. It spreads into related issues. The education  system  is  another
case in point. Lack of delivery of  social  services,  including  education,
constant changes and revision of  curriculums,  the  brain  drain  from  our
institutions, and the unwise decisions by Government  to  allow  experienced
and highly skilled teachers and management to take  severance  packages  has
weakened education.

The introduction of the national lottery into the economic  system  has  not
helped. One point four billion is in the coffers  of  the  state  lottery  -
undistributed. The distribution of the lotto  money  is  skewed.  Many  NGOs
have collapsed because of the lack of funds. The  irony  is  that  the  poor
people who are playing  the  Lotto  invariably  subsidise  the  Government's
agenda and coffers, and it is the indirect taxation of the poor. The  number
of rich people who are playing the Lotto is very negligible. It is  urgently
necessary that provisions be made for amending the budget.

In the final analysis, legislatures have the power to  deny  resources,  and
in that way, effect allocation. But, guess what, ANC's  MPs,  even  when  it
comes to the budget, always press blue, whether blue has  the  interests  of
the poor at heart or not, they just press blue! [Interjections.]

Take the huge arms package. The DA opposed it, but the ANC  members  had  to
keep quiet.

[In relative terms ... [Time expired.] [Interjections.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Deputy Chairperson and hon members, I  want  to  thank  the
Speaker very much for bringing up this debate  today,  because  we  need  to
take action. Allow me to read the Preamble of  our  Constitution:  "We,  the
people of South Africa recognise the injustices of our past".  I  will  also
read   another   line:   "We   therefore,   through   the   freely   elected
representatives, adopt this Constitution." "We, through our  freely  elected
representative" means that, from today, as we have this debate, we  need  to
take steps because the Constitution itself has mandated us to take steps.

Poverty alleviation was high on the agenda at the  recent  World  Summit  on
Sustainable  Development  in  Johannesburg.  Targets  and  timeframes   were
identified. One of them was to halve the proportion of  people  in  poverty.
We have to halve the proportion of poverty by 2015; support the  development
of national programmes  and  strategies  to  promote  education  within  the
context of nationally owned strategies for poverty reduction.

Secondly, on  1  to  4  October  2002,  the  Gauteng  legislature  hosted  a
conference of parliamentarians - it was a conference on poverty  eradication
- where members of provinces and of this national Parliament  were  present.
The Speaker was also present. I would like to remind the Speaker and  inform
hon members of what she suggested, which we endorse, as the IFP.

She said that we needed the right policies. We  needed  the  institution  of
mechanisms to ensure implementation,  and  we  need  qualified  and  skilled
human  resources  to  operate  the  mechanism  of  motivation  to  eradicate
poverty. We need  adequate  financial  resources,  targeted  allocations  of
these, and proper  financial  management.  We  need  mechanisms  to  monitor
implementation and recommend correction. I  think  if  we  can  unpack  what
Madam Speaker suggested at that  conference,  even  today  we  can  see  the
results. But we  also  need  to  acknowledge  the  total  responsibility  of
Parliament and parliamentarians for the alleviation of poverty.

We, as  members  of  Parliament,  and  Parliament  itself  must  accept  the
responsibility for the alleviation of the suffering imposed by  poverty.  We
need pro-alleviation of poverty legislation, the monitoring of  all  poverty
alleviation programmes on the ground, alerting Parliament to all  new  needs
and problems caused by poverty. Parliament needs to create partnership  with
NGOs and empower them and the communities. An example of this could  be  the
Red Cross.

Akusizi ukuba sibanikeze izimali  njengama-CBO  nama  NGO  kodwa  singakwazi
ukuthi sibalekelele ukuba bakwazi ukuthi bazoziphatha  kanjani  lezi  zinto.
Ezinye zezinkinga ezikhona ukuthi  abaxhumanisi  sibanikeza  izimali  ukuthi
abaziphathe kodwa singazi ukuthi sibaqapha kanjani. Okunye  kwakho,  izimali
zendlala   zithathwe   bese   ziba   ngamaholo   amakhulu   anikeza    bona,
bazithuthukisa bona-ke manje. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)
[It does not help to give the CBOs and NGOs money if we cannot help them  to
know how to manage those funds. One other existing problem is that  we  give
money to consultants to manage but we do not  know  how  they  manage  those
funds. One of the problems is that poverty alleviation funds are  taken  and
used  as  big  salaries  for  consultants,  and  they  are  now   empowering
themselves.]

So our oversight role is to monitor what  the  consultants  are  doing  with
those moneys and those funds, and the resources that have been given to  our
poor people.

Empowerment of the  three  spheres  of  government  in  poverty  alleviation
programmes through the oversight function must take  place.  Parliament  and
legislatures should play a role in all phases of the budget  cycle  process.
We need  resources  and  skills  that  are  required  to  pursue  a  poverty
alleviation  agenda  through  parliamentary   activities.   The   House   of
Traditional Leaders need to be empowered to fight poverty as  they  are  the
most affected people.
Indlu yabaholi bendabuko iyona ehlangene nengwadla  kakhulu,  okunye  kwakho
okwakukuhle  kuqala  kodwa  osekwasuswa,  kuwukuthi   kwakunomkhuba   omuhle
owawubhekiswe  ebuntwini,   wokuthi   kukhona   ukwenanelana,   ukusiselana.
Kungekho umuntu ophethwe ububha, kodwa kwathi ngoba sekufika impucuko,  yabe
seyithatha zonke lezi zinto ezinhle  ezabe  zikhona.  (Translation  of  Zulu
paragraph follows.)

[The House of Traditional Leaders is the one that is facing a  big  problem,
as some of the things that were good before were taken  away.  There  was  a
good  custom  regarding  humanity,  the  "ukwenanelana"   and   "ukusiselana
customs". No one was suffering from poverty. But when  Western  civilization
came, it destroyed all the good things which existed.]

The eradication of poverty requires more than making larger payment  welfare
payments. These are necessary,  but  they  can  only  temporarily  alleviate
poverty. The impact of  HIV/Aids  may  well  increase  reliance  on  welfare
assistance over time as family breadwinners are affected by these  diseases.
The data in this regard will need to be analysed sensitively to ensure  that
a correct understanding  is  achieved  of  the  relationship  between  grant
dependants on HIV/Aids, unemployment, and employment growth.

Kwenziwa  yithi  njengamamalungu   ePhalamende,   ngithi   sekushiwo   lokhu
ngabakhulume ngaphambi kwami ukuthi sineqhatha elikhulu thina  njengamalungu
ePhalamende lokuba siye laphaya siyokhuluma nabantu.  (Translation  of  Zulu
paragraph follows.)

[It has been mentioned by  the  previous  speaker  that  we  as  members  of
Parliament have a role to go there and speak to people.]

MPs need to be empowered with the capacity, support and expertise to  enable
them to engage in and contribute to the process effectively.

Allow  me  to  put  our  IFP  oversight  proposal  to  monitor  the  poverty
alleviation programme. Each member of Parliament, during  constituency  week
or month, has to go back to his own  constituency  and  collect  information
about poverty alleviation, and come back and report here.

Phambi kwakho somlomo. Mhlawumbe uke usinikeze nethuba nje ukuthi  usidedele
inkundla  ukuthi  mhlawumbe  noma  njengesifundazwe   sike   sibike   ukuthi
kwenzekani.  Yikuphi  okukhona  okusuka  kulesiya  sifundazwe.  Uke  udedele
iMpumalanga Kapa ike isukume ibike, udedele iKwaZulu-Natali  sigiye  udedele
nabanye  nabo  basukume  bagiye,  sibike  ukuthi  kwenzekani  ngokuncishiswa
kwendlala, nangendlala uqobo lwayo lapho sisuka khona. (Translation of  Zulu
paragraph follows.)

[Madam Speaker, perhaps you should give us a chance to take  turns,  perhaps
on behalf of each and every province, to report on what is happening to  say
what is available in which province. Perhaps you you could let  the  Eastern
Cape submit a report, then get KwaZulu-Natal to submit a report, as well  as
others also to come and submit reports as to what is happening with  regards
to poverty alleviation where we come from.]

Members must  engage  the  executive  through  questions  and  report  their
observations in their constituencies, for example, in  respect  of  housing,
HIV/Aids, sanitation and orphans. Members of Parliament must  ask  Ministers
to unpack what they have in their different departments about  poverty.  For
example...

Asazi ukuthi kukhonani  eMnyangweni  wezokuVikela,  asazi  ukuthi  kukhonani
kowezeMidlalo mayelana nokuncishiswa kwendlala. Noma,  ngiyalinganisa  ngale
minyango,   asazi   ukuthi   kukhonani   eMnyangweni    weziokuHlunyeleliswa
kweziMilo,  asazi  ukuthi  kukhonani  kowezaMaciko  naMasiko,  asazi  ukuthi
kukhonani  kweminye  iminyango.  Yebo  ukhona  siyazi   ukuthi   eMnyangweni
kaMongameli kukhonani, kodwa kufanele sazi ukuthi kukhonani,  yikuphi  lapho
singaklomula khona siyise laphaya. Ngisho nohulumeni wasekhaya unazo  ezinye
izinto esingaxomula kuzona. Ngasho ngakujonga Sekela Ngqongqoshe, kodwa  nje
sengisholo  ukuthi  singakwazi  ukuthi  sicaphune  sizwe  ukuthi  kukhonani.
(Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[We do not know what  there  is  regarding  poverty  in  the  Department  of
Defence. We do not know what is in the Department of Sport  and  Recreation.
I am using these departments as an example. We do not know what  is  in  the
Department of  Correctional  Services.  We  do  not  know  what  is  in  the
Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. We do not know what  is
in other departments. Yes, we know of what  is  in  the  Department  of  the
Presidency, but we should know about  what  we  can  get  and  take  to  the
people.  Even  a  local  government  has  things  from  which  we  can  take
something. It is a mistake that I am looking at the Deputy Minister as I  am
saying this because. What I mean is that we can take something once we  know
what is there.]

But we also need to ask ourselves about what  we  are  doing  about  poverty
alleviation. Singakhombi iminwe eyisihlanu, uma  ikhomba  ikhomba  le  kodwa
emithathu ikhomba thina. [Ihlombe.] [We should not point with five  fingers.
When one points with these fingers, three of them will point back to  us  as
to what we are doing about poverty alleviation. [Applause.]

Have we collected enough information about poverty from  our  constituencies
and given that to the Ministers? Have we done  that?  Have  we  engaged  the
executive to unpack what they have in respect  of  the  poverty  alleviation
programmes? Maybe the Speaker can devote time  here  with  Parliament,  with
those powers vested in her, to ask us what our observations were during  the
break and ask members to report back and also ask Ministers to respond.

Our IFP resolution during the Women's Brigade Conference  acknowledged  that
poverty is hitting women and girls hardest by re-enforcing the  gender  bias
in our society, with the statistics now revealing that the majority of  poor
homes throughout South Africa are headed by women of all  race  groups.  The
rules can also be changed in order to allow and encourage members  to  bring
about constituency issues.

In order to reach  the  poor,  parliamentarians  will  need  to  know  their
constituencies thoroughly, and must be able to  distinguish  the  poor  from
the overall constituencies. [Time expired.]
On that note, I support this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Mr Chairman, the New NP recognises  poverty  as  the
most immediate problem that faces our  nation  today.  It  carries  with  it
implications for  almost  every  facet  of  our  natural  life.  It  impacts
directly or indirectly on everyone in South Africa. More than  half  of  our
population's income is well below the minimum  that  is  necessary  to  make
ends meet and they are therefore living in some or other degree of poverty.

As much as the Government is doing to improve the quality of life  of  these
people, we have to acknowledge that  poverty  is  both  the  cause  and  the
result of economic inefficiency and the  underutilisation  of  the  nation's
resources.

Poverty impacts on our nation, from birth to  the  grave.  Poverty  destroys
the human dignity that our Constitution  seeks  to  protect.  Poverty  is  a
multidimensional phenomenon that reflects on the inability  to  satisfy  the
needs that result in a lack of education, poor health, malnutrition, a  lack
of shelter and violence and crime. Poverty is not only a very  public  issue
that is visible in many of our  communities,  it  is  also  a  very  private
experience for every individual who has to cope with it on a daily basis.

We have to acknowledge the fact that although the South African  economy  is
performing well in comparison to other economies in our region, we have  not
risen to our potential in  the  fight  against  poverty.  Redistribution  of
resources  without  expanded  production  and  economic  growth  cannot   be
sustained. At the  same  time,  prosperity  without  security  of  life  and
property also holds little appeal.

We have to deal with the issue of domestic poverty by seeking for  ourselves
a sustainable place in the  global  economy.  Our  aim  should  be  to  work
together for prosperity and a just  and  socially  responsible  society.  In
seeking a solution, we will have to recognise that income and  the  outcomes
of economic activity are determined by the  differences  between  individual
human beings.
We have to acknowledge that inequality is  a  normal  feature  of  any  free
society. In our  fight  against  poverty,  in  order  to  establish  a  just
society, we have to acknowledge  that  the  process  to  determine  economic
outcomes must be just and fair, affording each citizen equal opportunity  to
obtain the maximum return on his or her own efforts.

In attacking poverty, we have to  increase  the  thrust  of  the  short-term
programme to alleviate extreme poverty, with particular reference  to  those
who, through disability, Aids or externally induced economic  circumstances,
are unable to take part in the economic  process.  In  a  civilised  society
with a social conscience, it is our duty to protect these people  against  a
life of poverty.

In the medium and longer term, it is the duty of the  Government  to  create
circumstances that would be conducive to the reduction  of  poverty  through
the  individual  efforts  of  each  and  every  member  of  society  and  in
particular of the  poor  themselves,  working  towards  ensuring  their  own
wellbeing and prosperity.
In order to reach  these  objectives,  we  should  concentrate  on  economic
growth, with the creation of employment as the first priority, private  free
enterprise as a basis of the production economy, the promotion and  security
of private property rights, the integration of South Africa  into  a  global
economic mainstream and the development of public-private partnerships.

In conclusion, the New NP believes that  the  war  on  poverty  is  not  the
responsibility of Government alone, but of  each  and  every  citizen  in  a
socially  responsible  society,  not  least   the   poor   themselves.   The
establishment of  a  national  collaborative  framework  involving  all  the
relevant stakeholders is essential  to  achieve  the  alignment  of  effort.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: It is a pity that this debate  is  being
limited to mostly women speakers. I think the issue of  poverty  is  not  an
issue for women alone. It is an issue that ought to be occupying  our  minds
and our activities.

I do not know if that is why the DP decided to send  her  majesty,  Madam  R
Jankielsohn, to say what she wanted to say. I would like to quote  the  last
speaker, who said that the issue of poverty is not an  issue  only  for  the
executive but that it is an issue for all the representatives of our  people
and indeed not only for the  Government  alone  but  also  for  the  private
sector and generally all of our people.

As far as I know, the majority of South Africans  outside  this  House  have
taken that task on themselves. Last week,  I  signed  an  agreement  with  a
number of private sector companies led by Absa, which came  out  openly  and
said ``Poverty is an ill that should be  removed  from  the  face  of  South
Africa''. If, to the DP, this is an issue for Government alone, I think  the
DP has still very much to  learn.  I  hope  the  hon  lady  was  not  really
representing the DP.

The impact of food price inflation is  affecting  every  South  African.  As
parliamentarians, we represent constituencies from across  the  country  and
are well-placed to discern indications of the impact of  inflation.  We  are
ideally positioned to  observe  when  communities  are  experiencing  severe
poverty and hunger. Importantly, we are able to  enlighten  them  about  our
government programmes, and that they are in place to bring relieve to  them,
and that is what we are being paid to do, I wish to tell Madam  Jankielsohn.
Each day that we  sit  here,  it  is  with  the  purpose  to  enlighten  the
constituency that elected members into positions, and not leave  it  to  the
members of the ANC to  do  so.  We  do  represent  the  poor,  and  we  will
represent them up to the last. That member will sit there and  forget  where
she comes from. [Applause.]

I urge all public representatives to be proactive  in  ensuring  that  their
constituencies are fully informed about the social  grants  for  which  they
are eligible. Already 5 million  South  Africans  around  this  country  are
receiving social grants, but many more are still eligible and they  are  not
receiving it. It is Madam Jankielsohn's duty to go and tell them  that  they
are entitled to it.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Minister, it is Madam Sono although...

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT:  Oh  she  might  be  the  real  Sono  in
African languages! [Laughter.] In spite of publicity, it appears  that  many
potential beneficiaries are unaware of their rights to  child  support,  old
age pension, disability, foster care or other  grants.  When  next  visiting
their constituencies, the hon members of this House should call at  a  grant
payment point to encourage efficiency and ensure the effectiveness of  these
critical interventions by this Government. I wish  to  tell  that  to  Madam
Sono.

Members of Parliament should also be aware of the  poverty  relief  projects
in their areas. They  are  aimed  at  empowering  communities  by  means  of
training and capacity-building, the expansion of household asset  bases  and
improving access to finance, Madam Sono. In the short-term,  poverty  relief
interventions provide emergency food parcels and agricultural starter  packs
to encourage household food production initiatives. On a medium-term  basis,
community food production clusters are established to  capacitate  community
members for commercial farming  or  other  income-generating  projects.  Our
long-term intervention is to create access to  social  finance  for  starter
capital so that individuals or households can  start  their  own  commercial
projects.

Our poverty relief programmes has five objectives. These are to create  food
production clusters, to support caregivers of people affected  and  infected
by HIV/Aids, to increase the employability of  youth,  to  encourage  income
generation in activities  for  rural  women,  and  to  provide  multipurpose
centres to  encourage  the  involvement  of  older  persons  in  social  and
economic pursuits. Members of Parliament  should  ensure  that  they  become
conversant with the procedures for  writing  projects,  business  plans  and
should be knowledgeable on how to access funding.

Our constituency offices  around  the  country  are  ideally  positioned  to
provide information on these issues to all South Africans.  We  need  to  be
particularly concerned about the children of this country.  Sixty  per  cent
of our citizens aged below 18 are poor, and 30% are often hungry,  according
to the Idasa analysis of the October 1999 Household Survey. This is  why  we
are placing such emphasis on the registration of children for child  support
grants, I wish to tell Madam Sono.

People who are tasked with the buying of groceries to  feed  their  families
are acutely aware of the dramatic price  increases  that  have  occurred  in
recent years and, more especially, in the last few months. Sadly,  the  days
of spending R100 on food to keep the  family  going  for  a  month  are  now
ancient history. Statistics  SA  informs  us  that  the  consumer  price  of
vegetables has increased by 24% in the last 12 months. What does  this  mean
to the ordinary South African consumer?  It  means  that  to  buy  the  same
quantity of vegetables that one purchased for R50 in October 2001,  one  now
needs R62.

Similarly, the price of grain products has increased  by  22%  meaning  that
R200 worth of maize meal, bread, rice and spaghetti and grain  products  one
year ago now costs the consumer R244. The situation is  almost  as  bad  for
meat, fish and dairy products, and slightly less so for  fruit,  sugar,  tea
and coffee. These  figures  have  resulted  in  an  overall  consumer  price
increase of 20.2% for food in the last year. This  is  significantly  higher
than the CPIX which includes most of the non-food items as  well.  The  CPIX
has increased by 10,8% during the same  period.  It  appears  to  be  beyond
dispute that food price increases are the main drivers of inflation.

According to the 2001 survey by the Bureau of  Market  Research,  households
in the Cape Metropolitan area with an income of less than R1 600  per  month
spend almost 46% of their income on food in comparison  to  the  top  income
group. Those earning more than R11 600 per month spend one eighth,  that  is
12%, of their money on food. These patterns are  likely  to  be  similar  in
other parts of the country.

The space for manoeuvrability is extremely limited for the  poorest  of  the
poor of our society. The more one spends on food, the less one  is  able  to
pay for housing, transport  and  medical  care,  let  alone  for  education,
clothing and other necessities. If one  has  already  spent  half  of  one's
income  on  food,  the  challenge  to  make  ends  meet  is  even   greater.
Ironically, the burden of the rapidly increasing food prices  is  felt  most
severely in the poorer provinces where this is least affordable.

Whereas the food price index increases for Gauteng  and  Western  Cape  were
over 18% for the last 12 months, it was almost 28% in the Eastern Cape,  26%
in KwaZulu-Natal and 20% in Limpopo.

Regrettably, it is not simple to control prices. This is  not  the  role  of
the Government. What the Government  can  do  is  to  appeal  to  producers,
wholesalers and retailers to limit their profit  margins,  and  to  minimise
the passing of increased costs to  consumers,  especially  in  the  case  of
basic staple foods.

We are extremely grateful for  the  gestures  by  some  large  retailers  to
donate bags of mieliemeal or to subsidise the consumer price thereof  for  a
limited period. Others are urged to follow the example, if at all  possible.


Additionally, the severe shortage in neighbouring countries has  meant  that
more of our food is being sold to our neighbours, thereby  decreasing  local
domestic supply and inflating prices  that  are  asked  domestically.  [Time

Prof L M MBADI: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  the  primary
task of Parliament, in its effort to alleviate poverty,  is  to  fulfil  its
watch-dog responsibility and ensure proper oversight over the activities  of
Government.

Every year, Parliament scrutinises Budget Votes presented to it  by  various
Ministers, and approves them. The pertinent  question  may  well  be  asked:
Does the money voted for poverty alleviation reach its targets, namely,  the
poorest of the poor? It was this Parliament that  passed  a  law  permitting
gambling in the country and established the national lottery.
The Sunday Times of 27 October 2002 has revealed that  R372m  earmarked  for
the defunct RDP fund and national disasters was not disbursed. Why was  this
money not used for natural disasters in the  Cape  or  to  feed  desperately
poor and hungry children in the North Eastern Cape? Parliament must  request
the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Trade and Industry to appoint  a
proper agency to distribute these funds.

Parliament  appreciates  the  efforts  made  by  the  Minister   of   Social
Development to rope in organised business to  lend  a  hand  in  alleviating
poverty. Consequently, Jonnic Publishing, Tiger rands, Pick & Pay  and  Absa
made firm commitments towards the Minister's initiative.

At the same event,  Absa  and  the  National  Development  Agency  signed  a
memorandum of understanding. Absa  donated  R1m,  as  the  first  phase,  to
conduct research into the needs of the poor, disabled as well as  women  and
children.

Sibamba ngazo zozibini, krec' izulu. Akasekho kwalapha. [We thank you,  tall
man. Oh! He has gone already.]

The community-based public works programme is  a  focused  job-creation  and
poverty-relief programme targeted primarily at the rural poor and funded  by
the Poverty Relief Fund appropriated  by  this  Parliament.  Its  objectives
include creating both temporary  and  sustainable  employment  opportunities
through the short public works projects and by  facilitating  micro-business
opportunities associated with the community assets created.

The focus of the community-based  public  works  programme  is  to  identify
clusters  of  projects  within   identified   poverty   pockets   in   rural
communities.   Such   communities   are   characterised   by   a   lack   of
infrastructure,  a  lack  of  skills  and  weak  institutional  support  for
development.

It  is  the  responsibility  of  public  representatives  to  establish  the
physical existence of the projects and to continuously monitor and  evaluate
them. They must ensure that the minimum  targets  for  employing  particular
groups are observed, namely, local labour, 30%, women,  50%,  young  people,
15%, and the disabled 1,5%.

The Independent Development Trust is a public institution set up to  support
Government to meet its development goals. It is  partly  funded  from  money
appropriated by this Parliament for poverty relief to  the  National  Public
Works Programme. In addition to the funds received from  Public  Works,  the
IDT receives transfer payments from other  government  departments  and  the
private sector.

Amalungu ePalamente mawazigqale  ezi  mali,  azibone  okokuba  zisetyenziswa
ngendlela eyiyo kusini na. Baninzi oohlohl' esakhe  phandl'  apha.  [Laphela
ixesha.] [Members of  Parliament  should  note  that  these  funds  are  not
misused. There are a lot of fatcats out there. [Time expired.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Before  I  recognise  the  next
speaker, hon members, I think  you  are  having  by  far  too  many  private
discussions. May I please call you to order.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Mr Chairperson,  the  recent  conference  in  Gauteng  on
poverty comprised mostly of parliamentarians. This is an example of how  far
removed Parliament is from the people. The  conference  programme  does  not
indicate a speaker from the poor community. This is normally the  case  with
poverty-related conferences - the voice of the poor is normally  carried  by
the outsider while those in poverty have to look on.

The Bible says that the poor we shall always have with us. We need to  steer
away from the belief that the poor cannot fend for themselves.  However,  it
is our collective responsibility to ensure that, despite their  impoverished
situation, they live a life with dignity and respect.

Economic growth can no longer be perceived as the only  key  factor  in  the
fight   against   poverty.   Factors   like   political   stability,   moral
regeneration, skills development, good health,  secure  environment  and  an
acceptable level of social services are equally important. The  sad  reality
is that, even though a large portion of our Budget is allocated  to  address
the social problems within our community, we have 37% of our  people  living
in abject poverty and 75% of people who do not have access to basic food.

The social welfare programme has not helped to eradicate poverty because  of
poor services. Rather, it  is  not  reaching  the  people.  Each  member  of
Parliament has a social responsibility to take  these  programmes  to  their
constituencies and enquire where we can improve. The church and other  civil
organisations are the appropriate institutions that  can  deliver  effective
services to the communities, and I think Government needs to look at  making
more tax concessions to these organisations.

South Africa has a Charter for Mining, a Charter for Moral  Regeneration  in
the making, and we have a Freedom Charter. The ACDP is  in  the  process  of
completing a charter on poverty alleviation. The approach we have  taken  is
not top-down neither bottom-up, but we are networking with organisations  in
the community.

When I visit my constituencies, the sight of the appalling  poverty-stricken
conditions many of our citizens live in,  is  heart-breaking.  Many  of  our
senior citizens do not enjoy the benefits of their  pension,  as  all  their
money has to go towards sustaining an entire family. Many of  them  ask  the
question: why is Government so quick  to  feed  our  neighbouring  countries
when their very own citizens are dying  of  starvation?  The  ACDP  believes
that Government needs first to see to the well-being  of  its  own  citizens
and then embark on being the bread basket of Africa, which we encourage.

The ACDP has embarked on a nutritional programme in a few schools,  as  many
of our children do not even have a nutritional meal for a day. Some of  them
have been at school for three  days  without  eating  and  I  am  very  much
involved, hands-on. The present feeding scheme is inadequate  as  17  loaves
of bread to feed 530 children is not enough, 25 loaves of bread to feed  820
is also not enough, and now they are also actually decreasing the amount.

Many children do not even want to go on  school  holidays.  Do  hon  members
know why? Because they say they would rather  stay  at  school  because,  at
least, the lucky ones get a slice of bread. How do we  expect  our  children
to develop and achieve academic success when they go hungry?

The ACDP proposes that Government review the feeding scheme and introduce  a
sustainable nutritional  programme  at  schools  in  poverty-stricken  areas
where all children would be able to get at  least  one  nutritional  meal  a
day; that Government introduces  foodstamps  and  introduces  a  charter  on
poverty alleviation. It is time for MPs to get their  hands  dirty  and  get
involved in their constituencies. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members,  we  have  a  long
day and I would like you to  keep  to  your  time.  All  the  overruns  will
actually add up in the end.
Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Mr Chairperson, to the hon member from the ACDP,  I  would
like to say: love thy neighbour as you love yourself. Do not complain  about
our neighbouring countries.

During the state of the nation address in February this year, the  President
reaffirmed the centrality of the legacy of poverty and  underdevelopment  to
the restructuring  and  development  of  South  Africa,  and  he  said  that
eradicating poverty is the single biggest challenge in South Africa.

Poverty is always seen within the context of economic development. It  is  a
complex issue. It is seen in a mechanical perception as a  lack  of  income,
but income alone is not a valid measurement for poverty. Poverty has a  much
wider definition, and it  is  also  regarded  as  deprivation  in  terms  of
lacking or having insufficient access to resources or the inability to  meet
basic  needs.  In  a  cultural  perspective,  poverty  can  be  regarded  as
isolation, loss of direction, hopelessness, apathy and passive suffering.

It would therefore be correct  to  locate  this  debate  within  its  proper
context, that  sustainable  livelihood  and  employment  creation  in  South
Africa should be a prerequisite for formulating a  strategic  programme  for
poverty eradication  and  full  employment.  Our  role  as  Parliament  then
becomes centrally driven within such  a  strategic  programme,  a  strategic
programme which derives from mainstreaming poverty reduction  into  national
policy-making in addition to adopting a proper growth strategy.

It is therefore then correct that  the  ANC-led  Government  has  chosen  to
invest in  the  economy  through  public  works  programmes,  education  and
training  programmes  and  other  social  investments  as  an  approach   to
eliminating the social backlogs, job creation and economic  growth  and  the
choice to do all of this in clusters in Cabinet. Key to the pro-poor  growth
strategy remains Parliament ensuring a pro-poor fiscal, monetary, trade  and
industry, and an agricultural policy.

Regarding fiscal policy, on Tuesday, we were  afforded  the  opportunity  to
hear  what  the  Minister  of  Finance  was  putting  in   his   Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework. He told us that, in the MTEF, the  prioritisation  of
Government expenditure - he alluded to this on Tuesday - was on a  range  of
topics. But,  importantly,  the  first  one,  he  said,  should  be  poverty
reduction  and  development;  addressing  the  needs  of  vulnerable  groups
through extending social assistance, health  and  education;  expanding  the
capacity in the safety and security sector; accelerating  land  reforms  and
restitution; increasing support for research  and  development  so  that  we
continue to see where the poverty levels are in this country,  and  a  range
of other things. All of  these  will  allow  and  enable  us  to  achieve  a
promotion  in  productivity  and  investment.  These  increase  our  ability
towards achieving social and political stability in the country and all  the
encompassed processes.

Around the  monetary  policy  issue,  the  ANC  policy  conference  recently
emerged with a very important decision that monetary policy must be used  in
a very flexible manner that should be consistent with  the  broad  aims  and
objectives of the ANC economic policy, including  job  creation,  investment
and poverty eradication and that, very  importantly,  monetary  policy  must
continue  to  be  directed  towards  the  achievement  and  maintenance   of
macroeconomic stability, and it should be in  the  interest  of  sustainable
economic  growth.  [Interjections.]  It  should  be  able  to  maintain  our
approach on inflation targeting while ensuring that targets  are  consistent
with our economic objectives, and that all role-players in the economy  play
their role in pursuing low inflation and, in the  above  regard,  strive  to
achieve broad consensus on inflation targets.

With regard to trade and industry policy, I want to take the opportunity  to
congratulate the South African Clothing and Textile Worker's Union  for  the
initiative that they are taking in this province today to lift the  clothing
industry out of the level in which it was by putting together a  partnership
with all the role-players that we have in the Western Cape. There is no  way
that we would have had such a partnership in the Western Cape  if  we  still
had a DA government.

Our role as MPs in this  area  has  and  should  continue  to  be  that  the
industrial policy gives  high  productivity.  Again,  therefore,  a  correct
decision was taken at the policy conference on a range of  issues  regarding
which Government, at all levels, should embark on a programme that  combines
short-term measures aimed at providing a degree  of  immediate  relief  with
longer-term interventions aimed at sustainable job creation and  alternative
income-earning opportunities. There is a range of very  good  measures,  but
time does not allow me to go through them.

With regard to agricultural policy, we come up with alternatives, again,  to
alleviate poverty and, here again, a  co-operative  movement  would  support
more equitable growth and ownership in our economy and,  in  doing  so,  our
people will be empowered. This will provide important services  which  would
be more affordable  and  efficient  to  particularly  poor  households;  the
current legislative framework for co-operatives  is  about  encouraging  the
formation  of  small-scale  producer  co-ops   and   to   co-opt   financial
institutions or consumer co-ops.

I have argued that a pro-poor growth  strategy  should  be  mainstreamed  to
eradicate poverty and unemployment and ensure that the executive  follow  up
on this and that members of Parliament then play a role in making sure  that
these programmes do come to the different communities.

It is therefore obvious  that  Parliament's  budget  should  be  aligned  to
enable  members  of  Parliament  to  implement,  inside   and   outside   of
Parliament, such a growth strategy in our oversight, in our public  hearings
and when visiting our constituencies. I cannot help but say  that  in  doing
so - I want to make a call - we are doing so as a form of  partnership,  the
form of partnership that we have seen emerging since the  beginning  of  the
year when we started the Letsima campaign and that we call upon  our  people
to form partnerships  and  show  a  new  patriotism  in  addressing  poverty
alleviation, one which will  unite  ourselves  as  a  country  against  this
common enemy. [Applause.]

Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson and hon members, a healthy society  is  a  mirror
that reflects the attitude of  its  government  officials  towards  its  own
citizens. Our country cannot claim to be  free  when  the  majority  of  its
citizens are dying  of  poverty.  What  role  can  members  as  politicians,
indeed, parliamentarians, play  in  addressing  the  challenge  of  poverty?
There is no doubt that people expect  members  to  do  something  about  the
state of poverty in our country. There is a general feeling  amongst  people
that we, as parliamentarians,do not care a hoot about their plight.

The tag attached to parliamentarians is that of  them  being  on  the  gravy
train whilst the  people  are  struggling.  Such  a  perception  has  to  be
corrected. We need to demonstrate to people that  we  care.  It  has  to  be
emphasised that parliamentarians can make a difference in fighting  poverty,
as they are strategically  positioned  to  direct  government  resources  in
whatever way necessary to  implement  poverty  alleviation  programmes.  How
involved are members with their local communities in fighting poverty  at  a
constituency level as the people's representatives? Do we use these  periods
as a holiday or to pursue party politics? This is  an  opportunity  that  we
can all use to work with nongovernmental organisations and other members  of
the community to assist them to access government help in that regard.

As parliamentarians, we need to devise ways and means  of  promoting  public
and private  sector  partnerships  in  fighting  poverty.  In  this  regard,
parliamentarians are challenged to set up a poverty alleviation  trust  fund
that   brings    together    business,    non-profit    organisations    and
parliamentarians. The envisaged association will enable parliamentarians  to
work  together  irrespective  of  their  party  affiliation  and  contribute
meaningfully and directly to poverty alleviation programmes [Time expired].

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, Parliament has legislative  responsibilities  to
make laws  that  regulate  the  lives  of  all  people.  Our  Parliament  is
handicapped in one area, namely,  not  having  constituency  structures  and
therefore direct links with people  it  purports  to  represent.  In  normal
democratic parliaments, members of parliament  coming  from  a  constituency
give regular reports to their constituents.

The basic function of Parliament in our system is to regulate life and  curb
excesses of greed and capitalism. The regulation cannot happen on  its  own.
It is the responsibility of Government to set the parameters  of  individual
freedom and responsibilities. Our country is large  enough  to  contain  and
maintain all of us. We do not have to resort to bombs, as  in  the  case  of
the madness of killing innocent citizens in Soweto. One of the  major  tasks
for Parliament in post-apartheid South Africa is to emphasise the  ethic  of
sharing. This is the opposite of what obtained in  our  country  before  the
democratic dispensation.

We live in a society that has  shocking  inequalities  between  Sandton  and
Alexandra, Newlands and Crossroads, and  between  Umhlanga  Rocks  and  Cato
Manor. We live in a society where one section lives in  large  houses  while
others live in cardboard houses. One group has wardrobes whose railings  are
falling down because of the clothes they have on them while the other  group
has few clothes. In fact, some people have no  wardrobes  or  railings;  all
their possessions or clothing are kept in a paper bag.

One cardinal of the church observed that clothes and shoes that  we  do  not
use do not belong to us but to those  who  are  half-naked  and  barefooted.
Parliament must help create jobs, give a living  grant  to  those  who  earn
nothing  and  are  hungry.  Parliament  must  speed  up  development.  [Time
expired].

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, poverty is one of the most  horrible  problems
that South African society is  faced  with.  Unemployment,  the  effects  of
apartheid and many other factors contribute to this.

Though it is extremely important to locate the source of  the  problem,  the
reality of our situation is that poverty is a major problem  and  one  needs
to address it  earnestly.  Government  programmes  and  policies  have  been
instituted  for  the  earnest  alleviation  of   poverty   and   sustainable
development of the country. With many policies in place, there  has  been  a
degree of relief in terms of poverty alleviation.

The national lottery has also tried to alleviate the problem,  but  that  is
not enough. The involvement of all sectors  should  serve  as  the  greatest
source of alleviation. Statistics scare us  to  the  degree  that  we  often
refuse  to  listen.  Media  coverage  has  sent  shockwaves  throughout  the
affluent homes in South Africa  regarding  the  reality  that  South  Africa
might be a  free  country,  but  that  many  of  its  people  are  dying  of
starvation. The MF is pleased, though, to note the  earnest  involvement  of
the public and private sectors in fighting poverty.

We  as  parliamentarians  can  also  make  a  great  contribution.   Poverty
alleviation fairs and other means of addressing and  bringing  to  the  fore
the growing problem would help a lot in  highlighting  the  reality  of  the
situation, and lead to greater assistance.

There  are  a  number  of  ways  in  which  we,   including   the   MF,   as
parliamentarians, can contribute to poverty alleviation. [Applause.]

Mr  P  J  NEFOLOVHODWE:  Chairperson,  during  the  past  three  development
decades,  numerous  development  and  upliftment  models,   programmes   and
strategies have been proposed in order to eliminate poverty. Each  of  these
models defines poverty alleviation in its own  way,  including  the  process
whereby it could be achieved.

The most familiar models have been those of  economic  growth,  growth  with
distribution, the new international economic order and  the  production  for
basic needs and various forms of self-reliance.

Azapo believes that most of these  models  miss  the  point,  in  that  they
proceed from the premise that society should engage in poverty  alleviation,
instead of poverty eradication. Further, most models of poverty  alleviation
have taken for granted that economic growth leads automatically to  economic
transformation and the advancement of the poor in society.

From the  perspective  of  Azapo,  poverty  should  not  be  alleviated  but
eradicated through  development.  These  developments  should  lead  to  the
equitable growth in the poor's personal and collective capacities  in  order
for them to determine their own destiny.

The role of Parliament under these circumstances is to legislate in  such  a
way that resources are  directed  at  changing  the  material  circumstances
under which the poor live. The approach should be to put  the  poor  at  the
centre stage, with  the  priority  being  the  poor's  ongoing  struggle  to
improve their circumstances. [Time expired.]

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Chairperson, when dealing with issues relating to  poverty
alleviation, it  is  appropriate  to  define  what  is  meant  by  the  term
"poverty". There are two types of  poverty,  namely  absolute  and  relative
poverty. Both are applicable to this debate,  as  many  in  society  and  in
Government confuse  the  issues.  The  World  Bank  defines  poverty  as  "a
situation where  incomes  are  so  low  that  even  a  minimum  standard  of
nutrition, shelter and personal necessities cannot be maintained."

On the other hand, relative poverty is an expression of poverty in  relation
to something else. For example, in relation to Lesotho or  Swaziland,  South
Africa may seem not so poor. These terms are important  because  many  South
Africans live with the illusion that South Africa is a rich  country,  while
in reality many people in the country do not  know  where  their  next  meal
will come from. In real terms, food prices are  spiralling  out  of  control
and people are starting to die.

The 1996 census  indicated  that  52%  of  South  Africans  were  living  in
poverty. Any person who works and travels in rural South Africa can see  the
day-to-day deterioration in the quality of  people's  lives.  Although  even
employed people have been known to live  in  poverty,  unemployment  remains
the basic cause of poverty. In South Africa, unemployment has  increased  to
the extent that although the official figure may be 37%, it is  reported  to
be as high as 88% in some rural areas.

South Africa has an abundance  of  human  and  natural  resources.  What  is
lacking, however, is direct foreign investment to  convert  this  into  real
economic development. This  investment  depends  on  a  number  of  factors,
including a sound economic and fiscal  basis  that  may  stimulate  economic
growth and produce confidence among investors. Second, we need a secure  and
safe environment for investment of capital. The high rate of crime in  South
Africa is not conducive to investment.

Third, we need a well-educated and healthy society. Our  country  is  losing
many of our most skilled people who could play a vital role in the  economic
development of this country. At the  same  time,  our  most  vital  economic
asset, our young people, are dying of Aids.

Fourth,  in  an  era  of  globalisation,  regional  stability  will   be   a
determining factor in a country's economic  development.  In  this  respect,
South Africa's ad hoc approach to problems relating to regional  development
has much room for improvement. While Zimbabwe ruins its  economy  and  sends
the region into mass starvation, South Africa opts for silent diplomacy.

This brings me to the fifth point about leadership. A  transitional  society
requires bold leadership  and  vision.  Leadership  requires  not  only  the
courage and political will to take principled decisions and stick  to  them,
but also the ability to admit mistakes and implement remedial action.

In this respect, the  current  Government  is  failing  the  people  of  our
country and the people of the region. We as a  Parliament  are  not  holding
them to account.

Poverty alleviation in South Africa is not going to be easy  to  deal  with,
especially as both absolute and relative poverty are both aspects that  have
the potential to cause a great deal of economic and,  ultimately,  political
instability in South Africa and the  region.  We  have  in  our  country  an
economic elite that can afford to live secluded from the  rest  of  society,
and where it is easy to say: We are a rich country. On the  other  hand,  we
have the majority of our people living on  the  other  side  of  the  fence,
vulnerable, in shacks, and unsure where their next meal will come from.

I would like to use the following illustration to indicate  the  frustration
of many South Africans. A South African woman was quoted as  saying,  during
a case study for the book: Uprooting Poverty: The South  African  Challenge,
and I quote:


  Sometimes the children lie awake at night. I know that they are hungry. I
  feel like feeding them rattex. When your children  cry  hunger-cry,  your
  heart wants to break. It would be better if they were dead. When I  think
  of like things like that I feel worse. I am sick.


  I cannot take my children to the doctor when they are sick because  there
  is no money. What can one do? You must start looking. You must also  pray
  to God that He will keep you from killing your children.

[Interjections.]

For the sake of our future, we will have to be honest and principled in  our
approach to poverty alleviation. With this in mind, politicians may  not  be
the best people to tackle the issue. Unfortunately, however, the reality  is
that politicians will have to produce policies and programmes to  deal  with
poverty. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Nkskz C I GCINA: Mhlalingaphambili,  ndiyalelwe  ukuba  ndithethe  ngendlala
nangendlela  esingathi  siyilwe  ngayo.  Okubalulekileyo   kukuba   kufuneka
sisebenzisane  nooceba  ukuze  sikwazi  ukuyilwa  iphele  indlala   phakathi
kwabantu bethu.

Abantu kufuneka ukuba nabo baphakame bancedisane noRhulumente.  Abona  bantu
bahleleleke kakhulu ngabo basemaphandleni. Eyona nto ifunekayo ...

... Enye into endingayikhuthaziyo kukuphiwa kwabantu iipasile  zokutya  kuba
abasokuze bakwazi ukuzenzela nto.  Kufuneka  baphakame  balime  izitiya,  ze
thina  sibadibanise  nabezolimo  ukuze  bafumane  amasimi,  bafuye   iinkuku
neehagu. Siyabacela abantu ukuba bazenze ezi zinto.

URhulumente wenza konke ekusemandleni  kuba  uyayithumela  imali  kumaphondo
ethu,  ukuzama   ukuphelisa   indlala,   ntonje   akanamncedisi   kwinqanaba
elisezantsi. Kudala yabakho indlala,  kwakurhulumente  wangaphambili.  Thina
bantu abazalelwe ezilokishini kudala sisokola, imisebenzi ingekho.

Phaya eBhayi, ngexa kwakuphakama abafundi ngonyaka ka-1976 iindawo  ezininzi
ezinjengemizimveliso   yezithuthi   neminye   zavala.    Namhlanje    akukho
mizimveliso ngaphandle  nje  kweendawo  ezimbalwa  zokwenza  iimoto.  Abantu
abaninzi  abaphangeli  ukususela  oko  kwavalwa  loo  mizimveliso,   bamkela
indodla.  Bayaqala  ukufumana   izindlu   ngezi   baziphiwe   nguRhulumente,
kubandakanywa umbane, amanzi acocekileyo nonyango.

Ngenxa yabantu abaninzi abangaphangeliyo, uRhulumente  ukhupha  imali  khon'
ukuze  kuqhutywe  amaphulo  okuqeqesha  abantu  ukuze  bakwazi  ukuziphilela
ngokuzisebenzela kuba abanakho ukufumana imisebenzi bonke.

Thina  sakhelwa  ngurhulumente  wangaphambili  izindlu  ezimagumbi   mabini,
sizirenta.  Zazingafulelwanga  ngaphakathi  zingenawo  nomgangatho.  Izindlu
zangasese  zazingemva  zinamabhakethi.  Sasingenawo  nombane  kwezo  zindlu.
Wayesithi ubani akuswelekelwa  ngumyeni  ze  angcwatywe  ngoMgqibelo  okanye
ngeCawe, ngoMvulo wayekhutshwa kuthiwe makahambe  aye  kufuna  indoda  ukuze
atshate kuba akanalungelo lokuhlala endlwini engenamyeni.

Ukuba ubani unonyana ophangelayo, yayithatyathwa indlu yakhe  inikwe  unyana
wakhe ze  athi  akutshata  loo  nyana  umolokazana  akukhuphele  ngaphandle.
Nokuba  ubani  ukhulelwe  okanye  unomntwana  omncinci,   wayekhutshwa   qha
endlwini.

Kufuneka abantu bethu bakhumbule apho basuka khona.  Sisuka  phi,  besihleli
njani ngaphambili? Namhlanje abantu bagxoga lo Rhulumente uzamayo  ngamatye.
Abantu   abakuRhulumente   abahlali   neentsapho   zabo.   Banyuka   besihla
besebenzela abantu.

Kufuneka siphakame sonke sincedisane  nooceba  kwakunye  noRhulumente  ukuze
siyilwe iphele le ndlala  igqubayo  phakathi  kwabantu  bethu,  ndlala  leyo
ingaqali  namhlanje.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation   of   Xhosa   paragraphs
follows.)

[Mrs C I GCINA: Chairperson, I have been instructed  to  talk  about  hunger
and poverty, and about the way we could fight them.  What  is  important  is
that we should work together with councillors so that we  could  succeed  in
fighting poverty among our people.

People should stand up and work together with the  Government.  The  poorest
of the poor are people  living  in  rural  areas.  What  is  needed  is  ...
[Inaudible.]

I also do not encourage the handing out of food parcels  because  I  believe
that people will never be able to do  things  for  themselves.  They  should
start up gardens and then we will introduce them  to  those  who  deal  with
agricultural matters so that they could get  ploughing  fields,  they  could
farm in poultry and pigs. We humbly ask  people  to  do  these  things.  The
Government is doing all in its power because  they  allocate  funds  to  our
provinces to try to fight poverty but the problem persists because there  is
no assistance from the lower  level.  Poverty  has  long  been  around  even
during the previous government. We, people who were born in townships,  have
long been suffering  without  jobs.  In  Port  Elizabeth,  during  students'
uprisings in 1976, many places of  employment  like  car  manufacturers  and
others closed down. There are no more factories  around  except  for  a  few
motor industries. Many people are unemployed  and  receive  pension  grants.
For the first time in their lives they own houses  that  were  provided  for
them by this Government, including  electricity,  clean  water  and  medical
care.

Because of high levels of unemployment, the Government has  allocated  funds
to assist in the setting up  of  training  programmes  so  that  they  could
provide for themselves because not everybody can get be  formally  employed.
The previous government built us two-roomed houses that we rented. They  did
not have ceilings or flooring. We used the bucket system of toilets. We  did
not have electricity in those  houses.  When  one's  husband  died  and  was
buried on a Saturday or Sunday, on Monday she would be told to go  and  find
a man who would be willing to marry her, as she would lose  the  house  when
she did not have a man. If one had a son who was working,  the  house  would
be given to him and when gets married, the daughter-in-law  would  have  the
right to drive her out of the house.
Our  people  should  always  remember  where  we  come  from.  What  is  our
background? How did we live before? Today we find people throwing stones  at
this Government while it is doing all it  can.  People  who  serve  in  this
Government do not live with their families. They  are  all  over  the  place
working for people. We  need  to  stand  up  and  help  councilors  and  the
Government so that we could fight poverty that is so rampant among  us,  and
which has always existed. [Applause.]]

Mnr J J NIEMANN: Mnr die Voorsitter, in die drie minute wat ek het,  wil  ek
drie voorstelle doen wat die Regering moet uitvoer om  armoedverligting  aan
honderdduisende mense te bring.

Hierdie Regering diskrimineer tussen 'n vrou wat  vir  'n  ouderdomspensioen
kwalifiseer op die ouderdom van 60, en 'n man wat 'n sogenaamde  broodwinner
is,  maar  wat  eers  op  die  ouderdom  van  65  vir  'n  ouderdomspensioen
kwalifiseer. Dit is diskriminasie tussen manlik en  vroulik  in  die  ergste
graad. Dit is ook 'n oortreding van die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet.  Hier  sit
'n paar Ministers - die hele Kabinet sit hier - wat die  saak  dadelik  moet
regstel indien armoedverligting hul  erns  is.  Bring  armoedverligting  aan
honderdduisende mans wat tans  werkloos  is  en  onder  die  bestaansminimum
leef. Dit is 'n skandalige weerhouding van  pensioen  van  die  armstes  van
armes. Die Regering behoort nie net  die  skandalige  diskriminasie  dadelik
reg te stel nie, maar behoort 'n regstellende,  terugwerkende  terugbetaling
te doen aan alle mans wat reeds die ouderdom van 60 bereik het.

Tweedens, net soos die eerste voorstel, het die Nuwe NP  in  die  Noord-Kaap
al jare gelede  ál  drie  dié  voorstelle  vir  armoedverligting  as  beleid
aanvaar. Tans word kindertoelae betaal  van  die  geboorte  af  tot  op  die
ouderdom  van  sewe  jaar.  Nou  is  daar  sprake  dat  die   Regering   die
ouderdomsperk gaan opskuif tot 14 jaar. Dan is die kind in graad 7,  en  vat
die Regering die kindertoelae weg.  Nee,  nee!  Die  Nuwe  NP  sê,  gee  die
kindertoelaag die dag wanneer die kind  toegelaat  word  tot  die  skool  en
totdat hy of sy die skool permanent verlaat. Die eerste  18  maande  kry  'n
kind die kragtigste voedsel wat 'n kind maar kan kry,  naamlik  moedersmelk.
Die behoefte van 'n kind tot en met die ouderdom van sewe is baie minder  as
wanneer die kind begin skoolgaan. Elke  jaar  op  skool  word  die  eise  en
behoeftes van die kind groter en groter. Die Regering vat die  kindertoelaag
weg juis wannneer die kind dit die nodigste het.  Dit  dra  by  tot  verdere
verarming van die armes.

Derdens stel die Nuwe NP voor dat waar albei ouers meens  vigs  gesterf  het
en daar nie 'n voog of 'n pleegouer is wat na die kinders  omsien  nie,  die
Regering sorgafhanklikheidstoelae by wyse van kos- en klerekoepons  aan  die
kind moet betaal wat die funksie van die  huishouding  oorgeneem  het.  Tans
word daardie wesies aan die genade van die gemeenskap oorgelaat,  wat  bydra
tot verdere verarming. Die staat versuim sy  plig  teenoor  die  armes.  Die
ergste is dat die ANC-Regering se leuse is: ``A better life for  all''.  Dit
is  niks  anders  as  galgehumor  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   speech
follows.)

[Mr J J NIEMANN: Mr Chairperson, in the three minutes at my disposal I  want
to make three proposals, which the Government must  implement  in  order  to
bring poverty relief to hundreds of thousands of people.

This Government is discriminating between a woman,  who  qualifies  for  old
age pension at the age of 60, and a man who is  the  so-called  breadwinner,
but who only qualifies for old age  pension  at  the  age  of  65.  This  is
discriminatin to the worst degree between male and  female.  It  is  also  a
transgression of the South African Constitution. There are a  few  Ministers
sitting here - the whole Cabinet is here  -  who  must  immediately  rectify
this matter if they are serious about poverty relief. Bring  poverty  relief
to hundreds of thousands of men who are currently unemployed, living on  the
breadline. This ia a scandalous restraint of pension for the poorest of  the
poor. Government should  not  only  rectify  the  scandalous  discrimination
immediately, but should effect a  corrective,  backdated  repayment  to  all
males who have already reached the age of 60.
Secondly, as with the first proposal, several years ago the Northern  Cape's
New NP had already taken up as  policy  all  three  of  these  proposals  on
poverty relief. Currently child grants are being paid from birth to the  age
of seven years. Now there is talk that the  Government  will  move  the  age
restriction up to 14 years. The child will then  be  in  grade  7  when  the
Government takes away the child grant. No,no! The  New  NP  says,  give  the
child rebate from the day the child enters the school until the  day  he  or
she permanently leaves there. In the first 18 months the child receives  the
most potent food any child can get, namely mother's milk.  The  needs  of  a
child up to the age of seven are far less than those  of  a  child  that  is
starting with school. Each year at school the requirements and needs of  the
child grow and grow. The Government is removing the child  grant  just  when
the child needs it the most. This contributes to the further improvement  of
the poor.

Thirdly, the New NP proposes that when both parents have died  of  Aids  and
there are no guardians or foster parents to look  after  the  children,  the
Government must pay the care dependency grant by way of  food  and  clothing
coupons to the child who has taken over the running  of  the  household.  At
present, those orphans are being left to the mercy of the  community,  which
adds to further impoverishment. The state is remiss in its duty towards  the
poor. The worst is that the ANC Government's slogan is: "A better  life  for
all". That is nothing less than gallows humour.]

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Mr Chairperson, what really surprised me as I  was
listening to the debate is  that  when  people's  lives  improve,  some  hon
members in this House get threatened. The question is:  Why?  The  advantage
that some of us have is that we are drawn from  poverty.  We  did  not  read
about it in books or see pictures of children who do not have food. We  were
those children ourselves. [Interjections.]

I stand here as a proud South African who can pride myself on being part  of
a group of hon members who have changed the lives  of  many  South  Africans
for the better in less than a decade. Their lives could not have  been  what
they are today had it  not  been  for  this  Parliament.  South  Africa  was
isolated from the rest of the world but what we did since  1994  was  mainly
to restore pride and confidence  in  our  fellow  South  Africans.  We  also
succeeded in putting South Africa back to where she belongs  in  the  global
community.

With regard to the rest of the world,  including  our  mother  continent  of
Africa, we can state this without any fear of contradiction  that,  in  less
than  one  decade,  we  have  transformed  our   country   from   being   an
international pariah, a  negative  force  in  favour  of  racism,  reaction,
destabilisation, aggression and war to  an  important  international  player
for democracy,  social  progress,  national  independence  and  quality  and
peace.  These  words  were  said  by  President  Mbeki  at  the  ANC  policy
conference last month. We have engaged the Government's  poverty-alleviation
programme to make sure that the enabling legislation we pass in  this  House
reaches the intended targets in making life worthwhile for our people.
As I speak here today, there are more than 4 million visitors  who  came  to
our country in the first seven months of this  year.  Needless  to  mention,
there are jobs that these visits create. The rate of  the  creation  of  new
SMMEs in this industry all the time is also growing.

Minister Moosa expressed his delight that South  Africa  continues  to  defy
gravity when measured against the global tourism scene. South Africa is  one
of the best performing tourism destinations in the  world,  thanks  to  this
august House for the Tourism Amendment Act, which empowers local people  who
were  historically  disadvantaged  and  previously  isolated  in  their  own
country to see themselves as equal  partners  and  not  as  servants,  while
other people enjoy their lives. A  lot  still  needs  to  be  done  in  this
regard.

We will spare no effort to free  our  fellowmen,  women  and  children  from
abject and dehumanising conditions of extreme poverty to which more  than  a
billion of them are currently subjected. We are committed to make the  right
development a reality for everyone and to  freeing  the  entire  human  race
from want.

On 15 September last year, the procurement management of the  Department  of
Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  advertised  in  the  local  newspapers
inviting prospective services and equipment suppliers to register  as  SMMEs
and BEE on an accredited departmental database.

I am more than proud  to  work  with  Minister  Moosa  and  Deputy  Minister
Mabudafhasi, who took a decision to use SMMEs at all times for all  services
needed  by  the  Department.  Tomorrow,  the  Deputy  Minister  will  launch
November as an environmental month in KwaZulu-Natal.  The  local  women  are
excited because they and nobody else are charged with the logistics of  this
big occasion. Well done, comrades! Keep it up!  The  Minister  is  in  India
attending a meeting on climate change and the Deputy Minister is  acting  as
Minister. Obviously, I understand why they are not here. They deserve a  big
hand for that. [Applause.]

The  parliamentary  committee   on   environmental   affairs   and   tourism
scrutinised the department on their criteria  for  poverty  relief  projects
and are happy that, from this exercise, at least  600  suppliers  have  been
successfully registered - more than 247 BEE have been incorporated  as  part
of  transformation  in  an  effort  to  support  black  business,  Thlala  e
Mokosing. The portfolio committee insists that there should be  rotation  of
suppliers on a regular basis to give  equal  opportunities  for  BEE  to  be
transparent, equitable and effective in terms of the Constitution  and  keep
reliable data that will be updated from time to time.

The annual tourism indaba this year proved that disadvantaged people have  a
say in their country. They exhibited in Durban and some  of  them,  for  the
first time ever, will be at the World Travel Market  in  London  later  this
month to exhibit. They will be exhibiting alongside other  countries  and  I
am very happy to mention that members of this  august  House  -  Ramotsamai,
Mbuyazi, Moss and Kalako - were in Durban to  ensure  participation  of  the
SMMEs at the indaba.

I do not know what empowerment would be if this is not empowerment but I  am
sure that the hon Sono would be able to tell me. [Interjections.]

Ka Sesotho ba re "ke sono". Sono ke sono [Interjections.] [In  Sesotho  they
say: Oh, what a pity! It's a pity.]

We continue to say - the hon brother Joe does not know what it means -  that
we are now world players in tourism, and, as we do  so,  we  carry  with  us
lots of South Africans. We usher in hope to the youth of this  country  that
their future resources are in safe hands.

Another area where we have performed well is by calling for public  hearings
in respect of the  adoption  of  the  Legal  Resources  Management  Act.  We
radically changed what we inherited, which  was  a  mess  indeed.  Today  we
speak of  fewer  and  fewer  paper  quota  holders  who  have,  through  the
department, dedicated an allocations unit with the capacity  to  verify  all
the applications for fishing and  to  allocate  the  resource  in  terms  of
measurable criteria and conditions. After the adoption of this Act,  we  saw
hundreds of fishermen who marched  to  Parliament  to  thank  the  Minister.
Where else in the world does one experience that?

The issue of long-term rights, an issue debated  by  hon  members,  for  all
species will definitely boost confidence in the industry, especially to  new
entrants, the poorest of the poor who can now acquire credit.

Since the late seventies, up to 200 Japanese and Taiwanese  fishing  vessels
have been issued with annual fishing permits to catch tuna in South  African
waters. This is a  practice  we  inherited  from  the  apartheid  regime,  a
situation we as parliamentarians were never happy  about.  But,  today,  one
can say with pride  that  the  bilateral  agreement  with  Taiwan  has  been
cancelled and the next permits to Japan will be  for  six  months  only  and
then they will be terminated. Emphasizing the objectives of Nepad,  Minister
Moosa said:


  Allowing foreign fleets access to fish in South African waters undermines
  the ability of coastal developing states to develop their own fisheries.

I want to thank the hon the Minister  and  the  portfolio  committee.  These
resources will now go to South Africans, creating more jobs and  eradicating
poverty. [Applause.]

In conclusion,  we  will  continue  to  engage  with  Government  to  ensure
implementation. Poverty is a terror  facing  humanity,  the  terror  of  not
knowing where the next meal will come  from,  the  terror  of  knowing  that
one's children and their children will be condemned  to  a  life  of  abject
poverty, starvation, illiteracy and ill health. This needs all of  us  as  a
collective and only then can we succeed.  To  bring  the  matter  closer  to
home: We as a Parliament have a budget and the people of  the  Western  Cape
should be better off because Parliament is here. Our legislation  calls  for
equal opportunities. Our legislation calls  for  historically  disadvantaged
people's involvement in the economy of their country, not to  be  spectators
anymore, and that is what the Speaker said.

Do we as legislators ensure markets for these  people?  Often,  we  do  not.
Parliament can change the lives of many more  other  people,  especially  in
this province. Regarding the figures for people who visit Parliament,  where
are these visitors accommodated? Who transports  them?  Where  do  they  buy
their air tickets? If these questions can be answered, we can  stand  firmly
here and say: We are going in the right direction,  because  the  struggling
bed-and-breakfast outlets will now start having business as well.

Debate concluded.

                INTELLIGENCE SERVICES CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL,
               NATIONAL STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE AMENDMENT BILL,
                         INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BILL,
              ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY (PTY) LTD BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The  MINISTER  OF  INTELLIGENCE:  Chairperson,  when  I  heard  you   saying
something about an important debate, I thought that maybe you  were  talking
about my important debate.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That was  the  first  important
debate that was concluded, and now we have  another  very  important  debate
before us.

The MINISTER OF INTELLIGENCE: Chairperson,  thank  you  very  much  for  the
qualification.

My colleagues - the hon Nqakula and the hon Maduna - and I spent the  better
part of the yesterday visiting the scenes of  the  bombings  in  Soweto.  At
first, when we went down, we were not sure  if  we  were  not  presenting  a
picture of a very scared Government - all three  security  Ministers  there.
But, finally, we decided that we needed to be there because we wanted to  go
and assure our communities, our people  -  the  innocent  law-abiding  South
Africans - that are victims of these bombings that this  kind  of  desperate
attention-seeking strategies will not work, and that the  security  services
of this Government are more than able to deal with this.  We  were  able  to
give these assurances because we have invested  so  much  time  in  ensuring
that in fact, we can turn to our security  agencies  to  deal  with  exactly
this.

We are hoping that very soon we can come back here and explain to the  House
our successes in this regard. For us in  the  intelligence  community,  this
has meant a complete  restructuring  of  the  intelligence  dispensation  to
ensure that we are able to deal with the scourge of terrorism  of  our  day.
The four Bills before us today, underpin  that  restructuring  process  and,
indeed, with their passing, we will have completed this restructuring.

With the concurrence of the ad hoc committee, we have agreed that  the  most
logical way to deal with this, at this hour of the day  -  we  do  not  mind
having it pushed back by such  an  important  debate  such  as  the  one  on
poverty - is to deal with all these four Bills together. It  will  therefore
make a compact set of Bills that we are presenting to the  House.  The  four
Bills that we are presenting to the  House  are  the  Intelligence  Services
Bill, 2002; the Electronic Communications Security  (Pty)  Ltd  Bill,  2002;
the National Strategic Intelligence  Amendment  Bill  and  the  Intelligence
Services Control Amendment Bill, as read out by the Secretary.

In case of the new Bill - the Intelligence Services Control  Amendment  Bill
- the Intelligence Services Act was promulgated in 1995 with  the  intention
of ensuring that the six statutory and non-statutory services predating  the
1994 dispensation could be integrated  and  could  form  the  two  statutory
bodies that we now have - which is the South  African  Secret  Services  and
the National Intelligence Services. However,  since  the  inception  of  the
intelligence dispensation in 1995, there has been no consistent order  under
which the  intelligence  services  are  governed.  Whilst  the  intelligence
services were excluded from the broad public service dispensation,  we  were
also excluded from some provisions of the  Labour  Relations  Act.  We  thus
fell outside of this broad framework that is laid down for all agencies  and
services employed by the Government.

We have decided that we are going to bring the intelligence services  within
some kind of structured framework. In short, this is  the  purpose  of  this
first Bill that we are bringing to the House. The Bill addresses  five  main
issues. I hope this will interest Baba Mlangeni. I  hope  he  is  listening.
The first thing that we seek to do is to  ensure  that  all  those  men  and
women who worked so hard in the non-statutory services in  the  intelligence
capacity that brought our Government to where  we  are  now  are  adequately
remunerated for work that they have done. [Applause.] So what we  are  doing
is back-dating the pension  of  those  people  whom  we  integrated  in  our
services and also those who fell outside of our services for the  work  that
was done before the integration processes. Mentioning Baba Mlangeni did  not
mean that I have a pension for him. I was just  using  him  as  an  example.
[Laughter.] However, the Bill provides for the  cut-off  date  of  31  March
2004 for the availability of this benefit.

The second thing that the Bill seeks to do is to  provide  a  council  which
will be called the  Intelligence  Services  Council  on  the  Conditions  of
Service. In short, this will do what the Public Service Commission does  for
the Public Service, which is  basically  to  regulate  and  standardise  the
conditions of service  throughout  the  intelligence  community.  The  third
thing that the Bill seeks to do, is  to  create  a  lifelong  membership  in
intelligence, which is probably why we have the hon  Van  Schalkwyk  in  our
community. The  creation  of  a  lifelong  membership  of  the  intelligence
services is geared towards producing and retaining  the  best  officers  for
continuity, cohesion and mentorship of new members. This has led us  to  the
realisation that the cut-off age of 60 for  most  civil  services  will  not
work for us. Therefore, we are requesting that it must  be  pushed  back  to
65. Therefore, we are asking that the intelligence services  retirement  age
be 65. This will strike a chord with most members of Parliament.
The fourth element that we are seeking in this Bill is the establishment  of
the National Intelligence Academy. The Bill seeks to establish and  regulate
an academy for intelligence which will provide  intelligence  training,  and
this will be called the Sania. It  will  give  our  cadres  the  skills  and
expertise that  will  keep  them  at  the  cutting  edge  of  knowledge  and
technology that is so vital for their trade. The  Sania  will  also  provide
lateral entrants who bring in  scarce  skills  with  the  training  that  is
needed for their work.

We are faced with challenges of survival and with constantly innovating  and
improving our services.  Therefore,  we  are  hoping  that  the  Sania  will
provide this cornerstone of our work to ensure that,  indeed,  we  can  keep
the services at the cutting edge of all that is necessary for  the  delivery
of an excellent service. The academy will be a national institute that  will
train  all  state  agencies  dealing  with  collection  and  assessment   of
information such as the SAPS, the Scorpions, the SARS,  etc.  In  fact,  the
academy will  have  a  research  segment  and  any  enterprising  member  of
Parliament is  free  to  come  and  spend  his  sabbatical  researching  our
archives. Perhaps we might profit more from what might come out of there.

Finally, this Bill seeks restraint of trade. It seeks to ensure that  former
members of the  intelligence  services  are  forbidden  from  disclosure  of
classified information which is  prohibited  without  the  approval  of  the
director-general. Their employment in the security  industry  is  restricted
for a period of three years. They may not be employed for a period of  three
years in any security agency unless permission is granted by the DG.

The second Bill that we are putting forward to members  here  today  is  the
Electronic  Communications  Security  (Pty)  Ltd  -  the  Comsec  Bill.  The
provision  of  national  security  is  a  pivotal  core  business   of   the
Government. This function  requires  innovation,  creativity  and  a  steady
supply of  human  resources  and  financial  resources.  When  it  comes  to
technology, this is an even more costly venture. To ensure that we are  able
to provide national security at a cost-effective rate,  we  have  sought  to
create a company. This company will be called the Electronic  Communications
(Pty) Ltd.

The functions of Comsec Ltd are to protect Government's critical  electronic
communications  against  unauthorised  access  or  other  related  technical
threats. For purposes of the above-mentioned functions, Comsec will  invent,
develop,  design,  procure,  install  or  maintain   secure   communications
throughout government departments. It will  provide  cryptographic  services
and the necessary training for the upkeep of all these  communications.  All
government departments and organs of state will have to procure  and  access
electronic communications products and systems  with  the  verification  and
approval of this company.  However,  departments  or  state  organs  may  be
exempted from application of this Act with permission of the Minister.

Where  Comsec  Ltd  integrates  agencies  or  a  government   establishment,
providing communication system and product, the assets, liabilities,  rights
and duties of that integrated structure will  be  acquired  by  Comsec.  Our
courts will impose penalties for contravention  of  the  provision  of  this
Bill, once it has been passed.

The third Bill is the National Strategic Intelligence Amendment Bill and  it
is not a new Bill. The tragic events of 11  September  2001  in  the  United
States has brought home the danger of  unco-ordinated  intelligence  to  all
intelligence services. Learning from this  tragic  experience  and  our  own
shortcomings, we have decided to take stock  of  our  own  inter-agency  co-
operation and co-ordination. We conducted a review of Nicoc -  the  National
Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee established in 1995.

This review led us to the  identification  of  the  following  inadequacies:
Lack of consistent  co-operation  between  the  Nicoc  member  services  and
departments  with  regard  to  the  supply  of  intelligence  to  Nicoc  and
therefore, directly to the Government; lack of common understanding  by  the
Nicoc members of the exact meaning of intelligence activities, and  lack  of
understanding of proper  execution  of  the  mandates  of  the  intelligence
services.

Therefore, the amendment seeks to rectify all these weaknesses and,  amongst
other things, to strengthen the legal mandate of Nicoc and to  provide  that
the  SAPS  co-ordinates  all   crime   intelligence   and   supplies   crime
intelligence relating to national security through NICOC.  Furthermore,  the
amendment provides  for  the  regulations  on,  amongst  other  things,  the
security clearance, investigation and the protection of information.

Finally, we have the  Intelligence  Services  Control  Amendment  Bill.  The
Principal Act, which is the  Intelligence  Services  Control  Act  of  1994,
provides  for  oversight  of  intelligence  services  by   a   parliamentary
committee and the monitoring of activities of the intelligence  services  by
an Inspector-General or more. In this regard, the principal Act  has  proven
to be inadequate with regard to the oversight  of  financial  activities  of
the  intelligence  services  and  the  functioning  of  the  office  of  the
Inspector-General in that there are no clear  lines  of  accountability  for
the Inspector-General and no clear guidelines for his functions.

The objectives of this amending Bill are, amongst others, to give the  Joint
Standing  Committee  on  Intelligence  sole  responsibility  over  financial
oversight of the intelligence services; to provide  security  clearance  for
the Chairperson of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence; to  provide
for the appointment  of  one  Inspector-General  for  all  the  intelligence
services; to regulate the  termination  of  service  and  the  removal  from
office of any Inspector-General; to regulate the functions of the Inspector-
General and, thus, the IG will only monitor the  intelligence  and  counter-
intelligence functions of the intelligence services, and the IG will  notify
the head of a service before he/she gains access to  property  belonging  to
the services for the purposes of search and seizure.

We have made sure that all those matters that  were  vague  in  the  initial
legislation are now very clearly spelt out in this Bill. I am  being  rushed
through by the clock that is ticking ferociously next to  me.  Therefore,  I
will rush to the conclusion and say that these are the four  Bills  that  we
are bringing before the House. The ad hoc committee that was put up  by  the
House has done sterling work in a  very  short  space  of  time.  They  have
sought to build consensus and have accommodated many of our  needs.  We  are
very grateful for that. Despite the hiccups that accompany such  an  ad  hoc
process  of  law-making,  I  would  like   to   commend   them   for   their
understanding. They have delivered on the mandate  given  to  them  by  this
Parliament.

Transparency formed the cornerstone of their work at  the  committee  stage.
The public was invited to participate  through  making  written  and  verbal
representations. This involvement  was  an  indication  that  the  law  that
governs the intelligence services of this country is made by the people  for
the defence and protection of peace and democracy and of all civil  liberty.


We believe that with  this  package  of  legislation,  we  are  providing  a
critical edge for our services over their competitors, creating a  conducive
working environment that will ensure that they do their best at  all  times.
We provide the legal framework for them to continue  working  to  push  back
the frontiers of poverty by searching for  opportunities  abroad,  thwarting
threats domestically, and frustrating those that seek  to  profit  from  our
hard-won democracy. It is in the quest for excellence that we  are  shunning
mediocrity.

I therefore request the support of the hon members of  this  House.  I  take
this opportunity, once again, to thank, from the bottom  of  my  heart,  all
those members of the ad hoc committee who made this  possible,  the  members
of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and,  of  course,  my  hard-
working staff at the Ministry. [Applause.]

Dr S C CWELE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, today we  debate  four
pieces of legislation that aim to overhaul our intelligence dispensation  to
be in line with our  policy  of  making  our  intelligence  structures  more
efficient, effective, professional and accountable to the  people  of  South
Africa.

This debate takes place one day after  the  senseless  bombings  in  Soweto.
These criminals will never beat the resilience of our people  in  protecting
our democracy and our unity in the quest for  a  better  life  for  all.  We
would like to stress that there is no organisation which  has  the  capacity
to overthrow our Government.

We would like to pass our condolences on to the bereaved  families  and  the
affected communities. We are confident that our intelligence structures  and
security forces are on top of the situation and will soon bring  this  small
clique of senseless and directionless criminals to book. We  call  upon  our
members of the public to be  vigilant  and  not  to  handle  any  suspicious
parcels, but to call our national crime stop number. We urge members of  the
public to co-operate with the members of our security establishment.

The Intelligence Services Control Amendment Bill strengthens  the  oversight
for intelligence by making all new structures  of  intelligence  accountable
to the  Minister,  Auditor-General,  Inspector-General  and  to  the  public
through the Joint Standing Committee on  Intelligence  via  Parliament.  The
Bill further clarifies the functions of the Inspector-General  to  focus  on
the operational  intelligence  oversight  in  the  form  of  monitoring  the
intelligence  and  counterintelligence  functions  of  the   services.   The
Inspector-General will be accountable to the Minister for Intelligence,  the
Minister of Defence, the Minister of Safety and Security, the President  and
to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.

As hon members might be aware, our Inspector-General  resigned  in  February
this year.  We  are  in  the  process  of  finalising  the  new  regulations
regarding the functioning of the office of the Inspector-General. The  Joint
Standing Committee on Intelligence will be putting up an  advertisement  for
nominations next month, calling for South Africans of  integrity  and  those
who have the understanding of the intelligence community to apply. The  Bill
strengthens the JSCI's responsibility  of  maintaining  financial  oversight
over intelligence services. We hope  that  this  will  resolve  the  problem
being faced by other committees of Parliament, such as the Select  Committee
on  Public  Accounts,  in  effectively  scrutinising  the  finances  of  the
services.

The National Strategic Intelligence Amendment  Bill  seeks  to  enhance  the
effectiveness and efficiency of our  intelligence  structures  by  improving
its co-ordination of intelligence. It strengthens the National  Intelligence
Co-ordinating  Committee  -  Nicoc  -  by  putting  an  obligation  on   all
intelligence structures to forward all strategic intelligence to  Nicoc  for
processing, analysis  or  development  of  intelligence  products.  This  is
critical  in  avoiding  the  intelligence  gaps,  as  we  witnessed  in  the
unfortunate incident of September 11, 2001.

As South Africans, we take pride in the fact that since this US incident,  a
number of intelligence  organisations  and  oversight  committees  from  the
developed world and Africa have visited  South  Africa  to  learn  from  our
intelligence co-ordination. In strengthening our crime prevention  strategy,
the Bill empowers the intelligence division of the  SA  Police  Services  to
receive and co-ordinate all  technical  intelligence  in  order  to  prevent
crime and prosecute offenders.

We are living in a hostile and competitive world, hence  the  protection  of
our  secrets,  strategic  information  and  key   positions   have   to   be
strengthened by improving our  counterintelligence  capabilities.  The  Bill
clarifies the process  of  vetting  as  a  counterintelligence  function  by
detailing  the  procedures  for  vetting  in  the  Bill  rather   than   the
regulations. This will inform any person  what  to  expect  if  one  has  to
undergo security clearance in  South  Africa.  The  Cabinet  passed  Minimum
Information Security Standards also known as the MISS document  in  1997  in
order  to  ensure  the  observance  of  security  of  information   in   our
departments. The departments did not respond well to this policy. This  Bill
legalises the MISS document in order to criminalise  the  non-implementation
of this policy.

The Intelligence Services Bill, as the hon Minister has said, amongst  other
things, establishes the Intelligence Services Council on the  conditions  of
services. It also establishes the SA National Intelligence Academy to  train
our cadets and intelligence officers. It also provides for the restraint  of
trade for former members of intellegence.

The Electronic Communications Security  (Pty)  Ltd  Bill  provides  for  the
establishment of a private company - Comsec  (Pty)  Ltd  -  to  protect  and
secure critical electronic communications of all organs  of  the  state.  To
achieve this objective, the company will provide research,  development  and
training to the users  of  electronic  communication.  Comsec  will  receive
funding from the national fiscus,  donations,  bequests  and  cost  recovery
done on the basis of service level agreements.

Contrary to  what  has  been  published  in  the  media,  Comsec  is  not  a
communications service provider, but a defensive mechanism  to  protect  and
secure the electronic communication of the state. The company  is  envisaged
to be self-sufficient in the next few years, and it may  acquire  shares  in
strategic companies in South Africa, with the view to support this  mandate.


We would like to thank the task team under the leadership of  the  Director-
General for Communications, Mr Andile Ngcaba, and his team who  worked  very
hard in preparing for the production of this Bill. We  would  also  like  to
thank the Ministry, the heads of the national intelligence  structures,  and
all the intelligence officers who contributed to these Bills. The  committee
would also like to thank our legal adviser - Takalani - and  the  state  law
advisers who assisted the ad  hoc  committee  during  the  consideration  of
these Bills. We would also like to thank all those who participated  in  our
public  hearings,  despite  the  short  deadlines.   We   thank   our   NCOP
counterparts for active participation in the processing and finalisation  of
these Bills.

The ANC and the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on  Intelligence  supports  the
amended Intelligence Services Control  Amendment  Bill,  National  Strategic
Intelligence Amendment Bill, Intelligence Services Bill and  the  Electronic
Communications Security (Pty) Ltd Bill.  We  move  that  this  House  adopts
these Bills. [Applause.]

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Chairperson,  the  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,
intelligence  has  become  the  most  important  essentiality  for  the  top
management of all organs of state to  be  provided  with  good  and  timeous
intelligence to ensure  that  Government  is  prepared  and  ready  for  any
damaging acts from any adversary or from natural disasters.

To ensure this, our Government needs to have structures in place  which  can
cater  for  the  whole  intelligence  and  counterintelligence  spectrum  to
provide early warning to the  President  and  Government  of  any  impending
threat to the country. This spectrum is so wide  that  it  is  difficult  to
define. It not only rests with activities locally but globally  in  all  the
dimensions, which include that on the ground, in upper space and across  the
oceans.

I can quote the 11 September attack on the World Trade Centre in  New  York,
the Bali explosions, the Moscow theatre tragedy, but here  on  our  doorstep
in Gauteng, 10 bombs exploded two nights ago. They were ostensibly  directed
at the railway lines that are used by black commuters, taxi ranks, a  mosque
and a temple. We from the Democratic Alliance condemn this act of  terrorism
and urge Government to use all of its resources to find these  criminals  or
bombers and bring them to court.

We are debating intelligence today and asking ourselves how this could  have
happened without us being warned? Is it because our intelligence failed  us?
Time will tell. Our request is that we should prevent any future  occurrence
of this nature. I think we are all pleased to hear  that  the  Minister  and
the other two Ministers have visited the scenes of the bombings. I think  it
is good for the Minister to go and see for herself what happened.

I wish to quote from an article  written  by  Michael  Elliot  in  the  Time
Magazine of 2 August 2002 regarding the 11 September incident:


  Sometimes history  is  made  by  the  forces  of  arms  on  battlefields,
  sometimes by the  fall  of  an  exhausted  empire.  But  often  when  the
  historians set about figuring why a nation took one  course  rather  than
  another or not at all, they are more interested in who said what to  whom
  at a meeting far from the public eye whose  true  significance  may  have
  been missed by those who took part in it.

With  all  this  in  mind,  South  Africa  needs  quality  and  well-trained
operators and planners who are  supported  by  up-to-date,  state-of-the-art
equipment. It is for this purpose that we have four Bills before  Parliament
today. Their purpose is to improve the existing legislation  or  to  provide
for additional services. These Bills  should  not  be  for  the  purpose  of
advancing the aims of one to the detriment of the other.

With regard to the Intelligence Services  Control  Amendment  Bill,  the  DA
welcomes the name change from `control' to `oversight'.  The  responsibility
for  the  financial  oversight  of  the  intelligence  service  is   a   big
responsibility, and we may require expertise within the JSCI.

We welcome the opportunity of one inspector-general for  all  the  services.
The functions that are allocated to  this  post  are  substantial,  and  the
Minister and the committee should make doubly sure that  a  fit  and  proper
person, someone with  stature,  undisputed  integrity,  acceptable  academic
qualifications and vast managerial experience is appointed. We support  this
Bill.

With regard to  the  National  Strategic  Intelligence  Amendment  Bill,  we
mention the National Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee. This is  also  my
pet subject. I always address this subject because this  committee  has  the
important responsibility of co-ordinating  all  intelligence  gathered  from
the National Intelligence Agency, the SA Secret Service  and,  in  addition,
the  Defence  Intelligence  Division  and  the  Police  Crime   Intelligence
Division.  Co-operation  and  co-ordination  between   these   services   is
essential in order for Nicoc, as we refer  to  it  in  short,  to  meet  its
obligations. Information should be fed into the Nicoc system daily which  in
turn should make a national intelligence estimate of the situation in  South
Africa and the countries which have an influence on us.

It is of no use to have a Nicoc which is not  collecting  and  co-ordinating
the mass of information available from all the services.

The DA objects to the reference to the organs of state as used in  clause  3
of the Bill.  The  organs  of  state  as  defined  in  section  239  of  the
Constitution does not restrict it  to  state  departments,  but  many  other
functioneries such as the Law Society of South Africa. I do not  think  that
the legislator intended that.

In clause 3, a new section 2A has been inserted. The DA  is  concerned  that
the requirements in this section 2A 1(a) are  too  stringent  in  such  that
they stipulate that any person employed by or is an applicant  to  an  organ
of state needs to be security cleared. This is impractical  and  impossible.
I can go into details as far as that  is  concerned.  For  this  reason,  we
oppose this Bill.

On  the  Intelligence  Services  Bill,  the  DA  wishes  to  highlight   the
establishment of the South African National Academy  of  Intelligence.  This
name is very impressive and the academy  will  be  registered  with  the  SA
Qualifications Authority. We should make sure that the right person is  also
appointed to head this academy.  In  the  first  instance,  he  should  have
experience  in  managing  a  training  unit,  in  managing  training,   good
administration and selecting the right staff. This should not be a  job  for
friends. The DA supports this Bill.
Now we come to the Electronic Communications Security (Pty) Ltd Bill,  which
is generally referred to as the Comsec Bill. The purpose of this Bill is  to
proviode for the establishment of a company  that  will  provide  electronic
communications, security products and services of organs  of  state  and  to
provide for matters connected thereto.

Questions that come to mind are the following: Firstly, why do  we  have  to
have a  separate  establishment  to  provide  these  intelligence  services?
Secondly, why is a private company soley owned by the  state,  and  thirdly,
why  cannot  one  of  the  existing  intelligence  services  be  given  this
responsibility as a separate substructure within the organisation?

This Bill and its contents seem to be very close to the ECT, the  Electronic
Critical  Communications  and  Transactions  Bill,  which  provides  for   a
declaration of critical databases and for control and security  in  general.
It is a company which is subsidised by the state  yet  is  mandated  to  buy
shares in any company, not necessarily manufacturing  security  products  or
providing a security service and which is registered in South Africa. It  is
also exempted from the Broadcasting and Telecommunications  Law  and,  under
certain conditions, from the Companies Act.

In clause 17, we again have reference to the organ of state. There  are  too
many questions which are left  unanswered  as  far  as  this  is  concerned.
Private companies have repeatedly expressed their  concern  that  Comsec  is
state-owned and will be encroaching on their own functions and products.

It is a known fact that here in South Africa  -  members  should  listen  to
this and it is true - and in the world at large that  intelligence  agencies
are seen as sinister organisations which, because of  the  secretiveness  of
their work, hide behind the myth that they can do whatever they  please  and
are untouchable. This is not the case, but a Bill of  this  nature  such  as
the Comsec Bill will only fan the flame of suspicion. The  DA  opposes  this
Bill.

Finally, I want to thank the Chairman of the JSCI and commend  him  for  his
efforts and drive to have these Bills tabled in such a short period.  It  is
unfortunate that it was workshopped during recess period where I,  for  one,
was unable to consult knowledgeable members of my caucus over  this  period.
This resulted  in  me  changing  what  I  had  agreed  to  during  committee
deliberations. [Applause.]

Mr D M GUMEDE: Chairperson, the hon Minister, hon members and  comrades,  as
we open taps, turning desserts into green fields, switch on lights  in  more
poor households, and as Africa rises from a long nightmare  of  poverty  and
ignorance, opportunities spring up and, with them, more and  varied  threats
emerge.

A relatively new form of threat is in the field  of  information  operations
where it is no longer necessary for people or organisations to  have  direct
physical access to a phone or a computer in order to listen,  copy,  destroy
or manipulate data and information. This  has  created  a  need  for  us  to
protect our information and our information infrastructure against a  number
of hostile agents.

Although  security  measures  are  in  place  to   protect   the   country's
telecommunications infrastructures,  the  development  of  attack  tools  to
bypass these protective measures is ongoing,  and  these  attack  mechanisms
are now freely  available  via  the  Internet.  The  number  of  information
infrastructure intrusions grew from 1 334 in 1993 to  15  167  in  the  year
2000  and  increases  proportionately  to  the  degree  of  connectivity  to
external networks such as that of the Internet, according  to  the  Canadian
Intelligence Service. According to this  service,  such  connections  create
vulnerabilities that can be exploited for whatever reason by hostile  actors
using malicious software such as viruses, Trojan horses and  worms  via  the
Internet.

The need for protection  against  cybercrime,  cyberterrorism,  netspionage,
hacktivism, which is  hacking,  etc  has  to  be  increased  and  constantly
developed.  This  needs  a  substantial  amount  of  ongoing  research   and
development and massive resources that are  immediately  available,  and  we
know that as new  technologies  develop,  so  too  will  the  technology  of
hostile agents and criminals. This needs flexibility and various amounts  of
funding within short notice, which government's department cannot do.  These
are the reasons that make it  critical  to  form  Electronic  Communications
Security (Pty) Ltd,  which  is  known  as  Comsec.  Comsec  has  to  respond
promptly  to  a  constant  sophisticated  attack  on  information  and   the
information infrastructure of South Africa.

It is founded in order to improve protection of  critical  electronic  state
information from being abused by those who want to harm  South  Africa,  its
people and its interest. It is an instrument to protect South Africans  more
efficiently, more effectively and  better  in  an  area  where  flexibility,
constant research and development are critical. Thus we need a company  that
is separate from the restriction of government department operations.

Imagine what would have happened to the hostages in the  Moscow  theatre  if
the terrorists had known beforehand exactly what the troops  were  about  to
undertake!

Comsec will be a defensive organ, and it is not the intention of  Government
to use it offensively. For example, with today's technology, it is  possible
to send a photograph and information for processing of a  passport  illegaly
without the applicant in question setting foot on South African  soil.  Such
acts have to be prevented by information operations of a high  international
calibre. Successful trade negotiations with other trade blocs  such  as  the
EU,  Nafta,  etc  depend  on  the  protection  of  sensitive  and   critical
information that the state has, which has to be used by  the  state  at  the
right place, at the right time and for a specific purpose.

These operations definitely cannot  be  left  in  the  hands  of  a  private
company whose mandate, agenda and interests may  not  always  coincide  with
that of the state, as is the  position  currently.  We  need  a  responsive,
agile agent that can respond promptly and effectively.

The company will have  to  raise  its  own  funds  and  have  funds  readily
available to keep up to date with rapidly  changing  electronic  information
technology in the rapidly developing field  of  information  operations.  It
has come to be known that we have to tap into  technology  as  and  when  it
becomes neccessary, cognizant of the fact that it is  not  abnormal  for  an
expensive innovation to be obsolete within a short period of  three  months.
The type of lags  in  Government  decision-making  is  a  luxury  we  cannot
afford.

Acquisition of shares  with  best  returns  for  self-sustenance  so  as  to
respond speedily to emergencies and rapidly changing demands  of  a  rapidly
changing technology is crucial. Limiting the company to any sector may  lead
to nonviability, a lack  in  capacity  and  lack  of  competitiveness  where
research and development, which does not come cheaply, is critical. This  is
why the company has got to acquire shares in any company.
The returns should allow it to  be  able  to  fund  expensive  research  and
development in a rapidly changing  technological  environment.  Comsec  will
have to maintain a competitive  edge  in  the  industry  in  order  to  keep
abreast with the state-of-the-art technology,  and  therefore  has  to  form
strategic partnerships with  other  companies  and  universities  and  other
institutions of higher learning. For this company to be viable, it  has  to,
at least, meet two critical requirements: it has to have  readily  available
funds and lead  in  its  field  of  technology.  This  largely  informs  the
structure and the nature of this company. Any good  manager  will  tell  the
members that this is the best option  for  the  dictates  of  this  type  of
situation.

Comsec  is  defensive  and  pre-empts  abuse  of  strategic,  critical   and
sensitive state information by sophisticated hostile agents and enemies  out
there. For example, they may be criminal syndicates, extremists  groups  and
those who want to compete unfairly in international trade.

These  developments  demand  ever-increasing  vigilance  that  can  only  be
sustained by ever-modernising research  and  development  that  move  faster
than  that  of  unscrupulous  trade  competitors,  criminal  syndicates  and
enemies of the state and its people.

[This new company is going to stop spies and informers  who  belong  to  the
enemies of the Government and South  Africans.  Those  people  eavesdrop  on
conversations of the Government, the police and the armed  forces  in  order
to  plan  criminal  activities  and  fight  the  South  African  Government.
[Applause.]]

Mr E T FERREIRA: The IFP believes that there can be no argument  that  South
Africa must have good and effective intelligence services. September  11  of
last year, bombings in Cape Town a few years ago and explosions  in  Gauteng
less than 48 hours ago, makes one appreciate  the  importance  of  having  a
good intelligence service.

No intelligence service can  be  perfect  and  no  intelligence  agency  can
prevent every single attack on a country's sovereignty or on its people  but
a good and effective  intelligence  service  can  make  that  risk  so  much
smaller.

In front of  us  today  we  have  4  intelligence  Bills,  the  Intelligence
Services Bill, the  National  Strategic  Intelligence  Amendment  Bill,  the
Intelligence  Services   Control   Amendment   Bill   and   the   Electronic
Communications Security (Pty) Ltd Bill, better known  as  the  Comsec  Bill.
Are these Bills in front of us today going to improve the  effectiveness  of
our intelligence agencies? The answer is  undoubtedly  yes.  Currently,  our
different intelligence  agencies  seem  not  that  well  co-ordinated,  with
everyone having their own  D.G.  and  everyone  basically  doing  their  own
thing. There also appears to be a fair amount of  duplication  in  the  work
done by different agencies as they each operate rather independently.

The IFP supports  the  Intelligence  Services  Control  Amendment  Bill  and
specifically welcomes that the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on  Intelligence
will have the  sole  responsibility  for  the  financial  oversight  of  the
intelligence services and that the Bill will provide for the appointment  of
one inspector-general for all the services.

We also support the National Strategic  Intelligence  Amendment  Bill  which
will establish Nicoc to co-ordinate all intelligence. This  Bill  will  also
provide for the SA Police Services to co-ordinate crime intelligence and  to
supply Nicoc with the necessary information.

Although there were one or two minor contentious issues in the  Intelligence
Services Bill like the validation of misconduct proceedings  and  employment
in the security industry, the IFP has no problem  in  supporting  the  Bill.
Some people are nervous about  the  National  Academy  of  Intelligence.  We
believe, however, that it will increase  the  quality  of  our  intelligence
operatives. We hope that the stringent requirements set out  for  operatives
will be properly implemented so that we do not have a similar  situation  as
we have in the SAPS. How many of our policemen and women cannot take  decent
statements and how many  of  our  senior  officers  have  never  had  police
training?

The one Bill that the IFP does not feel completely comfortable with  is  the
Electronic Communications Security (Pty)  Ltd  Bill,  better  known  as  the
Comsec Bill. The Bill establishes a private company with  the  objective  to
protect and secure electronic communications of organs of state, as we  have
already heard. The Government will be the sole shareholder of  this  private
company, which is to be exempted from certain provisions  of  the  Companies
Act. We do not have a problem with any of the above, as it is  important  to
secure Government communications. We are nervous, however, of  Comsec  which
is, as the House should remember,  an  arm  of  the  intelligence  services,
being given authority in this Act to buy shares in  any  company  whatsoever
in the Replublic which is registered as a private company.

The argument of the department  in  the  committee  deliberations  was  that
Comsec may need to acquire shares in other companies in the  same  field  so
that they can be up to date with the latest  technologies  and  products  as
far as their functions are  concerned.  This  is  quite  understandable  and
acceptable. The IFP has no problem with this either.

When I suggested, though, that we should then allow them, in clause  10,  to
buy shares in any company related to their  work,  they  turned  my  request
down suggesting that a chocolate company is not limited as  to  who  it  can
buy shares in. The reality of course is that a chocolate company is  not  an
arm of our intelligence service and does not have  Government  as  its  sole
shareholder. If there is no sinister political reason for  the  intelligence
service wanting to buy into private companies, why is it so unacceptable  to
only buy into communication-related companies?

However, in the long run,  one  has  to  weigh  up  the  positives  and  the
negatives in every single Bill. In this case, we believe that the  positives
outweigh the negatives. Therefore, the IFP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms M C LOBE: Chairperson, comrades and friends, in the  endeavour  to  build
an efficient, effective, professional and accountable  intelligene  service,
the National Strategic Intelligence Amendment Bill seeks to  strengthen  the
co-ordination of intelligence and national strategic intelligence.  In  this
regard, it empowers the Minister to establish necessary structures  for  the
efficient co-ordination of intelligence and to assist in advisory  functions
for Cabinet. It also provides for the exclusion of the Minister as a  member
of the National Intelligence Co-ordinating  Committee,  as  a  mechanism  to
draw a distinction between the political responsibility of the  Minister  of
Intelligence and the co-ordinator for  intelligence,  thereby  strengthening
accountability and the legal mandate of Nicoc in order to  put  intelligence
at the centre of government business.

Within the broad framework of strength  and  co-ordination,  the  Bill  also
provides for national intelligence structures to supply  counter  and  crime
intelligence relating to  national  strategic  intelligence  to  Nicoc.  The
security services remain seized with the challenge posed  by  crime  in  our
country. In this regard, several joint operations or  projects  between  the
various agencies are conducted so as to deal with organised crime groups  to
convert intelligence into evidence admissible in  a  court  of  law  without
undermining the intelligence capacity of our structures.

By this we mean that Nicoc will take over all responsibility  over  the  co-
ordination of  national  strategic  intelligence.  This  co-ordination  will
assist in strengthening co-operation  amongst  intelligence  structures.  It
will ensure that intelligence structures complement each other and  minimise
competition. It will also contribute positively to the usage of our  limited
resources in the sense that duplication will  be  eliminated.  Co-ordination
of intelligence is also necessary for a  developing  country  like  ours  in
order to protect our developing economy and our young democracy.

It is important to know that, as a result of the  co-ordinated  approach  to
intelligence,  our  country  has  never   encountered   major   intelligence
failures, as  experienced  by  bigger  countries.  But  the  small  isolated
incidents, as experienced recently with  the  Soweto  bombings  confirm  the
need  to  strengthen  co-ordination  and  build  an  effective,   efficient,
professional and accountable intelligence service.

Perhaps one should emphasize the  fact  that  since  1994  our  intelligence
service has been  accountable  to  Parliament  through  the  Joint  Standing
Committee on Intelligence. Therefore, the Joint Standing Committee  performs
oversight  functions  in  relation   to   the   intelligence   and   counter
intelligence functions, including administration, financial  management  and
expenditure of the services.

As a result thereof, other countries continue to learn from our  model.  Not
long ago, we hosted a British delegation  from  the  intelligence  oversight
committee that was interested to learn about  our  oversight  role  and  our
relationship to Parliament. This shows that, as a young democracy,  we  have
something good and  unique.  Without  intelligence,  our  ability  to  delve
behind the increasingly organised and vicious wave of crime in  our  country
and across our borders will be blinkered. For all this  intelligence  to  be
effective it has, in the final analysis, to dip its hands into  the  closely
guarded  self-interest   of   individuals,   organisations,   economic   and
government entities.

This brings forth the importance and relevance  of  security  screening  and
investigations by our national intelligence structures.  The  Bill  provides
for  the  security  screening  investigation  which  was  provided  for   in
regulations only and not in law. The objective in this regard is  to  ensure
that the vetting process  is  part  of  the  legislation  and  captures  the
intentions of the legislature,  noting  contravecies  and  misunderstandings
regarding this process.

Over  the  past  few  years,  security  screening  constituted  a  bone   of
contention and sometimes  was  met  with  resistance,  particularly  because
people felt undermined, threatened, their privacy being at stake, and  their
loyalty and integrity challenged.

I take this  opportunity  to  emphasise  the  need  for  security  screening
investigations  as  part  of  counter-intelligence  for   the   purpose   of
protecting our economy, democracy and  our  country.  National  intelligence
structures may conduct security screening investigations  to  determine  the
security competence of a person employed or who is an applicant to an  organ
of state or is rendering  service  or  has  given  an  intention  to  render
service on the organ of state a service that will give  that  person  access
to classified information to the possesion of the organ of state or  service
that will give that person  access  to  areas  designated  as  national  key
points in terms of the National Key Points Act of 1980.
Clearly, people who have access to classified information should  be  people
of integrity. In this  regard,  the  Bill  also  provides  for  the  use  of
polygraph tests as a mechanism  to  ascertain,  confirm  or  examine,  in  a
scientific manner, the truthfulness of the statement made by  a  person.  In
determining the security clearance of any person,  the  relevant  member  of
the national intelligence  structure  may  gather  information  relating  to
criminal record, financial records, personal information and other  relevant
information.

In situations where the gathering of information requires  the  interception
and monitoring of the communication of such a person,  the  relevant  member
should perform this function  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the
Interception and Monitoring Act.

The Bill also makes a provision regarding a person whose security  clearance
has been refused, withdrawn or degraded. In this  regard,  that  person  may
appeal to the Minister responsible  for  a  relevant  national  intelligence
structure who, in turn, will assess the merits and demerits of such a  case.
The objective here is to ensure that the security screening is credible  and
contributes to the building  of  an  efficient  and  effective  intelligence
service.

The screening process is part of the  international  best  practice  in  the
sense that, in countries  such  as  Canada,  government  requires  that  its
employees and contractors who, in the regular performance of  their  duties,
have access to sensitive  information  and  assets  be  assessed  for  their
loyalty and associated reliability as those related to a  national  security
concern. The Canadian government security policy  establishes  three  levels
of security clearance, the first one being confidential, the second,  secret
and the third, top secret. Checks are performed for each level  and  include
the verification  of  personal  and  educational  and  employment  data  and
references.  The  Canadian  security  intelligence  service  Act  defines  a
security assessment as an appraisal of loyalty to Canada in  so  far  as  it
relates to the reliability of the individual.

This model is similar to the South African model in the sense that, even  in
our country, we have  a  similar  provision.  I  take  this  opportunity  to
emphasise that the objective of the security screening process is  two-fold:
firstly, to protect classified information  and  assets  and,  secondly,  to
prevent unathourised access to sensitive government sites  on  national  key
points. It is the duty of our intelligence services  to  conduct  background
investigation and provide security assessment so that  individuals  involved
in hostile foreign intellignece activities or  criminal  activities  do  not
have access to classified material or national key  points.  The  Bill  will
provide a framework within which the national  intelligence  structures  are
empowered to carry out these responsibilities. [Applause.]

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Mr Chairperson, I would like to  thank  the  officials  who
were  involved  during  the  discussions  by  the  Ad   Hoc   Committee   on
Intelligence  on  these  Bills.  It   required   long   hours   of   intense
deliberations and concentration, and our thanks go to  the  chairperson  and
the staff. On behalf of the New NP, I would also  like  to  thank  everybody
who was involved for taking note of our arguments and trying to  incorporate
some of these in the four Bills before us.

There are two buzzwords these days that are often used in various  contexts.
The one is ``globalisation'', and the other is ``delivery.'' A country  owes
it to its citizens  to  see  to  it  that  intelligence  services  can  also
compete, as far as possible, on  a  global  scale  because  crime  does  not
respect border or climate, the rich or the poor, black or  white.  Crime  is
global, and so should our intelligence services be. But, to play that  role,
we need to give them the tools to enable them to  be  proactive  as  far  as
possible. These Bills before us today are about those tools.

We plead in this House, almost daily, for better service delivery, but I  am
sure most of us do not think about intelligence as also having a vital  role
to play in delivery, by timeously informing their  clients  about  impending
crimes. If South Africa falls behind on these two  issues,  inter  alia,  we
are heading for disaster. It is therefore a positive  move  to  establish  a
national  intelligence   academy.   The   academy   will   have   university
accreditation, and certificates, diplomas  or  degrees  will  be  available.
Through this institution, we hope  to  train  professional  and  exceptional
intelligence officials and operatives.

The  Intelligence  Services  Bill  regulates  the  establishment   of   this
facility, conditions of service, and retirement age  of  staff  as  well  as
disciplinary measures and processes. It also regulates the establishment  of
an Intelligence Services Council on Conditions of Service and  a  forum  for
members with grievances because no member of  the  intelligence  service  or
the academy may strike or induce  or  conspire  with  any  other  member  to
strike.

Die aanstelling van die Inspekteur-Generaal  van  Intelligensie  is  ook  al
geruime  tyd  uitstaande.  Vorige  ondervinding  in  hierdie  proses,  asook
onduidelike diensvoorwaardes, het duidelik laat blyle dat regstelling  nodig
was.  Die  Intelligensiedienste-Beheerkonsepwet  reguleer  die  proses   wat
gevolg moet word en stel die diensvoorwaardes  van  die  inspekteur-generaal
duidelik. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The appointment of the Inspector-General  of  Intelligence  has  also  been
outstanding for quite some time. Previous experience  in  this  process,  as
well as unclear conditions of service, made it apparent  that  rectification
was necessary. The draft Intelligence Services Control  Bill  regulates  the
process that should be followed and clarifies the conditions of  service  of
the inspector-general.]

During the debate on the Broadcasting Amendment  Bill  on  23  October  this
year in this House, the hon Sue Vos of the IFP said, and I quote:


  Given the intensely political nature  of  the  terrain  of  this  battle,
  vigilance is required. One needs to ask, for instance, why the Electronic
  Communications Security (Pty) Ltd Bill has just been  shepherded  through
  the intelligence committee, and not where it obviously belongs, ie in the
  communications domain.


  Not all of us can surely be so naive as to not wonder why it was  steered
  through the safer waters of the  intelligence  committee  -  surely  less
  intimately familiar with the subject  matter  -  and,  needless  to  say,
  survived  relatively  intact.  The  stormy  seas  of  the  communications
  committee would, no doubt, have been a different matter.  Over  and  over
  again in our committee, we have to address matters of  constitutionality,
  and ``executive creep'' into the public and private  domain  of  the  ICT
  sector.

I find this an arrogant and unenlightened statement by  the  member  because
she has obviously not read the whole Bill before  us  today,  or  she  would
have seen that it deals with  intelligence  and  not  about  her  phoning  a
friend.  She  has  also  never  attended  a  Joint  Standing  Committee   on
Intelligence meeting because these meetings are closed. What on earth  would
give her the audacity to think that more intelligent  and  vigilant  members
serve on the Portfolio Committee on Communications than on the JSCI?  Is  it
her ignorance because our meetings are not discussed in  newspapers  and  on
television, and therefore she thinks we are all asleep  in  those  meetings?
This is also a grave motion of no confidence in her colleague who serves  on
the JSCI. Much deliberation and many hours  of  discussions  went  into  the
Electronic Communications Security  (Pty)  Ltd  Bill.  It  is  necessary  to
provide a secure communication facility to the head of  state  from  and  to
wherever he may be. [Interjections.]

With the advent of cyber terrorism a few  years  ago,  no  communication  is
deemed safe anymore. The numerous efforts - approximately 140 attempts -  to
crack computer systems in South Africa  prior  to  and  during  the  special
events coming to South  Africa,  highlighted  the  necessity  for  a  secure
communication system in South  Africa.  These  special  events  happen  more
frequently, and delegates in larger numbers attend these summits.

Comsec will be able to  charge  consultancy  fees  and  build  up  financial
reserves so as to enable it to  keep  abreast  with  the  fast-changing  and
expensive  technology.  Intelligence  services  in  some  of   the   leading
countries of the world told the JSCI that the shelf life  of  technology  is
90 days. After 90 days, there is something new or better on the  market.  To
try to keep up with these changes, a country needs to spend  more  and  more
on this facility. Therefore, the reserves built up by Comsec will assist  in
this respect.

In our efforts to establish a world-class intelligence service, the  New  NP
supports all four Bills. [Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Mr Chairperson,  we  also  wish  to  join  in  echoing  all  the
messages of sympathy that have been expressed with regard to the victims  of
the bomb blasts during the course of the week. Our hearts go  out  to  those
two young orphans who have lost their sole supporter  and  their  mother  in
this particular process.

But what reminds one is that the sort of operations we have seen during  the
week are reminiscent of what the Ossewa-Brandwag did in the 1940s. They  too
went for certain strategic installations,  for  example,  railway  lines  to
demobilise the community, electricity sub-stations, etc.  One  thus  sees  a
sort of correlation between the operations of those days and those  we  have
witnessed this week. Of course, the thought in the  minds  of  most  of  our
fellow countrypeople is: Where next, and who will be the  next  victims?  We
pray to Almighty God that our services will put in  every  effort  to  track
down the perpetrators and  that  our  communities  can  live  in  peace  and
harmony, as we are well on our way to nation-building.

The concept Bill proposes the establishment of a company which will  provide
electronic communication security products and services to organs of  state.
The proposed company will be established as a private company  in  terms  of
the Companies Act, with the state as the sole shareholder. The main  purpose
of  the  company  will  be  to  protect  and   secure   certain   electronic
communications of organs of  state  against  unauthorised  access  of  other
related technical or electronic threats. The company will be  managed  by  a
board of directors, one of whom would be the  chief  executive  officer.  In
addition, the company will integrate agencies of  the  state  which  provide
services similar to those of Comsec.

During a GCIS media briefing, the question was raised  whether  the  company
would be a rival to Telkom. The Director-General of NIA, Mr Vusi  Mavimbela,
replied that Comsec is intended to supply  communications  security  in  the
same  way  that  the  State  Information  Technology  Agency  functions  for
information,  in  that  government  departments  will   have   comprehensive
communications security.

During the same  media  briefing,  the  Minister  of  Intelligence  Services
explained  the  rationale  behind  the  new  intelligence  legislation.  The
demands  of  globalisation  have   brought   about   many   challenges   for
intelligence services across the world. The four new Bills under  discussion
are therefore the result of these new  challenges  in  that  it  has  become
incumbent upon all intelligence services to improve  the  skills  and  trade
craft of their members.

The legislation under discussion should assist in changing  the  operational
environment  by  balancing  secrecy  and  transparency,  focusing  on  human
security issues that are transnational in  nature,  and  finding  innovative
ways of securing the state and the nation. As far as one of the measures  is
concerned, the most significant result of that proposed legislation will  be
the establishment  of  the  SA  National  Academy  of  Intelligence.  It  is
envisaged that the proposed SA National Academy will be a national  resource
for intelligence, research and training. The  academy  will  be  responsible
for ensuring that every member of the intelligence service  is  multiskilled
and equipped to perform optimally in the conditions facing South Africa.

The main features of the National Strategic Intelligence Amendment Bill  are
to redefine the mandate of the National Intelligence Agency,  together  with
that of the Crime Intelligence Directorate of the  SA  Police  Service.  The
SAPS will be given the responsibility of  co-ordinating  crime  intelligence
in all intelligence departments.

We will support all four Bills. [Applause.]

Mr R P ZONDO: Mr Chairperson, the ANC regards the establishment  of  the  SA
National Academy of Intelligence as a step further  away  from  the  painful
past, where education and training was characterised by a fragmented  system
based along racial and ethnic lines. For example, the former  TBVC  products
resulted in the unequal access to education and training at  all  levels  of
the system. This had a devastating effect on the development of the  economy
and the society.

The  Intelligence  Services  Bill  seeks  to  provide  training  of   loyal,
competent and acknowledgeable  cadets  for  the  intelligence  community  to
enable them to generate  the  required  product  timeously  and  of  a  high
standard and quality. This is also aimed at promoting  peace  and  stability
in South Africa, within the SADC region and the continent of Africa.
Individuals are recruited from society. Such recruits need to be trained  as
they are technically cadets without  formal  intelligence  training.  It  is
envisaged that the academy will provide education and training to  orientate
them into the intelligence culture and  provide  them  with  a  professional
qualification that certifies  them  as  intelligence  professionals.  It  is
further envisaged that new recruits to the  intelligence  community  through
the academy will not be restricted to university  graduates  but  will  also
include talented young people who have passed Grade 12  or  its  equivalent.
The infusion of such  young  blood  would  add  continuity  to  the  current
intelligence community.

We need to accept the harsh reality that the intelligence  culture  pre-1994
was characterised  by  negligence  due  to  bureaucratic  design,  ignorance
brought about by racial prejudices, apartheid and apathy mainly due  to  the
security state existence that exposed political and social  expediency.  The
retraining  is  a  total  commitment  of  the  ANC-led  Government   towards
equitable democratic rights, the prevalence  of  the  rule  of  law  in  our
country and has as its fundamental philosophy the  development  of  existing
members of the intelligence community into key  assets  to  be  utilized  to
ensure that national security is achieved and human security  challenges  in
South Africa met. This vital piece  of  transformation  legislation,  in  my
view, is aimed at killing the remaining apartheid legacy  with  kindness  by
restoring pride and dignity due to the fact that  the  previous  law  taught
people what to think and not how to think.

With the restructuring of the  intelligence  community  to  incorporate  the
academy, a backlog of training has occurred. To address this backlog, it  is
envisaged that a priority list for training be drafted in consultation  with
the various structures of the intelligence community under the  auspices  of
the National  Intelligence  Co-ordinating  Committee  and  the  Minister  of
Intelligence Services. All qualifications offered by  the  academy  will  be
South African Qualification Authority-approved certificates underwritten  by
the  academy  intelligence  defence   sector's:   education   and   training
authority. Hence, all qualifications of the  academy  will  incorporate  the
various SAQA-  approved  levels  of  qualifications  which  will  facilitate
lateral entrance of recruits. This will  also  allow  continuity  in  formal
studies  of  such  recruits  through  the   academy   and   its   respective
qualifications.

The other general  powers  of  the  Minister  are  the  appointment  of  the
Intelligence Service Council. One of the main aims  of  the  council  is  to
provide a mechanism that will ensure that  labour  relations  are  regulated
effectively  within  the  intelligence  dispensation  by  members   in   the
determination of conditions of services, and  will  set  up  infrastructures
towards that end. This infrastructure is the consultation forum and will  be
staffed  by  full-time  members  of  the  Intelligence  Services  who   will
represent fellow members' interests. This is to ensure  that  there  are  no
trade unions that operate within  the  services,  as  these  are  likely  to
undermine  national  security  and  lead  to  unauthorised   disclosure   of
classified information. The council will consult  with  the  Public  Service
Collective Bargaining Chamber in  Public  Service.  This  is  an  innovation
aimed at making sure that we do not falter on those  issues  highlighted  in
the Constitutional Court judgment against the Department of Defence.  In  so
doing, we will have taken all the necessary measures to ensure that  we  are
not found wanting in this regard.

Disciplinary measures will also be governed by the provisions of  the  Bills
and will be supplemented by comprehensive internal policies and  regulations
promulgated by the chief executive officer of the academy according  to  the
norms of Government and the specifics of  the  intelligence  community.  The
CEO and the staff of the academy will strive at  all  times  to  maintain  a
high level of  professionalism  in  the  performance  of  their  duties  and
functions. The CEO and staff of the academy shall strive at all times to  be
efficient in the utilization of resources for the performance of the  duties
and functions, as well as ensuring that  such  utilization  is  done  in  as
transparent a manner as possible. The Promotion  of  Access  to  Information
Act must be applied.

The CEO shall report to Parliament, in  conjunction  with  the  Minister  of
Intelligence Services, on  the  progress  for  the  preceding  year  in  the
achievement of the objectives of the academy as well as on  the  utilization
of all assets and resources, including the annual  budget  of  the  academy.
All records of the academy shall be subject to the scrutiny of the  Auditor-
General  and  the  Inspector-General  of  the  intelligence  community.   In
addition,  the  CEO  shall  report  to  the  Joint  Standing  Committee   on
Intelligence on  any  issues  pertaining  to  the  academy  for  which  such
information has been requested by the committee.

In conclusion, njengoba sizwana ukuthi:  Bjale  ke  nako!  The  academy  can
provide support to the African Union by using Nepad as a vehicle to  achieve
this. The academy in  turn  can  promote  political  stability,  continental
security and mutual economic growth and development through the  sharing  of
training opportunities  of  African  Union  members  by  incorporating  such
opportunities in the Nepad agreement with such countries.  This  will  go  a
long way  to  ensuring  that  the  academy  becomes  the  foremost  training
authority for intelligence training on the African continent.

The ANC supports the Bills. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, time does not allow me to  comment  on  all  four
Bills but I would like  to  comment  on  a  few  of  them.  I  come  to  the
Intelligence Services Control Amendment Bill. As a young and new  democracy,
we embarked on a path which many old democracies  have  taken,  namely,  the
civilian oversight of  our  intelligence  services  by  our  Joint  Standing
Committee on Intelligence and the Inspector-General of Intelligence.

One of the many challenges that we faced as the JSCI was to find  the  right
person to fill the position of the  Inspector-General.  In  addition,  there
were insufficient regulations to govern  the  functions  of  the  Inspector-
General and to provide for the appointment  of  suitable  personnel  to  the
Office of the IG.

I am satisfied, as a member of the  JSCI,  that  the  Intelligence  Services
Control Amendment Bill now addresses all previous shortcomings. The ACDP  is
also in full support that the President should appoint only  one  Inspector-
General. In the past few years, the JSCI has debated at length the issue  of
keeping  costs  down  without  compromising  the  quality  of  oversight  of
intelligence services. The appointment of  a  single  Inspector-General,  if
the right candidate can  be  found,  will  not  compromise  the  quality  of
oversight. More does not necessarily mean better.

Regarding the Electronic Communications Security (Pty) Ltd  Bill  or  Comsec
Bill, we are living in a fast-changing modern world where the latest  state-
of-the-art computer chips become redundant within three to six months  after
being released. As a result, intelligence services throughout the world  are
taking precautions  against  sophisticated  computer  hackers,  unauthorised
persons who have the ability to access  sophisticated  state  computers  and
who can crack computer passwords  and  codes  with  equipment  that  can  be
bought at any local computer shop. It is therefore important for  the  state
to take preventive action and remain  at  the  cutting  edge  of  electronic
communications. Hence the need for the Comsec Bill.

If Comsec has, as one of its objectives, the development of the  ability  to
stop hackers gaining valuable and  sensitive  state  information,  then  the
company becomes  vital  in  protecting  critical  electronic  communication.
There seems to be scepticism in the state's intention in creating a  private
company to combat cybercrime. We do not want to do this.  However,  we  will
monitor the outcome and the process.

Finally, the ACDP supports all four intelligence Bills.

Mr R D PIETERSE: Madam Speaker, hon members, if  the  hon  Vos  was  at  the
meetings maybe we would have had more  time  for  her,  and  a  much  better
debate.
Ek kan seker maar sê, mooi, Martha! Mooi so! [I  suppose  I  may  say:  Well
done, Martha, well done!]

Sometimes it is important to inform people that just because they  serve  on
a particular committee, it does  not  mean  they  have  the  sole  right  to
intelligence matters. The hon Olckers is right  when  she  says  that  these
members might be questioning their own members who  represent  them  in  the
committees. It was not a swipe at us but rather at their own members.

When we retire, whether from the police or the army, it  is  also  important
that we should not retire our brains as well and  be  frightened  about  all
kinds of issues. It is silly to be scared  just  because  one  has  retired.
People should keep their brains active. This Government will never  give  up
its responsibility to ensure the safety of South Africans. It did not do  so
in the past, and will never do so in future.

As we debate these four pieces of legislation, let us  not  be  reckless  in
our objection to or rejection of them but rather  take  a  global  approach,
keeping in mind particularly the safety of our children.  November  is  also
the month of  the  child  in  our  Letsema  campaign.  This  Bill  seeks  to
establish  a  company  to  provide  electronic  communication  products  and
matters that are connected to organs of state. This company will  be  called
Comsec. This will be an ordinary company doing  extraordinary  things.  This
company, from time to  time,  will  require  to  be  exempted  from  certain
provisions of the Company's Act. This request will be forthcoming  from  the
company to the Minister of Trade and Industry and must be fully motivated.

The Registrar of Companies will publish such requests with  full  motivation
by notice in the Gazette. Such companies  are  not  unique  or  new  to  the
democratic  world.  In  terms  of  international  standards,  quite  a   few
countries have  established  such  companies  long  before  we  even  had  a
democratic Government. It is also imporant to note that this company  called
Comsec will not be  in  competition  with  any  service  provider  including
Telkom, Easytel and Transtel. Representatives of  Transtel  and  Telkom  can
rest easily and in peace tonight.

I want to inform Mr Bowman and Mr  Maphelo  that  this  company  is  not  in
competition, and it will not be in competition.

Daarom is daar geen rede tot kommer of bemoeienis, of selfs  tot  kompetisie
nie. Dit sal 'n suiwer Suid-Afrikaanse maatskappy wees wat met die beste  in
die wêreld kan  saamgesels.  Hierdie  maatskappy  sal  deur  'n  raad,  soos
aangestel deur die Minister  van  Kommunikasie,  ná  oorlegpleging  met  die
Kabinet, bestuur en beheer word. Hierdie raadslede sal  vir  'n  termyn  van
ongeveer drie jaar aangestel word, maar dit sal ook deur  die  Minister  van
Intelligensie  aangepas  kan  word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[There  is  therefore  no  reason  for  concern  or   interfence   or   even
competition. This will be a purely South African company that will  be  able
to hold their own against the best  in  the  world.  This  company  will  be
administered  and  managed  by  a  board  appointed  by  the   Minister   of
Communications after consultation with the  Cabinet.  The  members  of  this
board will be appointed for a period of approximately three years, but  this
can also be adjusted by the Minister of Intelligence.]

Initially, Comsec will be funded through grants and  funds  from  Parliament
as part of the Vote on Intelligence Services.  Comsec  will  be  allowed  to
acquire shares from any other  company  registered  in  South  Africa,  thus
becoming less dependent on  grants  and  funds.  It  is  also  important  to
address some of the concerns. If one looks at the IT shares, only  a  idiot,
a person who does not have all his brain cells, will go  and  invest  in  IT
shares now. One has to give space for this company to look  where  they  can
invest and ensure that returns are the best they can  be.  People  who  will
lead Comsec are people of integrity who will  not waste money, and who  have
the best interest of the country and company at heart.

We cannot allow party politics and concerns about the necessary  funding  to
prevent Comsec from running on  all  cylinders  and  provide  the  necessary
protection  in  terms  of  telecommunications  and   other   functions.   As
prevention is better than cure, Comsec will be the prevention  that  we  all
aspire for.

The Freedom Charter states that this beautiful country  belongs  to  all  of
us, black and white. Let us keep this country safe and  secure  for  all  of
us, black and white. Let us put prevention first.

Allow me to thank the chairperson and the committee as well  as  the  staff.
Let me also take this opportunity to thank two outstanding  cadres  of  this
country. Our future is indeed in  good  hands.  I  thank  you  Takalani  and
Dennis. A very special thanks goes to  the  DG  of  the  Communications,  Dr
Andile Xaba.

Die ANC  steun  hierdie  vier  stukke  wetgewing  sonder  enige  voorbehoud.
[Applous.] [The ANC  supports  these  four  pieces  of  legislation  without
reservation.] [Applause.]]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson  and  the  hon  the  Minister,  in  view  of  the
Intelligence Services Control Amendment Bill, the MF is pleased to note  the
department is on guard to review and fill in the loopholes  in  the  sector.
Accountability is one of the most important factors of our  Government.  The
clarity with which the amending Bill serves to address the  matter  and  the
duties of the control mechanics over the sector is seen as necessary and  in
line with national standards.

The amending Bill on national strategic intelligence establishes strong  co-
ordination of the intelligence sector by the Minister  and  Nicoc.  However,
the MF agrees that though oversight has to be maintained  by  the  Minister,
the independence of Nicoc from this office  is  necessary.  The  proper  co-
ordination of the intelligence sector is very important to the  security  of
the nation as a whole.

As  stated  above,  the  co-ordination  of  this  sector  is  crucial.   The
Intelligence  Services  Bill  appears  to  provide   greater   clarity   and
management on  a  number  of  matters  within  the  sector,  especially  the
provisions to regulate the unemployment and retirement of  persons  employed
in the intelligence sector. The MF finds this necessary.

The national intelligence services work hard to  better  the  lives  of  all
South Africans.  The  Electronic  Communications  Security  (PTY)  Ltd  Bill
serves as another safety mechanism.

The MF feels that when a country feels safe, it feels  strong  and,  if  one
feels strong, one can work hard at being the best.

The MF supports all the above Bills. [Applause.]

Mr L T LANDERS: Chairperson, we  conduct  this  debate  in  the  shadow  and
tragic aftermath of several terrorist attacks throughout the world. I  refer
to the 11 September World Trade Centre  bombings,  the  terrorist  bombs  in
Bali, Indonesia, the hostage drama that has just  played  itself  out  in  a
theatre in Moscow, the  arrest  of  the  sniper  who  terrorised  people  in
Washington, Maryland and Virginia in the  USA,  and,  closer  to  home,  the
bombings in Soweto yesterday. We share in the sentiments  already  expressed
in this regard. We also conduct this debate in  the  face  of  the  probable
declaration of war on Iraq in order to change the regime  in  that  country.
All these events  bring  added  significance  to  our  debate  on  the  four
intelligence Bills before this House.

The policy of the ANC  is  to  make  South  Africa's  intelligence  services
efficient, effective and yet accountable, so that the tragic events  I  have
referred to can, perhaps, be prevented. The four Bills  before  this  House,
read together with the Regulation  of  Interception  of  Communications  and
Provision of Communication-related Information Bill  -  otherwise  known  as
the Interception and Monitoring Bill - which is before the NCOP, comprise  a
package of laws that seek  to  make  our  intelligence  services  efficient,
effective and yet accountable, such that the provisions of our  Constitution
are complied with. The package of Bills also seeks to address  the  enormous
leaps made in technological fields.

A strong and unique feature of our  intelligence  system  lies  in  the  co-
ordination of that  system.  It  has  been  proven  that  most  intelligence
failures that occur in countries of the world do so because of the lack  of,
or through, inadequate co-ordination.  Whilst  the  co-ordination  of  South
Africa's  intelligence  services  is  much  admired  throughout  the  world,
particularly given events subsequent  to  11  September,  careful  attention
still needs to be given to this aspect. The package  of  intelligence  Bills
before this House, read together with the Interception and Monitoring  Bill,
seek to achieve an improved co-ordination of  our  intelligence  system.  In
this way, greater efficiency and accountability will also  be  achieved.  We
are satisfied that this objective will be realised  through  the  provisions
of the package of Bills before us.

Clauses 27, 28 and 29 of the intelligence services  Bill  seek  to  regulate
the activities of former members of the intelligence  services  in  relation
to their  disclosure  of  information,  their  employment  in  the  security
industry, which is  restricted  to  a  period  of  three  years,  and  their
communication with former  colleagues,  representatives  of  South  Africa's
intelligence services or foreign intelligence services in a manner  that  is
likely to compromise national security. These three clauses have come to  be
reffered to as the ``restraint of trade'' clauses. An  important  aspect  of
clause 28 is that it will be applied retroactively.

Restraint of trade in the intelligence  services  is  an  international  and
national phenomenon. Indeed, the  practice  is  also  used  by  the  Central
Intelligence Agency  of  the  USA,  amongst  others.  For  example,  we  are
reminded that Stella Remington, former head of Britain's MI5, first  had  to
obtain the approval and clearance of both MI5 and MI6 before her book  could
be published. Indeed, Stella Remington's book was  thoroughly  screened  and
scrutinised by both MI5 and MI6 so as  to  ensure  that  Britain's  national
security and her interests were in  no  way  compromised.  Our  approval  of
clause 28 is in keeping with international best practices, and  we  want  to
say that these clauses are long overdue.
Very briefly, I want to address  some  of  the  criticisms  that  have  been
levelled at, particularly, the Electronic Communications Security (PTY)  Ltd
Bill, also known as the Comsec Bill, by some members in the debate  and,  in
particular, from the DA. The hon Van Schalkwyk stated, among  other  things,
that private companies have complained that Comsec will  be  encroaching  on
their turf. The factual  position  is  that  objections  and  concerns  were
raised by two organisations and one individual. The two  organisations  were
firstly Telkom and then Transtel and Eskom. Transtel and Eskom, and  Telkom,
are state-owned enterprises and not  private  organisations.  A  significant
aspect of the concerns and objections raised by  Telkom  and  Transtel,  and
one that was seriously lacking, was the fact that they did not  address  the
crucial need for national security in Government electronic  communications.


Perhaps I need to pause here and place before the House an  issue  that  has
bothered me for some time now. I have heard hon members engage in debate  on
these matters before and I have always been of the view that  South  Africa,
this Parliament, needs a wide-ranging national debate on the issue  and  the
concept of national security. I  have  my  own  views  about  what  national
security stands for. It may not necessarily be the same as that of  our  hon
Minister. Are my views on national security of necessity the same  as  those
of the hon Farouk Cassim and the hon Mr Ellis? We need to have  this  debate
so that, as South Africans, we have a common understanding of what  national
security stands for, so that in future, when the Government  in  the  person
of the Minister of  Intelligence  comes  before  this  House  and  tables  a
measure that seeks to enhance national security, we  depart  from  a  common
premise of what national security stands for. Until we have  done  that,  we
will have the problems that we have experienced this afternoon.

Many of the concerns put forward by both Telkom and Transtel were, in  fact,
addressed by the ad hoc committee. Of course, we  did  not  agree  with  all
their concerns and objections, but that is what  democracy  is  about.  More
importantly, however, the positions put forward  by  these  two  state-owned
enterprises  do  not  enjoy  the  support   of   the   Director-General   of
Communications. I know for a fact that he  is  extremely  annoyed  with,  in
particular, the position put forward  by  Telkom.  This  leaves  me  with  a
question that remains unanswered to date, namely: Exactly whose interest  do
Telkom and Transtel seek to promote? We remain convinced that  the  creation
of Comsec will not only legalise the function that has always  been  carried
out by the National Intelligence Agency,  but  that  the  Comsec  Bill  will
merely formalise that situation and we welcome this progression.

In conclusion, we commend these Bills to this House. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR INTELLIGENCE: Chairperson, at this late hour  of  the  day,
all that remains for me is to thank everybody who took part in this  debate.


However, before I conclude, I would especially like  to  thank  the  General
from the DA, the hon Brig Gen P J Schalkwyk, for his  very  good  input.  It
has become quite clear that what he was outlining is what  happened,  namely
that the briefings took place during recess and he could  not  consult  with
his colleagues. In fact, when they did finally catch up with what was  being
discussed, they were completely at sea about  what  was  happening.  We  are
offering to have a special session to educate the DA  about  these  matters,
because it is absolutely important that we do. It was made  quite  clear  to
me when I heard the hon Sheila Camerer consistently shrieking: ``What  about
Sita? What about Sita?'' It was quite clear that she did  not  understand  a
thing about this, because Comsec is indeed billed under the same concept  as
Sita. The very Sita which we agreed to is what we are now seeking to  effect
for intelligence and communications.

However, this is an open invitation and we would like  to  have  interaction
with the DA in the most honest way we can. It  is  important  that  they  be
educated and brought on board on the same level as we are.  [Interjections.]
I would like to ...

Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER: They need to be taught from  scratch.  We  have  dragged  them
screaming from where they were. They are getting as close as  they  can  and
we can drag them closer. [Interjections.]

With the kind of support that we received from the House today,  the  burden
now lies on the intelligence services to be the  world-class  service  which
we seek to build. With this wind behind them, they  dare  not  fail  us.  In
fact, they will not fail us. [Applause.]

                          GAS REGULATOR LEVIES BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Mr Chairperson and hon members, because it is late  in  the
day, we do not intend keeping hon members here for too long.

The Gas Act, Act 48 of 2001,  was  assented  to  by  the  President  of  the
Republic on 12 February 2002. That Act established  a  regulatory  framework
for the emerging gas industry in our country, leading to the  signing  of  a
landmark agreement between Sasol  and  the  governments  of  Mozambique  and
South Africa to bring gas from Mozambique to our country.

The current Bill represents an important milestone in the implementation  of
the Government's vision for the energy sector.  This  will  diversify  South
Africa's energy resources, create markets, cheaper inputs and the  potential
for new large and medium gas-based industries  in  Gauteng  and  Mpumalanga,
especially in the Nelspruit and surrounding areas,  as  well  as  boost  the
Mozambican economy and further the goals of Nepad.

Since then, Sasol has made significant progress regarding the project.  They
have laid the first section of  the  pipeline  as  we  speak.  According  to
Sasol, they will create 1 500 jobs in  Mozambique  and  375  jobs  in  South
Africa during the  construction  phase.  They  will  use  approximately  600
expatriates in the process. Obviously there will be some other  permutations
during the operational phase, but that will be closely monitored.

Gas is expected to flow into this country just after the ANC  is  re-elected
in  2004.  [Interjections].  Yes,  that  is  very  true.  We  will  play   a
significant role in improving the environment, reducing unemployment and  in
ultimately  helping  South  Africa  meet   its   international   obligations
pertaining to climate change. One of the spin-offs will be  that  the  price
of the LPG will drop due to competition with natural gas. This will make  it
more affordable  for  households,  thus  mitigating  the  awful  effects  of
paraffin and other unsafe and unhealthy fuels  on  our  children  and  their
parents.

The Bill empowers the Gas Regulator to impose levies on  the  gas  industry.
The Gas Regulator  will  be  funded  in  the  same  way  that  the  National
Electricity Regulator is currently funded via a dedicated levy.  This  is  a
sound approach to the funding of regulators as it  prevents  cross-subsidies
from one industry to another. It also places less pressure  on  the  fiscus.
The levy will be charged according to the amount of  gas  entering  the  gas
networks.

I must point out here that there was a debate in  terms  of  the  system  of
measurement that must be used. We are quite  confident  that  the  regulator
and Sasol will resolve this matter. This will be proposed by  the  regulator
as part of the business plan  and  will  be  approved  by  the  Minister  of
Minerals and  Energy  after  consultation  with  stakeholders,  guaranteeing
transparency and efficiency.  The  performance  of  the  regulator  will  be
assessed at least every five years, and levies are expected  to  decline  as
the industry grows and more gas is imported.

The portfolio committee held short consultative hearings on the Bill.  There
was no major disagreement on the central principal of the Bill, namely  that
of paying levies. I must point out that there was, however, a  disagreement,
though a very small one, on the method that the regulator should  employ  in
calculating the levy. That is the point that I have already made.

There  was  also  a  complaint  from  stakeholders  concerning  a  lack   of
consultation on the Bill. I am sure that my colleague Comrade Bell, here  on
my left, will raise that matter. However, we are  satisfied  that  extensive
consultation was undertaken by the Department  of  Minerals  and  Energy  in
relation to the Gas Bill and that they gave stakeholders  adequate  time  to
make representations on these issues.

The final issue that arose was that of  merging  regulators  in  the  energy
sector. A decision has been taken to create  one  energy  regulator  out  of
separate regulators in order to rationalise the specialist skills needed  to
regulate the network industries and  build  a  stronger  capacity  base  for
regulation. This process will take a number of years  and  will  not  affect
the passing of this Bill. A landmark meeting will be held  in  Gauteng  next
week when a new African Forum for Utility Regulation  will  be  launched  as
part of the  Nepad  programme  of  sharing  and  building  capacity  on  the
continent. [Interjections.]

Finally, I would like to congratulate the Minister of  Minerals  and  Energy
and the Minister of Finance and their departments for bringing this  project
to fruition and wish them good luck with the launch of  the  regulator.  The
ANC supports this Bill. I will resist the temptation of  responding  to  the
opposition, because they might just call for a division. So  we  will  leave
it at that! [Applause.]

Mr B G BELL: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, the gas  industry
in South Africa is small but growing. Recently, we passed  the  Gas  Act  to
regularise the industry. The Bill today completes the cycle and  allows  the
state to apply a levy to all gas that is bled from a well and piped  to  the
consumer.

The Bill sets forth the procedure for applying  this  levy  to  finance  the
regulator who will have the opportunity of  controlling  the  gas  industry.
Since the Bill is a money Bill, and forms part of the Gas Act,  consultation
with stakeholders was deemed unnecessary by the state law adviser. This  has
led to some misgivings by the stakeholders who were  invited  to  the  final
discussions. This must not happen when the mineral rights  Bill  is  finally
discussed.

The major difference was the point at which the gas levy would  be  applied.
The Bill calls for the levy to be applied at the inlet  flange  of  the  gas
pipeline. This implies that as the  gas  leaves  the  well  and  enters  the
pipeline, the gas must be measured and a levy paid. It was  pointed  out  by
the stakeholders that this could take place in a  foreign  country  or  even
out at sea.
The department then announced that the levy would be  payable  only  as  the
gas was crossing the border and hence not at the inlet flange as  stated  in
the Bill. This could create a great deal of confusion. If the gas, as it  is
crossing the border, had to be measured, an arrangement  would  need  to  be
made  to  comply.  This  would  entail  a  large  capital  expense  and  the
monitoring of this installation. The cost of this would  add  to  the  final
selling price of the gas.

The alternative arrangement could be applying the levy at  the  final  stage
of the value chain. This would mean that the consumer  would  only  pay  the
levy and no incremental costs would accrue. By  applying  the  levy  at  the
beginning of the value chain, the consumer can certainly be expected to  pay
any incremental costs involved in financing  the  levy.  If  the  state,  as
hinted at, decides to apply all taxes and levies at  this  stage,  the  cost
would rise dramatically.

It was announced that Sars does intend applying  taxes  and  levies  at  the
start of the value chain, even to the petroleum industry. This will  have  a
negative effect on our fuel  prices.  During  the  discussions  on  the  Gas
Regulator Levies Bill, the department announced that the decision  had  been
taken to merge all economic regulators in the energy field.

A single body regulating all areas in the energy field  is  a  move  in  the
right direction, but the fear would relate to the management and control  of
this body. When we look at the disasters at the Diamond Board,  and  at  the
Central Energy Fund that has not been well managed and is  still  presenting
problems, it will be essential that a competent person is appointed to  this
position and be given a management team that can carry out  these  important
functions.

The DP and the DA will support this Bill, but request that the  issues  that
were raised during the discussions be clarified and, if necessary, the  Bill
be amended to suit. It is recognised that this Bill needs to  be  passed  in
order to complete the establishment of  our  very  important  gas  industry.
[Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Chairperson, I think that the hon Oliphant and hon  Bell  have
done a great job in giving us the background and I do not intend  to  repeat
any of those issues.

There are only two issues  that  really  jump  up  at  us  in  the  form  of
questions. The first  is:  Will  the  appropriate  amount  be  collected  in
levies? Secondly, will the funds so collected be properly  administered  and
used?

In going through the Bill, we are reassured  that  this  will  be  the  case
through three different mechanisms and  processes.  Firstly,  there  is  the
fact that  the  business  plan  and  the  budget  will  go  before  the  two
Ministers, the Minister of Minerals and Energy and the Minister of  Finance.
We think that it is altogether appropriate.  Secondly,  there  is  the  fact
that the levies will be annually reviewed, and thirdly  that,  as  a  listed
entity under the PFMA, all the PFMA laws and regulations apply.

We are happy that those two questions are  answered  and  we  are  happy  to
support the Bill.

Mr A H NEL: Chairperson, the Gas Regulator Levies Bill is a money Bill  that
seeks to finance the gas regulator, established by  the  Gas  Act  that  was
passed last year. As we all know,  a  money  Bill  cannot  be  amended  and,
therefore, I think that the Government must make sure that all  stakeholders
are taken on board before such a Bill comes to Parliament.

In the case of this Bill, the Department of  Minerals  and  Energy  told  us
that because there was extensive consultation with stakeholders on  the  Gas
Act, they and the state law advisers considered it sufficient  and  did  not
invite stakeholder views on this Bill. I think that was  wrong  because,  as
Sasol and others have shown, there are differences of opinion  on  where  to
impose levies, at source or on the basis of what  is  consumed  by  the  end
users.
In the light of the Cabinet approval for a single  regulator  in  future,  I
agree with the department that levies must be imposed as  near  as  possible
to source. This will keep the regulator lean and  hopefully  also  keep  the
levy small because, in the end, it is the consumer who pays anyway.

We will support the Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Chairperson and hon members, this  Bill  provides  for  the
gas  regulator  to  impose  levies  for  the  pipe  gas  industry   and   is
consequential to the Gas Act of 2001.  The  Bill  furthermore  empowers  the
Minister of Mineral and Energy and the Minister of Finance to decide on  the
imposition of all variation of levies.

Currently, Sasol is laying the first sections of a  1000  km  pipeline  that
will pump natural gas from Mozambique to South Africa. This is a  formidable
undertaking   which   will   benefit   both   countries   economically   and
environmentally. It is estimated that the first Mozambican gas  from  Temane
and Pande will reach Secunda in Mpumalanga in 2004.
It is said that gas is the cleanest burning fossil fuel. Its  emissions  are
far less than coal or oil  and  this  gives  it  an  inherent  advantage  in
environmetal fuel. The environmental benefits of switching  to  natural  gas
are considerable.

The UDM has no hesitation in supporting the Gas Regulator  Levies  Bill  and
wishes the gas regulator well in the major task that lies ahead.

Ms S  RAJBALLY:  Chairperson  and  Minister,  the  monitoring,  control  and
supervision of the gas industry is extremely  important,  besides  the  fact
that it is extermely dangerous and that the negligent management could  have
hazardous  results.  The  negligence  to  run  the  sector  efficiently  and
effectively could also result in a number of serious problems and defects.

The MF feels that the provisions made available in this  amending  Bill  are
necessary and  the  control  of  levies  in  each  part  of  management  and
transmission of the sector should be managed at its best. State revenue  and
other sources of income are not to benefit growing  bank  balances,  but  to
earnestly manage and  assist  the  proper  running  of  the  country,  as  a
constant re-assessment of each sector is made  to  provide  for  and  ensure
that the needs within the sector are addressed efficiently.

In each of these circumstances, the MF deems it necessary  that  a  body  or
mechanism be put in place to monitor the operation.

The MF supports the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE:  Chairperson,  hon  members  and  dear  friends,  I
received a note that reads:


  On behalf of all the backbenchers, hungry, thirsty,  tired,  longing  for
  their partners, husbands, wives and children, do not use your 12 minutes,
  please!

I have no intention of being held in check like this by the backbenchers.  I
merely want to thank all the parties who voted in favour. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.
