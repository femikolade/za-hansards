The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I note that  the  responsible  executive
member is not in the House.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  we  are  bringing  it  to  the
attention of the Minister that we are commencing. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! We will suspend  business  to  allow  Mr
Surty to get the Minister into the House,  but  I  believe  this  is  really
quite astounding. This is my first experience of this.

Ms  Dlulane,  could  you  call  the  Minister  in  ...  and  Mr   Ackermann?
[Laughter.] This is the new relationship between the New  NP  and  the  ANC!

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 18 - Social Development:

The MINISTER OF  SOCIAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  MECs  of
social development,  distinguished  guests,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  in  my
Budget Vote speech to the National Assembly in March this year I pledged  to
proceed with the delivery of social development  programmes  and  grants  to
the millions of poor citizens of South Africa.
I also indicated that owing to their particular needs  and  vulnerabilities,
the children of our country would be the focus of our efforts.  The  primary
theme of our work in Social Development this year has been and continues  to
be ``children first''.

In motivating this focus on children one  does  not  need  to  look  far  to
realise the critical importance of providing care and support  for  children
in South Africa. About two out of every five  South  Africans  are  children
aged younger than 18 years. Of these,  almost  half  are  poor  in  material
terms.

On 27 May the official launch of  the  week  in  Pretoria  was  attended  by
children from several  schools  and  children's  shelters  situated  in  and
around the city. The children were given the opportunity to  ask  questions,
and I was saddened to  hear  about  the  issues  that  concerned  them.  The
children voiced their concerns about sexual abuse, poverty,  hunger,  family
disintegration and their distrust of adults.

For as long as this situation exists we are obliged to  double  our  efforts
to alleviate and, ultimately, to eliminate this extreme  level  of  material
and social deprivation. We need to give children  real  hope  for  a  better
life today, and not vague ideas of a better life some time  in  the  future.
It is this urgency to address the plight of children that drives our  Social
Development programmes.

I am pleased to announce that as of this week a total of 2 103 875  children
are receiving one of the three types of  social  grants  for  children.  The
majority of children, that is about 1,9 million,  are  receiving  the  child
support grant.

I am, however, deeply concerned that many  children  who  are  eligible  for
these grants are not receiving them. The reasons  for  this  could  be  that
their parents or guardians do not know about the grants or, if they do,  are
not aware of the procedures required to access them.

We are therefore embarking on a national campaign to register all those  who
are eligible for social grants, and in the first year  of  the  campaign  we
are focusing our efforts on  children.  We  aim  to  reach  another  million
children by the end of this financial  year,  and  we  have  called  on  our
partners in various sectors of civil society to support  this  campaign.  We
are asking members of this House to be part and parcel of that campaign.

The impact of HIV on our children is  devastating.  In  many  instances  the
children of families affected by the pandemic are unable to  attend  classes
because they are obliged to take care of their parents and to take on  other
roles that their parents can no longer fulfil. The  finances  of  households
are affected  and  their  purchasing  power  is  invariably  decimated.  The
nutritional  levels  of  children  thus  decrease  and  their  physical  and
emotional health deteriorates.

Sadly, there are reports of communities that shun and  marginalise  families
affected by the disease. Such reactions are based on  irrational  fears  and
misconceptions, and, as a nation, we need to counteract these.
This year we  will  expand  our  youth  development  initiatives,  which  we
commenced under the urban renewal programme. I remain  concerned  about  the
number of children and youth awaiting trial in police  cells  and  in  adult
correctional services  institutions.  It  is  therefore  essential  that  we
expand the diversion programmes as envisaged under  the  Probation  Services
Amendment Bill and also expand secure care services and facilities.

As hon members are  aware,  the  Committee  of  Inquiry  into  Comprehensive
Social Security submitted its report to Cabinet  in  April  this  year.  The
report has been distributed for  public  comment  and  we  are  now  in  the
process of reviewing the inputs received. The recommendations  contained  in
the report have far-reaching implications for the  country  and  Government.
We will therefore be deliberating very thoroughly on the issues raised.

It is, however, imperative that we continue to improve  the  current  system
so that we meet the needs of those who are eligible for social security.  In
addition to  the  national  registration  campaign,  we  will  progressively
implement norms and standards for  social  security,  streamline  procedures
and develop the skills of social security officials.

Provinces  have  begun  to  establish  assessment  panels  to  expedite  the
processing of disability grant applications. This will alleviate the  misery
experienced by many applicants, especially those living in rural areas  with
no access to district surgeons.

Earlier  this  year,  Government  set  aside  R2  billion   to   pay   grant
beneficiaries who had been disadvantaged by the  three-month  limitation  on
the accrual of arrears. The provincial  departments  of  social  development
have begun with arrears payments for child  support  grants.  This  will  be
followed by  other  grant  types  during  the  coming  months.  Government's
decision was based on our belief that beneficiaries should not be  penalised
for the shortcomings in the legislation and  administration  of  our  social
security system. Every beneficiary who is entitled to  the  arrears  payment
will receive payment.

Many of the improvements made in the area of social security respond to  the
recommendation made by the Ministerial Committee on the Abuse,  Neglect  and
Ill-treatment  of  Older  Persons.  This  year,   we   will   expedite   the
implementation of outstanding matters raised by the  committee  as  well  as
develop a national action plan on ageing and keeping  with  the  declaration
made in the Second World Assembly on Ageing, which  was  held  in  Spain  in
April this year.

Our poverty relief programmes will place  increasing  emphasis  on  building
and strengthening community  structures  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of
poverty relief initiatives. This will require  us  to  work  collaboratively
with other departments as well as local government in the  manner  envisaged
by the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme.

The National Development Agency, NDA, was transferred to  my  Ministry  late
last year and is expected to  play  a  critical  role  in  supporting  civil
society organisations in the  fight  against  poverty.  We  established  365
projects last year and  have  already  established  52  this  year.  In  the
current financial year, the poverty relief allocation has  doubled  to  R100
million.

We will continue with  our  efforts  to  support  the  social  and  economic
empowerment of women. The Women's Flagship  Programme  is  gaining  momentum
and is showing signs of sustainability. The programme has  been  rolled  out
in all provinces and there are  22  projects.  To  complement  the  flagship
programme,  104  women's  income  generation   projects   have   also   been
established to benefit 10 400 households.

The Victim Empowerment  Programme  provides  support  to  women  victims  of
domestic violence and the department works closely with  the  Department  of
Justice and Constitutional Development and the  SA  Police  Service  on  all
forms of violence against women.

The theme of partnership is an important one in many areas  of  our  service
delivery. In achieving the objectives of the  ambitious  programmes  of  the
department, we count on the support of many civil society partners.

I take this opportunity to thank the business sector and the numerous faith-
based and nongovernmental organisations that have responded to our call  for
support. Their efforts and generosity are making a difference to  the  lives
of many of our people.

I know that there are many ordinary citizens right across this  country  who
share our concern about the plight of poor  people  and  children.  Many  of
these people work tirelessly and often on a voluntary basis, and I  am  most
appreciative of their commitment. There is still much more to be done and  I
appeal to others to join hands with us to become part  of  the  solution  to
the challenges we face.

I  would  like  to  remind  all  organisations  that  receive  funding  from
Government that they must comply with the requirements  for  accounting  and
reporting  on  the  funds  that  they   receive   from   Government.   These
accountability  requirements  apply   equally   to   large   nongovernmental
organisations and to small community-based organisations. They have a  legal
and moral responsibility to spend taxpayers' money  on  the  programmes  for
which they receive the funding.  The  national  and  provincial  departments
make extensive use of consultants, and I am concerned that  the  quality  of
work delivered does not represent value for money  for  Government.  I  also
appeal to service  providers  to  observe  the  principles  of  Batho  Pele,
especially in the payment of social grants to the elderly.

The department's allocation increased from R190 million in the year  2001-02
to R409 million in the current financial year. Most of the increase  in  the
allocation is for transfer payments to benefit communities  in  the  poverty
relief programme and in the home-based and community-based care  programmes,
and to fund the projects of the National  Development  Agency.  Funding  has
also been allocated to improve the social security system and to  strengthen
the capacity of the department.

The provinces have received an increased allocation  this  year  from  R23,9
billion to R28 billion. The allocation for social grants is  R25,2  billion,
and the grant increases took effect on 1 April  this  year.  This  increased
budget,  together  with  the  substantial  allocation  for  social   grants,
reflects the Government's commitment to the poorest sector  of  our  society
with - once again I repeat - the emphasis on children.

In conclusion, I would like to thank  my  colleagues,  the  members  of  the
executive committees  in  the  provinces,  for  their  sterling  efforts  in
implementing this very challenging programme of social development.  I  also
wish to thank the members of the select committee  of  the  NCOP  for  their
continuous guidance on important policy and legislative matters.

The children of South Africa have  hopes  and  dreams.  They  want  to  have
enough to eat, they want to go to school and they want to  live  in  a  safe
and caring environment. They ask for nothing more  than  their  basic  human
rights. We have a moral and legal duty to ensure  that  our  children  enjoy
their human rights and live to become good citizens. We must  work  together
to make South Africa a place for children. Children's rights are also  human
rights. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs present - I see quite a few  -
representatives from  various  provinces  and  members,  this  debate,  just
opened by the hon the Minister, takes place, significantly, in the month  of
June. I say ``significantly'' because on 1 June we celebrated  International
Children's Day, the day on which the world recommits  itself  to  fulfilling
the rights of every  child  as  enshrined  in  the  Children's  Charter  and
adopted by most, if not all, countries across the globe.

Secondly, it is also the month in which we celebrate the youth  of  this  of
this country and enter into dialogue with them  on  how  best  to  socially,
economically and  politically  enable  them  to  become  the  respected  and
responsible adults of tomorrow. The theme for this  debate  is,  once  more,
``Pushing back the frontiers of poverty'', with the specific focus on  child
poverty.

Section 28(1) of the Constitution  deals  with  the  fundamental  rights  of
children.  Unlike  other  socioeconomic  rights,  which   are   subject   to
progressive realisation by the  state  with  its  available  resources,  the
rights pertaining to children do not have any such limitations. The  special
vulnerability of children and their protection is, in this way,  recognised.
This section grants children the following core rights: firstly,  the  right
to family or parental care or  alternative  care  when  removed  from  their
family environment; secondly, the right to basic nutrition, shelter,  health
care and social services; and thirdly, the right  to  be  protected  against
maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation.

According to  the  studies  done  by  Acess,  the  Alliance  for  Children's
Entitlement  to  Social  Security,  an  estimated  amount  of  10,5  million
children live in adverse conditions of poverty; one in every  four  children
have stunted growth due to a nutritional disorder; and Limpopo, the  Eastern
Cape, Mpumalanga  and  KwaZulu-Natal  have  amongst  the  highest  rates  of
poverty.

On Monday, the Minister opened  an  international  conference  on  youth  or
children in conflict with the law, which was held in Port Elizabeth. In  his
address to the  conference,  he  stated  that  there  were  currently  1 789
children under the age of 18  serving  prison  sentences  in  South  African
jails, and a further 2 322 were being held at places of  safety  and  secure
care. Out of this total of more than 4 000 children, 40% are being held  for
economic crimes such as theft. It  is  indeed  sad  that  children  have  to
resort to crime to feed themselves and to generally  just  survive.  One  of
the measures put in place by the department to address child poverty and  to
broaden access to social security was the child  support  grant,  which  the
Minister mentioned.

A provincial breakdown of children accessing the child support grant, as  of
May 2002 is as follows: the Eastern Cape, 149 953; the Free State,  105 309;
Gauteng, 204 705;  KwaZulu-Natal,  495 055;  Limpopo,  300 392;  Mpumalanga,
131 586; the Northern Cape,  34 756;  the  North  West,  164  043;  and  the
Western Cape, 149 953. This gives us a total of about  1,8  million, but  it
might be slightly more at this point in time.

Unfortunately, we cannot furnish this House with statistics  of  the  number
of eligible children qualifying for this grant currently,  but  we  do  know
that a large portion of eligible children,  for  various  reasons,  are  not
able to access this grant. The Minister also touched on  some  the  possible
reasons why this is not happening. The take-up rate seems to  be  higher  in
the better-resourced provinces and lower  in  provinces  with  high  poverty
levels. In the  Eastern  Cape  and  Limpopo,  one  in  every  five  eligible
children access the child support grant, whereas in  the  Western  Cape  and
Gauteng, for every three children  targeted  two  are  receiving  the  child
support grant.

One of the most common reasons given for this discrepancy is  the  existence
of an administrative problem - namely, that most  children  who  do  qualify
for the child support grant do not have the  necessary  documentation,  like
birth certificates, or their parents do not have IDs.  In  this  regard,  we
want to recommend that the hon the Minister initiate  discussions  with  his
Home  Affairs  counterpart  to   facilitate   the   speedy   processing   of
identification documents and the introduction of mobile units to  cater  for
the far-flung rural areas in our country like  the  Eastern  Cape,  Limpopo,
Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.

Despite these constraints, we  also  want  to  commend  the  department  for
embarking on a national campaign to register all  eligible  social  security
beneficiaries and the payment of arrears accrued to  them,  the  replacement
of the Socpen system, the introduction of a training  programme  for  social
security  officials,  the  implementation  of  norms  and   standards,   the
implementation of a programme of monitoring and auditing  and  the  possible
introduction of legislation emerging from the committee of inquiry's  report
which the Minister has referred to. This, we feel, will go  a  long  way  in
alleviating the plight of our children living in poverty-stricken homes,  in
informal settlements and on the streets.

When we look at social security for  children,  it  is  not  just  the  sole
responsibility of the  Department  of  Social  Development,  but  rather  an
intersectoral  responsibility  of  a  number  of   Government   departments.
Comprehensive social security for children comprises a package  of  services
and benefits. For example, access  to  health  care,  education,  nutrition,
water, sanitation, housing, etc. It must also provide for the special  needs
arising from chronic health conditions in a compromised  home  situation  to
ensure survival and a standard of living adequate for their development.

We therefore want to recommend  that  when  policy  and  legislation  around
comprehensive social security are looked  at,  the  inputs  from  all  these
departments and recommendations from the committee of inquiry,  as  well  as
the recommendations from the report of Acess  and  the  child  participation
process, are incorporated.

No debate would be complete without a reference to  HIV  and  Aids  and  the
impact they have on our children.  Children  on  a  daily  basis  are  being
orphaned by Aids and  are  expected  to  head  households  for  their  minor
siblings. We are encouraged to note that additional  funding  has  been  set
aside to alleviate the plight of those affected by this scourge.

For the financial year 2002-03 the department has allocated a  total  amount
of  R46,5  million  to  expand  the  home-based  and  community-based   care
programme, including the support of sites  identified  in  rapid  appraisal,
the improvement of information on children and families  affected,  and  the
expansion of training programmes to include faith-based organisations,  NGOs
and CBOs.

The biggest allocation goes to provinces  reported  as  having  the  highest
prevalence rate, namely, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Gauteng. We  want  to
commend the department for the allocation of money according  to  priorities
and needs, especially since the number of vulnerable children will  increase
dramatically because of HIV and Aids.

In  conclusion  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Minister,  his  departmental
officials, led by the director-general - some of  them  are  in  the  public
gallery  up  there  -  and  his  parliamentary  liaison  officer  for  their
unwavering assistance and support, especially around this time of the  year,
when we review and debate our policy directions.

I hope that all the comments and contributions that follow will be taken  in
the spirit that they are meant to create a better life for all  our  people,
especially for  the  future  builders  and  leaders  of  this  country,  our
children. A special word of thanks  also  goes  to  the  thousands  of  foot
soldiers in  the  employ  of  the  department,  based  in  our  offices  and
communities around  the  country,  who  are  committed  to  quality  service
delivery to the poor and most vulnerable.

I submit and propose to the House, on behalf of the  select  committee,  the
adoption of Budget Vote 18 for 2002-03. [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs and hon members, let  me
start by congratulating the national leader of  the  New  NP  Marthinus  van
Schalkwyk,  on  his  election  as  Premier  of  the  Western   Cape   today.
[Applause.]

Recent statistics show that an estimated  26,9  million  people  are  living
below the absolute poverty line. It is estimated by Statistics South  Africa
that the unemployment rate is in  the  vicinity  of  37%.  It  is  therefore
abundantly clear that one of the greatest challenges  of  the  postapartheid
era is the alleviation and eradication of the  legacy  of  poverty  and  the
creation of a social development  system  that  is  able  to  develop  human
capacity within communities  that  are  self-reliant  within  a  caring  and
enabling society.

The fight against poverty can never be that of the Government alone. It  has
to be an effort by those of us who really understand and are in  touch  with
the desperate situation that the poorest of the  poor  find  themselves  in.
Poverty destroys human dignity. We believe that it is critical to  create  a
society that will accord all our citizens simple human dignity. In  all  the
facets of our national life we need to embrace a  new  and  inclusive  South
Africanism aimed at achieving unity  of  purpose  in  ridding  us  from  the
shackles that are still holding us and preventing us  from  growing  to  our
full potential as a nation.

We should all be committed to the agenda of social  transformation  that  is
embodied in  the  principle  of  social  justice  and  the  Bill  of  Rights
contained in our Constitution. We must endeavour to  create  a  better  life
for the poor, vulnerable and excluded people in our society.

Our task should be to reduce poverty  and  promote  social  integration.  We
need to develop and monitor the implementation of social policies that  both
create an enabling environment and lead to a reduction in poverty.  We  must
ensure the provision of social protection and  social  welfare  services  to
all our people who are in need of such services.

The New NP is satisfied with the  key  objectives  that  the  Department  of
Social Development has identified, which are the mitigation  of  the  social
and economic impact of HIV/Aids on poor households and  children,  achieving
progressive realisation  of  children's  social  and  economic  rights,  and
rebuilding families and communities  through  programmes  empowering  young,
old, disabled people and women.

Die Nuwe NP verbind en beywer ons daarom om armoede  te  verlig  en  uit  te
wis.  Ons  sal  alles  in  ons  vermoë  doen  om  die  agb  Minister,  LUKs,
departemente en plaaslike regerings te help in dié verband. Die Nuwe  NP  is
'n party van dade, nie soos die DP wat net praat om kiesers te  kry  en  nie
na hul belange omsien nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Wat skokkend  is,  is  dat  die
DP/DA-beheerde unistad se raad net by planne bly en die  implementering  van
hul program vir armoedeverligting nog nie in sig is nie. Die winter is  hier
en nog steeds is niks gedoen  deur  die  stadsraad  nie.  Baie  van  ons  in
hierdie Huis ervaar en ken armoede op sy laagste vlak. Ek weet  nie  of  die
DA armoede ken nie, want as hulle dit geken en ervaar het,  sal  hulle  saam
met die Regering die pad loop om armoede uit te wis en op te hou  kritiseer.


Toe die vorige  burgemeester  armoedeverligting  sy  eerste  prioriteit  wou
maak, toe het die DA se nasionale leier, Tony Leon, gesê hy het vertroue  in
die   burgemeester   verloor,   net   omdat   hy   armoede    wow    uitwis.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Die DA gee nie om vir ons arm mense nie, daarom beveg hulle  alle  programme
wat die Regering en sy vennote van stapel wil stuur. Die Nuwe NP wil en  sal
die Minister, ons plaaslike  Minister,  LUKs  en  die  departement  help  om
hierdie euwel uit te wis. Ons  is  bly  dat  die  begroting  konsentreer  op
verskeie aspekte om ons mense te help,  en  spesifiek  ons  kinders  en  ons
jeug. Voorwaarts in die  stryd  teen  armoede!  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We, the New NP, therefore  commit  ourselves  and  strive  to  relieve  and
alleviate poverty. We will do everything in our power to assist the hon  the
Minister, MECs, departments and local governments in this  regard.  The  New
NP is a party of action, unlike the DP  that  just  talks  to  gain  voters,
without looking after their interests. [Interjections.] What is shocking  is
that the DP/DA-controlled unicity council stagnates at  the  planning  stage
while the implementation of their poverty alleviation programme  is  nowhere
in sight. Winter is here and  still  nothing  has  been  done  by  the  city
council. Many of us in this House experience and know poverty at its  lowest
level. I don't know whether the DA knows poverty, because if they had  known
and experienced it, they would stop criticising and join the  Government  in
walking the road to wiping out poverty.

When the former mayor wanted to make poverty alleviation his first  priority
the  DA's  national  leader,  Tony  Leon,  claimed  that  he  had  lost  his
confidence in the mayor,  just  because  he  wanted  to  wipe  out  poverty.
[Interjections.]

The DA do not care about our poor, that is why they  oppose  all  programmes
that the Government and its partners want to launch. The New NP will and  is
going to assist the hon the Minister,  our  local  Minister,  MECs  and  the
department  to  wipe  out  this  evil.  We  are  pleased  that  the   budget
concentrates on different aspects of  helping  our  people,  especially  our
children and youth. Onwards in the struggle against poverty! [Applause!]

Mr M L  FRANSMAN  (Western  Cape):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  MECs,  hon
members, comrades and friends, during  the  last  few  years  of  our  young
democracy, the previous government of the Western Cape had  an  attitude  of
going it alone. Attempts were made  to  showcase  the  Western  Cape  as  an
alternative to the rest of the country. Yes,  indeed,  an  island  mentality
started to creep in.

Fortunately all this came to an end on 5 December 2001  with  the  formation
of a new provincial government between the ANC  and  the  New  NP.  The  new
government is built on the foundation that this province is part and  parcel
of the rest of Africa and South Africa, that we are  aligning  our  policies
and programmes to those of the national Government and that we will not,  do
not want to and shall not go it alone. Hence we have taken up the  challenge
posed by the President on 8 January  2002  and  accepted  that  the  Western
Cape's two critical challenges are tackling racism and poverty.

On the eve of the World Summit for Sustainable Development,  the  launch  of
the African Union and Nepad, we all understand that the greatest  threat  to
our success as a nation and continent is poverty. We also  understand  that,
in social development, whatever we  do  to  address  the  wellbeing  of  our
people, and in particular to provide them with a safety  net  for  survival,
we have to address poverty.

Moreover we need a vision that  will  guide  us  to  building  strength  and
stability in our communities. I believe that  vision  is  crystallising  and
gaining momentum, and the Minister's budget points the way  forward  for  us
in our provinces.

I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister's approach that our first  priority
is that of children. Children remain the  most  vulnerable  members  of  our
society and are those who we have the greatest duty to protect.  It  is  our
responsibility as adults to create an environment where  children  can  just
be children. In a situation where the  child  support  grant,  at  R130  per
month, makes a very significant  impact  on  the  quality  of  life  of  the
poorest children, we must surely concentrate our efforts where there is  the
greatest need.

In the Western Cape, I have prioritised key areas  of  focus  which  include
the registration of people eligible  for  grants;  the  abuse  of  children,
women and the elderly;  implementing  the  UN  and  national  programmme  of
action for the aged; strengthening the provincial programme  of  action  for
children; strategy around street children, with  the  key  emphasis  on  re-
integrating them into society; and the accessibility  of  our  services  and
the integration thereof.

At  the  opening  of  Parliament  the  President  called   for   a   massive
registration drive with regard to social security benefits. We  have  heeded
that call and successful registration campaigns have  been  launched  around
the intake of grants in poor African and coloured communities.

Let me illustrate this. We are this month already exceeding 160 000 and,  at
current projections, we could exceeded 195 000 by the end of  the  financial
year. As can be seen, we have taken up those challenges and we will  deliver
on them. We understand the need for delivery at this pace  and  support  the
Minister in  that  vision  of  a  self-reliant  society.  Obviously  we  are
struggling with balancing the need with the available funds in our budget.

Of course the child support  grant  is  not  the  be  all  and  end  all  of
addressing the needs of children. Today the Minister will bring to  a  close
Child Protection Month in the Western Cape, which is an  extended  programme
of the national Child Protection Week held at the end of  May  2002.  I  can
also just mention  that  even  our  soccer  team,  Bafana  Bafana,  will  be
supportive of this programme  as  far  as  the  protection  of  children  in
Khayelitsha is concerned today.

The Minister's focus on protecting our children so that we  create  a  world
fit for children will also find expression in the Western Cape  through  the
coming into being of the Commissioner for Children  in  this  province.  The
legislation will be passed this year and by next  year  we  will  appoint  a
commissioner who will look specifically at the wellbeing of children.

As I mentioned, we are prioritising in terms of the greatest  need  so  that
we target the most vulnerable in society for  intervention.  Accordingly  we
have not concentrated on the child support  grant  at  the  expense  of  the
other grants. For example, our disability grant numbers have grown by  about
20 000 since March this year. The total number of beneficiaries  across  all
the categories has grown from March 2002 to June 2002  by  approximately  50
000 recipients. Quite clearly the need  in  our  communities  out  there  is
great and we have an obligation to reach all of them.

Building a caring society is not only about money,  but  also  about  values
that we, as a society, create.  We  in  the  Western  Cape  finally  have  a
representative government that can address the needs of our people.  It  has
now adopted an overtly pro-poor approach that orientates Government  towards
the poor by ensuring basic services, an indigent policy, a safety net and  a
caring budget. Four key focus areas have been identified,  namely  HIV/Aids,
unemployment, crime, and poverty.

Through the appointment  of  our  development  quality  assurance,  or  DQA,
officials we believe we will be able to make an impact assessment  of  money
and projects that NGOs, CBOs and institutions receive. A  closer  monitoring
of the deracialisation process at old age homes  is  taking  place.  When  I
took office it was quite clear that especially our African  areas  were  not
being given the services they deserve.  Corrective  steps  have  been  taken
through the opening of a pension payout point at Brown's Farm in Philippi.

Here I wish to agree entirely with the Minister that it is about values  and
the kind of society we create. No matter the amount of  money  we  spend  on
social grants and  development,  if  it  is  not  based  on  a  moral  order
underpinned by values, we will not succeed.  Accordingly,  we  will  provide
our  unqualified  support  to  the   moral   regeneration   initiatives   of
Government.  Our  beneficiaries  must  believe  that  we  have  their   best
interests at heart, otherwise they will walk away from our initiatives.

This finds its starkest expression in how beneficiaries are treated  in  the
processing of their applications at  pension  payout  points.  I  must  once
again commend the Minister for his insight in making this a priority.
In the Western Cape we have declared war on the backlogs. We have  virtually
eliminated our backlogs and currently we process an  application  within  35
working days. I have already set a new target of 25  working  days.  We  are
proud that we can process a disability grant for severe  HIV/Aids  sufferers
within five working days.

We are also especially proud that we  have  in  this  month  awarded  a  R10
million tender to ECS, a joint venture company between  Siemens  and  MKMVA,
the uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans'  Association,  to  convert  all  our
files into electronic registries. We will,  in  due  course,  eliminate  the
lost-file syndrome as well.

As I indicated at the very outset, we cannot deal with any issue  in  social
development without  understanding  that  we  have  to  do  it  against  the
backdrop of severe poverty. The Minister is therefore commended  for  having
had the NDA transferred to his department.

Whilst the NDA had previously been marginalised in  our  province,  we  have
now opened the way for it to take centre stage. In May of this year the  NDA
met the Western Cape government and was recognised as a key  stakeholder  in
this province. Moreover, in a similar alignment,  the  province  has  placed
the directorate that deals with  poverty  in  the  Western  Cape  within  my
department. Accordingly, I believe, there will be  greater  synergy  between
the provincial government and national Government around poverty.

My directorate will focus especially on poverty, with  regard  to  research,
poverty mapping, capacity-building, empowerment  programmes  and  short-term
and medium-term job creation opportunities. Currently, we are  developing  a
provincial  strategy  on  food  security,  dealing  with  open  state  land,
commonage and capacitating small-scale farmers. We look forward  to  working
with the Minister  on  the  poverty  relief  efforts  as  expressed  in  the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development programme  and  the  urban  renewal
programme, amongst other initiatives.

The message from the Western Cape today is that we  give  the  Minister  our
unqualified support. We believe that the Minister's budget  points  the  way
forward for us, and we will rise to the challenge to deliver to our  people.
In return, we look to the Minister, the House and  the  national  sphere  of
Government to support us in our endeavours to ensure that we deliver to  our
people in the Western Cape. [Applause.]

Ms F B MARSHOFF (Free State): Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs  present  here
this morning, hon members, to many South Africans this budget  debate,  with
specific emphasis this morning on the integrated strategy for  children  and
youth affected by and infected with  HIV/Aids,  is  significant  because  it
takes place during the month of June, a  month  that  is  dedicated  to  our
youth.

This debate also takes place a  day  after  the  International  Refugee  Day
while our memories of the plight of women, children and the youth are  still
very fresh. As a country and as a continent  we  have  a  responsibility  to
respond appropriately to the needs of  women  and  children  who  have  been
uprooted from their communities. These children and  women  are  exposed  to
poverty, abuse and disease.

Our experience of the integrated HIV/Aids strategy  in  the  Free  State  is
unique, because it marks the first inclusive major effort by  Government  to
partner with the nongovernmental sector in service delivery  in  an  attempt
to respond comprehensively to HIV/Aids.

There are many areas in which Government works with the NGO  sector  in  the
fight  against  HIV/Aids,  but  none  of  these   are   as   inclusive   and
representative as this  one.  This  programme  has  succeeded  in  involving
historically marginalised community structures in service delivery. None  of
these are as comprehensive in type of service provided  as  this  programme,
and none of these are as decentralised as this programme.

Through this programme we can state with confidence that the  department  of
social  development  in  the  Free  State  is  indeed  on  course  with  its
commitment to the mission of the White Paper on social welfare, which is  to
serve and build a self-reliant nation in partnership with all  stakeholders,
through an integrated social welfare system  which  maximises  its  existing
potential and which is equitable,  sustainable,  accessible,  people-centred
and developmental.

Building a caring and self-reliant nation is an essential ingredient in  the
process of pushing back the frontiers of poverty  in  our  communities.  The
ANC Government has always expressed its  commitment  to  the  fight  against
hunger, poverty, violence and insecurity, which have  become  the  basis  of
inequality and discrimination in our country.

For the department of social development in the Free State,  the  integrated
strategy programmes provide us  with  yet  another  weapon  to  promote  and
extend the frontiers of a democratic South Africa to include the infirm  and
the poor.

HIV/Aids is one of the  critical  issues  that  requires  serious  strategic
consideration by all of us as Government,  the  business  sector  and  civil
society in our efforts to build a genuinely  inclusive  nonracial  democracy
in our country.

A study conducted by UNAID indicates that millions  of  children  will  have
lost their parents by the  year  2005.  In  the  year  2000  the  total  was
estimated at 15,6 million children, and in 2010 the total is expected to  be
22,9 million children.

These millions of children and young people, the majority of  whom  will  be
in Sub-Saharan  Africa,  are  more  likely  to  experience  and  live  under
conditions of discrimination, poverty  and  powerlessness.  The  stigma  and
discrimination  associated  with  Aids  erodes  and   reduces   the   normal
protection that all children enjoy in  the  community,  and  makes  children
affected by and infected with Aids more exposed to abuse and neglect.

Moreover, this discrimination destroys self-worth and, hence, the  sense  of
control that any child needs in order to negotiate his  or  her  development
in his or her immediate environment.
In the South African context the burden of Aids will be felt more  intensely
by people located in the rural areas because of the poor and less  developed
infrastructure and lack of services in rural areas. It is  therefore  within
this context that our obligation  to  observe  and  protect  the  rights  of
special  groups,  such  as  children,  youth  and  women  in  terms  of  the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, Cedaw and our  Constitution,  has  to
be understood first and then directed accordingly. Rural areas do  not  have
adequate numbers of NGOs or CBOs as service providers in  order  to  augment
Government efforts.

The integrated strategy programme therefore constitutes one  of  the  policy
and  strategic  frameworks  through  which  Government  seeks  to  meet  its
obligations to children and the infirm in ways that are  cost-effective  and
accessible. Through this programme, Government,  especially  the  Department
of Social Development, is able to provide protection  and  alternative  care
for orphans of HIV/Aids without uprooting children from their  cultural  and
social neighbourhoods.
The  number  of  children  that  will  be  affected  by   HIV/Aids   clearly
demonstrates the centrality and significance of this programme  in  securing
a better future for our communities. It is a known fact that a peaceful  and
stable future  for  our  country  cannot  be  attained  without  sustainable
development and progressive upliftment of our people out  of  conditions  of
poverty and unemployment. It is equally  true  that  this  prosperity  alone
will not be sufficient to push back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  without  a
culture and a tradition of caring.

For the department of social development in the Free  State  this  programme
provides space for creative and grass-roots efforts  that  ensure  that  the
needy get care, the hungry get fed and the weak get protected and  nourished
within their local communities.

The ability and commitment to take care,  protect  and  feed  the  weak  and
vulnerable is a noble quality that should define us as  South  Africans  and
as Africans in future. It is a quality that must set us apart from our  past
as we look into the future of a prosperous African continent.

It is a known fact that the Government alone cannot  address  the  needs  of
communities that arise from the spread of HIV/Aids. To a  large  extent,  it
is with the willing support and dedication of partners in the  NGO  and  CBO
sectors that we can really turn the  tide  against  the  Aids  epidemic.  We
salute all the nongovernmental agencies that threw their weight  behind  the
immeasurable success of this programme so far.

Partnerships are, however, not without challenges  and  difficulties.  These
challenges should not generate despair, but rather motivate us  to  do  more
and to improve on our achievements. Our biggest challenge as partners is  to
move ahead and confront our obstacles as a collective however big  they  may
seem, whilst, at  the  same  time,  remaining  true  to  our  priorities  as
individual role-players.

The Department of Social Development  has  another  critical  responsibility
within this programme. It is responsible for ensuring the  availability  and
accessibility of social assistance, such  as  food  parcels  and  grants  to
families and children in need. This is an area in which more  effort  should
be made to review our legislation so that our efforts  at  preventing  fraud
and abuse are not made so tight so as to exclude cases genuinely in need  of
services.

In terms of the financing policy, which was  gazetted  in  March  1999,  the
department has a responsibility to also ensure a greater  representation  of
CBOs and other grass-roots structures among the  community  of  partners  in
service delivery. More of these structures should also benefit from  welfare
funding.

The integrated strategy programmes provide an ideal opportunity  to  achieve
this objective in the near future. However, the centralised system  for  NPO
registration does not allow for a speedy resolution of this problem.

I am, however, confident that whatever challenges this  programme  may  have
imposed upon on us, we  will  be  able  to  investigate  and  find  ways  of
responding to these so as to ensure that available  resources  are  utilised
efficiently amongst all the service providers. I am equally  confident  that
the Department of Social Development will always be  a  willing  partner  in
the search for effective solutions within this collective.

In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation for  the  support  we
have received from our colleagues, from  members  of  the  legislatures  and
from members  of  the  select  committee,  as  well  as  from  the  National
Department of Social Development in the work that has been done  this   far.
I would also like to remind hon members  that  no  matter  how  small  their
impact may be, millions of  our  people  need  the  kinds  of  interventions
members have made and they are also aware that we are committed to  creating
a better South Africa and a South Africa, fit for children. [Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  colleagues,  we  see  in  the
Estimates of National Expenditure for 2002 that the four key  objectives  of
the  Department  of  Social  Development  are  to  contribute   to   poverty
eradication; to mitigate the social and economic impact of HIV/Aids on  poor
households  and  children;  to  achieve  the  progressive   realisation   of
children's  social  and  economic  rights;  and,  to  rebuild  families  and
communities through programmes empowering young, old  and  disabled  people,
as well as women.

We see that  in  three  of  the  four  objectives  mentioned,  children  are
specifically mentioned. This tells us that our  focus  is  really  where  it
should be: on the child and poverty.

The wise words of Juvenal spring to mind, when he says:  ``It  is  not  easy
for men to rise whose qualities are thwarted by poverty.'' Here, I  want  to
substitute ``men'' with ``children''. If  the  future  of  South  Africa  is
close to our heart, this is where we should start.

Social policy should aim to create a fair and equitable society,  correcting
poverty amidst plenty.  In  the  case  of  children  in  dire  need,  it  is
essential that their basic needs are met. According to Acess - the  Alliance
for Children's Entitlement to Social Security - it  is  widely  acknowledged
that  our  social  security  system  is  noncomprehensive,  fragmented   and
inefficient. Many children fall through the gaps of existing provisions.

According to the findings of Acess, poor children between the ages of 7  and
18 are often hungry and do not have  the  means  to  access  schooling,  and
children with disabilities are not catered for by the care dependency  grant
which provides coverage for  children  with  severe  disabilities  who  need
specialised education.

Furthermore, it is clear that the school fee exemption  policy  that  allows
for poor children to be exempt from paying fees -  in  terms  of  the  South
African Schools Act - is not being applied  in  most  schools.  This  policy
should be enforced because it is the most  common  problem  experienced  and
because poor children want to attend school.

The children themselves have ideas about  improving  social  security.  They
say that  indirect  social  security,  for  example  feeding  schemes,  free
uniforms, free services and transport to school, will go a long way  towards
improving the life of a poor, hungry child.

What is, however, beyond doubt is  the  necessity  of  extending  the  child
support grant to all children under 18 years. We know that Government  could
hardly afford that amount of money, but if we  can  get  the  administration
streamlined and effective then this is not  beyond  the  budget.  There  are
still many administrative problems on which we should focus. The  difficulty
in getting identity documents, birth  certificates  and  death  certificates
poses major problems and, also, the distance that people have to  travel  to
get these documents.

Security at paypoints needs to  be  addressed.  Also,  the  inefficiency  of
staff and continual delays  in  accessing  documents  needed  to  apply  for
grants are still unjustifiable.

Laat my toe om net vir my Nuwe NP kollega in sy afwesigheid te sê: my  party
fokus op die verligting van armoede. Dit  is  nie  vir  my  nodig  om  ander
partye, of ander persone, aan te val nie. Dit is nie ons  styl  om  ons  eie
onvermoë om te groei en in regering te wees te probeer verdoesel deur  ander
mense aan te val, soos hy gedoen het, nie.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Wat doen jy nou, sussie? [Gelag.]

Me E C GOUWS: Ek antwoord net daarop.

Daar is 'n tyd vir alles, en daar is 'n tyd vir  belangriker  sake.  Hierdie
is maar sommer net so 'n dwarsklap in die verbygaan. Ek  is  seker  dat  die
Minister al talle  kere  van  hierdie  probleme  gehoor  het:  dié  van  die
gesukkel om dokumente te kry en van swak administrasie. Dit is  ook  verlede
jaar by verskeie geleenthede deur my komitee aan hom uitgewys.

Die spreekwoord sê: Rome is nie in een dag gebou nie, maar ons in  die  Oos-
Kaap sukkel, worstel  en  karring  nou  al  sewe  jaar  lank  met  dieselfde
probleme. In al die gevalle is dit altyd die kinders wat die  swaarste  kry.
Kinders wat nou in die koue winter honger, skamel geklee  en  kaalvoet  loop
op pad skool toe is 'n algemene gesig in die Oos-Kaap.

Die R100-toelaag maak wel 'n verskil in  dié  wat  dit  ontvang  se  lewens.
Hulle word ten minste nie flou by die skool van honger nie. Ek kan  vir  die
agb Minister die name van skole gee waar hierdie gesig nie die  uitsondering
is nie. Die Minister sal dan vir my herinner aan die skoolvoedingskemas  wat
hierdie voorvalle moet uitskakel. Ek kan maar net sê: dit is  die  Oos-Kaap.
Enigiets  gebeur  hier:  van  die  geld  wat  verdwyn,  tot  die  brood   en
grondboontjiebotter wat  nooit  verskyn  nie,  omdat  die  leweransiers  nie
betaal word nie.

Verder wil ek die  Minister  vertel  van  die  integriteit,  of  die  gebrek
daaraan,  van  sommige  mense  in  uitvoerende  posisies.  (Translation   of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Allow me to tell my New NP colleague in his absence  that  my
party focuses on the alleviation of poverty. It is not necessary for  me  to
attack other parties or other people. It is not our  style  to  obscure  our
own inability to grow and to be in government by attacking other people,  as
he had done.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: What are you doing now little sister? [Laughter.]

Ms E C GOUW: I am only answering to that.

There is a time for everything and  there  is  a  time  for  more  important
matters. This is but merely a slap in passing. I am sure that  the  Minister
has heard about these problems on many  occasions:  about  the  struggle  to
obtain documents and of the poor administration. This was also  pointed  out
to him by my committee on many occasions last year.

The saying goes: Rome was not built in a day, but we  in  the  Eastern  Cape
have been struggling, wrestling and continuing in  this  way  for  the  past
seven years, with the same problems. In all  the  cases  it  is  always  the
children who are suffering the most. Children going to school  in  the  cold
of winter, hungry, scantily dressed and barefoot is a common  sight  in  the
Eastern Cape.

The R100 grant is making a difference in the lives of those who receive  it.
At least they do not faint at school as a result of hunger.  I  can  mention
the names of schools to the hon Minister where this sight is  no  exception.
The Minister will then remind me of the school feeding schemes which  should
eliminate these cases. I can only say: this is the  Eastern  Cape.  Anything
happens here: from the money  that  disappears,  to  the  bread  and  peanut
butter that never appears, because suppliers are not being paid.

Furthermore, I would like to tell the Minister about the integrity,  or  the
lack thereof, of some people in executive positions.]

In the year 2000 a number of Boston  College  exchange  students  spent  six
months at Rhodes University  in  Grahamstown.  During  that  time  they  did
community service work at St Mary's Day Care  Centre  for  Abused  Children.
When they returned to the United States, they decided to  do  something  for
the poorest of the poor in Grahamstown.

These students then collected  second-hand  clothes  and  coats,  and  their
local rotary club gave them a donation to pay for the transportation  of  12
containers to Grahamstown. When these containers arrived in  Port  Elizabeth
by ship they were impounded by the Board on Tariffs and Trade  and  sent  to
Cape Town. The official reason given for the impounding was that the  proper
permits were not obtained. This was a  huge  disappointment  for  St  Mary's
because they needed the clothing urgently.

They approached the constituency member for the ruling party in  Bisho  and,
after that, officials in the Eastern Cape in a desperate  move  to  get  the
clothes. Then they came to Cape Town and asked the  Minister  of  Trade  and
Industry to intervene. In the meantime, the Good Samaritans in the US  shook
their heads in disbelief. The manager of St Mary's and the bishop said  that
all permits were  valid  and  were  obtained  timeously  and  that  all  the
paperwork was done. Yet, these poorest of the poor children have  still  not
received the warm winter clothing so badly needed.

I would like to tell the hon Minister that  we  cannot  claim  to  have  the
wellbeing of the poor at heart when we allow uncaring adults  to  behave  in
such a cruel and uncaring way by illegally withholding the clothing for  the
needy. Incidents like these illustrate the lack of caring by some people  in
the bureaucracy. This, I say to the hon Minister, must be  addressed  and  I
quote Montaigne, who said: ``The lack of wealth is easily repaired  but  the
poverty of the soul is irreparable.'' Let us keep this in mind. [Applause.]
Nkk  J  N  VILAKAZI:  Mphathisihlalo  ohloniphekileyo  neNdlu  yonke,  kithi

paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Hon Chairperson and the House  at  large,  back  home  in
KwaZulu-Natal we applaud the role that the hon the Minister plays.  We  also
applaud the role of the MEC of KwaZulu-Natal, Prince G L Zulu.

In KwaZulu-Natal the MEC that I am praising here is popularly known  as  the
MEC for pensions or for the aged, because he is the  one  on  whom  the  old
women and men rely for disability grants and old age pensions  every  month.
The MEC in KwaZulu-Natal does  not  tolerate  crooks  who  defraud  old  age
pensioners, disability grant recipients  and  all  those  who  benefit  from
these funds, especially children in the  care  of  the  aged,  Aids  orphans
amongst others.

Our MEC simply had the culprits arrested who have  been  receiving  payments
by underhand methods. Pensioners' problems are  over  now.  They  get  their
money by using a card known as a "smart card". We really applaud this  card,
because it makes it possible for the pensioner to receive his or  her  money
wherever he or she is, as long as he or she has honoured his or  her  payout
day.]

We highly commend the MEC for social development in  my  province,  KwaZulu-
Natal, for his talent and expertise in identifying and dealing with  corrupt
elements within the system in a more appropriate manner, without  any  waste
of time. Hence, the pensioners of all categories are well looked  after  and
well catered for every month.

As we all know, the Department of Social Development  is  one  of  the  main
hopes of most people who depend on it, withdrawing  money  every  month  for
survival, whether an old age or a civil pension,  or  disability  or  social
grant of whatever  nature.  This  is,  indeed,  an  overwhelming  source  of
support for all South African citizens.

We salute the national Minister of Social Development for having raised  the
child support grant, although it may not cover much  because  of  the  needs
caused by the HIV/Aids scourge in the province. Some children have all of  a
sudden become the head of the family after the death of both parents.

Therefore, the IFP would like to see more money  and  supervision  given  to
such families to enable children to have sufficient food  and  clothes  and,
at the same time, to be able to continue with their education.

Kuye  kusiphathe  kabi   ukuzwa   ukuthi   kukhona   imali   ebuyela   emuva

Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[We get very upset whenever we learn that there  is  some  money  which  has
remained unspent. In the 2001-2002 budget R78 million  was  not  used.  This
really upsets us, because there are orphans who go to bed  hungry.  In  some
households parents have died of HIV/Aids. In  others  they  are  sickly  and
have become unemployed due to this disease and as a result families starve.

The public can benefit from these millions and millions of  rands  that  are
sent back. How would it be  if  social  welfare  and  community  development
built centres to take care of the destitute and collect from those who  have
means, so that school-going children can receive nutritious  food,  so  that
no family or individual goes to  sleep  without  a  meal?  Orphans  must  be
protected and supported so  that  they  can  pursue  their  education  where
necessary. The elderly who keep orphans should not spend all their money  on
providing for them. The department needs to increase its  financial  support
so that no funds are returned while people need help  and  are  not  getting
it.

Funds targeted for poverty alleviation should not be made available to  only
a special group or individuals, but must be equally accessible to those  who
need help to secure seeds and implements.  People  who  need  money  to  buy
materials to produce what they are skilled in and make a  living  with  must
be assisted. If this unspent money had been used for  such  things,  no  one
would complain about it. Assistance should be as easily available as the  T-
shirts we wear in campaigning for elections.

The IFP applauds the contribution by the Minister and his department.]

Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs, special  delegates  and  hon
members, in supporting the Budget  Vote  I  would  like  to  be  allowed  to
identify myself with and  to  give  my  full  support  to  the  aim  of  the
department, which is to contribute towards improving the quality of life  of
the poor, the vulnerable and the marginalised.
Poverty  is  still  prevalent  in  most  communities  in  our  country.  Its
eradication is therefore among the key objectives of this department.  Allow
me to also highlight some facts that  make  quite  interesting  and  serious
reading about poverty in my own province.

The Eastern Cape is considered to be the poorest province based  on  monthly
household expenditure. The poorest district councils - Alfred Nzo  and  O  R
Tambo - are also in the Eastern Cape, and the poorest magisterial  districts
of Elliotdale and Willowvale, are, again, in the  Eastern  Cape.  The  above
information is based on the 1995 income and expenditure survey, merged  with
data from the 1995 annual October household survey, and then  compared  with
equivalent data from the 1996 census.

The  Eastern  Cape  is  the  province  most  in  need   of   infrastructural
development such as clean water and sanitation.  It  is  also  the  province
most in need of  improvement  in  life  circumstances,  such  as  employment
creation and family planning. The hon Minister's dedication and  passion  to
tackling poverty head-on is highly appreciated by the people of the  Eastern
Cape. However, the UDM is fully aware that his department alone  cannot  win
the battle. It is an effort that requires that  other  departments  and  the
people of the Eastern Cape join hands with the Minister.

Estimates of the proportion of South  Africans  living  in  poverty  differ.
Statistics SA recorded 29% of people living in poverty in 1996,  much  lower
than the estimate of 52% as reflected in the 1996 census.  Poverty  is  most
widespread in rural areas and more prevalent in households headed  by  women
in the largely rural provinces of the Eastern Cape and the Free  State.  The
increasing rate of unemployment has been  a  major  factor  contributing  to
high levels of poverty and inequality. Available information  reflects  that
unemployment rose from 17% in 1995 to 23% in  1999,  and  to  27%  in  2000.
Twenty-six per cent of poor households  are  dependent  on  state  transfers
such as old age pensions. Such are the challenges facing us as a  nation  in
eradicating poverty and inequality.

Programmes launched by the department in the past seven years  are  designed
to provide people with access to certain assets and capabilities  needed  to
overcome poverty. Progress has been  made  in  increasing  access  to  basic
needs and in reducing deprivation, but forbidding challenges  still  remain.
More insight in this regard has been  gained  from  the  recently  published
draft report of the Committee of Inquiry  into  a  Comprehensive  System  of
Social Security for South Africa.  According  to  the  report,  the  poorest
communities are still living  in  conditions  that  compromise  their  human
dignity.

Barriers to accessing basic facilities by  the  poor  remain  administrative
and institutional. Lack of capacity or capacity to spend  have  always  been
reasons given to explain the problem.  Some  individuals  living  in  abject
poverty have difficulty in accessing  health  care  and  primary  education,
because they lack  the  basic  income  for  transport,  food  and  clothing.
Although  the  Government  programmes  to  fight  poverty   are   critically
important for sustainable  human  development  and  economic  growth,  their
efficiency for now, and especially  regarding  the  poorest  people  in  the
rural areas,  is,  however,  compromised  by  the  unsustainable  levels  of
poverty.

Another important finding by the committee relates to the current  range  of
poverty relief programmes being unable to make  any  significant  impact  on
mass-based unemployment and levels of income poverty. Many of  the  projects
are also not cost-efficient in terms of their outcomes. Many programmes  for
alleviating poverty are not targeted  effectively  in  rural  areas  and  at
beneficiaries. Rural women and disabled  people,  to  give  examples,  still
find it difficult to gain access to land in  order  to  benefit  from  these
programmes.

Having said all this, what is most appreciated is  that  the  Department  of
Social Development is seen to  be  taking  care  of  these  challenges  that
obstruct all endeavours to fight poverty. The report  of  the  committee  of
inquiry, already referred  to  earlier,  is  a  clear  indication  that  the
department seeks every available and  the  most  effective  and  sustainable
options  to  succeed  in  the  war  against  poverty.  It  was   indeed   an
exceptionally good idea to create an opportunity through  the  committee  to
engage people  themselves,  even  the  poorest,  to  represent  and  express
themselves about how poverty ravages their lives. The content of the  report
is, however, a subject for another debate. For now,  the  UDM  supports  the
Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Ms M A MOTSHEKGA (Gauteng): Chairperson, Minister, MECs present, members  of
the NCOP,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  on  16  June  1995  South  Africa's  old
democratic government ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the  Child
and, in so doing, committed South Africa to implementing the  principles  of
first call for children, in  terms  of  which  the  needs  of  children  are
considered paramount in all government programmes, services and  development
strategies. Therefore, the Gauteng programme of action is  guided  by  these
principles, the lead department in Gauteng being the  department  of  social
development.

The vision of the programme is to create a society  in  which  children  are
protected and developed to  their  full  potential,  the  mission  being  to
operationalise the  principle  of  ``children  first''  in  all  policy  and
programme development in the Gauteng province. The  guiding  principles  are
``Children first''; promoting co-ordination  of  activities,  especially  at
the local and community levels; promoting complementary policy  development;
ensuring effective intersectoral collaboration and partnerships  to  support
the planning, implementation and monitoring  of  the  children's  programme;
and to develop  mechanisms  which  will  maximise  all  efforts  to  provide
quality services to children. The other aim  is  to  ensure  that  we  avoid
duplication and competition amongst departments and  organisations  involved
in the children's programme.

Gauteng is the smallest province in the country, occupying only  1%  of  the
total area of the country, but is the most densely populated area  with  18%
of South Africa's population. It has the highest percentage  of  growth  and
it also has the highest percentages of international  and  local  migration.
It has its own a typical age structure, a small number of young  people  and
an above average proportion of people of working age. Gauteng  is  the  only
province which has more men  than  women,  and  the  highest  percentage  of
people moving in and out of the province.

In Gauteng statistics are collected and emphasis is  placed  on  econometric
data, with that data reflecting averages for magisterial districts  and  not
specific areas and groupings within those areas. This obscures  the  reality
of poverty in the province, especially the poverty affecting  children.  But
Gauteng, being the most  densely  populated  area  in  our  country,  has  a
correspondingly  high  number  of  people,  including  children,  living  in
poverty. It has a high number of children who come from outside the  country
and of unaccompanied children coming over our  borders  requiring  help  and
assistance from Government.

Owing to its unique character, Gauteng also attracts the  problem  of  child
labour as children are recruited from different parts  of  the  country  and
brought to  Gauteng  as  child  labour.  We  have  started  a  programme  in
collaboration with other sister departments, the  SAPS  and  the  department
relating to safety and liaison, to make sure that  we  track  down  children
who  have  been  recruited  and  brought  to  Gauteng  as  child  labour.  A
partnership does exist between  the  SAPS  and  the  provincial  safety  and
liaison department in Gauteng to combat commercial  sexual  exploitation  of
children, which is also one of  the  manifestations  brought  about  by  the
poverty the children find themselves in.

The  recent  raids  on  hotels  harbouring  children   involved   in   child
prostitution has been a collaborative effort. Underage children are  removed
from identified brothels and placed in places of safety. Special  programmes
and training are being provided to help child care workers  deal  with  this
new phenomenon, and we have different rehabilitation projects  that  we  are
putting in place to protect our children.

As I have  mentioned,  Gauteng  also  has  the  unique  problem  of  refugee
children. The provision of services to  refugee  children  continues  to  be
problematic in Gauteng. The department of  social  services  and  population
development is responsible for placing children under temporary care in  the
places of safety.  Unfortunately,  these  children  are  not  registered  or
awarded refugee  status.  They  are  not  entitled  to  apply  for  identity
documents at the Department of Home Affairs.  As  a  result,  they  are  not
allowed to apply for social security in terms of the Social Assistance  Act.
Furthermore, access to schooling which is incumbent  on  identity  documents
or permanent residence certificates is thus denied to these children.

With regard to another programme we have  in  Gauteng,  we  are  putting  in
place  special  measures  to  protect  children  with  special  needs.  This
includes children living in difficult situations,  such  as  those  who  are
working and living on the streets, children living in poverty, children  who
are orphaned, children who are  challenged,  victims  of  violence,  refugee
children or unaccompanied minors, and those affected and infected  by  Aids.
In  Gauteng  this  has  been  one  of  the  areas  that  required  the  most
integration  and  intersectoral  work,  and  I  think  it  is  taking  place
successfully.
There are 6 193 children in foster care and, as a  result  of  the  HIV/Aids
pandemic, it is projected that these numbers will increase  dramatically  in
the coming years. We have 52 registered children's homes  which  accommodate
about 4 000 children. The  department  of  social  services  and  population
development in Gauteng manages about seven places of safety, five  detention
centres and one secure care centre in Gauteng. Owing to the increase in  the
number of reported abuse, neglect and HIV cases, the  demand  for  placement
is rising. This has necessitated the building of an additional  secure  care
facility for children at the Van Ryn place of safety.

We are still awaiting the finalisation of the regulations in respect of  the
Gauteng Street Children Shelters Act  of  1988.  Various  street  children's
shelters are being registered and accommodate about 1  200  children.  There
are currently 36 shelters, of which eight are registered, and in total  they
can accommodate, as I have said, about 1 200 children.

I would like to focus more on the question of  poverty  as  it  affects  our
children, an issue which is led by our able Minister. We  have  also,  as  a
province, relooked at and re-examined  our  strategies  to  make  sure  that
children are protected, with more emphasis  on  protecting  children  living
with Aids. We are vigilant about  this  in  that  as  the  scourge  of  Aids
continues to ravage our communities, the needs and plight  of  the  children
continue  to  be  our  first  call.  With   the   Minister's   support   and
encouragement,  we  are  continually  relooking  at  and  re-examining   our
services to ensure that children are protected and our future is  protected.


Amongst other things, we are dedicating a special line in  our  call  centre
to get communities  and  families  to  alert  us  to  children  who  are  in
difficult situations, who are not receiving state assistance or who  require
state assistance.

We are also convening bimonthly meetings with members of mayoral  committees
in local government who are charged with welfare and social  development  in
order to help collaborate and support each other's work on issues  affecting
children, especially children living in difficult situations.

The department of social  services  is  responsible  for  paying  grants  to
beneficiaries in order  to  to  alleviate  poverty  amongst  underprivileged
children. At present in Gauteng we are paying for the foster care  of  about
6 193 beneficiaries; for the care dependency of  2  891  beneficiaries;  and
more than 120 000 child support grants. In line with the  Minister  and  the
President's call, we are also working very hard to extend the  child  safety
net. We have put in place a massive programme  to  identify  those  children
who have no access to or who do not  access  our  grants.  In  collaboration
with the Department of Health and the Department of  Home  Affairs,  we  are
helping those children acquire the necessary documentation in  order  to  be
able to process the grants.

In the process of reorientating our poverty  alleviation  strategy,  we  are
also intending to change our targeting strategy to make sure that we  target
the vulnerable people through  the  children.  We  are  doing  this  through
working closely with schools and clinics so that the  families  of  children
who perhaps go to school malnourished can be tracked down and those are  the
families  which  are  being  targeted  for  our  new   poverty   alleviation
programme.

Under the able leadership of our Minister, we are committed and we  want  to
ensure that at all costs as a province we do  not  fail  our  children  and,
also, that we do  not  fail  our  country  and  its  future,  which  is  its
children. [Applause.]

Mr P M BASOPU (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, allow me  to  tender  an  apology
for our MEC,  Comrade  Kondlo,  who  could  not  make  today's  debate.  The
department of social development in our province,  particularly  this  year,
put more emphasis on development, as the central feature  of  operation,  in
its various programmes. Although there are  various  programmes  within  our
department we will, for the purposes of this debate, be  brief  and  confine
our presentation to  three  identified  programmes,  namely  the  integrated
HIV/Aids plan, poverty eradication and the child poverty programme.

The department has since been engaged in the national  integrated  plan  for
children  and  youth  infected  and  affected  by  HIV/Aids.  This  strategy
includes community home-based care, voluntary testing  and  counselling  and
has life-skills components. The department has piloted  the  above  strategy
in Tsolo and Butterworth. Through good lessons learnt from these  sites,  it
was deemed fit to replicate  the  process  at  three  more  sites,  that  is
Bathurst, Mdantsane and Motherwell, in this current financial year.

An  amount  of  R4,6  million  will  be  allocated  to  the  province  as  a
conditional grant to run these programmes. We  will  implement  new  poverty
alleviation programmes, targeting  infected  and  affected  families  in  an
attempt to break the vicious cycle of poverty and HIV/Aids.

The policy speech for this year clearly outlined that the  department  would
expand and strengthen both educational programmes, and the care and  support
of families and communities affected and infected by this disease.

In line with the theme  of  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty,  the
department will be engaged in the following activities. Firstly,  the  focus
this year is on reaching more than one  million  children  in  distress  and
arranging suitable placements for  them,  that  is  the  orphans,  and  also
assisting with social relief for needy  families.  Secondly,  an  amount  of
R1,5 million has been set aside to assist  approximately  850  000  families
with food parcels in order to curb the plight of poverty, especially in  the
Alfred Nzo district municipality, which has a  high  poverty  rate.  In  our
province affected households are found with literally  nothing  to  eat  for
the day.

The areas that have been targeted for assistance, that is for social  relief
are:  Tsolo,  where  250  families  are  being  targeted  over  12   months,
Elliotdale, Butterworth, Mdantsane,  Bathurst,  Mzimkhulu,  and  Lusikisiki.
One hundred families in each area will be targeted over 12 months, while  in
Motherwell 50 families will be targeted over 12 months.

In fast-tracking the community home-based  care  programme,  the  department
has planned  to  establish  these  programmes  in  six  districts  with  the
assistance of volunteers. An amount of  R533  000  has  been  set  aside  to
assist with the payment of a volunteer incentive of R300 per  volunteer  per
month. This will also be  strengthened  by  having  training  workshops  for
volunteers  and  there  will  be  community  mobilisation  to   make   these
programmes more visible and sustainable.

The department has also planned  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  NGOs  as
partners by setting aside an amount of R1 million,  which  will  go  towards
community initiatives rendering services to  children,  youth  and  families
infected and affected by HIV, targeting 20 NGOs to be reached this year.

The department has forged a partnership with Unicef this year  with  a  view
to assisting in conducting research in the form of a situation  analysis  of
vulnerable children and an evaluation of services rendered to  children  and
youth infected and affected by HIV/Aids. This will assist the department  in
developing more  informed  plans  and  effective  strategies  that  seek  to
address identified needs and rights of children.

There are challenges.  To  make  these  interventions  a  reality,  we  have
subjected the HIV/Aids unit to institutional  realignment  by  upgrading  it
into  a  subdirectorate  of  a  newly  established   community   development
directorate, with dedicated district and service  office  co-ordinators,  as
an attempt to address human resource challenges.

The department is experiencing huge  budgetary  constraints  as  it  depends
mostly on the conditional grant  to  implement  effective  service  delivery
across the province. An amount of R1,6 million has been budgeted for in  the
province to deliver this service, but this has not been allocated yet.  This
will have  a  negative  impact  on  the  improvement  of  service  delivery,
especially where families live below the average standard of living.

With regard to poverty relief, the department has funded 26  poverty  relief
programmes in the past financial year, and six programmes in this  financial
year over a period of two years.  According to  the  programmatic  approach,
these programmes have made a major impact,  which assisted in  changing  the
lives of ordinary Eastern Cape citizens, with a particular  focus  on  rural
women, for example the Mbalisweni women at  Lebode,  as  have  many  similar
programmes.

Currently, we are in the second year  of  funding  these  programmes,  which
will be implemented according to the following  objectives.  Firstly,  there
will be nine food security  programmes,  10  HIV/Aids  programmes,  1  youth
programme, 20 rural women's programmes and  20  children's  programmes.  Our
focus for this year will be on  social  facilitation  programme  design  and
training of programme participants as prerequisites for sustainability,  and
our focus will also be on food production and marketing.

The department is in the process of establishing  an  additional  nine  food
security programmes, the only  ones  that  will  be  added  to  this  phase.
However, three top-sliced food programmes will be considered, implying  that
six programmes will be established in each of the following  six  districts,
which are Ukhahlamba, Chris Hani, Cacadu, Amathole, O  R  Tambo  and  Alfred
Nzo,  in  this  current  financial  year.  The  provincial  department,   in
consultation  with  the  national  department,  appointed   two   consultant
organisations, that is Acete and Khula Development Facilitators  to  support
the development of  offices  to  strengthen  the  poverty  relief  projects.
Another objective of the teams  is  to  render  the  necessary  guidance  to
projects, ensuring that programmes utilise  funds  in  accordance  with  the
PFMA principles in order to achieve  sustainability.  We  are  managing  the
support process to ensure that its objectives are  met.  Strict  monitoring,
both at district level and provincial level, is maintained.
Regarding  child  poverty  the  department  of  social  development  in  the
province deals with child poverty directly and indirectly, because  this  is
a crosscutting function. Our entry point as the department in  the  province
will speed up the provision of access to all social grants, with  particular
emphasis on the child support grant, in collaboration with  the  health  and
home affairs departments.

Given the heavy dependence on the grants in the province, the  socioeconomic
impact of such access will be enormous, thereby improving quality  of  life.
The province will be working on all grants for the rest  of  the  three-year
period, but special attention will be focused on  the  child  support  grant
and the  disability  grant.  At  the  end  of  the  programme,  systems  and
infrastructure will be entrenched and capable  of  managing  future  ongoing
registration requirements.

The target for child support grant registration in the Eastern Cape  is  648
053 for this year. To date, 277 939 children have  been  registered.  It  is
intended that an additional 370  114  will  register  this  financial  year.
Also, our HIV programmes mentioned  above  benefit  children  as  well.  For
example, we direct orphans to foster care grants. We also  deal  with  child
poverty through the provision of food parcels  to  needy  families  infected
with and affected by HIV/Aids in various parts of the province.

In conclusion, the department of social development in our province  is  one
of those  critical  departments  that  is  committed  to  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty. The above-mentioned programmes are just three  amongst
other services that deal with  poverty  within  the  province.  Despite  the
above, we have suffered massive underallocation  at  an  operational  level,
which will negatively affect our ability to deliver. We therefore call  upon
this National Council of Provinces to assist our department in this  regard.
[Applause.]

Ms  E  M  COLEMAN  (Mpumalanga):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  Dr  Skweyiya,
colleagues from  other  provinces,  hon  members,  one  of  the  fundamental
objectives of our department is to assist Government in the  eradication  of
poverty through all possible means and ways.

As the department of social services,  population  and  development  in  the
Mpumalanga, we acknowledge and recognise the fact that poverty is the  enemy
of development of the people of South Africa.

In terms of statistics, Mpumalanga is rated the fifth  poorest  province  in
the country, with a record 57% poverty rate. In line  with  the  President's
opening address in Parliament this year, namely pushing back  the  frontiers
of  poverty,  the  department  acknowledges  the  fact   that   considerable
improvements have been made  in  the  poverty  profile  of  certain  of  our
communities, most of those being in  what  is  called  ``poverty  pockets.''
Though such improvements are being considered in  most  of  the  areas,  the
face and status of poverty in our province remains a big challenge.

The department has compiled a document on the  demographics  of  poverty  in
the province. From this document, the face of our people  and  that  of  the
province is quite clear. Poverty is something that many of  our  people  are
experiencing and the scars are  glaring.  It  is  unthinkable  how  humanity
survives the scourge of poverty when  it  has  struck.  This  is  mostly  so
because poverty is multidimensional and not easily defined.

In an effort to alleviate poverty, we have  explored  alternative  responses
and models. We have begun to focus on programmes  instead  of  projects.  We
seem to be making bigger strides in this regard. In the  year  2000-01,  the
total of 46 programmes initiated received support  in  the  amount  of  R9,7
million and almost 1 134 people benefited.

I am  pleased  to  report  that  the  model  has  yielded  and  resulted  in
sustainable outcomes. As I report here today, out of  the  46  projects,  19
are successful and consistently provide financial benefits  of  up  to  R700
per beneficiary on a monthly basis.
These  projects  are  clustered  into  nine  programmes,   comprising   food
security, HIV/Aids, manufacturing, arts  and  crafts,  etc.  A  programmatic
approach was adopted, as opposed to funding isolated, incoherent projects.

Currently, a total of 56 initiatives are being supported  through  a  three-
year funding period that  commenced  in  2001-02  to  2003-04.  In  monetary
terms, the department has committed R4,3 million  for  the  first  year  and
R10,4 million for the second year, while for the last year, 2004, an  amount
of R6,8 million has been committed.

We are mindful that poverty affects mostly women and children. In trying  to
address this, we have funded  initiatives  with  the  primary  target  group
being  women  who  constitute  90%,  with  youth  constituting  5%  and  men
constituting 5%. As a prerequisite for funding, we have made  the  condition
that there must be a  2%  representation  of  people  with  disabilities  in
poverty relief initiatives.

In an attempt to sustain the poverty alleviation programmes,  the  following
strategies were adopted in addition to the ones I have just  mentioned.  The
province has set aside its own provincial reserve for  poverty  alleviation.
The purpose is to support initiatives  that  fall  outside  the  conditional
grant. Nine entities received financial support last year to the  amount  of
R655 000. For the current financial year, a total of R3,1 million  was  made
available for the funding of 25 initiatives and  for  the  strengthening  of
existing entities that have potential.

The province has embarked  on  a  massive  public  education  and  awareness
campaign geared towards positioning of communities for  development  through
access  to  resources  and  information.  A  total  of  634   projects   are
prioritised for the year 2002-03. As part of  investment  in  human  capital
for sustainable  development,  the  Department  of  Labour  is  implementing
capacity enhancement programmes for all projects.

The department has transformed its poverty  alleviation  programmes  into  a
community development section that embraces broader developmental  mandates.
These are some of the issues from which we want to  enhance  the  foundation
laid by the President and the Minister in  addressing  hunger,  poverty  and
unemployment in our society.

We also acknowledge that  the  children  are  the  future  leaders  of  this
country for sustainable development and as such they are a priority  in  all
our programmes. We are, in that regard,  currently  funding  107  000  child
support grant beneficiaries, benefiting 134 172 children. We  have  embarked
on an aggressive marketing strategy on the child support grant in  order  to
reach out to every member of society, including those in farm areas.

While we accept the Government responsibility of assisting children and  our
people living in poverty, we wish to condemn certain  unbecoming  tendencies
of people who abuse initiatives or the generosity  of  Government.  I  speak
here of people who abuse the system and  benefit  unlawfully  from  some  of
these schemes. We were forced to come to the same realisation on  corruption
and fraud and, as a department, to come up with strategies to assist in  the
restoration of the dignity and the intention or purpose  of  the  grant.  We
were forced, in our concern, to engage  communities,  educating  them  about
the benefits of using the system correctly - using the  grant  correctly  to
benefit those who qualify.

We  introduced,  as  a  department,  a  fraud  prevention  strategy   called
Operation  Buyisa.  Operation  Buyisa  simply  means  ``bring  back''.  This
operation, to a large extent, has managed  to  detect  fraudulent  practices
prior to the commencement of the project. From the investigations  conducted
in terms of this operation in the Ehlanzeni region where we had a  total  of
34  637  beneficiaries,  7  252  beneficiaries  could  not   turn   up   for
reregistration and 275  of  those  who  turned  up  were  discovered  to  be
fraudulently involved.

We have a crisis which requires the involvement of common  society  to  help
the natives of our country out of a scourge which  continues  to  erode  the
masses of our people, in particular the  youth.  The  HIV/Aids  pandemic  is
real. The speed at which it is spreading does not only  threaten  life,  but
will threaten the economy of  our  country  in  years  to  come.  A  country
without youth will have a limited think-tank, and  its  future  leaders  and
future will be limited. Based on this realisation,  we  continue  to  direct
resources to community-based initiatives for the care and support of  people
affected by and infected with this pandemic. We do so hoping that one day  a
solution to this crisis will be found. The statistics on orphans  identified
in terms of the Masoyi home-based care project  and  other  home-based  care
projects definitely call for  a  response  from  the  department  and  other
stakeholders in our society.

Operation Nakekela, a process that was implemented to  identify  orphans  in
the communities who need support and care, has been  implemented.  Two  such
initiatives  under  Operation  Nakekela   involving   social   workers   and
volunteers were undertaken from 6 to 17 November 2000  and  from  12  to  23
March 2001,  in  which  1  698  children  in  the  Ehlanzeni  district  were
identified. Of this total, 263 have been placed in foster care  through  our
courts. Twenty-one home-based and community-based projects were  established
and registered with the  department  in  the  previous  financial  year.  An
amount  of  R1,5  million  has  been  spent  to  fund  this  operation  -  a
conditional grant from the national Government. We  want  to  continue  with
this operation to help address the problems around HIV/Aids and  all  issues
affecting our children in general.

The major intentions are to develop capacity  from  the  current  home-based
care projects, to establish new projects  and  to  strengthen  the  existing
ones. This will be our contribution, our engagement,  in  trying  to  assist
those who need our support most. The department will continue,  through  the
help of the national Government, to look at ways and means of bettering  the
lives of our people. [Applause.]

Mr R MASHABA (Northern Province):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  colleagues,
hon members of the National Council of Provinces,  whereas  serious  strides
have been made in the past  seven  years  of  our  democratic  dispensation,
there can be no doubt that the myriad of challenges that we face  from  time
to time has the  potential  to  compromise  Government  efforts  to  improve
services. We will, however, remain determined to  overcome  these  problems,
especially because we count on the solid relationships that  we  have  built
with various stakeholders in the province.

With regard to poverty relief and children's rights, paramount  amongst  the
headway we have made and seek to consolidate  is  the  measure  of  progress
that we are registering in the area of  poverty  relief.  In  spite  of  the
problems associated with the lack  of  facilities,  water,  electricity  and
marketing opportunities as well as skills, we remain convinced that  we  are
succeeding considerably in making the necessary impact.

We remain aware that the sustainability of  these  efforts  depends  on  the
extent to which they are constantly monitored and supported  so  that  their
capacity can be strengthened further  and  expanded.  This  has  required  a
review  of  our  capacity-building  efforts  and  a  need  to  engender   an
integrated and sustainable approach to poverty relief.

Accordingly,  the  department  is  involved  in  various   capacity-building
programmes  for  both  project  members  and  staff,  with   links   already
established with such institutions as Medunsa, the  University  of  Pretoria
and the University of Cape Town.

To further  ensure  sustainability  and  to  achieve  the  objective  of  an
integrated approach, several initiatives  are  being  launched  in  all  the
districts to link poverty  relief  projects  with  health  institutions  and
primary school nutrition programmes.  This  initiative  is  already  bearing
fruit as some of our hospitals are already purchasing items like bread  from
the community projects.

Furthermore, these projects are being linked to the HIV/Aids community home-
based care programmes so that items  such  as  food  parcels,  clothing  and
blankets can be purchased directly from  these  projects  for  provision  to
families and individuals affected by  and  infected  with  HIV/Aids.  During
this financial year and beyond, we will also be ensuring that an  additional
allocation is made for projects to adopt child-headed homes.

Our commitment to  do  more  than  complain  about  the  problems  of  child
poverty, child abuse and neglect stems from the amount of determination  and
support that is beginning to flow from  various  sectors  in  our  province.
From our recent interaction with the SA Council of Churches, Sangoco in  the
province,  the  Youth  Commission,  organised   business   and   traditional
authorities, it is becoming clear that the majority of our people are  ready
to lend a hand in putting children first.

Linked to all these programmes is the imperative to reach  out  to  all  the
needy children who qualify for  child  support  grants  and  all  the  other
relevant  grants.  We  in  the  Limpopo  province  clearly  understand   the
challenge and are therefore  determined  to  access  even  the  remotest  of
areas. We will endeavour to mobilise the youth, the students  and  community
structures in general  to  realise  this  objective.  We  cannot  afford  to
disappoint the needy children.

Regarding social security, hon members will recall that in our  past  policy
speeches we have always been hammering on  about  the  issue  of  inadequate
budgets to meet the pressures that we are facing in the province.  We  would
like to take this opportunity to appreciate the fact that our insistence  on
this issue has led to the additional allocation of R235 million at  the  end
of the 2001-02 financial year. This has enabled us to pay an  extra  17  697
old age grants, 11 457 disability grants, 2 061 foster care  grants,  1  589
grants for care givers and 62 882 child support grants.

With reference to HIV/Aids, we are embarking on  all  these  initiatives  in
the midst of the threat posed by the scourge of HIV/Aids, which, of  course,
is continuing to have a devastating impact on the population that we  serve,
as well as on our resources in general. As the major focus  of  the  welfare
branch of our department, we have rigorous  programmes  on  community  home-
based care, counselling, support and care for orphans, as well  as  outreach
programmes for young people.

We are  strengthening  our  integrated  messages  and  focus  on  issues  of
prevention, treatment, care and support, as well as on the human rights  and
legal rights of the affected  and  infected.  We  are  supporting  about  13
community  home-based  care  sites  in  the  province,  which  we   envisage
increasing to 30 by the end of the 2003 financial year.

Our gratitude goes to stakeholders such as Unicef  and  the  Nelson  Mandela
Children's Fund for the role they are playing in  the  community  home-based
care programmes in the province. Similarly, we have thus far  been  able  to
reach out to 1 369 families and to 1 649 orphans, including 42  child-headed
families, all of whom are supplied with counselling services, food  parcels,
clothing, blankets and burial expenses. To meet  all  these  challenges,  we
have increased the  overall  HIV/Aids  budget  from  R2,9  million  to  R6,4
million.

Coming to social services, as we double our efforts  to  realise  all  these
objectives, we also recognise the fact that our  country  and  our  province
are reeling under a dark cloud that is tearing our moral fabric  apart.  Our
province is also affected by incidents of  child  abuse  and  abuse  of  the
elderly, rape and other forms of domestic violence.

In many instances our department  finds  itself  having  to  deal  with  the
consequences of these gruesome incidents. As a result, we have  developed  a
range of programmes on matters of care for the  elderly,  children  and  the
youth; on substance  abuse;  and  on  victim  empowerment.  We  will  strive
vigorously  to  implement  these  programmes  with  the  full   support   of
Government's commitment to the moral regeneration of our society.

In conclusion, we do acknowledge  the  fact  that  we  are  still  far  from
meeting the challenges that exist  in  the  province,  and  that  they  will
require a great deal of resources  for  us  to  satisfy  our  constitutional
mandate. We, however, appreciate the reality of the  forward  movement  that
we are witnessing in terms of the improvement  of  our  budget  allocations.
The additional allocation  of  R235  million  at  the  end  of  the  2001-02
financial year has, for instance, assisted a great deal  in  addressing  our
social security backlogs.

Social security forms the major part of the budget, constituting 94% of  the
total allocation. Within  the  budget,  R20  million  will  go  towards  the
construction and upgrading of paypoints to ensure accessibility  and  better
services, and R7  million  will  go  towards  the  maintenance  of  district
offices and institutions.

As a province, we would like to support this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon  MECs,  special  delegates
present here and hon members of the National Council of  Provinces,  at  the
request of my colleague Nono I am happy to announce that Brazil has made  it
to the semifinals of the World Cup by beating England 2-1. [Applause.]
The task of eradicating poverty, a goal for which the department stands,  is
a huge one. Poverty, which I refer to here as a monster, is deep-rooted  and
widely spread among our  people,  and  the  rural  dwellers  are  the  worst
affected. It is estimated that 40% of all South  Africans  live  in  poverty
and hunger. When one takes into  account  the  rising  costs  of  basic  and
staple foods, one begins to see how difficult it is for our people  to  make
ends meet.

We are agreed that the Government of the day may not fold its  arms  and  do
nothing. We are agreed that it must  rise  to  the  occasion  and  grab  the
monster by the horns. We cannot afford to see our  people  being  devastated
by poverty and hunger. So, the receiving a grant to alleviate this  distress
is not a privilege, but imperative.

We are agreed that relief and alleviation of distress can be  brought  about
when this monster is attacked on all fronts simultaneously. This means  that
at the same time as social development pays its social grants, housing  must
provide  low-cost  housing,  health  must  provide  the  necessary   medical
supplies and education must also play its part.

In that way, that is by providing  an  integrated  implementation  strategy,
the beneficiary will find some relief from his or her  stressful  condition.
So we want to applaud and congratulate the hon Minister  on  the  allocation
of funds for this purpose.

Another  threatening  monster  in  the  lives  of  our  communities  is  the
prevalence of HIV/Aids. This  monster  has  been  the  subject  of  hot  and
acrimonious debate in the news media. We are in support  of  the  allocation
of funds for this issue  and  we  also  support  the  preventative  measures
outlined, including the use of condoms. However, we are concerned about  the
disposal of used condoms. How exactly must the used condoms be  disposed  of
so that they do not land up in the hands of innocent children?  How  exactly
must they be disposed of so that they do not block drains  and  pile  up  at
sewerage purification plants? This is our country's problem. And  I  am  not
exonerating my party from this problem, but sounding a call timeously.

However, we are in support of the allocation of funds for this  purpose.  It
is also noted with appreciation that the home-based care and the  community-
based care programmes would also receive their slice of the  cake.  This  is
very important for homes in which there is absolutely nothing.

In conclusion, I wish to applaud the hon Minister for his dedication in  the
midst of a stressful situation, and indicate that  we  support  this  Budget
Vote. [Applause.]

Mrs M A KHUNWANA (North West):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  NCOP  members,
members of the legislatures from the provinces, MECs here  present  here,  I
greet you all. I am honoured to stand here and discuss the budget speech  of
the hon Minister of Social Development.

South Africa is still swimming in poverty. I wish that all of us  here,  all
parties included, would join hands and give our people relief from  poverty.


Poverty is a wall which we  need  to  push  away.  When  we  campaigned  for
elections, all parties, including my party, promised  our  people  a  better
life. So, we must continue to pursue this goal. It is  high  time  that  the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and the  Department  of
Social  Development  join  hands  to  assist  our  people,  especially   our
children. Maintenance is a thorn in the flesh.  The  standing  committee  on
social welfare from the North West, together  with  the  social  development
portfolio committee from the national  Parliament,  undertook  an  oversight
visit to various magistrates' courts.  To  our  amazement  we  learnt  that,
indeed, the outcry of our people out there was genuine.

Women who receive their pensions  through  magistrates'  courts  are  ripped
off. The people who defraud these women do not think  about  the  fact  that
they are not only defrauding these women, but also  our  children,  and  our
children are our future. Without our children,  our  future  is  doomed.  As
they rob these children of the moneys given to them by their  fathers,  they
force them onto the street to look for food. As a result they  do  not  even
go to school.

We found in the magistrates' courts in places  such  as  Tlhabane,  Mogwase,
etc, that money was bundled together according to currency, lying around  in
the safes, with expired cheques and postal orders.  Anybody  had  access  to
the keys of the safes. How much  money  survives  theft?  Of  the  officials
working there, 80%  are  volunteers,  volunteers  who  do  not  receive  any
incentives, neither do they receive fares or lunch. They are expected to  be
on duty five days a week from eight to four, and all  that  loose  money  is
lying around! What can one then expect?

I request the Minister to do something to assist these children, as this  is
not a provincial competency. When we asked why the money  was  lying  around
and safe keys were not kept in safety, they said they could  not  get  round
to checking the money or keeping the keys to themselves  because  they  were
short-staffed.

I congratulate the Minister on increasing the amount of the social  pension.
Indeed, the ANC-led Government has its people at  heart,  one  can  imagine,
because the social pension has been increased from a mere  R350  to  R620  a
month. Indeed,  this  was  a  great  relief  for  our  pensioners  who  are,
unfortunately, breadwinners. The Minister once said that no  pensioner  must
leave a paypoint without being paid out, but, unfortunately, this  is  still
happening.

With regard to the giving of child support grants to  black  children,  this
is historic, because the previous government left  black  children  to  fend
for  themselves   without   any   assistance   from   government   at   all.
Unfortunately, this money is now misused by the parents of  these  children.
It is with regret that most of the parents who receive these moneys  have  a
tendency of misusing it by having their  hair  done  and  drinking  alcohol,
instead of buying food  and  clothes  for  their  children.  We,  therefore,
recommend that the child support grant be given out in vouchers  for  either
food or clothes so that it is used for its intended purpose.

Regarding poverty alleviation funds,  the  Government  has  taken  extensive
responsibility for providing these funds, but unfortunately, instead of  the
departments using them, they keep them in order to report them as  a  saving
at the end of the financial year. How can anyone save at the expense of  the
poor? We know that the hon Minister is concerned about poverty  alleviation,
but he is being let down by  his  colleagues.  I  wish  the  Minister  could
instill the same feeling in his colleagues.

We recommend that food parcels be given to the poor, that more  projects  be
introduced and monitored intensively so as to alleviate  poverty,  and  that
the department works together with other  departments  such  as  Health  and
Agriculture in order to be successful.  I  demand  that  the  MPs  and  MPLs
assist in this respect. I appreciate the efforts the Minister is making.  He
really needs our support, that is the support of the MPLs and MPs  from  all
parties, to see to the implementation of sustainable projects  in  order  to
relieve poverty.

The Ministers of Social Development and Health should join hands to  improve
school feeding schemes. These funds  are  not  adequate.  Only  children  in
Grades 1 and 2 have access to this food. In the meantime, some children,  up
to Grade 12, go to school hungry and this  diminishes  their  concentration.
Let us all protect our children. We  must  remember  the  slogan  ``Children
First''.

Having said  this,  I  request  all  parties  to  accept  this  Budget  Vote
unconditionally. [Applause.]

Nk M XULU (KwaZulu-Natal): Sihlalo ohloniphekile,  ngibingelela  umhlonishwa
uDokotela Sikweyiya nabahlonishwa bonke abakhona eNdlini.

Uma umuntu ebuka lesi sabelo usibuka kube  sengathi  sikhulu  kakhulu  kanti
ngendlela esinezinselelo ngayo, sibukeka  sisincane.  Abantu  ababelwa  sona
baningi ngendlela eyisimangaliso. Kanti futhi kuthi kunjalo nje  kube  khona
nalezi zigebengu eziyidlayo le  mali,  zingakayifaneli.  Siyabonga  kodwa-ke
ngoba kukhona lapho kuye kuphumelele khona ukuthi ziboshwe.

Ngithi kumhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe ngifuna  ukuma  endaweni  eyodwa,  ngigxile
kuyo. Kunezingane ezingenabani, izingane  ezidinga  ukusizwa,  kodwa  ngenxa
yomthetho,  okuye  kutholakale  ukuthi  azikwazi   ukusizakala.   Ngikhuluma
ngengane mhlawumbe  esuke  ifelwe  umzali  oyedwa,  kwasala  oyedwa.  Kuleyo
ngane, noma ngabe kufunekani kuyo, kuthiwa:  Ukhona  umzali  osekhona.  Kuye
kube nenkinga yokuthi mhlawumbe lowo  mzali  akasebenzi  nhlobo,  futhi  ibe
ingekho into angayenza ngenxa yokuthi  umthetho  awuvumi.  Kuye  kube  khona
ingane  engenabo  bobabili  abazali,  esala  emndenini.  Kuthi  uma   umuntu
eyihambisa  laphaya  kwabezenhlalakahle  bafike  umuntu  bamthumele   kulaba
bezinhlangano okungezona ezikahulumeni.

Mhlawumbe, uma oyedwa umzali elahlekile, baye bafike lapho  bathi  makafunwe
noma mabafunwe.  Ngenkathi  kufunwa,  kuyothatha  mhlawumbe  unyaka  kufunwa
abazali.  Kuqala  ngokuthi  kuthiwe  umuntu   akalethe   izithombe   ezizoya
emaphephandabeni. Emuva kwalokho kufunwe  lokhu,  umuntu  aze  abone  ukuthi
nalabo  bomndeni  sebeyakhathala  ngoba  noma  esethi  uyocela  ukuthi   ake
banikezwe phela okungamathikithana okucosha ukudla, njengoba uHulumeni  ethi
akekho umuntu okufanele alale engadle lutho esiswini sakhe,  kuye  kungaveli
lutho. Kodwa, ngenxa yalezi zinhlangano okungezona ezikahulumeni,  mhlawumbe
ngenxa yobudedengu bazo, kuye kutholakale  ukuthi  kukhona  umuntu  okuphela
iminyaka  emibili   kuya   kwemithathu   engakaze   acoshe   lutho   lukhona
olukaHulumeni.

Bengithi-ke ngizogxila kulokho  impela  ukuthi  kungenziwa  njani  ukuze  lo
mkhuba unciphe ngoba kungumkhutshana impela okhona  nakithi  KwaZulu.  Kodwa
noma umuntu  angaya  emNyangweni,  kufike  kuthiwe  akukho  ezandleni  zawo.
Umuntu aye kulabo okuthiwa kusezandleni zabo afike  abone  nje  ukuthi  nabo
bayazidonsa ngale nto, abazimisele  ukusiza  abantu  bakithi  abahluphekile.
Mhlawumbe, banezinhloso zabo engingazi ukuthi ngingathi ziyini.

Bengicela ukuthi sengathi le nto kungaba iyona impela  ebhekisiswayo  ngoba,
njengamanje, iyona esiphethe kanzima, ikakhulukazi thina  esihlala  nabantu,
phansi. Ekuseni nje bekufanele  ukuthi  ngiye  kusonhlalakahle  ngiyokhuluma
naye.  Ngikhulumile  naye  wangithembisa.  Ekugcineni,  ntambama,   ngithole
ukuthi usazoya kocela kumphathi ukuze  abhale  nje  incwadi.  Osonhlalakahle
bomNyango  bathe  akeze  nencwadi,  bona-ke   bebezokukhipha   lokho   kudla
ebengikucela. Kodwa kube  nenkinga  yokuthi  usonhlakahle  ubesazoya  kocela
kumphathi imvume yokubhala incwadi. Yilokho-ke engithi ake kulungiswe  ngoba
mhlawumbe  akugcini  KwaZulu.  Nakwezinye  izifundazwe  kunokwenzeka  ukuthi
yinkinga ekhona, nasezweni lonke.

Noma   kunjalo-ke,   ngithi   mangibambe   iqhaza   lokubonga   kumhlonishwa
uNgqongqoshe  ngomsebenzi  awenzayo,  ikakhulukazi   njengoba   ethi   ubeka
izingane phambili. Siyathokoza thina KwaZulu ngokuthi  siye  simbone  ehamba
nomhlonishwa  uNdabezitha  bezosebenza  umsebenzi   wokuhlupheka   kwabantu.
Sengathi lokho ngempela kungaqhubekela phambili.

Ngithi  futhi  mangibonge  kumhlonishwa  ngemisebenzi  yama-flagships  ngoba
siwabonile  eqala  futhi  okuhle  ukuthi  asiza  abantu   besifazane.   Nabo
bakhombisa umdlandla kule nto abayinikwayo. Sengathi kuphela-ke  angaqhubeka
abe maningi ngoba  phela  KwaZulu,  njengoba  kuzwakala,  nezibalo  zinkulu.
Konke kungaka, okusho khona  ukuthi  singabantu  basezulwini,  sinesibusiso,
sibaningi kakhulu, futhi sanikwa kakhulu konke.

Ngithi angithandi ukuchitha isikhathi sikaNgqongqoshe  kodwa  uma  kunikezwa
abantu besifazane izinto, njalo nje ngiye  ngithande  ukubonga  ngoba  phela
thina  senesibusiso  sokuba   umgogodla   wesizwe.   Singumgogodla   wendlu,
ngaphandle komuntu wesifazane ayikho indlu. Kodwa, uma inomuntu  wesifazane,
noma behlupheke benjalo, kuyadliwa endlini.

Ekugcineni,  ngithi  kumhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe  siyalubona  lolu   bhubhane
olukhona, nezingane zisele. Kodwa-ke, yikho  nje  siqinisa  ukuthi  sengathi
abantu besifazane  bangahlonyiswa  kakhulu  ukuze  bakwazi  ukukhusela  lezi
zintandane ezishiywa ngabazali bazo. Umuntu uyabona ukuthi kumanje  kunzima.
Siyaseseka lesi  sabiwomali.  [Kwaphela  isikhathi.]  (Translation  of  Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Ms M Xulu (KwaZulu-Natal): Hon Chairperson, I would like to greet  the  hon
Dr Skweyiya and all the hon members in the House.

If one looks at this allocation, it looks quite substantial, but because  of
the many challenges that it has to accommodate, it is, in fact, meagre.  The
people to whom it is allocated are just too many. At  the  same  time  there
are those criminals who pocket this money while they have  not  reached  the
appropriate age to be granted such money. We  are,  however,  thankful  that
there are instances where they are successfully arrested.

I would like to say to the hon the Minister that I  want  to  focus  on  one
area - the orphaned children who need assistance, but who,  because  of  the
legal system, are not assisted. I have in mind, for example, a  child  whose
one parent has died while  the  other  one  survives.  Whatever  that  child
needs, he or she is told that  there  is  a  surviving  parent.  It  becomes
problematic if that parent is unemployed, and there is usually nothing  that
he or she can do because of the legal system which does not allow him to  do
anything.

There are children who lose both of their parents. Such children  are  cared
for by the extended families. If one  takes  such  a  child  to  the  social
workers, they in turn refer one to the  NGOs.  If  one  parent  disappeared,
those social workers usually say that steps must be taken  to  find  him  or
her. That process of trying to locate lost parents may take  a  whole  year.
In the first place one is requested to bring photos which  will  go  to  the
newspapers. Thereafter, one is told to bring this and that, so much so  that
the family begins to despair. Even when one pleads for  that  family  to  be
given food coupons, since the Government  says  that  nobody  should  go  to
sleep on an empty stomach, nothing materialises. But, because of  the  NGOs,
perhaps through their negligence, some people end up not receiving  anything
from the Government for a period of up to two or three years,  whilst  there
are resources that are available from the Government.

I want to focus on what needs to be done to eliminate that practice  because
it is prevalent even in my province, KwaZulu-Natal.  However,  even  if  one
goes to the department, one is told  that  the  matter  is  not  within  its
jurisdiction. When one goes to those who are supposed to be responsible  for
those matters, one finds that they drag  their  feet  regarding  the  issue.
They are not prepared to help our poor people. Perhaps they have  their  own
ulterior motives which are unknown to me.

I am requesting that more attention should be focused on that issue.  It  is
our main problem, especially we who spend time with  the  people  at  grass-
roots level. This morning I had an  appointment  with  a  social  worker.  I
spoke to her and she made promises to me. Ultimately, I  found  out  in  the
afternoon that she would have to get permission from the one  in  charge  in
order just to write a letter. The social workers of the department said  all
she needed to do was just to bring the letter to them, then would then  have
seen to it that the food that I had requested  was  issued.  But  there  was
that problem of the social worker having to first ask the one in charge  for
permission to write a letter. That is what I would  like  to  see  addressed
because, perhaps, this is not only limited to  KwaZulu-Natal.  It  is  quite
possible that  that  problem  is  also  prevalent  in  other  provinces  and
throughout the country.

Be that as it may, I would like to thank the Minister for the work  that  he
does, particularly since he says he is championing the  cause  of  children.
We from KwaZulu-Natal want to commend him because we sometimes  see  him  in
the province together with the MEC for social development when  they  attend
to the plight of people. I really hope that that will succeed.

I would also like to thank the Minister for the flagship projects.  We  have
seen them being initiated and what is admirable is that women  benefit  from
them. Women have also shown enthusiasm for what is given to  them.  However,
we wish that more could be introduced, because,  as  the  figures  indicate,
there is a dire need  in  KwaZulu-Natal.  Everything  there  comes  in  huge
sizes. That means we are people of the heavens and  we  are  blessed.  There
are too many of us and we are well endowed with everything.

I would not like to waste the Minister's time,  but  I  am  always  thankful
when something is done for women, because we are blessed,  as  the  nation's
backbone. We are the backbone of a house  and  without  women  there  is  no
house. But if there is a woman in a house, no matter how poor,  she  manages
to find food to eat.

Finally, I would like to say to the Minister that we are quite conscious  of
the pandemic that is ravaging the country. Children have been left on  their
own. That is why we urge that women should be given skills and resources  so
that they can look after the orphans. One does see that things are,  indeed,
very tough. We support this Budget Vote. [Time expired.]]

... social development is one area in which our work as Government is  never
done, because no matter what we do we will always have  people  needing  our
services, especially the most vulnerable in our  communities.  But  what  is
highly commendable to all of those in the department  is  that  despite  the
odds stacked against them, they continue to make a  difference  to  people's
lives.

The department's budget is structured  in  such  a  way  that  it  primarily
consists of the payment of  social  grants  and  the  putting  in  place  of
poverty alleviation programmes to help  improve  the  lives  of  our  people
living in poverty, some of  whom  live  in  abject  poverty  with  the  most
atrocious living conditions imaginable.

What we have recognised in South Africa is that pushing back  the  frontiers
of poverty is not something that will magically happen overnight,  but  that
should not deter us in our efforts. We have to  continue  to  be  consistent
and persistent, because whatever initiatives we undertake, they will make  a
real difference to the lives of the individuals or group that we do reach.

Partnerships with stakeholders in both the public and  private  sectors  can
assist Government in being vigilant and alerting them to areas that need  to
be addressed urgently, or to areas  that  need  improved  service  delivery,
following the Batho Pele principles. The NGO sectors, in particular, play  a
valuable role in creating awareness around  pertinent  issues  and  bringing
them to our attention so that we can formulate the  necessary  remedies  and
improvements.

One such example is a report presented to our committee by the Alliance  for
Children's Entitlement to Social Security,  Acess.  We  were  moved  by  the
words  of  the  children  who  spoke  out  on  poverty  as  they  personally
experienced it in their homes and communities, and by their appeal to us  in
Government to make a difference in their lives.

Acess met with the department and ran workshops with vulnerable children  in
all nine provinces, focusing on children with disabilities,  those  infected
with and affected by HIV/Aids,  those  living  on  farms,  those  living  in
informal settlements or on the street and those in foster care in  order  to
ascertain the impact that poverty has on their lives. Their  research  shows
that three in every four children - approximately 70% - experience  poverty,
with 25% experiencing stunted  growth  owing  to  malnutrition.  Almost  all
these children face discrimination,  isolation  and  extreme  hardship,  the
likes of which we, sitting here in Parliament, have never experienced.

Some of the most enlightening  utterances  to  come  from  these  vulnerable
children were the responses they gave when asked what they would do  with  a
basic income grant valued at R100 per month. Contrary to our  preconceptions
that they would squander the money on junk food and the like,  the  children
demonstrated that they intended to spend the money on items such  as  mealie
meal, meat, school fees, rent, clothes, etc.

Even more remarkable is that these responses came  from  children  who  were
aged seven, eight and older. There were children who knew what  hunger  was.
There were children who understood far too well exactly what it meant to  be
poor.

All our national and provincial budgets should reflect  the  ways  in  which
the vulnerable are being  taken  care  of.  Our  focus  on  children  should
include ways in which we cut out all  the  red  tape  involving  adults  who
cause unnecessary delays in accessing funding earmarked for children.

The children themselves reflected on the fact that when they were  homeless,
without a specific adult care-giver  or  in  child-headed  households,  they
were unable to access any social security. Some of  their  suggestions  were
that the grants for children  be  given  directly  to  the  children  either
through bank accounts or by way of free food, uniforms and schooling.  Maybe
this  is  something  the  Minister  and  his  department  should   seriously
consider.

Our children have spoken out on poverty. Let us encourage the department  to
eliminate the capacity constraints that are  preventing  the  implementation
of the policies and programmes developed by the national department. Let  us
call on all MECs to improve the skills levels of social  security  staff  in
provinces, and to improve poor  infrastructure,  especially  in  the  poorer
rural provinces, as it continues  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  pension
paypoints and other service delivery areas.

To the Minister of Social Development and to all his staff, I would like  to
say that we know that the department impacts directly on the  lives  of  the
most vulnerable. They must keep on pushing back the  frontiers  of  poverty.
[Applause.]

Mr N V E NGIDI (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, let me start by  congratulating
the Minister on his policy speech as it gave  us  a  clear  picture  of  the
great strides the department is making in the struggle  for  a  better  life
for all.

During a similar debate last year, the Minister had this to say: ``Time  may
pass but the  struggle  for  social  justice  continues.''  To  ensure  that
justice continues, we need to do the following. We  need  to  eradicate  the
disparities of the past and bring about equity in such a manner that  social
security beneficiaries access their grants; and we need to protect,  through
the social assistance programmes of  the  department,  the  most  vulnerable
sections of our society, in particular our children.

Child poverty gives cause for concern in this country. Research shows  that:
``Three in every four children, approximately 70%, experience poverty,  with
25% stunted due to malnutrition. These  children  face  shortages  of  food,
clothing, shelter and access to  basic  services.''  Our  response  to  this
crisis should be to ensure that our social security network is such that  no
child is open to a life of destitution. We need to improve  our  system  and
close the gaps in the existing provisions through which many children fall.

While the Government has made great strides in eradicating  the  disparities
of the past with regard to our children, serious weaknesses still exist.  In
particular, the child support grant and the foster care  grant  need  to  be
strengthened.

With regard to the child support grant, we need to attend to the  following.
The slow intake, as evidenced by  the  fact  that  we  are  still  far  from
reaching  our  target,  needs  to  be  attended  to.  We  need  to  consider
capacitating provinces further via conditional grants so that they are  able
to speed up the intake. The issuing of birth certificates leaves much to  be
desired. This is worsened by the hostile attitude of  some  civil  servants.
While Ministers talk and make plans,  let  us  also  see  them  implementing
plans to  transform  the  mindset  of  the  Public  Service.  Owing  to  the
destitution of the parents of beneficiaries, grants are diverted  away  from
the children. This needs to be addressed. Either we have a grant  for  these
parents or we improve our poverty alleviation programmes.

Children aged between 7 and 18 are out of the net of beneficiaries. Some  of
them are orphaned and have absolutely  nowhere  to  go.  This  calls  for  a
relook into our social  assistance  programmes.  Perhaps  a  debate  on  the
findings of the Taylor commission may help us find answers.

With  regard  to  foster  care  grants,  the  following  problems  must   be
addressed. The children's court staff are not easily accessed. These  courts
need to  be  held  more  regularly  than  at  present.  Human  resources  at
provincial  departments  need  to  be  addressed.  We  have  to  ensure  the
facilitation of statutory supervision of children in  foster  placement  and
also the compilation of their home  circumstances.  Budgetary  consideration
will have to be given to equipping social workers  to  meet  needs  such  as
transport, computers and other equipment.

Let me conclude by saying that we need to speed up the process of  improving
our social  assistance  programmes  in  as  far  as  they  affect  children.
Children are an  important  resource  of  this  country.  If  we  eradicated
poverty, where they are concerned, in a way  that  enabled  them  to  access
basic needs such as education, health  care,  housing  and  food,  then  the
future of  this  country  would  be  assured.  We  need  to  pay  particular
attention to the improvement of our social assistance net so that no  single
child is a victim of  poverty.  More  importantly,  we  need  to  strengthen
community and family structures and to empower them economically to be  able
to deal poverty a telling blow. [Applause.]

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, when  one  is  the  19th  speaker  out  of  20
speakers and knowledgeable people have spoken before one, one is  left  with
nothing to say and one's speech becomes irrelevant.  Hence,  now  I  am  not
even going to look at the speech I came to the House with because I  do  not
want to bore people.

I  am  just  going  to  touch  on  a  few  issues  dealing  with  the  ANC's
perspective, what we as the ANC have  said  when  we  were  drawing  up  the
policies  -  long  before  1994  -  and  when  we  were   drawing   up   the
Reconstruction and Development Programme. I am  going  to  do  this  in  the
context of pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

I just want to touch on a few abstract issues. We have a  culture  in  which
we talk about rights and tell our children that they  have  rights,  but  in
terms of this there is one issue on which we never put emphasis  and  it  is
that these rights go along with responsibilities. I appeal  to  this  House,
when we move out of this, to please always emphasise to  our  children  that
these rights go along with responsibilities.

People have spoken about the child support grant, and a  member  has  spoken
about birth registration. But I say, let us not  only  look  at  the  public
servants, but also at ourselves. If ever one  sees  napkins  in  the  street
where one stays, one should find out from one's friends  whether  they  have
registered their child. This is the method; this is what one should do.  Let
our constituency offices also be centres  which  deal  with  the  issues  of
birth registration, and not only public servants.

There is a movement which has just been launched, which is called the  Moral
Regeneration Movement. I am not very clear about  it  as  I  just  have  the
framework of what this movement will be about. When we  talked  about  this,
we talked about the involvement  of  youth.  Let  us  also  talk  about  the
involvement of people under the age of 18 as we go along with this  movement
of moral regeneration, because the things children who are now five and  six
years old are learning from us are, they may think, the right things in  the
long  run.  So  let  us  start  with  them  now  on  the  issues  of   moral
regeneration.

An  issue  everybody  has  spoken  about   is   integrated   strategies   of
development. Something I  want  to  refer  to  in  this  regard  is  health.
Regarding promotive and preventive aspects, all of us and  those  in  Social
Development,  tend  to  only  be  concerned  about  treatment,  clinics  for
children to get medicine, etc, forgetting  the  most  important  issue,  the
number one issue. This is promoting health, that is,  health  education  and
preventive education. Let us be proactive and not only interventionist.

Regarding HIV/Aids and drugs, I appeal to  the  House  that  we  catch  them
young. Let us ensure that even in the crèches they talk about HIV/Aids.  Let
us be clear about it. Let us talk to our  children  of  five  years  old  in
crèches, and tell the girls what will happen if they do  certain  things.  A
girl has her own body, and another person has a different  body  from  hers.
These are the issues that we have to make them understand, so let  us  catch
them young.

When I talk about children and targeting the places  where  the  very  young
ones are found, there is also one institution to which most  of  us  belong,
and that is the church. The churches have  what  is  called  Sunday  school,
which caters for children up to the age of 18.  The  time  has  passed  when
they only had to be taught that Jesus Christ was  born  in  Bethlehem.  They
have to be taught the realities and it is us, the members of  the  churches,
who have to see to the curriculum of the Sunday schools.

My last point is about reading. We usually think that reading  is  an  issue
for the Department of Education, but we must teach our  people  the  culture
of reading from a young age, four and five years old. As  we  teach  them  a
culture of reading, they are going to be  able  themselves  to  see  certain
things, even before we talk to them. The curious child will come to one  and
say: I have read about this. What does it mean? Also, ourselves as  parents,
have to pass on a culture of reading to our children.

Unfortunately, our grandparents were not literate. They may  not  have  done
this, but it is high time for us as grandparents and parents to  treat  this
culture of reading, which is not necessarily only about doing  homework  and
reading broadly, as an issue of social development. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, I  thank  the  hon  members
for their contributions.  The  fight  against  poverty  requires  more  than
giving money to people, but must be conducted  in  a  manner  that  empowers
people, recognises their  human  dignity  and  respects  their  basic  human
rights.

Building a  new  system  of  social  development  for  the  country  is  not
something that will be achieved in a day. It is  a  long  process.  We  have
heard from almost all members that progress is being  made,  and  that  this
progress cannot only have been coming from Government  alone.  It  has  also
come from all members of society, including the private sector,  faith-based
organisations and nongovernmental organisations. More importantly,  progress
has and does involve hon members themselves.

I am heartened by the common theme echoed  in  this  House  today.  Fighting
child poverty is a priority and we must all work together in  the  interests
of the children of South Africa.

Quite a number of members have raised the issue of  the  inaccessibility  of
identity documents and, more importantly, the issue  of  birth  certificates
for children. It is an issue that we have been tackling  together  with  the
Department of Home Affairs. I think that hon members have many a time  heard
the Minister of Home Affairs appeal openly and publicly that  there  is  not
enough money in that department. Without enough resources, it would  not  be
possible for us working together to be able to attain what we both  want  to
do.

But, I think, I can report  to  members  that  we  have  been  working  very
closely together in many other ways. There is the example  of  Mount  Frere,
where we went out, and also of many other  areas.  The  Department  of  Home
Affairs sent out some mobile units in order to  be  able  to  register  more
children. More children were able to get birth certificates and  access  the
child support grant.

We aim to go to many other areas, specifically in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-
Natal, the Northern Province and the Free State, in other words, the  former
Bantustans, but we cannot do this as long as there is not  enough  money  in
the budget. It costs money, and there is not enough staff  to  do  the  job.
Hence, we are appealing to our people to assist us in one  way  or  another.
We appeal to the youth to volunteer,  to  write  down  the  names  of  these
children and bring the names forward  so  that  we  can  work  together  and
ensure that we reach as many children as possible.

I heard Mrs Vilakazi raising the issue of money that had not been  spent.  I
am not aware of any money that has not been spent in any province. But  what
we would like to explain is that the money does not come automatically.  The
money has to be finished and they have to come  back  to  account  for  that
money. If they cannot account for that money we cannot give them money.

So, it is on this basis that some of the projects have not been able to  get
the amount of money I am talking about, because they have only been able  to
account for two tranches. The third tranche, the last one, is not given  out
in many instances, because they have to account for the money.  As  soon  as
they are able to account for the money which, I think, this  month  some  of
them have been able to do, then they will get their money.  But  that  means
they are behind, because we have already started in  other  areas  with  the
R100 million for this year. The hon member understands what I am  trying  to
say?

Asinakubanika mali bengekagqibi kwaleya yokuqala ze basixelele  ukuba  benze
ntoni ngayo. Bakuyigqiba laa mali kufuneka baze ngaphambili  sibanike  imali
yabo, kodwa ke njengokuba besiza emva kwexesha nje  abakwazi  kuyifumana  le
sesiyiqale ngo-Apreli ngoba abakwazi nokutsho ukuba  benze  ntoni  na  ngale
besibanike  yona  kuqala.  Iyavakala  keloo  nto?  (Translation   of   Xhosa
paragraph follows.)

[We cannot give them money before they have used up  the  first  amount  and
have submitted a report in which they account for it. When  they  have  used
up that money, they would have to come forward to us so that we  could  give
them their money, that to which they are entitled. But, because  they  would
be coming late, as we distributed money in April already, they  still  would
not be able to get it when and  if  they  cannot  account  for  the  initial
amount. Is that clear to people?]
That is what we are trying to say. I think that we have to be able  to  work
together and assist these programmes to do these things, because it  is  not
because people do not want to use the money. It is because we are not  going
there to assist them in how the money is used and how they have  to  account
for it. That is where the main problem is at  the  present  moment.  But,  I
think, all in all a lot of progress has been made by many projects.

Ms Gouws raised quite a number of problems of concern, which  I  share.  The
take-up rate, for instance, in the care dependency grant,  something  I  was
telling the press about. The numbers  are  too  low,  specifically  for  the
Eastern Cape, the Northern Province, Limpopo and the  Free  State.  I  think
there is a need for all of us to work together to ensure that  the  children
in this grade of care dependency receive more. We are concentrating  on  and
prioritising that area in our child national registration campaign.

I also agree with the hon member  that  the  administrative  procedures  are
very cumbersome and that there is a need to accelerate them. I  think,  with
the introduction of these new panels, which started about a month ago,  this
will move a little bit faster than at the present moment.

I do not think I want to answer Mrs Motshekga, because she is the MEC. I  do
not think she wanted an answer, but rather comment  on  the  issues.  But  I
have, to a certain extent, answered her.

The hon Jacobus was commenting on things that ought to be done and  that  we
are going to do together. But, in principle, I think that there  are  a  lot
of things that we can and must do together. There has been a big move  since
1994 or 1995 when these grants  were  not  there  for  the  African  people.
Somebody said that they have been increased two or  three  times  from  what
they were in 1994. But the numbers of people have increased. The  very  fact
that today we talk about 2,1 million children  throughout  the  country  who
get this  grant  is  an  improvement.  I,  personally,  do  not  think  that
Government as a whole and any MP should be satisfied with that.
There are millions of other children who are entitled  to  this  grant  that
ought to be receiving it. They do not  get  this  grant,  and  this  is  not
because they do not want to receive it. Sometimes people do not  know  about
it. When they do know, it is very difficult, as members  have  been  saying,
to access this grant. That is why we should work  together  to  ensure  that
everybody is in the know and that all of us put children first in  the  work
which we are doing.

The second question that I would like to raise very clearly is the issue  of
children with  disabilities  in  many  areas  of  this  country.  There  are
thousands of children who are entitled to this grant who do  not  know  that
they are entitled to it, because this grant does  not  stop  when  they  are
seven years old. It continues until  they  are  18,  sometimes  even  beyond
that. That is why we should work as members of  Parliament  to  ensure  that
those children are registered and that they do receive this grant.

Last, but not least, is something that everybody has been speaking  about  -
the issue of HIV/Aids. It is a reality - all of us agreed on that -  and  we
have to work together. But more emphasis has to be put on children.

The issue of children running around  the  countryside  without  anybody  to
look after them is of concern. All of us  as  parents,  South  Africans  and
responsible citizens ought to look after  those  children.  We  have  agreed
that ``umtwana wami ngumntwana wakho, umntwana wakho ngowami'' [my child  is
your child and your child is my child] and  that  children  are  everybody's
business. We should  put  that  into  reality  amongst  our  people  in  our
villages, in our communities and also on the streets.  We  should  not  find
children running around Cape Town begging in the streets. We should be  able
to do something as citizens of Cape  Town  to  ensure  that  we  keep  these
children in safe places, that they are not abused and  that  they  at  least
get three meals a day.

I am very pleased to say quite openly and very clearly  that  we  have  been
working very closely with all the MECs in all provinces to ensure that  this
does take place.  I  think  those  MECs,  myself  and  the  Government  need
everybody's support. It is our duty. We are all servants of our  people.  We
are all being paid for that  and  nothing  else.  We  are  all  driving  our
Mercedes Benzes and living very nicely, better than  before  1994.  This  is
because we have jobs and these jobs are to work  for  the  people.  That  is
what we are paid for and what  all  of  us  ought  to  do.  Whether  we  are
councillors, members of Parliament or ordinary public  servants  -  who  get
paid better than the majority of members of  Parliament  -  we  should  work
well for our people.

If  we  do  that,  unite  and  work  together   with   the   nongovernmental
organisations, civil society and the faith-based organisations and  link  up
with the private sector, we can make a difference. All of us can  make  sure
that no child goes to bed, as one member said, without a meal, and  that  no
child runs around the streets of  Cape  Town  or  Johannesburg  without  any
parent or anybody to look after him or her. These are our children, this  is
our country and we must make it better than it is today. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

                      PROBATION SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson and hon members,  thank  you
for the opportunity to address the NCOP on the occasion  of  the  debate  on
the Probation Services Amendment Bill.

The Bill is another significant milestone  in  the  Government's  effort  to
transform and further strengthen  our  country's  criminal  justice  system.
This is underpinned by our request to protect our society from all forms  of
criminality whilst, at the same time, upholding the rights  of  children  as
enshrined in our Constitution. In  this  regard,  the  introduction  of  the
amendment to the Probation Services Act, Act 116 of 1991,  will  go  a  long
way  in  ensuring  the  achievement  of  that  objective  and  fostering  an
integrated justice system.

The objectives of these amendments are the  following:  Firstly,  to  insert
definitions relevant to the  child  and  youth  care  system;  secondly,  to
insert the definition of ``family finder'' whose main function would  be  to
trace the parents or guardian of a child who is being prosecuted  so  as  to
make them available to assist the child  in  court;  thirdly,  to  introduce
assessment, support, referral and mediation services in respect  of  victims
of crime; fourthly, to introduce crime  prevention  strategies  through  the
provision of early intervention  programmes,  including  diversion  services
and family group conferencing; fifthly, to provide for the establishment  of
restorative  justice  programmes  and  services  as  part   of   appropriate
sentencing and diversion options; sixthly, to  provide  for  the  reception,
assessment and referral of an accused person  and  the  rendering  of  early
intervention   services   and   programmes,   the   investigation   of   the
circumstances of an accused person and the provision of  a  pretrial  report
on the desirability or otherwise of prosecution, and  the  investigation  of
the  circumstances  of  convicted  persons;  eighthly,  to  substitute   the
definition of supervision to  be  the  supervising  and  supervision  of  an
accused, convicted or sentenced person by a probation officer  in  terms  of
the provision of any law; ninethly, to provide for  appointment  and  duties
of assistant probation officers; and, lastly, to provide for the  assessment
of every child who is alleged to have committed an offence and who has  been
arrested as soon as may be reasonably possible after his or her arrest by  a
probation officer.

Our Constitution requires that  every  arrested  person  be  brought  before
court within 48 hours of being arrested. It also provides that a  child  can
only be detained as a measure of last resort. This provision echoes  Article
40 of the United Nations' Convention on  the  Rights  of  the  Child,  which
South Africa has ratified.

In  line  with  the  Constitution,  the  Department's   10-point   programme
prioritises addressing the problem of children in  conflict  with  the  law.
The problem of children in conflict with the  law  is  a  serious  challenge
facing the country at this point in time. It requires urgent  attention  and
the involvement of all sectors of our society.

Since 1996, 12  children  have  died  in  detention  in  South  Africa.  The
following children have died in detention. Stephen Dube, aged  11,  died  in
police cells in Waterval, Northern Province, on  18  February  1999.  Monica
Salfina Mkansi, aged 15, died in the Phalaborwa police cells on  6  December
1999. Gert Baartman, aged 15, died in the Fraserburg police  station  on  16
July 2000. Lebohang James Mofokeng, aged 17, died in  the  Bethlehem  police
cells on 8 August 2000. And Richard Armoed, aged  15,  died  in  the  Knysna
police station on 10 March 2001.

Children who have died in prison are Werner Coetzee, aged 16,  who  died  at
Odendaalsrus Prison on 28 May 1999; and Byron Ince, aged  14,  who  died  at
the Excelsior Place of Safety on 23  January  2001.  Children  who  died  in
reform schools are Andre van Zyl  Jordaan,  aged  17,  who  died  at  Porter
Reform School on 21 March 1999;  Petros  Chiloane,  aged  17,  who  died  at
Ethokhumalo Reform School on 24 January 2000; and Andile  Tawule,  aged  17,
who died at Ethokhumalo Reform School on 12 February last year.

The youth of Africa are not just our future; they are  the  essence  of  our
present. It is in the youth that our hopes and dreams are  invested.  It  is
they who will reap the long-term benefits of the new societies  and  nations
that we are now building. It is they who must be encouraged to fulfil  their
role in every dimension of the social, economic and political  life  of  our
continent.

Currently, there are 2 322 children under the age of 18  awaiting  trial  in
prison, and 1 767 children awaiting trial in social development facilities.

The introduction of this Bill seeks to provide a legislative framework  that
will further strengthen the department's initiatives relating  to  probation
services, already undertaken through pilot projects,  in  order  to  improve
service delivery. The department, with the assistance of donor funding,  has
started  establishing  assessment  and  referral  centres  for  children  in
conflict with the law, as well  as  the  one-stop  justice  centre  in  Port
Elizabeth. This centre was established in partnership with  the  Departments
of  Safety  and  Security,  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,   and
Correctional Services.

Furthermore, other pilot projects were introduced  through  the  appointment
of  assistant  probation  officers  in  the  Western   Cape,   Limpopo   and
Mpumalanga. At present, we have  60  assistant  probation  officers  in  the
country, and there are plans to  appoint  more.  These  assistant  probation
officers are involved in monitoring persons placed under  house  arrest  and
assessed by probation officers. Between September 1998  and  February  2002,
379 children were placed under the care  of  their  parents  and  under  the
supervision of probation  officers.  The  progress  of  these  children  was
monitored  by  assistant  probation  officers.  The  appointment  of   these
assistant probation officers will go a  long  way  in  providing  a  quality
service to children in conflict with the law.

The placement of children under the care of  their  parents  and  under  the
supervision of probation officers has cost benefits for the  state.  On  the
one hand, it costs an average of R94,60 per day for a child  awaiting  trial
in prison. On the other hand, a child under house arrest  costs  only  R2,69
per day. The added benefit of  this  programme  is  that  children  awaiting
trial under  the  care  of  their  parents  and  under  the  supervision  of
probation officers  are  provided  with  a  family  environment  which  will
enhance their wellbeing.

It should be noted that out of those  379  children,  188  had  their  cases
eventually withdrawn from court. This means that  188  children  could  have
been in prison awaiting trial for a year or longer,  have  had  their  lives
totally disrupted  and  their  schooling  interrupted  only  to  have  their
charges  ultimately  withdrawn.  The  department  plans  to  replicate  this
programme throughout the country, especially  in  rural  areas  where  these
services are inadequate.

The decision to place a child under the supervision of a probation  officer,
and  monitored  by  an  assistant  probation  officer,  must  obviously   be
carefully weighed up against the concerns for safety of the  community,  and
the process  of  assessment  is  essential  in  this  regard.  All  possible
measures need to be found to protect young people from further harm.  Whilst
holding young people accountable for their actions, it must be ensured  that
they do not become victims of the system itself.

We are moving from a paradigm of punishment to  a  paradigm  of  restorative
justice that takes  into  account  social  deprivation  and  immaturity.  We
cannot afford to let more children die or be brutalised in detention.

This process will require that we work in partnership  with  families,  law-
enforcement agencies, courts and, indeed, society as a  whole.  The  passing
of the Probation Services Amendment Bill will pave the  way  for  the  Child
Justice Bill, which was approved by Cabinet in November 2001 and is  due  to
be introduced in Parliament in the near future.

The department is currently involved in an intersectoral process led by  the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development to develop  a  detailed
budget and implementation strategy to support the Child Justice  Bill.  This
Bill and the Child  Justice  Bill  will  go  a  long  way  in  ensuring  the
realisation of our goal of putting children first.

The Probation Services  Amendment  Bill  will  provide  legal  certainty  to
innovative practitioners who  have  been  doing  their  best  to  provide  a
progressive and effective service.  It  will  help  to  ensure  equality  of
service provision so that all children in South Africa, as  well  as  adults
requiring assistance, may be provided with services of a  high  quality.  We
must work together to ensure a South Africa fit for children. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, as a person who  is  committed  to  building  and
strengthening families I will  be  very  brief.  I  would  not  want  to  be
responsible for the breaking up of families, because members were  not  able
to make their flights back to their  provinces  to  spend  time  with  their
families. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]

It has always been a priority of this Government to  make  the  children  of
this country our number one priority. This amending Bill  demonstrates  that
commitment. Through this amending Bill, probation officers will  be  obliged
to assess arrested children as soon as is reasonably possible  so  that  the
children's time in jail awaiting trial is reduced to the absolute minimum.

At the same time, with our committee amendments we have effected,  the  role
of assistant probation officer is clearly identified in relation to that  of
the probation officer. Both these categories have  pivotal  responsibilities
in the field of treatment and rehabilitation of offenders -  in  this  case,
minors - the care and treatment  of  victims  of  crime,  and  working  with
families and communities.

We recognise that there are too few of these  dedicated  workers.  In  fact,
there are only 685 of them, we were told, in the whole of South  Africa  who
have currently to take care of the over 4 000 children under the age  of  18
awaiting trial in prison and secure-care facilities.

This is definitely  a  human  resource  backlog  that  all  the  departments
dealing with the needs of children need to address and correct  as  soon  as
possible. It becomes increasingly urgent when we realise  that  12  children
have died in detention in South Africa since 1996 - the Minister also  spoke
about that. These were 12 young lives that we could ill afford to lose.

Another way in which we demonstrate putting children first  is  by  ensuring
that the families of children in conflict with the law are closely  involved
in the legal and  rehabilitation  processes.  This  is  so  that  even  when
families fail to appear in court for whatever reason, the state will  ensure
that a family finder will trace the parents or guardian and  bring  them  to
court in order to assist the child  while  his  or  her  case  is  processed
through the justice system.

In the select committee  we  were  all  very  impressed  by  the  SA  Police
Service's commitment to ensuring that children  are  taken  to  the  nearest
assessor as soon as they are able to, by whatever means at  their  disposal.
We listened to the Police Service articulating their shortage of  staff  and
the other problems and  challenges  that  they  were  facing.  They  are  as
committed as we are to protecting children from  the  harsh  realities  that
face them while they are in the holding cells.

When the principal Act was passed in 1991, the primary  focus  of  this  Act
was to provide for the establishment and implementation of programmes  aimed
at the rendering of assistance to and treatment of minors in  conflict  with
the law.

After watching the Special Assignment programme which all of  us  are  aware
of  on  Tuesday,  highlighting  the  corruption  at  Grootvlei  maximum   in
Bloemfontein and  the  subsequent  media  coverage  it  received  and  still
receives, one wonders if we have gone far enough to protect our children  in
jail. Therefore, this Bill could not have come at a more opportune time.

I am happy  that  at  least  those  alleged  offenders  within  Correctional
Services have been suspended with immediate effect. Clearly, we need  to  do
more to protect those children awaiting trial  in  prisons  and  secure-care
facilities, because offences are committed against them by the  very  people
who are supposed to be caring for them and protecting them.

I think that the  most  difficult  thing  to  accept,  besides  the  general
corruption practised by the officials from the  Department  of  Correctional
Services, was the fact that these warders would fetch  young  children  from
the juvenile section's cells and sell them  to  be  abused  by  the  already
convicted older prisoners. This kind of behaviour will never be accepted  in
South Africa, and the harshest of  punishments  should  be  imposed  against
those who abuse the trust we have placed in them to protect our children.
During the deliberations  on  the  Probation  Services  Amendment  Bill  all
parties were in total agreement with the additional amendments  we  made  to
the Bill. We therefore  place  the  Bill  before  the  House  for  adoption.
[Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, the chairperson of my committee set  the  example
of speed. I just want to ask  my  colleagues  to  stick  to  the  debate  on
children and to what we are busy  talking  about.  This  other  business  of
underestimating our intelligence is becoming rather irritating.

The Probation  Services  Act,  Act  116  of  1991,  provides  for  probation
services to be rendered to accused and convicted  persons  in  the  criminal
justice system. An important element of the  department's  plan  deals  with
children in conflict with the law. The practice of children  being  assessed
by probation officers after they have been arrested has  a  bearing  on  how
the matter should be  dealt  with.  Diversion  of  children  away  from  the
criminal  justice  system  into  suitable  programmes  is,  in  itself,   an
innnovation that has developed in the last decade in our country.  In  2001,
approximately 15 000 children were diverted into programmes. At  this  point
in time there are 2 322 children under the age  of  18  in  prison  awaiting
trial, and 1 767 children awaiting trial in social development facilities.

The Constitution guarantees the rights of children, and one of these  rights
is only to be imprisoned or detained as a last resort. One  of  the  reasons
for this is to prevent the contamination of first-time offenders  by  other,
more hardened, criminals.

The Bill seeks to achieve early  intervention  and  assessment  of  juvenile
criminals with a view  to  breaking  the  cycle  of  criminality.  My  party
welcomes the amendments, but we have a  problem  with  the  practicality  of
giving effect to the provisions of the new clause 4B, which provides:


  Every child who is alleged to have committed an offence and who has  been
  arrested shall, as soon as may be reasonably possible after  his  or  her
  arrest, be assessed by a probation officer.
Do we have the staff to implement this? The department says  that  there  is
currently 60 probation officers, with 82 probation officers  employed  full-
time in a management capacity. We are  worried  that  staff  shortages  will
mean that assessments will  take  longer  than  48  hours.  If  a  child  is
released without assessment or detained for a longer period, it will  expose
them to precisely the criminal elements that this Bill seeks to avoid.

In the words of  the  hon  Minister,  let  us  believe  that  the  Probation
Services  Amendment  Bill  will  provide  legal  certainty   to   innovative
practitioners who have been doing their best to provide  a  progressive  and
effective service, and that  all  children,  as  well  as  adults  requiring
assistance, may be provided with services of a high quality.

My party supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, I do not  know  if  I
should respond to my colleague from the DP, but I  just  want  to  say  that
instead of criticising, we should help the hon Minister, the Government  and
our President. Every one of us has a responsibility to  improve  the  plight
of our people, as our hon Minister has already stated. We have an  Afrikaans
saying  which  goes:  ``Benoude  katte  maak  benoude  spronge  en   benoude
geluide'' [They are like cats on a hot tin roof.]

This country has the responsibility of protecting  its  children  against  a
dark future of crime and resultant imprisonment, which can be the  start  of
a vicious cycle from which some people never escape.  The  New  NP  believes
that a big part of this decay can be contributed to  the  breakdown  in  the
family system, partly because parents simply fail to fulfil  their  parental
duties and partly because the  economy  of  the  day  is  conducive  to  the
creation of a generation of youth  that  are  of  the  opinion  that  it  is
acceptable to commit certain types of crime.

I believe that we all agree that the transformation of the child  and  youth
care system is long overdue. Although the Bill before us  today  only  seeks
to act as an interim measure to facilitate this transformation process,  any
steps to address the problem of child and youth care should be welcome.

We believe that the 48-hour mandatory restriction period for  assessment  of
every arrested child should go a long way in  speeding  up  the  process  of
either getting the child back to his or her family or setting in motion  the
assessment and referral process. The Bill makes  provision  for  the  speedy
investigation of the circumstances of the accused and  the  provision  of  a
pretrial report. Identifying a family finder, whose main function  would  be
to trace the parents or guardian of  the  child  who  is  being  prosecuted,
strengthens the whole process.

In die finale  instansie  verwelkom  die  Nuwe  NP  die  instelling  van  'n
advieskomitee  oor  proefdienste  wat  die   Minister   kan   adviseer   oor
proefdienste in die land. Hierdie liggaam sal hopelik daartoe bydra dat  die
proses voortdurend aangepas sal word om te handel met die nuutste  behoeftes
wat mag ontstaan. Sodoende sal op die bes moontlike wyse gehandel  word  met
kinders, sodat hulle so gou as moontlik hul plek  as  gerehabiliteerde  lede
van die samelewing kan inneem.

Die Nuwe NP steun die Wetsontwerp op Proefdienste.  [Applous.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In the final analysis the New NP welcomes the introduction of  a  probation
advisory committee that can advise the Minister  with  regard  to  probation
services in the country. It is hoped that this body will contribute  to  the
process for dealing with the latest  needs  that  may  arise  being  adapted
continually. In so  doing  the  children  will  receive  the  best  possible
treatment, so that they could take their places as rehabilitated members  of
society as expediently as possible.

The New NP supports the Probation Services Amendment Bill. [Applause.]]

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, it is a  well-known  fact  that  our  Constitution
ranks amongst the best in the world. It dwarfs and puts  to  shame  many  of
the constitutions of  countries  that  have  had  more  than  200  years  of
experience in democracy. What makes it outstanding,  amongst  other  things,
is the Bill of Rights enshrined in it. This Bill of  Rights  is  unambiguous
on the rights of children. Section 28(1)(b) says that every  child  has  the
right to ``family care or parental care, or to appropriate alternative  care
when removed from the family environment''. Section 28(1)(g) says, in  part,
that every child has the right not to be detained. It then goes on  to  give
the conditions under which a child be detained.

The apartheid regime stands  accused  of  having  neglected  the  rights  of
children. In their many years of misrule in this country, that regime  never
dreamt for a moment of developing young people to their  fullest  potential.
Our children were exposed to the rigours of  life  at  a  very  tender  age.
Children were thrown into the deep end of life without being prepared.  This
resulted in a situation in which some young boys and girls could not  resist
becoming criminals. Therefore, this means that  the  apartheid  regime  made
our young children lumpen. As a new Government, we  cannot  and  should  not
leave the protection and development of our children to  chance,  hence  the
constitutional requirement to protect our young men and women.

Our  criminal  justice  system  today  is  not  based   on   vengeance   and
condemnation,  but  on  humane  principles  that   seek   to   correct   and
rehabilitate. The  Probation  Services  Act  of  1991  sought  to  implement
programmes aimed at combating crime and  to  render  assistance  to  certain
people involved in crime, amongst other things. That Act also  provided  for
the appointment of probation officers, whose  function  was  to  investigate
the circumstances of an accused, with a view  to  reporting  to  the  police
officer or presiding magistrate the possible treatment of and  or  committal
of the accused to an institution.

The present situation, given the policy  choices  of  this  Government,  has
found the above Act to be inadequate. To be able to fulfil  the  imperatives
of the new situation, a  need  arose,  therefore,  to  amend  the  Probation
Services Act, hence the Probation Services Amendment Act we  are  discussing
here today.

This Bill, amongst other things, provides for  the  restoration  of  justice
programmes  for  victims  of   crime   who   have   hitherto   always   been
disadvantaged.  There  was  no  provision  to  restore  the  situation  that
prevailed before the crime was committed. This system  seeks  to  provide  a
legal basis to restore the situation of the  victim  before  the  crime  was
committed. In our view, this will go a long  way  in  appeasing  victims  of
crime and enabling them to reconcile with the offenders  so  that  they  can
both live in harmony once more.

This  Bill  also  provided  for  the  appointment  of  assistant   probation
officers. We indicated earlier what the functions of the probation  officers
were. Owing to  objective  conditions  on  the  ground,  a  need  arose  for
probation officers to be helped. To do so, this Bill seeks to  legalise  the
appointment of assistant probation officers. This will  go  a  long  way  in
enhancing the work of probation officers. It will make them  more  effective
and efficient in their work, which will be to the advantage  of  young  boys
and girls who, from time to time, find themselves on the wrong side  of  the
law.

The department has told us that there have already been  pilot  projects  in
this respect and that they have yielded tremendous results. The  whole  idea
is to act with speed to prevent children from going  to  jail  and  to  find
alternatives for them. The supreme law of our country demands of  us  to  do
that, and this has  the  added  advantage  of  alleviating  the  problem  of
overcrowding in our prisons. These assistant probation  officers  will  also
be responsible for family finders. Many children are arrested and,  in  some
cases, even sentenced, without the knowledge of  their  families.  Sometimes
families, especially in the rural areas, do know about the arrest  of  their
children, but, owing  to  distances,  cannot  make  it  to  the  court.  The
assistant probation officers will do the noble  job  of  looking  for  these
family members and also assist them in getting  to  court  so  that  if  the
magistrate puts the child under family  supervision,  these  family  members
are  there  themselves  to  understand  the  conditions  under   which   the
supervision has to take  place.  These  officers  will  also  supervise  the
probationer to check that the conditions of probation are adhered to.

In conclusion, we want to say that this Bill is not a universal  remedy  for
our children who commit crime, but we have no doubt in  our  minds  that  it
will go a long way in addressing the problem. This will be  the  case  until
the introduction of the Child Justice Bill by Parliament. The  hon  Minister
has already referred to this Bill. It is only when  that  Bill  becomes  law
that we can safely say that we are dealing decisively with the problem.

The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF  SOCIAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  I  want  to  thank  hon
members for the contribution they have made and the advice they  have  given
to the department in the process of dealing with this  Bill,  and  also  for
ensuring that it is accepted and becomes part and  parcel  of  the  law.  We
will be putting in place one of the last building blocks of our  legislation
in our whole system to ensure that we have some legal  basis  to  guide  and
monitor our children whenever they have transgressed  the  law.  I  want  to
promise this House that we will work with them right throughout in  ensuring
that our children receive the necessary support and  guidance,  legally  and
otherwise, in our country. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 12:31.
