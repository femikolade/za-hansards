                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Miss M N MAGAZI: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  that  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  called  for  an
       immediate ceasefire and the establishment of a Palestinian state;
  (2) believes that everlasting peace  in  the  Middle  East  lies  in  the
       peaceful co-existence of the state of  Palestine  and  the  state  of
       Israel;


  (3) supports the call by the UN Security Council for a ceasefire; and


  (4) calls on all parties to work towards a  peaceful  resolution  of  the
       conflict in the Middle East.

[Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day
I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  with  disappointment  the  findings  of  the  South   African
       Government's  observer  mission  that  the  Zimbabwe  elections  were
       legitimate;


  (2) expresses its  concern  that  the  abuses  which  characterised  this
       election are considered acceptable by this Government;
  (3) believes that unless President Mbeki distances South Africa from  the
       abuses culminating in the Zimbabwe election result, we will embark on
       the same road towards contempt for the  rule  of  law  and  abuse  of
       executive power to thwart the will of the people; and


  (4) calls on President Mbeki  to  repudiate  both  the  findings  of  the
       Motsuenyane mission and the Mugabe victory as  fundamentally  flawed,
       in the interests of the people of Zimbabwe  and  the  whole  Southern
       African region.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) sadly notes the reports that cemetery space in both KwaZulu-Natal and
       Gauteng is diminishing due to the HIV/Aids pandemic;


  (2) further notes that on occasion people have had to be turned  back  at
       cemeteries, forcing them to opt for burials at places not  demarcated
       for such a purpose;


  (3) realises that cemetery authorities are gradually introducing a method
       of recycling graves and/or cremation to  African  communities,  which
       runs against their  tradition,  due  to  the  ecological  impact  and
       seepage into water supplies that these informal burials may cause;


  (4) therefore calls on the two metro areas to find alternative land  even
       as they embark on  a  public  relations  campaign  to  introduce  the
       perceived new methods; and


  (5) earnestly prays that the Government's pilot projects on  the  effects
       of nevirapine could yield positive results in eliminating the scourge
       of HIV/Aids.

Mr D C MABENA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the community of Mamelodi responded to the President's  call  of
           Vukuzenzele by joining police reservists;


       (b)  the success of this move resulted in the arrest of 48  criminals
           between February and March 2002; and


       (c)  two stolen cars, two cellphones and several other  stolen  items
           were recovered; and


  (2) commends the people of Mamelodi for heeding the call  of  Vukuzenzele
       and working with police in fighting crime in the area.


[Applause.]

Mr A BLAAS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day I shall move:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) fourteen national Government departments and constitutional  entities
       did not submit annual reports and audited financial statements within
       the period prescribed by the PFMA;


  (2) seven Schedule 2 entities did not  submit  such  reports  within  the
       prescribed period;


  (3) in only four  instances  were  written  explanations  tabled  by  the
       executive as is required by the PFMA when a report is submitted late;


  (4) where such explanations were tabled the nature and content  were  not
       always factually correct; and


  (5) the New NP finds it unacceptable that certain Government  departments
       do not comply with the rules of the PFMA and calls on  the  Ministers
       of the departments in question to get their act together.

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes a report in Die  Burger  newspaper  that  highly  sophisticated
       bugging and monitoring devices have been allegedly discovered in  the
       Western Cape Legislature buildings;


  (2) acknowledges that this discovery has the potential of becoming  South
       Africa's own Watergate scandal;


  (3) further notes that the equipment is allegedly capable  of  monitoring
       activities up to 4 km from its base;


  (4)  condemns  in  the  strongest  terms  the   monitoring   and   covert
       surveillance  of  public   representatives   and   their   legitimate
       activities;


  (5) calls upon Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on  Intelligence  to
       fully investigate the origins of  the  sophisticated  equipment,  the
       reasons for its installation, and whether as  a  result  thereof  any
       person has suffered victimisation; and


  (6) further calls upon the relevant authorities to  take  action  against
       the perpetrators.

Mr B A RADEBE: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the recommendation by the Black Economic Empowerment Commission
       of  a  legislative  framework  that  will  promote   black   economic
       empowerment by requiring companies to set targets and submit progress
       reports on the extent to which black economic  empowerment  has  been
       achieved;


  (2) further notes that the Government has  accepted  this  recommendation
       and is going to develop a legal framework for this purpose;


  (3) believes that this move will contribute positively  to  the  economic
       empowerment of historically disadvantaged people; and


  (4) welcomes the plans by Government to introduce a legal  framework  for
       black economic  empowerment  as  this  will  correct  the  historical
       imbalances created by apartheid colonialism.
[Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the concern of  the  law  society  about  lawyers  who  conduct
       themselves  in  an  unprofessional  manner  by  allegedly   enriching
       themselves;


  (2) notes further that 50 lawyers have  been  struck  off  the  roll  for
       various forms of unprofessional conduct;


  (3) welcomes the stand taken by the National  Association  of  Democratic
       Lawyers in condemning the conduct of such lawyers; and


  (4) urges the legal profession to remain honourable as it is  constituted
       by people of integrity.

Dr P W A MULDER: Geagte Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek namens die  VF
op die volgende sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis daarvan kennis neem dat -


  (1)  dit  uit  verskeie  verslae  duidelik  blyk  dat  die  pas  afgelope
       verkiesing in Zimbabwe geensins as vry en regverdig beskou  kan  word
       nie aangesien president Mugabe as  polisieman,  aanklaer,  regter  en
       jurie in die verkiesing opgetree het;


  (2) die verkiesing in Zimbabwe deur die wêreld as  'n  eerste  toets  vir
       president Mbeki en  Afrika  se  Nepad-inisiatief  gesien  word  -  'n
       inisiatief vir  die  bevordering  van  demokrasie  en  menseregte  in
       Afrika;


  (3) die gebeure in Zimbabwe daartoe lei dat die wêreld se  gevolgtrekking
       is dat hierdie inisiatief duidelik sy eerste toets gedruip het;


  (4)  indien  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  Regering  die  verkiesing  as  vry  en
       regverdig sou verklaar, Suid-Afrika onvermydelik baie  internasionale
       aansien en geloofwaardigheid sal verloor; en


  (5) wysheid en koelkoppe nodig sal wees om Zimbabwe en  Suidelike  Afrika
       met geloofwaardigheid uit hierdie krisis te stuur
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House takes note that -


  (1) from different reports it  is  clear  that  the  recent  election  in
       Zimbabwe could by no means  be  regarded  as  free  and  fair,  since
       President Mugabe acted  as  policeman,  prosecutor,  judge  and  jury
       during the election;


  (2) the election in Zimbabwe is seen as a first test  by  the  world  for
       President Mbeki and Africa's Nepad initiative- an initiative for  the
       promotion of democracy and human rights in Africa;


  (3) the occurrences in Zimbabwe have led to the world's conclusion  being
       that this initiative has clearly failed its first test;


  (4) if the South African Government declares this election  as  free  and
       fair, South Africa would  inevitably  lose  a  lot  of  international
       esteem and credibility; and


  (5) wisdom and cool heads will  be  needed  to  steer  South  Africa  and
       Zimbabwe out of this crisis with credibility.]

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that there is  no  international  practice  or  principle  that
       Public Accounts Committees are chaired by opposition parties;


  (2)  further  notes  that  this  was  confirmed  during  a  recent  Scopa
       delegation visit to Europe and also by the Auditors-General of France
       and the Philippines during their recent visits to South Africa;


  (3) therefore rejects the assertions of the DP that  the  appointment  of
       the hon Vincent Smith is permanent,  when  they  know  that  this  is
       temporary and in an acting capacity; and


  (4) confirms the commitment of the ANC to its policy of  sound  financial
       management  and,  notwithstanding   international   conventions   and
       practices, also confirms the commitment of the ANC  -  which  it  has
       held since the transition to a democratic dispensation in 1994  -  to
       the appointment of a chairperson of the Standing Committee on  Public
       Accounts from the ranks of the opposition.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the  scandals  surrounding  the  mayor  of  the  Nelson  Mandela
           Metropole and his gross mismanagement of public funds  cost  the
           public dearly, damage the reputation  of  the  city  and  impact
           negatively on the council's debt crisis;


       (b)  after 15 months the mayor has still not  appointed  a  municipal
           manager;


       (c)  bad debt has grown to R728 million, with  no  credit  policy  in
           place;


       (d)  the poorest of the poor are not receiving free  basic  services;
           and


       (e)  the municipal police force has not been established; and


  (2) requests the President to intervene to have Mayor Faku  removed  from
       office and so to meet his commitment that ``all  of  our  mayors  and
       councillors who fail  to  serve  the  people  or  engage  in  corrupt
       practice, will be exposed and removed from their positions.''

[Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) takes delight in the news that the  microlending  business  plans  to
       hold public workshops to  shape  up  the  loan-shark  image  of  this
       industry;


  (2) notes that registered microlenders contemplate deregistering with the
       Micro Finance Regulatory Council because there are many  unregistered
       microlenders who  got  away  with  it,  as  there  are  no  effective
       monitoring mechanisms to deal with the unregistered microlenders; and


  (3) appeals to the Department of  Trade  and  Industry  to  address  this
       matter in order  to  protect  consumers  who  might  find  themselves
       immersed in unscrupulous deals without any recourse to justice.

Mr R J B MOHLALA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the Minister of Public Enterprises, the  hon  Jeff  Radebe,
           announced that  Zama  Resources  Corporation  is  the  preferred
           bidder for 75% of Safcol forestry interests  in  Mpumalanga  and
           the Northern Province; and


       (b)  the statement by Safcol chairman, Mr David Gevisser, that ``Zama
           is the totally South African, 100% black empowerment group whose
           members have close affiliations with the forestry industry'';


  (2) believes that this reflects the commitment of the ANC-led  Government
       to  empower  the  historically  disadvantaged  communities   and   to
       transform the economy in a manner that contributes to a  better  life
       for all our people;


  (3) welcomes the announcement by the Minister of Public Enterprises,  the
       hon Jeff Radebe; and


  (4) congratulates Zama Resources Corporation on winning the bid.

[Applause.]

Mnr F BEUKMAN: Speaker, ek gee kennis namens die  Nuwe  NP  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1)  met  kommer  kennis  neem  van   die   dood   van   die   Italiaanse
       vryskutjoernalis, Raffaele  Ciriello,  gister  in  Ramallah  aan  die
       Wesbank;


  (2) terreuraanvalle op joernaliste betreur, soos die moord  op  die  Wall
       Street Journal -joernalis, Daniel Pearl, onlangs in Pakistan;
  (3) sy simpatie uitspreek teenoor die gesinne en naasbestaandes  van  die
       oorledenes;


  (4) 'n beroep op regerings wêreldwyd doen om toe te sien dat  joernaliste
       sonder inmenging, hetsy deur die  staat  of  politieke  organisasies,
       hulle werk kan doen;


  (5) saamstem dat die aanslag op  joernaliste  se  fisiese  veiligheid  'n
       inbreuk maak op hulle  vryheid  van  beweging  en  hulle  reg  om  te
       rapporteer, en dit ten sterkste veroordeel;


  (6) die situasie betreur dat 'n bekroonde joernalis  soos  Basildon  Peta
       van Zimbabwe nie vryelik en sonder teistering  van  staatsagentskappe
       in sy vaderland kan werk nie; en


  (7) 'n beroep op regerings doen en  om  toe  te  sien  dat  die  reg  tot
       inligting beskerm word, en die  boodskapper  nie  die  slagoffer  van
       ideologiese strydpunte word nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr F BEUKMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the death of  the  Italian  freelance  journalist,
       Raffaele Ciriello, yesterday in Ramallah on the West Bank;


  (2) regrets terror attacks on journalists, such as the murder of the Wall
       Street Journal journalist, Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan recently;


  (3) expresses its sympathy towards the families and next of  kin  of  the
       deceased;


  (4) appeals to governments worldwide to see to it that journalists can do
       their jobs without interference, be it  by  the  state  or  political
       organisations;


  (5) agrees that the attack  on  journalists'  physical  safety  restricts
       their freedom of movement and their right  to  report,  and  condemns
       this most strongly;
  (6) regrets the situation  in  which  an  award-winning  journalist  like
       Basildon Peta from Zimbabwe cannot work freely and without harassment
       by state agencies in his fatherland; and


  (7) appeals to governments to see to it that the right to information  is
       protected, and that the messenger  does  not  become  the  victim  of
       ideological issues of dispute.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with caution the  approval  by  Cabinet  to  increase  low-cost
       housing subsidies;


  (2) is of the opinion that the project increase in spending for the  next
       financial  year  should  be  welcomed,  with  the  proviso  that   it
       translates into better-quality houses as the quality  of  the  houses
       built at present is questionable, and as there  have  been  countless
       cases reported of defective and even dangerously inappropriate houses
       being erected;


  (3) proposes that the  focus  on  housing  policy  should  shift  towards
       ensuring  the  beneficiaries  are  provided  with  adequately  sized,
       serviced plots on which houses are built; and


  (4) calls on the Government to ensure that, rather than the present track
       record, the housing subsidy keep pace with the rate of inflation.

 CONGRATULATIONS TO DEPARTMENT OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY ON WATER GLOBE
                                    AWARD

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that South Africa received a Water Globe Award  amongst  1  300
       entrants from 98 countries;
  (2) recognises that the Department  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  is
       addressing an  enormous  backlog  in  the  delivery  of  basic  water
       services to all the people of  South  Africa  through  its  Community
       Water Sanitation Programme;


  (3) acknowledges that in meeting the water security and sanitation  needs
       of the poor, our Government is giving life to human rights  enshrined
       in our Constitution;


  (4) believes South Africa remains committed to the Millennium target  set
       by President Thabo Mbeki and 100 other heads of state at  the  United
       Nations to halve the number of people without safe water by 2015; and


  (5) congratulates the Department of  Water  Affairs  on  winning  such  a
       prestigious award.

Agreed to.

        CONGRATULATIONS TO MINISTER OF FINANCE ON HONORARY DOCTORATE
                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the  University  of  the  Western  Cape  conferred  an  honorary
           doctorate on the Minister of Finance, hon Trevor Manuel; and


       (b)  this was done in recognition of his role in the sound management
           of economic policies; and


  (2) congratulates Minister Manuel on receiving this doctorate.

Agreed to.

                 NOMINATIONS FOR SA HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION

                             (Draft Resolution)
The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the
draft resolution printed on today's Order Paper in the  name  of  the  Chief
Whip of the Majority Party, as follows:


  That the terms of reference of the ad  hoc  committee  appointed  by  the
  House on 2 November 2001 to nominate persons to fill pending vacancies on
  the South African Human Rights Commission be altered as follows:


  The Committee to nominate persons to fill the vacancies -


  (1) caused by the resignation of Dr N B Pityana, Adv F P Tlakula and Mr J
       Nkeli and report to the House thereon by 6 May 2002; and


  (2) that will arise as a result of the term of  office  of  commissioners
       expiring in September 2002 and report to the House thereon by 25 June
       2002.

Agreed to.

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, I am sorry to do this  to  you,  but  may  I
address you on an issue that is not in  keeping  with  the  decorum  of  the
House?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, hon member, address me.

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: I am reluctant to call it a point of order, Madam  Speaker,
because I am not sure what, in fact, it is. However, the hon Lee,  a  highly
paid public representative, tends  to  spend  his  whole  afternoon  in  the
Chamber waving around the DA logo. Firstly, that party  does  not  exist  in
this House. Secondly, I do not  think  it  would  be  in  keeping  with  the
decorum of this House if we all started doing it.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Hon  Lee,  do  you  want  to  respond  on  that  issue?
[Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, the hon Mr Doidge said that  it  was  not  a
point of order, so I am not quite sure what  it  is,  but  perhaps  I  could
point out that the hon Mr Lee does spend his whole time in the House in  the
afternoons and he does not fall asleep as very many other members do.  So  I
think it is quite good that he is showing how active  he  is.  There  is  no
rule which prevents him from having something which  reflects  the  DA,  and
that is a party which has the support of 2,5 million South Africans.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Gibson, please! I do not want you to make a  speech.
Could you just take your seat now. [Interjections.] I  want  to  respond  to
the issue.

I would like to have an opportunity  to  reflect  on  this  matter  because,
although it might not be an ordinary point of order as we  understand  them,
it  does,  however,  raise  an  important  matter  of  policy  in  terms  of
advertisement of a party, logos, and the extent to which that is  acceptable
in the House. So I would like to come back to this issue.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Mr  K  A  MOLOTO:  Madam  Speaker  and  hon  members,  this  Budget,  though
innovative in many respects, is a continuation of the  strategic  objectives
of the ANC Government set out, with the advent of  democracy,  in  order  to
realise growth objectives. It continues to balance, in a creative  way,  the
needs  for  development,  growth,  equity,  fiscal  discipline  and  revenue
collection.

This Budget has the hallmark of judicious management of public finances  and
continues  in   the   well-established   tradition   of   transparency   and
accountability in the expenditure of public finances.

The economic challenges facing this country are enormous, and  it  is  quite
understandable that a debate  on  the  country's  Budget  draws  such  great
interest and expectations, especially from the poor of this country.

A budget is always perceived to be a powerful tool  for  the  redistribution
of income and the allocation of resources, and to  ensure  overall  economic
efficiency. It  is  an  expression  of  the  political  orientation  of  any
government and exposes its character and position in relation to the poor.

Since its inception in 1994,  the  ANC  Government  has  channelled  massive
resources towards the improvement of the lives of  the  poor.  Major  Public
Works programmes, the  provision  of  basic  health  care,  especially  free
health care  to  pregnant  women  and  children,  have  contributed  towards
tightening the fabric of our society.

Indeed,  I  concede  that  the  challenges  are  enormous.  These   economic
challenges occur within the context of a slowdown in the economies  of  most
developed countries. It is worth noting that the  diversification  of  South
African manufacturing  exports  cushioned  us  from  experiencing  the  full
impact of the slowdown  in  global  economic  growth.  Manufactured  exports
increased from 9% in 1990, to 27% of total exports in 2001. On the  positive
side, the depreciation of the rand helped the performance  of  our  exports.
These exports will continue to rise as the global economy recovers.

We highlight the importance of these exports as our tax base and ability  to
address these socioeconomic challenges are linked to the performance of  our
economy. Indeed, economic growth is  necessary  for  the  redistribution  of
income, but it is not sufficient. Tax  and  expenditure  measures  serve  to
distribute income and alleviate poverty.

This Budget continues to advance  our  conviction  and  national  desire  to
redistribute income and services to the most vulnerable. There can never  be
enough. The challenge of poverty eradication is  huge.  The  plight  of  the
unemployed will continue to provoke our thoughts and  emotions  to  use  all
Government resources to address this problem.

Equally, all efforts should be taken to simplify  and  consolidate  the  tax
system where applicable  in  order  to  minimise  compliance  costs  of  the
business sector  and  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  the  South  African
economy.

It gives me pleasure to realise the tax relief that  is  extended  to  small
businesses. A R3 million turnover threshold relief  is  proposed  for  small
businesses.  Small  businesses  contribute  in   bringing   innovation   and
diversification to our economy. The  entrepreneurship  spirit  needs  to  be
rekindled in the lives of all South Africans. They know the  local  economic
dynamics are in a better position to respond with precision.

Tax  allowance  is  introduced  to   encourage   learnerships.   Accelerated
depreciation allowances are proposed to encourage  business  investment  and
employment. New manufacturing assets acquired within the three years from  1
March 2002 will be depreciated over four years. Forty per cent of  the  cost
of the asset will be deducted in the first year, and 20% of the cost in  the
subsequent three years. This allowance will only be available  to  taxpayers
in respect of assets used directly in  the  manufacturing  businesses.  This
will also serve to ease  the  impact  of  the  recent  depreciation  in  the
currency.

The 2002  Budget  is  expansionary.  Oriented  towards  growth,  the  Budget
broadens the  scope  of  benefits  in  social  services  and  infrastructure
investments. Real spending on services will grow by 4,1% over  a  three-year
period, while capital spending growth is budgeted to grow by 18%  per  annum
over the next three years. Let us  acknowledge  that  investment  in  social
services is as important as capital investment.

Provinces will receive R132,4 billion  to  cater  for  improved  funding  of
tertiary hospitals and an advanced response to HIV/Aids; to provide  for  an
increase in old age and disability grants; and  to  provide  for  additional
funding for roads, schools, clinics and rural development.

Human resource development is a necessary requirement for  participation  in
complex  manufacturing  processes  and  the  knowledge  economy.  Therefore,
education remains the Government's first priority, rising to  R59,5  billion
next  year.  Investment  in   education   and   skills   is   critical   for
redistribution of economic opportunities, which is necessary to address  the
inequalities and injustices of the past.

South Africans have a right to live in a safe environment. After all,  their
forebears, who drafted the Freedom Charter, laid down their  lives  for  the
attainment of a peaceful and  safe  South  Africa.  To  fight  crime,  R31,8
billion goes to the police, Justice and Correctional  Services  in  2002-03,
while R20,6 billion is allocated to Defence  and  Intelligence.  This  is  a
right the ANC will fight for and marshall all resources to attain.

The ANC has committed itself to the  creation  of  a  better  life  for  our
people.  This  Budget  is  a  concrete  reflection   of   that   commitment.
[Applause.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to follow Mr  Moloto.  May  I
congratulate him on being appointed the lead speaker from the ANC.

David Shezi stole water for his eight children  after  he  could  no  longer
take the humiliation of seeing them begging for water from neighbours.  Five
years ago, he saved enough money to  get  water  connected  to  his  hut  on
KwaZulu-Natal's South Coast, but then school fees, transport and food  costs
drove him into debt and his water was cut off.

When she could no longer bear the darkness or the  cold  that  settles  into
her  arthritic  knees  or  the  thought  of  sacrificing  another  piece  of
furniture for firewood, unemployed Agnes Mohapi of Soweto cursed the  powers
that had cut off her electricity. She then summoned a neighbourhood  service
to illegally reconnect it.

David Shezi and Agnes Mohapi are just two of millions of  people  struggling
to benefit from the roll-out of services.

In Soweto about 20 000 homes a  month  had  their  electricity  disconnected
last year for nonpayment. Sixty-one per cent of households  have  had  their
service shut off within a 12-month period.

Telkom's CEO has pointed out that while Telkom  had  now  connected  85%  of
lines, the problem is that people cannot afford it, and nearly one third  of
all  lines  installed  between  1997  and  2001   have   subsequently   been
disconnected. In the year 2000 alone, 500 000 fixed lines were  disconnected
for fraud or nonpayment.

Similar stories can, of course, be told in  respect  of  housing  and  water
provision as well. The challenge which we  face  is  to  create  sustainable
jobs and eradicate poverty so that families across our land will be able  to
afford the basic amenities which many of us take for granted.

This challenge can only be met  by  increased  savings,  more  domestic  and
foreign direct investment and substantially faster  and  sustained  economic
growth. These goals have to be achieved if we  are  to  reduce  unemployment
and poverty, but we cannot ignore the need to alleviate  poverty  now  while
the medium and long-term positive impacts of economic growth take effect.

In the short term, much more must be done to assist those who are  destitute
and without hope. For three years now, the DA has called for a basic  income
grant of about R100 per month. Poverty,  destitution  and  unemployment  are
all on the increase,  and  the  welfare  system  in  South  Africa,  as  the
Minister will tell us, is failing those most in need.

The hon the Minister of Finance has challenged us  to  explain  how  such  a
scheme would work and be sustainable. I shall now do so  by  answering  some
questions and outline a framework that the DA has in mind.

Firstly, who should qualify? Every person with  an  annual  income  of  less
than R7 500, except people already receiving a state pension  or  grant  and
personal income taxpayers, their partners and dependants.

Would a means test apply? No, it would not, but  for  income  tax  purposes,
the basic income grant will be multiplied by about 20 to ensure that  it  is
unprofitable for anyone with an income in  excess  of  R7 500  per  year  to
apply for a basic income grant.

Would the administration be difficult? Reaching large numbers,  particularly
in rural areas, is never easy, but a process linked to identity numbers  and
subsequently relayed to the SA Revenue Service could be fairly  simple.  The
biggest challenge would be  to  prevent  fraudulent  or  duplicate  payments
based on false identity documents.

How many people would qualify? One can only estimate,  but  after  excluding
the 6,3 million personal income taxpayers, their  partners  and  dependants,
individuals earning between R7 500 and R27 000 per year and the 5,5  million
people already receiving pensions or grants, one is left with  about  10  to
12 million potentially eligible people.

For budgeting purposes, one has to estimate how  many  would  apply  in  the
first year, what the percentage take-up would be in  the  medium  term,  and
how quickly successful economic policies would translate into job  creation,
resulting in people moving above the R7 500 per year  income  level  and  no
longer qualifying.

Where would the money come from? There are a number of sources  which  could
be tapped in a fiscally sound and sustainable way.  If  one  looks  at  this
year's Budget, one could have found more than would be  needed  by  using  a
mix of some or all of: one-third of the tax bonanza, which would  amount  to
R5 billion; sticking to  the  medium-term  budget  policy  statement  budget
deficit of 2,6%, which would amount to R5,4 billion; increasing VAT  by  1%,
which would give us R4,7  billion;  and  cancelling  the  second  and  third
tranches of the arms deal, which would yield more than R1 billion  per  year
in savings in interest. These sources would yield far  more  than  would  be
required for the basic income grant.

The DA believes that an appropriate basic  income  grant  is  practical  and
desirable. What is needed is  a  serious  commitment  to  implement  such  a
scheme and, in doing so, give hope to millions of South  Africans  who  have
no regular income, live in dire poverty and  are  reduced,  at  present,  to
begging, borrowing or stealing.

The Minister is able to find R80 billion to  buy  arms  without  batting  an
eyelid, while he seems determined to resist  the  introduction  of  a  basic
income grant rather than seek innovative and fiscally sound  ways  of  doing
so.

Turning to our medium- and long-term  objectives  of  economic  growth,  job
creation and poverty eradication, it is of great concern to  me  that  there
is an unwillingness to acknowledge unpalatable truths,  such  as  the  total
collapse in the value of the rand last year.

When it was R6,00 to the US dollar, Government told us  that  the  rand  was
undervalued and that the economic fundamentals were sound. It was  the  same
story when it was R8,00, R10,00 and R12,00 to the dollar.

If, as we are told, there is no logical  reason  for  the  collapse  of  the
rand, what were the illogical reasons? Or is our logic suspect? If the  rand
drops on rumours, why does it not recover fully when the rumours are  proven
to be unfounded? If, as we  are  told,  the  economic  fundamentals  are  in
place, what is it that is not in place?

Economic fundamentals such as decreased debt, budget deficits and  inflation
are essential elements and important achievements.  But  are  investors  not
also looking at low levels  of  saving,  sluggish  economic  growth,  rising
unemployment and poverty, and a fast depreciating currency?  Are  these  not
economic fundamentals as well?
Last year I made the observations that ``if there  is  a  lack  of  domestic
investment, this will deter most  foreign  investors'',  and  that  ``if  an
individual is feeling disillusioned, unhappy or insecure,  it  is  going  to
impact on  investment  decisions  that  he  or  she  makes''.  The  Minister
responded by insulting me, suggesting that I must forget about my  so-called
European past and help build Africa.

In an interview in January this year, the Director-General of  the  National
Treasury said that, and I quote:


  Domestic sentiment has been one of the prime reasons behind  the  decline
  of the rand. Unless you get domestic  investment  going,  you  are  never
  going to get foreign investment coming in.

I trust that the hon the Minister is not going to tell the  director-general
to forget about her European past and help build Africa [Interjections.]

The issue of confidence, or lack of it, is of  critical  importance  to  the
success of our economy.  All  the  economists  giving  evidence  before  the
Portfolio Committee on Finance cited lack of confidence in our economy as  a
problem. So did most, if not all, of the economists giving evidence  to  the
Myburgh commission.

The decline in Sacob's business confidence index in December  2001  was  the
third largest monthly drop since the  index  was  introduced  in  1985.  The
Bureau for Economic Research's consumer confidence index has been in  steady
decline since 1996, including black consumers.

In this House last month, the hon the Minister  of  Home  Affairs  indicated
that, and I quote: ``the harsh reality is that international perceptions  of
South Africa are now very poor'' and were  likely  to  be  ``a  contributing
factor to the downfall of our national currency''.

The Budget Review, on page 19, lists a variety of  possible  factors  behind
the rand's depreciation, but does not mention a lack of confidence in  South
Africa's economy as a contributory factor at all.  This  denial  of  reality
will not enable us to  correctly  identify  the  causes  of  low  levels  of
investment and growth. We must restore confidence in our economy if  we  are
to prosper.

Let me make two specific suggestions. Firstly, we  should  abolish  exchange
control without further delay. If Government does  not  show  confidence  in
our currency and our economy, we cannot expect others to  do  so.  Secondly,
as I requested in this debate last  year,  we  need  to  try  to  achieve  a
consensus and a unity of purpose on the way forward  in  terms  of  economic
policy. We need a new agreed strategy for investment, growth,  job  creation
and poverty eradication, which will include all stakeholders.

I am  pleased,  therefore,  to  see  that  there  is  to  be  a  growth  and
development summit and welcome the Minister's comment in the  Budget  Speech
when he said that Government alone cannot  take  responsibility  for  growth
and development. It is a collective responsibility. We need, all of  us,  to
accept that and commit to a compact that recognises that the power  to  make
a difference rests with all of us. Such a compact would need  to  address  a
key element in our economic and social landscape.  This  element,  which  is
hard to define precisely or  adequately  quantify  in  economic  models,  is
confidence.

Let us get  on  with  it.  The  Minister  should  make  sure  that  all  the
stakeholders are involved from the beginning and should not imagine  that  a
one-day-showpiece jamboree such as the  jobs  summit  will  have  a  lasting
impact.

Poverty and unemployment are on  the  increase  in  South  Africa.  Savings,
investment and growth are unsatisfactory. We need to restore the  confidence
of investors and give hope to the  destitute.  Current  government  policies
will not bring about the necessary improvements. The  DP  cannot  support  a
Budget introduced to finance more of the same. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:   The
Minister of Finance, in his Budget Speech, named  seven  priority  areas  of
delivery for the 2002 Budget. I shall, of course, focus on those areas  that
pertain  directly  to  the  Department   of   Justice   and   Constitutional
Development. In cross-referencing our department's  budget  priorities  with
those of the national Budget, I have taken the liberty of  quoting  Minister
Manuel from time to time. A little reflected glory is hard to resist.

In regard to those pertaining directly to my  department,  I  highlight  the
following: strengthening the  fight  against  crime,  improving  police  and
justice services, and enhancing administrative services for citizens.

The Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development, Dr Penuell  Maduna,
has defined the strategic framework for  the  department  for  the  upcoming
financial year and the remainder of the three-year medium-term cycle. In  so
doing, he has provided a vision,  mission  and  value  statement  that  will
guide the department's activities and undertakings for the period.

The statement is simple,  succinct  and  straightforward  and,  essentially,
these policy  directives  represent  choices  that  provide  the  focus  and
direction for the executive management of the department.

Our programme will be guided by five key messages, and I will  elaborate  on
these: Justice is a virtue, justice is for  all,  justice  is  charged  with
upholding human rights, and justice delayed is justice denied.

With regard to justice being a virtue, the  Department  of  Justice  is  the
only government portfolio named after a virtue. This tenet of ethical  merit
commands that we maintain moral excellence in all that we do.  When  dealing
with justice for all, our mission is  to  ensure  equitable  and  accessible
justice. We must give special attention to vulnerable groups such as  women,
children, the aged and the  disabled.  We  must  also  ensure  that  justice
serves the needs of those in remote rural parts of our country  as  well  as
it serves the needs of those in our cities.

In the same vein, we feel strongly that justice delayed is  justice  denied.
The department must  deliver  improved  services.  Our  civil  and  criminal
justice system must meet the needs of  court  users  in  a  manner  that  is
efficient, effective and transparent. Key areas have  been  defined  in  the
improvement  of  our  service  delivery,  and   these   include   facilities
management, management of moneys in trust, specialised services such as  the
prosecution of car  hijackers,  commercial  crime,  maintenance  defaulters,
sexual offences, domestic violence and child abuse.

In order to effect the preceding principles, justice must  be  managed.  Our
processes and practices must be effective and economic as laid down  by  the
PFMA. Accountability and improved service delivery must be the  department's
key performance indicators. Given the task at hand,  the  department  cannot
afford to carry passengers. Performance excellence must guide  every  action
of those tasked with the administration of justice, and  failure  to  comply
with these performance requirements will result in  appropriate  and  speedy
disciplinary action.

I now turn to the fact that justice is charged with upholding human  rights.
Given the luminary spirit of our Constitution - the pre-eminent law  of  the
land -  both  the  civil  and  criminal  justice  systems  must  uphold  the
principles and values  espoused  by  that  founding  document.  Accordingly,
those  tasked  with  the  administration  of  justice  have   a   particular
responsibility: They must commit themselves to a  work  ethic  and  practice
that give effect to the human rights framework that lies  at  the  heart  of
our transforming legal  system.  In  addition,  all  who  make  use  of  our
services must be assured of a transparent, fair and efficient  legal  system
that promotes and protects the rights of all court users.

In acknowledging these directives, the  department's  strategic  plan  takes
cognisance of the magnitude of the challenges related to providing the  wide
range of services associated with  the  administration  of  justice.  Within
such a wide spectrum  it  is,  of  course,  necessary  to  prioritise.  This
overview of the strategic plan seeks to highlight the plan's most  important
components and to evaluate these against the  strategic  objectives  of  the
national Budget and broader Government policy.

To meet the principle imperatives underlining the national Budget, the  core
performance areas which, in the department's view, must be  prioritised  for
improved  service  delivery  are:  developing   appropriate   policies   and
procedures for the recruitment  and,  most  importantly,  the  retention  of
highly skilled officials; improving  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of
prosecution and adjudication of criminal  and  civil  trials;  upgrading  50
major  court  complexes  and  the  procurement  and  erection  of   26   new
facilities; meeting the legal needs of  vulnerable  groups  such  as  women,
children, the aged and the disabled through  the  provision  of  specialised
services; developing appropriate IT systems  for  capturing  and  processing
data on transactions within the maintenance  system  and  Master's  Offices,
thereby appropriately managing the trust account moneys that  are  essential
to these units; using improved  crime  intelligence  mechanisms  within  the
Scorpions unit to prosecute criminals and  syndicates;  the  development  of
modern systems for the effective management and tracking  of  cases  through
courts; and ensuring that the resources are  distributed  according  to  the
needs of the users and recipients of the department's services.

These performance areas are prioritised because of the  enormous  importance
Government and the department attach to the fight against crime,  the  vital
role the maintenance system plays in the  alleviation  of  poverty  and  the
support of children, and the need to ensure that moneys  held  in  trust  by
the masters are secured and efficiently handled.

Perhaps  hon  members  will  allow  me  an  aside  here.  Nowhere   is   the
Government's determination to  succeed  in  the  fight  against  crime  made
clearer than in the new Budget. Amongst other items, our Minister  indicated
that an additional 16 000 policemen and policewomen will be provided in  the
current budget, and, of course, this itself leads to the  need  for  greater
effort and expenditure throughout the cluster - from  Safety  and  Security,
through Justice to the Correctional Services.

If we are to meet the  national  Budget  expectations  of  improved  service
delivery and strengthening the fight against crime, the  JCPS  cluster  must
work in an integrated and co-ordinated fashion.  This  is,  of  course,  not
new. But we must continue to improve the flow of work  in  and  between  the
participating departments in  such  a  way  that  it  genuinely  provides  a
seamless service delivery process. This seamless  experience  must  be  true
from the time that a crime is reported, through prosecution  and  ultimately
to conviction and sentencing.

The Integrated Justice System task team has been created to give impetus  to
this process. In this regard, the IJS Court Centre Project  aims  to  reduce
the average case cycle time by managing court rolls, tracing  cases  through
the system and  controlling  the  awaiting-trial  period  of  each  detained
accused.

The second IJS initiative, the Court Process Project, is  our  flagship  and
provides for the automation of  both  civil  and  criminal  court  and  case
management. The pilot project initiated  at  both  Johannesburg  and  Durban
effectively allows for a criminal case to  be  managed  electronically  from
the SA Police Service, through prosecution to adjudication.  It  allows  for
the necessary interaction with both the  Department  of  Social  Development
and that of Correctional Services.

We have proven the system's functionality  in  real-life  application.  This
pilot project is due to be concluded  at  the  end  of  this  month  and  is
scheduled for enhancement and rollout to further sites later  this  year.  I
would like members to note that this system is  a  world  first  in  justice
ICT. We should heartily congratulate all those involved.

The department's contribution to these initiatives comes  under  the  banner
of our e-justice programme. Aside from the  CCP,  there  are  other  equally
dramatic developments scheduled for delivery this  year.  They  include  the
digital nervous system, a project  which  is  designed  to  provide  11  300
officials  of  the  department   with   electronic   infrastructure,   total
connectivity including Internet access and intranet and court training  over
a period of two years. Thus far  we  have  delivered  and  implemented  this
project at 45 sites and have a further 60 sites scheduled for delivery  over
the next six months. In total we have provided 3  500  officials  with  this
infrastructure and plan to extend this to a further 3 000  over  the  coming
period.
The  Guardian  Fund's  Digital  Management  Project,  which  addresses   the
financial administration of estates, has been developed and will be  piloted
in Kimberley in April this year. The project is  scheduled  for  rollout  to
all masters' offices during the course of the year and we  are  particularly
pleased to address this area, which has been a problem cited in  several  of
the Auditor-General's reports.

The IJS Court Centre Project is an  outstanding  example  of  an  integrated
approach to project implementation and speaks to the heart of  the  national
Budget's  call  for  improved  service   delivery.   Appropriate   diversion
mechanisms for cases that can be  dealt  with  through  alternative  dispute
resolution  mechanisms  are  currently  being   explored.   This   and   the
implementation of the recently promulgated  plea-bargaining  legislation  is
expected to have an exceedingly positive impact on the numbers of  awaiting-
trial prisoners and therefore on the budget of  Correctional  Services.  The
initiative to reduce case backlogs with the  introduction  of  Saturday  and
additional courts has been extremely successful, with  a  total  of  17  232
cases being finalised by February this year.

I wish now to turn to a subject that has been causing deep  concern  to  the
Government and the public alike.  The  prevalence  of  sexual  violence  and
child abuse in our society has necessitated the expansion  of  the  existing
20 sexual offences courts to 30 such centres during the  upcoming  year.  In
terms of strengthening the fight against  crime,  the  deterrent  effect  of
appropriately harsh sentencing for crimes against the women and children  of
this country cannot be overstated. In this regard I would like to point  out
that our courts handed down no less  than  97  life  sentences  for  violent
crimes against children last year. Perhaps if more people knew  about  these
sentences the tide would turn.

Preliminary research at our Thuthuzela project has  shown  that  when  women
are provided with a supportive,  survivor-centred  court  environment,  they
are  more  willing  to  stay  the  distance  and  see  matters  through   to
prosecution. We will continue to refine our protocol, upgrade the skills  of
the  specialist  teams  dealing  with  rape  and   expand   the   customised
infrastructure required for such programmes. The participating  departments,
Health, Justice and Social Development, are currently seeking ways  to  roll
out similar centres to other provinces.
As Justice improves and refines  its  management  information  systems,  the
Ministry is firmly in favour of providing gender analyses of our budget  and
actual expenditure. We hope that this will be achieved  before  March  2004.
We would then be reinforcing  our  Government's  commitment  at  Beijing  to
incorporate a gender perspective into the design, development, adoption  and
execution of all budgetary processes in our department.

Promoting  equitable,  effective  and  appropriate  resource  allocation  to
support gender equality and to enhance women's empowerment  not  only  meets
the imperatives of our Constitution, it makes good  financial  and  economic
sense. Indeed Noeleen Heyzer, in her recent statement to the UN  Development
Fund for Women, UNIFEM, said:


  A financial architecture that promotes the progress  of  women  will  not
  just promote gender equality; it will  also  promote  poverty  reduction,
  human development and the realisation of human rights.

In summing up the department's plans for the effective and efficient use  of
the financial resources made available to us, I can do  no  better  than  to
quote once again from the Minister of Finance's Budget speech.  He  said  in
his preamble:


  We know that the society to which we aspire - compassionate,  democratic,
  egalitarian - will not come about by belief alone. It  is  a  society  we
  seek to create.

We will continue to invite the public  to  support  and  to  participate  in
Letsima programmes in and around our courts. In this and in the  way  we  do
our work, I hope it will become clear that the  Department  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development is entirely focused on maximising the  speed  and
efficiency through which our  contribution  can  help  to  deliver  a  truly
compassionate, democratic and egalitarian society.

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, special congratulations to Dr  Trevor  Manuel.
He is a very deserving recipient of this honour.

Today I have also found myself  a  few  times  in  agreement  with  the  hon
Andrew. Maybe it is because he is now  wearing  a  different  hat  from  the
finance section. The Minister and the Department of Finance  must  again  be
congratulated on the presentation of a  well-constructed  and  user-friendly
Budget Speech.

The financial policy, the fiscal discipline, the narrowing of the margin  of
the deficit before borrowing and the social commitment  must  be  applauded.
Inkatha welcomes the relief for the poor and the indigent and,  although  it
is  not  happening  now,  in  future  attention  should  be  given  to   the
introduction of a basic income  grant.  The  Minister,  of  course,  had  an
excellent window of opportunity due to the substantial surplus  income  from
taxation. The IFP's congratulatory comments must therefore  be  shared  with
the SA Revenue Service.

The higher inflation increases in social pensions and  income  grants  could
have been expected. However, with the extra windfall  from  the  SA  Revenue
Service, the IFP believes more could have been done.

Income relief for particularly the lower and middle income earners will  put
more food on the table. The IFP would also  like  to  have  a  much  greater
increase in the tax exemption on savings or the taxation should at least  be
on par with the taxation on dividends. The IFP would have put more  emphasis
on the creation of employment  and  stimulation  of  economic  growth.  More
could have been done to encourage tourism to South  Africa  whilst  the  new
approach is needed to stimulate agriculture and particularly  the  formation
of integrated farming units. In this regard, we would have welcomed a  clear
sectoral approach  where  incentives  for  these  sectors  could  have  been
spelled out.

HIV/Aids is a national emergency  with  catastrophic  consequences  for  the
economy. Training and practical education programmes for HIV/Aids  could  be
financed from the  vast  untaxed  skills  levy  fund  and  particularly  the
training of health workers and volunteers assisting  with  the  roll-out  of
nevirapine to HIV-positive pregnant mothers could have been considered.

All the fundamentals are, however, in place, and South Africa should be  set
for growth. The president of the IFP, the hon Dr M G Buthelezi, has  praised
the Minister, calling him the best Minister of  Finance  that  this  country
has ever had, or even the  best  Minister  of  Finance  in  the  world.  The
question Dr Buthelezi posed, however, is the crucial one that we  must  find
answers to. If all the  fundamentals  are  in  place  and  if  we  have  the
blessing and co-operation of both the Western  and  the  Eastern  countries,
why is our economic growth so slow?

South Africa is further  blessed  with  an  excellent  Governor  and  Deputy
Governor of the Reserve Bank. The Governor received an award as the  Central
Banker of the year in October 2001. I put a question to the Governor of  the
Reserve Bank after congratulating Mr Mboweni on achieving  the  upper  level
of the inflation targeting. My question to the governor  was:  What  is  the
worse evil for  South  Africa,  an  annual  inflation  rate  of  10%  and  a
devaluation in the rand of 10% or an inflation rate of 6% and a  devaluation
in the rand of 20%?

Crucial to my question would be whether we can afford to sacrifice  economic
growth and the wiping out of our  international  wealth  when  our  currency
goes into free fall.  Yes,  when  the  rand  went  into  free  fall  it  was
necessary for Government to interfere in the financial markets.

We, in the IFP, can also understand the reasoning behind the raising of  the
repo rate, and thereby the increasing of  interest  rates  on  the  volatile
short-term money markets. What the IFP, however, cannot understand  is  why,
in  the  process,  South  Africa  must  punish  the  long-term  lenders  and
particularly borrowers with mortgage bonds. The Minister, at the same  time,
tarred with the same brush the unruly speculators and the hard-pressed  home
owners of the country. In my mind, it is possible to  differentiate  between
long-term interest rates and the short to medium-term  factors.  Again,  why
must the innocent home owners or long-term lenders be  punished  because  of
the misbehaviour and speculative nature of the short-term lenders and money-
market speculators?

If the Minister cannot find an administrative way  of  separating  long-term
interest factors from the short-term money market factors, there  are  other
ways in which this  can  be  done.  One  way  would  be  for  Government  to
subsidise  long-term  housing  by  the  equivalent  of  the  relevant   rate
increase. Should the cost factor  be  too  high  for  Government,  then  the
increased portion of the interest rate on the  short-term  factor  could  be
treated as a penalty or form of taxation in order to  supply  the  necessary
funding for the required subsidisation of the long-term bonds.

What is the message that we are sending  to  business  development  when  we
increase interest rates, and how do business entrepreneurs  interpret  these
increases? Entrepreneurs and industrialists still clearly  remember  that  a
few years ago interest rates  escalated  to  over  20%  with  a  devastating
effect on their capital repayments. One must  imagine  them  competing  with
American, European  and  Japanese  institutions  with  a  comparative  prime
interest rate below 6% and with almost zero devaluation in currency value.

With  the  tendency  during  2001  of  gradually  lowering  interest  rates,
entrepreneurs and home owners gave a sigh of relief, only to  be  kicked  in
the teeth again by the recent increase in the repo  rate  in  January  2002,
followed by similar increases in bank interest  rates.  Now  it  would  seem
that a further interest rate hike is apparently unavoidable.  We  know  that
the Governor of the Reserve Bank will probably announce today  another  hike
in interest rates.

There, I would like to say to the Minister, is the  fear  of  the  realities
that are dawning on us. What South Africa and investors need is  good  news.
And we desperately need a positive spin in this country. Business and  long-
term  lenders'  greatest  apprehension  is  that  their  long-term   capital
commitments will be negatively affected with another spate of interest  rate
increases.

I  sincerely  consider  higher  interest   rates,   higher   inflation   and
particularly the devaluation of the rand  as  a  motion  of  no  confidence,
unfortunately in the Minister and in our country. I would  like  to  say  to
the Minister that something must be done  to  create  hope  and  a  positive
investment environment out here.

My leader clearly indicated the negative factors and perceptions that  South
Africa must overcome in order to  stimulate  foreign  direct  investment  in
South Africa. Featuring primarily in this regard is that we must break  away
from the negative perceptions that South Africa  is  just  another  unstable
African state. Unfortunately, our silent diplomacy foreign  policy  position
on Zimbabwe has  not  reversed  these  perceptions.  In  fact,  the  present
situation has even contributed to  the  totally  wrong  perception  that  it
could just be a matter of time before South Africa slips  into  a  situation
similar to Zimbabwe. We, of course, disagree with these perceptions.

With regard to the election outcome in Zimbabwe, we in the  IFP  are  highly
critical about the actions of the governing  party  in  the  run-up  to  the
elections as well as during the physical voting process.

The attention of the world has been focused on Africa during  the  past  few
weeks, and the establishment of the  African  Union  is  very  much  on  the
forefront.

The IFP fully supports the Nepad initiative and the  ideals  of  an  African
Union. Yes, we must be an integral part of a major trade bloc  and  even  an
African Union government. However, we must ensure that our  country  belongs
in the camp of countries which are genuinely committed to democracy  and  to
the blessing of development, progress and prosperity, which come only  in  a
genuinely open and free society. We cannot hesitate or falter when it  comes
to drawing a distinction between those African  countries  which  are  truly
democratic and those which are not.

We have noticed with interest the aspirations  of  the  African  Union,  and
particularly the future introduction of a single African  currency  for  all
African states. Theoretically, this is a great  idea.  If  there  can  be  a
single European currency, that is the euro, then surely  we  in  Africa  can
also have an African or Afro dollar, or even an African  Elephant  currency.
The death knell, however, would  be  if  that  currency  were  not  strictly
controlled  by  a  single,  trustworthy  central  bank.  Perhaps  with   the
excellent relationship with and commitment of the West to the upliftment  of
Africa, my personal suggestion would be that the African  dollar  should  be
issued by the European Central Bank, or at an equivalent value and  directly
linked to the euro.

Although the  IFP  is  comfortable  with  the  appointment  of  the  Myburgh
commission of inquiry into the fall of the rand, we believe that in the  end
it will just be an expensive lesson into the reality of  how  market  forces
operate.

South Africans  tend  to  be  critical  and  judgmental  of  those  disloyal
citizens that are sending their moneys out of the country. Let us,  however,
look at the reality. For more than 20 years now the rand has declined  on  a
constant basis.  The  value  of  the  rand  against  the  dollar  and  other
currencies shows a single downward trend. If the rand had traded as a  share
on the stock exchange, one can think for oneself what  could  have  happened
to that share. If it were not delisted, the shareholders would  try  to  get
rid of it timeously.

The same types of jitters, indeed, occurred in December 2001, when the  rand
slipped proportionately much more than the declining  graph,  and  then  one
saw a run on the  money  reserves.  People  were  panicking  and  trying  to
safeguard at least some of their savings and hard work over the past  years.
The SA Reserve  Bank,  just  like  any  other  banking  institution,  cannot
withstand such  a  run  on  their  reserves  and  on  our  money,  and  then
automatically the money depreciates more than substantially.

What are our alternatives? How  are  we  going  to  stop  the  rot?  Several
options are open, and these can be investigated and  researched.  Government
does have the capacity to research the phenomenon and even our  universities
could look into alternatives and models. Of course,  we  in  the  IFP  would
like to get involved, but we simply do not have the research  capacity.  The
IFP, despite  our  misgivings  about  the  political  influence  of  outside
factors on our economy, will nevertheless vote for this Budget.

Ms C M P RAMOTSAMAI:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  I  want  to  focus  my
contribution to this debate on our struggle against poverty. The  President,
in his state of the nation address, called on all of us to work together  to
push back the frontiers of poverty.

The President also reminded us to look at what we could do for  our  country
when he raised the principle of Vukuzenzele. But these calls are not new  to
ANC members. In fact, we have repeated, since 1994,  that  our  struggle  is
not over, but is now against poverty. Although some  members  on  the  other
side of the House have recently jumped on the  bandwagon,  our  approach  to
poverty has been consistent and systematic.

Our single biggest contribution to the relief of poverty is in the  form  of
direct cash transfer. We  pay  social  grants  to  more  than  four  million
beneficiaries every month. This is a direct transfer of nearly  R18  billion
into the homes of the poorest of our people. The amount is still growing  as
we strive to ensure that we  reach  the  target  of  three  million  of  the
poorest children through the child support grant.

The old age grant and disability grant increase from R570 per month to  R620
per month, while the child support increases from R110  to  R130,  and  this
increase is above the level of the inflation rate. We welcome  the  increase
awarded to the social grants and we welcome the fact that the date on  which
this increase takes effect has been brought forward to 1 April 2002.

However, it is critical that we make sure that the  transfer  system  works,
and that different Government departments that  have  to  work  together  to
ensure  access  make  every  effort  to  ensure  that   blockages   in   the
registration  of  beneficiaries  and  issuing  of  identity  documents   are
eliminated. The same  goes  for  the  assessment  panels  that  must  assist
disabled persons to get their grants.

With regard to the many of our people who have been turned away from  social
services offices with a ``no'' answer, meaning that there is  no  grant,  we
must expose those officials that take these benefits for themselves  through
laziness and corruption. The message must be clear:  we  will  not  tolerate
their getting away with this at the  expense  of  those  entitled  to  these
benefits. When these people have been exposed, Government must  take  action
instead of allowing these civil servants to stay in jobs indefinitely.

The Government appointed a committee of inquiry into a comprehensive  social
security system in February  2000.  This  committee's  report  is  currently
before the Cabinet. Perhaps we need to put the work of  the  committee  into
perspective, as there seems  to  be  a  particular  focus  on  one  possible
outcome of the committee's deliberations.

When it was set up, it had  the  task  to  investigate  a  national  pension
system, old age protection, the social assistance  grant,  and  unemployment
insurance, as well as health funding  and  insurance.  The  outcome  of  the
report can therefore not  be  singularly  focused  as  many  would  suggest.
However, we do look forward to the report making a significant  contribution
to our ability to advance from a fragmented and unsustainable system to  one
where, through solidarity with one another as a society, we can establish  a
system with a social safety net that catches all those  who  are  unable  to
support themselves.

We also note the allocation in the Budget  that  is  aimed  specifically  at
improving the administration of grants. The  most  important  here  are  the
introduction of norms and standards for  the  delivery  of  social  security
services, as well as the replacement of the Socpen  system.  We  trust  that
the department will be able to meet its target so that we  can  ensure  that
beneficiaries who are entitled to grants are not  disadvantaged  because  of
administrative inefficiency.

The other significant part of the fight against poverty within the field  of
social development is a special allocation for poverty relief. We know  that
the total amount of  R1,5  billion  has  been  allocated  to  12  Government
departments, with  the  Department  of  Social  Development  receiving  R100
million in its financial year.

We all know that we have come a long way from an  allocation  of  this  kind
where projects in  the  provincial  departments  did  not  always  have  the
capacity to apply money they received. As Government we did the  responsible
thing, which was to go back to the project to see what was working and  what
was not.

The allocation to the Department of Social Development was  reduced  to  R50
million so as to ensure that these funds could be managed well, and that  we
avoided the spending pressures of the past years.

The Department of Social Development has indicated that 30% of the  projects
that will receive funding form part of the nodal points  in  the  integrated
rural development strategy. This is to encourage and  urge  hon  members  to
ensure that they know where these  nodal  points  are,  and  to  follow  the
progress of projects supported by the Department of Social Development.

What is also  encouraging  is  that  for  the  first  time  the  concept  of
fostering longer-term sustainability and  independence  from  these  special
allocations, by way of  improving  access  to  microfinance,  is  now  being
introduced. A total of 20% of projects will be targeted for  this  programme
and we would be keen to revisit the issue six months from now  to  establish
to what extent the department has succeeded in meeting this target.

Let me now turn to the  department's  role  in  empowering  communities  and
individuals to cope with the devastating effects of and the  impact  of  HIV
and Aids. We have made a clear decision in favour  of  supporting  community
initiatives for the  care  and  the  support  of  individuals  affected  and
infected by HIV and Aids. The allocation to this  department  has  increased
significantly, this  year,  from  R12,5  million  to  R46,5  million,  which
suggests  that  the  capacity  to  assess  projects  and  provide  immediate
assistance has since increased significantly. In fact, the  funds  allocated
will go to a minimum of 300 projects nationwide, many of which  are  run  by
voluntary organisations and faith-based institutions.

We would like to encourage such organisations to continue  with  their  work
and call on the Department of Social Development to do  everything  possible
to  ensure  that  the  partnerships  that  these  projects   represent   are
strengthened. Without such partnership community development work  will  not
advance, and therefore we must support the social accord between  Government
and civil society.

Many of the  organisations  have  repeatedly  noted  that  they  have  great
difficulty in accessing sufficient funds for  their  work.  We  commend  the
spirit of volunteerism which sustains such organisations.  This  also  means
that, as Government, we must also do our part to  ensure  that  the  funding
system functions well.

Last year the Treasury announced that a range of public benefit  activities,
for which donors can receive tax  rebates,  had  been  broadened.  This  now
includes nonprofit organisations which provide services  in  the  fields  of
care for the older person, HIV and education.  This  form  of  strengthening
the volunteer sector must be welcomed.  We  encourage  all  stakeholders  to
continue in the process of discussion with the Treasury and Sars  to  ensure
that the list of activities is fully representative of  the  public  benefit
activities that are so crucial to the development of our people.

The Budget is clearly focused on developing our people's  ability  to  reach
their full potential. We have learnt from our difficulties in the  past  and
we have put into place measures to improve the service  we  deliver  to  our
people.

Let us not allow anyone to say that we do not care about the  poor.  Let  us
rather encourage each other in the spirit of Vukuzenzele  to  work  together
and push back the frontiers of poverty. [Applause.]
Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, since the early 1990s there has  been
a great deal of talk about the  need  for  a  real  national  consensus.  In
effect, we all agree on the need to agree, but it seems as though  we  never
really get to the point.

On what precisely do we need  consensus?  The  answer,  above  all,  is  the
importance of human dignity. The huge  challenge  facing  our  country  must
give us pause. The work ahead of us, if we are going to give meaning to  our
agreement on the importance of human dignity, is not the work of  a  day,  a
year or even five years. Ours is the work of a decade. The  measure  of  our
success will be if, at the end of this decade, we can confidently  say  that
all our people have dignity to match the excellence of their spirit.

The first step toward building human dignity is to  heal  the  divisions  of
the past and establish a society based on democratic values, social  justice
and fundamental human rights. Contrary to what some  believe,  this  process
is far from over.

The second phase is to improve the quality of life of all our  citizens  and
free the potential of each person. This Budget is the  strongest  indication
yet that we are achieving the right balance between  the  responsibility  of
Government and freeing the potential of their people. It is  a  Budget  that
takes forward the process of building human dignity  and  encourages  people
to increasingly accept personal responsibility.

A vital element in building human dignity is the equality of all people.  In
a country such as ours, this means a  deeper  understanding  of  reconciling
the interests of the majority and the minorities. These interests should  be
taken out of their competitive context. It is possible for the interests  of
the  majority  and  the  minorities  to  complement  each  other.   Minority
communities have a responsibility to be part  of  the  building  process  in
South Africa. Majority communities have the responsibility to let them be  a
significant part of that process.

This is what the majority and the minority in Zimbabwe  denied  each  other.
In South Africa there is enough goodwill and commitment to avert that.  That
is exactly what we are busy achieving in this country.

Building a nonracial society, where we can nurture this mutual  respect,  is
not  a  simple  theoretical  exercise;   it   requires   ongoing   practical
initiatives. In this regard, I have to commend former President Mandela  for
unveiling the Danie Theron statue in Pretoria at  the  Voortrekker  Monument
last week.

Danie Theron is a heroic figure in the Afrikaans community and its  struggle
against colonialism. President Mandela's action touched a  deep  core  which
words alone could not have achieved. It is this generosity of  spirit  which
contributes the vital energy necessary to build a  united  nation  of  which
mutual respect and accommodation of all communities are the hallmarks.

Like  the  majority,  many  minority  communities  have   also   experienced
indignity and therefore know how important human  dignity  is.  It  is  much
more important than just rands and cents. During  the  Anglo-Boer  War,  the
prevailing sentiment taught Afrikaners  was:  ``These  country  boers  could
never be an asset to the British. They  are  uncivilised  Afrikaner  savages
with a thin white veneer, savages produced by generations of lonely life  on
the veld. Their expulsion would make room for decent British settlers.''

Next month will see the return of the remains of Saartjie Baartman, who  has
become for many a symbol of the denial and the violation  of  human  dignity
of  people  during  colonial  times.  Many  people  do  not  appreciate  the
emotional significance of her return. French scientists  considered  her  to
be, ``the lowest form of humanity and the highest form  of  animal  life,  a
kind of preDarwinist missing link.'' Innocence was perceived  as  barbarism,
lack of education was seen as  stupidity  and  difference  was  labelled  as
subhumanity.

Dr Verwoerd's Bantu education policy encapsulated  the  violation  of  human
dignity. He wanted to condemn people on the basis  of  skin  colour  to  the
permanent status of hewers of wood and drawers of water when he said:


  The school must equip the Bantu to meet the demands which  economic  life
  will impose on him. What is the use of teaching a Bantu child mathematics
  when it cannot use it in practice?

The fact that we share this historic experience  of  the  violation  of  our
human dignity must  make  the  building  of  human  dignity  our  first  and
foremost national goal. But we need more than this; we also need  to  unlock
the expertise and skills of the minority  communities  in  this  country  to
contribute to a better life for the nation as a whole. The fact is that  the
privileged education which only a part of our nation was privy to should  be
seen as an underutilised resource that must now be fully  utilised  for  the
benefit of all. The willingness is there.

In this regard, black economic empowerment is a vital  element  in  building
human  dignity.  Many  people  feel  threatened  by  it,  but  if   executed
correctly, empowerment is not at  the  expense  of  any  group  but  to  the
benefit of all.

Communities who went through this process before,  like  the  Afrikaans  and
Indian communities, have a lot to offer in terms of  what  worked  and  what
did not work. Black economic empowerment is often  criticised  as  being  to
the benefit of only the few. Although some of this criticism may  be  valid,
the creation of role models  is  essential  to  kick-start  the  process  of
empowerment.

The building and support of human dignity is a universal imperative. If  we,
as South Africans, work tirelessly  to  nurture  human  dignity  within  our
borders but turn our  backs  on  the  inhumane  treatment  of  our  regional
neighbours, we achieve nothing. The situation in Zimbabwe is the  embodiment
of this principle.

The people of Zimbabwe have been intimidated, repressed  and  victimised  by
agents of their own government. It is our duty, not just as fellow  Africans
and neighbours, but also as fellow men and women, to do  everything  in  our
power to assist in the  restoration  of  human  dignity  to  the  people  of
Zimbabwe. We cannot allow  any  individual  to  trample  that  dignity  with
impunity.

In a very significant development, only a few hours before this debate,  the
Nigerian head of the Commonwealth mission and  former  head  of  the  state,
Abdulsalami Abubakar, announced that the Zimbabwean election was  held  ``in
a climate of fear, which did not adequately allow free and  fair  expression
of the will of the electorate''. This  forthright  opinion  gives  new  hope
that institutions which have thus far been hesitant  to  criticise  are  now
willing to stand up and be counted.
It is easy to denounce the election results and process  in  Zimbabwe.  But,
unlike many other countries  with  whom  we  agree  about  the  undemocratic
behaviour of Mr Mugabe, we in  South  Africa  do  not  have  the  luxury  of
closing our hearts, our minds  or  our  conscience  to  the  plight  of  our
Zimbabwean neighbours.

South Africa has carefully built the image that a new generation of  leaders
with a commitment to democratic  ideals  is  going  to  change  the  African
continent. Siding with President Mugabe, creating  the  impression  that  we
defend his erosion of free and fair elections,  will  seriously  damage  our
carefully built-up credibility. Our economy will pay  the  price.  Stability
in our region will pay the price.  Our  credibility  in  being  one  of  the
guardians of the African  Renaissance,  and  of  democratic  ideals  on  our
continent, will certainly pay the price.

Although not the ideal solution, the African solution  of  a  government  of
national unity in circumstances  such  as  these  may  move  the  Zimbabwean
situation forward. It will lock the two  main  parties  into  a  process  of
accepting coresponsibility for stability in their own country.  It  has  the
potential to convince the international community that there is a  way  out,
and it will enable Zimbabweans themselves to start  addressing  the  massive
developmental challenges which, above  all,  require  a  consensus-  seeking
government.

In conclusion, let us consolidate our gains since 1994. Let us build on  our
credentials as a country where democratic ideals are  not  merely  words  on
paper. Let us proceed with the process to enable  our  citizens  to  cherish
their freedom and to accept the responsibility of using their  opportunities
to underscore, to expand and to entrench real human dignity  for  all  South
Africans. [Applause.]

Mr N M NENE: Madam Speaker, hon members, let me start by congratulating  our
hon Minister of Finance on his commendable and well-deserved achievement.  A
simple  explanation  of  expansionary  fiscal  policy  is  an  increase   in
expenditure both in Government and consumer spending,  increased  investment
spending and a reduction in  taxes.  This  is  precisely  what  this  Budget
achieves. One commentator made the observation of how difficult  it  is  for
opposition parties to find fault with the Budget because they have  to  look
outside of it to find ammunition to fight back.
When the Minister of Finance, the hon Dr Trevor Manuel,  tabled  the  Budget
last month and later the Division of Revenue Bill, our communities  realised
that we do what we preach in the ANC. The Minister put it  quite  eloquently
when he said: ``Indlala igwetshiwe'' [Poverty has been eradicated.]  Indeed,
the frontiers of poverty are threatened  by  this  expansionary  Budget.  An
increase in  local  government  allocation  to  strengthen  basic  municipal
services provision to  poor  households  is  clear  evidence  of  this  and,
therefore, the example that Mr Ken Andrew made no longer exists.

This is also meant to help the  municipalities  to  manage  the  demarcation
processes, the institutional restructuring of service delivery  systems  and
to provide free basic services to address precisely what Mr Ken  Andrew  was
complaining about. And,  I  was  very  surprised  to  hear  the  hon  member
condoning theft, all in the name of trying to  push  for  the  basic  income
grant.

The provincial sphere of government also  benefits  tremendously  from  this
expansion in spending, all directed at reinforcing the accelerated  pro-poor
programmes. We acknowledge that, due to the  magnitude  of  the  problem  of
poverty, it is not easy to meet the expectations of our  people.  Hence  the
President's call for Vukuzenzele and Letsema becomes  very  relevant  as  it
affords all of us an opportunity to appreciate the size of the  problem  and
to collectively declare war on it.

The challenge facing us as elected representatives of our people is that  of
mobilising all motive forces to take full charge  of  the  struggle  against
poverty.  In  the  Minister's  words,  the   most   important   contribution
Government made to long-term growth and  development  is  investing  in  its
people. The Learnership Programme  and  the  Skills  Development  Programme,
through the Umsobomvu Fund, are among the  key  development  strategies  for
human development.

In order to enhance small business development,  some  tax  relief  measures
are proposed and some of them have been mentioned by the previous  speakers:
an increase in the threshold from R100 000  to  R150 000  for  the  15%  tax
rate, an increase in the threshold from R1 million to  R3  million  turnover
for small business relief and also that the tax  administration  burden  has
been simplified and reduced in order to reduce compliance costs.

Our advances in pursuit of a better life for all are meant  to  enhance  the
dignity of all our people and  to  liberate  them  from  poverty  and  human
deprivation. The Freedom Charter says:  ``The  people  shall  share  in  the
country's wealth.'' In order to realise  this  dream,  we  need  to  wage  a
sustained struggle on many fronts. We must ensure  that  our  economy  grows
and develops. It must provide the material  base  that  will  enable  us  to
defeat the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment. It  must  create  the
jobs without which it will be impossible to defeat the scourge  of  poverty.
Thus, we have to focus on the twin tasks of growth and equity.

Our society continues  to  be  plagued  by  racial,  gender  and  geographic
disparities that still exist in  the  distribution  of  wealth,  income  and
opportunity. These disparities are themselves a fetter  on  the  growth  and
expansion of the economy and the wealth in our society.

We should encourage the emerging black businesspeople  to  communicate  with
their established counterparts to extend  their  contracts  and  interaction
with the rest of the region and our continent as a whole. In  terms  of  job
creation, it is critical that we use the  opportunities  created  by,  among
other things, the transformation that is taking place in the  Department  of
Trade and Industry, the rural-urban renewal  programmes,  and  the  recently
adopted strategy on agriculture. This strategy  needs  to  be  pursued  with
vigour in order to address  the  issues  of  land,  food  security  and  job
creation. This will include support to the new black farmers to ensure  that
they have the means to carry out their productive activities successfully.

Thina-ke njenge-ANC indlala nobuphofu akusilo nje ibhola  lepolitiki,  kepha
thina uqobo lwethu siphuma  kuyo  le  miphakathi  edla  imbuya  ngothi  kube
kukhona abadla izambane likapondo ngoba  babevunwa  ubandlululo  esikhathini
esingaphambili.

UHulumeni  we-ANC  ujube  ikhomishini  ukuthi   icubungule   ngesimo   sonke
sezenhlalakahle  ukuze  kutholakale  isixazululo  esiphelele   kulesi   simo
sobumpofu. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[We, as the ANC, do not regard poverty as a political football,  because  we
ourselves come from these communities, which were poor,  while  others  were
living well because they were supported by apartheid in the past.
The ANC Government has appointed a commission to investigate  the  whole  of
social welfare in order to find solutions to poverty.]

This means that we must ensure that these  masses  have  access  to  houses,
clean water, sanitation, electricity, health facilities  telecommunications,
roads,  affordable  and  efficient  public  transport   and   other   social
infrastructure to end the situation of underdevelopment and to  improve  the
social and economic wellbeing of our people.

National Treasury has recently released  its  strategic  plan  for  2002-05,
where its mission and objectives are amplified, the  first  of  these  being
the advancement  of  economic  growth  and  income  redistribution.  In  the
Minister's statement of policy and commitment, he reaffirms  his  commitment
to  setting  and  enforcing  high  standards  and  making  Government   more
accountable and transparent.

It is our belief in the ANC that our achievements in the past were based  on
solid and tested principles and  policies  with  which,  together  with  the
masses of this country, we will continue to chart the way forward  with  the
rest following us to victory. [Applause.]
Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker and hon members, the  UDM  remains  convinced
that job creation is the single biggest challenge facing  this  country.  If
we can succeed in rising above this challenge, then South Africa  can  truly
become a winning nation which provides a decent and fulfilling life  to  its
citizens. In the final analysis, the needs of every South African flow  from
the need for a decent job.

The UDM is dismayed that the Appropriation  Bill  reflects  no  co-ordinated
national strategy on the part of the Government  to  create  jobs.  We  have
said this before: Government must intervene responsibly in  the  economy  to
create jobs and encourage  domestic-led  business  growth.  It  is,  despite
claims  to  the  contrary,  a  realistic  and  viable  option  practised  by
governments across the world.

The very same countries that this Government is too eager  to  please,  with
its self-imposed structural adjustment package,  are  not  blindly  pursuing
such policies. When American factory workers or European farmers face large-
scale unemployment, those  countries  intervene.  They  do  not  tell  their
workers, ``The market has spoken; you are now redundant.'' No,  they  invest
billions in subsidies, skills training and business development.
Underspending at national  Government  level  continues,  while  it  accuses
provincial governments of this transgression. In fact, it appears  that  the
kettle and the pot are  equally  black.  Again,  we  have  to  question  the
commitment of Government; R3,48 billion of the  national  Government  Budget
went unspent in the 2000-01 financial year - about R1,7 billion on both  the
recurrent and the capital side of the Budget.

It is truly disturbing that the national  departments  that  can  contribute
significantly  to  job  creation  and  infrastructure  development  are  the
biggest offenders. The Department of Public Works contributed almost 21%  to
the total underspend due to large underspending on its capital  budget,  and
the Department of  Labour  contributed  14%  due  to  underspending  on  the
recurrent side.

Corruption continues to blight all efforts at addressing the needs of  South
Africans and undermines Government spending, as envisaged in this Bill.

In his state of the nation address, as in  all  previous  addresses  at  the
opening of Parliament, the President  declared  his  commitment  to  rolling
back the frontiers of poverty. Poverty alleviation among the poor  has  been
his refrain in his opening addresses.

One would not believe this is the same President who  previously  chaired  a
Cabinet committee which awarded arms  procurement  tenders,  in  clandestine
circumstances, to offshore companies which, to  date,  will  cost  taxpayers
between R52 billion and R66 billion. Notwithstanding  the  findings  of  the
investigating agencies, which exonerated the executive from any  wrongdoing,
a dark shadow of doubt hovers over the  handling  of  the  arms  procurement
deal.

During 2000, I tabled in Scopa a report revealing  unauthorised  expenditure
amounting to R8 million that was paid to two consultants by  the  Department
of Public Enterprises. My report ruffled some feathers in the  corridors  of
power. However, to date those revelations have not been  disproved.  Yet  no
action has been taken to  redress  the  situation,  which  impoverishes  the
taxpayer and abuses the public trust. This kind of conduct  at  the  highest
level undermines investor confidence  and  accounts  for  the  hesitancy  of
potential investors to do business in this country.

In his Budget Speech the Minister of Finance said he would balance his 2000-
01 Budget by privatising state assets.  However,  the  conduct  of  some  of
these state enterprises  leaves  much  to  be  desired.  If  the  corruption
manifested in some of them is anything to go by, I  doubt  if  the  Minister
will achieve his objective.

For instance, I have in my possession here documents which  bring  into  the
open shady deals involving Transnet and a company in Cameroon. According  to
these documents, Transnet was offered a tender by Advanced  Technics  Trust,
a Cameroon company, for the maintenance  of  Boeing  737  and  747  aircraft
belonging to Cameroon Air, a  state-owned  corporation.  Transnet  admit  in
these documents that they paid R26,9  million  in  bribes  to  employees  of
Camair and influential government officials in Cameroon to  induce  Cameroon
Air into awarding the contract to SAA.

Today the Cameroon authorities are suing SAA for  approximately  R1  billion
in the international court for bribery and failure to  honour  the  contract
they concluded with ATT Ltd. I am reliably informed that  SAA  equipment  in
Cameroon could be impounded as a result of the litigation. The value of  the
equipment in question is about R1,5 billion.[Interjections.]

Mrs Z A KOTA: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: The  hon  member  referred
to  the  President,  at  the  time  he  was  Deputy  President,  chairing  a
clandestine committee on the procurement. I would appeal to the  Speaker  to
study the Hansard and see whether we can make a ruling on that.

The SPEAKER: But what is the point of order?

Mrs Z A KOTA: The point of order is the integrity of the President in  terms
of chairing a clandestine committee on the procurement.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: I ...

Mrs Z A KOTA: You said that. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order, hon members. I will certainly look  at  it.  I  did  not
hear that. It may have happened before I came.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: I did not say  so.  I  am  answering  you  now.  Sit  down.
[Interjections]

The SPEAKER: I will certainly look at at the Hansard. Just one  moment,  hon
member. Order! Hon members, I would ask you to listen  carefully  yourselves
and make a clear point of order. You cannot just say, ``Please read  Hansard
and see if there is a point of order''. I must ask that you point  out  what
is the point of order. Please proceed.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: This rhymes well with  the  comrades'  battle  cry  at  the
weekend rallies, when they say,  ``Aluta  continua!''  and  on  Mondays  the
looting continues in the executive boardrooms. [Interjections.]

Hundreds of thousands of rands will be spent investigating the  reasons  for
the fall of the rand when, in reality, the cause is here  at  home.  If  the
Minister wishes to learn more about the Cameroon  indaba,  I  am  more  than
willing to share notes with him over a cup of tea.

However, during his response in this debate he will  be  expected  to  brief
the House as to whether the information I give is authentic or not and  what
impact it has on the image of the country.

The UDM is concerned about the millions of  rands  that  the  Department  of
Foreign Affairs doles out to countries like the Comoros  islands  and  other
offshore causes. One wonders whether  these  amounts  are  approved  by  the
relevant portfolio committees of this House or  whether  they  indeed  reach
the intended destination when one recalls the ill-fated Sarafina 2 debacle.

It will be  difficult  for  the  residents  of  Khayelitsha,  Malamlela  and
Elliotdale to understand the rationale  for  giving  away  such  amounts  to
outside causes when they are told that there are no jobs,  no  food  and  no
medical care for them. If this is the price of the African  Renaissance  and
Nepad, then it is too expensive.

The third issue the UDM wishes to raise relates to poverty alleviation.  The
current child support grant supports children only to the age of seven.  Yet
at this age children must go to school, and parents  find  it  difficult  to
afford this additional expense whilst simultaneously being deprived  of  the
child support grant. The UDM appeals  to  Government  to  extend  the  child
support grant to cover children at least until the age of 15. Failure to  do
this makes a mockery  of  the  right  to  education  and  the  ANC  election
promises of free education.

Government has demonstrated a tendency to punish those who disagree with  it
by withholding poverty alleviation programmes. For example,  the  people  of
Malamlela in the Northern Province  claim  that  they  have  been  suffering
punishment ever since they questioned the decision to place them within  the
jurisdiction of a certain municipality. As a result they  did  not  vote  in
the 2000 elections out of protest. And now we  are  receiving  reports  that
road-building and other projects in their area have been halted.  This  type
of practice is morally wrong  and  reminds  us  of  the  way  the  apartheid
government punished through deprivation those who disagreed  with  it.  This
is a shocking example of  Government  contributing  to  poverty  instead  of
alleviating it. [Time expired.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, hon members,  there  is  a  famous
poem by John Keats which refers to ``stout Cortez, when with eagle  eyes  he
star'd at the Pacific.'' Well, Keats actually  got  it  wrong,  for  it  was
Magellan, rather than Cortez.

But what he was expressing was a state of wonderment and surprise -  a  kind
of elixir of life. Well, last Sunday I felt like that. At my age, I need  to
get elixirs of life. An extraordinary thing happened  at  the  cricket  test
match  between  ourselves  and  Australia,  when  five  young  men  recently
inducted into the team, particularly Hall and Prince, clapped  their  hands,
urged on their colleagues and pushed  them  on.  Even  though  we  were  not
winning, there was an extraordinary exhilaration they were showing.

I say this because  it  reflected  so  badly  on  their  colleagues  at  the
Wanderers, where they were listless. They lost from the first ball  onwards,
and they lost by an innings and 360 runs. These young people were  therefore
responding to a call. They were proud to play  for  South  Africa,  although
they were professionals. They were  genuinely  proud,  Prince  and  Hall  in
particular. They were motivated and grew up a little more in that process.

I felt like stout Cortez when I saw  this  happening,  a  most  illuminating
thing which our newspapers, with their deadlines and their  interviews  only
with players, never remarked on. And I felt like this also a  few  days  ago
when the Budget came. Let me tell hon members why. When we came into  office
in 1994, we came with a different approach. I was a Keynesian all  my  life.
I worked on the  basis  that  it  was  important  to  have  growth  and  job
creation, that one borrowed money for that, and that the  future  generation
would pay for that. Of course, what we encountered was not zero growth,  but
minus growth. We encountered a situation - and even  an  ordinary  economist
like me was frightened - of a  deficit  before  borrowing  of  over  9%.  Of
course our whole borrowing  reputation  -  we  were  responsible  for  this,
through our anti-apartheid movement - was in  tatters.  So  in  eight  years
there has been this remarkable change.

Of course, there are mean-spirited people. I like Bantu Holomisa because  he
is a genuinely friendly person and has a good physical presence, but  he  is
mean-spirited,  and  this  mean-spiritedness  is  destructive  in  the  end,
because he equates our intervention in Comoros with Virodene, when  the  hon
the Minister of Foreign Affairs is not  here  to  defend  herself.  What  an
extraordinary jump! It is an extraordinary jump because  she  is  performing
her official functions, which that hon  member  is,  mercifully,  no  longer
performing anywhere. She is not here. The Comoros issue was at  the  request
of the Organisation of African Unity. It was vital that we go there and  not
allow  foreign  intervention  and  mercenaries  once  again  to  destabilise
another African country. But it is only the  mean-spirited  who  would  say,
``For that R8 million or R10 million I could have gone  into  some  kind  of
settler here.'' The world does not work that way,  and  the  budget  of  the
department is clearly worked out.

I was intrigued by this, therefore, and by Mr Andrew  and  Mr  Bekker.  With
the extraordinary luxury of being in opposition, they were  trying  to  work
out the need for research facilities or  to  work  out  a  kind  of  instant
solution to our poverty. It is interesting how one can do all  those  things
in opposition without the luxury of having to apply them in any way.

So I say, specifically in relation to the Budget - and  this  is  the  first
time - that I felt like stout  Cortez  and  stared  in  wonderment.  But  we
could, in fact, increase it, since central to  poverty  eradication  is  the
old age pension. We could increase it over and above the level of  ...  what
is it called?
HON MEMBERS: Inflation!

The MINISTER: That is right.

An HON MEMBER: Whatever.

The MINISTER: Not ``whatever'', that is important, that is real  growth  and
that is what I am trying to show.

Of course, we could also do that with the children's grants. We could do  so
across  the  board  and,  in  particular,  in  relation  to  human  resource
development, which I want  to  speak  about.  In  his  opening  address  the
President referred to it in the following way:


  Decision-makers across the globe  have  accepted  the  reality  that  the
  global struggle to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment is  fundamental
  to the wellbeing of our human society.

Numerous references he made reaffirmed the Government's commitment to  human
resource development, largely because we all now know that the best  way  to
tackle and, we optimistically hope, in  the  end  to  eradicate  poverty  is
through education.

One generation should, through education, enable the next generation  to  be
better off and to be better qualified. That  is  what  apartheid  stultified
from 1924 onwards and, of course, the Land Act. It rejected  the  idea  that
one generation of the Africans would improve the next, and  we  have  to  do
that now. Why? As George Orwell said, the  most  important  people  are  the
great unwashed in our country. But the development of our greatest  resource
is, like Orwell's, that of our people, and fundamental in  the  Government's
strategy is to deal with this thing.

That is why the Minister of  Labour  and  I  presented  the  human  resource
development strategy to the Cabinet last April as  a  people-driven  process
of transformation and social development. Now we are moving, after  a  year,
to   involving   the   people   more   directly   through    nongovernmental
organisations, business and the unions to ensure that there is proper  shape
and growth in our policies. Furthermore, it is a key priority  for  us  this
year. As the President said, it is the surest guarantee of  sustainable  job
employment and economic development.
The overarching goals are extremely ambitious. They  include  improving  the
human index of development for the country, a reduction  of  inequality  and
an improved position in  the  international  competitive  scale.  The  human
resource is computed by using indicators such as life expectancy  at  birth,
levels of adult literacy and the level of attainment  of  general  schooling
in the population.

The reduction  of  inequality  takes  place  within  the  broad  development
strategy that focuses on the poor in  this  country.  The  fact  that  South
Africa is second only to Brazil as the most unequal  society  in  the  world
serves to confirm the importance of these goals.  So  we  are  finding  this
out. Through our skills levy, the Ministers of Education, Labour, Trade  and
Industry and  the  Public  Service  and  Administration  have  been  working
together to identify the skills required in the labour market.

We can no longer depend on supply side. That  is  sangomas  throwing  bones,
and I have more respect for sangomas than the economists who  used  to  say,
``We need more engineers,'' and when we produced some more  engineers,  they
would be unemployed. The same  thing  happens  with  the  National  Research
Foundation, where we are  identifying  scholarships  and  paying  for  these
scholarships so that candidates acquire skills in science and technology.

Most importantly, I want to inform the House, as a statement of  fact,  that
Government's contribution to the National  Students'  Financial  Aid  Scheme
has gone up from R450 million to R500 million. In addition  -  I  think  the
green book is not entirely correct - the National  Students'  Financial  Aid
Scheme has found R200 million more in the repayment of loans and  this  year
we are distributing R700 million. The  imagination  cannot  encompass  that,
because 232 000 young people have gone through by  means  of  financial  aid
and over R3,5 billion has been spent on them.  I  should  inform  the  House
also that those who are financially assisted do better at  higher  education
than those children who are paid for by their fond parents.

We are reforming the technical college sector,  reducing  the  150  racially
organised technical colleges to  50.  There  has  been  no  problem  at  all
because it is now  being  implemented  this  year.  Higher  education  is  a
different matter altogether. Teacher training was at a very  poor  level  up
to two years ago. The teacher training college has  been  incorporated  into
higher education. There are vacant places,  it  is  true,  elsewhere.  These
vacant places have to be filled by provinces themselves.

We  are  reforming  the  structures  with  a  view  to  greater  equity  and
restructuring for the purposes of  a  greater  return  for  our  society.  I
cannot leave this, of course, without looking  at  the  question  of  higher
education, because the system  is  poised  for  change  this  year.  We  are
grateful to the Minister that we are one of the few countries in  the  world
that have maintained our investment in higher education. For the next  three
years, in real terms, expenditure in higher education will go up.

Nearly every other country, unfortunately, through the baneful influence  of
a  loss-cost  approach  by  the  World  Bank,  has  seen  its   universities
deteriorating to the extent that there are no facilities left for the  young
people. We have maintained our investment. We provided real redress  against
apartheid by getting these 232 000  children  into  higher  education.  This
year in our national plan for higher education we have  said  that  we  want
100 000 more young people in higher education so that we can, in  fact,  get
the kind of graduates to meet  our  human  resource  development  needs.  It
takes 10 years to get 100 000 more. It means we have to totally  restructure
our higher education.

We cannot have an ICT university without restructuring the university  on  a
regional basis. Can I, therefore, say that  there  would  be  a  fundamental
change this year, but it is still going to  the  Cabinet.  Restructuring  is
not for its own purpose. The purpose is to reorganise the sector in  such  a
way  that  we  develop  a  vibrant  and  quality  higher  education   system
responsive to the country's needs in human resource  development.  There  is
research capacity. We saw the report.

There is very little research capacity, most important of all, to  fuel  our
economic, social and intellectual developments. I  will  go  back  again  to
stout Cortez, when ... ``He star'd at the Pacific'' for the first  time.  He
saw, of course, he was there, the battle was to go back  again.  Our  battle
was a battle for freedom, our battle was  a  battle  for  emancipation  from
apartheid, and I go back to one of the greatest poets of old  time,  Bertolt
Brecht, who wrote in the Songs of the soldiers  of  revolution,  ``When  the
difficulty of the mountain is once behind, that's when, you  will  see,  the
difficulty of the plains will start.''
Though our experience of the 20th century in South Africa has  been  one  of
negotiating a  higher  mountain,  fraught  with  enormous  difficulties  and
sacrifices, from that plain we have come to the triumph of a battle and  now
we need the real liberation - to enjoy a  social  contract  between  workers
and Government and business and Government so that we  can  enter  the  21st
century away from the deceptive calm  of  the  mountains  and  in  the  real
battle of the plains, and that is to tackle poverty and alienation, to  have
growth and make a fit place for all our children to be cherished equally  in
South Africa. I thank the Minister of Finance for his Budget. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, let me begin my input by extending  the  ACDP's
congratulations to  Minister  Manuel  for  receiving  an  honorary  doctoral
degree. I believe that this award to Minister Manuel is well deserved.

The Budget of 2002 certainly  has  given  much  confidence  to,  especially,
every South African about  the  state  of  our  economy.  The  tight  fiscal
control over the last few years is paying off in real terms,  especially  if
Government could concentrate on its responsibility to social  infrastructure
needs. Growth in real terms of almost 4% is  predicted  over  the  next  few
years, and this should provide sufficient boost to  our  economy,  which  is
gaining strength against other stronger economies.

Our country is  steadily  improving  its  objective  of  economic  stability
within the Southern African region. Based  on  its  macroeconomic  policies,
Government  was  able  to  provide  increased  spending  on  infrastructure,
police, HIV/Aids and social security grants.

Many South Africans will already know by now that  they  will  benefit  from
the R15 billion in tax relief this year. There is  great  anticipation  that
we will witness some growth in our  economy,  especially  within  the  small
business sector and the export market. Our steel industry will also  benefit
from the recent decision by America to import our steel at reasonable  entry
levels.

With its emphasis on poverty alleviation, provinces will  receive  an  extra
R20,5 billion over the next three years to improve the social conditions  of
those most in need. The  increase  in  child  support  grants  and  pensions
should provide some reasonable relief for the poor.  Whether  this  increase
will sustain against the Reserve Bank's uncertainty to  confidently  predict
its  control  over  inflation  targeting,  is  a  matter  that  will  impact
negatively on the poor if we fail to keep inflation at reasonable levels.

Already the daily battering of the rand is taking its toll on  food  prices.
For all households, basic needs like shelter,  food  and  security  are  top
priority items. A shift in the stability of  any  of  these  items  must  be
avoided at all costs. If we allow the  downward  slide  in  basic  needs  to
continue,  a  society  loses  hope  in  itself  and  in  its  political  and
socioeconomic infrastructures. What  happens,  as  a  consequence,  is  that
because of a weakened society, the ruthless  make  themselves  leaders  over
the people to lay claim to whatever resources they can obtain.

We are in the fortunate position that ours is a nation  that  wants  to  get
things right, especially in terms of our  past  legacy.  Ours  is  a  nation
which fought injustices and crimes against humanity.  Year  after  year,  we
remember those who have died so that we can enjoy a country  with  a  future
that will render better education, better health, and better  security,  and
a country that strives for equal opportunities without fear of  intimidation
and harassment of its people.  These  were  the  moral  imperatives  of  the
struggle, and these same imperatives should  provide  moral  leadership  and
aid to our neighbouring states whose democratic and human rights values  are
under severe attack.

Our  previous  government  committed  the  immoral   act   of   purposefully
destabilising our  neighbours.  Our  political  leaders  must  work  towards
stabilising  this  region,  which  sometimes  demands   that   our   present
Government take a stronger stand against political leaders who  violate  the
human rights of their own people.

If South Africa wants to enjoy economic growth beyond the 2% to  3%  margin,
then it must send out the signal to the world  that  we  are  serious  about
democracy and economic freedom, not only in our own  country,  but  also  in
our neighbouring states. Although  we  may  have  put  in  place  the  right
economic policy, this can be easily undone by improper foreign policies.  We
will risk serious structural damage to our economy if we do not take  urgent
policy stands  against  the  undemocratic  activities  of  our  neighbouring
countries.

The way South Africa deals with foreign policy issues will  have  a  bearing
on whether we will face the risk of being excluded from  future  prospective
capital flows. Will the outcome of the Zimbabwean  elections  affect  direct
foreign investment to this country? We must not fool ourselves that  because
we have  a  stronger  economy  than  Zimbabwe  the  investing  nations  will
overlook the political factors displayed  when  we  do  not  make  a  strong
stand.

In conclusion, the ACDP believes that this Budget  is  the  best  one  since
Minister Manuel's appointment, and we wish to commend him for  this  Budget.
We also want to commend the Director-General of Finance and  the  Department
of Finance for their sterling work.  We  support  this  Budget,  because  we
believe that it does more for the development of the poorest  of  the  poor.
[Applause.]

Mr M S BOOI: Madam Speaker,  my  colleagues,  I  want  to  congratulate  the
Minister of Finance, whom I happen to have known  for  many  years,  on  the
sterling work he is doing with the finances of our country.

I know the hon the Minister's commitment to the poor. I know  that  all  the
efforts and the struggle are to make sure that the  poor  are  able  to  put
bread on the table.

I would like to tell the hon the  Minister  that  as  we  reflected  on  and
looked his Budget, as the committee we then  concluded  that  it  was  quite
clear that the Budget is meant to address the issues of the  poor.  The  way
the Minister has been able to formulate it, it is quite  clear  that  it  is
able to handle some  of  the  social  issues  that  were  left  out  by  the
apartheid regime.

As far as I am concerned, the issue that I have to reflect on is safety  and
security, because the issues that the Minister has highlighted have  enabled
us to fight for peace.

I want to tell hon members that I am dedicating  my  contribution  today  to
baby Tshepang. Baby Tshepang, from the  Northern  Cape,  was  sodomised  and
raped. We must say that the sterling work that has been done by the  police,
who have been able to arrest the criminal involved in the rape of the  baby,
is quite important. More importantly,  the  arrest  was  carried  out  by  a
policewoman. She was able to put together the case and succeeded in  tracing
the criminal. With all the information they had and  in  spite  of  all  the
criticism, she showed her obligation and was able to solve the case.

So I want to make my own contribution by dedicating my contribution  to  the
police and the work that they are doing within the service  for  that  baby.
We must say to the hon the Minister that  his  contribution  to  the  Police
Service has helped us improve  our  detective  service.  Since  we  came  to
power, our detective work has been gradually improving each year,  and  that
to us is very important. That is why  they  were  able  to  solve  the  case
involving baby Tshepang.

Although  the  communities  are  able  to  bring  some  information  to  the
detectives, our detectives are able to make sure that the cases are  solved,
and that is one of the reasons we say that the Budget will help us.

The second issue that the hon the Minister of Finance knows,  has  been  one
of the critical problems that  we  have  been  confronted  with  within  the
Western Cape, is the issue of  gangsterism.  I  must  say  to  the  hon  the
Minister that as a result of the vision outlined by the Minister  of  Safety
and Security and the National Commissioner of Police, and  of  looking  into
criminal intelligence, there is a hell of an improvement  in  how  they  are
able to gather information against gangsters.

From the last report they were able to put in front  of  us,  it  was  quite
clear that they are fairly informed about the activities of  the  gangsters.
They are able to follow the syndicates wherever they are. They are  able  to
wreck and break some of these crime syndicates.  They  have  penetrated  the
gangs right into prison. We congratulate the  police  on  this  achievement.
What we are saying is that the Minister's improved avocation to  the  Police
Service will contribute a lot towards assisting our policemen.

That is not the only point I would like to make. One of the  most  important
things that I am here for is to look into the  work,  because  this  is  the
month of safety and security according to the programme of  volunteerism  of
the ANC. We wanted to look and see how much  progress  has  been  made  over
this period.

We were able to present a report here, through  the  hon  the  Minister  for
Intelligence. She was able to report as to how many people have  volunteered
for service in the country. Now she  has  come  up  with  500  people.  That
figure has improved quite tremendously. The figure that we could be  looking
at has gone way beyond 30 000. Gauteng has  given  us  a  total  of  20  723
volunteers; the Western Cape has only given us 2 450; the  Eastern  Cape  10
158; the Northern Cape, 962; the Free State, 23 676; the North West, 6  228;
Mpumalanga, 6 728; Limpopo, 4 568; and Kwazulu-Natal, 3 361.

Overall our  figures  are  standing  at  78  854.  That  is  the  number  of
volunteers that we have received over this period. It quite clearly says  to
us that the communities out there are willing to co-operate  and  work  with
the police. They also state to us that the growing confidence  in  the  work
of the Police Service itself is one of the things that we have  put  on  the
table for the police to improve their budget. That would  be  quite  helpful
for us.

What we want to say to the Minister is that that  contribution  itself  will
go a very long way in trying to stabilise the crime that we  are  confronted
with. As we go beyond the issue that  I  tried  to  raise  yesterday,  I  am
raising it again because I am concerned.  I  want  to  raise  it  again  and
express it quite resolutely as a member of Parliament.

The issue we  are  raising  in  relation  to  section  49  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Act of 1977 is a problem. We do not think that the way the  Deputy
Minister dealt with it yesterday was quite enough. It is not  good  for  the
record of the Government and the processes of South Africa's democracy  that
we have been able to go through.

What we are saying is that this section  49  allows  and  gives  the  police
powers to shoot and kill any criminal that they  come  across.  Our  problem
with that is that if ever a kid of 14 years picks up a  loaf  of  bread  and
runs and the police come across that kid, they have the right to  shoot  him
if ever we allow them to practise according to  this  legislation.  We  have
been trying to stop that. It has been more than seven years now.

It has been since 1977 that this law has  been  lying  there  and  that  the
Department has not been able to implement it. I wanted to say to the  Deputy
Minister yesterday that, given the record of the  Government  and  of  human
rights in our country, it does not augur well at all for them to allow  that
process and not to take the decision in relation to section 49.

I want the House to understand that, because it  is  the  responsibility  of
Parliament to defend and uphold the  Constitution  and  the  Bill  of  Human
Rights. If that is not being implemented, it is an  indictment  on  our  own
democracy. I want to say to this House, as a representative of  the  public,
that the fact that the legislation is not moving forward  is  an  indictment
on our human rights record that we have been able to set.

We know as the members of the ANC that we have  been  confronted  with  this
type of problem on many occasions where we  have  been  asked  to  lay  down
arms, and asked by the movement to suspend the armed struggle. We have  been
able to do those things without question or reluctance. That  is  where  our
strength lies. Our strength lies in the fact that we  have  a  tradition  of
being able to say that if ever one wants to use  one's  gun,  one  does  not
have to use it to shoot at people and kill them. One must have a  reason  to
do that.

What the Deputy Minister tried to do yesterday was to shift around  and  not
to give us that particular answer. I am saying,  because  we  are  launching
Human Rights Day, let them apply their minds and take a political  decision.
Let them see to it that that particular legislation gets implemented.  There
is no way we could  continue  postponing  it,  because  if  we  continue  to
postpone it, with the 700 deaths that the police have been  responsible  for
so far, it is a bad record for our democracy. We  would  never  be  able  to
rest for those who  are  loyal  within  the  ANC  to  make  sure  that  this
legislation gets implemented. That is one of the things  that  I  wanted  to
say.

Lastly, the other most  important  thing  that  we  wanted  to  reflect  on,
following from what hon van Schalkwyk  has  been  able  to  raise  here,  is
talking about the issues of unity, and of how we  should  be  able  to  work
together. Under Mr Mluleki George's leadership within our committee we  have
been able to put together a consensus and a way of relating to one  another.
We have been able to tell ourselves that crime is one of the issues that  we
get confronted with as South Africans. It is not in  the  interests  of  the
country that we should be able to politicise this issue. It is  not  in  the
interests of the country that we should be able to play our party  politics.
It is quite important that we all should be united  around  this  particular
issue.

The President has shown it  by  action  and  by  calling  upon  every  South
African to take the responsibility  of  volunteering  and  going  to  police
stations and communities to mobilise them to participate in this programme.

We want to continue encouraging members, as we go on  leave  or  recess,  by
saying that they should take this responsibility with them  as  we  continue
wanting to strengthen democracy and as we  continue  making  sure  that  the
fundamental principles of democracy are upheld. This  is  just  one  of  the
responsibilities which we, as South Africans, should be able  to  take  upon
ourselves as we make sure that we get ourselves quite actively  involved  in
assisting in the fight against crime.

When one finds a community policing forum  which  is  divided  according  to
racial lines one should, as a  member  of  Parliament,  be  quite  concerned
about what is happening and about what  that  community  policing  forum  is
confronted with; one should take it as being  one's  responsibility  to  get
involved in assisting those communities to improve  the  community  policing
forum so that all of us can be seen to be playing a particular role in  that
situation.

As we are aware, baby Tshepang was confronted with being a  victim  of  rape
and sodomy perpetrated by human beings, people who are irresponsible,  never
mind the colour line or party line and wherever they come  from.  The  issue
that one gets confronted with is that our kids and babies are  being  raped.
The  responsibility  rests  with  our  own  consciences,   as   members   of
Parliament. How much do we want to come together to be  able  to  fight  the
crime situation? Within the community and with every  member  of  Parliament
that serves in the safety and security committee, that  responsibility  goes
a long way.

We have been able to adopt the view that we would be fighting against  crime
as a team of youngsters. I am saying: Let us do it together. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, as ek maar soveel tyd soos  die  vorige
spreker gehad het. Ek het oor al die  jare  na  meer  as  12  begrotings  in
hierdie Raad geluister en dit sou onbillik  vir  my  wees  om  die  Minister
vandag slegs te kritiseer, wetende dat dit een van die beter  begrotings  is
wat ooit van hierdie podium af gelewer is. Dit is min  dat  'n  Minister  so
kan geld uitdeel en aan die  ander  kant  aan  departemente  ekstra  sosiale
toelaes kan gee, sonder om aangrypend belastings te  verhoog.  Tog  het  die
Minister dit in hierdie begroting in 'n groot mate reg gekry.  Ek  dink  tog
dat as die Minister alleen in die aand met  sy  gewete  is,  dan  prewel  hy
saggies: Dankie, Pravin Gordhan; dankie, Pravin Gordhan.

As daar na die begroting en die makro-ekonomiese  faktore  gekyk  word,  dan
gaan dit goed met Suid-Afrika en behoort ons van krag tot krag te gaan.  Tog
is dit nie die geval nie. Die inflasiekoers het gestyg.  Vanmiddag  het  die
rentekoers met een persent gestyg, en die groeikoers  daal  nog  deurlopend.
Ons beweeg  eintlik  in  die  verkeerde  rigting,  nieteenstaande  'n  goeie
begroting. Die vraag  is:  Waarom?  Omdat  ons  nie  daarin  slaag  om  meer
werksgeleenthede te skep nie - en ek wil dit eenvoudig soos  dit  maak.  Die
Minister  het  toegewings  aan  die  kleinsakesektor  in  hierdie  begroting
gemaak. Ek is egter bevrees dit is nie genoeg nie.

Gister het die Adjunkminister van  Veiligheid  en  Sekuriteit  aangedui  dat
meer as 600 000 aansoeke gekry is vir die 16 000 nuwe polisieposte. Die  600
000  werkloses  wat  aansoek  doen,  almal  persone  met  matriek  en  meer,
illustreer die probleem. Ek is bevrees dat hierdie Minister met  behulp  van
die begroting nie hierdie probleem van werkloosheid sal kan oplos  nie.  Die
antwoord  is  myns  insiens  eenvoudig   en   moet   by   sy   kollega   wat
verantwoordelik  is  vir   arbeid   gesoek   word.   Slegs   meer   buigsame
arbeidswetgewing gaan hierdie probleem oplos; iets waaroor Mnr  Manuel,  wat
my betref, nie beheer het nie.

In die lig van die begroting het die VF gedink die Minister  kon  dalk  meer
konkrete hulp aan Saambou gegee het, soos nou met BOE gedoen word.  Dan  was
dit dalk nie nodig om op hierdie wyse nou vertroue  in  die  Suid-Afrikaanse
ekonomie en veral in die banksektor te moet herstel nie.

Een  van  die  probleme  wat  ons  hierdie  jaar  steeds  gaan  hê,  is  die
geleidelike verdere verswakking van die waarde van  die  rand.  Dit  het  'n
regstreekse invloed op inflasie en op ons groeikoers. Die afgelope  week  se
gebeure in Zimbabwe help geensins om die rand se waarde te stabiliseer  nie.
As die Zimbabwiese uitslae ontleed word, is dit duidelik hoe  daar  'n  baie
hoë  stempersentasie  was  in  die  pro-Mugabegebiede   en   'n   baie   lae
stempersentasie in die Tsvangiraigebiede.  Dit  dui  tog  duidelik  aan  tot
watter  mate  Zanu-PF  dan  geslaag  het  deur  middel  van  administratiewe
vertragings, intimidasie, manipulasie en MDC-kiesers van  die  stembusse  af
weg te hou. So was daar 'n oorweldigende toename in die hoeveelheid  mobiele
en ander stemburo's in die platteland, wat Mugabegebied is, en  tot  'n  50%
vermindering van stemburo's in stedelike gebiede,  wat  MDC-gebied  is.  Vir
tienduisende kiesers in die Hararegebied was  dit  onmoontlik  om  te  stem;
selfs na die verlenging van  die  stemtydperk.  Met  tye  was  daar  in  die
Hararegebied tot 6 000 mense in een tou wat geduldig  staan  en  wag  om  te
stem, terwyl die stemtempo op daardie stadium tussen  vyf  na  tien  persone
per uur was. Wat my betref, is dit berekende administratiewe vertraging.

Die ware toets vir demokrasie is nie om van hierdie  podium  van  demokrasie
en menseregte te praat nie. Dit is vir my  maklik.  Dit  is  vir  ons  almal
maklik. Dit is  veral  maklik  as  mens  in  die  ANC  is  wat  met  sy  66%
meerderheid die regerende party  is.  Die  ware  toets  vir  demokrasie  kom
wanneer 'n regerende politieke party die risiko loop om  die  politieke  mag
te verloor. Dit is die toets wat  President  Mugabe  die  afgelope  jaar  in
Zimbabwe geskryf het en na my mening nie geslaag het nie. Die bereidheid  om
alle partye 'n gelyke geleentheid in die media en tydens die  verkiesing  te
gee, is ware demokrasie. Dit is wat Pres Mbeki se Nepad inisiatief  voorstel
soos ek dit verstaan.

As die Suid-Afrikaanse  regering  verkeerd  op  die  Zimbabwiese  verkiesing
reageer, moet ons aanvaar dat dit 'n groot effek op die rand se waarde  gaan
hê. Ons moet ook aanvaar dat die mooi ideale van Nepad skade  aangedoen  sal
word. Ons het groot wysheid om uit hierdie dilemma te  kom,  sonder  om  die
ekonomie enige skade te doen. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, if only I had as much time as the  previous
speaker. Throughout the years in this House I have listened to  12  Budgets,
and it would be unfair of me to only criticise the Minister  today,  knowing
that this is one of the better Budgets that have ever  been  delivered  from
this podium. It is rare that a Minister can allocate money  in  such  a  way
and then also give extra social grants to  departments  without  drastically
increasing taxes. Yet, to a large extent, the Minister  managed  to  achieve
this with this Budget. However, I do think that when the Minister  is  alone
at night with only his conscience, he  softly  mumbles:  Thank  you,  Pravin
Gordhan; thank you, Pravin Gordhan.

If one looks at the budget and the macroeconomic factors, it is  going  well
with South Africa and we should go from strength to  strength.  Still,  this
is not the case. The  inflation  rate  has  increased.  This  afternoon  the
interest rate increased by l%, and  the  growth  rate  is  still  decreasing
consistently.  In  fact,   we   are   moving   in   the   wrong   direction,
notwithstanding a sound Budget. The question is: Why?  Because  we  are  not
succeeding in creating more job opportunities - and I  would  like  to  make
this simple. The Minister has made concessions to the small business  sector
in this Budget. However, I am afraid that this is not enough.

Yesterday the Deputy Minister of Safety and Security pointed out  that  more
than 600 000 applications were received for the 16  000  new  police  posts.
The 600 000 unemployed who  applied,  all  persons  with  matric  and  more,
illustrate this problem. I am afraid that this Minister with the  assistance
of the Budget will not be able to solve this problem of unemployment. In  my
opinion, the answer is simple and should be sought from  his  colleague  who
is responsible for labour. Only more flexible labour legislation will  solve
this problem; something that Mr Manuel, in my opinion, does not control.

In the light of the Budget, the FF thought that the Minister  could  perhaps
have given more concrete assistance to Saambou, as  is  now  the  case  with
BOE. Then, perhaps, it would not be necessary to have to  restore  faith  in
this manner in the South African economy and especially banking.

One of the problems that we  will  still  face  this  year  is  the  gradual
further devaluation of the rand. This has a direct impact on  inflation  and
our growth rate. The events of the past week in Zimbabwe do not help at  all
to stabilise the  value  of  the  rand.  When  the  Zimbabwean  results  are
analysed, it is apparent that there has been a very high  voting  percentage
in the pro-Mugabe areas, and a very low voting percentage in the  Tsvangirai
areas. This clearly indicates to what extent Zanu-PF has succeeded by  means
of administrative delays, intimidation, manipulation and keeping MDC  voters
from the voting booths. In this way there was an  overwhelming  increase  in
the number of mobile and other polling stations in the  rural  areas,  which
is Mugabe territory, and an almost  50%  decrease  in  polling  stations  in
urban areas, which is MDC territory. For tens of thousands of voters in  the
Harare area it was impossible to vote;  even  after  the  extension  of  the
voting period. At times, in the Harare area, there were up to 6  000  people
in one queue who patiently stood and waited to vote while  the  voting  rate
at that stage was between five and ten persons  per  hour.  In  my  opinion,
this is a calculated administrative delay.

The true test of democracy is not to speak of  democracy  and  human  rights
from this podium. That is easy for me. That is easy for all  of  us.  It  is
especially easy if one is in the ANC that is, with  its  66%  majority,  the
governing party. The true test of democracy is when  a  governing  political
party runs the risk of  losing  political  power.  This  is  the  test  that
President Mugabe took the past year in Zimbabwe and, in my opinion, did  not
pass. The willingness to give all parties an equal opportunity in the  media
and during the election, is true democracy. This is what  President  Mbeki's
Nepad initiative proposes, as I understand it.

If the South African Government does not react properly  to  the  Zimbabwean
elections, we must accept that it will have a great impact on the  value  of
the rand. One should also accept that the  fine  ideals  of  Nepad  will  be
damaged. We have great wisdom to survive this dilemma, without damaging  the
economy.]

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Madam Speaker, hon members, the Budget of  2001  was  dubbed
``Manuel's Sweet Fruit Budget'' and we all received  apples  as  we  entered
the House. This year we received grapes, which must be  an  indication  that
the fruits of labour can now be enjoyed by millions in the country.

A budget is not only  about  figures  that  are  arranged  and  balanced  in
respect  of  income  and  expenditure.  This  Budget  is  driven  by   three
objectives that are fundamental  to  the  strategic  goals  of  the  ANC-led
Government. These goals are the eradication of  poverty  and  vulnerability;
the growth and development of our economy; and the construction of a people-
centred society based on the principle of human dignity.

The majority of South Africans suffered in the past for more than  40  years
under a regime that retarded economic growth whilst forcefully  implementing
its racist ideology, leaving a legacy of inequality.
Mrs Daniels of Manenberg in  my  constituency  in  the  Western  Cape  said,
``Poverty is not wanting your children to come  home  because  you  have  no
bread to give them; fearing the council truck because it might stop at  your
door to put your furniture in the street; and praying that  the  madam  will
understand that there was no money for taxi fare.''

Mrs Daniels also wants to thank the Minister. She is extremely grateful  for
the two increases  in  pension  in  their  household  income.  We  must  now
continue to invest in the most valuable asset in our country,  that  is  its
people.

To be able to implement the macroeconomic policy of Government, the  revenue
base must be strong and sound. Since 1994  tax  policy,  supported  by  deep
structural  changes  to  tax   administration,   compliance,   culture   and
collection, has consistently  delivered  revenue  growth  that  enabled  the
fiscus to reduce the  deficit,  whilst  expanding  public  services  to  the
people of our country.

The programme of  fiscal  discipline,  sound  management,  focused  spending
programmes and continual tax relief remains  the  hallmark  of  our  ANC-led
Government. The rise in company tax was the main driver  of  the  extra  R15
billion in revenue collected that allowed the  Minister  to  cut  taxes  for
individuals and provide for poverty alleviation. Closing  the  gap  is  what
makes tax relief and rising social spending possible.

We,  therefore,  must  congratulate  the  Receiver  of  Revenue  under   the
leadership of Mr Pravin Gordhan, his approximately 12 000 employees and  the
millions of patriotic and compliant taxpayers on earnestly  contributing  to
the building of the new South Africa.

The tax relief package for  individuals  contributes  towards  reducing  the
cost of employment, and rewards work and savings. It also  narrows  the  gap
between the lower and higher earning brackets, making more  money  available
to the individuals in  the  lower  and  middle  salary  brackets,  therefore
stimulating the economy.

The Minister, or the doctor Minister Trevor Manuel, said there  are  various
taxpayers: those who pay their taxes in the patriotic manner,  like  members
in this House; those who are unaware of their obligations; those  who  avoid
full compliance through  aggressive  tax  planning  while  adhering  to  the
letter of the law, and those who simply ignore the obligations.  I  want  to
say to those who simply ignore the obligations to come forward  and  pay.  A
strong economy will benefit all, especially those who need it most.

Everyone once again applauded the Minister  for  his  Budget,  and  ordinary
people gave the Budget a vote of confidence. But the most important part  of
a successful budget is the spending and the delivery. A bigger  budget  does
not necessarily mean a better budget. It is the delivery and the quality  of
service that is the most important outcome of a budget.

Civil servants are employed persons who serve the people of our country  and
who  affect  the  delivery  of  service.  To  make  spending  and   delivery
effective, there must be a culture of work, a work ethos.

I would like to take an example from  nature  to  illustrate  this.  At  one
stage the fish population along the  Japanese  coast  became  depleted.  The
Japanese discovered later that this was  because  of  the  otters  they  had
killed for their fur. So what role does the otter play in this  food  chain?
Sea urchins thrive on the roots of  big  brown  seaweed,  called  kelp,  and
destroy the kelp forests. No kelp means no food and no  breeding  place  for
the fish, so they disappear. The  otters'  favourite  food,  again,  is  sea
urchins. The whole day the otter goes about laboriously  with  its  task  of
eating these sea urchins. No otters means plenty of sea  urchins,  and  thus
no kelp. The end result is the fish colony's destruction.

But what biologists found very strange is why the otter works  so  hard.  It
does not have to work so hard. The otter could lie  leisurely  on  its  back
the whole day and eat the sea urchin now and then. It can still  survive  on
the least amount of effort. Why work harder than you have to?

Hon members must understand that it is in the otter to work so hard. It  has
a built-in genetic code, an ethos of work for the sake of the  good  of  the
whole system. A culture of working for the good of  all  South  Africans  is
what we must work towards.

My constituency office has dealings with  a  Miss  Elizabeth  Stall  of  the
Bellville welfare office. She goes that extra mile to assist us to help  our
people. She gave us her cellphone number, and offers to  help  any  time  of
the day. It is civil servants like her and many  others  who  go  the  extra
mile like the otter - no favours asked, no  ulterior  motives.  Working  for
change for the good of the whole is what makes the Budget, at  the  delivery
point, a success.

Let us do what our President is doing. Let all of us continue this  year  to
mobilise for reconstruction and development, not just for the  good  of  the
whole country, but also for the good of the whole of the African  continent,
because the whole is only as good as its parts.  And,  if  we  embrace  this
culture, we will all enjoy the fruits of our labour. Let us  go  forward  in
the spirit of Batho Pele - people first. [Applause.]

Mrs M A SEECO: Madam Speaker, since Budget day almost  a  month  ago,  there
has been talk about the balance and consideration given to put it together.

We, in the UCDP, give the nod to the allocation to the Department of  Safety
and Security. This department has the highest allocation of  16,90%  of  the
entire Budget. It is expected that citizens of this  country  will  be  kept
safe in  their  homes.  We  hope  that  police  stations  will  be  properly
resourced and members of the SAPS's salaries will be improved.
Education has the  fourth  highest  allocation,  at  7,75%,  of  the  entire
Budget. This is the department that has to prepare the  nation  for  greater
things in life. The  department  has  to  provide  tuition  and  educational
facilities from preprimary school level until university. The Department  of
Education has to give grants in respect of  financial  management,  HIV/Aids
and childhood development.

The amount of R6 billion allocated  to  the  Department  of  Provincial  and
Local Government is a sure sign of recognition that the  department  has  to
cater for the needs of municipalities, some of which are  tottering  on  the
brink of bankruptcy while others are wallowing in  the  deep  end  of  debt.
There is no doubt that the huge financial injection will get this  level  of
government out of the financial doldrums.

It still boggles the  mind  to  find  that  the  Department  of  Defence  is
allocated the second highest  amount  after  Safety  and  Security.  In  our
opinion, there is no need to allocate so much money to this department.  The
country is not at war, and seems to be facing  no  war  in  the  foreseeable
future. [Interjections.]
The Department of Social Development has to fight poverty.  It  has  to  aim
for the eradication of poverty and not be modest  by  referring  to  poverty
alleviation. It is noted that there is an  increase  in  the  allocation  to
welfare service transformation to aid and protect the  rights  of  children,
youth, women and older persons. To us, Social Development should  have  been
among the first 10 departments to be  allocated  high  amounts  and  not  be
relegated to the middle of the table while it has  to  cater  for  the  most
vulnerable members of our society.

We note that, following the President's state of the nation  address,  crime
prevention is a national priority and that is why Safety  and  Security  has
been allocated the biggest slice of the loaf. We appreciate that  Education,
Health and Housing are amongst the top 10  Votes,  which  is  an  indication
that Government means well in addressing the plight of the nation.

The UCDP supports the Appropriation Bill.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, a nation's budget is a reflection of what  it
values and where its priorities are.

South Africa's Gini coefficient shows that  we  live  in  the  most  unequal
society in the world. This has  created  extreme  poverty  for  the  African
majority and extreme wealth for the minority population.

The Gear policy is perpetuating this state of  affairs.  It  is  distressing
that this Parliament continues to receive national  budgets  which  do  very
little to bridge the economic gap in inequality. Solidarity  with  the  poor
is more important than the rhetoric of ``sweet  fruits  of  liberty'',  when
those fruits are enjoyed by a tiny minority.

Our country needs a budget which fundamentally  reconstructs  the  lives  of
the poor to enable them  to  live  in  dignity.  This  means  accepting  the
failure of Gear, which  has  caused  massive  loss  of  jobs  and  has  kept
millions homeless, landless and unable to acquire  education.  Education  is
becoming more and more unaffordable for the poor. Poverty  alleviation  will
be a pipe dream as long as equitable redistribution of land is  ignored  and
the myth remains that land claims from 1913  will  satisfy  land  hunger  in
this country.

The majority of this country are poor. They do  not  have  money  to  spend.
African businesses are failing because they do not have decent  markets  and
are not protected. Business concerns are collapsing throughout the  country.
Our youth and women are wasted  because  they  are  not  working.  They  are
uneducated, sick, alienated and helpless. Many lack basic services  such  as
water, good roads and health care, especially in the rural areas.

The PAC agrees that our country must be in a state of military  preparedness
against external aggression, but it is  ridiculous  that  over  R50  billion
should be spent on arms when millions of citizens in our country  suffer  so
much. The Government has refused to cancel the arms deal.  This  is  despite
the fact that it  is  internationally  accepted  that  contracts  which  are
tainted with corruption are null and void and can be cancelled.

During the Budget process for the year 2000-01, the PAC advocated  that  the
old age pension be raised to R700. It is a shame  that  the  2002-03  Budget
has increased this pension by a mere R50, making  it  R620.  There  is  talk
about ``people first'', but when citizens of this country everywhere  demand
basic services and HIV/Aids drugs,  including  nevirapine  for  HIV-positive
pregnant  mothers,  Government  Ministers  respond  by   fast-tracking   the
privatisation of state assets and resisting the legitimate  demands  of  the
people.

It  is  important  that  the  principle  of  poverty  eradication   not   be
contradicted by economic policies such as  Gear  and  the  privatisation  of
state assets, which enrich the rich and aggravate the poverty of the poor.

Child mortality is already high amongst Africans.  They  have  the  shortest
life expectancy. It is forecast that by 2020 the average life  span  of  the
African people in this country will drop from 57 to 50  years.  The  country
needs a budget that  is  based  on  an  economic  policy  which  serves  the
interests of the poor, while not reducing  the  wealth  of  those  who  have
overcome poverty. Despite our disagreement with the  policy  on  which  this
Budget is based, the PAC will vote for it.

Prof S M MAYATULA: Madam Speaker, let me just make a comment on  the  Budget
allocation for arms. I want us to  remember  that  war  does  not  come,  it
arrives, and we have to be prepared for it.
Education remains Government's first priority, and the current Budget  bears
testimony to that. In the financial year 1998-99 the  Education  budget  was
R45,348 billion, which in four years rose by R10 billion to R55,395  billion
in 2001-02. In one year it has again risen by R4 billion to R59,799  billion
this year, which is 24% of nonexpenditure interest.

Furthermore, the Education budget is expected to reach  R68,360  billion  by
the year 2004-05. Of the R59,799 billion, which relates to the total  amount
budgeted for education as a whole, only R8,804 billion is allocated  to  the
national Department of Education, and part of  that  is  channelled  to  the
provinces in the form of conditional grants.

I would like to highlight  some  of  these  programmes  and  their  possible
income impact on the lives of our people.  I  will  start  off  with  Higher
Education, which has been allocated the lion's share of R7,992  billion,  of
which R500 million is set aside for the  National  Students'  Financial  Aid
Scheme. This amount, which is R50 million more  than  last  year's,  if  one
includes the paybacks which will go up to about R700 million,  is  targeting
the poorest of the poor and continues to  open  the  doors  of  learning  to
those  who  would  otherwise  never  even  dream  of  setting  foot  in  the
institutions of higher learning.

I now turn  to  Financial  Management  and  Quality  Enhancement,  which  is
allocated a sum of R224,320 million, which will rise to R248,479 million  by
the year 2004-05. It is intended to  improve  financial  management  in  the
education system and also to improve the quality of  education  in  schools.
To me, those seem to be very important  items.  This  programme  will  bring
about improved school effectiveness  by  prioritising  district  and  school
management,  governance  development  and  teacher   development,   and   by
targeting the identified areas for rural development and urban renewal.

This project is going to lead to improved school  safety,  targeting  crimes
like drugs, vandalism and racism  and  also  introducing  youth  development
programmes  like  music,  sport,  culture  and  indigenous  games   in   our
communities. It will also lead to  improved  learner  participation  in  the
effective teaching of mathematics, science and  technology,  also  targeting
disadvantaged  female  learners  to  enter  gateway  subjects  and  critical
professions.

All these good programmes will come to nothing if our people do not  respond
positively to the President's call of Vukuzenzele. Those  schools  that  are
affected by vandalism and drugs, the districts that want  to  improve  their
school management systems, and  the  youths  who  want  to  be  involved  in
sports,  arts  and  cultural  activities  must  start  putting  their  heads
together  and  make  plans  to  access  these  funds.  Olungakhaliyo  lufela

Allow me to move to Early Childhood Development, which has been allocated  a
sum of R52 million, which is expected to rise to R88 million  next  year  to
provide children eligible for the reception year with access  to  a  quality
education  and  care  programme,  particularly  in  poor  communities.  This
programme  will  lead  to  3  000  licensed  Grade  R  participants,  3  000
registered community-based early child development sites,  90  000  learners
who are able to continue with their learning in the foundation phase, and  3
000 basic education kits of learning materials for each learning site.

We must remember that this is going to be a new move to our rural areas  and
it is going to change the current set-up whereby preschools are a  privilege
of the rich. The ANC Government is delivering.

With regard to HIV/Aids, as in education, I want  to  start  off  by  saying
that there is an unfortunate linking  of  prevention  of  Aids  purely  with
nevirapine. There is more to the prevention of Aids than nevirapine.

These are some of the projects that the Department of Education will  engage
in in that fight. Education has been allocated a sum of R142 million  -  and
last year this figure was only R63,5 million - to show  how  the  Government
is taking this HIV/Aids pandemic seriously in order to ensure access  to  an
appropriate and effective integrated system of prevention, care and  support
for children infected and affected by HIV/Aids, and to  deliver  life-skills
and HIV/Aids education in primary and secondary schools. This  project  will
lead to an additional 200 trained master  trainers;  an  additional  15  000
trained primary and secondary school teachers; and an implementation of  the
life-skills programmes  in  an  additional  35%  of  primary  and  secondary
schools.

Allow me to move to the  Thuba  Makote  schools  as  centres  for  community
development, which have been allocated a sum of R34 million in this  Budget,
which is expected to rise to  R64  million  next  year.  This  is  meant  to
develop and pilot a cost-effective approach to the design, construction  and
management of school facilities which will also meet the  development  needs
of rural communities. This project is directed to the rural  communities  in
order to  change  their  lives.  This  programme  will  go  a  long  way  in
implementing the President's  announcement  when  he  said  (Hansard  (Joint
sitting) 2002,  col  15):  ``Government  will  ...  allocate  the  necessary
resources to ensure that no child studies under a tree.''

This programme is going to  develop  27  schools  in  rural  areas  in  each
province, identified as being in the  greatest  need.  One  can  imagine  27
schools in each province! It  will  also  lead  to  proposals  for  18  more
schools and to the construction of 18 multifunctional schools. What  we  are
called upon to do as MPs and communities out  there  is  to  try  and  track
whether these things are happening and whether the budget is landing on  the
ground.

The last programme that I want to touch on is the national Ikhwelo  project,
which received a sum of R25 million last year and will now get R40  million,
which will rise to R50 million  next  year,  to  provide  access  to  skills
development and generally educating and training for  adult  learners.  When
we say adult basic education is important, we mean it  and  we  are  putting
funds towards that  to  enhance  their  social  and  economic  capacity.  In
concrete terms these  projects  will  lead  to  450  educators  or  trainers
employed to train adults in agriculture  and  SMME  learning  programmes  in
addition to literacy. That means there is an employment  that  is  going  to
come out  of  this.  Nine  thousand  adults  will  be  engaged  in  lifelong
learning.

Through this Budget, the ANC-led  Government  has  put  forward  a  plan  of
action for us all. In the name of  Vukuzenzele,  let  us  all  roll  up  our
sleeves and put our shoulders to the wheel.

The success of these programmes depends on the commitment of all our  people
to do their best. Wadsworth Longfellow put it  beautifully,  when  he  said:
``The talent of success is nothing more than doing what  you  can  do  well,
and doing well whatever you do.'' I think  our  Minister  of  Finance  is  a
typical example of that.

The  success  of  these  programmes  again  depends   on   our   spirit   of
volunteerism. As we give ourselves and our  time  to  these  tasks,  let  us
remember, according to Henry Ward Beecher: ``There was never  a  person  who
did anything worth doing that did not receive more than he gave.''

Let us go out and do something for our  communities,  not  to  be  paid  for
doing that, but for the good of doing those  things.  It  is  better  to  do
something for nothing than to do nothing for nothing. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF notes the perception of  progress  in
this country. We need to ensure more visibility on all the  positive  things
happening within South Africa, and doing that will instil a sense  of  pride
in the nation. This is by no means an easy  task  taking  into  account  the
escalating levels of poverty, unemployment and  crime.  People  need  to  be
informed that this is not a  gross  mismanagement  of  the  country,  but  a
creation of the past system by the apartheid regime.

When we look at the Budget, we can see that it is an  empowering  Budget,  a
people's Budget. Looking at the deficit now, compared to 20 years  ago  when
it was in double figures, it is an indication  of  the  country  being  well
managed. The people need to  realise  that  they  have  been  part  of  this
process due to greater public participation since the democratic  elections.
The MF finds it to be the duty of  all  parties,  the  House  and  the  many
organs of  government  to  be  part  of  this  whole  initiative  to  instil
confidence in our country.

The MF feels that the budget for the smaller parties should be increased  to
ensure that the parties become more effective, and  finds  that  the  budget
allocated to the parties represented at Parliament is inadequate.

Due to time restraints, the MF is unable to fully address the  Appropriation
Bill. Crime is the biggest threat to our new democracy. Thus, the MF  agrees
that the budget for Safety and Security is  a  priority.  To  address  crime
effectively, it is imperative that the money  be  allotted  in  a  fair  and
equitable manner, depending on the needs of the community.

Education and  training  are  of  major  importance  to  ensure  we  address
literacy and poverty in rural and urban areas. Taking account  of  the  vast
needs of the majority of the population, the budget allocated  to  Education
is approved, though the MF feels that to address the situation  effectively,
larger funding is needed.

The conditions of public hospitals  and  the  issue  of  Aids  need  serious
attention and much more resources to achieve  the  ends.  The  MF,  however,
applauds the efforts in primary health care. The Department  of  Transport's
new approach of interacting is welcomed by the MF. The Housing  department's
achievements fall far short of expectations. It must  be  congratulated  for
its effort to meet the challenges, and visibility is necessary so  that  the
thousands on the waiting list realise that efforts to  address  the  problem
are being made, and that houses cannot fall from the sky.

The MF supports the Appropriation Bill  and  congratulates  the  department,
headed by the hon the Finance Minister, Dr  Trevor  Manuel,  on  the  fiscal
discipline and plan. From the Minority Front, congratulations! [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, two  tertiary  institutions  were  so  impressed
with the hon the Minister's Budget that both of  them  awarded  an  honorary
doctorate  to  the  now  Dr  Manuel.  Who  am  I  then  to   criticise   ...
[Interjections.] He  has  three?  Well,  then  let  us  upgrade  him  to  an
automatic! [Laughter.]

On the income side of this Budget, R15 billion in  tax  reductions  will  be
spread over the whole spectrum which, in turn,  will  stimulate  saving  and
investment, with growth and job creation as a probable result.  A  reduction
in tax for companies was also on the shopping list of the AEB. That did  not
materialise, but would have led to more investment from abroad. With  regard
to  the  expenditure,  the  increased  spending  on  capital  projects   and
infrastructure will stimulate growth  and  job  creation.  The  increase  in
social pensions, although less than expected, is also applauded, as well  as
the fact that the Minister did not give in to popular pressure for  a  basic
social grant. The AEB is definitely not singing together with  the  PAC  and
the DP in this socialistic choir.

Behind the generally well accepted Budget lies an  economic  philosophy.  In
this regard President Mbeki, an economist himself,  recently  wrote  in  ANC
Today that, unlike other liberated countries in  Africa,  South  Africa  has
embarked on the long and disciplined road to delivery and  development  with
own capital, and not the easy way of unsustainable  quick-start  development
and delivery with money borrowed from overseas. This is not always  popular,
but it  is  sustainable.  Thus,  with  regard  to  economic  discipline  and
macroeconomic   policies,   South   Africa   has   distanced   itself   from
irresponsible behaviour in Africa.

My vraag vandag is: Waarom  kan  hierdie  volwasse,  nugtere  en  volhoubare
benadering nie deurgetrek word na alle aspekte van regering nie?  Waarom  so
bang, as dit kom by beleidsaspekte soos die  handhawing  van  die  regstaat,
van demokratiese beginsels, van die vertrapping van menseregte, om  dan  ook
duidelik aan die wêreld te sê: In Suid-Afrika doen ons dit anders? In  Suid-
Afrika distansieer ons onsself ondubbelsinnig van vergrype van tiranne  soos
die huidig onwettig verkose president van Zimbabwe.

Kom ons plaas Suid-Afrika in alle opsigte in 'n liga van sy eie, in 'n  liga
wat die mooiste van Afrika sy eie maak en  nie  die  averse  nie.  In  Suid-
Afrika gaan ons eie unieke oplossings uitdink sodat korrupsie nek  omgedraai
word, sodat elke  bevolkingsgroep  sy  eie  kan  handhaaf,  sy  kinders  kan
onderrig volgens sy  eie  waarde  en  etos,  sy  gemeenskapsinstellings  kan
handhaaf, volkshelde se name nie net  op  monumente  nie  maar  ook  by  die
ingange van ons dorpe kan  aanskou.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[My question today is: Why can this mature, sober and  sustainable  approach
not be applied to all aspects of government? Why are we so afraid,  when  it
comes  to  policy  aspects  like  upholding  the  rule  of  law,  democratic
principles, trampling  of  human  rights,  to  tell  the  world  loudly  and
clearly: In South Africa we  do  things  differently?  In  South  Africa  we
distance ourselves unequivocally from the  transgressions  of  tyrants  like
the current illegally chosen president of Zimbabwe.

Let us place South Africa in a league of its own in every aspect,  one  that
makes the most beautiful of Africa its own and not the  opposite.  In  South
Africa, we are going to come up  with  our  own  unique  solutions  to  stop
corruption in its tracks, so that each population group can  hold  its  own,
teach its children according  to  its  own  values  and  ethos,  uphold  its
community  institutions,  observe  its  folk  heroes'  names  not  only   on
monuments, but also at the entrances to our towns.]

The AEB, politically incorrect as it may be, will support  this  Budget  and
does so  with  this  urgent  appeal:  Let  us  apply  the  same  discipline,
uniqueness and our very own type of excellence in  every  sphere  of  public
and private life. Let the hallmark of a winning country not be limited to  a
once-a-year budget, but let it extend to every  sphere  of  life,  province,
state department, office and teacher.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, let me just  finish.  [Laughter.]  Let  the  whole
world then take notice. South Africa may never be the victim  of  collective
punishment, because, as Frank Sinatra said, we do it our way. [Applause.]

Ms S B NQODI: Chairperson and hon members, the annual Budget is a  political
instrument, which members of this House use to hold  Government  accountable
for the way in which it manages the taxpayers' money.  Through  our  ongoing
constitutional obligation of the review and scrutiny of the Budget,  we  are
able to take informed political decisions  that  can  assist  Government  to
make wise, progressive and responsible political choices.

I can say without any hesitation that the Budget for the fiscal  year  under
consideration in this debate satisfies this assertion. It is indeed a  well-
organised, well-planned and target-focused policy  document  which  empowers
us  with  sufficient  information   that   illustrates   this   Government's
commitment to improving the quality of life of the people of this country.

Furthermore, it enables us to monitor progress in policy  implementation  by
all spheres of government through the detailed illustration  and  tabulation
of the vertical and horizontal division of revenue.  With  such  a  powerful
instrument at our disposal we are confident of delivering  as  expected  the
political mandate that we carry from the people that we  represent  in  this
House.

Before I make any input in this debate, I wish to  highlight  the  following
facts. The latest report by Statistics SA estimates that our population  has
grown to approximately 45 million. The demographic realities  indicate  that
almost 87% of these people are Africans, the majority  of  whom  live  below
the poverty datum line, because they are unemployed,  illiterate,  unskilled
and homeless. Because of these facts they  are  the  most  vulnerable  group
exposed to all forms of social ills and problems.

Whereas, under the past regime,  the  majority  of  these  people  were  not
counted in the country's census records, since 1996 the  ANC-led  Government
has made sure that they are counted in  also.  The  same  happened  in  last
year's national census. Given this truth it is important, therefore, for  us
in this House to know that the Budget of  this  Government  is  informed  by
these new statistical records. The big slices of the Budget cake which  used
to be cut for the benefit  and  enjoyment  of  life  of  a  handful  of  our
population, due to the racial and discriminatory policies, now  have  to  be
shared by all of us in this country, irrespective of who we are.

The unfortunate consequence is that this  Government  has  to  allocate  the
national Budget  in  such  a  way  that  it  takes  into  consideration  the
political, socioeconomic and historical background of the masses of  people.
Definitely, if we understand democracy, this Budget  and  the  next  one  to
follow after this have to be pro-poor.
The analysis of this Budget indicates a great shift of  resource  allocation
from the national Government to the two delivery  arms  of  government,  the
provincial and the local spheres, through the  equitable  share  allocations
and the unconditional  and  conditional  grants.  The  bigger  transfer,  as
noted, goes  to  the  provincial  sphere  of  government.  This  is  welcome
because, as we all  know,  according  to  the  constitutional  dictates  and
obligation, this is the sphere of government  responsible  for  most  social
spending.

The increase  in  nonconditional  and  conditional  grants  will  definitely
enable  provinces  to  deliver  expediently  in  areas   of   infrastructure
development, education and  skills  development,  health,  housing  and  job
creation and increase the amount for the  old  age  pension,  child  support
grants and care-dependency grants.

The biggest increase in the Budget goes  to  the  local  government  sphere.
This is also highly commendable, since  this  is  the  sphere  charged  with
delivery of basic services and provision of  infrastructure,  especially  to
the poorest areas of our communities.

Residents are dependent on these newly  demarcated  municipalities  to  roll
out  essential  services  and  infrastructure.  Government  is   once   more
commended  for  an  extra  boost  of  funds,  which  seeks  to  help   those
municipalities  which  fall  within  the  nodes  identified  in  the   rural
development and urban renewal programmes. The growth in the housing  subsidy
allocations for this sphere is also noted in  the  Budget.  It  is  expected
that the  new  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Act  will
further relieve those municipalities which have a small tax base  and  which
remain poor because of the deliberate  underdevelopment  strategies  of  the
past governments.

Again, the increase in the amount of conditional  grants  to  municipalities
for  infrastructure  and  institutional  restructuring   and   capacity   is
welcomed. Hopefully, this will improve skills in  financial  management  and
accountability  through  the  training  that  both  the  officials  and  the
councillors who serve in these structures definitely need.

Details of the national departments'  spending  plans  for  the  next  three
years, as said in the estimates of national expenditure,  clearly  underline
this Government's  commitment  to  accelerated  transformation  and  change,
economic growth enhancement,  job  creation,  deepening  equity  and  social
development, especially of our previously  marginalised  and  underdeveloped
communities, and the strengthening of the safety and justice sector.

In conclusion, I wish to reassure the  House  that  the  ANC-led  Government
remains as truthful and committed to our  popular  and  consistent  election
campaign slogan that says, ``A better life for all.'' We said this  in  1994
and in the 1999 elections. This is what actually made us win  the  elections
by a landslide.

The  political  mandate  that  we  carry  in  this  House  is  enormous  and
challenging, and the stakes are high. The achievements of the  ANC  in  this
House need to be perceived and judged in relation to  the  endless  list  of
backlogs that  we  inherited  from  the  apartheid  regime,  especially  the
servicing of a huge national debt which we found ourselves  confronted  with
in 1995.

We should realise that up to today the very same debt  constitutes  more  or
less the second largest experience of this Government,  absorbing  almost  a
fifth of our Budget as indicated  in  the  past  budgets.  Because  of  this
Government's  prudent  fiscal   management   policy,   outstanding   revenue
performance and the outstanding improvement of tax collection  by  Sars,  we
have reduced Government dissaving, interest expenditure and debt.

Our people are beginning to benefit from the spin-offs of this sound  fiscal
policy. The message conveyed to our electorate through this Budget  is  that
with their support and the loyalty they displayed in the last  election,  we
are  determined  to  accelerate  change  as  we  promised  in  our  election
manifesto for  this  second  term  of  our  democratic  Government.  We  are
beginning to level the playing field,  to  discover  the  keys  to  treasure
boxes that were  hidden  from  us  by  those  who  resisted  change  in  the
Government of National Unity.

The time has come - I would like to say to  Comrade  Trevor  -  to  give  to
Caesar what belongs to him. I want to say to the majority of our people  out
there to seize the opportunity that will be  granted  to  them  through  our
black economic empowerment and SMME  programmes,  so  that  they,  too,  can
begin to enjoy the benefits of the riches that were created by  our  fathers
and mothers. They must be warned, however, that  they  do  not  have  to  be
hired because of the colour of their skin. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, because of the constraints of time I  will
be not be able to congratulate my dear  friend  on  having  been  awarded  a
doctorate. This year's Budget is inspiring in some respects.  Indeed,  those
who are employed have benefited from the tax cuts.  Azapo  understands  that
the aim of a country's budget proposal is to stimulate economic  growth  and
to enable the citizens of a  country  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  economic
growth and expansion.

Tax cuts, which will benefit close to about 11,8  million  employed  people,
are indeed a step in the right direction. However,  there  are  limitations,
which we want to point out, to the Budget.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, could  you  please  lower
your voices. I cannot hear what this member is saying from the podium  here.
Continue, hon member.

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: The encouraging  steps  in  the  right  direction  are,
however, negated by the rising interest rates  that  were  effected  at  the
beginning of the year. Let us hope that interest rates will not rise  again.
Coupled with the rising food prices, we have a situation  which  might  lead
to one step forward, two steps backward.

This year's Budget has not, in fact, offered much to the unemployed  of  our
country. Given  the  South  African  situation  in  which  the  majority  of
unemployed people are black, we can therefore predict that the  increase  in
child and old  age  grants  will  simply  disappear  in  the  midst  of  the
unemployed fathers and mothers or, in some instances,  be  shared  with  the
extended family members.

Solidarity with the poor,  which  the  Minister  has  indicated,  will  mean
recognising, therefore, the poor's financial  institutions  and  encouraging
these institutions to grow. Solidarity,  in  these  circumstances,  lies  in
recognising and formalising these institutions so that the  money  the  poor
have gained can be saved in institutions of their own, without their  having
to depend on the institutions of the rich which do not grant them credit.

The allocation of R1,5 billion for poverty  alleviation  is  an  encouraging
sign indeed, but judged against the 30% unemployment rate, it  is,  however,
not enough. Job creation is fundamental if we  hope  to  alleviate  poverty.
[Time expired.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, Minister, hon members, the  welcome  tax  relief
in  this  Budget  and  the   repeated   near-Gregorian   chants   that   our
microeconomic fundamentals  are  sound,  must  not  obscure  the  fact  that
underlying questions of credibility and confidence need to be interrogated.

If we wish to find the missing  ingredient  holding  our  economy  back,  we
cannot  shy  away  from  these  questions.  Clearly,  they  have   political
undertones and it is therefore not surprising to  find  them  excluded  from
the Myburgh commission's brief. Instead of being in  second  gear,  in  more
than one sense we appear to be stuck in neutral  at  best.  [Interjections.]
Yes, Minister Manuel, neutral. Despite 11 September,  which  has  become  an
ill-advisedly abused alibi for many ills, including domestic  ones,  the  US
economy is showing flickers of  a  strong  recovery,  according  to  Federal
Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan. One  hopes  the  global  economy  will  follow
suit. We require some bold steps of our own, primarily  greater  confidence-
building, to place this country on an accelerated growth path.

We are simply not reaching the levels of growth that  we  require.  We  have
squandered some of our  key  opportunities  to  capitalise  on  good  market
conditions in telecommunications and aviation. We have spent  money  far  in
excess of what we can afford in the Strategic Defence Procurement.

As I indicated, we have lost out because our privatisation process has  been
slow  and  inappropriate  in  many  respects.  We  have  seen  this  in  the
telecommunications sector, and with pre-September 11 cracks in the  aviation
sector also showing in this sector. As a consequence of the Telkom  and  SAA
IPO delays, we  have  found  seemingly  reasonable  sounding  alibis.  These
alibis cannot obscure the missed opportunities. To compound the SAA case  we
had to pay a turnaround specialist an exorbitant  severance  package  before
the conclusion of his contract, only to have to reacquire SAA from  Swissair
and overturn key acquisition decisions at further substantive  cost  to  the
taxpayer.

While  we  have  seen  recent  announcements  on  Turbomeca  Africa  Safcol,
Spoornet and Eskom, these post-Budget Speech developments must  not  obscure
the nondelivery by the Minister of Public Enterprises. The hon the  Minister
set a target of R18 billion in last year's budget. The hon the  Minister  of
Public Enterprises met it with R4,3 billion out of the  deals  that  do  not
amount to privatisation: the special Sasria dividend and the  M-Cell  shares
that are literally parked on ice.

These post-Budget steps cannot  obscure  the  fact  that  our  privatisation
process has been slow and inappropriate, raising the issue  of  whether  the
choice of strategic equity partnerships is, indeed, a sound choice,  because
it walks the middle ground between eking out foreign direct  investment  and
attempting  to  retain  control  in  Government   hands   over   state-owned
enterprises at all costs.

The estimates of expenditure confirmed that the arms deal  costs  now  stand
at R52,7 billion.  This,  the  Minister  knows  as  well  as  I  do,  is  an
underestimate and does not fully reflect the additional burden of  financing
and interest payments. This  is  well  above  original  estimates  of  R30,3
billion, with annual payments peaking in 2005-06.
In a supreme exercise of the art of  euphemism,  the  Minister  stated  that
increases of the Defence vote will provide for the higher costs of the  arms
deal to revised exchange rate projections. This is indeed a euphemism.

We have an acquisition cost with no ceiling, with exchange  rate  volatility
in the driver's seat and not the National Treasury. This is clear  from  two
contrasting Business Day headlines of 17 and 19 November, and I  would  like
to highlight them. The headline of 17 November 1998 reads: ``Threat to  arms
package.'' In this article the Minister of Finance's reservations  are  well
recorded: ``Manuel is understood to be opposed to  new  borrowing  of  about
R7,5  billion  over  15  years,  which  acceptance  of  the  package   would
require.''

Two days later, the Minister was overruled by his  Cabinet  colleagues.  The
headline of 19 November 1998 reads: ``Arms deal  approved  despite  Manuel's
reservations.  [Interjections.]  Yes,  the  hon  the  Minister  was   indeed
overruled  by  his  colleagues.  He  was  in  the  one  corner  fighting  on
affordability, and  Mr  Erwin,  Mr  Modise  and,  indeed,  the  then  Deputy
President were in the other  corner.  The  Minister  of  Finance  lost  that
battle  and  that  is  why  exchange  rate  volatility  is  in  this   seat.
[Interjections.]

This is the March  deadline  for  the  second  tranche  on  the  arms  deal.
[Interjections.] I ask the Minister of Finance today: Is he yet again  going
to be overruled and make a trade-off with the Ministers who favour the  arms
deal, or is he going to act in the public  interest  and  cut  back  on  the
second tranche? That is the only answer we want in March. [Applause.]

Adv S P HOLOMISA: Mhlalingaphambili namalungu abekekileyo,  ndivumeleni  nam
ndongeze  kula  mazwi  okuvuyisana  nomzukulwana  kaManuel  ngeembasa   athe

Umlungu, njengoko nisazi, wasiphathela indlala, satsho safa saphela  zizifo.
Uqale  wasohluthela  umhlaba,   wanciphisa   iinkomo   zethu,   wasinyanzela
ngeerhafu, satsho sanyanzeleka ukuba  sisebenzele  yena.  Singamahlwempu  xa
kungoku. Izicwangciso zenkqubo yeSebe lezoLimo nemiCimbi yoMhlaba  zisekelwe
ukubuyisa umva le meko yobuhlwempu nendlala.

ISebe  lezoLimo  nemiCimbi  yoMhlaba  limaxhaphetshu  libuyisela  kubaniniwo
umhlaba abawuhluthelwayo,  neyookhokho  babo,  ukusukela  ngonyaka  ka-1913.
Lixakekile likhusela  abo  bahleli  kwiifama  zabelungu  ukuze  bangagxothwa
ngesinyolokotho  kwimizana  yamagxamesi  abahlala   kuyo.   Kwa   eli   sebe
aliphumlanga, lilungiselela ukwaba ngokutsha  umhlaba  osezandleni  zombuso,
lisabela  abo  badinga  umhlaba  owarhwaphilizwa   ngabelungu.   Zonke   ezi
zicwangciso ke, umhlekazi omhle,  ugqirha  Manuel,  uCihoshe  makayazi  into
yokuba zifuna imali. ... Ingathi uQhudeni uyamphazamisa  phaya  ...  Kuthiwa
khupha imali ukuze wenze imali.

Uhlenga-hlengiso  lomhlaba  yinkqubo  efanelwe   kukuba   yenziwe   igqitywe
ngexesha elithile. Kungoko ke bekunga  ingagalelwa  kangangoko  imali  kweli
Sebe, ukuze likwazi ukuthi emva kweminyaka  emithathu  liwubuyisele  umhlaba
kubaniniwo, libafumanele  umhlaba  bonke  abahleli  ngempundw'enye  kwiifama
zabelungu. Xa kunokuthi kube njalo, abantu  bakuthi  baya  kuvuka  bazenzele
ngenene, babe ``ngoophila kukuzenzela''.

Le nkqubo yokwabiwa komhlaba ngokutsha ihambisana  ncakasana  naleyo  yeSebe
lezoLimo nemiCimbi yoMhlaba  yokulwa  indlala  nokuvelisa  ukutya.  Njengoko
sikhokelwe ngamakhosikazi kweli Sebe, eli Sebe liyayilwa into  yokuba  ikati
ilale   eziko.   Izicwangciso   zalo   ezininzi   zikhuthaza    ukungenelela
kwamakhosikazi kumsebenzi wolimo nemfuyo.

Ngomhlaba  ngamnye  okhutshwayo  kuqinisekiswa  into   yokuba   amakhosikazi
ayaxhamla kuwo. La makhosikazi ayaqeqeshwa ukuze  abe  nezakhono  zokuwulima
nokunonelela imfuyo leyo abangaba banayo. Bafundiswa ukuba bayile  amaqumrhu
okuba bahlanganise izinto abanazo khon' ukuze bazuze imveliso  ethe  xhaxhe.
Lilima ke elo. [Uwele-wele]

Umhlaba uwodwa awukwazi kuvelisa ndyebo.  Umhlaba  ufuna  izixhobo  zokulima
ezinjengeeteletele,   imatshini   zokunkcenkceshela,   izichumiso    nocingo
lokubiya.  Isabelo  seSebe  lezoLimo   nemiCimbi   yoMhlaba   masithabathele
ingqalelo ezo zidingo ukuze bakwazi abantu bakuthi ukuziphilisa.

Amafama arhweba ngolimo ayakhala ngedizili. Athi noko  ebulela  ngomnyinyiva
aphiwa wona,  le  irhafu  iseleyo  kwidizili  isawenza  umthwalo  ube  nzima
kakhulu. Kubeka phi ke kwizikhwabazi zamahlwempu  endlu  emnyama.  Sithi  ke
ngoko, okaManuel makenze icebo. Sithe kaloku  kuthiwa  kuphuma  imali  ukuze
kungene imali.

Ekuqaleni phaya, sithe umhlaba  wethu  esiwulimayo  mncinci  kakhulu  ngenxa
yorhwaphilizo lwamandulo. Noko kunjalo, usenayo intwana  yamafutha  okuwenza
ube nemveliso. Iphulo leli Sebe  lezoLimo  nemiCimbi  yoMhlaba  kukukhuthaza
amawethu ukuba aziqhelise ukulima iintlobo ngeentlobo  zezityalo  ngamaxesha
onke onyaka, bafuye iintlobo ngeentlobo zemfuyo, ende  nemfutshane.  Lingena
apha  ke  igalelo  lamaqumrhu   ophando   nophuhliso,   anjenge-Agricultural
Research  Council,  iOnderstepoort   Biological   Products   neOnderstepoort
Veterinary  Institute.  Ngobuchule  bala  maqumrhu  amawethu   aya   kukwazi
ukukhetha izityalo ezifanele imihlaba yawo, bawazi  amayeza  okuseza  imfuyo
yabo.

Ngexesha besityelele komkhulu, ePitoli ekuqaleni kwalo uphezulu,  siyiKomiti
yezoLimo  nemiCimbi  yoMhlaba,  bakhale  kakhulu  abaphathi  bala   maqumrhu
besithi, noko inkxaso abayifumanayo inganeno kakhulu  kuneemfuno  neemfanelo
zabo. Iingcaphephe  ziyemka  zisiya  kufuna  amathafa  aluhlaza.  Siyaphinda
kwakho, siyacela ukuba isabelo sawo lamaqumrhu sithi nyi noko.

Sidume  kakhulu  kulo  lonke  eli  leAfrika  nangaphandle  ngokuba  phambili
kumanyathelo ophando nophuhliso kangangokuba abathengi  abaninzi,  bemveliso
yawo, baphuma kwelasemzini. Masingayivumeli yeyele nto zakuthi.

Zonke ezi  zicwangciso  ziya  kuba  lilize  phofu  ukuba  la  masebe  mabini
kaNkosikazi Didiza ayayekelwa ngalawo oogxa bakhe. Intsebenziswano  phakathi
kwamasebe ngamasebe ingundoqo ukuze liphumelele iphulo lokuliwa kwendlala.

Sicela  amanzi  okunkcenkceshela  kwiSebe  lemiCimbi   yaManzi   namaHlathi,
iindlela  ezihambekayo  kweleMisebenzi  yoLuntu,  amathuba  angawo   orhwebo
kwiSebe  loRhwebo  neMveliso,  ukuze  imveliso  yethu   ixhamle   kwiimalike
zasemzini,  amalungelo  afanelekileyo   kubasebenzi   ezifama   kweli   Sebe
lezaBasebenzi nakuwo  onke  amanye  ukuze  uphuhliso  lube  loluza  kwendela
lungapheleli esithubeni. Ewe ke kwelemali isebe, sicela imali.

Sizimisele ke  ngoko,  singamalungu  e-ANC  ukuba  sisebenze  bade  bangqine
abantu bakuthi kulo uzayo unyaka bathi `wagwetywa ndlala'.  Njengoko  nisazi
siyi-ANC  siyaluxhasa  olu  lwabiwo-mali.  [Kwaqhwatywa]   (Translation   of
isiXhosa speech follows.)

[Adv S P HOLOMISA: Chairperson and hon members, please allow  me  to  add  a
few words and congratulate the grandchild  of  the  Manuel  family  for  the
awards that he received from institutions of higher learning in the  Western
Cape. As a newly honoured doctor we are certain that,  Cihoshe,  as  I  hear
them call him, will help lift the standard  of  the  rand  that  is  falling
right now.

It is with pleasure that I am standing before you this afternoon so  that  I
could also contribute a few words towards this discussion about this  year's
Appropriation Bill.

During this year of Vukuzenzele,  the  year  of  united  social  action  and
volunteerism, to us villagers this brings  joy  when  there  is  talk  about
working for ourselves. We have always  worked  for  the  white  man  without
witnessing any positive results. This campaign reminds us  of  the  previous
time when we used to grow crops on our fields and look after  our  livestock
so that we could feed our families without going to look for work  from  the
white man. During that time we had oxen,  gardens  and  large  fields  which
produced substantially and on which we used manure,  whilst  young  children
sucked milk of newly calved cows and sourmilk.

The white man, as you know, brought us hunger and that led to  us  dying  in
large numbers because of diseases. First, he dispossessed us  of  our  land,
reduced the number of our cattle, forced us to pay  taxes,  and  because  of
that we were forced to work  for  him.  We  are  poor  as  it  is  now.  The
programmes  of  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  are  a
mechanism of alleviating hunger and poverty.

The Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs is busy with the  process  of
giving back land that was forcefully taken away from  its  rightful  owners,
even that of their forefathers, dating back to the year 1913. On  the  other
hand it is protecting those that reside on white-owned farms against  forced
evictions from the outfarms they live in. The same department  is  preparing
to distribute state-owned land that was previously taken  by  white  people,
amongst those that are in need of it.  The  hon  Dr  Manuel,  Cihoshe,  must
know, therefore, that all these things  need  money.  It  seems  Qhudeni  is
disturbing over there. It is said, give out money in order to make more.

Land reform has to be finished within  a  certain  timeframe.  That  is  why
there is the wish that there should be a substantial amount  of  money  that
is allocated to this Department, so that at the  end  of  three  years  land
restitution would be complete, and that those that are  not  really  welcome
in white-owned farms would be given land of their own. If things could  work
out like that, our people  would  wake  up,  stand  up  and  do  things  for
themselves, and be called "those who live by doing for themselves".

This process of land redistribution goes hand in hand with the objective  of
the Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs of fighting hunger  and  that
of producing food. As  we  have  women  leaders  in  this  Department,  this
Department's aim  is  to  fight  against  hunger.  Most  of  its  programmes
encourage women to participate in farming.

With each piece of land that is given out it is  ensured  that  women  enjoy
the benefits. These women are trained so that  they  could  gain  skills  of
growing crops and rear livestock that they might have. They  are  taught  to
form joint teams or agricultural corporations in which  they  would  combine
their resources so that they could have more production.  That  is  a  joint
team.

The land by itself cannot produce. The land needs farming equipment such  as
tractors, irrigation  machinery,  fertilizers  and  wire  for  fencing.  The
budget allocated to the Department of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  must
take into consideration  those  needs  so  that  our  people  can  fend  for
themselves.
Agricultural farmers are  complaining  about  diesel.  They  say  that  they
appreciate the slight reduction, but tax on diesel still makes it  difficult
for them. How much more difficult can that be with the poorest of  the  poor
in the black nation. We say, therefore, that the son  of  the  Manuels  must
devise a plan. By the way, we say money must go out in  order  for  more  to
come in.

In the beginning, we said our agricultural land is very  little  because  of
corruption in the past. In spite of that, it  still  has  a  little  bit  of
richness to enable it  to  produce.  The  campaign  of  this  Department  of
Agriculture and Land Affairs is to encourage  our  people  to  get  used  to
ploughing different kinds of crops at all seasons and  farm  with  different
types of livestock. This is where  the  contribution  of  the  research  and
development  teams  such  as  the   Agricultural   Research   Council,   the
Onderstepoort Biological Products  and  Onderstepoort  Veterinary  Institute
come in. Through the expertise of the teams, our  people  will  be  able  to
choose crops that are suitable  for  their  type  of  soil  and  know  which
medicines are suitable for their livestock.

When we, as the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture and  Land  Affairs,  were
visiting to the Union Buildings in Pretoria at the beginning of  this  year,
the directors of these teams complained very much saying  that  the  support
they are getting was not enough for their needs and wants. Experts leave  to
seek greener pastures. We repeat our request that the  budget  allocated  to
these teams be increased a little.

We are popular in the whole of the African continent because we lead in  the
research and development initiatives in so much that a number  of  consumers
of their production are from outside South Africa. Let us not  let  it  sink
my people.

All these programmes will be pointless if  the  hon  Minister  Didiza's  two
departments are just left to be by themselves by those  of  his  colleagues.
Co-operation between different departments is essential  in  order  for  the
campaign against hunger and poverty to be successful.

We ask for water for irrigation from the Department  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry; roads that are in good condition from  the  Department  of  Public
Works; favourable trading opportunities from the  Department  of  Trade  and
Industry, so that our production can  benefit  from  international  markets;
granting of rights or farmworkers from the Department of Labour and  to  all
the  others,  so  that  development  could  deep-rooted  and  not  just  end
anywhere. And yes, from the Department of Finance we ask for money.

We are committed, therefore, as ANC members to work very  hard  to  such  an
extent that our people would agree in the  following  year  and  say,  `away
with hunger'. As  you  know,  we  as  the  ANC  support  this  budget  vote.
[Applause.]]

Mr N J GOGOTYA: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: We  notice  that,  with
regard to certain political parties, there is a 100% absence in  the  House.
Azapo is  literally  100%  absent.  [Interjections.]  We  seek  clarity,  Mr
Chairperson, as to whether they have permission to be 100% absent.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That is not a  point  of  order.  Just
take your seat, please.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Mr Chairperson, there are  only  a  few  opportunities
every year for members to discuss general political issues. Today is such  a
day.

In view of the serious state of affairs in the country,  we  should  try  to
find common ground from where we, as a Parliament,  could  tackle  the  real
and dangerous issues confronting our land and its  peoples.  Serious  issues
such as  unemployment,  poverty,  HIV/Aids  and  crime  take  no  notice  of
political affiliation. Supporters of all political parties are hit by  these
monsters. The same is the case with race, gender and wealth. Rich  and  poor
people are all targeted.

We are therefore obliged to sit here, all of us, to  devise  a  strategy  in
which we all participate, a strategy which will lead to the  eradication  of
poverty and crime, a strategy which will ensure employment  for  our  people
and a strategy which will defend us against HIV/Aids.  We  should  therefore
apply our minds and devise creative strategies, and all of  us  should  join
hands to execute those strategies. There is no other way forward if  we  are
serious about destroying these dangers facing our land and its peoples.
We need to offer opinions and also criticise. We should tolerate  criticism.
We should encourage open-hearted discussion. We should also demonstrate  the
capacity to absorb criticism.

However, to be successful we also need to budget carefully.

Looking at the Budget, therefore, I noticed that the  hon  the  Minister  of
Finance indicated that  his  Budget  provided  for  almost  every  need  and
aspiration of our people, our country and our economy. However, he  admitted
to two shortfalls that his Budget does not effectively address.

The first shortfall is that he does not have enough  measures  to  stimulate
economic growth. Secondly, he does not  have  enough  measures  to  generate
employment. The core words therefore are ``growth'' and  ``employment''.  As
for the rest, the Budget distributes the economic  resources  of  our  state
across the board of all line functions, maintaining  an  even  keel  on  our
Government ship.

I really wonder whether in the waters we are now traversing we  should  keep
an even keel, or whether the time has not come to put our sailboat  in  full
speed, accepting that every now and then it might keel to one or  the  other
side. If we want to catch the winds, we must have the courage  to  tilt  the
boat in the right direction and fill our souls with the strength we need  to
move ahead in our journey towards overcoming the hurdles in our way,  moving
onwards to prosperity and stability. If we continue to operate in this  way,
trying to avoid catching the winds, our boat will remain in  the  middle  of
the ocean, far away from any port of safety.

There is little wrong with what is in the  Budget.  There  is  little  wrong
with many things the Government is doing, but there is,  however,  criticism
of what is not in the Budget and there is criticism of what  our  Government
is not doing.

The two things our country needs most are effective, courageous -  yes,  and
why not - drastic measures to promote  employment  and  more  employment  to
stimulate growth, growth, growth. Therefore, one cannot please  everyone  at
the same time.  We  must  choose  growth  and  employment  over  conflicting
interests. One cannot promote growth and please  the  trade  unions  at  the
same  time.  One  cannot  promote  employment  and  maintain  the  type   of
legislation which effectively prevents people from acquiring jobs and  takes
away all the incentives that any employer may have about hiring people.

We must also face a hard and shocking fact, which we,  unfortunately  cannot
deny. That is that in the past 10 years, our employment rate  has  decreased
dramatically, so much so that today we are one of  the  countries  with  the
largest unemployment rate anywhere in the world. We only  need  to  look  at
the recently released Global Competitiveness Report  of  Harvard  University
and the World Economic Forum, to see that our  macroeconomic  profile  ranks
at the very bottom of the 75 countries that are reviewed in the  report.  We
must do something constructive about this.

The same report outlines how our country excels, but not in aspects such  as
our enormous rate of corruption by public officials, incompetence by  public
officials and difficulty in doing business in South Africa. I say this  with
no pleasure, but actually with a degree of pain. The point is  that  all  we
want is for our country to work, to be effective and to be productive.

I wish to return to the  dangerous  issues  confronting  us.  The  first  is
unemployment. The official unemployment rate is  around  27%  of  employable
South Africans, but the unofficial rate is between 30% and 35%. A  third  of
our people do not have work. What can we do? The IFP says, firstly, that  we
have to create the conditions in which private  business  will  flourish  by
investing in new and existing industries and enterprises.  This  environment
is created by making our labour laws more  flexible  and  conducive  to  job
creation, especially for the small business sector.

Secondly, the IFP says that we have to launch special job creation  projects
in certain sectors of the  economy,  such  as  agriculture  and  small-scale
mining.

Thirdly, we have to provide incentives for companies to employ more  people,
such as tax incentives or additional tax rebates.

Talking about Aids, the national rate of infection is around 20%. This is  a
monster confronting this country. What can we do? The  IFP  says  we  should
provide antiretroviral drugs to all pregnant mothers. This will  save  about
30% of the babies born with the HI virus. Secondly, the IFP says  we  should
provide intensive counselling services to people living with Aids.

Thirdly, we should launch a national awareness  programme  that  unprotected
sex leads to HIV/Aids. Uganda and Malawi were  spectacularly  successful  in
their awareness campaigns. Fifthly, we should convince  the  ANC  Government
to change its stance, because its  position  is  detrimental  to  the  fight
against HIV/Aids.

Dealing briefly with crime, violent crime such as  murder,  rape  and  armed
robbery have decreased in the past few years, but the levels  of  crime  are
still far too high. What can we do? The IFP says, firstly,  that  we  should
implement an approach of zero tolerance to  all  crime.  Regardless  of  the
severity of the crime, the system must be seen to punish the  offender.  The
city of New York was very successful with  the  zero-tolerance  approach  in
which small, petty crimes were dealt with first, and  later  on  the  larger
crimes.

Secondly, the IFP says police investigators  should  be  better  trained  so
that more  cases  can  be  successfully  prosecuted  in  the  court  system.
Thirdly, the IFP says the court system  should  also  be  strengthened.  Too
many  criminals  are  walking  free  because  the  system   is   overloaded,
underresourced and unable to obtain successful prosecutions.  Fourthly,  the
IFP says the system of incarceration should be improved  so  that  criminals
pay  their  debt  to  society,  but  still  have  the  opportunity   to   be
rehabilitated.

Regarding poverty, the IFP  believes  that  poverty  can  only  be  attacked
through  a  combination  of  strategies.  Among  these  strategies  are  job
creation,  clean  living   conditions,   affordable   housing,   electricity
provision, social insurance, medical intervention in diseases  such  as  TB,
cholera and HIV/Aids, and food programmes. The most important point is  that
dealing with  poverty  cannot  be  limited  to  one  programme  or  specific
intervention only, but rather that there should be a  comprehensive  attack.
It should be composed of a comprehensive strategy that  covers  all  of  the
above aspects in general.

In conclusion, the bottom line for all of us is  to  restore  confidence  in
South Africa. We have lost the  confidence  of  the  world  because  of  our
inability  to  deal  effectively  with  the  major  and   dangerous   issues
confronting and threatening us. If a person has money overseas and wants  to
invest it, he will invest it in a hundred other countries before  he  brings
it to South Africa with all the problems we have.

Mortally dangerous  issues  such  as  poverty,  Aids,  unemployment,  crime,
strikes, the absence  of  work  ethics,  and  others,  prevent  people  from
investing in this country. An investor will not invest his or her  money  in
a country which cannot deal effectively  with  these  dangers.  The  central
message therefore, not only for myself but for all of us, is  that  we  have
to restore confidence in our country.

Ms L MABE: Chairperson, some people's lives are incomplete if  they  do  not
talk about the strategic defence procurement packages. [Interjections.]

It is an honour to be part of today's debate.  A  South  African  who  never
experienced life in a township or in a rural area will not  appreciate  what
this  Budget  provides  for  the  poor  people  of  this  country.  Economic
development  and  growth  will  never  be  complete  without  infrastructure
development in formerly disadvantaged areas. It is  a  great  challenge  for
Government to develop infrastructure for a large  section  of  this  country
which for ages and ages has been denied access to basic services.

Government's fiscal policy aims to promote growth  and  development.  During
the past few years, the Budget focused on  reducing  the  heavy  debt  which
this Government inherited from the apartheid system. As a result, there  was
slow growth and infrastructure development which was not prioritised in  the
Budget. Commencing with the previous year's Budget,  the  fiscal  policy  is
now focused on promoting  growth  and  development  which  can  be  realised
through spending on infrastructure.

This  year's  Budget  advances  further  in  addressing  the   backlogs   of
infrastructure  development  which  will  make  a  major   impact   on   the
sustainable development of the economy. I note that capital expenditure  has
declined in the past few years and  now  accounts  for  9,3%  of  the  total
expenditure by provinces. It is of great necessity for one to focus on  this
section. Sustainable growth requires investment in  infrastructure  capacity
in order to include the ordinary South Africans who were never empowered  by
the merciless system of apartheid and could not effectively  participate  in
the economy at that particular time.
Participation  in   the   economy   and   infrastructure   development   are
unachievable without developing the skills of the ordinary citizens of  this
country. Therefore, investing in infrastructure  and  human  resources  will
come to fruition in the long term, and not now.

Spending on public infrastructure gives the poor people  an  opportunity  to
develop their skills which are vital for growth.  Therefore,  investment  in
capital expenditure in the rural areas includes the rollout  of  electricity
to those areas. In the past, people in those areas never  had  any  hope  of
having electricity. None of us ever expected rural areas to have  access  to
electricity at this particular time. A thing of  value  is  a  joy  forever.
Having electricity in a rural area is a dream realised against all odds.  To
those who grew up in electrified houses and streets, access  to  electricity
is a minor issue which needs no appreciation.

The vulnerable groups, which are women and  children,  will  now  move  with
safety in the streets in the evenings and in the early hours of the  morning
when  they  have  to  get  up  to  go  to  work  or  to  school.  Therefore,
electrification in those areas will lead to a decline in crime.  Women  will
easily prepare food for their families in a  short  space  of  time  without
having to travel long distances to collect heavy firewood.

The Budget makes provision for investment in  water  supply  infrastructure.
We call upon all our people to avail themselves of and participate in  these
programmes when they are  rolled  out  to  their  areas.  Therefore,  active
participation will let them have access to water and job opportunities.

To many of our people, water is a rare and  valuable  commodity.  Women  and
children in the rural areas travel long distances in the  scorching  sun  to
get a mere bucket of water. In some areas, the only available  water  is  in
the dam or in the river, which is used for washing clothes and  drinking  by
animals as well as for human consumption.

As a result, in some of these areas the  people  find  themselves  prone  to
diseases such as cholera.  So  through  the  development  of  infrastructure
these people will, for the first time in their lives,  have  access  to  six
kilolitres  of  free  water  in  their  homes.  The  development  of   water
infrastructure will also be of  great  value  to  developing  farmers.  Most
people in the rural  areas  have  given  up  crop  farming  because  of  the
scarcity of water, as they depend on rain water for  irrigation.  So  modern
irrigation systems were a far-fetched idea to these people, and now we  hope
such people will return to crop farming so that they can  create  their  own
jobs. The availability of clean  water  would  help  to  provide  sanitation
infrastructure, with the majority of South Africans having access to it.

The Budget allocation for land reform in rural areas  has  increased.  These
areas have a bitter history of neglect by the apartheid  system.  They  were
never thought  of  when  allocation  for  infrastructure  was  made  in  the
previous Parliament. It must also be noted that most people worked on  farms
and they have acquired high skills without any certification. So,  they  are
the ones who will derive benefits from the  development  of  infrastructure.
Most of these people engaged in farming for commercial  purposes,  owing  to
lack of infrastructure in their areas.

A large part of  Government  infrastructure  development  is  undertaken  by
entities that operate outside  the  main  Budget  framework.  These  include
rail, air and harbour services. It must be borne  in  mind  that  Government
infrastructure expenditure is derived from capital expenditure at all  three
levels of Government and public-private partnership.

The Budget makes  provision  for  the  rehabilitation  of  roads  that  were
damaged by floods and for the construction of new roads; for  instance,  the
N4 platinum highway which connects  us  with  the  rest  of  the  continent.
Therefore, investment in capital expenditure has both  immediate  and  long-
term socioeconomic
spin-offs.

It also creates  favourable  conditions  for  economic  diversification  and
gives poor people access to services and opportunities.  I  want  to  remind
those  who  are  given  this  mammoth  task  by  Government   to   construct
infrastructure, and that they  must  ensure  that  they  deliver  a  quality
service.

We are aware that some view Government tenders as an opportunity to  make  a
lot of money by constructing low-quality infrastructure, different from  the
model presented during the tendering process.

We are aware that in some areas the quality of electrical infrastructure  is
not of the expected standard. This means that those contractors do not  care
about the safety of our people. To them greed,  rather  than  sustainability
and safety, is of high priority.

We also believe that the Public Finance  Management  Act  provides  a  sound
framework for implementation of Government  spending  decisions.  We  expect
that various  Government  departments  will  monitor,  evaluate  and  report
regularly on their expenditure. It is also vital that Parliament  prioritise
this oversight function over these departments.

Departments and provinces must be held accountable for revenue not spent  in
a particular Budget year  or  spent  only  at  the  end  of  the  year.  The
underlying intention of  Government  with  the  Budget  is  to  improve  the
quality of the lives of our people [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Chairperson,  hon  Ministers  and  hon  members,  the  2002-03
Budget is a positive one, balancing the  needs  of  all  competing  interest
groups with tax  relief  for  all  income  groups.  Revenue  rose  to  R2,65
billion, R15 billion more  than  was  expected.  Revenue  success  regarding
revenue collection is closing the tax gap, and  this  has  made  tax  relief
possible with stronger social spending.

The deficit will amount to R22,7 billion - that is, 2,1% of the  GDP  -  and
personal tax cuts will put R15 billion back into the taxpayers' pockets.

Taxpayers earning less than R27 000 will pay no tax.  The  increase  in  the
interest income exemption from R4 000 to R 6000 for taxpayers under the  age
of 65 is a positive step.

A number of macroeconomic factors must  be  taken  into  account  when  this
particular budget is  evaluated.  Inflation  is  on  the  increase.  We  are
increasing a relatively low growth rate and the rand  has  declined  against
the  dollar.  Our  present  official   unemployment   rate   of   37,5%   is
unacceptable. The SA economy  has  shed  13%  of  its  formal  jobs  in  the
nonagricultural sector since 1995. Personal savings have also declined  from
a disappointing 1,5% three years ago to the present below zero.

The announcement in this regard that tax relief  on  interest  received  and
the accelerated depreciation allowances for the manufacturing of  assets  is
welcomed. The announcement  by  the  Minister  that  a  task  team  will  be
appointed  regarding  taxes  that  relate  to  the  retirement  industry  is
significant. Time is of the essence. Tax on interest and  rental  income  of
retirement funds is damaging and is another way of taxing savings.  To  some
this constitutes a double tax.

The balance of this budget accentuates the demand side of  the  economy.  It
is an attempt to address poverty alleviation and  some  variables  necessary
for future sustained economic growth. Positive budgets  do  not  necessarily
guarantee delivery. The lack of capacity to actually spend  money  allocated
to national, local and provincial levels is reason for concern.

The  implementation  of  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act  with   heavy
penalties  for  nondelivery  will  have  to  address  this  quite  untenable
situation.

One of the many achievements of  the  Department  of  Finance  is  that  the
surprise factor was taken out of the Budget  and  it  was  replaced  by  the
introduction of three-year budgets and the Annual Medium Term Budget  Policy
statement, which gives a  lot  of  clarity  to  taxpayers  and  to  all  the
relevant officials concerned.

To conclude: The 2002 Budget tax cuts will benefit all  categories  of  wage
earners. The question we will have to ask ourselves is: Will this  stem  the
present alarming exodus of capital and skills from this country?

The South African  economy  still  lacks  the  economic  growth  to  provide
adequate employment. The low savings rate at present is failing  to  attract
more  foreign  capital,  which  is  another   prerequisite   for   sustained
development.

It is not enough to drive  economic  growth  through  public  spending.  The
support given to small, medium and microeconomic enterprises is  noteworthy.
An urgent request  is  made  that  in  future  a  substantial  reduction  in
corporate tax be implemented. The relaxation of exchange controls will  also
foster foreign investor confidence.

The 2002 Budget can be summarised as a budget on growth and  a  budget  that
lessens taxes. [Applause.]

Mr B A MNGUNI: Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon colleagues, the  level  of
employment has  been  decreasing  for  the  past  20  years.  This  is  more
prominent in the primary sector, especially in mining  and  agriculture.  It
was Anglo American's long-term strategy objective four  years  ago  that  by
2008 it should have reduced its gold production in South Africa to  40%  and
relocated in Western Africa, where labour and technology was still cheap.

Increasing levels of unemployment are further exacerbated by  the  quest  of
the  corporate  sector  to  maximise  their  efficiencies,  production   and
consequently profits. Small and  big  financially  sound  companies  are  in
joint ventures. Acquisition measures are nowadays the norm in order to  take
advantage of the benefits offered by economies of scale,  but  unfortunately
they lead to the sacrifice of a lot of jobs in  the  process  of  gaining  a
sustainable competitive advantage in global economies, of which we are  part
today.

This is of great concern in that the present democratic Government  has  not
been able to create enough jobs since its inception. It is  not  by  default
that we find ourselves in this situation.  We  vigilantly  and  deliberately
chose this route, armed with a mixed open economic  policy,  because  it  is
the only means of survival in this phase of our liberation struggle.

When we look at the picture of over  two  decades  ago  which  I  have  just
painted above, we will realise that this Government has done  a  great  deal
so far to address the socioeconomic ills that have been prevalent  over  the
40 years of capitalistic  apartheid  rule.  Per  se,  it  may  mean  jobless
economic growth. On the contrary, I would argue that we do create  jobs  but
they are not enough to absorb the ever-increasing number of new  job-seekers
and retrenched or laid-off workers because the economy  grew  from  2,5%  to
more than 3% from 1993 to 2000 respectively, before dropping to 2,5% in  the
first quarter of 2001. Over the same period, the  financial  sector  managed
to create about 2% of jobs while wholesale trading  industry  increased  job
creation by 0,4%.

The question is: What is Government doing to address the situation? Some  of
the answers to this question lie  in  the  Appropriation  Bill  we  are  now
debating. It has already been successfully argued  that  there  has  been  a
major shift towards social spending to push back the frontiers  of  poverty.
This has been a deliberate effort by Government to intervene in the  economy
by injecting  funds  in  the  system  to  stimulate  growth  to  combat  the
increasing unemployment. This expansionary fiscal policy  we  have  embarked
upon should be viewed against the global economic  downturn  that  has  been
exacerbated by the 11 September events in America last year.

This Budget is a one part of the cornerstones  of  the  policies  that  will
build the type of economy which will be able  to  absorb  and  address  this
issue by way of developing skills amongst  youth  and  the  unemployed,  and
absorb exogenous factors that have inevitable effects on our economy.

The fundamental question that arises centres on what could be done, and  how
quickly, to rectify the situation. I think there  are  four  main  strategic
objectives we have to look at in order to address  the  situation:  firstly,
improving the foundations for human  development;  secondly,  improving  the
supply of high- quality skills which are more  responsive  to  the  societal
and  economic  needs  of  our  country;  and  thirdly,  increasing  employer
participation in lifelong learning and  support  employment  growth  through
industrial policies, innovation and research and development. In  more  ways
than one this Bill is  directly  addressing  issues  over  the  Medium  Term
Expenditure Framework period.

Attempts to counter the rising unemployment are  taking  place  against  the
background of skilled  labour  leaving  the  country.  As  a  strategic  job
creation project and the means of introducing the majority  of  our  African
population which has been sidelined from the  mainstrean  economy  over  the
years, to that economy, the microfinance agencies such as Khula  and  Ntsika
need to strategically engage this valuable asset in  a  more  proactive  and
vigorous manner, and  simultaneously  harness  the  spirit  of  Letsema  and
Vukuzenzele for the maximum benefit of our communities and  the  country  at
large.

This Budget has  further  shown  Government's  commitment  to  dealing  with
unemployment by allocating more resources in developing  small,  medium  and
micro enterprises. Together with the informal sector SMMEs have been  proved
to be most successful in absorbing many of the  unemployed  population,  and
actually it has been found that they form the basis of the economy  in  most
developed countries.

It has been long established that a major source of inflation,  particularly
in developing countries, is  excessive  government  expenditure  to  finance
government budget deficits.

According to the latest economic reports, South Africa has managed to  bring
Government's expenditure and the deficit  under  control,  thus  eliminating
significant potential sources  of  inflationary  pressure.  Because  of  the
prudent  fiscal  policy  pursued  by  the  Government  under  the  visionary
leadership of the ANC, the steady decline in fiscal deficit  has  translated
into a decline in the public-sector borrowing requirements.  The  importance
of this is that lower public debt and  deficits  will  contribute  to  lower
interest rates.

Without a sound monetary  policy,  we  will  not  be  able  to  combat  many
consequential ripple effects associated with inflation and  interest  rates.
With the introduction of  inflation  targeting  in  February  of  2002,  the
monetary policy was given a clear and unambiguous target. Though it  appears
as if we might miss our inflation target this year,  I  am  optimistic  that
the Reserve Bank will work hard in order to meet the target  over  the  METF
period, that is, by the 2003-04 financial year.

However, monetary policy does not contribute  directly  to  economic  growth
and employment creation in the long run, but rather  to  creating  a  stable
financial  environment.  It  fulfils  an  important  precondition  for   the
attainment of economic development.

Despite criticism by those who argued against the  welfare  consequences  of
Government's macroeconomic policy and despite the failure of growth to  meet
the target set for the number of jobs to  be  created,  the  Government  can
claim considerable credit for having created and maintaining an  environment
of enviable stability at both political and microeconomic level.

Allow me to address a few issues that  have  been  raised  at  this  podium.
Economists have calculated that the tax cut of R15 billion  translates  into
interest rate cuts of about 4%. I have said that the  ANC  has  a  visionary
leadership, and this is evidenced by the 1% rise in interest rates when  one
looks at 4% interest cuts. As the committee says, we are still living  above
the interest rate, which means that the poor still have another 3% to  spend
besides the interest rate increase.

The objective of an interest rates increase is for us to be able attain  the
inflation target in  the  2003-04  financial  year,  because  we  need  high
stability in order for investors to come into the country to invest and  for
our local investors to  be  able  to  reap  the  economic  benefits  of  our
economy.

As this is the year of  volunteers,  we  have  set  ourselves  the  goal  of
pushing back the frontiers of poverty. We dare not fail. [Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Chairperson, South Africa  has  not  gone  unaffected  by  the
traumatic events in Zimbabwe over the past two years. Apart from  having  to
deal with the vast problem of human migration, South  Africa's  economy  has
been negatively affected by a decline in trade, a plunge  in  the  value  of
the rand and a fall in investor confidence.

Events in Zimbabwe have had an impact on the modest GDP growth  targets  set
by the Minister of Finance, and, if they persist, they  could  put  paid  to
any prospect of achieving the growth target of 7% per annum  set  by  Nepad.
Now that the elections in Zimbabwe have been held,  the  current  debate  is
over the issue of whether the elections were free or fair or not.

Let me say there may be differences of opinion on the extent  to  which  the
elections were not free and fair. However, any African  leader  who  may  be
tempted to  whitewash  this  flawed  election  or  gloss  over  the  glaring
violations of democracy, human rights and the  rule  of  law  that  occurred
during the protracted period of  the  electoral  process  will  be  doing  a
disservice to Africa and will be undermining the credibility of Nepad.  Such
action will convey the impression that these  leaders  are  not  serious  in
their commitment to democracy.

With Zimbabwe now, what next? Zimbabwe is facing a socioeconomic  crisis  of
massive proportions. The economy is in a state of collapse, unemployment  is
soaring, millions of Zimbabweans have already  crossed  their  borders  into
neighbouring countries and millions more who remain face  starvation.  Added
to this there is the risk of instability.

Zimbabwe   faces   a   mammoth   task   of   socioeconomic   and   political
reconstruction.

Zimbabwe will not be able to manage this task on its own. It will  need  the
assistance  of  the  international  community  and  the   support   of   its
neighbours.

Where should South  Africa  stand  in  this  crisis  facing  the  people  of
Zimbabwe? Firstly, in respect  of  the  humanitarian  crisis,  South  Africa
cannot  stand  back  and  watch  our  fellow  Africans  die  of  hunger  and
starvation.  At  the  very  least  South  Africa  will  have  to   mount   a
humanitarian food aid campaign on a massive scale.

Secondly, the people of Zimbabwe need  stability:  not  stability  based  on
arrest,  detention   and   security   action,   but   stability   based   on
reconciliation rather than on revenge. South Africa must encourage  Zimbabwe
to repair the damage that has been done to the fabric of  society  while  it
is adopting the policy of  inclusiveness,  and  not  exclusiveness.  At  the
political level this means some form of government of national unity.

Thirdly, South Africa could help the people of  Zimbabwe  to  restore  their
battered economy. Indeed, it  is  in  South  Africa's  interest  to  do  so.
However, South Africa must make it clear that it is not  prepared  to  throw
good money after bad. South Africa's involvement must  be  conditional  upon
Zimbabwe  introducing  credible  economic  management  and  sound   economic
policies.

Fourthly, South Africa must play a  leading  part  in  ensuring  that  as  a
matter of  urgency,  Zimbabwe  returns  to  good  governance  based  on  the
principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Zimbabwe must  be
made fully aware of the  consequences  of  its  continuing  to  violate  the
founding principles of the SADC or the OAU  or  of  Nepad.  Good  governance
based on democracy, human rights or the rule of law is  a  precondition  for
economic growth and human development in Africa. It is the bedrock on  which
Nepad has been built and without which Nepad will be bound to fail.

The Democratic Alliance wants to see the South  African  Government  at  the
forefront, and not trailing behind, in  a  campaign  to  promote  democracy,
human rights and law in Africa. Government must be prepared to give  support
and encouragement to democratic forces where they are in Africa.  Government
must show solidarity with people whose rights have been trampled  underfoot,
and to do this Government will have to follow a policy  that  is  much  more
proactive, more results-oriented and more transparent than it  has  been  in
the past.

This will demand of the Government a willingness to  take  tough  decisions,
and it will require courageous leadership. This is a tall  order,  but  then
for Africa the stakes are high. [Applause.]

Mr B J NOBUNGA: Chairperson,  hon  Ministers  and  hon  members,  maybe  one
should  start  by  requesting  the  Portfolio  Committee  on   Justice   and
Constitutional Development, when they deal with the  Bill  on  crossing  the
floor, to effect amendments that will allow crossing  the  borders,  because
it is clear from the manner in which the DP is interested in  Zimbabwe  that
they might consider crossing to Zimbabwe itself. [Applause.]

Year after year, when the  Minister  of  Finance  presents  the  Budget,  it
always fills one with hope about the future of this  country,  and  it  also
confirms the right  direction  that  we  are  taking  in  restructuring  our
economy, thanks to the visionary leadership of the ANC,  which  has  managed
to do all these wonders without  the  experience  of  running  a  government
before.

South Africa has to pride itself on having such  an  organisation.  We  have
made significant strides and we continue to put South Africa on  the  global
economic map despite those who are opposed to progress and prosperity.

I must say with pride that we are getting there and  we  are  on  the  right
track. There are many challenges facing us as a nation, but the greatest  is
to fight to make the lives of our people better. As the  Government  of  the
people, under the leadership of the ANC, we remain firmly committed, and  we
have put high on the agenda the people's needs and aspirations.

The ANC, as an organisation of the  people,  strives  to  create  a  people-
centred society. This is our long-held ideal. In 1955  at  the  Congress  of
the People in Kliptown, we said in  the  Freedom  Charter  that  the  people
shall govern, and also that no government shall claim  authority  unless  it
is based on the will of the people.

There is  therefore  a  great  need  to  make  ward  committees  at  various
municipalities functional in order to enable the people to  determine  their
destiny by participating in these ward committees. The concept of a  people-
centred society at local  government  level  hinges  around  the  successful
functioning of ward committees.

Having strong local government cements our democracy,  and  further  enables
the people to really determine their destiny. The increase of 18,3%  a  year
over the MTEF period for local government funding is a clear  indication  of
our  Government's  commitment  to  strengthening  local  government  and  to
improving the conditions of our people.

The Freedom Charter further states  that  the  people  shall  share  in  the
country's  wealth.  The  increases  in  local  government  allocations   are
essentially intended at addressing the imbalances of the  past  and  are  an
effort to push back the frontiers of poverty. This cannot be  questioned  by
those responsible for creating these conditions, who  today  pretend  to  be
champions of the struggle against those very conditions which they created.

The Government, through the adjustments  estimate,  allocated  R200  million
for the provision of free basic  services  to  our  people.  In  the  Budget
before us, the equitable share for local government increased by 4%  between
2002-03 and 2004-05. The increase is intended to  facilitate  the  provision
of free basic services. We also hope that  the  expected  Municipal  Finance
Management Bill, which is supposed to come into operation  towards  the  end
of June, will go a long way in ensuring that there  is  prudent  utilisation
of the resources at local government level, which will help  free  resources
to better the lives of our people.

In order to be able to fight poverty, hunger, disease and  unemployment,  we
need to ensure that we improve the conditions under which  our  people  find
themselves. These are  conditions  of  homelessness,  illiteracy  and  being
vulnerable to abuse by those controlling the economy in this country.

Let me congratulate the Department of Water Affairs on having won the  Globe
Water Award. This is in recognition of  the  standard  and  quality  of  our
water resource in this country, and is recognition of a nation  at  work.  I
hope this will inspire us  to  work  even  harder  in  ensuring  that  every
household  in  this  country  benefits  from  the  great   efforts   -   and
achievements - that our Government is making.

The past imbalances  created  poor  conditions  at  local  government  level
through a legislative set-up that shifted the tax bases of areas, where  the
majority of the people of this country lived, to white areas.  This  led  to
the systematic degradation of areas where the majority  population  of  this
country lived, blacks  in  particular,  which  today  are  characterised  by
underdevelopment and poorly planned or absent infrastructure.

The  new  local  government  legislative  framework,  especially  the  Local
Government: Municipal Systems Act, recognises communities as integral  parts
of municipalities who play an active role in local governance.

We have restored the dignity of these communities by  recognising  the  need
for them to  have  services  and  improved  conditions  in  these  areas  by
promoting local  economic  development.  We  are  calling  on  the  business
communities to join us in the struggle to establish a strong and  sound  tax
base in these areas by investing in the previously  disadvantaged  areas  in
particular. We, however, thank the few private sector stakeholders who  have
already started investing in such needy areas.

The agenda for promoting local economic development at local  level  is  the
responsibility of both the public and the private sector. So let us make  it
a success. It is by our concerted effort in showing confidence  in  our  own
economy by  investing  in  it  that  the  confidence  of  foreign  potential
investment can be enhanced.

Government has made available an even  greater  Budget  for  infrastructural
development, which can serve as  an  incentive  to  the  private  sector  to
invest in these areas, thereby  broadening  the  tax  base  and  eliminating
poverty. Stronger municipalities that are not fiscally dependent on  central
Government can go a long way in  making  South  Africa  free  from  poverty,
deprivation and underdevelopment, which can improve our  competitiveness  in
the global economy.

We need to create jobs, fight  crime  and  reinvigorate  the  pride  of  the
people in themselves, particularly the youth, who currently bear  the  brunt
of unemployment and deprivation. This will also go a  long  way  in  helping
even those communities who still feel left  behind  to  start  enjoying  the
fruits of liberty. These initiatives undoubtedly pose  a  serious  challenge
to the private sector to show their commitment  and  patriotism.  Government
has come to the party by doing all that I have referred to  above.  Let  the
private  sector  join  in  the  fight  against  poverty,  homelessness   and
unemployment.

The Government's unwavering commitment to improving the  conditions  of  our
people is best illustrated in this budget  by  means  of  the  provision  of
funds for the Urban Renewal Programme and the Integrated  Sustainable  Rural
Development Programme. These are the programmes  which  further  demonstrate
Government's  determination  to  level  the  playing   field   by   creating
conditions for meaningful economic growth, rehabilitating towns  and  making
rural community areas conducive to economic investment, with reduced  crime,
poverty and deprivation.

We fought hard for this democracy, and many gallant  freedom  fighters  laid
down their lives for it. It is too early for the people of this  country  to
forget the sacrifices that were made by people who loved their  country  and
its people. The challenge to all of us, therefore, is to respect and  honour
these gallant freedom fighters, as well as what they  stood  and  died  for.
This can only happen if we all commit  ourselves  to  defending,  advancing,
and deepening this hard-earned democracy by ensuring that we  contribute  to
bettering the lives of the people and the country.

When we came to power in 1994 inflation was at  about  8%,  and  the  Budget
deficit was at about 6% of GDP. But today inflation is at about 6,6% and  we
have been consistently experiencing a decrease in the Budget deficit  up  to
2,1% in the year 2000-01, rising slightly in the year 2002-03 and  projected
to fall to 1,7% of GDP in 2004-05.

These are some of the serious strides that we have made as a country,  which
also dispel  the  myth  that  a  black  Government  cannot  run  an  economy
efficiently. There  are  still  those  who  prefer  to  abuse  the  freedoms
provided for in the Bill of Rights to distort these great achievements  that
we have as a country.

Let me conclude by urging every citizen of South Africa, particularly  those
in the opposition, to join us in  the  march  to  make  our  country,  whose
democracy is admired by friends and  foes  alike  in  the  world,  a  better
country.
This country has enough problems that were created by the ills of  apartheid
that we are trying to address. Let it be known that we will  not  waste  our
energies by engaging  in  accusations  and  counteraccusations,  but  rather
engage in strengthening our democracy and making the  lives  of  our  people
better. [Applause.]

Mr F BEUKMAN: Chairperson, I quote:


  Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine,  but  against
  hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival
  of a working economy in the world  so  as  to  permit  the  emergence  of
  political and social conditions in which  free  institutions  can  exist.
  Such assistance, I am convinced, must not be  on  a  piecemeal  basis  as
  various crises develop.

This quotation was from the speech at Harvard's Memorial Church  on  5  June
1947, where Secretary George Marshall launched the  Marshall  Plan  for  the
economic revival of postwar Europe.

Daar is ook lesse vir Suid- en Suider-Afrika in  wat  in  hierdie  begroting
vervat is. Mnr Manuel se begrotingsrede bevat ook die raamwerk  wat  gefokus
is  op  die  bekamping  van  armoede,  maar  ook  die  skep  van   werk   en
ontwikkelingsgeleenthede en toegang van geleenthede vir diegene wat  in  die
verlede  ontmagtig  is.  Een  van  die  debatspunte  wat  hierdie  begroting
voorafgegaan het, was die gedagte van 'n sogenaamde ``basic  income  grant''
van R100 aan alle burgers. Hierdie plan is  veral  deur  kerkgroepe  en  die
politieke partye aan die linkerkant van die Raad,  soos  die  DP  en  Cosatu
ondersteun.

Ons stem saam met die  Minister  van  Finansies  dat  die  voorstel  van  'n
algemene basiese toelaag van R100 nie lewensvatbaar is nie. Deur  'n  bedrag
van R46 miljard  te  vind  om  hierdie  voorstel  te  finansier,  moet  daar
drastiese styging in bepaalde belastings kom.  Deur  8%  van  staatsinkomste
onbepaald aan sodanige projekte te verbind, kan die vermoë van die  regering
om geld los te maak vir infrastruktuur en werkskepping  ernstig  kniehalter.
Dalk moet die partye aan die linkerkant van die Raad weer hul somme maak  en
wys hoe hulle hierdie basiese inkomstetoelaag gaan finansier.

Die welsynstaat of  die  konsep  waar  die  staat  die  alfa  en  omega  van
onderhoud en inkomste is, is in terme van  ontwikkelende  ekonomieë  nie  'n
langtermyn lewensvatbare  opsie  nie.  Soos  die  bekende  kommentator  J  P
Landman in Die Burger van Dinsdag tereg opmerk:


  'n Mens wonder of die kerkvaders besef waarvoor hulle hul  inlaat  en  of
  lidmate besef wat in hul naam gedoen word en of middelstandwerkers  besef
  hoe dit hul kans op aflegging verhoog.

Mens kan seker byvoeg: Wat sal die kiesers hiervan sê, indien  54,5  miljoen
burgers sal kwalifiseer vir R100? Dit sal omtrent die  totale  inkomste  uit
BTW van  omtrent  R53  miljard  insluk.  Die  BTW-koers  sal  minstens  moet
verdubbel om vir hierdie basiese inkomstetoelaag  te  betaal.  Soos  Landman
tereg aandui,  dat  om  'n  bedrag  gelykstaande  aan  Suid-Afrika  se  BTW-
invorderings deur inkomstebelasting op salaristrekkers af te  laai,  sal  'n
nekslag wees aan besparings. Dit sal investering ondermyn en regstreeks  lei
tot meer werkloosheid en armoede.

Die vertrekpunt van  werkskepping  en  die  verbreding  van  die  korps  van
burgers wat ekonomies aktief is en vir hul gesinne kan sorg,  lê  daarin  om
vir  die  privaatsektor  en  vir  die  entrepreneurs  maklik  te   maak   om
werkgeleenthede te skep. Sakemanne sê reguit: Ons sal  meer  mense  aanstel,
maar gee ons minder reëls en  regulasies.  Maak  dit  vir  ons  moontlik  om
diensvoorwaardes  by  ekonomiese  omstandighede  aan  te  pas.  Baie  firmas
gebruik konsultante eerder as permanente werkers. Industrieë in die  primêre
sektor  vul  nie  vaste  vakatures  wat  ontstaan  nie.  Kontrakwerkers   en
seisoenwerkers is nou die in-ding.

Die gedagte van 'n ``basic income grant'' is dalk 'n populistiese  idee  wat
banieropskrifte en sakeblaaie maak, of  tydens  tv-tyd  vir  'n  paar  DStv-
kykers  opgewonde  maak,  maar  gedagtig  aan  die   groot   ekonomiese   en
maatskaplike vraagstukke waarmee Suid-Afrika te doen het, is ad  hoc  stappe
soos 'n  basiese  toelaag  nie  'n  langtermynoplossing  nie.  Ons  kan  nie
kortpaaie gebruik om dit te bereik nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die grondslag  wat
die Minister in hierdie begroting lê, is die regte  roete.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There are also lessons for South and Southern Africa in what  is  contained
in this Budget. Mr Manuel's Budget Speech also contains the framework  which
is focused on the combating of poverty, but also the  creation  of  job  and
development opportunities and access to opportunities  for  those  who  were
disempowered in the past. One of the points of debate  which  preceded  this
Budget was the idea of a so-called  basic  income  grant  of  R100  for  all
citizens. This plan was supported particularly  by  church  groups  and  the
political parties on the left-hand side of the House, such  as  the  DP  and
Cosatu.

We agree with the Minister of Finance that the proposal of a  general  basic
grant of R100 is not viable. In order to find an amount of  R46  billion  to
finance this proposal,  there  would  have  to  be  a  drastic  increase  in
specific taxes. By  linking  8%  of  public  revenue  indefinitely  to  such
projects, the Government's ability to release money for  infrastructure  and
job creation could be seriously hampered. Perhaps the parties  on  the  left
side of the House should redo their sums and show  how  they  are  going  to
finance this basic income grant.

The welfare state or the concept in which the state is the alpha  and  omega
of maintenance and income, is not a viable  long-term  option  in  terms  of
developing economies. As the well-known commentator J  P  Landman  correctly
remarked in Die Burger on Tuesday:


  'n Mens wonder of die kerkvaders besef waarvoor hulle hul  inlaat  en  of
  lidmate besef wat in hul naam gedoen word en of middelstandwerkers  besef
  hoe dit hul kans op aflegging verhoog.

One could probably add: What will  the  voters  say  about  this,  if  R54,5
million citizens were to qualify for R100? This will virtually  consume  the
total revenue from VAT of approximately R53 billion. The VAT rate  would  at
least have to double  to  pay  for  this  basic  income  grant.  As  Landman
correctly  indicates,  passing  an  amount  equal  to  South  Africa's   VAT
collections to salaried persons by way of income tax  would  be  a  blow  to
savings.  It  will  undermine  investment  and   lead   directly   to   more
unemployment and poverty.

The point of departure for job creation and the expansion of  the  corps  of
citizens who are economically active and can take care  of  their  families,
lies in making it easy for the  private  sector  and  the  entrepreneurs  to
create jobs. Businessmen say clearly: ``We will  appoint  more  people,  but
give us fewer rules and regulations.  Make  it  possible  for  us  to  adapt
conditions of service to economic conditions''. Many firms  use  consultants
rather than permanent employees. Industries in the  primary  sector  do  not
fill vacancies which arise. Contract workers and seasonal  workers  are  now
the in thing.

The idea of a basic income grant is perhaps a populist idea which  makes  it
onto banners and business pages,  or  makes  a  few  DStv  watchers  excited
during TV time, but bearing in mind  the  big  economic  and  social  issues
which South Africa has to deal with, ad hoc steps such as a basic grant  are
not  long-term  solutions.  We  cannot  use  short  cuts  to  achieve  this.
[Interjections.] The foundation which the Minister lays in  this  Budget  is
the right route.]]

Mr C M LOWE: Mr Chairperson, the hon Mr Beukman and his party  leader  might
recall that, not too many years ago, a previous Minister of  Finance,  never
once elected to public  office,  claimed  before  this  House  that  he  had
covered his eyes when signing treasury cheques, chose to mislead  Parliament
on where and how public funds were spent and presided  over  a  morally  and
financially bankrupt apartheid fiscus.
That era is now happily merely part of what some euphemistically term  ``our
colourful history'', and while there may be times when the current  Minister
of Finance might wish that he too enjoyed the luxury of  being  a  nominated
MP, I suspect that he, like the  rest  of  us,  far  prefers  being  a  true
democrat, freely and honourably elected by the people of  South  Africa  and
subject to their collective judgment at  the  ballot  box  -  tragically,  a
right still denied to the people of Zimbabwe.

The Minister claims that this year's Budget focuses on sustainable  economic
growth and alleviating poverty. Where he succeeds, we  acknowledge  and  pay
tribute to a Treasury and a Minister that, as the  hon  the  Minister  Kader
Asmal has already pointed out, has changed since those days of  eye  patches
and invisible ink. But when he fails, we, in this  opposition  anyway,  free
and unfettered by offers of Cabinet seats and diplomatic  postings,  have  a
duty, not a luxury as Mr Asmal has said, to hold him and his  colleagues  in
Government to account to the people they claim to represent.

Their attempts to marginalise and even ignore our input are regrettable  and
shortsighted but will not deter us even one iota on this side of the  House,
Africans and patriots all, from our mission  to  help  make  our  country  a
better place for all who live in her. For increasing numbers  of  those  who
live in  her  these  are  dark  and  desperate  times  of  gnawing  poverty,
unemployment  and  hunger.  Such  circumstances  call  for  brave  and  bold
leadership, for clarity of vision and for men and women willing and able  to
break out of the mould of business as usual, of more of the same.

As my DA colleagues have noted, the  Budget  takes  little  account  of  the
desperation of millions of unemployed South  Africans  who  live  in  abject
poverty and often hopelessness. It may offer R15 billion in taxation  relief
to those lucky enough to have jobs that pay enough to make  them  taxpayers,
but it fails those who need it most, our  children  and  the  poor  and  the
vulnerable.

As the Mail & Guardian so aptly noted:


  The Minister's profligate protest that he  was  a  man  seized  with  the
  business of addressing poverty had, when it came to the figures, all  the
  weight of a ball of fluff.
Why is the child support grant not being extended to children over  the  age
of seven? Where is the basic income grant that both Idasa and  the  hon  Ken
Andrew have ably showed  can  both  be  provided  and  sustained?  Does  the
Government even have the capacity and the ability to spend the money it  has
allocated elsewhere?

Despite the rhetoric and the ringing endorsements of a string of  Government
praise-singers this afternoon, the reality is  very  different.  In  writing
about his international investment council,  President  Mbeki  endorses  the
view that we could change negative perceptions about South  Africa  just  by
telling the truth. To some extent he is right, for far too  many  people  do
downplay the positive and ignore the radical improvements  that  have  taken
place under this Government.

But the truth is also a harsh and a hostile one  that  this  Government  too
often ignores or palms off by questioning our patriotism or charging  us  as
racists, or being antitransformation. The truth is that  nearly  27  million
South Africans live below the poverty line and over 5  million  children  go
to bed hungry each night, while millions of rand allocated  to  feed  hungry
schoolchildren each day is either stolen or unspent.

Against this background the truth is that the price of maize  has  increased
by more than 66% since May and interest  rates  have  been  increased  again
this afternoon, the second time this year. That is a truth that  also  needs
telling and one that demands more than just a curt  or  dismissive  response
from the Minister of Finance.

The Minister ended his Budget Speech by referring  to  the  words  of  Chief
Albert Luthuli. I should like  to  conclude  by  quoting  the  words  of  an
equally illustrious man of the 20th century,  Martin  Luther  King  Jr,  who
said:


  The ultimate measure of a man is  not  where  he  stands  in  moments  of
  comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times  of  challenge  and
  controversy.

[Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Where were you when we were  in  jail?  Where  were
you when we were on Robben Island?

Mr C M LOWE: These indeed are days of challenge  and  controversy.  Far  too
many of our people spend every single day battling to simply survive.  Where
does the Minister stand? [Applause.]

Prof B TUROK: Chairperson, earlier this afternoon when  the  Deputy  Speaker
was at the podium, there was an incident in the  House  in  connection  with
the display of a poster by the DA which is being investigated by the  Deputy
Speaker. I want to help the DP by doing the same thing, but for a  different
purpose. I have in front of  me  a  document  by  the  DP  which  is  called
``Economic liberation''. We ask: Liberation for whom?

We heard a speech of the bleeding hearts for the poor  South  Africans,  and
earlier we heard the hon Andrew surprisingly  calling  for  a  basic  income
grant. So, therefore, I have to refer to  the  policy  document  to  try  to
reconcile the call for a basic income grant for the poor  with  seeing  what
the DP really stands for. [Interjections.] This document tells us  that  the
DP wants lower income tax, lower company tax and the abolition of  secondary
tax on companies. But, as we heard this afternoon, they want a raise  of  1%
on VAT. [Interjections.] VAT hits the poor;  company  tax  helps  the  rich.
[Interjections.] So for whom do they want liberation? [Interjections.]

What the document tells us is that the individual is the engine of  economic
and  social  development.  They  want   minimum   government   interference.
``Government  must  be  lean;  government  expenditure  should  be   reduced
immediately by 2%''. They want deregulation; do they want  welfare  for  the
poor, or welfare for the  privileged?  So  those  are  the  principles  that
govern the DP, and I think when DP members come next time they  must  please
show that document, and not  the  one  they  had  earlier.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

I want to suggest that the DP has the mindset of hypocrisy, because they  do
not have the interests of the  poor  at  heart  but  the  interests  of  the
privileged. [Applause.]

Let me turn to the Budget. One  of  the  most  important  features  of  this
Budget is that it is expansionary, despite global uncertainty. I  think  the
Minister put forward a  very  important  issue  there  for  us  to  examine:
expansionary despite global uncertainty. The Minister of Finance  said  that
the  Budget  has  been  crafted  against  the  background  of   considerable
uncertainty about the gross prospects of  the  global  economy.  I  want  to
examine that. What is the nature of global uncertainty? I  do  not  want  to
discuss the nitty-gritty of this or that Vote. We will have  an  opportunity
in a month's time to discuss the Budget in detail. I  want  to  discuss  the
general background around which this Budget is contextualised. What  is  the
nature of global uncertainty?

Firstly, on the question of polarisation and poverty,  Minister  Manuel  has
been privileged to be invited together with  Michel  Camdessus,  the  former
head of the IMF, to go to the Monterrey conference and to discuss  financing
for development. I want to quote from what Monsieur Camdessus  said  in  the
year 2000, because he provides a context for our Budget. In the IMF  survey,
an official document of the IMF, he said:


     If we are not able to reverse the trends  toward  greater  inequalities
     between the poorest countries and the affluent countries,  there  is  a
     potential for a surge in extremism and  violenceÿ.ÿ.ÿ.  People  in  the
     poorest countries are the ultimate systemic threat.

I find that quote really prophetic. It precedes September 11th, it  precedes
the instability that we find in many Third World countries today,  and  what
Camdessus was saying, as a former head of the IMF -  a  very  rigid  finance
controlling institution - was that one must beware, because  the  future  of
the  world  faces  a  systemic  threat  from  the  poor,  if   poverty   and
polarisation increase.

To the people on this side who constantly  criticise  instability,  violence
and extremism in Africa, we know that when poverty comes in the  door,  love
goes out the window. [Interjections.] This is what my mother  used  to  tell
me: When poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window.  And  this  is
what happened in Africa.

Poverty has come through the door, and instability, violence  and  extremism
have come to the continent of Africa. Let us  be  aware  that  if  there  is
increasing poverty and increasing  polarisation  in  the  world  -  Monsieur
Camdessus has warned us of this, and that was two years ago - that  we  will
face the ultimate systemic threat to the international global  system  as  a
whole. President Ciampi this morning said exactly the same thing. He  warned
us that the polarisation of the world is a formula for instability. I  think
that we must take  care  of  that  and  we  must  understand  that  whatever
limitations there are in South African economic policy, they are located  in
the instability and problems of the global system as a whole.

The second element of global  uncertainty  comes  from  the  question  of  a
recession. We all know that the US is in a period of recession, Japan  seems
to be in an incurable period of  recession,  Europe  too,  and,  of  course,
there is Argentina. I do not want to say much more about that.  But  what  I
do want to say quite a lot about is the global uncertainty that  comes  from
poor corporate governance, which is now rocking the international  financial
sector, because those of  us  who  read  the  international  press  will  be
overwhelmed by the crisis of self-confidence and systemic doubts  which  has
arisen as a result of certain problems in the US.

Enron, the biggest bankruptcy ever in  the  world's  history,  has  hit  the
United States, and people are concerned, not just with the question  of  the
loss of investments by a million people who  invested  in  Enron,  but  also
with the basic moral issues and principles of business  which  underlie  the
collapse of Enron. ``The biggest bankruptcy ever'', Business  Week  said  on
25 February. ``Enron's unrelenting stress  on  growth  and  its  absence  of
control helped push executives in to  unethical  behaviour.''  The  American
Press, Business Week, The Economist , London's Financial  Times  -  a  whole
lot of them - are now talking about the crisis  of  self-confidence  in  the
international capitalist system, in the system of profit taking and  in  the
conditions which govern business in the  US  and  many  other  countries.  I
shall come to South Africa in a moment.

An HON MEMBER: We do not understand you.

Prof B TUROK: You do not understand a thing. [Laughter.]

Business Week has said: ``Americans  have  come  to  see  their  free-market
economy as largely immune to the  cronyism  that  plagues  so  many  foreign
countries, but they were shocked to see how Enron's cosy ties with  its  own
accounting firm inoculated it from scrutiny.'' Accounting firms  which  were
consultants to the same firm and doing the auditing, doing the  whole  thing
so that they were able to conceal all kinds  of  debts  and  problems  which
arose with Enron. So while there was an  initial  bubble  of  enthusiasm,  a
bubble of wealth, seemingly, when the collapse  came  people  saw  what  was
really going on.

There   were   weak   governance   structures.    There    were    fiduciary
responsibilities  of  directors  who  ignored  them.  There   was   reckless
management. Do hon members know that the  chiefs  of  Enron  took  out  R105
million just before  the  collapse  of  Enron,  but  then  refused  to  give
severance pay to thousands  and  thousands  of  employees?  [Interjections.]
There was ineffective  auditing,  conflicting  roles  between  auditors  and
consultants, the concealing of massive debt.  What  the  business  press  is
telling us is that greed  in  certain  American  corporations  has  replaced
sound business practices.

I am returning now to the relevance of all this to our Budget and  to  South
Africa. We all know that, by and large, the  South  African  banking  system
and  the  corporate  system  is  sound.  But,  nevertheless,   elements   of
uncertainty are creeping in because of certain similar  practices  in  South
African corporations. The Minister  referred  to  this  in  his  speech.  He
talked about the corporate failures  of  Macmed,  of  Leisurenet,  of  Regal
Treasury and above all, of Unifer. Unifer with its link to Saambou  and  the
link to Absa. The collapse of Unifer is an example of the kind  of  thing  I
am talking about and the kind of things that  were  raised  in  America  and
which are a matter of great concern. Unifer created a  bubble  of  loans  of
R5,5 billion, and R1,8 billion of that was bad debts.

In other words, they went out into the market, just like  Enron,  pretending
to be a sound corporation and then had to write off 50% of their  loans.  As
a result of that,  management  broke  down,  there  was  a  failure  of  due
diligence, their auditing collapsed and we have to ask ourselves - and  this
is what the ABSA director-general said - if the roots of  the  problem  were
in mismanagement, deception and fraud.

I want to come back to the  DP  policy  document.  Because  of  problems  in
corporate governance and weaknesses which are manifesting themselves in  the
bubble of investment that we have seen internationally,  hi-tech  stock  and
the collapse of the Nasdaq for example, because  of  that,  now  governments
are saying - not just the South African Government or communist  governments
- can we afford to have a weak government, can we afford to deregulate,  can
we afford to have minimum government interference?  Let  me  quote  Business
Week. This is what they say:


  Even conservatives have learnt a lesson. The clamour  for  accountability
  in the financial system means more rules and regulations in a sector that
  they have spent decades trying to deregulate.

I  go  back  to  the  document.  These  people   want   a   minimal   state.
[Interjections.] They want to deregulate  everything.  They  want  to  leave
everything to the individual entrepreneur. They want to leave everything  to
private enterprise. We say: No.  [Applause.]  Let  us  hear  it  again:  No!
[Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: No!

Prof B TUROK: There we are. There we are.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker ... [Interjections.]

Prof B TUROK: Please, say no to this gentleman.

HON MEMBERS: No!

Mr K M ANDREW:  Madam  Speaker,  may  I  ask  the  hon  member  a  question?
[Interjections.]
Prof B TUROK: Madam Speaker,  I  will,  if  you  give  me  extra  time.  The
Speaker's answer is no, so the answer is no.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, on  a  point  of  order:  Is  the  hon  member
allowed  to  make  selective  distorted  quotations   without   giving   the
reference? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, please  let  the  member  finish  his
speech.

Prof B TUROK: Madam  Speaker,  I  can  give  you  the  page  references  for
everything I have said.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, please just finish your speech.

Prof B TUROK: Madam Speaker, I have one minute left. If  you  give  me  time
... I will see hon Andrew afterwards and I will read him his own  documents.
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Poor Andrew, poor Andrew, poor Andrew!

Prof B TUROK: Let me tie all this up. South Africa  needs  a  strong  and  a
steady government. [Interjections.] We live  in  an  unstable  international
environment with a high degree of financial uncertainty,  and  the  pressure
on our rand is symptomatic of  that.  We  have  problems  in  the  financial
sector. There is massive international speculation.  The  dollar  is  flying
around without any control. The IMF itself says it is unable  to  track  the
movement of finances around the  world.  In  that  environment,  we  need  a
strong and steady  government.  If  the  DP  thinks  that  its  policies  of
individualism, free market, nonregulation, etc,  are  going  to  help  South
Africa, please tell them what we think: No! [Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: No!

The  MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  Madam  Speaker,  let  me  start  by  expressing
appreciation to the committee for the diligence of their hearings,  for  the
reports and also  for  the  debate  and  to  all  members  who  prepared  to
participate here this afternoon.

It is worth emphasising that this Budget is a progrowth Budget.
We find the evidence in the infrastructure spending, in the  tax  relief  to
reinforce household spending, in the further relief for small  business,  in
the accelerated depreciation  for  investment,  in  the  real  increases  in
social  transfers  to  households  and  in  the  continuing  enlargement  on
spending on education  and  skills  development.  But  it  is  important  to
recognise that South Africa is not an island.

We make our policies in a global environment, in a world where we have  seen
economic  slowdown  in  so  many  countries  that  are  like  South  Africa.
Malaysia, which  in  2000  grew  at  8,3%,  grew  at  0,3%  last  year.  The
Philippines, which grew at 4% in 2000, grew at 2,9% last year.  Brazil  grew
from 4,5% to 1,7% and Mexico from 6,9% to 0,7%. That is the world  that  one
makes policy in.

So, in looking at growth and at sustainable growth, one  has  to  understand
what the trends in the world are. So  when  people  ask  that  one  abstract
oneself from that world and pretend that one can  put  on  shutters  and  be
myopic about opportunities in the world, one will fail time and again.

Similarly, the issue of interest rates which  has  been  raised  here  is  a
complex issue, because in all of the countries that I have mentioned  -  and
I can extend the list - one will find this distortion and in all  developing
countries interest  rates  are  substantially  higher  than  in  the  highly
industrialised countries.

For poor countries, because we are dependent on capital,  we  have  not  had
the luxury of the 10 or 11 interest rate cuts that  one  has  been  able  to
effect in the United States  to  stimulate  development.  These  are  trends
which, if one is in the world, one has got  to  understand  and  take  one's
decisions in that world.

In respect of the points raised by the hon Bekker about interest rates,  the
Reserve Bank has a mandate given to it by the Constitution. It is a  mandate
to maintain price stability and it has to act within  that  environment.  It
is not pleasant.

I think these last two decisions by  the  governor  clearly  have  been  his
baptism of fire. I know that he was exceedingly tormented by what he had  to
consider in the monetary policy committee, which  concluded  its  work  this
afternoon. These things are not easy, but I think that in the world that  we
live in, we need to understand that those trends are there, rather  than  to
use interest rates repeatedly or to use the forward book, as has  been  done
in the past, because that creates a contingent liability  and  the  chickens
come home to roost later.

But before people think that we should dress in sackcloth  and  ashes  about
how bad South Africa is, the hon Ben Turok referred to  some  extracts  from
the Business Week, which  is  an  American  publication.  Now,  this  week's
edition talks about certain  risks  in  the  US  economy.  I  want  the  hon
Taljaard to hear this, because God lives in the US,  of  course  [Laughter.]
They talk about the fact that the net debt of the US will reach  nearly  5,8
trillion dollars by the end of 2006,  which  would  be  about  46%  of  that
year's GDP. In 1997 that debt was just 13%.

They go on to talk about the fact  that,  to  off-set  this  statistic   and
given the risk of capital flows, the US would  require  a  30%  increase  in
exports to halve the deficits  in  the  US  current  accounts  -  the  broad
measure of trade in goods services and investment income. The  30%  increase
in exports would be a stretch - quite impossible for the United States.

The same report goes on to calculate that  the  US  would  probably  need  a
depreciation in the dollar  of  some  43%.  There  is  an  imbalance  and  a
distortion here. So, before we beat our chests  about  the  depreciation  of
the rand, we must understand that these imbalances that  exist  now  in  the
dollar and the pound that are too strong, will cost exports  and  cost  jobs
in those economies going forward.

In the same kind of way, I am sorry that the hon Van der  Merwe  is  not  in
the House, because  the  same  edition  deals  with  crime  in  Europe.  For
instance, it says in respect of France: ``Crime:  hold on to that  cellphone
in Paris! Violent street robberies led by phone snatchings  are  up  23%  in
the past year.'' In Britain, it says,  robbery  had  surged  nearly  40%  in
London  since  April  2001  and  moved  into  rich  neighbourhoods  such  as
Twickenham.

In Spain, crime rose to 10,5% in 2001, leading to  increased  concern  about
immigration. It is a problem. It is a problem there,  as  it  is  a  problem
here. So let us stop beating our chests and let us start telling  the  truth
about  South  Africa.  [Interjections.]  That  is  what  the   international
investor council tells us to do. Let us not pretend that these problems  are
uniquely South African.
In the same way, when we look at the issue of jobs, the  hon  Holomisa  says
that Government must create jobs. Where is he? Where does he wake  up?  What
is he asking Government to do? I do not think  he  smelled  the  coffee,  he
smelled something else. There  is  clearly  a  problem  and,  again,  not  a
uniquely South African problem. There is a change in the composition of  the
labour market. That change is a change that is reflected, certainly, in  the
demand for those with tertiary skills, and there is negative  demand  across
the world for those with no skills. That is our  legacy.  That  is  what  we
have to deal with.  That is going to take more than a generation to  change,
but to get there, certainly, labour market policies need to take account  of
that reality.

We need to focus increasingly on skilling our people in  this  economy,  and
that takes time and resources and the  money  is  there.  It  is  not  about
flexible labour markets. It is about skilling people, because  cheap  labour
was apartheid labour. It is gone, it is gone for all time, it  is  gone  out
of South Africa and it is gone out of the world. [Applause.]

We need to reskill. We need to share jobs. We need look at issues  of  time.
I think there are a series of issues that we need to  reconsider  as  we  go
forward, but there are no pat populist solutions. So let us get that out  of
our heads and focus on the real  world,  because  hunger,  poverty  and  the
degradation of joblessness is  not  something  that  any  of  us  should  be
willing to countenance.

The changes in the global economy in the  last  while  and  the  changes  in
production are bigger, in fact, than the changes  that  came  about  in  the
Industrial Revolution. That is  what  we  need  to  understand.  That  is  a
challenge. It is not an ANC challenge. It is a South African challenge.

We said in the Budget as well that ...

... tlala e mo kotsing. [... hunger is in trouble.]

We must remain committed to that fight. We must ensure that  we  put  hunger
in danger every single day. It is a struggle we  are  fighting.  [Applause.]
When people in this House ignore the fact that poverty strategies are  dealt
with in this Budget across the board and they focus on one little thing,  it
is like going into the restaurant  and  ignoring  the  menu.  There  is  one
exotic meal that they want; there is an exotic meal that nobody  has  eaten,
but nobody has eaten it, probably for a good reason and,  because  of  that,
they say there is no food in the restaurant.

I think that the hon Turok has dealt with that kind of  confusion.  The  hon
Andrew is leaving the Portfolio Committee on Finance to  head  up  the  DP's
policy development. I wish him well. I want to thank him for his service  on
the Portfolio Committee on Finance, but I want to  say  that,  clearly,  our
majority is going to grow because of that kind of confusion.

He tries to be Red Ken. He comes with populist issues, but the  blue  is  so
deep, that it is just  a  purple  blob  that  comes  out  of  the  policies.
[Laughter.] It is indistinguishable. It is a hodgepodge of nothing  and  the
same kinds of views are articulated, if one listens to the hon  Andrew.  The
hon Raenette Taljaard's song this afternoon was: Privatise the poor,  it  is
somebody  else's  problem.  We  can  ignore   it.   Just   privatise   them.
[Interjections.]

I want to say to the hon Louw that  before  he  asks  anybody  like  me  ...
[Interjections.] There will be a second and third tranche, if  that  is  the
answer that hon member wants.

I want to say this to the hon Louw, the Rhodesian. I want to ask  him  where
he was when we  were  being  tortured  and  in  jail.  If  he  was  enjoying
privilege, he must never ask again where I stand, because he does  not  know
poverty, hunger, torture, oppression or repression. He  has  lived  off  the

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on  Finance  on  the  Social  Grants
     Appropriation Bill [B 9 - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 77), dated  13
     March 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Finance, having considered  the  subject
         of the Social Grants Appropriation Bill  [B  9  -  2002]  (National
         Assembly - sec 77), referred to it  and  classified  by  the  Joint

     Protection Support Appropriation Bill [B 10 - 2002] (National  Assembly
     - sec 77), dated 13 March 2002:

         of the Burundi Protection Support Appropriation Bill [B 10 -  2002]
         (National Assembly - sec 77), referred to it and classified by  the
         Joint Tagging Mechanism as  a  money  Bill,  reports  that  it  has
         agreed to the Bill.

3.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and  Local  Government
     on the Commission for the Promotion and Protection  of  the  Rights  of
     Cultural, Religious and Linguistic  Communities  Bill  [B  62  -  2001]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 13 March 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government,  having
         considered the subject of the  Commission  for  the  Promotion  and
         Protection of the Rights  of  Cultural,  Religious  and  Linguistic
         Communities Bill [B 62  -  2001]  (National  Assembly  -  sec  75),
         referred to it and classified by the Joint Tagging Mechanism  as  a
         section 75 Bill, reports the Bill with amendments [B 62A - 2001].


         The Committee further reports as follows:


         The Committee believes that the Commission for  the  Promotion  and
         Protection of the Rights  of  Cultural,  Religious  and  Linguistic
         Communities can serve a vital role in providing for the  expression
         of cultural, religious and linguistic rights in a way that  fosters
         nation-building. If the Commission is effective, it will  represent
         a significant further step in the consolidation of the  process  of
         our transition  from  a  divided  past  to  a  common  future  that
         acknowledges both our diversity and unity.


         The Committee  notes  that  the  Ministry  and  the  Department  of
         Provincial and Local Government undertook an  extensive  three-year
         process of consultation with a wide range  of  stakeholders  before
         finalising the Bill for introduction into Parliament.  The  process
         included consultative  conferences,  workshops,  provincial  public
         hearings  and  the  establishment   of   a   technical   committee,
         representative of key stakeholders, to process  earlier  drafts  of
         the Bill. In fact, the process was  so  consultative  that  several
         key stakeholders decided not to participate  in  the  parliamentary
         public  hearings  because  they  felt  that  they  had  been  given
         adequate opportunity to express their concerns.


         The Committee congratulates the Ministry  and  the  Department  for
         the sensitive way in which it has processed this Bill.


         The Commission is the only institution  "supporting  constitutional
         democracy", provided for in Chapter 9  of  the  Constitution,  that
         has not yet been established. With the passing of  this  Bill,  the
         Commission can now be established, and the Committee proposes  that
         the Commission be launched as soon as possible.  It  seems  to  the
         Committee that 24 September - Heritage Day - might  be  a  suitable
         day.


         The Committee recognises that there could  be  an  overlap  between
         the powers and functions of  the  Commission  and  those  of  other
         institutions, including the South African Human Rights  Commission,
         the Pan  South  African  Language  Board,  the  National  House  of
         Traditional Leaders and the Commission  for  Gender  Equality.  The
         Committee is also aware that questions are being raised  about  how
         productive and  effective  some  of  these  institutions  are,  and
         whether  the  country,  with  its  limited   resources   and   many
         challenges,   can   afford   to   have   so   many   constitutional
         institutions. The Committee believes that these  issues  should  be
         carefully considered at some appropriate stage.


         Within the prescripts of the Constitution, the Committee sought  to
         both define a specific role for the  Commission  and  to  encourage
         the Commission to co-operate effectively with  other  institutions.
         Section 6 in particular focuses on the need for this  co-operation.
         It is in the practical implementation of the  Bill,  however,  that
         certain issues around the specific role of the Commission, its  co-
         operation  with  other  institutions  and  its   productivity   and
         effectiveness will be addressed. We urge the Department and  to-be-
         established  Commission   to   ensure   that   these   issues   are
         appropriately dealt with.  We  will  certainly  be  monitoring  the
         process.


         In many senses, the proposed Commission is unique. There  are  few,
         if any, parallels for it anywhere in the world. The Commission  has
         a major responsibility to provide for the expression  of  diversity
         and unity in a mutually reinforcing way  as  part  of  our  nation-
         building process. We wish it well.
