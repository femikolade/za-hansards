                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mrs Z A KOTA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the statement by the Minister of Social  Development,  the  hon
       Zola Skweyiya, that the National Lottery Fund has  so  far  benefited
       only gamblers and has not reached poverty alleviation projects;


  (2) believes that the principal beneficiaries of funds generated  by  the
       national  lottery  system  should  be  civil  society   organisations
       involved in meaningful projects that seek to fight poverty; and


  (3) calls on the National Lottery Fund Board  to  review  its  allocation
       criteria and to ensure that it targets  civil  society  organisations
       that are working on programmes which address the plight of the poor.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


     (1)    notes that -
       (a)  the DA opposes presidential pardons  which  amount  to  backdoor
           amnesties and condemned the pardon of Mr Dumisani Ncamazana;


       (b)  the DA described the arrest and subsequent release of  Ncamazana
           concerning the Whitaker murder as a total botch-up;


       (c)  the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Development  demanded
           an apology from Mr Tony Leon on behalf of Mr Ncamazana; and


       (d)  Mr Ncamazana has now been re-arrested on two charges of  murder;
           and


    (2)      therefore  demands  that  the   Minister   for   Justice   and
           Constitutional  Development   apologise   to   Mr   Tony   Leon.
           [Applause.]

Mr T E VEZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of this House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that according to the Medical Research Council (MRC) in KwaZulu-
       Natal, there is a high incidence of substance abuse among  pupils  at
       rural secondary schools in the province;


  (2) further notes that according to the MRC, drug abuse in  South  Africa
       is on the increase; and


  (3) urges the relevant  authorities  and  various  role-players  to  work
       together in setting up the structures needed to wipe out drug  abuse,
       especially in schools.

Ms M A MOLEBATSI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  top  officials  of  approximately  80  countries,  including  10
           African heads  of  state,  the  Canadian  Prime  Minister,  Jean
           Chretien, and United States Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell,
           met in an all-day special session of the United Nations  General
           Assembly on 16 September 2002 to discuss the New Partnership for
           Africa's Development; and


       (b)  in his address to this special  session  President  Thabo  Mbeki
           said: ``The African Union hopes that  the  United  Nations  will
           support the peoples of Africa as we engage in  the  struggle  to
           eradicate poverty and underdevelopment in our continent'';


  (2) further notes that the international  community  has  reaffirmed  its
       support for Nepad in this special session; and


  (3) commends President Thabo Mbeki and other African heads of  state  for
       mobilising the international community to continue to support Nepad.

Mnr J W LE ROUX: Mev die Speaker, hiermee  gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag van die Huis sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  dr Rocco Knobel,  voormalige  hoofdirekteur  van  die  Nasionale
           Parkeraad, Sondag oorlede is, en dat hy hierdie pos  vir  bykans
           drie dekades beklee het;


       (b)  dr Knobel een van die pionierbewaarders van ons erfenis was,  en
           dat  onder  sy   bekwame   leierskap   talle   nasionale   parke
           geproklameer is,  onder  andere  die  wÃªreldbekende  Tsitsikamma
           Mariene Park; en
       (c)  die besondere voorbeeld van bewaring en toewyding wat hy  gestel
           het, sal voortleef in die  bestuur  van  die  huidige  nasionale
           parke; en


  (2) simpatiseer met sy naasbestaandes en vriende.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Dr Rocco Knobel, former Chief Director  of  the  National  Parks
           Board, passed away on Sunday; and that he filled  this  position
           for nearly three decades;


       (b)  Dr Knobel was one of  the  pioneering  conservationists  of  our
           heritage and that under his able leadership many national  parks
           were proclaimed, inter alia, the world-famous Tsitsikamma Marine
           Park; and


       (c)  the exceptional example of conservation and dedication which  he
           set, will live on in the  management  of  the  current  national
           parks; and


  (2) sympathises with his next of kin and friends.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, at the next sitting  of  the  House  I  will
move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay that the settlement  between  Cape  PLC  and  South
       African victims of asbestosis has not been honoured,  and  that  Cape
       PLC has reneged on the payout of  damages  even  after  receiving  an
       extension of the deadline;


  (2) further notes that the case will in all likelihood return to  the  UK
       courts, which may result in  many  more  months  passing  before  the
       victims receive compensation;


  (3) condemns the fact that the continued  delays  on  the  part  of  this
       company are leading  to  unnecessary  suffering  and  death  for  the
       victims of asbestosis; and


  (4) calls upon the Government to do whatever is  within  its  ability  to
       ensure that Cape PLC complies with the original settlement  in  order
       to avoid another lengthy round of legal proceedings.

Ms H M MPAKA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  ceasefire talks between the Burundi government and the  National
           Liberation Forces will resume on Thursday,  19  September  2002;
           and


       (b)  Deputy President Jacob Zuma  will  chair  and  facilitate  these
           talks;


  (2) believes that Africa's development and prosperity depend on  building
       peace, security and stability on the continent;


  (3) commends the South African Government for its determination  and  for
       consistently working towards the realisation of peace on the  African
       continent; and


  (4)  wishes  delegates  to  the  peace  talks  every  success  in   their
       deliberations on Thursday.

[Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting of the House I will move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that a deadly detonator exploded at Levana Primary
       School when a young boy, who took it from his teacher's desk, dropped
       it in front of his classroom;


  (2) further notes that after searching the school, another schoolboy  was
       found with 11 other detonators on him;


  (3) commends Superintendent Govender and her staff from Steenberg  police
       station for their dedication to the school,  and  for  keeping  their
       promise to be there for both the Levana and Hillwood Primary Schools,
       especially during the morning and in the afternoon when the  learners
       are dismissed from school;


  (4) also commends the teachers and staff in these  violence-ridden  areas
       for going out daily amidst the gangster violence and negotiating  the
       danger, and putting the learners' education above their  own  safety;
       and


  (5) calls on the Government to ensure that the decision they made to make
       all schools weapon-free zones is  carried  out  under  the  strictest
       conditions possible, and to put in place extra  measures  to  protect
       the teachers and children from the violence that  has  ravaged  their
       communities in the past.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move as follows  at
the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that, despite our  advances  in  democracy,  the  shocking  and
       unprecedented level of violent crime is  a  cause  of  real  concern,
       particularly with regard to the most vulnerable  people  -  children,
       women and the aged;


  (2) notes that when the PAC called for firm and harsh measures, there was
       scorn and ridicule in some quarters, particularly from those who  had
       not experienced crime at first hand;


  (3) further notes that law-enforcement officials are being  attacked  and
       killed daily, thereby showing that no one in the community can really
       feel secure and that the boldness and arrogance of the criminals  are
       highly provocative and frightening;


  (4) observes that long sentences in our comfortable prisons do  not  seem
       to be a deterrent, particularly  as  prisoners  remain  a  burden  on
       society, including those who have been brutalised; and


  (5) therefore calls for a  radical  review  of  our  judicial  and  penal
       system, including the holding of a referendum  to  increase  physical
       punishment and pain.

Mr B W KANNEMEYER: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the current financial crisis in the City of Cape Town after less
           than two years under DA rule; and


       (b)  the plundering of  the  city's  reserves  from  a  healthy  R1,5
           billion under the ANC in 2000 to a mere R123 million in the bank
           today under the DP;


  (2) also notes that the DA council's approach to solving this dilemma  is
       to punish the poorest of the poor by -


       (a)  closing facilities;
       (b)  retrenching staff;
       (c)  decreasing service levels; and
       (d)  reducing provision for the indigent;


  (3) further notes -


       (a)  the exorbitant performance bonuses paid to the executives of the
           city; and


       (b)  the DA's much vaunted commitment to sound financial  management,
           clean and transparent governance and working for all the people;
           and


  (4) calls on the DA to hold transparent and  open  public  investigations
       into allegations of financial mismanagement and maladministration  in
       the unicity of Cape Town.

[Applause.]

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Mpumalanga under 19 boys' hockey team,  selected  on  merit,
           consisted of only black players;


       (b)  the provincial government insisted that the team  be  made  more
           racially representative by  replacing  some  team  members  with
           white players; and


       (c)  the Hockey Association Chairman, Richard Prinsloo, has  resigned
           in protest at this political interference; and


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  this interference in team selection  is  proof  that  the  ANC's
           obsession with racial quotas overrides  its  commitment  to  the
           principle of merit in sport; and


       (b)   the  ANC   is   perpetuating   racial   consciousness   amongst
           schoolchildren instead  of  promoting  excellence  by  replacing
           meritorious black players with white players who are  tokens  in
           the quota madness.

[Applause.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Monday, 16 September, was World Ozone Day;


       (b)  the world recognises the importance of keeping the issue of  the
           ozone sharply in focus because of its importance to  the  health
           of the planet; and


       (c)  we too need to provide leadership in order that all citizens are
           warned of the danger of cancer from  frequent  exposure  to  the
           sun; and


  (2) calls on all South Africans to treat environmental matters  with  the
       seriousness they deserve.

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that on 16 September 2002 Lebanon marked the  20th  anniversary
       of the massacre by Israeli forces of Palestinian  refugees  in  Sabra
       and Shatila in the then Israeli-occupied Beirut;


  (2) believes that the killing of innocent  civilians,  including  unarmed
       women and children, is a  gross  violation  of  human  rights  and  a
       serious crime against humanity;
  (3) condemns the continued military occupation of  Palestinian  territory
       and the terrorist actions by the Israeli forces against the people of
       Palestine; and


  (4) calls on the  peoples  of  the  world  to  work  towards  a  peaceful
       resolution of the Middle East crisis.

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1)  welcomes  the  SABC's  fierce  fight   against   the   Minister   of
       Communications in order to protect its independence;


  (2) reminds the Minister of the role  and  impact  of  the  media  as  an
       invaluable source of information in our society, the media being  the
       medium through which society voices its opinions and concerns;


  (3) agrees that it is essential for any democracy that the media  upholds
       the values of freedom of expression,  media  independence,  democracy
       and human rights; and


  (4) calls on the Minister to uphold these values and not to become Attila
       the Hun, taking us back to the Dark Ages of state broadcasters.

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the expressed willingness of  Iraq  to  readmit  UN  weapons
       inspectors into the country in the interests of world peace;


  (2) calls upon Iraq to play open cards and to co-operate  fully  with  UN
       weapons inspectors;


  (3) calls upon the US and its allies to accept  the  findings  of  a  UN-
       supervised inspection;


  (4) condemns in the strongest terms statements expressing  scepticism  by
       the US and its allies on the move by Iraq;


  (5) trusts that such statements  are  not  a  smokescreen  to  eventually
       attack the territorial integrity of Iraq and  remove  its  president;
       and


  (6) calls upon all countries in the Middle  East,  including  Israel,  to
       respect and implement the UN resolutions.

[Applause.]

                          SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(1)

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam  Speaker,  on  behalf  of
the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, I move the  draft  resolution  printed
in his name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That Rule 253(1) be suspended for the purposes of conducting  the  Second
  Reading debate on the Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill  [B  31B  -  2002]
  (National Assembly - sec 76).

Agreed to.

                          DISASTER MANAGEMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Madam  Speaker  and
hon members, the United Nations estimates that a severe disaster can cost  a
developed country up to 1,5% of its  GDP,  but  it  can  cost  a  developing
country up to 16% of its GDP.

Moenie slaap nie, asseblief. [Please do not sleep.]

For a developing country,  such  as  South  Africa,  it  is  a  priority  to
minimise the impact and cost of disasters so that resources can be used  for
pressing ongoing development needs. The impact and cost  of  a  disaster  is
mitigated by the state of preparedness of the country concerned.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' Handbook for  Emergencies
states that sustainable development is society's investment in  the  future,
that investment will  be  squandered  if  it  is  not  protected  adequately
against the risk of disaster and it goes on to say that disasters are  first
and foremost a  major  threat  to  development  and,  specifically,  to  the
development of the poorest  and  most  marginalised  people  in  the  world.
Disasters seek out the poor and ensure they stay poor.

Poor people usually have little choice as to where they reside.  They  often
live in dangerous or marginalised areas of our society. They are  unable  to
afford structures, for instance well-constructed houses, that would  protect
them from disasters such as floods. As a result, they are  often  completely
devastated when disaster hits, often without  insurance,  savings  or  other
possessions to replace the possessions they have lost.

The poorest people in a society, and particularly in South Africa  with  its
history of active marginalisation, are the most  economomically  vulnerable.
They are often placed on the  periphery  of  productive  economic  activity.
This means that those who can least afford it are the most affected.

In one of the most recent examples of a natural disaster  in  South  Africa,
floods, extremely cold weather and deep  snow  repeatedly  hit  the  Eastern
Cape  and  parts  of  KwaZulu-Natal  in  a  very  short   space   of   time.
Infrastructure  such  as  roads,  storm  water   systems,   dams,   bridges,
electricity supply lines and properties  were  severely  damaged.  Livestock
was lost and people died.

Disasters tend  to  erode  hard-earned  livelihoods  and  leave  communities
bereft of a means of subsistence. Government therefore has an obligation  to
protect communities from disasters.  Effective  disaster  management  is  an
integral part of sustainable development.

The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, agreed  to  at  the
World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development   held   recently,   makes   the
observation that the global environment  continues  to  suffer.  It  further
states:


  ... loss of biodiversity continues, fish stocks continue to be  depleted,
  desertification claims more and more fertile land, the adverse effects of
  climate change are already evident, natural disasters are  more  frequent
  and more devastating and developing countries more vulnerable,  and  air,
  water and marine pollution continue to rob millions of a decent life.

The resultant plan of implementation makes specific reference  to  the  need
in  Africa  to  deal  effectively  with  natural  disasters  and  conflicts,
including their environmental impact -


  ... through efforts and initiatives, at all levels, to: provide financial
  and technical  assistance  to  strengthen  ...  institutional  and  human
  capacity,  including  at  the  local  level,   for   effective   disaster
  management, including observation and early warning systems, assessments,
  prevention, preparedness, response and recovery; provide support  ...  to
  better deal with the displacement  of  people  as  a  result  of  natural
  disasters and conflicts, and put in place rapid response mechanisms.

As Government, we believe that disaster management is an  integral  part  of
the process of working for  sustainable  development.  This  necessitates  a
paradigm shift from a reactive role,  focusing  exclusively  on  relief  and
recovery, to a proactive disaster management system  with  the  emphasis  on
prevention, risk reduction and preparedness. This  is  critical  to  protect
the interests of all our people, in particular the poorest of the poor.

Increased  preparedness  will  be  assisted  by  the  integration  and   co-
ordination of different information management systems for the  purposes  of
developing,  more  accurately,  early  warning  systems.  Another   critical
element of preparedness is the harnessing of the energies  of  local  people
in  disaster  management,  both  in  terms  of  civic  education   and   the
organisation of communities to cope with disasters. This Bill  provides  for
both.

Our people need to be taught about the dangers of disasters,  such  as  veld
fires and the risk of lighting fires in dry bushy areas. Civic education  is
critical to a preventive strategy. If people are more informed and aware  of
the dangers facing them, the risk of these dangers is  lessened.  Similarly,
the more prepared a local community is to deal with a disaster,  the  better
the community will cope with it when it finally strikes.

The Bill makes specific  reference  to  the  need  for  disaster  management
volunteers. It is critical that local  organisational  structures,  such  as
ward committees and community-based organisations, take up the challenge  of
mobilising local resources - human  and  material  -  for  use  in  disaster
management and mitigation.

In conclusion, let me just say that  although  South  Africa,  as  with  any
other country, is sometimes unable to predict or prevent disasters, we  can,
through disaster management legislation, be better prepared  for  disasters.
This Bill provides for the development of  an  integrated  and  co-ordinated
disaster management policy that focuses on preventing or reducing  the  risk
of disasters, mitigating the severity of disasters, emergency  preparedness,
rapid and effective response to  disasters  and  postdisaster  recovery  the
establishment of national,  provincial  and  municipal  disaster  management
centres and disaster management volunteers.

I am convinced that the Bill before hon members meets  these  objectives.  I
am  therefore  pleased  to  introduce  this  Bill  before  this  House   for
discussion. [Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy Minister, hon  members,  it  gives
me great pleasure today to inform this House that the DA will be  supporting
this Bill. [Interjections.] The DA is committed to making  a  difference  in
this country, and we will support what we believe to be good legislation.
In one sense, no legislation is  more  necessary  than  this  because  South
Africa,  under  the  ANC  Government,  has  become  an   ongoing   disaster.
[Interjections.] With Aids spreading like  wildfire  whilst  the  Government
conducts endless academic debates as to its origins; the quite diplomacy  in
Zimbabwe,  whilst  6  million  people  are   threatened   with   starvation;
unemployment mounting and causing untold misery  and  hardship;  poverty  on
the increase - over the weekend we all read  about  the  children  dying  of
malnutrition in the Eastern  Cape  because  of  inefficient  administration;
millions accumulating from the  lottery  and  not  getting  through  to  the
charities crying out for money;  municipal  mismanagement  causing  mounting
deficits  at  local  level;  and,  with  a  score  of  other  bunglings  and
bumblings, we certainly  have  need  of  measures  to  manage  some  of  the
disasters we do not cause. [Interjections.]

But, in all seriousness, I want to warn this House. We  can  have  the  best
legislation in the world, but words on paper mean nothing  unless  there  is
the capacity to deliver, the will to take action and the resources  for  the
task. This Government has become notorious  for  being  long  on  words  and
short on delivery. It must not happen in the field of  disaster  management.
To quote an infamous South African  a  generation  ago,  ``the  consequences
would be too ghastly to contemplate".

The Bill provides for an integrated, co-ordinated and  uniform  approach  to
disaster management by all  three  spheres  of  government.  It  focuses  on
disaster  management  as   a   continual   and   integrated   multisectoral,
multidisciplinary process of planning and implementation of measures.  These
aim to prevent and reduce the risk of disasters, mitigate  the  severity  or
consequences  of  disasters,  ensure  readiness  to  deal   with   impending
disasters, and respond to disasters so as to restore normality.

The several natural disasters of the last few years - the floods, fires  and
tornadoes - have shown how it is always, as the Deputy Minister has  pointed
out, the poor people who are the most vulnerable. They  are  the  ones  that
suffer the most.
In the 2001 floods on the Cape Flats, 4Â 000 people sought temporary  shelter
in community centres. The Salvation Army and  the  Red  Cross  had  to  feed
5Â 000  people  daily.  The  cost  was  nearly  R30  000  a  day.  Where   do
municipalities find that sort of money in an emergency?

In Johannesburg they have a R40 million state-of-the-art  call  centre,  but
nobody knows what the emergency number is. Now what earthly good is that  in
an emergency? The people of South Africa  need  a  short,  simple  emergency
number such as 911. It must be the same throughout the country.

Firefighting  equipment,  ambulances,  emergency  telephone  numbers,   call
centres - all need to be functional for this Bill to have  effect.  Building
regulations must be enforced, and flood plain  lines  foreseen  to  pre-empt
the effect of disasters. Communication and early  warning  systems  will  be
vital for the management of disaster.

The Bill answers the  questions:  Who  will  classify  disasters  as  local,
provincial or national disasters, and how  will  they  be  funded?  It  also
defines what the communication links will be in an emergency. It calls  upon
municipalities, provinces and  the  national  Government  to  be  proactive,
again, as our Deputy Minister said, so that the risk  of  disasters  can  be
reduced and prevented.

When floods hit the Northern Province, now Limpopo, in  February  2000,  the
Sowetan carried the headline: ``Empty promises as  flood  victims  suffer''.
It is a heartbreaking account of interviews conducted with victims  in  some
of the hardest hit regions. They were told of  money  being  made  available
and of the plans to build houses.

Maria Chauke, an  unemployed  mother  of  two,  from  Magomane  village,  in
Malamulele, said, ``Some rogue officials  arrived  here  shortly  after  the
floods and said that our village was a disaster.  They  promised  to  repair
our collapsed houses. That was the last time we saw them.'' Others spoke  of
having ``lost hope''. The  article  continues:  ``The  excellent  plans  the
Government has for the victims of this natural disaster  remain  meaningless
until the state machinery becomes more efficient''.

The challenge for us in this House is not how good this Bill  is  on  paper,
but how efficiently it will be implemented on the  ground.  [Interjections.]
I wish here, at this point, to thank  the  department  for  all  their  hard
work, and also Dr Ailsa Holloway for her endless patience  in  assisting  us
with the processing of this Bill. [Interjections.] I also say thanks  to  Mr
Olifant. [Applause.]

Mr B M SOLO: Madam Speaker,  Deputy  Minister  Botha,  hon  members  of  the
House, for the past four years or so we have constantly witnessed  different
kinds of disasters.

The  consequences  of  disasters  caused  by  floods,  veld   fires,   heavy
snowfalls, heavy rains and strong winds are  increasing  dramatically.  This
can be ascribed not so much to the  severity  of  the  events,  but  to  the
growing vulnerability of poor people to these events.

All these  disasters  carry  with  them  misery  and  hardship.  The  recent
disaster in the Eastern Cape is a case in point  -  first  there  were  veld
fires, followed by snow, heavy rains, storms and floods. These were  natural
disasters; they were not caused by the ANC Government or the ANC. We  cannot
stop them. But  the  Disaster  Management  Bill  attempts  to  address  such
situations.

Parliament will recall that the original  Bill  was  introduced  around  the
beginning of 2001. The committee received a wide range of  submissions  from
different sectors  of  our  communities.  Similarly,  public  hearings  were
attended by many role-players  and  organisations  of  civil  society.  They
included the following: the Disaster Mitigation for Sustainable  Livelihoods
Project of the University of Cape Town; the  Disaster  Management  Institute
of SA; the SA Insurance  Association;  the  National  House  of  Traditional
Leaders; Technikon SA; the  Amalgamated  Services  for  Concerned  Residents
Association; Agri SA; and Groundwork.

Towards the end of 2001, the Bill was withdrawn in order for the  Department
of Provincial and Local Government to comply with section  9  of  the  Local
Government: Municipal Systems Act so that the FFC could make  an  assessment
of the financial implications of the Bill. Thereafter, it  was  reintroduced
in the first half of this year.

The committee debated  extensively  on  the  provisions  of  the  Bill,  and
seriously noted the inputs made by all those who made  presentations  during
public hearings. Most of their views have been taken into consideration.

The Disaster Management Bill is quite an advanced Bill as it has taken  into
consideration what exists  throughout  the  world.  Most  of  the  committee
deliberations took place while disasters were occurring here  in  Cape  Town
and throughout the world. These events helped as the committee  was  exposed
to reality, and, as such, we had to craft the Bill in such  a  way  that  it
would help significantly to improve our  strategies  on  how  to  deal  with
vulnerability, risk and response.
If one looks at chapter 1, clause 1, one  will  clearly  see  how  the  Bill
would  help  communities  in  terms  of   its   definition   of   ``disaster
management''. The Bill aims to provide mechanisms to prevent or  reduce  the
risks of disasters. It is aimed at enabling our communities to mitigate  the
severity  or  consequences  of  disasters.  The  Bill   promotes   emergency
preparedness,  rapid  and  effective  response  to  disasters,  and   speedy
postdisaster recovery and rehabilitation.

As such, the Bill provides a paradigm shift  in  understanding  and  dealing
with disasters. The new approach is not only modelled for  the  postdisaster
recovery phase, but also focuses on  predisaster  risk  reduction,  training
and awareness. It seeks to reduce the probability and severity  of  disaster
occurrences through developmental action and planning.  As  such,  the  Bill
incorporates  Vuk'uzenzele  and  Masakhane  as  it   emphasises   indigenous
knowledge and community participation.

To this end, President  Mbeki  has  stated  that,  ``  ...  this  year,  the
Government will work further to strengthen its links with the masses of  our
people''. He goes further: ``In pushing back the frontiers  of  poverty,  we
shall do this in partnership with many in our society who are ready to  lend
a hand in the national effort to build a better life.''

The Disaster Management Bill puts a lot of emphasis on  the  following:  co-
ordinating preparedness  and  building  a  rapid  and  spontaneous  response
capability, and capacity-building, not only of Government but  also  of  the
private   sector,   nongovernmental   institutions,   civil   society    and
communities.

The Bill provides a  strategy  to  reduce  risk  and  the  vulnerability  of
communities, especially poor and previously disadvantaged  communities,  and
this includes a framework  for  community  participation  and  an  awareness
programme. This framework also provides for the incorporation of  indigenous
knowledge and the prominent role of traditional leaders.

We would be undermining the debate and the Bill if we did  not  observe  the
trends in our country. In and around 27 to 30 July ...

... kulo nyaka  kube  khona  izinhlekelele  eziningi  lapha  eWestern  Cape.
Sizibonile izimvula  ezinkulu,  siyibonile  nenkanyamba,  ziqhubeka  laphaya
endaweni  okuthiwa  iKhosovo,  Sweet  Homes,  Phola  Park  nase-KTC.   Lokhu
kubangele inhlupheko kubantu abangange-2000. (Translation of Zulu  paragraph
follows.)

[... this year there were many crises here  in  the  Western  Cape.  We  saw
heavy rains, and we even experienced a tornado.  These  crises  occurred  in
Kosovo, Sweet Homes, Phola Park and KTC. This has caused about 2 000  people
to suffer.]

In  or  around  9  July  of  this  year,  at  Jagersfontein  and  Ottoshoop,
devastating  grass  and  bush  fires  destroyed  about  17Â 000  hectares  of
grassland, and three people died and six were injured. A further  veld  fire
destroyed many hectares of grassland. In the North  West  province  a  train
travelling from Warrenton to  Naledi  derailed  and  crashed,  causing  veld
fires that destroyed 4Â 500 hectares of grazing land and killing  five  sheep
and seven goats.

In Mpumalanga we  experienced  devastating  veld  fires  in  the  Morgenzon,
Amersfoort and Ermelo areas. A considerable amount of infrastructure  damage
was caused. Six people were  killed  and  568  were  injured.  In  addition,
68Â 000 hectares of grazing land, 41Â 000  hectares  of  maize  fields,  1Â 000
hectares of plantation and  more  than  100  informal  houses  were  totally
destroyed. We have seen these trends moving to Gauteng,  KwaZulu-Natal,  the
Free State, the Eastern Cape in particular, and finally to Limpopo.

This is a debate that we need  to  take  very  seriously.  We  all  have  to
contribute towards dealing with disasters. It therefore  becomes  imperative
to  note  the  significance  and  the  wisdom  of  producing  the   Disaster
Management  Bill.  The  Bill  seeks  to  address  all   the   aforementioned
scenarios.

Chapter 2 of the Bill makes provision for the creation and establishment  of
structures, such as the intergovernmental committee, which  will  deal  with
issues of  disasters,  and  makes  provision  for  the  establishment  of  a
disaster management framework including  the  establishment  of  a  disaster
management forum.

Chapter 3 deals with the establishment  of  a  disaster  management  centre,
which will  facilitate,  develop  and  co-ordinate  issues  around  disaster
management. Chapters  4  and  5  provide  for  a  provincial  and  municipal
disaster management framework, and the establishment of disaster  management
centres, with  power  given  to  provinces  and  municipalities  to  declare
provincial and local disasters.

Chapter 6 deals with funding, rehabilitation and guidelines,  while  Chapter
7 deals with the whole question of volunteers. The significant part of  this
chapter is clause 58(6)(b), which reads thus:


  This section  does  not  preclude  any  number  of  persons  from  taking
  reasonable steps to deal with a disaster in an appropriate manner until a
  municipality  takes  responsibility  for  that   disaster,   and,   where
  appropriate, to continue dealing with the disaster under the  control  of
  the municipality.

It is therefore imperative in this day and age that the Disaster  Management
Bill becomes relevant. However, to ensure a  sustainable  future,  the  Bill
must become more  relevant  as  it  begins  to  provide  for  a  process  of
gradually pushing back the frontiers of poverty, and as it attempts to  save
our people from being swept away to their graves by floods  that  have  been
without precedent in recent history, according to President Thabo Mbeki.

The  Bill  attempts  to  ensure  a  better  life  and  an  escape  from  the
devastating effects of disasters. Finally, it suggests various measures  for
risk reduction and disaster prevention and mitigation, and  states  that  it
is required that disaster management issues form an  integral  part  of  the
IDP process in which communities have an important role to play.

In conclusion, let me acknowledge the following people  who  gave  me  their
full support during the processing of this Bill.  Firstly,  the  chairperson
of the committee, Comrade Yunus Carrim for assigning me  the  responsibility
of processing this Bill. This has been a very  empowering  process  for  me.
When I started out I knew nothing about the topic  of  disaster  management,
now I feel very confident. Also, let  me  acknowledge  my  comrades  in  the
study group who cannot be left out owing to the  support  and  respect  they
displayed, save that they called me ``Mr Disaster''.

Secondly, I extend special thanks to the members of the committee for  their
support,  which  has  contributed  to  my  ability  to  successfully   chair
committee meetings without confusing issues. Thirdly, I want  to  thank  the
department, especially Mr Louis Buys for always being there to  provide  the
necessary support, for  his  willingness  to  help  and  for  his  efficient
response  to  disasters  that  occurred  throughout  the  country   and   in
neighbouring states. I thank Dr Bouwer as well. His technical expertise  and
attitude of always being willing to go the extra mile make us feel proud.

The  University  of  Cape  Town's  Disaster   Mitigation   for   Sustainable
Livelihoods  Project  has  been  the  most  important  partner  during   the
processing of the Bill. We hope that the  partnership  we  have  built  over
this period will continue to benefit  our  vulnerable  communities  as  this
programme is a response to the President's call to lend a helping  hand.  We
hope the enthusiasm of and commitment  by  especially  Dr  Holloway  and  Ms
Christine Nomdo will be an  inspiration  to  other  institutions  of  higher
learning to lend a hand in the process of  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty. [Applause.]

Mr P F SMITH: Chairperson, it  is  always  a  pleasure  to  be  involved  in
legislation which enjoys multiparty support. Let me say, first of all,  that
there is an urgent need for this legislation because,  currently,  disasters
are dealt with in terms  of  a  civil  protection  approach  which,  crudely
speaking, is a reactive and response-driven approach. And, of  course,  this
approach is also inadequate because it deals more  with  the  symptoms  than
the causes of disasters. It is  an  approach  centred  on  responding  to  a
disaster,  or  an  imminent  disaster,  rather  than  preventing   it   from
occurring.

To use an analogy, it is an approach which looks at providing tents  in  the
event of a flood, rather than  ensuring  that  people  are  not  victims  of
floods in the first place.

An HON MEMBER: How do you do that?

Mr P F SMITH: Well, read the Bill; you will find out.

We are living in an era of heightened susceptibility to  disasters,  whether
man-made or otherwise. The issue is not simply one of  an  increased  number
of disasters in a neutral sense  but,  equally,  is,  a  function  of  human
interaction with the environment, which  is  often  very  problematic  -  in
respect of floods, for example, it is the issue of settlement patterns.

In addition to human interaction, not  only  do  there  appear  to  be  more
disasters  and   worse   disasters,   but   it   is   the   poor   who   are
disproportionately affected. It is not the rich who live  next  to  chemical
plants. It is not the rich who live behind explosives factories or  next  to
oil pipelines. It is the poor, of course,  and  it  is  they  who  are  more
vulnerable. So it is not that the better off are not affected  by  disasters
at all, but that they are less  vulnerable  and  are  more  easily  able  to
recover from disasters. The poor, however, when hit by adversity,  suffer  a
great deal and often lack the  means  to  recuperate  or  to  restore  their
position.

So it is this  combination  of  heightened  vulnerability  to  disasters  in
general, coupled with the devastating effects on  the  poor  in  particular,
that  necessitates  a  fresh  approach  towards  disaster  management.  This
approach is really international best practice  that  is  involved  in  this
Bill, in which the primary stress is placed upon prevention  and  mitigation
- upon preventing disasters from occurring  and  from  mitigating  disasters
and the consequences of disasters.
This is an admirable approach and it does not, of course, diminish the  need
for adequate response - an adequate emergency preparedness - but  it  merely
shifts the emphasis towards  preventing  disasters  from  occurring  in  the
first place. We are satisfied that this is an important step  in  the  right
direction.

Of course, most disasters show little respect for  borders  or  governments,
and it is imperative as well that  the  Bill  provides  for  a  co-ordinated
response by all three spheres of government, according each a specific  role
and, of course, a complementary role. This is not an  easy  task  given  our
system of governance.

In respect of this Bill, the aspects involved include the classification  of
disasters, the apportionment of  primary  responsibility  in  responding  to
disasters, the co-ordination and integration of disaster  management  plans,
and the like. All in all,  we  are  satisfied  that  the  Bill  indeed  does
provide  for  an  integrated  approach  and  a  co-ordinated   approach   by
Government.
Here, we also want to refer positively to  the  requirement  that  we  as  a
committee inserted in the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act  a  couple
of years back stipulating that prior to any new function being  assigned  to
local government, certain consultative  steps  should  be  taken  including,
importantly, the fact that the FFC should be requested  to  investigate  and
report upon the consequences of such an assignment.

Now, unfortunately, when the Bill was introduced last year, public  hearings
were held and the committee ended up processing some 95%  of  the  Bill,  in
fact, before the Minister withdrew the Bill in order  that  it  comply  with
the  requirements  of  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Systems  Act.  In
parenthesis, I notice that the memorandum to the Bill makes no reference  to
this, which is somewhat surprising. Be that as it  may,  the  Bill  we  have
just processed incorporates all the  amendments  that  we  made  last  year,
leaving relatively little to be done this time around.

I  want  to  conclude  by  making  reference  to  a  financial  matter.  The
memorandum  to  the  Bill  states  that  the   financial   consequences   or
implications of the Bill on provinces and on municipalities are  negligible.
Now, this may well be true in the sense that a negligible sum  of  money  is
required to kickstart the implementation of the Bill, but, in  reality,  the
financial consequences of disaster management  are  far  more  complex  than
simply the quantum required to implement this Bill in  the  first  instance.
There are a whole  lot  of  complex  matters  that  the  FFC  in  particular
investigated, and it has made recommendations to the executive.

According to the FFC, there will be finance required, even in the  immediate
stages, to meet the start-up costs and ongoing institutional costs, as  well
as the development of prevention and mitigation strategies. These  all  have
to be funded. In the greater scheme of  things  it  may  well  be  that  the
initial sum  required  is  not  a  huge  amount,  but  there  will  be  many
municipalities, I venture to suggest, that will not be  doing  much  in  the
way of disaster management until funding is made available.  So  even  minor
levels of funding may be crucial in getting this off the ground  and  across
the country by all municipalities, in particular.

The IFP is strongly opposed to unfunded mandates and does not  believe  that
new  functions  should   be   assigned   to   municipalities   without   due
consideration being given to the financial implications of  such  functions.
So we really do urge that the executive pay due regard to the report of  the
committee, which itself has taken the recommendations of the FFC  reasonably
seriously.

In conclusion, we support the Bill. We think it is an excellent Bill.

Mr  P  UYS:  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  existing  South   African
legislation does not deal adequately with  disaster  management.  The  major
shortcoming is that it focuses on dealing with  disasters  after  they  have
occurred  and  largely  ignores  prevention  and  risk  reduction.  Previous
policies focused predominantly on relief and recovery efforts.
This new approach involves a shift away from the perception  that  disasters
are rare occurrences, managed by emergency rescue and support  services,  to
that of prevention, aimed at saving lives and protecting assets before  they
are lost. This Bill  also  seeks  to  eliminate  the  confusion  created  by
current legislation regarding declarations of disaster, and recognises  that
successful  disaster  management  can  only  be  achieved  if  a  spirit  of
partnership  and  co-operative  governance  is  adhered  to  by  Government,
particularly because of the crosscutting nature of disaster management.

Disaster management is a challenge that poses immense  responsibilities.  If
approached correctly it could become one of the most important  elements  in
building a sustainable society, with the ultimate goal  being  to  integrate
disaster management into the process of development planning.

Hierdie  wetsontwerp  maak  voorsiening   vir   'n   geÃ¯ntegreerde   en   'n
gekoÃ¶rdineerde   rampbestuursbeleid   wat   fokuseer   op   voorkoming    of
vermindering van die risiko  van  rampe,  verligting  van  die  felheid  van
rampe, noodgereedheid, vinnige en effektiewe reaksie tot  rampe  en  herstel
nÃ¡ rampe.

Voorsiening word gemaak vir die instelling  van  nasionale,  provinsiale  en
munisipale rampbestuursentrums. Een van die belangrikste  funksies  van  die
nasionale rampbestuursentrum is die klassifisering van rampe  as  plaaslike,
provinsiale  of  nasionale  rampe.  'n  Metropolitaanse  voorsitter  of   'n
distriksmunisipaliteit kan 'n eenheid van  vrywilligers  instel  in  daardie
munisipaliteit om aan  rampbestuur  in  die  munisipaliteit  deel  te  neem.
Verpligtend vir elke metropolitaanse  en  distriksmunisipaliteit  is  om  'n
rampbestuursentrum vir hulle gebied in te stel.

Ingevolge  die  wetsontwerp  moet  die  nasionale  rampbestuursraamwerk   'n
raamwerk  voorsien  waarbinne  staatsorgane  rampbestuur  kan  befonds,  met
besondere klem  op  voorkoming  en  vermindering  van  risiko's  van  rampe,
insluitende toekennings om by te dra tot herstel nÃ¡ rampe  en  rehabilitasie
en betaling van slagoffers van rampe en hulle afhanklikes.

Wanneer 'n ramp plaasvind, kan  die  nasionale,  provinsiale  en  munisipale
staatsorgane  finansieel  bydra   tot   reaksie-optredes   en   herstel   en
rehabilitasie nÃ¡ rampe. Die koste verbonde aan  die  herstel  of  vervanging
van  openbaresektorinfrastruktuur   behoort   gedra   te   word   deur   die
staatsorgane wat verantwoordelik is  vir  die  instandhouding  van  sodanige
infrastruktuur.

Die Minister kan, in die nasionale rampbestuursraamwerk, 'n persentasie  van
die  begroting  of  enige  aspek  van  'n  begroting  van  'n  provinsie  of
munisipale staatsorgaan voorskryf as 'n drempel om  toegang  te  verkry  vir
addisionele befondsing deur die  nasionale  regering  vir  reaksie-optredes.
Munisipaliteite met 'n gebrekkige kapasiteit sal gehelp  moet  word  om  die
strukture en planne, soos deur  die  wetsontwerp  voorgeskryf,  in  plek  te
stel. Hier kan veral verwys word na  die  verskillende  rampbestuursentrums,
asook die rampbestuursplanne. Befondsing hiervoor moet  deur  die  nasionale
regering as 'n voorwaardelike toekenning aan munisipaliteite gemaak word.

Rampbestuur, voorkoming en verligting  deur  munisipaliteite  en  provinsies
sal befonds moet word deur die  begroting  van  die  nasionale  departement.
Aansoek sal gedoen moet kan word vir die befondsing  van  bepaalde  projekte
wat  geÃ«valueer  moet   word   teen   die   nasionale   prioriteitslys   van
ramprisiko's. Ernstige oorweging sal dus geskenk moet word aan die  volgende
drie belangrike finansiÃ«le komponente: duidelike kriteria vir provinsies  en
munisipaliteite om befondsing  van  die  sentrale  gebeurlikheidsreserwe  te
bekom; befondsing om die  instelling  van  munisipale  rampbestuursentra  te
vergemaklik,   en   voorsiening   van   befondsing   aan    provinsies    en
munisipaliteite vir voorkoming en verligting.

Aan   die   Minister,   agb   Adjunkminister,   die   voorsitter   van   die
portefeuljekomitee en in besonder die personeel, wil ons baie dankie sÃª.  Ek
dink dit is 'n baie groot verbetering op die wetgewing wat  ons  op  hierdie
oomblik het en die Nuwe NP steun dit baie graag. [Applous.] (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This Bill makes provision  for  an  integrated  and  co-ordinated  disaster
management policy which focuses on preventing or reducing the risk  inherent
in disasters, relieving the severity of  disasters,  ensuring  readiness  to
deal with emergencies, responding quickly and effectively to  disasters  and
reparation after disasters.

Provision is being made for the establishment of  national,  provincial  and
municipal disaster management centres. One of the most  important  functions
of  the  national  disaster  management  centre  is  the  classification  of
disasters  as  local,  provincial  or  national  disasters.  A  metropolitan
chairperson or a district municipality can establish a  unit  of  volunteers
in  that  municipality  to  participate  in  disaster  management  in   that
particular  municipality.  It  is  compulsory  for  every  metropolitan  and
district municipality to establish a disaster management  centre  for  their
area.

In terms of  the  Bill  the  national  disaster  management  framework  must
provide a framework within which state organs can fund disaster  management,
with particular emphasis on the prevention and  reduction  of  the  risk  of
disasters, including allocations  to  contribute  to  the  reparation  after
disasters and rehabilitation and payments to victims of disasters and  their
dependants.

When a disaster occurs national, provincial and municipal  organs  of  state
can  contribute  financially  to  response  activities  and  reparation  and
rehabilitation after disasters. The  costs  related  to  the  reparation  or
replacement of public sector infrastructure  ought  to  be  carried  by  the
state organs responsible for the maintenance of such infrastructure.

The Minister can, in the national disaster management  framework,  prescribe
a percentage of the budget or any aspect of a  budget  of  a  provincial  or
municipal organ of state  as  a  threshold  to  gain  access  to  additional
funding  through  the   national   government   for   response   activities.
Municipalities with insufficient capacity will have to be  assisted  to  put
in place the structures and plans, as prescribed by the Bill. Here  one  can
refer specifically to the different disaster management centres as  well  as
the disaster management plans. Funding  for  this  should  be  made  by  the
national government to municipalities as a conditional allocation.

Disaster management, prevention and relief by municipalities  and  provinces
will have  to  be  funded  from  the  budget  of  the  national  department.
Application will have to be made for the funding of specific projects  which
will have to be assessed against the  national  priority  list  of  disaster
risks. Serious  consideration  will  therefore  have  to  be  given  to  the
following  three  important  financial  components:   clear   criteria   for
provinces and municipalities to get funding  from  the  central  contingency
reserve; funding to  facilitate  the  establishment  of  municipal  disaster
management  centres;  and  the  provision  of  funding  to   provinces   and
municipalities for prevention and relief.
We would like to say thank  you  very  much  to  the  Minister,  hon  Deputy
Minister, the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee and in  particular  the
staff. I think this is a vast improvement on the legislation  that  we  have
at the moment and the New NP gladly takes great pleasure in  supporting  it.
[Applause.]

Rev A D GOOSEN: Chairperson, my contribution to this debate  will  focus  on
the importance of co-operative  governance  in  all  matters  pertaining  to
disaster management. This is significant especially as  disaster  management
can never be the sole responsibility  of  just  one  sphere  of  government,
because when a disaster strikes a certain area or community the  country  as
a whole is affected.

The need, therefore, to rally to the aid of those  who  have  been  directly
affected by a disaster warrants the assistance not only of  all  spheres  of
government, but also of civil society. This then is precisely what the  Bill
provides for.

Chapter 2 of the Bill makes provision for  intergovernmental  structures  to
be put in place. The first condition is that the  President  must  establish
an  Intergovernmental  Committee  on  Disaster  Management,  consisting   of
Cabinet  Ministers,  MECs  and  municipal   councillors.   This   committee,
therefore, consists solely of politicians whose sole  responsibility  is  to
lead the process.

The significance of the committee  is  that  it  must  give  effect  to  the
principles of co-operative governance  as  set  out  in  Chapter  3  of  the
Constitution. I merely want to  mention  section  41,  which  says  in  this
regard that all spheres must ``co-operate with one another in  mutual  trust
and good faith''.

Barring  the  aforementioned,  the  intergovernmental  committee   is   also
accountable and must report to Cabinet  on  the  co-ordination  of  disaster
management among the different spheres of government so that they  will  all
be  brought  into  one  body.  The  committee  must  also  advise  and  make
recommendations to Cabinet on issues relating to  disaster  management,  and
on the establishment of a national framework for disaster management,  which
is aimed  at  ensuring  an  integrated  and  uniform  approach  to  disaster
management by all spheres.

The other structure which is also of importance is  the  one  brought  about
and established by the Minister for Provincial and Local Government,  namely
the National Disaster Management Advisory Forum. This body consists  of  the
head of the national centre. It includes representatives from  the  national
Government and provincial departments, as well as municipal officials and  a
host of role-players, such as organised business and so forth.

This body is, as such, a body of officials. The advisory forum is a body  in
which all the spheres of  government  and  other  role-players  consult  one
another and co-ordinate their actions  on  matters  pertaining  to  disaster
management. Therefore, we can see that the different spheres  of  government
are brought in to play their role in curbing disasters  and  their  effects.
As a body this forum, consisting of officials, makes recommendations to  the
Intergovernmental Committee on Disaster Management.

Apart from the forum, we also  have  what  we  call  the  National  Disaster
Management  Framework  whose  prime  responsibility  is  to  carry  out  the
implementation envisaged in the Disaster Management Bill. Contrary  to  what
Mrs Borman said here, namely that she doubts whether this framework will  be
implemented, it is possible that it is going to be  implemented,  come  what
may. [Interjections.]

The framework is going to  lay  down  the  ground  rules.  It  is  going  to
establish and facilitate a number of things. The most important of these  is
to establish prevention and mitigation as the core  principles  of  disaster
management. Mitigation means to make  the  occurrence  less  severe  and  to
lessen the impact of a disaster, and that will thus be  the  core  principle
of disaster management. This means not just to deal with a disaster when  it
occurs, but rather to prevent it from  occurring  if  that  is  in  any  way
possible.
The framework must  also  provide  a  coherent,  transparent  and  inclusive
policy on disaster management in South Africa. It must not  only  facilitate
international and regional co-operation, but also  the  involvement  of  all
role-players, such as the private sector, the NGOs and so  forth,  and  give
effect to the application of co-operative governance amongst  the  different
spheres of government.

So one can see that this is particularly important because, as in  the  case
of the  Intergovernmental  Committee  on  Disaster  Management  which  gives
effect to the principles of co-operative governance, the  responsibility  of
a framework is that it must therefore guide the process  as  to  how  it  is
done. I just want to say that the framework must also include the  promotion
of research, community  participation  and  the  facilitation  of  capacity-
building, especially in schools - in education.

So  we  can  see  that  everybody  is  going  to  be  involved  in  disaster
management. It is not just a once-off thing, but rather an ongoing  process.
It becomes, as such, a way of life in South Africa. This then  is  precisely
what the Bill is seeking to attain. I therefore have absolutely no doubt  in
my mind that through this Bill we have delivered on what was  expected  from
the portfolio committee, and  that  was  to  produce  a  workable  piece  of
legislation that would be to the benefit of all South Africans.

I want to thank the  department,  especially  Mr  Louis  Buys.  During  past
disasters his name was mentioned as someone who did  sterling  work  in  the
communities. I know that once this Bill has  been  passed,  promulgated  and
implemented, we will see a great change in our country. This Bill could  not
have come at a better time for the DA to manage its  disaster  of  financial
mismanagement in Cape Town. [Applause.]

Mr D G MKONO: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  events  currently
unfolding at the World Heritage Site of St Lucia in KwaZulu-Natal,  and  the
recent extensive and repeated flooding that has occurred in various  regions
of the Eastern Cape,  highlight  the  necessity  for  co-ordinated  disaster
management.

Last year saw the destruction of large numbers  of  livestock  in  the  Free
State owing to severe cold and snow,  and  the  year  before  that  saw  the
outbreak of cholera in KwaZulu-Natal as well as foot-and-mouth  disease.  In
the year preceding this one, there was massive  flooding  in  KwaZulu-Natal,
Mpumalanga and Limpopo,  and  massive  forest  and  veld  fires  across  the
Western Cape and Eastern Cape. In the past three  years  numerous  tornadoes
have struck populated areas, destroying the homes of many people. What  this
list of events demonstrates  is  that,  firstly,  disasters  are  a  regular
occurrence in South Africa and, secondly, that we have faced and can  expect
to continue to face a wide and diverse range of disasters.

Disaster management, and the manipulation of  the  Bill  before  us,  is  an
expensive  affair  that  cannot  be   denied.   What   we   as   responsible
parliamentarians cannot lose sight of is  the  astonishingly  high  cost  in
human life  and  the  socioeconomic  suffering  that  these  disasters  have
caused. When we compare these  costs  with  the  costs  of  proper  disaster
management,  we  cannot  but  come  to  the  conclusion  that   the   proper
implementation of this Bill should be a matter of priority.

Despite the comprehensive nature of this Bill  and  the  framework  that  it
envisages,   the   UDM   must   raise   an   important   concern   regarding
implementation. There have been numerous  unfortunate  instances  in  recent
years in which an  area  was  declared  a  disaster  area,  but  the  proper
responses and relief from authorities were not forthcoming for  many  months
or even years. This type of situation cannot be  tolerated.  If  we  are  to
invest in disaster management and create the large  administration  intended
by this Bill, then  we  cannot  allow  the  continuation  of  the  trend  of
painfully slow disaster relief on the ground. Having said that, we hold  out
much hope that this new Bill will, in fact, improve  the  speed  with  which
authorities respond to disasters.

The strength of this Bill lies in its recognition of all  three  spheres  of
government  and,  specifically,  the  recognition  in  chapter  6   of   the
responsibility of the national sphere of government to  provide  funding  to
assist provincial and local governments to deal with  postdisaster  recovery
and rehabilitation.  Mitigation  and  emergency  preparedness  must  be  the
medium-term goal of national disaster management,  with  specific  attention
focused on the capacity of municipalities to  be  prepared  for  emergencies
and to have the ability to mitigate their severity.

The overall financial and  management  capacity  of  municipalities  remains
problematic, especially in the context of severe  financial  pressure  being
experienced by the vast majority of municipalities. When  it  comes  to  the
highly technical and complicated nature  of  disaster  management,  national
and provincial governments have a clear and unambiguous duty to ensure  that
the sphere of government that is usually closest to the  disaster  area  has
the capacity to respond immediately and effectively.
Finally, I would like to turn to chapter 7 of the Bill which deals with  the
issue of disaster management volunteers. These provisions are  long  overdue
and will  hopefully  provide  the  framework  for  the  many  dedicated  and
committed citizens, who have volunteered during disasters,  to  receive  the
training that will enhance their abilities to contribute constructively.

It is a matter of great pride that South Africans have  never  hesitated  to
volunteer for anything, from forest firefighting  to  cleaning  oil-drenched
penguins, whenever disaster has struck.  There  are  clearly  a  great  many
South Africans who see it as their duty as citizens to be actively  involved
in disaster management. I  believe  that  this  House  should  salute  these
dedicated South Africans through the proper implementation of this  chapter.
The UDM supports the Bill. [Time expired.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Chairperson and hon Minister, we cannot avoid  disasters,
but we can  make  provision  through  policies  and  funding  for  emergency
preparedness, prevention, mitigation, emergency  response  and  postdisaster
recovery.

Every year we have major  floods  in  our  country.  The  Eastern  Cape  has
recently experienced one of its worst winters in a long  time.  People  were
trapped  by  snow,   and   the   ensuing   floods   damaged   property   and
infrastructure. The human despair that comes with such environmental  damage
is not measured by proper state compensation. Losses  incurred  involve  not
only the destruction of property, but also the new burden of  the  costs  on
families to fix damaged property.

The worst disasters seem to occur the worst in poor areas.  This  is  mainly
because poor people cannot make provision for insurance  policies,  nor  can
poor  areas  expect  reasonable  maintenance   of   the   environment   from
government, especially  from  local  and  municipal  governments.  In  other
words, in poor areas basic environmental management must, primarily, be  the
responsibility of all government spheres.

In response to the disaster  that  occurred  on  the  Cape  Flats  in  2001,
Ministers from  national,  provincial  and  local  government  promised  the
residents that land had been identified to which they could be relocated  as
the land they were  currently  occupying  was  not  conducive  to  safe  and
healthy conditions. But there are obviously no services in  that  community.
To date, this has not happened. It would dramatically affect the votes of  a
particular political party if many residents from that ward  were  moved  to
another ward. It is a disgrace when people become  pawns  in  the  hands  of
political bosses for political expediency.

The Bill makes provision for  an  intergovernmental  committee  on  disaster
management, a four-tier governmental co-operative body which, we hope,  will
address some of this country's most serious basic human needs.  All  spheres
of government should have equal access to the contingency reserve fund,  and
it should not be viewed as the national  fund  only.  Guidelines  should  be
drawn up so that emergency  access  does  not  hamper  rapid  and  effective
response to disasters.
Disaster management touches the core of human development and  security.  In
our country, prevention and mitigation cannot  be  seen  in  isolation  from
basic infrastructural security. What this Bill does not  adequately  address
is the poor environmental and living infrastructure in  which  most  of  our
people live. The obligation to manage these areas falls  mainly  within  the
competence of local and municipal authorities. Many municipalities  have  no
or limited capacity  to  deal  with  disasters.  National  government  must,
through start-up costs and ongoing institutional costs, budget for and  fund
these municipalities to prepare them for any disaster.

However, whatever alleviation is provided,  we  cannot  ignore  the  problem
that  infrastructural  weaknesses  persist   in   these   communities.   The
mitigating measures local and  municipal  governments  need  to  provide  to
qualify for state disaster grants are no  match  for  addressing  the  basic
living and unsustainable environmental conditions these communities face.

Many informal settlements are designed for disasters to  happen.  Local  and
municipal  governments  are  unable  to  do  anything  about   this.   Their
preventive measures will  only  be  patchwork  instead  of  real  management
control. Funding  of  postdisaster  recovery  and  rehabilitation  would  be
difficult to apply in this regard.  In  other  words,  to  be  able  to  get
Government  assistance,  municipalities  will  have  to  ensure   that   all
infrastructure and policy demand certain requirements.

What we need is a more comprehensive  policy  that  includes  infrastructure
development that is attached  to  disaster  management  control.  Local  and
municipal governments that meet the requirements through the development  of
infrastructure  must  be  compensated  accordingly  in   relation   to   any
mitigating measures subscribed to in this regard.

The Bill  makes  provision  for  the  development  of  a  national  disaster
management framework. We  in  the  ACDP  believe  that  this  framework  can
provide  the  principles  and  details  of  infrastructure  development  and
disaster control management. It is, therefore, imperative that the  national
management centre ensures that all spheres of  government  and  other  role-
players establish, co-ordinate, promote and  implement  disaster  management
in all their plans and strategies.

In order to manage disasters  effectively,  governments,  according  to  the
Financial and Fiscal Commission, are required to plan  ahead,  build  better
and move people out of harm's way. In order to do this, we believe that  the
proper basic socioeconomic and environmental needs must  be  met.  The  ACDP
supports the Bill.

Mr B J NOBUNGA: Chairperson, hon members,  disaster  management  is  a  very
important  issue  that  governments  must  deal  with,  especially  in  this
millennium.

Development benefits  mankind  whilst,  at  the  same  time,  disadvantaging
mankind and the environment. The change in  global  weather  patterns  is  a
case in point, which shows how the price  of  development  has  been  global
warming from  the  emissions  of  our  industries  and  automobiles.  Recent
weather patterns have seen many countries affected by tornadoes, floods  and
earthquakes, and we can never tell the extent to which our  activities  have
contributed to some of these occurrences. But, with regard to  others,  like
tornadoes and floods, we can,  with  conviction,  argue  the  positive  link
between these occurrences.

In South Africa in the past we saw the issue of disasters as something  that
did not touch us that much, in particular snow.  But  the  recent  disasters
precipitated by global warming have shown us  that  we  would  be  making  a
mistake to think that we are immune  to  disasters.  The  recent  very  cold
weather in the Eastern Cape, the floods in the Western Cape  and  the  fires
in Mpumalanga and other disasters  that  occurred  in  other  parts  of  our
country show that we are also victims of disasters.

We need to be always on the alert to act when challenged by nature  or  even
human-made or human-error disasters, such as the  train  accidents  we  have
seen in Mozambique, Tanzania and India. Local government faces even  greater
challenges in this regard. They are the first port  of  call  when  disaster
strikes. The Bill  requires  metropolitan  and  district  municipalities  to
establish and  implement  a  framework  for  disaster  management  aimed  at
ensuring  an  integrated  and  uniform  approach,  which  will  ensure   the
involvement of both the private sector and nongovernmental institutions.

These are great challenges, considering that some  of  these  municipalities
do not have the capacity to deal with such issues without assistance.  There
is also the fact that  some  category  C  municipalities  do  not  have  the
capacity to handle some of the functions stipulated in  this  Bill,  whilst,
on the other hand, some category B municipalities  have  the  capacity,  and
these municipalities are going to perform these functions on behalf  of  the
category C municipalities.

The greatest challenge is  that,  in  these  instances,  the  municipalities
without capacity are those municipalities  in  needy  areas  and  previously
disadvantaged communities. We have seen during  the  recent  disasters  that
befell the Eastern Cape that the majority of the people that are  the  worst
affected are not even able to pick up the pieces in order to start all  over
again. Poverty and helplessness are thus perpetuated.

This is where one would expect local government  to  assist,  but  they  are
experiencing  fundamental  problems,  such  as   capacity   and   resources.
Rehabilitation of disaster-affected  areas  cancels  out  the  strides  this
Government has made to improve access, and impoverishes our people again.

The Bill expects that different district municipalities  should  co-ordinate
the efforts at disaster management in municipal disaster management  centres
in order for them to be able  to  promote  an  integrated  and  co-ordinated
approach to disaster management, with special  emphasis  on  prevention  and
mitigation. The municipal disaster management centre  is  thus  supposed  to
have a disaster management plan, which will require capacity on the part  of
municipalities to draw up monitor and execute.

For disaster management to be  successful,  a  co-ordinated  and  integrated
approach, which seeks to pool all resources,  will  be  necessary,  as  will
adopting an approach which says that for there to be  maximum  participation
and utilisation of human resources one needs to  directly  involve  as  many
stakeholders as possible. The idea of  the  municipal  advisory  forum  then
becomes a need that cannot be compromised. Although the  provision  in  this
Bill makes it mandatory, we feel the forum  will  contribute  a  great  deal
towards the success of disaster management, especially at municipal level.

The forum, therefore, poses a  challenge  to  the  municipal  capacity  that
would help it, within its jurisdiction where the centre is, to lead or  work
with the forum which will have specialists or people whose work  impacts  on
disaster  vis-Ã -vis  management,  business,  labour,  civic   organisations,
traditional leaders and other stakeholders.

Resources are always needed when disaster strikes, but  resources  are  also
needed to ensure that communities are more prepared  in  order  to  minimise
the aftereffects of disasters. With the state of  underdevelopment  in  most
communities, the congestion of informal settlements, the poor  planning  and
storm water drainage in areas where the  previously  disadvantaged  are  and
where  poorest  in  our  communities  are,  coupled  with  the  poverty  and
unemployment which make the rate of indigence very high, the greater  amount
of resources are therefore needed to help these  communities  to  cope  with
the challenge of meeting the requirements of this legislation.

The successful implementation of this Bill will be supported by  a  start-up
backing fund, which will ensure that the necessary  structures  are  put  in
place  and  that  the  initial  processes  that   make   it   possible   for
municipalities to ready themselves for any eventuality that may occur  as  a
result of a disaster or disasters kick in.

Angivale ngekutsi ngihlabe umkhosi kuto tonkhe  takha  muti  talelive  kanye
nemhlaba wonkhe kwekutsi sikwente kube ngumsebenti wetfu  kunciphisa  tonkhe

[I want to conclude by raising the alarm among  all  the  citizens  of  this
country and the whole world that we should make  it  our  responsibility  to
minimise everything that causes the weather pattern to change ...]

... more especially this week when we pass this Bill and also owing  to  the
fact that this week has been declared as ``Ozone and Atmosphere Week''.

We are therefore calling on the people of South  Africa  to  volunteer  when
this legislation has been promulgated in order to be  ready  to  help  other
South Africans who would be affected by any kind of  disaster  that  befalls
us in this country, including our neighbours, and people in other  parts  of
the world. The ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]
Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairman, the Disaster Management Bill is a timely and  very
necessary piece of legislation. It is a plan which puts  our  country  in  a
state of preparedness for any disaster, especially those caused by nature.

Scientists have warned of global warming and  radical  changes  in  climatic
conditions. It has been observed that some parts of the world which used  to
be extremely cold are experiencing heat, while those  countries  which  used
to be warm are experiencing unprecedented  cold.  The  changes  in  our  own
country have caused floods, strong winds and  heavy  snow,  resulting  in  a
great deal of damage to livestock and plants, and the loss  of  human  life.
There have also been destructive fires.

The Bill provides for an integrated  and  co-ordinated  disaster  management
policy that focuses  on  preventing  or  reducing  the  risk  of  disasters,
mitigating the severity of  disasters,  emergency  preparedness,  rapid  and
effective  response  to  disasters  and  postdisaster  recovery.  The   Bill
provides for national, provincial and municipal disaster management  centres
and  disaster  management  volunteers.  Clauses  26   and   27   deal   with
responsibilities in the event of a national disaster and the declaration  of
a national state of disaster, respectively.

Clause 27  is  a  great  improvement  on  the  state  of  affairs  that  has
prevailed. In the past, pleas had to be made for an area to  be  declared  a
national disaster area, but now clause 27(1) states:


  In the event of a national disaster, the Minister may, by notice  in  the
  Gazette, declare a national state of disaster if -


  (a) existing legislation and contingency arrangements do  not  adequately
       provide for the national  executive  to  deal  effectively  with  the
       disaster; or


  (b) other special circumstances warrant the  declaration  of  a  national
       state of disaster.

The PAC thinks that this is a prudent piece of legislation and  that  it  is
well thought out. We hope that this Bill will not be a case  of  legislation
only being good on paper, but failing on implementation.  The  PAC  supports
the Disaster Management Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson and Minister, over the past year we  have  seen
the world hit by a series of  disasters,  such  as  famines,  floods,  heavy
rains and earthquakes, among many  other  natural  and  man-made  disasters.
Government's duty in terms of this is to put in  place  management  criteria
to approach such horrific situations.

The MF is pleased to note that this Bill does not only set  out  to  do  the
above, but also aims to put in place important measures in  order  to  avoid
and minimise the possibility of this human and economic loss. The MF  is  in
full support of all sectors - public, private and NGOs  -  dedicating  their
efforts to preventing these losses.

We are once again called upon to work together, and  this  will  be  to  the
benefit of all people, no  matter  what  sector  they  belong  to.  Disaster
management is for all. It is not an arena for political  parties  to  engage
in a competition for votes in the  next  election.  We  should  utilise  the
competition positively by challenging each other as to how much  we  can  do
to establish a proper and adequate disaster management system.  Let  us  not
waste time in finger pointing as to who has and who has not  done  whatever.
We are here to protect our people, and let us assure our people that we  are
here to do that.

The Disaster Management Bill has been debated at length and that  is  to  be
expected, noting the intricacy of putting such a mechanism in place. The  MF
would like to give  notice  of  its  full  support  and  dedication  to  the
disaster management project, and hereby calls on all parties and persons  to
embrace this project and make every effort to put  their  shoulders  to  the
wheel to put it into effect.

The MF supports the Disaster Management Bill. [Applause.]

Mr G A J GROBLER: Chairperson, the Bill that we are debating  today  is  one
of those Bills that are absolutely necessary.

Provision must be made at all three levels of government for  structures  to
provide for the following: preventing or reducing  the  risk  of  disasters,
mitigating the severity of  disasters,  emergency  preparedness,  rapid  and
effective response to disasters, postdisaster recovery, etc.

To manage all these issues,  national,  provincial  and  municipal  disaster
management centres  must  be  put  in  place.  Of  course,  one  hopes  that
disasters will never  happen.  Provincial  and  local  authorities  annually
budget for and spend millions of rands on protection and ambulance  services
in the hope that  they  will  not  have  to  make  use  of  these  services.
Unfortunately, life does not work that way.

We in our country are blessed. So far we have been spared  the  disaster  of
11 September that Americans experienced because of  the  deplorable  actions
of terrorists. South Africa, on the other hand, is regularly hit by  natural
disasters, such as  floods  and  veld  fires,  as  recently  experienced  in
various parts of our country. The  pollution  disaster  which  is  currently
looming on our coastlines is becoming a  regular  feature,  and  that  is  a
worrying aspect. However,  we  are  blessed  with  persons  who  are  always
prepared to put their lives at risk in order to save the lives and  property
of other people. The DA wants to pay tribute to these people.

What  is,  however,  a  matter  of  concern  is  the  inability  of  certain
provincial governments and municipalities  to  learn  from  experience.  Not
enough attention is given to  the  prevention  of  disasters,  such  as  the
flooding of low-lying areas - and we have heard today that it is mostly  the
poor who suffer. Millions of rands are readily available for  some  premiers
to create little empires. These moneys - the  R25  million  in  the  Western
Cape, for instance - could have been better spent  on  preventing  disasters
that so regularly occur in the Western Cape.

During the deliberation stages  of  this  Bill  many  valuable  inputs  were
received from various stakeholders. No Bill can be seen as a  perfect  Bill,
but with the assistance of the personnel of  various  departments,  who  are
sitting on this side here, the portfolio committee was  able  to  produce  a
Bill that can be of great value in managing disasters in this country.

The cost factors in these cases are of no importance, because the life of  a
person cannot be measured  in  rands  and  cents.  What  is  of  importance,
especially as far as local government  is  concerned,  is  that  funds  must
follow functions.

The DA supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr Y I CARRIM: Chairperson, comrades and friends, ultimately there are  five
features of the new model of disaster management:  firstly,  prevention  and
mitigation  are  at  its  heart;  secondly,  it  is   the   poor   who   are
disproportionately vulnerable to disasters; thirdly, disaster management  is
integral  to  the  development  plans  of   all   spheres   of   government,
particularly local government; fourthly, the concerted co-operation  of  all
three spheres of government is crucial to managing disasters as part  of  an
integrated, co-ordinated and uniform approach; and, fifthly, the active  co-
operation and involvement  of  civil  society  is  fundamental  to  managing
disasters effectively.

The  new  model,  as  has  been  indicated  already  by  several   speakers,
represents a very comprehensive approach to disaster  management.  It  is  a
considerable advance on the old model used in this country. The  predominant
focus, of course, of the old model was on relief and recovery  efforts,  but
the new model focuses fundamentally on preventive measures.

I would like  to  quote  the  definitions  of  ``disaster''  and  ``disaster
management''  to  convey  to  members  the  quality  of  this  Bill  and  to
acknowledge the enormous contribution of the department. They read thus:


  ``disaster'' means a progressive  or  sudden,  widespread  or  localised,
  natural or human-caused occurrence which -


  (a) causes or threatens to cause -


       (i)  death, injury or disease;
       (ii) damage to property, infrastructure or the environment; or
       (iii)      disruption of the life of a community; and


  (b) is of a magnitude that exceeds the ability of those affected  by  the
       disaster to cope with its effects using only their own resources;


     ``disaster  management''  means  a  continuous  and  integrated  multi-
     sectoral, multi-disciplinary process of planning and implementation  of
     measures aimed at -


     (a)    preventing or reducing the risk of disasters;
     (b)    mitigating the severity or consequences of disasters;
     (c)    emergency preparedness;
     (d)    a rapid and effective response to disasters; and
     (e)    post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation.

There can surely be very few countries in the  world  that  have  such  good
definitions of both ``disaster'' and ``disaster management''.  I  hope  that
this will serve as a guide, not just to other countries  in  the  developing
world, but to those in the advanced and industrialised world too.

Aspects of the new model, of course, have already begun  to  be  implemented
and have served us well in managing disasters in the recent  past.  But,  of
course, there is a long way to go before the model set out in  the  Bill  is
fully implemented. It is crucial, therefore, that  an  appropriate  strategy
for its  implementation  is  developed.  That  must  involve  not  just  the
department, but a wide range of other stakeholders as well.  A  key  aspect,
of  course,  is  funding  for  both  implementing  the  model  and  managing
disasters.

The portfolio committee feels that the contention that  disaster  management
is not an original  competence  of  local  government,  as  defined  in  the
Constitution, is reasonable. The argument  that  disaster  management  is  a
concurrent function of national and  provincial  government,  and  that  the
Bill,  in  effect,  assigns  additional  powers  and  functions   to   local
government, is entirely reasonable. Hence, the portfolio committee  proposed
that in terms of the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Systems  Act  the  Bill
should be referred to the Financial and Fiscal Commission for it  to  assess
the cost of the Bill if it is to be implemented.

The  FFC  provided  a  fairly  comprehensive   report   on   the   financial
implications of the Bill. We express  our  appreciation  for  that.  We  are
pleased to note too that the Ministry and the department  are  committed  to
giving  serious  attention  to  these  proposals.  We  will,  obviously,  be
monitoring developments.

The portfolio  committee  would  like  to  emphasise  its  concern  in  that
national and  provincial  governments  must  avoid  heaping  more  and  more
responsibilities on local government without ensuring that local  government
has  the  necessary  funds  and  capacity  to  implement  these   additional
responsibilities. We are pleased to note, too, that  the  Municipal  Finance
Management Bill  currently  before  Parliament,  in  fact,  strengthens  the
provisions in the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act  against  unfunded
mandates.

In our report to Parliament, we summarised the proposals of the FFC  on  the
funding of disaster management. As a committee we do not have the  technical
expertise to evaluate the practicability of these  proposals,  but  we  feel
that serious consideration should be given to the following:  firstly,  that
the three existing relief funds -  the  Disaster  Relief  Fund,  the  Social
Relief Fund and  the  State  President's  Fund  -  should  be  combined  and
administered  centrally;  secondly,  that   clear   principles   should   be
determined for provincial governments and municipalities to  access  funding
from the central contingency reserve; thirdly, the possibility of  providing
funding to facilitate the establishment  of  municipal  disaster  management
centres and to provide an incentive for municipalities to  get  involved  in
disaster management; and, fourthly, the possibility of providing funding  to
provinces and municipalities for prevention and mitigation.

The committee notes too that with the passing  of  the  Disaster  Management
Bill, disasters will be declared twice: in terms of the Disaster  Management
Bill and the Fundraising Act of 1978. The committee urges the  executive  to
consider resolving this anomaly.

The committee also urges the executive to expedite the  setting  up  of  the
National Disaster Management Centre with the requisite start-up funding  and
funding also  for  responding  to  disasters  and  the  appointment  of  the
centre's head so that a national disaster management framework is  in  place
as soon as  possible.  It  is  also  important  that  regulations  that  are
necessary  to  support  the  successful  implementation  of   the   Disaster
Management Bill, should be in place before the Act is put into operation.

As I move towards a conclusion, I want to observe that Mrs Gloria Borman  of
the disaster alliance -  for  really  that  is  what  it  is  -  is  totally
incapable of being positive about anything regarding this new  democracy  or
this Government. [Interjections.] I challenge members to  look  at  Hansard.
From June 1999 onwards there has never been a single occasion on  which  Mrs
Borman has said anything remotely positive either about this new  Government
or this new democracy. [Interjections.]

In fact, I thought that  for  once,  instead  of  the  usual  shrieking  and
screeching, we would hear something constructive, conciliatory and  positive
because this is a noncontentious Bill. [Interjections.] It is  a  Bill  that
was secured through considerable consensus in the committee. I think  it  is
really  sad  that   Mrs   Borman   is   incapable   of   escaping   herself.
[Interjections.] The more she screeches negatively, the  less  seriously  we
take anything she says. [Interjections.]

In fact, a very senior member of this House, as I came to the  podium,  said
to me: ``Is there nothing, Yunus, you can do  about  saying  to  this  House
that we need some sort of management of Gloria  Borman's  disastrous  inputs
in this House? Is there no way  that  we  can  do  that?''  [Interjections.]
[Applause.] I said to him that it was not for nothing that they are the  DA.
[Interjections.]

Finally, let me go to  something  more  constructive.  [Interjections.]  The
screeching is like water off a duck's back. My appreciation, which  in  fact
has been conveyed many times over, goes to Mr Louis Buys, in  particular.  I
do not want to  suggest  that  there  is  a  Louis  Buys  fan  club  in  our
committee, but it borders on that because of his outstanding work.

I would also like to express my appreciation to Petra  Bouwer,  once  again,
for his sterling work in negotiating the very amendments  we  made  to  this
Bill; to Prof Ailsa Holloway of  the  Disaster  Mitigation  for  Sustainable
Livelihood Project of the University of Cape Town; to  Chris  Sibanyoni;  to
Debhi Hene, if she is around - we  lose  her  to  the  Chief  Whip  of  this
Parliament, but we want to convey, once again, our appreciation to  her;  to
Pat Reid, who, I think, has just foregone her  presidency  of  the  Disaster
Management Institute of Southern Africa; and to Allan Sharp  -  an  academic
who engaged us with a document that ran, I think, into 40 or  so  pages,  as
our very erstwhile secretary of our committee would say.

This is, in fact, a very good Bill. It has  the  full  support  of  all  the
political parties, notwithstanding Mrs Gloria Bosman and her shrieking,  and
a wide range of stakeholders. [Interjections.] It is time now for all of  us
to work together to effectively implement the new Bill. [Interjections.]

In conclusion, I want to address, in particular, a colleague  of  mine,  Rob
Davies, by drawing his attention to the fact that  I  have  not  used  three
minutes and 10 seconds of my time. [Interjections.] Now, I know this may  be
a surprise, not least to the Chairperson of this House and  those  who  know
me, but I would like a full round of applause for the fact that I  am  about
to end my speech three minutes short of the  10  minutes  allocated  to  me.
[Applause.]

Thank you very much. And, I would finally like to draw the attention of  the
current presiding officer to the fact that I am  owed  two  minutes  and  48
seconds the next time I speak here,  over  and  above  the  time  allocated.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson,  I
have just overheard the chairperson of the portfolio committee say  that  he
forgot to welcome our new director-general. Members  will  notice  that  our
new director-general is a woman, Ms  Lindiwe  Msengana-Ndlela.  Hon  members
had better get to know her better in the future. She is the lady in the  red
jacket over there. Could hon members please give her a  round  of  applause.
[Applause.]

I would like to  thank  everybody  who  participated  in  this  debate,  and
particularly all the political parties that actually  supported  this  Bill,
despite all the things that my favourite MP, Mrs  Gloria  Borman,  has  said
today. I would  like  us  to  ignore  some  of  the  things  she  has  said.
[Interjections.]

Some  of  the  speakers  expressed  scepticism   regarding   implementation.
However, the hon Goosen made a very important point on the  co-operation  of
all three spheres of government when  disasters  occur.  In  addition,  this
Bill provides for  the  establishment  of  a  national  disaster  management
advisory forum and  for  volunteers.  This  means  that  everybody  will  be
involved in the implementation of this legislation.

The hon Mkono is correct: Our people have always volunteered to assist  when
disasters occur, and we salute them. We really  thank  all  our  people  who
have assisted during disasters in the past. We have  to  encourage  them  to
undergo training, as the Bill provides for that  kind  of  capacity-building
so that they are better able to cope with these situations. Our people  have
to be educated around these issues.

The hon Smith raised the issue of unfunded mandates, but  I  would  like  to
emphasise the point that the issue is around proper management of  available
resources and not so much about unfunded  mandates.  The  hon  Southgate  is
also correct. All three spheres of government need to co-operate  with  each
other. She is actually challenging the unicity of Cape Town -  she  did  not
mention it - and the DP to  co-operate  with  the  national  and  provincial
government in the spirit of this legislation in order to ensure  that  those
people who were affected last year by the floods in some parts of  the  Cape
Flats are actually relocated to the areas that we have identified.  We  hope
that the DP will actually assist us in getting  those  people  relocated  to
that land.

I want to thank, once more, the portfolio committee for  the  sterling  work
they have done, as well as the department. I know that they have  more  work
to do as they also sometimes work beyond the borders  of  South  Africa.  We
commend them for the sterling they have done. Could members please give  our
department a round of applause. [Applause.]

I just want to give my friend, the  hon  Borman,  this  bit  of  information
which is that we have been commended as South Africa by the United  Nations,
which said that we did so well with security  around  the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development that they have actually learnt a  lot  from  us  and
have reviewed their own security around the United Nations. I can  tell  the
hon member that we  are  on  the  right  track,  and  are  not  heading  for
disaster. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 18:49.
