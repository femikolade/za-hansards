                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, I shall move  at  the  next  sitting  of  the
House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that six days have passed since it was revealed that, in  1997,
       Mr Jürgen Harksen donated R100 000 to the ANC and R100 000 to the New
       NP, and that they may have received much more than that;


  (2) further notes that the DA has opened its books to  a  forensic  audit
       and promised that, if it is established that the party received money
       from Mr Harksen, it will repay every cent;


  (3) records its disappointment that neither the ANC, nor the New  NP  has
       undertaken to allow a forensic audit of its donations; and


  (4) therefore resolves that the ANC and the New NP  should  undertake  to
       refund all the money they received from Mr Harksen or else explain to
       the public why they refuse to do so.

[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order!

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I shall  move  at  the  next  sitting  of  the
House:


  That the Council-


  (1) notes the continued crisis  of  leadership  in  the  Doomed  to  Fail
       Alliance as a result of the revelation in the Desai Commission;


  (2) further notes the delaying tactics by Mr Gerald Morkel  in  accepting
       that Tony Leon's party, from its formation, was doomed to fail;


  (3) further notes that even though Tony  Leon's  party  proclaims  to  be
       champions of clean government, it continues to blame the ANC and  the
       Desai Commission for the exposure of its corrupt elements; and


  (4) calls upon the leaders of the DA, that is Mr  Tony  Leon  and  Gerald
       Morkel - since they have been proven to be ineffective for leadership
       - to do the honourable thing and resign.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I shall move at the next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that Pietermaritzburg had been decided upon as the  capital  of
       the province of KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) further notes that this  decision  was  arrived  at  in  terms  of  a
       transparent and democratic process in the provincial legislature;


  (3) believes that the decision in the legislature represents the voice of
       the people of the province, and that as such it should be  respected;
       and


  (4) calls on all parties to abide by the majority decision  and  to  work
       towards realising the true potential of our province.

                           DEATH OF HANSIE CRONJÉ

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with sadness -


       (a)  that our nation is mourning; and


       (b)  the tragic  death  of  Hansie  Cronjé,  one  of  our  Republic's
           greatest  sporting  icons,  in  a  flying  accident  during  the
           weekend, has left our nation stunned and devastated;


  (2) is of the opinion that, although he was  a  fallen  hero  as  he  was
       embroiled some two years ago in  match-fixing  scandals  with  Indian
       bookmakers, no-one can deny that he was one of South Africa's  finest
       cricket captains, dedicated, disciplined and devoted, who brought  us
       joy and pride, throughout the cricket stadiums of the world, whenever
       he  led  the  Proteas  to  many  victories  -  he  was  the  ultimate
       professional;


  (3) joins the Cronjé family and friends in sharing the grief  and  sorrow
       in this tragic loss;


  (4) is of the view that the death of Hansie Cronjé has all the  trappings
       of a Greek tragedy; and


  (5) is reminded of the final words of Sydney Carton in Charles Dickens' A
       Tale of Two Cities before being led to the gallows to be executed  by
       the guillotine:


         It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever  done.  It
         is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.

Hamba Kahle, Hansie! [Applause.]

               CENTENNIAL COMMEMORATION OF THE ANGLO-BOER WAR

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  dat die 100-jarige herdenking van die Anglo-Boere-oorlog verlede
           Saterdag in Bloemfontein afgesluit is;


       (b)  van sekere  ooreenkomste  tussen  hierdie  vryheidstryd  en  die
           vryheidstryd wat gelei het tot die  demokrasie  wat  Suid-Afrika
           nou  beleef   aangesien   die   volgende   vrae   beide   groepe
           gekonfronteer het:


           (i)    Watter  prys  was   hulle   bereid   om   vir   politieke
                  onafhanklikheid te betaal?


           (ii)  Wanneer moet vanaf  oorlog  tot  onderhandeling  oorgegaan
                  word?


           (iii) Hoe moet daar ná die nederlaag of  oorwinning  voortgegaan
                  word om 'n nasie te bou?


       (c)  dat die Afrikaners in 1902 hulle taal as  gereedskapstuk  gesien
           het om weer volk te  word  en  dat  hierdie  suksesresep  vandag
           steeds van toepassing is op Afrikaanssprekendes, maar ook op die
           sprekers van al die ander inheemse tale; en
  (2) hom beywer vir die handhawing en uitbou van dié tale soos  vervat  in
       die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the centennial commemoration of the Anglo-Boer War ended in
           Bloemfontein last Saturday;


       (b)  certain similarities  between  this  freedom  struggle  and  the
           freedom struggle which led to  the  democracy  South  Africa  is
           experiencing, as the following questions confronted both groups:


           (i)    What  price  were  they  willing  to  pay  for  political
                  independence?


           (ii)  When must one move from war to negotiation?


           (iii) How must one proceed to build a nation after the defeat or
                  victory?


       (c)  that  in  1902  the  Afrikaners  viewed  their  language  as  an
           instrument to become a nation once again and  that  this  recipe
           for success is still applicable to Afrikaans speakers today, but
           also to the speakers of all the other indigenous languages; and


  (2) strives for the maintenance and  expansion  of  these  languages,  as
       contained in the South African Constitution.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the top quality award, based upon the number of motor  vehicles
       exported to the USA, made by JD Power of  the  United  States  -  the
       global marketing information services firm - to BMW South Africa;


  (2) further notes that -

       African exporters can make it in the global economy.

                        TRAIN DISASTER IN MOZAMBIQUE

                                 (Statement)
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, on 25 May this  year,  at  Tenga
in Maputo province in the southern part of Mozambique, we witnessed  a  very
great tragedy in which more than 100 people lost their lives and  more  than
300 people were injured. This, as we all know, was the  result  of  a  train
disaster that took place in Maputo.

This Council is aware of the enormous difficulties  that  Mozambique  faces,
particularly in the aftermath of the flood disaster that they  suffered  and
we share their grief. We empathise with the kith and kin of those  who  lost
their lives and wish those who are injured well.

This Council would also like to note, with great pride and  joy,  the  swift
response of the South African Government in expressing solidarity  with  the
people of Mozambique by  providing  whatever  support  was  necessary,  both
technically  and  in  terms  of  the  health  services  required.  It   also
recognises the role of provincial and local government and  the  departments
of health in providing whatever  support  was  necessary  and  requested  by
Mozambique.

This Council also notes with pride the role of NGOs and private citizens  of
this country in alleviating the plight of the people in Mozambique.

To this end we find it appropriate to make a statement  to  such  effect  in
this House to express the  support  of  this  Council  for  the  efforts  of
Government,  NGOs  and  private  citizens  in  assisting   the   people   in
Mozambique.

I have prepared, as Chief Whip of  the  National  Council  of  Provinces,  a
statement which I would like to submit after  the  other  political  parties
have made their statements.

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, we in the New NP associate ourselves  with  the
remarks made by the hon Chief Whip. It was with shock that we learnt of  the
terrible train crash in southern Mozambique. We also  extend  our  heartfelt
condolences to the government and people of Mozambique, and to the  families
and colleagues of those who lost their lives in this tragic accident and  we
wish the injured a speedy recovery.

I also noted in the media yesterday  that  a  Mozambique-registered  fishing
boat has gone missing. Four of the fishermen have been recovered and  search
and rescue operations were still under way yesterday. We also  wish  to  say
that we hope that the rescue operations in that incident are successful  and
that the missing fishermen can be found.

We also wish to thank the our Government and say that we fully support  them
in rendering the support and assistance as requested to the  government  and
the people of Mozambique.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson,  we  in  the  IFP,  like  all  other  parties
express,  our  heartfelt  sympathy  on  the  miserable   death   and   agony
experienced by all people who are directly and indirectly involved with  the
train disaster in Mozambique. We are with them  in  their  misery  and  wish
them strength and  a  quick  recovery  from  their  emotional  distress  and
depression as a result of this tragedy. The country as a  whole  is  greatly
affected, and we are with them in this disaster.

Lena ngenye yezinhlekelele  nesibhicongo  esingeke  silibaleke  izizukulwane
ngezizukulwane.  Sengathi  uMdali,  uMninimandla  wonke,  angababopha  futhi
abaphe  amandla  ukuze  bakwazi  ukulala  ngenxeba.  [This  is  one  of  the
disasters that we will never forget, from generation to generation. We  wish
that God Almighty would console them so that they would  be  able  to  brave
the situation.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, the UDM wishes to express  its  condolences  to
the relatives of those who died in the train accident which occurred  on  25
May 2002 in Mozambique. We also wish a speedy recovery to  those  who  still
lie in hospital battling for their lives. We commend the  hon  the  Minister
of Transport, Dullah Omar, for his timeous presence in  Mozambique  for  the
purpose of pledging South Africa's solidarity with citizens of Mozambique.
South Africa has always demonstrated good  neighbourliness.  Mozambique  has
requested to be assisted with  basic  medical  supplies  such  as  bandages,
spirits and ointments. We hope that our country will readily accede to  this
request. Incidents of this nature justify the  need  for  the  existence  of
SADC.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon members,  on  behalf  of
the UCDP, I wish to extend our deepest sympathy to  our  Mozambican  friends
and neighbours on the occasion of the death  and  injury  of  their  beloved
people in a train accident.

This tragedy is even more pathetic and heartbreaking when one  recalls  that
these Mozambican people lost  their  beloved  President  Machel  in  an  air
disaster. Then came the devastating floods of 2000.  And  today  comes  this
catastrophic train disaster. This country has been  consistently  dogged  by
one misfortune after the other. From a Christian perspective, they  need  to
pray to the Almighty God to heal their country and  recommit  themselves  to
Him.
However,  from  a  cultural  point  of  view,  they  may  need  to  make   a
propitiation feast to their gods. Notwithstanding what I have just  said,  I
hope they will be comforted by the knowledge that  we  are  concerned  about
them and wish them well.

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, being charitable to a neighbour is  a  good  and
noble thing. To the extent that our concerns and Government actions  reflect
that concern, we should be supportive and proud in this  House.  It  is  not
only right, but wise and a  long-term  investment  in  the  future.  We  are
therefore pleased that our Government responded positively  to  the  request
for assistance by the Mozambican government in May.

Clearly, the accident has also raised questions as to the condition  of  the
rolling stock and the competence of railway personnel  in  Mozambique.  Here
too, there may be room for us to  help,  train  and  assist.  Perhaps  other
donors, which South Africa is currently  co-ordinating,  can  help  pay  for
such training of Mozambicans in South Africa so that South Africa  does  not
have to spread its own resources and capacity too thin.

The crash left over 100 people  dead  and  over  300  wounded.  Our  hearts,
thoughts and prayers go out to those who have  been  affected  and  hurt  by
this awful accident, particularly to the bereaved families. We  support  the
motion.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I must apologise for the absence of  my  Whip,  Mr
Lever, and in his absence I take this opportunity on behalf of my  party  to
identify with the sentiments expressed by the Chief Whip with regard to  the
tragedy that has befallen Mozambique and its citizens.

Any tragedy anywhere, especially when the most vulnerable are  affected,  is
an occasion of profound sadness. We wish  to  support  the  efforts  of  our
Government to assist regarding those who  died  and  especially  in  helping
those who were injured. We wish them a speedy recovery.

Debate concluded.
                        TRAIN DISASTER IN MOZAMBIQUE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its sympathy and condolences  for  the  loss  of  life  and
       damage to property caused by the tragic railway accident  on  26  May
       2002 in Tenga, Maputo province, in the south of Mozambique, in  which
       more than one hundred lives were lost and about three hundred  people
       injured;


  (2) is fully cognisant of the  economic  difficulties  already  faced  by
       Mozambique, a country that is just emerging from  a  prolonged  civil
       war and which is still recovering from  the  devastating  floods  two
       years ago;


  (3) recognises that Mozambique is  shouldering  the  major  part  of  the
       burden in dealing with the current  tragic  disaster,  but  that  the
       magnitude of devastation and damage  is  far  beyond  the  means  and
       abilities of Mozambique alone to rectify;


  (4) notes with appreciation the swift response of the Government of South
       Africa,  through  its  Ministers  and  government  agencies,  and  of
       nongovernmental organisations and other donors who threw their weight
       behind the relief efforts;


  (5) expresses its gratitude  to  the  officials  of  the  Departments  of
       Provincial  and  Local  Government  and  of   Foreign   Affairs   who
       facilitated the delivery of consignments of gloves, surgical  knives,
       surgical clothes, anaesthetics,  syringes,  bandages  and  drugs  for
       Mozambique;


  (6) also expresses its gratitude  to  the  private  health  care  company
       Netcare and other unnamed private donors for their unwavering support
       in the  relief  efforts  and  to  Southern  Airlink,  who  agreed  to
       transport medical equipment free of charge;


  (7) expresses its solidarity with the government and people of Mozambique
       in facing this complex disaster situation; and


  (8) supports the call made  by  Mozambican  health  authorities  for  the
       donation of medical  equipment  such  as  surgical  blades,  surgical
       clothes, sterile gloves,  urine  collect  bags,  kramer  splints  and
       anaesthetic drugs amongst others.

Motion agreed to in terms of section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 6 - Public Works:
The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, hon members and members who  come
from other provinces and MECs, in my first parliamentary media  briefing  as
Minister of Public Works in August 1999 I identified challenges that  Public
Works has to address. These included better  provision  and  maintenance  of
state accommodation, unlocking the economic potential of the  state's  fixed
property portfolio, intensifying the national public works programme with  a
specific focus on rural development and the further  refinement  of  project
management.

I said that the  department  should  be  managed  as  a  business  on  sound
business principles with due cognisance  given  to  accountability.  I  also
emphasised the need to design systems and procedures in such  a  way  as  to
conform to the requirements of the Auditor-General.

Notable progress has already been made in a number of areas. We  still  need
to work harder at our system to ensure better  financial  accountability  on
specific budgets, for this is a must. Until last  year,  the  Department  of
Public Works had been unable to fully  expend  its  allocation  for  capital
works. We tackled this challenge and found a solution  in  the  introduction
of a Programme for Accelerated Capital Expenditure, or Pace.

Pace is  a  stringent  reporting  and  monitoring  system  to  force  proper
expenditure rates on capital projects and/or to detect  at  an  early  stage
where  underexpenditure  is  occurring  in  order  to  institute  corrective
remedial measures. For the first time, the Department of  Public  Works  has
spent just about 100% of the R1,736 billion budget  allocated  in  the  year
2001-02 for capital works and  planned  maintenance.  We  achieved  this  by
being uncompromising in our attitude and by our focused efforts  to  achieve
operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The Department of  Public  Works  implemented  the  repair  and  maintenance
programme, or Ramp. In the previous financial year, we allocated 46% of  the
department's capital works budget to this programme. For  2002-03,  we  have
allocated an amount of R536 556  000  to  Ramp.  In  order  to  address  the
maintenance  backlog,  the  department  appointed   engineering   firms   to
spearhead the repair and maintenance of prisons and military bases. Now  all
179 prisons in South Africa are  attended  to  under  this  programme.  With
regard to defence, a total of 69 military bases are now  beneficiaries,  and
28 contracts worth R63 million are in progress.

To date, Public Works has awarded repair and  maintenance  contracts  valued
at more than R1,4 billion, with the Department of Correctional  Services  as
the main beneficiary. Using the Asset Procurement and Operating  Partnership
Systems, Apops, the first two maximum security prisons in  South  Africa  to
be designed, financed, built, operated and maintained by the private  sector
as  part  of  Government's  public-private  partnership  initiative   became
operational last year. These are the Mangaung  Maximum  Security  Prison  at
Bloemfontein and the Kutama Sinthumule  Maximum  Security  Prison  at  Louis
Trichardt. Notably, more than R600 million was injected into the economy  of
the two towns during construction.
In response  to  requests  from  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs,  the
Department of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  and  the  Department  of
Education, the  department  will  be  procuring,  through  Apops,  new  head
offices for these departments.

Also completed and officially opening are the medium  and  maximum  security
facilities  and  the  housing  project  at  Kokstad.  Despite  some  initial
teething problems at one stage, the social and economic impact  is  expected
to be the same as in our other  projects.  The  department  recently  handed
over a site to contractors in  Berlin,  Germany,  for  the  commencement  of
construction of the new R115 million South African  embassy.  This  is  just
one of a number of projects that Public Works is procuring on behalf of  the
Department of Foreign Affairs.

Last year, in order to  improve  the  management  of  Government's  property
portfolio, we employed a strategic asset management partner, made  up  of  a
consortium of six local and  international  companies.  This  put  us  in  a
position  to  propose  to  Government  a  government-wide  strategic   asset
management framework. This is a framework that will  give  guidance  to  the
whole of Government, including provincial government, on the  management  of
state properties.

An assessment of  properties  that  have  no  short,  medium  and  long-term
strategic  and  other  value  resulted  in  a  relatively  high  number   of
properties being disposed of during the past financial year. In  total,  the
department disposed of 63 properties for  commercial  purposes  constituting
88 740,3 hectares that brought in revenue of more than R156  million.  Plans
are advanced for an increased number of property disposals  in  the  current
financial year.

Some of the notable disposals include: Fernwood Estate in Cape  Town,  on  a
65-year lease; Brooke's Hill in Port Elizabeth,  which  was  sold  for  R630
000; portion 442 of  the  Randjiesfontein  Farm  in  Midrand  sold  for  R25
million; Erf 151197, better known as Silvermine, sold for R33  million;  and
Toothrock weapons range at Saldanha, disposed of on a 10-year lease at  R875
000 per year, with a 6% escalation.

We are currently working on legislation for  the  envisaged  state  property
management agency, which we hope will enable us to compare  to  or  even  be
better than the best in the industry.

The Department of Public  Works  has  actively  supported  the  land  reform
initiatives of the national Department of Land Affairs, by prioritising  and
expediting the release  of  land  under  the  control  of  Public  Works.  A
dedicated subdirectorate to focus on land reform was created.

The properties that were  part  of  land  reform  projects  that  have  been
successfully concluded in the past financial  year  include:  the  Bethlehem
and Harrismith redistribution project in the  Free  State,  which  comprised
six farms, in extent 1 793 hectares; the Ellison and  Steynberg  restitution
claim in Gauteng, made up of 113  agricultural  holdings  in  Pretoria;  the
Kameelkop restitution claim in the district of  Glencoe,  in  KwaZulu-Natal,
made up of 43 residential erven in Wasbank township, in extent 57  hectares;
the Peeha restitution claim in the district of Soutpansberg in  the  Limpopo
province, made up of five farms, in  extent  5  096  hectares;  the  Lebanon
Fruit Farm Trust redistribution project in the  Western  Cape,  made  up  of
four farms in the district of Caledon, in extent 119 hectares;  the  Algeria
redistribution project in the district of Clanwilliam, in the Western  Cape,
comprising former forestry land, in extent 443  hectares;  and  the  Ndabeni
land redistribution claim in Cape Town, Western Cape, which came out of  the
portion of Wingfield Military Base and adjacent state  land,  in  extent  54
hectares.

Another 160 properties, with an estimated market value of R24 million,  were
also released for land reform purposes. Public Works is also providing  land
to support the development of low-cost housing, mainly at no cost, to  local
authorities and provincial administrations. In the past financial year,  the
department  released  19  properties,  in  extent  600  hectares,  with   an
estimated market value of  R8,6  million,  for  the  provision  of  low-cost
housing and related municipal infrastructure.

The Community-Based Public Works Programme has, since its inception, been  a
programme  of  participation  by  all  levels   of   government,   community
structures, groups and individuals, as well as participation by  established
and   emerging   contractors,   entrepreneurs   and   other   private-sector
enterprises. It  is  a  direct  programme  of  empowerment,  as  it  fosters
technical as well as institutional training and skills  development,  builds
capacity and generates  immediate  development  and  economic  spin-offs  in
previously neglected rural areas, impacting on the lives of the  poorest  of
the poor. It especially targets women, women-headed  households,  the  youth
and the disabled.  In  as  far  as  formal  black  economic  empowerment  is
concerned, I am told that 85%  of  all  the  contractors  participating  are
emerging, historically disadvantaged entrepreneurs.

Our internal publication  on  rural  development  and  poverty  alleviation,
called Tiro, regularly reflects the impact of our  programme  per  province,
helping  to  highlight  the  role  of  the   provinces   in   ensuring   the
effectiveness and success of the Community-Based Public Works  Programme  in
poverty eradication. The build-up starts  at  district  municipality  level,
where integrated development plans are used as a basis for  identifying  the
needs of the communities before these are  submitted  for  consolidation  to
the provincial co-ordinating committees.

Convened by the provincial departments of public works and other  provincial
departments, the  provincial  co-ordinating  committees,  because  of  their
proximity to the projects, play a significant  role  in  the  monitoring  of
these projects, ensuring that  they  deliver  according  to  their  intended
objectives. We are proud to say, as a department,  that  for  the  last  two
consecutive financial years, we have fully  expended  the  budgets  for  the
Community-Based Public Works Programme.

For the financial year 2002-03, in  total,  Public  Works  is  presenting  a
budget of R3,73 billion. The provision for land and  accommodation  accounts
for 86% and the national public works programme for  8,4%  of  this  budget,
leaving less than 6% of our total budget for administration.

For the current financial year, a budget of R274 million has been  allocated
to the Community-Based Public Works  Programme,  covering  a  total  of  263
projects, as against the budget we had  last  year  of  R374  million.  This
allocation is spread over the  provinces.  When  we  started  we  had  three
provinces to cover, which were the poorest  of  the  poor,  and,  as  Public
Works, we decided that we should share the cake with  other  provinces.  The
North West is going to be receiving R10,2 million; Limpopo,  R62,5  million;
Mpumalanga, R21,7 million; KwaZulu-Natal R70 million; the Free  State,  R7,2
million; and the Eastern Cape, R70,2 million.

Some of the key projects  that  we  have  worked  on  include  the  Umlalazi
cluster in KwaZulu-Natal. This cluster comprises 19 projects, including  the
Zulu  Theme  Park  complete  with  10   sea-facing   chalets   for   tourist
accommodation. There is also a community centre that houses a crèche  and  a
facility  for  development  training.  The  inclusive  cost  is  about  R9,2
million.

In Limpopo,  the  department  renovated  a  residential  area  for  disabled
students at Tsoga O Iterele School.  In  addition,  we  donated  mattresses,
chairs, tables and curtains. This year we have set aside R100  000  to  make
further improvements at the school. We are  hoping  in  future  to  build  a
hostel so that the kids will use the school for schooling  by  day  and  the
building at  night  as  sleeping  quarters.  At  the  Elandskraal  Community
Production Centre, the first harvest has just been brought in.

In Mpumalanga the Department of Public Works allocated  R1  million  towards
the establishment of the Cairn Lemon Community Production Centre,  which  is
now ready and fully functional, awaiting its first  harvest  of  lemon  oil.
Already negotiations are at an advanced stage to sell the  lemon  oil  to  a
big multinational beverage-producing company in America.

In the Eastern Cape on 8 June 2002 the Deputy President  will  be  launching
yet another community production centre  at  Highlands  near  Umzimkulu.  We
have budgeted R1,5 million for this project  during  the  current  financial
year. In discussion with the premiers of the Eastern Cape and  KwaZulu-Natal
we have in mind a proposal to create a cross-border CPC which will  actually
involve Highlands and the area where there has been  a  lot  of  strife  for
some time.

In the North West province, which was the  latest  to  join  the  Community-
Based Public Works community projects in 2000-01, some  projects  have  been
built, which include a  bakery,  a  brick-making  facility,  several  school
renovations, garden projects and community halls. For the current  financial
year we  are  also  assisting  in  combating  HIV/Aids  by  providing  three
infrastructure support projects for R426 000. We have also budgeted for  one
community production centre at R1,9 million.

In conclusion, allow  me  to  express  my  appreciation  for  the  good  co-
operation from  all  the  provincial  leadership,  in  particular  the  MECs
concerned and also from members of this House. I  know  that  our  officials
are jointly trying their level best to ensure successful implementation  and
for that I thank them all.

The NCOP can help in addressing the challenge to cascade  to  the  provinces
the capacity to expend capital and  poverty  relief  budgets.  No  obstacles
should  stand  in  the  way  of  ensuring  that   provinces   achieve   100%
expenditure. Another challenge is to  ensure  that  all  properties  of  the
state are registered. The ongoing work on the management and maintenance  of
the asset register must be pursued with more vigour.

The NCOP can help us identify those assets created  by  Government  for  the
benefit of communities that are not optimally  used  so  that  we  can  find
alternative uses for such assets.  It  is  also  my  belief  that  a  better
working relationship with the NCOP is essential, for there  is  a  lot  that
can be accomplished in the provinces with the guidance of the NCOP. We  will
make sure that from now on we  tighten  and  strengthen  that  relationship.
[Applause.]

Ms P  C  P  MAJODINA:  Mr  Chairperson,  Minister  Sigcau,  Deputy  Minister
Mfundisi Zondi, MECs, special delegates and hon members, I greet you all  in
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [Interjections.]

The national Department of Public Works is  one  of  the  biggest  potential
role-players in the fight against poverty, in  state  asset  management,  in
job creation and in the development of  the  country.  Whilst  the  progress
made by the Department of Public Works thus far is significant, there is  no
doubt that there are a number of outstanding critical areas  and  challenges
that need to be improved and addressed.

The department's concept of  multipurpose  community  centres  was  a  well-
thought-out idea and should be kept up. Poverty levels  are  still  rife  in
many parts of  our  country.  Poverty  relief  programmes  are  one  of  the
critical strategies of assisting the poor.
In his  state  of  the  nation  address  the  President  identified  poverty
eradication as one of the major challenges confronting South Africa. In  his
speech he emphasised the need to focus on the  fight  against  poverty.  The
struggle to  eradicate  poverty  and  underdevelopment  in  our  country  is
fundamental to the achievement of our national goal to build  a  caring  and
people-centred society.

One of the most important goals of the Public  Works  programme  is  poverty
alleviation. The Community-Based Public Works  Programme  was  initiated  to
alleviate  poverty  through  job  creation,  capacity-building  and   skills
training. The programme was also aimed  at  reducing  the  vulnerability  of
poor rural communities, rural  women,  the  youth  and  disabled  people  by
creating both short-term and long-term employment opportunities.

The Department of Public Works indicated that it  would  phase  out  poverty
relief programmes in the MTEF. This raises serious concerns,  as  this  will
deprive many people of the potential to survive. While there is  a  need  to
review some of the  poverty  alleviation  programmes,  the  phasing  out  of
poverty relief  will  disadvantage  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  This  also
contradicts the President's call to fight poverty.

South  Africa  is  currently  confronted  by  the  challenge  of   providing
habitable shelter for the millions of homeless people. One  of  the  factors
that inhibit the provision  of  houses  is  the  availability  of  land  and
therefore the Department of Public Works needs to work together  with  other
departments in addressing the housing backlog. The  department  can  play  a
key role by making the acquisition of land  for  housing  the  poor  one  of
their priorities, given the  extent  of  the  housing  backlog.  The  budget
allocation does not reflect land acquisition as a priority. There is a  need
for spending targeted towards land acquisition for  housing.  Whilst  Public
Works is disposing of land, Housing is in need of that  land.  Therefore  we
need an integrated development plan among the departments.

The renewal of schools, hospitals and other social institutions  is  another
major challenge that causes concern. In most provinces, if  not  all,  there
are schools, clinics and  other  institutions  that  are  in  an  unpleasant
condition. Provincial departments of public works often  lack  capacity  and
resources to fulfil their  objectives.  Therefore  the  national  department
should take responsibility by assisting and supporting provinces  to  remedy
the situation.

Whilst the Department of Public Works has made remarkable improvements  with
regard to managing  state  property  and  accommodating  other  departments,
there is no doubt that there are areas where there are concerns.  There  are
still many instances where public funds are spent to pay for buildings  that
are no longer occupied by the Government. In some instances the  maintenance
of buildings not owned by  Government  is  borne  by  public  funds  due  to
irregularities in terms of lease agreements. This is unacceptable. It  needs
to be attended to as a high priority.

The Department of Public Works needs to put  proper  and  effective  systems
and control in place to prevent  such  irregularities,  since  they  utilise
state funds which could be spent in a manner that empowers the poor  people.
This means that the asset register needs  to  be  improved  drastically  and
also be brought up to date to avoid irregularities.

There are a number of areas where the Department of Public  Works  needs  to
work closely with other  departments  for  effective  service  delivery.  An
example is the issue of rural roads.  When  the  issue  of  rural  roads  is
raised, no department owns up to the problem. As a result,  no  progress  is
made.  The  Department  of  Public  Works  should  work  closely  with   the
Department of Transport to ensure that service  delivery  takes  place  with
regard to rural roads. Our people in the rural areas do  not  want  to  know
about taking of roads as proclaimed access or whatever it  is  called;  what
they need are roads.

Given the fact that  the  Department  of  Public  Works  functions  at  both
national and provincial levels, it  also  makes  an  important  contribution
towards intergovernmental relations and co-operative  governance.  Provinces
have increasing responsibilities for implementation,  and  given  that  most
public works activities occur at provincial level, the Department of  Public
Works through the hon the Minister has recognised that her department has  a
particular responsibility to ensure co-ordination and coherence between  the
three tiers of government.

The Working for  Water  programme  is  another  shining  example  of  a  co-
operative and integrated approach between the Departments  of  Public  Works
and of Water Affairs and Forestry. This project  has  seen  the  removal  of
alien vegetation and, in the process, a number of jobs have been created.

In conclusion, the Department of Public Works is one of the  most  potential
role-players in job creation,  in  effective  public  service  delivery,  in
economic and social empowerment of previously marginalised  communities  and
in the fight against poverty. However, the Department of Public Works has  a
number of challenges  to  overcome  in  order  for  effective  Public  Works
service delivery to be realised. I therefore support this Budget Vote.

Mr P G  MASUALLE  (Eastern  Cape):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  Deputy
Minister present here, my colleagues: the MECs  from  other  provinces,  and
distinguished members of this House, we are very pleased to  participate  in
this debate on the Vote of the Department of Public Works. From  the  outset
I really want to welcome the comments made by the Minister, particularly  as
she was pointing to the challenge before all of us and the  role  that  this
House can  play  in  building  and  forging  better  relations  between  the
provinces as well as the Department of Public Works.

This is critically important in the context  of  the  functions  that  these
departments are expected to perform. I am sure that  better  clarity  and  a
better service to the people out there will emerge when we interact more.

I will be speaking on the input by the Minister, particularly in  the  arena
of the Community-Based Public Works Programme. I want  to  agree  and  align
myself with the previous speaker who has really put forward  the  centrality
of the question of poverty, the need to eradicate  poverty  in  our  country
and the role that the Department of Public Works can play in that context.

Our experience is that since  the  implementation  of  this  Community-Based
Public Works Programme, no less than R159 million  has  been  spent  in  our
province thus far on an array of projects with  very  inspiring  indications
in terms of achievements that have been made. Just  in  terms  of  jobs,  in
excess of 42 000 jobs have been created thus far, 29  000  being  jobs  that
accommodate women. Another 13 000 of those have been  jobs  from  which  the
youth of our country has benefited.

We think  that  this  is  indeed  quite  significant,  because  one  of  the
fundamental tasks that  this  democratic  Government  has  is  altering  and
ensuring that there is a revival of the rural  economies.  Emerging  from  a
rural province like ours, the question of  income  distribution  is  central
and this programme, in many respects, has made significant inroads.

The promotion  of  the  previously  discriminated  against  sectors  in  the
economy is but a fundamental imperative that must be achieved  or  addressed
by this Government. Indeed, we are  very  proud  to  say  that  through  the
Community-Based Public Works Programme, we have seen significant strides  in
that regard.

Again, in as far as promoting the rural economies is concerned, one  of  the
flagship programmes which has been championed by a number of departments  in
the clustered approach that central Government champions, has been  the  SDI
programme. Again, through the Community-Based  Public  Works  Programme,  we
have been able, in co-operation with the  national  department,  to  make  a
significant  contribution  with  a  view  to  achieving  or  leveraging  the
potential that the province has in terms  of  tourism  and  in  terms  of  a
number of related sectors that benefit once tourism is unleashed.

I may also say that through the targeted procurement system, a  system  that
has been championed by the national department, we have been able to  affirm
a number of emerging business  enterprises,  emerging  contractors  and  the
previously disadvantaged professional institutions.  That  has  indeed  been
done through the pioneering work that has been led and co-ordinated  by  the
national department.

We do think that there remain some challenges that we need to confront  and,
indeed,  wherever  work  is  done,  there  are  always   opportunities   and
challenges that are created by that work. One area which  the  Minister  has
already alluded to is the role that the  national  department  can  play  in
terms of  sharing  expertise,  ensuring  that  the  best  practices  can  be
exchanged between provinces. The Minister has alluded to the fact that  they
have been able to expend their entire budget for  infrastructure.  It  is  a
matter that, of  course,  stands  before  us  and  asks  how  we  can  begin
exchanging those lessons in an interactive way so that  there  can  also  be
improvements of that magnitude in the provinces.
I also want to raise the question of better co-ordination so as  to  achieve
uniformity across all the programmes that were undertaken by the  department
and undertaken at the level of the provinces, because it would  not  give  a
very good impression if one were to go into an office in  the  province  and
get a level of service that is not the same as that  in  another  office  in
the same province. Surely this brings  to  the  fore  the  question  of  co-
ordination so as to achieve uniformity across the country?

The third issue, which is also a critical one, is an expanded vision of  the
role of the Department of Public Works in  the  context  of  the  challenges
that confront the country as a whole.  Those  that  are  learned  enough  to
understand the economy of this country, have come  to  the  conclusion  that
despite the strides that have been made and the level  of  growth  that  has
indeed been achieved, jobs continue to be lost. In that context,  what  role
can be played by the department to ensure that it becomes  some  kind  of  a
net to really absorb and create new  opportunities  for  those  people  that
continue to be without jobs? Surely we do  think  that  the  department  can
play a role? It is inherent in its name - the way it is called - that it  is
the department whose focal point is, indeed, Public Works.

We think  that  together  we  can,  through  interaction,  create  a  better
platform and therefore create space and  relevance  for  the  department  in
terms of the challenges that lie ahead. Surely  the  budget  that  has  been
presented by  the  department  is  poised  to  make  some  strides  in  that
direction? And, we believe that we can make it  with  better  co-ordination.
[Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL:  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  die  slagspreuk  wat  die  departement
ongeveer vyf jaar gelede  aangeneem  het,  naamlik  ``Mintiro  yavulavula'',
oftewel ``Aksies spreek luider as woorde'', is 'n  baie  gepaste  slagspreuk
waarmee ek my graag self vereenselwig. Deur  verskillende  stappe  te  doen,
het die agb Minister wel daarin geslaag om die ou Departement  van  Openbare
Werke, wat in die verlede erge kritiek uitgelok het oor sy  onvermoë  om  te
lewer, op die oog af beter te laat lyk.

C J Langenhoven het op 'n keer gesê: ``Die man wat ek soek, is nie  die  een
wat die minste foute maak nie, maar die een wat die meeste foute  regmaak.''
[Tussenwerpsels.] Dit kan dan ook geld  vir  die  departement,  wat  in  die
verlede vele foute begaan het. Die departement kon dan ook daarin  slaag  om
een groot fout van die verlede, naamlik onderbesteding,  reg  te  stel  deur
vir die eerste keer 100% van  die  bedrag  in  die  begroting  toegeken  vir
kapitale werke en onderhoud te bestee. Ek wil  die  agb  Minister  gelukwens
met die regstel van  hierdie  fout.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Dr P J  C  NEL:  Mr  Chairperson,  the  motto  adopted  by  the  department
approximately five years ago, namely  ``Mintiro  yavulavula'',  or  ``Action
speaks louder than words'', is a very appropriate motto with which I  gladly
identify.  By  taking  various  steps,  the  hon  the  Minister  has  indeed
succeeded in making the old Department of Public Works, which  in  the  past
elicited strong criticism about its inability to  deliver,  look  better  on
the surface.

C J Langenhoven once said: ``Die man wat ek soek, is nie  die  een  wat  die
minste foute maak nie, maar die eeen wat die meeste  foute  regmaak.''  [The
man I seek, is not the one who has made the least mistakes, but the one  who
has rectified the most mistakes.]  [Interjections.]  This  could  then  also
apply to  the  department,  which  in  the  past  made  many  mistakes.  The
department was then also able to succeed in correcting one big mistake  from
the past, namely underspending, by spending 100% of the amount allocated  in
the budget for capital works and maintenance for the first time. I  want  to
congratulate the hon the Minister on rectifying this mistake.]

It would seem that  despite  its  infancy,  the  Programme  for  Accelerated
Capital Expenditure, pace, is beginning to yield results.

I would also like to compliment the hon the Minister on  the  public-private
partnership  initiative  known  as  the  Asset  Procurement  and   Operating
Partnership System, or Apops, in Bloemfontein.

The Mangaung Maximum Security Prison is the first prison in South Africa  to
be designed,  financed,  built,  operated  and  maintained  by  the  private
sector. This initiative, as we have heard from the hon the  Minister  today,
injected many millions of rands into the economy of Bloemfontein during  its
construction, and created economic opportunities for the community.

The building programme published  in  the  memorandum  by  the  Minister  of
Public Works is quite impressive. As a representative  from  the  Goldfields
in the Free State, I am  very  excited  to  notice  in  the  programme  that
eventually funds were allocated to that part of the  world  for  the  repair
and  upgrading  of  police  stations  in  Virginia,   Welkom,   Wesselsbron,
Odendaalsrus, Henneman and Theunissen.

Die grootste gedeelte van die geld is egter  bewillig  vir  die  opgradering
van polisieselle en lykshuise. Behalwe in die geval van Welkom en  Virginia,
is  geen  geld  toegelaat  vir  die  herstel  en  opgradeer   of   bou   van
polisiekantore nie. In  die  meeste  gevalle  is  die  polisiegeboue  in  'n
vervalle toestand en het dringende aandag nodig.  Veral  in  die  geval  van
Bronville is dit  baie  dringend  noodsaaklik,  want  die  kantoor  is  tans
gehuisves in 'n klein woonhuisie  wat  sowat  30  jaar  gelede  al  vir  die
polisiekommissaris gebou is. Die polisiekantoor is egter  nooit  gebou  nie,
ten spyte van die feit dat die bevolking van die dorp van  30  000  tot  230
000 gegroei het.

Volgens my  wete  is  daar  wel  deur  die  Departement  van  Veiligheid  en
Sekuriteit aansoek gedoen vir fondse by verskeie geleenthede oor 'n  tydperk
van 30 jaar. Die reaksie was nog altyd dat daar  nie  fondse  beskikbaar  is
nie, ten spyte van die feit dat die bou van die kantoor 'n paar jaar  gelede
nommer een op die prioriteitslys was.

Mens kan kwalik verwag dat die polisie, wat gedurig te doen het  met  geweld
en misdaad sowel as 'n personeeltekort en 'n tekort aan  voertuie  en  ander
hulpmiddele, ook nog hul  werk  moet  doen  in  'n  klein,  warm,  bedompige
vertrekkie. Ek hoop dat die agb Minister ons vandag kan gerusstel met  goeie
nuus in dié verband om sodoende ook hierdie foutjie reg te stel.

'n Ander baie belangrike faktor  wat  groot  onrus  in  die  harte  van  die
gemeenskap veroorsaak, is die astronomiese agterstande wat oor die  afgelope
dekade opgebou het  ten  opsigte  van  die  herstel  en  onderhoud  van  ons
infrastruktuur, soos paaie, spoorlyne en staatsgeboue. Ons het 'n  paar  dae
gelede gehoor van die Departement van Vervoer  dat  die  agterstand  in  die
herstel en onderhoud van die padnetwerk ongeveer R40 miljard beloop.

Die agterstand op die spoorwegstelsel se infrastruktuur is R22 miljard.  Die
komitee moes onlangs ook van die amptenare van hierdie  departement  verneem
dat  daar  reeds  in  die  jaar  2000  op  die  herstel  en  onderhoud   van
staatsgeboue 'n agterstand van bykans R10 miljard  was.  Amptenare  kon  nie
die gekose komitee 'n bevredigende antwoord gee oor watter inisiatiewe  deur
die departement geneem word om hierdie baie groot  probleem  aan  te  spreek
nie.  Die  versuim  om  betyds  geld  te  bestee   aan   die   herstel   van
infrastruktuur is 'n groot fout, want hoe langer gewag word, hoe  meer  gaan
dit kos om die agterstand in te haal. (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[However, the largest portion of the money was allocated for  the  upgrading
of police cells and mortuaries. With the exception of Welkom  and  Virginia,
no money was allowed for  the  restoration  and  upgrading  or  building  of
police offices. In most cases the police  buildings  are  in  a  dilapidated
condition and  require  urgent  attention.  In  the  case  of  Bronville  in
particular,  this  is  very  urgently  necessary,  because  the  office   is
currently housed in a small  residence  which  was  built  approximately  30
years ago for the police commissioner. However, the police office was  never
built, despite the fact that the population of the town has  grown  from  30
000 to 230 000.

According to my knowledge the Department of Safety and Security  did  indeed
apply for funds on  various  occasions  over  a  period  of  30  years.  The
reaction was always that funding was not available, despite the fact that  a
number of years ago the building  of  the  office  was  number  one  on  the
priority list.

One can hardly expect that the police, who  constantly  have  to  deal  with
violence and crime as well as the  shortage  of  staff  and  a  shortage  of
vehicles and other resources, must also still do  their  jobs  in  a  small,
hot, stuffy little room.  I  hope  that  today  the  hon  the  Minister  can
reassure us with good news  in  this  regard  to  also  rectify  this  small
mistake.

Another very important factor which causes great concern in  the  hearts  of
the community relates to the astronomical backlogs which have built up  over
the  past  decade  with  regard  to  the  repair  and  maintenance  of   our
infrastructure, such as roads, railway lines and our state buildings. A  few
days ago we heard from the Department of Transport that the backlog  in  the
repair and maintenance of the road  network  amounts  to  approximately  R40
billion.

The backlog in the infrastructure of the railway system is R22 billion.  The
committee also learnt recently from the officials of the department that  in
the year 2000 there was already a backlog of approximately R10 billion  with
regard to the repair and maintenance of  state  buildings.  Officials  could
not give the select committee a satisfactory answer about  what  initiatives
are being taken by the department to address this very problem. The  failure
to spend money timeously on the repair of infrastructure is a  big  mistake,
because the longer one waits, the more it is going to cost to eliminate  the
backlog.]

Proper maintenance of our infrastructure is a prerequisite for  development,
for growth, for prosperity and for the eradication of poverty. [Applause.]

Mr S M A MALEBO (Free State): Thank you, Chairperson. Dit is regtig  'n  eer
om ná kollega Nel te volg. [It is truly an honour to speak  after  colleague
Nel.]

The mandate of Public Works is broader than being  the  custodian  of  state
assets. We have been tasked, amongst other things, to lead in the  provision
and maintenance of physical infrastructure for Government. In  carrying  out
this mandate, we must enhance the capacity of the construction  industry  in
a  manner  that  increases  our  GDP.  The  construction  industry   is   as
significant to the economy and its growth as the manufacturing sector.

Central to executing this mandate is ensuring that we  attack  poverty,  not
to alleviate it, but to eradicate it. In the words of  our  President,  ``we
must roll back the frontiers of poverty''. It is therefore  crucial  for  us
to understand the centrality of Public Works as a leverage of change. It  is
a strategic department to deliver infrastructure in a manner  that  empowers
our communities with social amenities, but we must do so in  a  manner  that
develops the poor and the unskilled, and creates both long-term  and  short-
term job opportunities, given the fact  that  the  economy  has  experienced
growth in joblessness, which has led to no  income  for  many  families.  No
income for families means an increase in poverty  ratings,  an  increase  in
the number of  the  poor,  and  an  increase  in  the  number  of  destitute
families. This House must know that the allocation to provinces  in  respect
of both total revenue collected and poverty eradication  must  be  revisited
if the allocation is based on the poverty ratings of provinces.

The Free  State  province  is  regarded  as  the  second  poorest  province,
according to a study on household income per province as  a  determinant  of
poverty levels.  If  this  is  indeed  so,  then  the  allocations  must  be
revisited. It is a fact that most families that are dependent on social  and
old age pensions are better off than many families that are employed in  the
Free State, who earn far less than the pension of R570 per month.  In  other
words, it is  better  to  be  unemployed  and  to  receive  an  old  age  or
disability pension than to work, for many people in the Free State.

In our effort to address poverty in  our  province,  the  executive  council
identified the Garieb district as the second poorest area in the Free  State
and declared it its second nodal point, after  the  President  had  declared
Thabo Mofutsanyane district council as a  nodal  point.  The  intention  is,
through infrastructural development,  to  create  jobs,  grow  the  economy,
upgrade the skills levels of the unemployed, and raise  the  literacy  level
to reduce our poverty ratings. This is the task of Public Works and this  is
our mandate in the democratic order.

To this end, various projects throughout  the  breadth  and  length  of  the
province are under way. The department has running projects to the  tune  of
R100 million for the Department of Education, R60 million  for  Health,  R10
million for Social Development, R6 million  for  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism, and R9 million for Sports, Arts and  Culture.  To  ensure  that  we
deliver, and no roll-overs happen, all work was planned in the last  quarter
of the  previous  financial  year,  and  the  department  started  with  the
execution of all projects as of the first day of the new financial year.
The execution of all planned projects that  have  been  budgeted  for  is  a
crucial part of the construction enhancement programme. Of the R185  million
spent in the last year, 85% was allocated  to  black  emerging  contractors,
and, for the first time this year, at  least  one  woman-owned  construction
company was appointed  for  a  contract  of  R2  million.  This  trend  must
continue and the  value  must  increase.  If  we  are  to  tackle  the  huge
maintenance backlog of  buildings,  estimated  at  45%  and  valued  at  R16
billion, we must revisit the allocations according to need.

Land  must  be  released  quickly  for  development  purposes  to  speed  up
delivery. To realise this, special efforts have been  undertaken  to  ensure
that both the Departments of  Public  Works  and  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs release  land  for  development  faster  to  ensure  that  essential
projects for schools,  clinics,  hospitals,  etc,  are  constructed  in  the
shortest lead time.

The major challenge, we all agree, facing the Department of Public Works  is
to embark on a national job creation project that will provide a  long-term,
labour-intensive project to provide jobs of a long-term  nature,  10  to  15
years, to our unemployed people. We must not  fool  ourselves;  the  private
sector will never do this, it  is  not  interested  in  this.  This  is  the
challenge for  Government,  and  the  Department  of  Public  Works  is  the
department that can do this. I stand in support of the Vote. [Applause.]

Mr  N  M  RAJU:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  special  delegates,  hon
colleagues, let me at the outset place on record my party's  acknowledgement
and appreciation of the untiring efforts of the Ministry and the  Department
of Public Works, and the laudable initiatives already taken to ward off  the
tentacles of poverty, especially on  rural  communities,  in  its  focus  on
infrastructure such as clinics, police stations,  schools,  dams,  community
multifunction halls and the like.

The Community-Based Public Works Programme, as  a  rural-biased  development
strategy, has worked wonders in creating employment opportunities for small-
time subcontractors, especially from  the  local  communities.  But  it  has
emerged from briefings and hearings that some of these  subcontractors,  who
are obviously attempting to take their first steps  up  the  ladder  towards
self-sufficiency and a modicum of prosperity, are often  exploited  and  not
paid in good time  by  their  principal  contractors,  some  of  whom  often
collect the payments for themselves and disappear.

This is a serious concern that needs to be addressed. The disadvantaged,  it
would seem, are being further disadvantaged when due payment for  work  done
is not forthcoming. Unscrupulous operators in the  construction  and  repair
and maintenance sector must be identified and blacklisted, so as not to  let
them further enjoy the fruits of state tender.

However, we note with approbation that emerging black contractors  undertake
some 34,5% of the department's capital works in the  Community-Based  Public
Works Programme's poverty relief programmes. This is indeed a far  cry  from
the 4% involvement in 1995.

Let me dwell for a moment on the disposal of state properties. Yes,  as  the
Minister once remarked, the state owns a huge estate and the  Department  of
Public Works is the manager of this huge estate. It is an  asset  management
function to identify and  dispose  of  redundant  properties.  The  disposal
strategy must obviously be aimed at ridding Government  of  superfluous  and
redundant properties in order to contain costs  associated  with  management
and maintenance.

Some of these properties remain unutilised and  underutilised  for  decades.
In September 2000 the hon the Minister, in her reply to a  question,  stated
that some 88 properties that had been  identified  as  being  redundant  and
were in a bad state of disrepair had been disposed  of  by  the  state.  The
department also indicated that some properties, mostly in former  homelands,
would be put on the market or sold to local municipalities.

We have information that on the East Rand, for instance in  places  such  as
Boksburg North, state properties and buildings  have  been  lying  idle  and
unused for 50 to 80 years. Initially they were intended for  use  as  police
stations or schools, but over the years the need for use did not  arise,  so
they were left for the sole occupation of  ghosts.  But  because  the  local
authorities  continued  to  cut  the  grass,  remove  the  rubble,   install
electricity and provide water, etc, can  we  not  now  hand  these  over  at
nominal prices and let the local authorities begin to rejuvenate  the  towns
and suburbs, thus maximising the  use  of  these  properties  for  the  sole
benefit of the communities?

I would like to say something on the question of leasing. On the subject  of
leasing of properties by the state, there is no  doubt  that  many  property
owners have exploited Government or unfortunately have been  found  wanting,
in its inadequate capacity,  to  manage  the  leases.  The  certainty  of  a
guaranteed income has made many landlords  greedy.  Some  of  the  buildings
leased by the state are often health and safety hazards, and it is the  most
vulnerable in our communities, the poor, the  aged  and  the  disabled,  who
have to use these  buildings  and  contend  with  the  derelict  and  poorly
maintained properties. We therefore underline the urgent need  for  a  fresh
and thorough renegotiation of leases, especially in  cases  where  buildings
are in a serious state of disrepair.

It is with dismay that my party notes  that  there  have  been  cases  where
leases have  expired,  and  yet  the  state,  or  is  it  Father  Christmas,
continues payments long after leases have lapsed. Such shoddy management  of
state leasing is untenable, and drastic action must be taken.

All in all, we support the hon the Minister in her tireless efforts to  make
the Department of Public Works work.

Mr C G TSOTETSI (Gauteng): Chairperson, the Department of Public  Transport,
Roads and Works in Gauteng manages a  total  budget  of  approximately  R1,2
billion.

The transport branch  manages  the  transport  and  roads  budget  directly,
whilst the public works branch manages both the departmental budget as  well
as client departments' budgets on an urgency basis. The  biggest  client  of
the department is the Gauteng Department of Health. The department does  not
service the Gauteng Department  of  Education,  which  has  its  own  public
works.

The budget for the public works branch for the previous financial  year  was
R439 million, that is, excluding the budgets  from  other  departments.  The
strategic priorities of public works are job creation, the new public  works
business model, the asset management  strategy,  partnership  programmes  in
the provision of infrastructure for social services, that is the  Community-
Based Public  Works  Programme,  licence  fee  revenue  optimisation,  human
resource development, procurement reform, black economic empowerment  and  a
special project called Zivuseni, which is led by the MEC.

Regarding the Community-Based Public  Works  Programme,  the  department  is
handling about 32 projects which are valued at R45  million,  73%  of  which
have been  implemented  through  the  partnership.  The  current  budget  is
inadequate to deal with infrastructure backlogs in marginalised  areas.  The
department has enough capacity to  deal  with  funded  projects  per  annum;
however, community demand outstrips supply.

Let me deal with the construction industry development programme. The  focus
for Gauteng has been the  development  of  the  small  emerging  contractors
through the Khubakhi  programmme.  Fifty-two  contractors  are  being  taken
through the programme from level 1 to level 5. As they progress through  the
levels, the assistance provided by the department is  reduced  gradually  as
well as the protection in terms of the tendering process. By the  time  they
reach level 5, they are able to manage their  businesses  independently  and
tender independently for bigger jobs. A new intake is expected to  be  taken
in this financial year.

The main strategy to deal with maintenance backlogs is through the  hospital
rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  programme.  The  province  sets   aside
approximately  R150  million  annually  for  this  purpose.   Through   this
programme we have been able to revamp  hospitals  and  build  new  hospitals
where it is economically viable,  for  example,  the  building  of  the  new
Pretoria academic hospital at R265 million and the Rehabilitation  of  Chris
Hani Baragwanath and Edenvale Hospitals at the cost of R40 million and  Wits
Dental School at R11 million.

The second aspect of the strategy has been to conduct a status quo  analysis
of all facilities in  order  to  improve  the  data  quality  and  strategic
decision-making. This has enabled us to carry  out  conditional  assessments
of  all  our  hospitals,  clinics,  welfare  institutions  and  recreational
facilities. The data collected has given us a realistic picture of what  the
actual maintenance backlogs are  per  building.  The  information  has  also
enabled us to make strategic decisions on where to spend money  economically
as well as where not to spend money because the cost may be  prohibitive  or
not cost effective.

The estimated current maintenance  budget  required  for  health  facilities
amounts to R286 million, including R128  million  for  backlog  maintenance.
This figure is 5,4% of the current construction costs of  R5,3  billion.  If
these maintenance backlogs were to be eradicated in the next three years  at
a cost escalation of 7,5% per annum, the following additional  budget  would
be required: for the first year R200 million;  for  the  second  year,  R217
million; for the third year, R236 million.

Maintenance costs would therefore be substantially reduced  if  we  were  to
invest substantial amounts for maintenance in  the  next  three  years.  The
budget for maintenance for the current financial year is R333  million.  The
average condition of Gauteng  health  facilities  is  3,8  on  a  five-point
scale. Most buildings require minor repairs, with  painting  and  fixing  of
roofs  and  ceilings  requiring  the  most  urgent  attention.  In  general,
electrical and mechanical installations are in an above  average  condition.
The worst average condition is that  of  sites,  civil  works  and  gardens,
which give the impression that facilities are in a  state  of  neglect.  The
money that Gauteng province has set aside for Zivuseni will go  a  long  way
in eradicating this perception whilst alleviating poverty.

The province has acquired the said fixed asset management  system  in  order
to control and update its asset register. The system not only  captures  the
assets but enables the province to manage its  properties  effectively.  For
example, it records occupation rates,  space  utilisation,  maintenance  and
the costs of managing the assets so that strategic  decisions  can  be  made
about properties. The province has fixed assets valued at approximately  R12
billion which it manages. The aim is to optimise both  the  social  and  the
market value  of  assets  by  effectively  and  efficiently  managing  these
assets. An  asset  management  strategy  is  in  place  which  helps  us  to
determine  how  to  manage  the  fixed  assets  portfolio,   in   terms   of
acquisitions and disposals as well  as  the  operation  and  maintenance  of
these assets.

Projects that are in  progress  include  the  Community-Based  Public  Works
Programmes, which has 32 projects, the labour-intensive  programme  with  90
projects, the labour maximisation  programme,  the  Potlaka  programme,  the
Zivuseni project, the  Pretoria  academic  hospital  project,  the  Strijdom
Square restoration, Chris  Hani  Baragwanath  Hospital,  Edenvale  Hospital,
black  economic  empowerment,  job  creation,  the  total  asset  management
strategy and Wits Dental School.

These are the key challenges facing our province:  to  increase  the  budget
for Community-Based Public  Works  in  order  to  deal  with  infrastructure
backlogs in marginalised areas; to  increase  the  budget  for  Zivuseni  in
order to deal with poverty and unemployment in  the  province;  to  increase
maintenance budgets in order to eradicate backlogs and thus reduce costs  in
the long term; to continue investing  in  the  hospital  reconstruction  and
rehabilitation  programme  in  order  to  continue   providing   world-class
facilities and service to  the  people  of  Gauteng  and  the  rest  of  the
country; to create as many jobs as possible while developing  infrastructure
for  social  services;  to  improve  the   condition   of   all   government
infrastructure to level 4 in such a way that it affords respect and  dignity
to the communities of Gauteng; to remain the service provider of  choice  on
merit for all our client departments; to reduce infrastructure  backlogs  in
the marginalised areas; to optimise the  social  and  market  value  of  the
fixed asset portfolio of government; and to continue  with  the  development
of black economic empowerment.

The ANC Government is very clear on what  needs  to  be  done  in  terms  of
providing accelerated service delivery to the people of South Africa. It  is
also clear on the need to create jobs or conditions conducive to  employment
creation.  Given  this  clear  vision  the  Gauteng  department  of   public
transport, roads and works is committed to implementing  its  strategies  in
order to ensure that the government delivers on  its  promise  to  create  a
better  life  for  all  in  South  Africa.  Gauteng  supports  the   budget.
[Applause.]

Mr J S MABONA (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, Minister of  Public  Works,  Deputy
Minister, all colleagues from provinces and hon members of this  House,  the
province of Mpumalanga appreciates the support and  interest  shown  by  the
national Minister over the past year, and in particular the  personal  visit
to the province by the hon the Minister, Stella Sigcau, to inspect  most  of
the projects  undertaken  in  terms  of  the  Community-Based  Public  Works
Programme.

When one visits these projects it becomes apparent that  some  projects  are
more successful than others. Although provinces  are  requested  to  play  a
monitoring role in the execution of national projects this role is  somewhat
limited and confined to certain issues only.  The  community,  public  works
projects are specifically aimed at the extremely needy  poverty  pockets  in
the country and will make a difference in many communities. It is  for  this
reason that not a single less successful project  can  be  afforded  in  the
context of  the  extremely  limited  resources  available  at  national  and
provincial level.
A co-ordinated approach amongst all three levels of government is  therefore
a prerequisite for success, more than ever before. The  national  department
took a decision some three years ago that provinces cannot  be  players  and
referees at the same time, and rightly so. But certain  provinces  developed
skills and expertise to embark  on  such  projects  and  are  continuing  to
execute community public works projects,  although  confined  to  a  limited
budget, in the devolving  of  national  projects  to  district  councils  as
implementing agents. This expertise might not  be  available  to  all  these
agencies, especially to those district councils that are already finding  it
difficult to render basic services to poverty-stricken  communities.  It  is
for this reason that I would like to offer more assistance  from  provincial
level to these three councils.

With the reality  of  an  ever-diminishing  budget  at  all  levels  of  the
government, the first casualty  is  always  the  maintenance  fund,  to  the
detriment of the immovable property portfolio of government. This  situation
is even  more  serious  since  the  implementation  of  the  Public  Finance
Management  Act.  In  terms  of  this  Act,  client  departments  especially
education, health and welfare, should budget  for  the  maintenance  of  the
fixed assets under their control. This,  unfortunately,  does  not  get  the
necessary attention  and  leads  to  an  even  more  diminishing  budget  to
maintain such assets  from  this  department.  A  co-ordinated  approach  to
budgeting is therefore essential, even if it means prescriptive measures  by
the Department of Finance similar to those prescribing the 85%-15%  division
of provincial budgets for education, health and welfare purposes. We  cannot
allow a single bridge to be built when we are burning them behind us.

As a result of the limited financial resources at our disposal, the  backlog
in  the  maintenance  of  government  buildings  and  the  construction   of
community facilities such as crèches and halls, to mention  but  a  few,  is
very huge. At this point in time we only  attend  to  emergency  maintenance
work in day-to-day or  routine  maintenance.  Without  financial  resources,
preventative maintenance work cannot be attended to.
I must also tell the Minister that this Government's community public  works
project has helped  a  lot  of  people  in  the  poverty-stricken  areas  of
Mpumalanga. If this project had not been commissioned,  those  people  would
go to bed hungry.

Lastly I must say, Mr Minister that one of the  critical  points  that  this
Government must attend to is the issue of implementing the policy of  taking
those who were disadvantaged before into the mainstream of the economy.  The
Act as it stands exposes black contractors  to  more  powerful  contractors,
and hence they become  fronts.  I  doubt  hon  members  could  show  me  one
emerging contractor who has not been exploited  in  this  regard.  All  over
this country the Government gives projects to joint ventures,  but,  at  the
end of  the  day,  those  marginalised  ones  remain  poor.  Some  of  these
contractors are actually sequestrated by the courts  precisely  because  one
finds few patriots among the big contractors.

I must say, Mr Minister, the budget ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Order!  That  should  be  ``Madam  Minister''.
Proceed, hon member.

Mr J S MABONA (Mpumalanga): Thank you, Chairperson.

Mpumalanga is one of the poorest  provinces.  We  therefore  appeal  to  all
South Africans in the private sector to come forward and help this  province
to prosper as far as the economy is concerned. This Government alone  cannot
make it possible for our communities to prosper. We  need  money,  that  the
country cannot afford, but the private sector, we believe, can afford.

Lastly, we welcome the Minister's announcement that in  the  last  financial
year 100% of the budget was spent. We would welcome it if the  Minister  and
her team would visit Mpumalanga to show us the trick.  Therefore  Mpumalanga
supports the budget. [Applause.]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon  MECs,  comrades,  let  me
start off by saying that I want to apologise for the fact that my MEC  could
not make it to this debate today owing to prior commitments that he  had  in
the province.

Since the demise of apartheid and as a consequence  of  the  dismantling  of
the Bantustans, the Department of Public Works has inherited  buildings  and
incomplete construction projects  that  were  often  referred  to  as  white
elephants. In  many  cases  these  buildings  were  either  standing  empty,
underutilised or not fully supportive of the work of the various  government
departments. Most of them were and are not conducive to access  by  disabled
people, resulting in them  being  denied  employment  opportunities  in  the
civil service.

One of the fundamental objects of the  Department  of  Public  Works  is  to
transform this legacy and  deliver  infrastructure  to  meet  the  physical,
social and economic needs of our population. Today we can proudly  say  that
the department has a turnaround strategy in place and  is  transforming  and
constructing  public  assets  for  historically  disadvantaged  communities.
Moreover, it is addressing  the  huge  infrastructural  backlogs  that  have
rendered some rural areas almost inaccessible. This has led to the  creation
of  sustainable  employment  opportunities  for  historically  disadvantaged
communities, in both rural and urban areas. It is  also  in  line  with  the
call by President Thabo Mbeki that together  we  must  expand  access  to  a
better life and push back the frontiers of poverty.

Through its Community-Based Public Works Programme, which is a vital cog  in
the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme, the  department  has
already had 11 projects running in the identified  nodal  points.  It  spent
more than R1 billion between April 1998 and  December  2000  on  the  2  219
community infrastructure projects, providing  employment  to  98  419  rural
people. In the year 2001-02 the department  succeeded  in  creating  25  124
short-term employment opportunities, with 10 627 taken by  women  alone,  10
300 by youth and 527 by people with disabilities. These figures exclude  the
contribution made by the programme to black economic empowerment, where  85%
of   all   the   contractors   participating   are   emerging   historically
disadvantaged entrepreneurs. A major social spin-off of the  Community-Based
Public  Works  Programme  is  that  it  continues  to  benefit   communities
commercially and to create sustainable  jobs.  Furthermore  the  success  of
this programme has generated a lot of expectation on the  part  of  district
municipalities and  communities  and  our  message  would  be  for  them  to
continue this  engagement.  This  has  led  to  the  department  playing  in
increasingly important role in social and local economic development.

In my province, the Northern Cape, communities have welcomed the  launch  of
the multi-purpose community centres in towns like Upington and Galeshewe  as
another pillar of delivery by the department. These centres  serve  as  one-
stop community service  centres  which  dispense  various  useful  services,
facilitating easy access to government and  social  services,  such  as  the
monthly pay-out of grants, the registration  of  births  and  marriages  and
social development.

Previously, owing to the geographic spread of  the  Northern  Cape  and  the
neglect by the former government, communities either did not have access  to
these services or had to travel long distances in order to  gain  access  to
them. These services are absolutely essential to the rural poor  and  during
our imbizo week we experienced demands for  more  such  centres,  indicating
that the concept actually addresses a very acute need.

We also welcome the same concept being  applied  to  the  area  of  criminal
justice, health, welfare and sport and recreation as well as arts,  culture,
science and technology, where community safety  centres  are  provided.  One
such community safety centre is currently under construction in the town  of
Galeshewe in the Northern Cape at a cost of R28 500 000. A  further  project
is in planning at a town near Augrabies.

When we visited our  provinces  during  the  provincial  week,  we  had  the
opportunity to visit the  urban  renewal  project  in  Galeshewe,  where  we
noticed that there was a street  paving  project  under  way  which  created
about 120 jobs for our community as well  as  an  ongoing  cleaning  project
which created approximately 80 jobs.

Today I am glad to report that we also visited our  provincial  legislature.
Building  work  is  ongoing  and  is  nearing  completion  and   there   are
approximately 800 people working on this particular project. In my  hometown
we have a brand new police station and a new magistrates' building  that  is
almost completed. We want to thank  the  Minister  for  her  efforts  in  my
constituency.

We also commend the Minister and her department for introducing  the  repair
and maintenance programme to  address  all  these  backlogs.  This  is  most
welcome since we all find ourselves at one time  or  another  in  government
buildings that serve as stark reminders of the previous era.  The  interiors
of some of these buildings do not inspire confidence  and  often  one  feels
lost and uncomfortable in them, whilst others are showing serious  signs  of
decay.

In conclusion, we have no doubt that the hon the Minister and her  committed
officials are making, and will continue to make,  a  major  contribution  in
the fight against, and  alleviation  of,  poverty.  We  thank  the  hon  the
Minister. [Applause.]

Mr C CHABANE  (Northern  Province):  Chairperson,  we  are  in  a  state  of
transition from Northern Province to Limpopo ... [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE COUNCIL: And only we will confirm that transition.

Mr C CHABANE: But we are in still in the process of transition. We have  not
reached it yet.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE COUNCIL: Order! Could  we  ask  the  delegation  from
KwaZulu-Natal for its assistance? We are hearing a great deal of  discussion
from that direction. Proceed, hon member.

Mr C CHABANE: Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy Minister,  MECs,  members
of the NCOP, given the fact that the business of this House,  amongst  other
things, is to ensure co-ordinated and proper intergovernmental relations,  I
would like to thank the Minister for her  efforts  to  ensure  co-ordination
between the national and provincial departments of public works.

From the perspective of a rural province with huge inherited  infrastructure
backlogs,  I  would  like  to  make  a  contribution   on   the   issue   of
infrastructure  maintenance  backlogs.  It  is  a  misconception  that   the
executive and the legislature of a province like ours  willingly  choose  to
underbudget for the maintenance of public infrastructure. National  mandates
in the areas of welfare,  education,  health  and  Public  Service  salaries
determine the allocation of  almost  the  entire  provincial  budget.  After
meeting this mandate,  there  is  simply  not  enough  money  left  for  the
maintenance of infrastructure.

The introduction of the infrastructure grant by the  national  Treasury  has
improved  the  situation  greatly.   However,   the   infrastructure   grant
allocations in the MTEF are not sufficient to meet the  current  maintenance
requirements, let alone to start attacking the maintenance  backlogs  or  to
make significant inroads into the  backlogs  of  a  capital  nature.  Hence,
despite the existence of the infrastructure grant, our maintenance  backlogs
continue to grow. National Treasury has indicated that provinces should  try
to merge the infrastructure grant allocations, rand for rand. However,  this
has not been possible in our  province.  On  the  contrary,  the  increasing
pressure on the provincial budget  resulting  from  welfare  commitments  is
actually resulting in a real decrease in the allocation  for  infrastructure
from the provincial equitable share in the MTEF.

Lack of capacity to spend is not the reason for insufficient expenditure  on
maintenance  in  our  province.  We  have  been  fully  spending   all   our
infrastructure grant allocations without having to roll over any  funds.  We
have also  fully  spent  all  our  flood  reconstruction  funds  within  the
allocated timeframes. Furthermore, the CSIR carried  out  an  audit  of  our
expenditure on the reconstruction of flood-damaged  roads  and  bridges  and
found that the money was spent efficiently and effectively.

In short, the shortage of money is the reason for  the  growing  maintenance
backlogs in our province. It is  also  preventing  us  from  addressing  our
infrastructure backlogs of a capital  nature  at  a  more  rapid  pace.  For
example, we have a backlog of about 900 km of provincial roads which  should
be tarred. We need to tar these roads because their traffic volumes  are  so
high that it is more expensive in the long term to maintain them  as  gravel
roads than to tar them and then maintain them as tarred roads. We need  R1,5
billion to address this particular infrastructure need alone. However,  this
financial year we were able to budget only R60 million to tar  approximately
40 km of roads. Based on the MTEF figures from the provincial  treasury,  we
will not be able to budget at all for tarring roads in  the  next  financial
year.

In this highly constrained financial environment, it is difficult for us  to
make a meaningful  infrastructural  contribution  to  the  Integrated  Rural
Development Strategy. We cannot focus all our scarce resources  on  our  two
rural developmental nodes as this will result in the rapid deterioration  of
infrastructure elsewhere in the province where there are  also  high  levels
of  poverty.  Additional  funding  is  required  for  the   development   of
infrastructure in the nodes.

As far as the Community-Based Public Works Programme is concerned,  I  think
our main challenge is to find a way of providing ongoing support to  income-
generating projects after they have been established with funding  from  the
programme.  Some  of  the  projects  in   the   Northern   Province   became
dysfunctional some time after being established. We need to find  a  way  of
ensuring that projects remain sustainable as far as possible.  Secondly,  it
is very important to ensure that we capacitate municipalities  and  district
councils that are implementing agents for  this  programme  to  be  able  to
manage it properly.

I would also like to commend  and  support  the  MEC  from  Mpumalanga  with
regard to the problems encountered with the Preferential Procurement  Policy
Act. In our assessment and experience so far, it is becoming clear  that  if
we move at the current pace and implement the Act as  it  is,  five  to  ten
years from  now  we  will  not  have  what  we  would  call  affirmed  black
contractors for several reasons. The Act is good, short and  to  the  point.
It is able to give very clear direction as to what to do when we  deal  with
procurement, but the manner in which it is structured creates  a  constraint
which will make it impossible for emerging contractors to succeed.  We  have
therefore, as a department, requested the national Minister  to  look  again
at some sections of that Act, and I hope we will be able to come  back  here
to ask for guidance.

Finally, I would like to congratulate the Minister on the  establishment  of
the Construction Industry Development Board. We  will  be  participating  in
the stakeholders' forum linked to the CIDB. We are currently in the  process
of  training  emerging  contractors  in  labour-based  road  maintenance  in
partnership with the government of Lesotho, and we look forward  to  sharing
our construction industry  development  experiences  with  our  stakeholders
through the CIDB. We hope that the work of the CIDB will help  address  some
of the problems faced by us and the construction industry in our province.

We believe that the register of contractors described in the CIDB  Act  will
assist us to improve our management of the procurement of services from  the
construction industry. We are also hopeful  that  the  CIDB  will  create  a
better  enabling  environment  for  black  economic   empowerment   in   the
construction industry.

The hon the Minister would note that in terms of the other  nine  languages,
the Department of Public Works is easily  mistaken  for  the  Department  of
Labour  or  a  department  of  employment.  But  in  actual  fact  what  the
Department of Public  Works  is  doing  is  basically  the  maintenance  and
management of state assets, not the creation of  jobs.  If  we  want  to  do
that, a higher budget will have to be allocated.
Mr O G MADODA (North West): Chairperson, hon  Minister  Sigcau,  hon  Deputy
Minister, hon members, the Budget Vote before us here today represents  both
progress and hope  for  all  of  us.  It  represents  progress  because  the
collective success that we have been able to  record  over  the  past  eight
years,  in  the  face  of  backlogs  and  constrained   budgets,   is   very
encouraging. There have also been milestones  that  have  been  achieved  in
critical areas, as the Minister has said today. Budget  underexpenditure  is
a thing of the past. Spending close on  100%  of  the  budget  in  the  past
financial year is no mean achievement and should be maintained that way.

In the same vein, the maintenance of  state  property  has  been  a  painful
thing to all of us. We have watched the deterioration, in many respects,  of
state properties, because of a lack of upkeep. Today we are encouraged  that
the Minister has mentioned that they  now  have  a  repair  and  maintenance
programme that will ensure that we do have this maintenance. Again,  we  are
encouraged by the new standard lease agreements that have  been  introduced,
so that the landlords do not abuse the discretionary and ad  hoc  agreements
that they make with government officials.

What  we  appreciate  most   are   two   things:   firstly,   the   economic
transformation that is going on. We have heard members from other  provinces
mentioning the limitations of the procurement policies, but, to  the  extent
that we have been able to bring a significant number  of  black  people  and
women into the mainstream of the economy as we have,  it  is  quite  a  good
thing. We believe that this  will  contribute  positively  to  socioeconomic
development, but also, it will bring political stability as  more  and  more
of our people see themselves as part of the new order.

We  therefore  wish  to  join  with  other  provinces  in  encouraging   the
department to continue to strengthen these efforts. The banks should  really
give black people and women access to finance  and  suppliers  of  materials
should help this process. We also appreciate the delivery that is going  on.
The  Community-Based  Public  Works  Programme  is  delivering   classrooms,
clinics, roads and multipurpose centres in many  rural  areas  and,  in  the
process, jobs are, of course, being created. We could go  on  and  on  about
these positive developments.

In the North West, for example, the provincial  legislature  has  adopted  a
programme called Adopt a School. Through this programme, each member of  the
legislature adopts a school and looks after it. Now, about two months  back,
one member of the legislature, the  hon  Masilo,  went  to  adopt  a  school
called Tshepo, in Garankuwa. We found that school  in  a  dilapidated  state
and it was very old. Today, as a result of this  Adopt  a  School  campaign,
the businesses in the area have been able to donate material,  professionals
are bringing skills and parents are bringing their  labour.  The  department
of public works is only assisting here and there and we  hope  that  in  due
course that school will be back in its original condition. We  also  believe
that if people come together in that manner, we will not  see  the  kind  of
vandalism that has been going on in schools, because  they  have  their  own
local equity in that building.
There are just a few things that we want to mention from  our  side  as  the
province. Firstly, there  appears  to  be  a  need  for  more  co-ordination
between the department, the provincial departments  and  municipalities.  In
the North West province, for example,  the  provincial  department  believes
that with regard to the Community-Based Public Works  Programme,  the  funds
that are now going directly to municipalities  are  not  getting  value  for
money because there is a lack of capacity and it seems as  if  they  do  not
have enough say in those projects.  Therefore,  there  should  be  more  co-
ordination between all these three levels.

We also wish to stress the importance of having to inculcate  responsibility
among communities, especially through local leaders,  to  prevent  abuse  of
state property. Sometimes the levels of theft and vandalism in  schools  and
other state properties are painful. It becomes clear at such times that  the
repairing and maintaining of these buildings would be counterproductive.  It
is therefore important that these values and goals that we have of  Letsima,
Vukuzenzele and the moral renewal campaign should include  the  things  that
talk about respect for our properties.

The North West legislature has had the privilege  to  receive  the  national
Portfolio Committee on Public Works, and together we visited  four  military
bases. None of these bases are used by  the  military  any  longer  and  are
therefore being handed back to the Department of  Public  Works.  The  theft
and vandalism that we saw there is very high. In one area, at a base  called
Buxton, in Taung, we found that geysers, fridges and stoves were  all  being
gutted, and it is a fairly new base. When we spoke  to  the  local  council,
they told us that they had repeatedly written letters to the  department  of
public works in the province  to  request  them  to  find  a  use  for  that
building but to no avail.

We therefore believe that the public partnerships that could  arise  out  of
that could save that property. With regard to the  ISRDP,  members  of  this
NCOP last week visited our province, and together with them  we  went  to  a
cross-border district called Kgalagadi. The council and the community  there
took us round, showing  us  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development
Programme. Now, Kgalagadi is one of those nodes that  have  been  identified
nationally, and last year around  this  time,  the  President  launched  the
ISRDP there. Here we found that there is  good  progress  in  projects  that
amount to just under R1 billion. We saw the fruits of this programme in  the
public infrastructure that is now coming up. There is a  lot  of  enthusiasm
on local economic development and numerous projects were shown to us.

All state departments are taking part and the continued support of both  the
provincial and national departments of public works  is  appreciated.  There
are also good public-private partnerships in that  programme.  For  example,
Eskom is working with the council to bring lights  to  that  area,  but  the
kind of light that they are bringing is not the  usual  one  that  we  know.
These lights are somehow cheaper and use cleaner technology.

In conclusion, we from the North West want to see the department  spared  to
keep on doing a good job and we support this Vote. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I hope that Dr Radebe  is  going  to  introduce
some energy. I understand that members are feeling very hot and  tired  this
afternoon.

Dr B M RADEBE (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  I  think  I  should  start  by
launching a protest. The microphones need to be raised for some  of  us  who
may not be of normal size. [Laughter.] I  would  like  to  congratulate  the
national Minister and her deputy on  the  improvement  in  service  delivery
throughout the country, in particular in our province.

Having said that, I would like to emphasise that  KwaZulu-Natal  is  one  of
the largest provinces in South Africa. We also have the  largest  population
and the largest area that is underdeveloped.  We  are  pleased  to  announce
that the KwaZulu-Natal district councils have been  allocated  approximately
R74 million.

The Community-Based Public Works Programme, CBPWP, is a poverty  relief  and
transformation programme. It has a role  in  transforming  the  construction
industry, with respect to labour-intensive construction, poverty relief  and
integrated rural planning.

The  programme  is  targeted  at  rural   areas   where   normal   municipal
infrastructure investments are not made. The CBPWP utilises  a  transparent,
equitable, poverty-targeting formula and promotes  financial  accountability
at the local government level.  The  targeting  formula  promotes  financial
accountability at local level.

An amount is allocated to each municipality  in  terms  of  the  transparent
targeting formula. On the basis of this allocation,  the  municipality  then
identifies appropriate projects within the allocation amount. The  targeting
formula, informed by the October household survey and census  data,  focuses
on population and poverty indices in order to ensure  that  allocations  are
appropriately utilised.  We  stress  the  importance  of,  and  commend  the
national Department of Public Works for  setting  aside  money  to  conduct,
proper planning. This has boosted the provincial  co-ordinating  committee's
ability to identify and approve only projects that are viable.

With regard to emerging contractors I want  to  concur  with  the  MECs  for
Mpumalanga and the Northern Province. I think the national Government  needs
to do something about these contractors. On 15 May 2002 we  were  approached
by emerging contractors  at  Ladysmith  in  the  Tugela  region.  The  major
complaint  was  that  they  were  still  not  getting  benefits  from  these
contractors. They are abused by those big companies with whom they  have  to
compete. We want to appeal to the Minister to see to it that these  emerging
contractors are not abused.

The portfolio committee in KwaZulu-Natal conducted visits from 15 to 22  May
2002  to  all  11  district  municipalities  where  we  inspected   projects
initiated by the department of public works. We  were  happy  with  all  the
projects, except a few where there was no proper communication  between  the
provincial department and the national and local governments.  It  sometimes
creates a problem when we see a huge project has been launched,  but  nobody
in the province knows about that project. On a number of occasions  we  have
seen project launches on television or heard about them  on  radio  for  the
first time. The launches at Port Shepstone, Nongoma and Ngwavuma are  a  few
of the recent project launches that the portfolio  committee  was  not  even
aware of. We find that this lack  of  communication  between  the  national,
provincial and local government structures needs to be corrected.

We feel that  it  is  important  to  strengthen  the  relationship  and  the
communication between the three  spheres  of  government.  We  call  on  the
Government to play a bigger role in an effort to co-ordinate  this  project.
This is of  paramount  importance  as  it  will  ensure  that  communication
between the three portfolio committees and the province improves.

The committee and the province feel that we  have  to  be  involved  in  the
earlier stages of budget planning of the department. This can only  lead  to
positive outcomes as it will avoid duplication of  work  and  the  sense  of
confrontation.

In conclusion, I would like to stress that KwaZulu-Natal cannot  survive  on
the current allocations. We urge the Minister  to  increase  our  budget  in
order for us to be able to deal with poverty and the poorest  of  the  poor,
in order for them to receive development.

I have noticed that the national Minister for Agriculture and  Land  Affairs
is here. Ngithi-ke kumkhaya wami ngizosho ekhaya ukuthi ngimbonile.  [To  my
home-fellow, I would like to say that I would tell people  at  home  that  I
have seen him.]

I think as a province we are very happy and very excited about the role  the
national Minister and her department are  playing  in  our  province.  As  I
said, we did visit a few projects of all  the  different  municipalities  in
our province. What we have discovered is that  there  are  areas  where  one
finds that there is a huge project of R3 million, but it  is  in  isolation,
because there was  no  proper  communication  between  the  three  tiers  of
government, for example the one at Majuba, where we went on 16 May. It is  a
R3,5 million project. In order for the public to  use  that  facility,  they
need to catch a taxi. The council just decided to  put  that  project  there
and in this case there was no proper communication between the council,  the
district council and the provincial government.

We support the budget and appeal to  our  Minister,  if  she  comes  to  our
province, to inform us. When we see Minister opening a project,  but  nobody
from the province is there ... [Time expired.]

Nk M XULU (KwaZulu-Natal): Sihlalo, mhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe nePhini lakhe  -
uMfu uNondaba ongumfundisi wami nabahlonishwa  bonke  abakhona,  kuyintokozo
kimina ukuba ngibe yingxenye yokuxoxa ngalesi sabelo  salo  mNyango.  Kuzoba
yinkinga-ke ukuthi siphuma ndawonye, sikhuluma izinto ezifanayo  kodwa  sibe
singahleli ndawonye. Kodwa-ke  ayikho  into  engenzeka  ngoba  kusho  ukuthi
kuyasetshenzwa KwaZulu.

Kulo nyaka  ophelile  saba  nenhlanhla  yokuba  kufike  amalungu  asezingeni
likazwelonke ekomidi lalo mNyango. Ayeholwa umhlonishwa iNkosi  uMashasha  -
iNkosi uHlengwa. Sahambela  izindawo  ezehlukene  safike  sabona  imisebenzi
eminingi futhi emikhulu ezindaweni ezehlukene,  njengesibhedlela  esilaphaya
eThekwini ogama laso kuthiwa yiNkosi Albert Luthuli.  Sabona  futhi  nendawo
yokuphumula elaphaya eMpangeni, e-Port Dunford, ekade ivulwa nje zolo  lokhu
ngabahlonishwa oNgqongqoshe  behamba  bobabili,  bebambisene  futhi  kukuhle
kudelile.

Okwaba kuhle kwaba ukubona abahlonishwa bebambisene  emazingeni  womathathu:
elikazwelonke - umhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe uSigcau, umhlonishwa  iPhini  lakhe
-  umfundisi;  umhlonishwa  uNyambose  ophethe  umNyango   waKwaZulu-Natali;
nomhlonishwa  imeya  yesifunda  -  uNyambose.  Mhlawumbe  ngephutha  kuthiwa
bathathu kanti bane.  Lokho  kunika  abantu  ithemba  uma  bebona  uHulumeni
edilika, ehlangane nabanye, eza phansi kubo emazingeni aphansi.

Into embi nje ukuthi isikhathi esisinikwayo  sincane.  Ngibhale  le  nkulumo
yami  ngazi  ukuthi  mithathu  imizuzu  engiyinikiwe.  Nokho-ke,  ngiyabonga
ukuthi ibuye yathi ukwengezwa kancane.

Sengathi lesi sabelo  singaya  kulezo  zindawo  ikakhulukazi  ezasala  emuva
kakhulu ngenxa kahulumeni owayengabanakile  abantu  abantulayo.  Siyathokoza
ukuzwa ukuthi isabelo sethu siyilelo  nani  amalungu  abelisho,  okuyizigidi
zamarandi ezingu-70.

Sengathi  zingafezeka  izinjongo  ezibhalwe  kuleli   phepha   lesabiwomali,
ikakhulukazi mayelana  nokufundisa  imisebenzi  labo  abekade  becindezelwe.
Leyo  yimisebenzi   engaze   ibenze   babe   ngosonkontileka.   Abesifazane,
ikakhulukazi, yibona  okumele  basizwe  ngoba  yibona  ababhekene  nobunzima
bokondla imindeni. Yibona ababhekene nesimo esinzima emindenini lapho  isala
nezintandane ngenxa  yesifo  esikhona.  Yibona  ababhekena  namakhaya  lapho
obaba  besathathwe  yizipawupethe.  Ngakho-ke,  kumele  kwazeke  ukuthi  uma
umuntu ethuthukisa oyedwa wesifazane, usuke esiza isizwe.

Siyawubonga  umNyango  wezemiSebenzi  laphaya  kithi  KwaZulu-Natali   ngoba
usuqale nokufundisa abantu  abakade  bengakwazi  ukuzibhalela  nokuzifundela
kanye nokuzivulela izinkontileka zabo. Nokho-ke kusesekuseni - kusho  ukuthi
kothi kuba ntambama kobe sekubonakala ukuthi ukhona umsebenzi owenziwayo.

Ngabe ngenze kabi uma ngingabonganga nakuhulumeni wakithi  omdala  waKwaZulu
ngoba nguye owakha ezinye zezinto ezaba  khona,  ezakha  ngezimali  ezincane
ababenikwa zona. Waze wakha  ngisho  naleliya  phalamende  laKwaZulu-Natali,
okuyilona umuntu ezwa kukhulunywa ngalo futhi eselizosala libe  yile  ndlovu
emhlophe okuhlala  kukhulunywa  ngayo.  Zizothuthuka  kanjani  lezi  zakhiwo
ezishiywayo  thina  mphakathi  esazidonsela  ngezithukuthuku   zethu   futhi
esakhipha emaphakatheni ethu ngazo? Ngiyadlula lapho, bengisika elijikayo.
Sengathi  umNyango  ungaqhubeka  nokwakha  izizinda  zemisebenzi   eziqoqela
ndawonye ezibizwa ngama-clusters  ezindaweni  zasemakhaya  ukuze  kusizakale
labo   abahamba   amabanga   amade   uma   beyofuna   izinto   abazidingayo,
njengokuyocela  izimpesheni  nokufuna  izitifiketi.   Kungaba   ngcono   uma
izakhiwo   zonke   zizokwakhiwa   zibe   ndawonye   ngoba   abanye   bahamba
amakhilomitha angaphezu kwama-50 behambela nje ukuyofuna  impesheni.  Umuntu
afike laphaya kuthiwe akobuya ngosuku olulandelayo. Sekuyofuneka  futhi  aye
koboleka imali ukuze aphindele futhi aye kofuna leyo mpesheni. Uma  kwakhiwe
eduze kwabo abantu, kulethwa kubo, bazokwazi ukuthi basizakale.

Sengathi  ikakhulukazi  uma  sekwenziwa  konke  lokhu  kungaqalwa   ngakithi
laphaya  eNsabekhuluma  ngoba  phela  ngizalwa  khona.  Bathi  nabakholwayo,
oNondaba, uma umuntu ebona  uthi  esweni  lomunye,  umuntu  akosusa  olwakhe
kuqala. Umuntu makasuse uthi esweni lakhe ukuze akwazi ukubona  elomfowethu.
Akuqalwe kithi-ke manje uma kwakhiwa lezo zizinda eziqoqela  ndawonye  ukuze
abantu babone ukuthi sikhona ePhalamende, siyabasiza.

Okokugcina, thina KwaZulu-Natali siyasesekela lesi sabiwomali. [Ihlombe.]

USIHLALO  WOMKHANDLU  KAZWELONKE  WEZIFUNDAZWE:  Thulani!  Ngibonga  kakhulu
mhlonishwa ngoba usincedile. Ubavusile abantu bethu.  (Translation  of  Zulu
speech follows.)

[Mrs M XULU: Chairperson, hon Minister and  her  deputy,  Rev  Nondaba,  and
other hon members who are in this House, it is my pleasure to take  part  in
the budget debate of this department. It would be a problem if  we  did  not
plan together while coming from the same place and speaking about  the  same
things. However, nothing can be done,  because  it  means  that  people  are
working in KwaZulu-Natal.

Last year we were fortunate to be  visited  by  members  from  the  national
Government who are members of the committee of this  department.  They  were
led by inkosi Mashasha - inkosi Hlengwa. We visited many places and  we  saw
many big projects in different places, like a hospital in Durban,  which  is
known as the iNkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital. We also saw  a  holiday  resort
in Mpangeni, Port  Dunford,  which  was  opened  recently  by  the  two  hon
Ministers. They were together in this and it was a good thing indeed.

What was really  good  was  to  see  Ministers  from  all  three  levels  of
government working together - that was hon Minister Sigcau and  her  Deputy,
Rev Nyambose, who is the provincial minister in KwaZulu-Natal, and  the  hon
mayor of the region, Nyambose. Perhaps it is wrong to say  that  there  were
three, as in fact they were four. It gives people hope to see  the  national
Government coming to join with others at the lower levels.

The bad thing is that the time we are given is  very  short.  When  I  wrote
this speech, I knew that I had only three minutes. However,  I  am  thankful
for the fact that my time has been extended a little bit.

We wish that this budget would go to those  places  that  were  left  behind
because of the government who ignored poor people.  We  are  happy  to  hear
that our budget is the amount that  members  had  mentioned,  which  is  R70
million.

We wish that the goals that are listed in the  budget  would  be  fulfilled,
especially regarding the passing on of skills to those who  were  previously
oppressed. Those jobs could turn them into contractors.  Women are the  ones
to be assisted, because they are faced with the challenge of  feeding  their
families. They are the ones who are faced with difficult situations  in  the
families where they are left with orphans because of  the  present  disease.
They are the ones who are left with  families  when  beautiful  ladies  take
fathers away. Therefore, it should be known that if one  empowers  a  woman,
one is empowering the nation.

We thank the department of public works in  KwaZulu-Natal  for  starting  to
teach illiterate people and  people  who  were  unable  to  open  their  own
contracting businesses. Now it is morning. When the afternoon comes it  will
be clear that some work has been done.

I would be making a mistake if  I  did  not  thank  our  old  government  in
KwaZulu-Natal for building some of the things that we have. It  built  those
things with the little money that it was given. It even built Parliament  in
KwaZulu-Natal, which we always hear about and which will be left alone.  How
are those buildings that we as a community built going to be improved if  we
leave them, while we built them with our own sweat and even paid  for  them?
Let me move on, I just mentioned that point in passing.

We wish the department to continue to provide cluster infrastructure in  the
rural areas so as to help those who travel long distances  to  get  to  what
they want, like applying for a  pension  and  asking  for  certificates.  It
would be better if all infrastructure is built in one  place,  because  some
people have to travel more than 50 km to apply for a pension. When a  person
gets there he is told to come tomorrow. Then he has to borrow some money  so
that he can go to apply for a pension again. If these things  are  built  in
one place and closer to the people, they could be helped easily.

I wish that when the time comes to initiate these  programmes,  they  should
also be initiated in my area, Nsabekhuluma, where I was born.  Even  as  the
Christians, like Nondaba, say: ``When you see a mote in someone else's  eye,
first take the beam out of your own eye.'' One must take  the  beam  out  of
his eyes so that he would be able to  see  the  motes  in  the  eye  of  his
brother. That cluster infrastructure should be started in our areas so  that
people can see that we are in Parliament, and that we are helping them.

Lastly, we in KwaZulu-Natal support this budget. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Thank you very much for your  help.  You
woke our people up.]

Ms T ESSOP (Western Cape): Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister
and hon members of the House, I recently took over the portfolio  of  public
works as part of the transport and public works  portfolio  in  the  Western
Cape. I had the good fortune of meeting with the Minister recently  and  she
was surprised to see another new MEC from the Western  Cape.  [Laughter.]  I
am hoping that we will finally have stability in the Western  Cape.  We  are
looking forward to stability in the Western Cape, and I am sure hon  members
are all watching the news keenly to see this happen.

I am pleased to say and announce in this  House  that  I  believe  there  is
stability in the Western Cape Cabinet around one very important  matter  and
that is that our focus and bias  should  be  on  towards  the  poor  in  the
Western Cape. That remains a clear objective in  the  Western  Cape  and  we
remain committed in our Cabinet to that particular  aspect.  The  Department
of Public Works has  a  very  important  role  to  play  in  terms  of  that
objective. We both have the power to deliver in  terms  of  social  delivery
and in terms of economic empowerment.

I believe we have an opportunity to deliver both socially  and  economically
with the Western Cape budget of R197 million for maintenance  and  upgrading
of our buildings, plus an additional amount of R141 million  which  will  be
allocated to the construction of new projects. The increase of  R85  million
that we have towards infrastructure will provide us with  a  very  important
opportunity to deliver.

However, I do want to indicate, like many of the  provinces  here,  that  we
still have a backlog in maintenance of R1,2 billion, and we are  looking  at
exciting ways of trying  to  address  that  backlog  through  new  means  of
funding.

There are two opportunities that we are very  clear  about  in  the  Western
Cape branch of public works and they are job creation  and  the  empowerment
of previously disadvantaged businesses. In the Western  Cape,  specifically,
we have a backlog to address. I want to be honest and frank  about  this  in
that we have a backlog of almost seven to eight years in  the  Western  Cape
when it comes to the empowerment of PDI companies.

PDI companies are looking forward to a new regime and a  new  way  of  doing
things. This public works branch of  my  department  is  very  committed  to
ensuring that  we  address  the  backlog  when  it  comes  to  emerging  PDI
contractors. In that process, I have now put in  place  two  units,  a  unit
that will be looking at unbundling our  contract  so  that  we  can  empower
small contractors and a second unit that will look  at  the  monitoring  and
evaluation of the empowerment of previously  disadvantaged  individuals  and
companies. Although we have policies in place, it is in  the  implementation
that  we  are  not  actually  reaching  the  ground  in  relation   to   PDI
empowerment.

Over and above that, I am proud to say that the ABE -  affirmative  business
enterprise  -  contractor  development  and  support  programme  covers  our
building of roads, and will now also include public works and  the  work  we
do in public works programmes. We cannot allow PDIs to  become  disempowered
by not building their capacity.

I had an example recently in my  own  department  when  offices  were  being
painted. The department  understood  that  I  was  very  serious  about  the
empowerment of PDIs and managed to secure a small  African  contractor.  The
one thing that was missing was that  my  department  did  not  look  at  the
capacity and building the capacity of that small individual  businessperson.
Therefore, for example, the contractor did not have a ladder. They  employed
two people who did not have money for public transport to come  to  work  to
be able to do this job and who had to take out  loans  in  the  township  so
that they too could come to work and be empowered.

It is that missing perspective in the department  that  we  need  to  ensure
changes in the Western Cape. We will look at how to build  the  capacity  of
our smaller contractors - the  people  who  are  taking  the  initiative  to
create an opportunity. When they are given the opportunity, we need  to  see
that the capacity is there for  them  to  become  empowered  and  eventually
become stronger, bigger businesses.

The PDI companies must not remain subcontractors  forever.  We  are  hoping,
through this  programme,  that  we  will  support  that,  and  I  know  that
nationally all of this has been done; the Western Cape needs to play  catch-
up.
I want to talk  about  the  Community-Based  Public  Works  Programme.  This
programme did not exist when I took  over  this  portfolio  in  the  Western
Cape. I believe 1996 was  the  last  time  that  we  had  funding  from  the
national Public Works Department for such a programme. Since  then  we  have
had no funding, but the programme also does not exist.

We have, however, got a community access road programme,  which  is  similar
to the Community-Based Public Works Programme,  and  we  also  have  poverty
alleviation projects, funded by Sandral, as part of those projects. I  heard
that when the hon the Minister listed allocations to provinces, the  Western
Cape was not included. I understand and I accept that  nationally  the  need
for funding to address poverty is a big one, but I think  we  also  need  to
understand, in this House specifically  -  and  I  have  said  this  in  the
transport budget debate - that in the Western Cape we also have poverty.  We
have very serious pockets of poverty in the Western Cape. Maybe there  is  a
sense nationally that because we are far  more  advantaged  in  the  Western
Cape, we do not need it.
We should not miss the reality  that  there  are  very  serious  pockets  of
poverty. Our national President has  indicated  two  nodes  in  the  Western
Cape, an urban node and a rural  node,  the  Central  Karoo.  We  have  very
exciting projects in the Central Karoo  that  fit  in  with  the  Integrated
Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme,  but  those  are   roads-related
projects. We are funding it out of our roads budget. I am appealing  to  the
Minister. I understand that the budget has  been  reduced,  but  I  ask  the
Minister if there is still an  opportunity  to  be  able  to  give  us  some
allocation. I have asked my department to put  in  R3  million  from  Public
Works, as a sign of good faith that we are  putting  Community-Based  Public
Works Programmes back on the agenda in the Western Cape.

It will be highly appreciated and I appeal to the Minister, if it  is  still
possible for her to look at an allocation, albeit a small  one,  as  a  sign
that we can work together, co-operatively,  on  the  Community-based  Public
Works Programme in the Western Cape.

The other element of my portfolio is that  of  property  management,  and  I
want to  say  that,  when  taking  over  this  portfolio,  I  instructed  my
department to take a conservative approach  to  the  disposal  of  land  and
property. I believe we could have inadvertently been selling off the  family
silver. I have inherited a portfolio where  I  believe  that  we  have  been
selling off our family silver.

Disposal of property and land is now ... We could  say  there  is  now  some
kind of moratorium on it. We will now be  disposing  of  property  and  land
when we have a proper strategic understanding of what we want to  do  there.
The bias towards ensuring that our land and our property are  used  for  the
development  of  our  previously  disadvantaged  community,   for   low-cost
housing, for meeting the social delivery needs, is  going  to  be  extremely
important on this agenda.

Also, I do want to say to the hon the Minister that we have  land  in  areas
where previously disadvantaged communities have never had access,  and  will
probably not be able to afford to  have  access  to.  I  am  very  seriously
looking at how we use those important pieces of land to redress  our  legacy
of the past, and allow our previously disadvantaged communities to  have  an
opportunity to live in areas that were  not  available  for  access  in  the
past. So we do have a strong bias. I want to say in this  House  today  that
we are extremely committed to undoing the legacy of the past,  and  also  to
undoing the backlog that we face in the Western Cape.

We are firmly back in the new South Africa. The Western Cape has come  home,
and I want to put that message across in this House. [Applause.]  If  we  do
not have our own Western Cape members howling against their MEC!

I just want to conclude. I am personally committed to working with  the  hon
the Minister in a co-operative  and  healthy  relationship  to  address  the
broader objectives that we face in this country. I am pleased to  say  that,
as I said, we have come home, and I am looking forward to working  with  her
in that co-operative manner.  The  hon  the  Minister's  experience  of  the
Western Cape might have been different, but I want to put on record that  it
is going to change, and has changed. We support the budget. [Applause.]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, hon Minister, Deputy Minister, MECs present  here,
special delegates and hon members, the projects which have been  implemented
by the department are based on five broad categories which include  improved
access to trade opportunities. This category will  enhance  the  rural  road
network so as to improve  access  and  facilitate  community  markets.  This
category  is  directly  productive.  These  projects  will  provide  ongoing
sustainable  employment,  such  as  agricultural  food  slots,   small-scale
irrigation, recycling waste collection, and stop dams.

We in the ANC support the Vote. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS:  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  members,  MECs  and
members of the police who are present here, I must thank everybody  for  the
contribution they have made, because even in those areas where  people  were
raising issues of concern, they also came up with solutions. It  has  always
been my belief that we have to be constructive in  our  criticism.  I  thank
members for that. Also, if members did not raise some of  these  issues,  we
would blindly think that everything at home was  fine,  only  to  find  that
here and there we still have areas which we needed to cover.

I will not reply to individuals, but I will look at areas which  cropped  up
every now and again. One of the very first speakers spoke  about  the  issue
of leases. I want to assure the hon member, I think it is Mr Raju,  that  we
have done a lot of homework. We  have  actually  renegotiated  a  number  of
these leases to suit our ends, and in Public Works we  can  no  longer  talk
about rentals which are paid even beyond the  period  of  the  contract.  We
have even taken issues a step further by making sure that what we  lease  is
of good quality, and that some of the repairs which  unfortunately  we  used
to carry, are actually the repairs which must be  carried  by  the  landlord
himself, because it is his property that we are leasing.

Also, with regard to the buildings that are no longer  in  use,  I  want  to
assure members that we do  not  simply  sell  as  if  it  is  one  of  those
disposals which do not take into account  the  needs  of  the  country.  Our
policy is that before a property can be  disposed  of  we  must  check  that
there is no provincial local interest in the property and no future use  for
such a property even at the level of national Government. Then  we  have  to
dispose of that property. In the final analysis, if we sit on some of  these
properties, the Government is going to lose a lot of money because  we  have
to pay rates and taxes, and we have to minimise  that  type  of  expenditure
for the Government. It does not mean that maybe here and there  mistakes  of
judgment are not made, but we are trying to really refine our procedures  so
that we do not make such mistakes.

There was also talk of Public Works as  a  job  creator.  We  are  currently
answering to one of the issues that was  raised  by  the  President  in  his
speech. He actually,  in  my  interpretation,  really  wanted  to  hear  the
crunching of the stones, the  hammer  working,  the  shovels  moving,  in  a
massive Public Works Programme, which would employ a lot of people.

We are working on something which we still have to discuss  further  with  a
number of stakeholders, for we want to  believe  that  certain  things  will
have to be agreed on upfront. If  we  want  to  employ  as  many  people  as
possible, we cannot afford to have communities who will say, on  a  standard
wage we shall create, and that we should pay more,  because  it  will  still
take us back to a situation where we would have to employ a few  specialised
people.

We are working towards a situation in which we shall use  machinery  if  and
when it is necessary to do so but, broadly speaking, we shall  use  as  much
manual labour as possible. I know  that  the  very  people  who  are  saying
today, ``Let us have more jobs,'' will come back to this House,  if  a  road
takes 12 months as  against  the  nine  months  it  would  have  taken  with
machinery, and say we are slow. Hence I am saying,  in  talking  about  this
broad strategy of development, that we have to understand one  another  very
well and come to some agreement, because it is one of those  strategies  and
one of those innovations we have to work at together.

There is a backlog - that is a fact - but through  some  of  the  strategies
which I mentioned in my speech we are trying,  both  at  the  level  of  the
national Government and at that of the provinces, to make a  difference.  Of
course the broader difference can be made by what the financial  package  is
each time that we move on these issues. We have also started on  a  strategy
which is  helpful  to  us  as  Public  Works,  in  that  it  is  the  client
departments that must say what it is that they want to do with their  budget
that particular year.

There was a member who was talking about police stations in a  certain  area
- I think it must have been in the Western Province and I want to  encourage
that particular colleague to go to the department of police  and  tell  them
what the problem is. They will prioritise and then our  department,  as  the
implementing agent, will deal with the issue. We have stopped keeping  money
for other departments. They keep it themselves, they tell us what to do  and
then we act on their needs.

I am happy that it looks  like  everything  is  working  very  well  in  the
Northern Cape. We  are  looking  forward  to  the  day  when  we  open  that
legislature, because all the land came  from  Public  Works  for  absolutely
nothing to make sure that hon members' government moved  on.  The  community
safety  centres  are  an  important  fixture.  The  same  applies   to   the
multipurpose community centres. With the  knowledge  that  we  have,  moneys
being available, we have realised that almost every district is in  need  of
these community centres.

Concerning construction, at times  I  get  jealous  of  my  colleague  here,
Thoko, when she has to call the farmers to the committee with the  President
or when Trade and Industry has to talk about manufacturing, because  I  feel
that construction should also be taken as an asset of  Government  to  which
we pay a lot of attention. It is through construction  that  our  plans  for
the future can be realised. We can talk of Southern Africa, we can  talk  of
Nepad, but who are going to be the builders or constructors? We are  gearing
ourselves up, through the Construction Industry Development Board and  other
fora that we are going to have, as was mentioned by the  MEC  from  Limpopo,
for changing construction into something which all hon members will  give  a
nod and regard as a national asset.

It is true that, like the rest of this House, we are also worried about  the
Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act, but  fortunately  there  have
been discussions between us and national Treasury and I am  informed  by  my
officials that there is a committee which will be looking further into  this
so that, instead of it being an obstruction, we can look at  something  that
will open up the gates for all  the  people  for  procurement  to  become  a
reality, not an obstruction.

Every time I come to this House we talk about capacity. I think a number  of
colleagues can help us if they spread the news to all the  people  in  their
constituencies  and  even  the  people  in  construction  that  there  is  a
department which is doing a lot of wonderful work in  equipping  our  people
with skills. When we start on any project which is of a building nature,  we
always take members of that community to be trained at some  of  the  skills
centres of the Department of Labour so that  they  do  not  just  turn  into
people who use the wheelbarrow and  the  spade,  but  begin  to  acquire  to
skills in various areas.

We  also  had  the  problem,  in  the  Western  Cape,   for   instance,   of
certification. We knew that there were a lot of people  who  actually  could
do work of a specific kind but were not certificated. When we had  to  count
the numbers we found that we had a paucity of such  people.  But  a  lot  of
work has been done in  different  avenues  to  make  sure  that  people  are
certificated in the true sense of the word and the Department of Labour  has
come to our help and has been on the forefront.

The question of the sustainability of projects is something we  are  working
at. Initially projects were there, but there was never capital to  kickstart
a project. How can one go to a poor  area  and  put  up  the  infrastructure
without allowing people the funds to start the project?  One  of  the  areas
that we have kickstarted is that of the community production centres, and  I
am happy that my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs  is
here because it is one of those formidable partnerships that we have  formed
which is beginning to unwind and is going to  create  dynamic  economies  in
some of our districts.

Members saw what was happening in Elandskraal. If we had  time,  they  would
see what we are going to be doing in Mpumalanga. I think if we  unroll  what
we have in the rural areas, especially in the  line  of  what  my  colleague
here deals with in agriculture, with my department providing  the  necessary
infrastructure, we can turn South Africa into  a  pantry  for  the  rest  of
Africa. Does my colleague agree with me?

We have to provide infrastructure. The Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs comes with policies and  plans.  She  comes  with  the  right  crop,
because we do not know, we might go and plant chillies where maize would  do
better. With their guidance as the Department of  Agriculture,  we  want  to
believe that we can change the whole scenario. But that  scenario  can  only
change if the mindset of our people also changes and they realise that  they
cannot get employment only in the cities,  that  the  rural  areas  too  can
provide a living for  the  people  provided  the  provinces  and  the  local
authorities   get   sufficient   funding   to   roll   out   the   necessary
infrastructure.

In my speech in the National Assembly I did mention that we are  trying  our
level best to help our previously disadvantaged people  to  access  finance.
We want to mention in particular the IDC, which has come to our  rescue,  so
that money could be made  available.  We  have  tried  to  create  jobs  and
contracts that are specifically for the previously  disadvantaged.  We  even
had money rolled out - I think it was about R128 million - specifically  for
women in construction and we have a number of other projects which  are  for
the previously disadvantaged.

If one were to go to Port Elizabeth, to St Alban's  Prison,  one  would  see
the most wonderful work which has been done  by  somebody  who  used  to  be
historically disadvantaged, but is now an entrepreneur in his own right.  If
there is one expression I will hate to  hear  five  years  from  now  it  is
``previously disadvantaged''. If we hear that word being used  in  the  near
future, then something will have gone wrong somewhere.

I do not want to waste time, and all members  agreed  with  our  speech.  In
reply to a concern about a lack of co-ordination, I want to correct the  hon
members from KwaZulu-Natal. We always inform the provinces  and  fortunately
we have an MEC for public works who is present at all our launches.

The other thing is that the implementing agents for  our  projects  are  the
district municipalities, which must see to  it  that  councillors  are  also
present. What I will correct is our  omitting  to  invite  people  from  the
NCOP, who must go to functions that  relate  to  their  provinces.  That  is
where we might have missed the  point,  but  at  the  provincial  and  local
levels we definitely have not missed the boat.  Also  I  want  to  emphasise
that when we came into Government we said we were going to have the  Basotho
hat in coming up with projects. No more were we going  to  get  a  situation
where national Government thinks of projects.

Njengokuthi nje kuthi uma ngilele ebusuku  ngiphuphe  oTshabalala  balaphaya
lapho  ngangendele  khona  bese  ngithi  cha,  ngizoya   koqala   imisebenzi
yamaprojekthi  KwaZulu,  eLadysmith.  [For  instance,  like  dreaming  about
Shabala people at night, when I am asleep. This is the clan of  my  husband,
and because they are in Ladysmith I will  say  that  I  will  go  and  start
projects in Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal.]

What we do now is actually tell local government that  they  must  say  what
their priorities are, and then discuss them with provincial  government  for
support. Then, through the integrated strategy, we say that  those  are  the
priorities  of  the  people,  because  otherwise  I  might  go  and  put  in
electricity where the people might want water as their first priority.

Asiphuphi manje. Sitshelwa  futhi  sikhonjiswe  ngamalungu  lokho  okufanele
sikwenze, bese sikwenza. Kodwa-ke uMnambithi wanginika umyeni  omuhle  futhi
engangimthanda. [We do not just dream, we are  told  and  shown  by  members
what we should do, and then we do it. But Ladysmith gave me a good  husband,
whom I love.]

Maybe some hon members do not know that I was  married  and  now  I  am  Mrs
Tshabalala. [Interjections.] Kwazulu-Natal!

There is a lot of vandalism going on, and honestly I  would  appeal  to  all
hon members to make a point of protecting  what  we  have.  In  some  cases,
despite the asset register, properties remain  hidden  and  people  are  not
keen to change that. I think the Western Cape will have to help us  a  great
deal in saying who owns what. I am saying this based on an  experience  that
I once mentioned at a media briefing. Last year we came across a  big  piece
of land, where somebody was staying. It was only  after  we  had  discovered
the land that the person was even put in a position to pay the rent.

I think I have covered some of the major issues that the  hon  members  came
up with. If there are still some concerns, the  hon  members  know  that  my
department has an open-door policy. They can write to us and  we  will  deal
with their concerns. I can assure the hon member from the Western Cape  that
we are not putting all the money into the Eastern Cape.  We  are  allocating
money according to population, poverty and performance.

I do not want to single out KwaZulu-Natal,  even  if  they  belong  to  that
party with whom we are in Government, but the truth of the  matter  is  that
if one gives them money, they deliver. We would like to see  more  of  that.
But all the provinces must try their level best, and I hope that one  day  I
can set up a competition to find the province that works the fastest on  the
delivery of poverty-related projects. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

                 LAND AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  my  colleagues
the Minister and Deputy Minister of Public Works, MECs from  the  provinces,
the chairperson of the select committee and the managing director and  staff
of the Land Bank, I want to say to my home boy  Dr  Radebe  that  indeed  he
must tell them that he saw me in the NCOP today. Further than that, the  hon
member needs to send a message to the farmers of Sankontshe and  Camperdown,
saying that because of the co-operation between them  in  the  province  and
the Government at national level, we were able to deal  with  the  foot-and-
mouth disease. Today South Africa has regained its FMD-free  status  through
the OIE. [Applause.]

I want to thank this House and Dr Radebe for the  work  that  he  has  done,
together with the members of the portfolio committee in KwaZulu-  Natal,  as
well as the MEC. They did not regard our intervention as  intrusion  by  the
national Government. They understood that  agriculture  was  a  system  that
could never be broken down into small pieces, and therefore  that  when  the
disease struck we all needed to work together to succeed.

I am grateful for  the  commitment  that  was  made  by  some  hon  members,
ensuring that they did not rest  but  help  us  persuade  the  community  to
understand that what we had to do, spraying them sometimes and going in  and
out of their villages, was necessary, not just for themselves  but  for  the
South African economy. I think it is important that we actually thank  those
people, particularly the rural community and the poor farmers  who  had  one
or two cattle in Sankotshe and had to accept  that  sometimes  they  had  to
lose the few head of livestock that they had.

Raising this issue about foot-and-mouth in part tells us  that  agricultural
development in South Africa is no more an issue about where people  go  when
they retire. Even  the  historically  disadvantaged  communities  understand
that agriculture is also vital for their economic livelihood  and  therefore
important.

In the Reconstruction and Development Programme as  a  policy  framework  of
this  Government,  amongst  other  things  that  were  identified  was   the
challenge that we needed to deal  with  in  creating  a  united,  prosperous
agricultural sector in South Africa. It acknowledged the need for  land  and
agrarian reform in our society, given the legacy of our past.

The  reason  we  are  here  today  to  debate  the  Land  and   Agricultural
Development Bank Bill is about ensuring that indeed  we  advance  issues  of
transformation that were identified in the RDP and further in  our  sectoral
policies on land and agriculture. It is also about deepening  out  democracy
and thereby creating opportunity for the participation of all our people  in
the economy of this country,

Farmers in the farming  community  are  important  people  in  our  economic
growth. They are the producers of food and fibre for our nation.  These  are
the people  who  today  will  benefit  from  the  amendments  made  in  this
legislation. They are the people without whom South Africa cannot  boast  of
food self-sufficiency at national level, without whom  South  Africa  cannot
be the world player, albeit small,  in  the  world  market  in  agricultural
goods.

They are also  the  individuals  and  communities  that  contribute  to  the
country's  rural  economy  and  are  therefore  critical  players  in  rural
development. Through their participation in the land care programme, one  of
our flagship programmes which helps to educate all of us about why  we  need
to take care of our land as well as how we need to be responsible in  making
sure as we work it, we are able to create  the  possibility  of  sustainable
management of our natural resources. It  is  these  people  who  create  the
greenery in  the  rural  areas,  who  make  sure  that  our  environment  is
sustainable.

It is therefore in our interests, as  this  House,  to  make  sure  that  we
create an enabling environment that will make these  individuals  and  their
communities succeed. The review of this legislation will  make  it  possible
for oMaZondi to feel welcome in this institution, which over  the  year  had
no mechanism to address their needs. It will also ensure that  Meneer  Botha
feels as much a valuable client  of  this  institution  of  the  state.  Our
approach as the Land Bank is that in attempting  a  development  agenda,  we
are not going to lose our economic viability and therefore we are not  going
to dump our commercial clients.

Members will recall that in 1996 Cabinet  approved  the  recommendations  of
the Strauss commission on rural finance, which imposed  certain  obligations
on the Land Bank. It meant the Land Bank had to take over the  functions  of
the former Agricultural Credit Board, which was known as the  bank  of  last
resort. Interestingly,  these  institutions  dealt  with  those  who  needed
resources and were deemed unbankable by the private financial  institutions,
even the Land Bank at that stage. Even  though  it  was  not  accessible  to
oMaZondi, it, however, recognised the fact  that  if  one  needed  a  stable
rural  environment  one  had  to  support  these   individuals   and   their
communities.

Hon members would recall that at that time, when both the Land Bank and  the
Agricultural Credit Board were established, it was an attempt to  deal  with
the poor  white  problem  in  the  1930s  in  South  Africa.  Through  these
institutions,  today  we  can  boast  about  how  good  we  have  become  as
commercial farmers in South Africa.  But  it  is  through  that  development
agenda that the government of the time initiated it, because  they  realised
the need for building a rural  economy.  Unfortunately,  it  was  segregated
racially.

The Strauss commission also argued for the expansion of the services of  the
bank to all rural areas of this country  using  its  network,  building  new
services there they do not  exist  and  also  working  in  partnership  with
others. The commission acknowledged that someone had to take  responsibility
for agriculture and rural development financing in order to create a  better
livelihood with some economic activity in the rural areas  of  our  society.
This Government - our Government - understood that  it  had  to  meet  these
objectives and therefore decided that the Land Bank should play  this  role.
These obligations therefore necessitated changes in our legal  framework  in
order to satisfy the new mandate.

During the same period, however, after the promulgation of the  Constitution
in 1996, private financial institutions organised  under  Cosa  initiated  a
legal challenge on sections 34 and 55 of the  Land  Bank  Act.  They  argued
that it was unconstitutional and that it gave an advantage to the Land  Bank
that it did not give to other financial institutions.

We must say that while we understood the argument, we were  still  concerned
that such arguments did not take into consideration the risks that the  bank
was exposed to more than the private financial institutions. However,  as  a
Government that respects the rule of law and has a responsibility to  ensure
that our justice system operates, we accepted the ruling of the  court.  The
court ruled that certain clauses of sections of 34 and 55 of the  Land  Bank
Act should be removed.

However, in its judgment, the court understood that it needed to give  us  a
grace period of two  years  so  that  this  legislation  could  amend  those
relevant sections. It also understood, however, that the special  role  that
the Land Bank  was  playing  in  the  rural  market  in  particular  was  an
important one. Therefore I think it is important for  hon  members  to  know
that even if we lost the case, no obligation was imposed on us by the  court
to pay the costs.  It  was  because  they  understood  the  role  that  this
institution had to play.

The Bill before us seeks to ensure that we amend the relevant sections  that
were declared unconstitutional while at the same time  we  advance  our  own
transformational goals as defined in the RDP and further elaborated  by  the
Strauss commission in its recommendations to Cabinet in 1996.

This Bill creates a framework for the bank to do business in line  with  its
mandate. It also assists the institutions to respond to new  policy  changes
that may be  envisaged  within  the  sector.  An  example  of  this  is  the
Agricultural  Sector  Strategy  adopted  in  November   and   presented   by
Government and business to the President. Because we understand that  policy
is dynamic and changes time and again, we have structured  this  Bill  in  a
way that will ensure that we do not have to come back here time  and  again.
We have created a broad framework  that  will  allow  the  bank  to  do  its
business in line with the mandate of this Government.

It amends  certain  sections  of  the  legislation  that  impose  particular
constraints on the institution because of the detailed nature  in  which  it
was put into legislation, which did not allow the bank to  act  responsively
and quickly on the needs of its clients. It also defines the powers  of  the
Minister and those of the board of directors  in  line  with  our  corporate
governance principles as accepted by Cabinet.

It allows the Minister to  give  broad  policy  guidelines,  and  the  board
should ensure that these are taken into consideration in the preparation  of
the business plan and operation by the Land Bank as an institution. It  also
streamlines certain processes  such  as  the  design  and  the  drafting  of
contracts in such a way that it  allows  the  bank  to  structure  contracts
based on the needs and circumstance of its clients rather than what used  to
be a ``one size fits all'' model.

It also creates an opportunity where the bank can fund  joint  ventures  and
can also create subsidiaries or established agencies as an  injunction  from
the Strauss commission in order to spread its services to all parts  of  our
country. The current Bill also provides for special  provisions  which  seek
to  protect  this  institution.  This  has  been  done  having  taken   into
consideration the Constitutional Court judgment.

We are aware - the Ministry,  the  Land  Bank  as  an  institution  and  the
department - that  there  are  certain  financial  institutions  which  have
expressed  disappointment  in  this  regard.  But   we   argue   that   this
institution, as I said earlier, is exposed  to  many  risks  to  which  many
financial institutions are not exposed.

The developmental role  poses  many  challenges  which  are  time-consuming,
requiring a different  approach  as  well  as  after-care  that  many  other
financial  institutions  are  not  willing  to  provide,  and  dealing  with
oMazondi, who are illiterate and far from all the beautiful areas like -  if
I  may  mention  an  area  which  people  from  KwaZulu-Natal  will  know  -
Kwamamfene in Ngwavuma in KwaZulu-Natal, which take time to  reach  by  car.
Not all the nice institutions are willing to go there,  but  the  Land  Bank
has to  go  there  because  it  has  to  respond  to  the  mandate  of  this
Government.

These are some of the challenges that are not the  same  for  all  financial
institutions. Therefore, in our view, we do need to see the Land Bank  as  a
special institution. But the other reason is that we, as the Land Bank,  are
there for the richer and the  poorer.  We  cannot  walk  away.  We  have  to
respond to the policies of Government as the shareholder  and  therefore  we
cannot cherry-pick.

Hon members know that when one goes to apply for a loan at  Absa  -  I  will
use Absa as an example because that is where I  bank  -  they  can  look  at
one's profile, income and expenditure and say, ``We  really  think  you  can
get this loan amount.'' They can also decide that they cannot  fund  someone
as a farmer but can fund somebody else who wants to have a mortgage  to  buy
a house or someone who wants to buy a Jeep Cherokee or some other  car.  But
the Land Bank is there solely for land and agriculture,  and  nothing  else.
So we cannot cherry-pick. We are here for  the  long  haul.  As  our  slogan
says, ``We stand by you,'' meaning that whether there is an  El  Niño  today
or tomorrow, floods or extreme drought, we will not walk away.

Even though, in the products that we offer, which  are  the  loans  that  we
give to farmers, we are sometimes dependent on the climate -  which  is,  in
my view, a God-given Nasdaq that is not traded at the stock  exchange  -  we
are not going to go away. We will always be there.

It is  our  view,  therefore,  that  those  who  are  raising  concerns  and
expressing disappointment about these special provisions in the  legislation
will appreciate that the challenges and obligations we  face  are  different
from theirs. Actually, in my view, we would be very happy if  they  took  an
even higher share of the risk by extending their existing markets  to  where
we are. We do not mind competition, but I think they must come to  where  we
are.

The success we have achieved thus far indicates  to  us  that,  through  the
amendments that we have made in this legislation, we  can  do  even  better.
Today we can say with pride that the institution  has  70 000  clients  from
the historically disadvantaged communities, people  who  were  seen  as  the
unbankable poor not so long ago. Of them, 65% are women. What makes us  even
prouder is that their repayment of the debt is 80% -  an  encouraging  trend
indeed. We want to maintain this and do even better.
Given the challenges that we face in the transformation of our  agricultural
sector, the question that other people may ask is: Where does this bank  fit
in in the broad, overall Government policy? The  answer  is  that  the  Land
Bank is the premier Government development institution that  specialises  in
the provision of rural and agricultural financial services in South  Africa.
Its mandate is to implement the constitutional  and  policy  imperatives  of
the Government and to promote, support and facilitate  land  redistribution,
food security and agricultural growth and development. Its focus is  on  the
agricultural sector and  all  its  clients  as  a  whole.  It  is  therefore
supposed to render focused financial services  to  the  entire  spectrum  of
farmers and rural entrepreneurs.

This  is  what  defines  the  bank  as  different   from   other   financial
institutions. Its main focus is on agriculture and land, not anything  else.
The inherent risk in this sector means that it  does  not  offer  that  much
razzmatazz to other financial institutions, but  we  will  always  stand  by
those we serve. Even for those  who  are  in  the  sector  to  some  degree,
agriculture is not their sole mandate, as I said earlier.  They  have  other
portfolios that, depending on what the market  looks  like,  can  change  in
terms of where they rank in their mandates. As for us,  we  will  always  be
there.

It is for this reason that I commend this Bill for approval by  this  House.
[Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Minister, special  delegates  and  permanent
delegates, MECs, has everyone here  been  listening?  I  realise  that  some
members were not listening. They are not aware of how important  this  piece
of legislation is and  how  people  outside,  on  the  peripheries  of  this
country, are waiting for it.

That is why, when the Minister was worried about whether the NCOP would  let
this piece of legislation go through,  my  select  committee  overwhelmingly
decided to pass it. Even though they might have felt the necessity for  some
changes that could have delayed it, because this Bill is long overdue,  they
overwhelmingly said that it must go through. If ever amendments have  to  be
made, they can be made later, once the Bill is in use.

I am asking whether hon members have listened so as to hear the  good  news.
This is good news, in fact, for our people. Agricultural  development  plays
an important role in the social and economic development  of  South  Africa,
where large numbers of people live in rural areas. It is directly linked  to
increased food production and higher nutritional standards, which are  vital
for our subcontinent.

Therefore the role of the Land and Agricultural Development Bank  cannot  be
divorced  from  the  broader  struggle  for  economic  growth   and   social
development. The bank plays a  crucial  enabling  role  in  economic  growth
through the provision of financial  services  for  agriculture  and  related
services, particularly to those who were denied  access  because  of  racial
discrimination.

Although, in terms  of  the  old  Act,  the  Land  Bank  provided  financial
assistance for agriculture, this assistance was specifically aimed at  white
Afrikaner  farmers.  since  its  formation  in  1912,  the  Land  Bank   has
systematically and deliberately ignored black people.

As an institution it basically stood outside the broad social  and  economic
development framework of a postapartheid  South  Africa.  It  functioned  in
isolation  from  other  government  programmes  aimed  at   empowering   the
previously disadvantaged majority. Most importantly, the Land Bank lacked  a
developmental perspective  which  could  make  it  a  strategic  partner  in
achieving  the  social  and  economic  objectives   of   our   postapartheid
Government.

The rural poor want to increase their income. For  this  they  need  credit.
However,  they  seldom  have  assets  to  offer  as  collateral,  are  often
illiterate and live in remote areas far away from the nearest  bank  branch.
If one adds to this  the  fact  that  commercial  banks  are  not  eager  to
undertake the risks involved in  lending  without  adequate  collateral,  it
becomes clear that many rural households are denied access to credit.

It is this background against which one must appreciate the  important  role
which the Land Bank performs. Because it plays such an important role it  is
essential that the bank be underpinned by  a  solid  legal  framework  which
compels it to serve as a provider for those who cannot  turn  to  commercial
banks for assistance. Hence this Bill.

The process of transforming the Land Bank  already  started  in  1997,  when
Cabinet adopted the recommendations of the  Strauss  commission,  which  was
set up to look at the role of the Land Bank, as the Minister  said.  One  of
the most important decisions taken was to extend the role of the  Land  Bank
to enable it to support other Government programmes aimed  at  land  reform,
agricultural development and the eradication of  inequalities,  particularly
in our rural areas.

In the first three years after the transformation process started  in  1997,
the number of black clients of the bank  increased  to  23%  and  more  than
13 000 loans were advanced to emerging farmers. In the year 2000  alone  the
monetary value of approved loans  was  R481  million.  This  represented  an
improvement of 106% on the loans made in 1999. This  was  despite  the  fact
that at the end  of  1999  the  bank  had  set  itself  the  target  of  40%
improvement.

Over and above the more than  13 000  individuals  who  benefited  from  the
bank's commercial loans, the bank also made more than 56 000  loans  to  the
value of R61 million to formerly disadvantaged South Africans  in  terms  of
its microfinance scheme called Step Up. The Step Up scheme is  designed  for
customers, especially rural women, who require smaller loans without  having
to put up collateral.

In addition to this success the Land Bank also gave a number  of  grants  to
different provinces and communities involved  in  rural  development  during
the course of last year. My own province,  North  West,  has  benefited.  An
amount of R209 000 that was awarded to the provincial  department  was  used
for  skills  development  training  to  speed  up  the  process  of   giving
previously disadvantaged communities the necessary training,  so  that  they
could get into mainstream agriculture.

When we embarked on the  transformation  process  at  the  Land  Bank,  many
people were sceptical. Many of them  believed  the  Land  Bank  would  fail,
because they did not see how to  the  bank  could  continue  to  effectively
service commercial agriculture, while at the same time broadening its  focus
to include historically disadvantaged farmers in  the  agricultural  sector.
The figures about development  since  we  embarked  on  this  transformation
process have proved the sceptics wrong.  We  will  continue  to  prove  them
wrong with this new Bill.

The Bill requires that the board administer the accounts  of  the  bank  and
enables the bank to form subsidiaries and enter  into  joint  ventures.  The
Bill prohibits any person from disclosing any information obtained  for  the
purpose  of  rendering  agricultural  financial  services.  Any  person  who
contravenes this  provision  will  be  guilty  of  an  offence.  An  Act  of
Parliament can only wind up the bank. The draft legislation  also  sets  out
general offences, which  could  be  committed  by  any  person  involved  in
corrupt practices.

Let me conclude by saying that this is good  news  to  all  South  Africans.
That is why I checked with the House as to whether they had listened to  the
Minister. We are proud of the  Minister,  who  has  the  foresight  and  the
vision at the right time, whom we have to support so that we deliver at  the
end of the day. The people of South Africa, those who are at the  periphery,
who are pushed, are waiting eagerly for this good news and the House  should
be the force to inform them right on  the  ground.  We  thank  the  hon  the
Minister heartily. Let us join hands and walk tall to deliver to the  people
of South Africa. [Applause.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Voorsitter, mag ek my ook net by die  voorsitter  van  die
gekose komitee voeg en sê dat ons ook die Minister steun. Ons  is  trots  op
haar en ons dink sy is 'n baie goeie Minister.  [Madam  Chairperson,  may  I
also just associate myself with the chairperson of the select  committee  in
that we also support the Minister. We are proud of her and we think  she  is
a very good Minister.]

The Bill before us today is  the  result  of  a  Constitutional  Court  case
involving the First National Bank against the Land Bank. Sections 34 and  55
of the Land Bank Act were judged unconstitutional and these sections had  to
be amended or replaced before 9 June 2002 to escape invalidation.

The Strauss commission released its report on 18 September 1996 and  Cabinet
approved its recommendations on 6 August 1997. It  is  therefore  not  clear
why this Bill in its original form was  only  introduced  to  our  committee
late in May 2002.

The Land Bank has played  a  very  important  role  in  the  development  of
agriculture in South Africa. It also established an important  principle  in
financing agriculture, where the bank used 80% of the  productive  value  of
the farm as collateral and not the market value of the farm as a  basis  for
securing a loan. The function of the Land Bank, according to  the  new  Act,
is to finance developing agriculture.

The DP respects and agrees with the concept of the Bill  in  bringing  about
equity and  levelling  the  playing  fields  in  regard  to  the  previously
disadvantaged rural communities.  We  would,  however,  like  to  raise  the
following  concerns.  Although  the  Minister  has  addressed  them,  and  I
therefore feel much more at ease in my heart, and I would  like  to  mention
them.

The first one is how the Land Bank will operate within the framework of  the
Financial Services Board Act, in the light of its dual  role  as  a  profit-
orientated  financial  institution  on  the  one  hand,  and  a  development
institution  on  the  other.  It  seems  inappropriate  to  have   to   pass
legislation  that  could  have  legal  implications  and  consequences   and
thereafter require further amending, because  the  Bill  had  to  be  rushed
through.

Secondly, the President released a strategic plan  for  agriculture  at  the
end of 2001. This plan mentioned the need  to  devise  innovative  financial
instruments to help new and existing  farmers  manage  the  effect  of  high
interest rates on cash flow, the importance of financial institutions  being
globally competitive, the establishment of locally based and  microfinancial
institutions that include financial service co-ops  and  village  banks  and
innovative substitutes for collaterals. Yet  this  Bill  ignores  all  these
issues.

Die derde bekommernis is dat geld vir ontwikkelende landbou  en  kommersiële
landbou nie afsonderlik gehanteer word nie.  Die  sukses  van  die  wet  sal
bepaal word  slegs  as  die  Landbank  sterk  betrokke  is  en  bly  by  die
finansiering van kommersiële landbou. Die Minister het dit ook inderdaad  in
haar toespraak bevestig. Ek is baie dankbaar daaroor,  veral  waar  dit  die
nodige geld sal genereer om ontwikkeling in die landbou  te  finansier.  Die
staat sal nie net geld kan beskikbaar stel om rente te subsidieer nie,  maar
ook  vir  die  slegte  skulde  wat   as   gevolg   van   groot   risiko   by
ontwikkelingslandbou gaan ontstaan. Die Minister het daarna  verwys  en  ons
staan op die vooraand van 'n El Niñosiklus van gure  weersomstandighede,  en
die nodige fasiliteite en ``a code of good practice'' soos  voorgestel  deur
Agri  SA  sal  ingestel  moet  word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

The third concern is that money for developing  agriculture  and  commercial
agriculture is not handled separately. The success of the law could only  be
determined if the Land Bank is strongly involved and keeps to the  financing
of commercial agriculture. The Minister also indeed confirmed  this  in  her
speech. I am very thankful for that, especially where it would generate  the
money necessary to finance development in agriculture. The state  would  not
only be able to make money available to subsidise  interest,  but  also  for
the bad debts  which  will  develop  as  a  result  of  the  great  risk  in
development agriculture. The Minister referred to it and we are on  the  eve
of an El Niño cycle of bad weather conditions, and the necessary  facilities
and a code of good practice, as suggested by  Agri  SA,  would  have  to  be
established.]

The DP supports this Bill and we support the hon the Minister with the  hope
and trust that the legislation before us today  meets  the  expectations  of
all our new farmers-to-be. [Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Madam Chair, the UDM supports  the  passage  of  this  Bill,
because its intentions will unquestionably be of  great  assistance  to  the
farmers and the farming community as a whole.

We welcome the provision as set out in clause 33 (4)(d) of  this  Bill  that
any person affected by a court order may, through  a  competent  court,  set
aside such an order. It will give one time and opportunity to  mitigate  the
order in court by addressing the circumstances that led to one's failure  to
service a debt. This process will enable the loaner  and  the  defaulter  to
reach a compromise.

Previously the loaner could  arbitrarily,  through  the  services  of  legal
representatives and the sheriff, seize the defaulter's property and  subject
it to public auction. This practice was tantamount to a gross  violation  of
human rights, and one's dignity or integrity. After all, no  man  should  be
condemned unheard.

The second matter I wish to emphasise regarding the functions of  the  board
is that of the interest rate of banks which operate along the same lines  as
commercial banks. I am made to understand that there is a 17% interest  rate
per annum on the loan  made,  but  I  have  just  heard  recently  that  the
Minister has indicated an 8% interest rate. Another concern  following  this
observation is that this rate applies throughout all levels of  farming,  be
it for established  commercial  farmers  or  for  emerging  or  historically
disadvantaged farmers, as well as the agricultural co-operatives.

Emerging  farmers  and  the  historically  disadvantaged   sector   of   the
population will not be able to cope with  or  successfully  service  a  debt
which grows at the rate of 18% per annum. The board has  to  look  into  the
matter seriously, given that the Bill  targets,  among  others,  those  that
were previously disadvantaged. They are coming into the  mainstream  of  the
agricultural industry.
I know of three incidents -  and  I  need  not  mention  the  names  here  -
involving people who could not service their debt and whose  background  was
inadequate really to be able to make a living out of  the  loan,  given  the
interest rate of 18% per annum. They sold their tractors.  They  sold  their
homes. They have just relocated to Mkuku.

Lastly, I would like  to  give  my  interpretation  with  regard  to  clause
8(6)(a). This clause provides that when we speak of a ``broad  cross-section
of the population of the Republic'', we also refer to the deployment of  the
members of the board in terms of geographical distribution. I am afraid,  if
one goes to Johannesburg, it is a heterogenous society with Shangaan,  Zulu,
English and Afrikaans people. One could easily be  tempted  to  take  people
from that area, because they form a broad cross-section of  the  population.
I therefore appeal to the Minister to look into ensuring  that  some  people
serving on the board come from the Northern Province, from the  Free  State,
from the Northern Cape or the  Eastern  Cape.  Perhaps  one  could  talk  of
equity in representation.
These are the few observations I wanted to put across to the  Minister,  and
in particular to the representatives of the Land  Bank  who  are  here.  Our
main concern in farming practices is the question  of  interest  rates,  for
which we feel we need to design a profile that will suit various  levels  of
farming - the woman on the ground and the commercial farmer  and  those  who
are emerging. What is happening is that we have a blanket rate  of  interest
for all, and this definitely suffocates those  who  are  still  emerging  as
farmers. [Time expired.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, as a farmer it is good to interact  with  a
forceful and focused Minister such as the Minister for Agriculture and  Land
Affairs whom we have here, somebody who makes a commercial  farmer  like  me
feel at home and part of the  agricultural  industry  and  even  wanted  and
needed. I thank the Minister for that.

Since 1994, my party and I have promoted and supported land reform in  South
Africa.  From  the  outset  we  argued  and   felt   very   strongly   about
sustainability in the process. It does not make any agricultural sense  just
to give people land because they were removed from it because  of  political
considerations  during  the  apartheid  era  or  just  because  a   specific
Government project makes it possible for them, as an individual or a  group,
to get hold of a piece of land. To be on land is really the easy  part,  but
to stay on the land without destroying the land or oneself or  one's  family
is really the difficult part.

To  participate  in  the  agricultural  industry  and  to  be  a  successful
commercial farmer needs four very important ingredients. The  first  one  is
the will to not only sit on the  land  -  or  retire  on  the  land  as  the
Minister said - but to be a successful farmer. The second  is  to  have  the
appropriate land and third  the  money  to  develop  a  sustainable  farming
business.  Then  we  need  research,  training  and  technical  support   to
continuously empower the new entrants. Maybe this is some of the  after-care
the Minister spoke about.

This Bill, apart from other goals the Minister spelt  out,  also  seeks  the
enhancement of productivity, profitability,  investment  and  innovation  in
the agricultural and rural financial systems. The bank is given a  space  to
broaden its activities in ensuring that  agricultural  and  rural  financial
services are maintained by providing grant funding, providing crisis  relief
finance within its field  of  operation  and  providing  export  and  import
finance within its field of operation and making equity investment.

This Bill and the Land Bank,  with  all  the  positive  elements  mentioned,
cannot be seen in isolation, as money and the management  of  the  bank  are
only one of the four determining factors  for  success  in  agriculture.  As
this money is high-risk money, it must be made accessible to the people  who
really have the will to  succeed  in  agriculture.  Access  to  agricultural
research, training and support must be looked at as  a  priority  to  really
empower our people in the rural areas.

Commercial banks have bankrupted many good farmers in the past because  they
know everything about money but nothing about farming. The Land  Bank  knows
about farming.  That  is  the  good  news  the  chairperson  of  the  select
committee spoke about.

Lightheartedly, people say that anyone who wants to  make  a  small  fortune
out of agriculture must start with a big one. We cannot  allow  participants
to get money and just use it in agriculture until it is  finished  and  then
be in the same or even a worse  position  they  were  in  before  they  were
granted the opportunity to get involved in agriculture. There are  cases  in
the new South Africa, since 1994, where people were put on  land  and  where
they are in worse situations now than they were before.  I  hope  this  Bill
and the Land Bank will really help in these poverty pockets we have as  well
and bring redress.

The  Bill  before  the  House  has  the  ingredients  to  assist  not   only
individuals but also South  Africa  to  really  reform  agriculture  into  a
viable industry for all our  people  and  also  to  contribute  towards  the
development and reform of agriculture in the rest of Africa. If we  succeed,
the rest of Africa will follow.

The New NP supports the Bill and we thank  the  hon  the  Minister  for  her
emphasis on sustainability and her acknowledgement of the importance of  the
commercial farmers in South Africa. We also thank the Minister for  standing
by the farmers of South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Chairperson, hon Minister  and  hon  members,  one  feels
honoured and privileged to participate in the debate on such  a  progressive
and transformative piece of legislation. The Minister  has  spoken  and  the
chairperson of the select committee has spoken.

An HON MEMBER: And Van Nierkerk has spoken. [Laughter.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: We  have  all  heard,  and  that  includes  the  hon  Mrs
Versfeld, although she still wants to hear more. She  said,  in  her  words,
that some of the other points she had wanted to raise were  covered,  but  I
do not know whether she raised them so that she could again gain the  wisdom
of the hon the Minister. Or is it only because in the DA,  or  DP  nowadays,
we understand that they are monitored, and if they speak good of the  ruling
party people will think they are just about to cross the floor?  [Laughter.]
[Interjections.]

But all the same, one must say that when assistance was given  to  the  poor
whites, most of whom are rich now,  such  sentiments  about  bad  debts  and
risks were not raised.

It is now, when  we  are  giving  access  to  the  previously  disadvantaged
people, that we speak of El Niño and other weather  phenomena.  I  will  not
spoil my speech by concentrating much on what she raised. I  will  leave  it
to the hon the Minister who, I  am  very  confident,  will  deal  with  that
matter if she thinks it is worth her while. [Laughter.]

The Land and Agricultural Development Bank Bill repeals the  Land  Bank  Act
of 1944, which in certain instances is outdated and  also  unconstitutional,
as has been said. We  are  looking  at  this  Bill  to  go  a  long  way  in
redressing the racially discriminatory practices and laws of the  past.  The
hon the Deputy President, Jacob Zuma, said;


  The Government seeks to  transform  rural  areas  in  South  Africa  into
  economically viable, socially  stable  and  harmonious  areas.  The  main
  targets will particularly  be  the  rural  poor,  women,  youth  and  the
  disabled. Rural local economies must grow if they are to be  sustainable.
  Adopting an integrated approach has ensured that all  possible  areas  of
  development have been explored and that all gains are  of  a  sustainable
  nature.

The relevance of this Bill is clear from the stated objects of the Land  and
Agricultural  Development  Bank,  being  the  promotion,  facilitation   and
support, inter alia, of the increase of ownership of  agricultural  land  by
historically disadvantaged persons and also of  programmes  that  contribute
to agricultural aspects of rural development and job creation.  Furthermore,
the bank  must  promote  the  enhancement  of  productivity,  profitability,
investment and innovation in the agricultural and rural financial systems.

We must say that we are aware of certain harsh voices  opposing  this  Bill.
They come with various tunes which unfortunately  are  not  worth  recording
for public consumption. One argument  is  that  the  Land  and  Agricultural
Development bank should be treated equally, just like the  other  commercial
banks. They may look similar, as all  of  them  are  called  banks,  but  in
essence they are not the same. The Land Bank is state-owned and  the  others
are not, hence their mandates and policies are not of the  same  nature  and
thus they have different clientele and outcomes. My  understanding  is  that
the Land Bank is not expected to competitively increase its market share  to
the detriment of the other commercial banks.

As has been said, I will not waste much time on what  the  critics  of  this
Bill are saying. That has a risk of people  remembering  bad  things  rather
than the good which the hon the Minister is coming up with.

Our country South Africa  is  on  the  right  course,  led  by  a  visionary
leadership. It is in that light that I would like to  commend  the  sterling
leadership role our hon Minister Thoko Didiza is  playing  in  this  regard.
She is living testimony that women can  lead,  and  can  lead  successfully.
[Applause.] The slogan and the motto of the Land Bank  say,  ``We  stand  by
you.''

The  prevalence  of  rural  poverty  provides  major  challenges  for   both
Government and civil society. It warmed my heart, during the briefing  which
we had in the committee, when it was put in  no  uncertain  terms  that  the
Land Bank sees itself as part of a  collective  for  rural  development  and
hence part of the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy.

The development finance model of the bank ensures  a  better  life  for  the
rural poor by giving them access to finance enabling  them  to  be  farmers,
which makes dreams come  true.  I  come  from  Mpumalanga,  so  the  Nkomazi
Irrigation Expansion Programme comes immediately to mind, where  241  viable
farming opportunities have been created, and where  723  permanent  and  190
seasonal jobs have been created thus far. Annual wages for the labour  force
are estimated at R3,5 million and about R700 000 for the  seasonal  workers.
Of course this becomes a boost for local economic growth.

This is but one of the many  occurrences  of  service  delivery  within  our
country.  Even  a  blind  person,  through  hearing  the  rumblings  of  the
caterpillar tractors as new agricultural fields are opened, can see that  we
are  a  nation  seriously  at  work  -  work  to  bring  about   sustainable
agricultural development, and work to better the lives of our people. It  is
only those who are in a political coma who cannot open their  eyes  and  see
that delivery by Government is taking place. Through this Bill and the  Land
Bank, we are pushing the frontiers of poverty back. As the  ANC  we  support
the passage of this Bill. [Applause.]

[The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Mr  Chairperson,  it  is  an
honour for me to be afforded this opportunity to reply to those hon  members
who voiced their ideas in this House. I would like to thank my  brother  the
hon member who has just spoken, the  hon  Mr  Windvoël.  I  thought  that  I
should please him by  speaking  a  language  that  is  spoken  in  the  area
adjacent to his. [Interjections.] I  am  the  daughter  of  a  princess.  My
mother is a Swati, and my father  is  a  Zulu  -  those  from  KwaZulu-Natal
should not be jealous. [Laughter.]

What the hon member said is true. As he said, these days even the blind  can
hear the noise of the tractors, they know and can perceive that the  present
Government is at work. And, again ... [Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!  Minister,  I  understand  there  is  no
interpreting available. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson, I  am  going  to
summarise what I have just said in English.

Ngitsandza  kusho   futsi   kutsi   mhlawumbe   nalabekunene   labasemakhaya
abawafundzi  lamaphephandzaba  lamanyenti  lacamb'  emanga,  latjela  bantfu

sikhatsi lesingakanani. Ngabo-ke labantfu  laba  lesikhuluma  ngabo  lamuhla
sitsi lamuhla litfuba selabo. (Translation of Siswati paragraph follows.)

[I would like to say I hope that the people who live in remote  rural  areas
do not read the many newspapers that  feed  our  people  false  information.
They hear the truth on Radio Ligwalagwala when we speak and  they  also  see
for themselves that this Government is working. Those are  the  very  people
who fought for our independence. They do not want to rush into change.  They
know how much time it takes for these  changes  to  be  realised,  and  that
building everything up will take a long time. These are the  people  we  are
talking about today when we say now is their opportunity.]

Chairperson, hon members, I was thanking the members  for  participating  in
the debate, and also affirming what the hon Windvoël said at the  end,  that
indeed even those who are our critics, who may not be able to see, can  hear
the caterpillars moving; see for themselves that we are a Government and  we
are a people at work. I also said those rural masses  of  our  country,  who
may not have access to the various  media,  particularly  the  print  media,
which sometimes do not tell the truth about what is happening, do listen  to
the radio, but they stay in those communities where we are  making  changes.
They are therefore the witnesses who can testify that things  have  changed.
They are not just sitting and expecting  change,  they  work  to  make  that
change possible.

What I am happy about in this debate is that all of us  as  South  Africans,
no matter what our political persuasion, appreciate the  importance  of  the
agricultural sector in our economy. We also appreciate the need for  setting
up an enabling environment in which all South Africans can  thrive.  Clearly
we may not see things in the  same  way  because  our  own  experiences  and
circumstances in some way influence us and our thoughts  about  how  we  see
things.
But, as I said earlier, what is encouraging is that we are coming  together,
we have consensus that this Bill creates better opportunities for all  South
Africans. To confirm what Mrs Versfeld said, that she heard my  introductory
speech. Indeed, this Bill is not about developing farmers; it is  about  all
farmers of South Africa. It is  for  this  reason  that  Agri  SA  and  Nafu
support this Bill.

Maybe it is opportune at this time to thank Monwabisi  Fandeso,  the  MD  of
the bank, as well as his legal support, Mr Verna, who is with him,  and  all
the staff of the Land Bank in the national office and in the regions.  While
they  understand  the  imperative  of  transformation,  they   have   always
maintained  the  balance  and  given  support  to  our  existing  commercial
farmers. That is why I said earlier that oMaZondi will  feel  part  of  this
institution just as Meneer Botha will also feel part of this institution.

Maybe what defines this new Government is that  even  though  it  understood
that we had to change the legacy of the past, it appreciated what  was  said
in the Freedom Charter in 1955, that South Africa belonged to all who  lived
in it, black and white. It is for this  reason  that  it  will  continuously
ensure that we  work  towards  building  a  nonracial  South  Africa,  where
tomorrow we will always first say, ``I am South African,''  before  we  say,
``I am DP'' or ``I am ANC.'' I think this is what we should all strive,  for
because this is what will build a better South Africa for our children.

Maybe what is good about South Africans is that we are all willing to  share
our experiences. I have always told people that when I started as  a  Deputy
Minister, I was  given  the  responsibility  of  dealing  with  agricultural
finance. Mr Van Niekerk said to me that it was a tradition that  all  Deputy
Ministers were given this responsibility. It  is  a  very  hard  one  indeed
because one has to deal  with  what  one  could  call  the  fundamentals  of
development in the agricultural sector, the  need  for  credit.  As  Mr  Van
Niekerk said, ``You can have the land, but if you do not have the  resources
to work with it, it is as good as nothing.''

When I went through that process, looking at the Agricultural Credit  Board,
its services and what it was doing,  looking  at  what  the  Land  Bank  was
doing,  but,  more  than  anything,  looking  at  the  politics  behind  the
establishment of this institution,  I  said  that  South  Africa  was  lucky
because we still had an institutional memory. We have people like  Koos  van
Zyl - some members know him - who can tell one what the basis was of  coming
up with these  various  amendments  because  of  the  experiences  that  the
farmers went through during that period.

I think that sometimes as South Africans we become  very  negative  and  are
critical, maybe for political point-scoring at  some  stage.  It  should  be
possible for us to look back and ask: What was it that  helped  us  to  deal
with the poor white problem in this country? What is it that we need  to  do
to deal with the poor black problem today? Those members who have  read  the
Carnegie Foundation's report of 1933 around  the  poor  white  problem  will
tell the others that the problems that we  experience  as  black  people  of
this country today were experienced by white people in  this  country  then.
Issues of alcoholism, issues that are related to poverty  and  disease  were
as much problems for white people then as they are  for  blacks  today.  But
they sat and designed strategy that turned the situation around.

Some members who know the history of the railways in South  Africa  and  the
development of towns will know why one had a number of smallholdings  around
Johannesburg and Pretoria. It was because one needed to  bring  people  from
the land and make them blue-collar  workers  in  the  cities.  In  order  to
attract them one needed to ensure they  could  still  go  back  and  have  a
little ``kiep-kiep'' [chicken] there, and a goat and a sheep. I  think  this
is an experience and a history and  we  must  appreciate  that.  If  we  use
history correctly it can help us to build a prosperous South Africa.

What this Land Bank Bill is doing is to create an enabling environment  that
will help us to kick-start aboMaZondi and  consolidate  the  abo-van-Niekerk
on the other. It is not saying that one is against  the  other,  but  it  is
saying that these are part of our client base, important providers  of  food
and fibre for our society, important players in rural  development  as  well
as social stability for our  economy.  I  would  therefore  suggest  to  Mrs
Versfeld that the issue around the Financial Services Board,  if  one  looks
at the bank, its mandate and  how  it  was  created,  does  not  necessarily
arise, it is actually supervised by the SA Reserve Bank.

As we worked towards this legislation we were in constant consultation  with
the Reserve Bank  and  the  registrar  in  particular,  but  also  with  the
Financial Services Board, to ensure that we take all  of  them  with  us  in
this legislation.

The strategic plan, although one might not  see  it  written  in  black  and
white in the Bill, is covered by the products that this bank  will  provide.
The Land Bank has been a central player in the production of that  strategic
plan. I  think  it  is  important  for  us  to  remember  what  the  Strauss
commission said. The Strauss commission said that  the  bank  will  have  to
extend services where it is possible, but, as much as it  is  necessary,  it
must build links and assist the development of village banks  and  financial
institutions.

The Land Bank therefore does not want to proliferate and be  a  bigger  bank
or a superbank, but it wants to work in partnership with  others.  Therefore
the way in which the bank is structured through the proposal  in  this  Bill
allows for the creation of subsidiaries and for the co-operation in  venture
capital with some of the financial institutions at local  level.  So  it  is
taken into consideration.

Issues of risk management have been taken into consideration  by  the  bank.
As I said earlier, in some way this is where  the  bank  takes  a  different
stance from the other banks. We are not able  to  cross-subsidise  as  other
institutions may do from one portfolio to the other. In the way in which  we
manage our financial institution we have to ensure that we do what needs  to
be done. More importantly, it might be interesting for hon members  in  this
NCOP to note that the Land Bank's approach to  funding  today  is  not  just
about giving people credit and saying: ``Thank you very much, Mr Zoni,''  or
``Thank you very much, Mr Van Niekerk,'' and then telling them to  go  away.
It actually makes sure that it assists with relevant training  in  financial
management so that one is indeed able to pay back that money.

Our interest is not just in giving  people  loans.  Selfishly,  perhaps,  we
want to make sure that we get our money back, but the client also becomes  a
better financial manager. We go a step further than we did before.

Let me respond to some of the important issues raised  by  Mr  Van  Niekerk.
The after-care, as the hon member correctly said, does not  just  deal  with
this aspect of financial management training, but also makes  sure  that  it
brings all the other relevant actors in  agriculture  into  focus.  Research
and extension marketing are also very  important  for  ensuring  sustainable
agriculture, so we have taken that into consideration. That is why,  in  the
way in which we now work  in  Government,  we  ensure  that  the  family  of
institutions within the agricultural sector work together  in  support,  not
in competition, with the others.

We are doing the same with the provinces to ensure that what we  do  support
the provinces because they are at the coalface where things  are  happening.
To this end, the North West is the first province where we  have  started  a
pilot project to see what we can do to deal with the debt  question  of  the
black farmers in that province. When it succeeds it will give us a basis  on
which we can deal with debt in all our provinces.

Let me just respond to Mr Nyakane. I think there was  confusion.  The  issue
he was referring to about 80% is really the issue I was  raising  about  how
people are paying back the loans they  took,  not  the  interest  rate.  The
interest rate remains at the level at which we are. What I  was  saying  was
that the poor people to whom  we  have  given  money  have  actually  repaid
better than any others. That is the 80% repayment rate I was talking about.

However, when we talk about the interest rate - I said this two years ago  -
it is important that we do  not  isolate  the  interest  rate  as  the  only
indicator that determines success or failure. We need to look at  a  package
of things.

These people I am talking about who were able to pay back  had  an  interest
rate that some of us may think is very high, but because  they  had  support
measures, they were able to pay  back  their  debt.  Sometimes  I  think  it
becomes easier to argue for a reduction of the interest rate,  but  we  must
be very aware of the impact that an increase or  decrease  of  the  interest
rate can have right across the economy. When we  deal  with  some  of  these
issues sectorally, while we have an interest in the sector, we also need  to
take the broad economy into perspective and ask: If we make such changes  in
agriculture, what is the likely impact on the other sectors of our  economy?
Will it be better or will it  be  worse?  We  must  always  seek  a  balance
between the two.

I think it is important for me to say to this House that if it were not  for
the support of the legal team, the management of the  bank  and  the  Deputy
Minister, who have driven this process, we would not be where we are  today.
I would therefore like to apologise on behalf of Deputy  Minister  Du  Toit,
who could not be with us today because he is  in  Bali  at  the  preparatory
meeting for the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Let  me  also  tell
Mrs Versfeld that while I note her concern  about  the  delay  in  the  Bill
coming to this House, it was because we wanted to  ensure  that  we  had  as
much consultation as possible with all the relevant stakeholders.

At one stage when we thought we were ready, certain concerns brought by  one
stakeholder or the other created the delay that we found  ourselves  in.  It
was not because we were lazy or sitting on our laurels  and  doing  nothing;
it was because we needed to ensure that we took everybody,  particularly  in
this sector, with us in this amendment.

With those few words,  I  thank  you,  Chairperson,  and  the  hon  members.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

     Industry (Vote 31) for the 2002/3 financial year as well as the forward
     estimates for 2003/4 and 2004/5 included in the Estimates  of  National
     Expenditure.


     Main features


     The main features of the 2002/3 budget are:


         *  The Department is allocated R2 468,6 million for  the  financial
              year 2002/3, while forward estimates anticipate  it  receiving
              R2 627,0 million and R2 787,5 million in the years 2003/4  and
              2004/5 respectively. This compares to  the  R2  214,6  million
              voted in last year's budget which rose to R2 280,1 million  in
              the Adjusted Appropriation for 2000/1. The Department's budget
              for 2001/2  is  broadly  in  line  with  last  year's  forward
              estimate for 2001/2 (which was R2 465,1 million),  as  is  the
              amount anticipated for 2003/4.  The  Department's  budget  can
              thus  be  described  as   a   constant   budget   with   minor
              fluctuations.


         *  The 2002/3 budget is divided into six  programmes,  compared  to
              the previous five. These  are:  Programme  1,  Administration,
              (6,9  %  of  the  total),  Programme  2,  International  Trade
              Development, (2,7%),  Programme  3,  Enterprise  and  Industry
              Development,  (33%),  Programme  4,  Consumer  and   Corporate
              Regulation (5,4%), Programme 5,  The  Enterprise  Organization
              (34%) and Programme  6,  Trade  and  Investment  South  Africa
              (18%). The programmes broadly correspond to  the  Department's
              operational divisions.


         *  After growing for several years,  the  budget  for  Programme  1
              stabilizes and in fact decreases slightly from R179,5  million
              in the adjusted appropriation for 2001/2 to R169,6 million  in
              2002/3


         *  The budget for activities falling under Programme  2  is  stable
              with R65, 9 million budgeted for 2002/3 compared to the R65, 5
              in the Adjusted appropriation for 2001/2. The main  activities
              budgeted for under Programme 2 are multi-lateral and bilateral
              trade  negotiations,  the  promotion   of   African   economic
              integration  and  the  activities  of   the   Commission   for
              International Trade Administration (previously  known  as  the
              Board of Tariffs and Trade)


         *  The budget for Programme 3 is  reduced  slightly  from  R854,  3
              million in the Adjusted appropriation for 2001/2  to  R815,  1
              million in 2002/3. Programme 3  is  the  Department's  largest
              programme and includes mostly transfer payments to  associated
              Council of Trade & Industry (COTII) institutions. The decrease
              in  expenditure  in  the  present  and  previous  budget  year
              reflects   the   normalization   of   expenditure    following
              significant one off transfer payments to re-capitalize  Khula,
              initial start up contributions  to  the  National  Empowerment
              Fund and  increased  contributions  to  Namac,  Proudly  South
              Africa and THRIP.


         *  Programme 4's budget is increased from R96, 8 million  to  R134,
              1 million. Some of the increase is accounted for by  transfers
              to the Companies and Intellectual Property Office (CIPRO).


         *  Programme 5's budget increases from R628, 1 million to  R840,  2
              million. 97% of the expenditure under this programme  consists
              of transfers under various business  support  programmes.  The
              increase is largely accounted for by anticipated  better  take
              up of improved support programmes, and expenditure is expected
              to rise further to R963, 8 and R1 021 million  in  2003/4  and
              2004/5.


         *  The budget for programme 6 is stable being R455,  8  million  in
              the Adjusted appropriation for 2001/2 and R443, 6  million  in
              2002/3.
         *  Transfer payments account for approximately  82%  of  the  total
              budget. A significant part of these transfer payments are made
              to associated DTI "family institutions". There are  17  public
              entities and 3 other bodies that report  to  the  Minister  of
              Trade and Industry. These now participate in regular  meetings
              of the Council of Trade and Industry Institutions.


         *  The budget for 2002/3 can also be  divided  into  the  following
              functional categories:


              @   Transfer to associated COTII R690mn 28% Institutions
              @   Incentives and Offerings to Business R1 320mn 53%
              @   Human Resources R290mn 12%
              @   Operations R170mn 7%


     The amount for incentives  and  offerings  to  firms  is  up  from  the
     approximately R1 billion in 2001/2.


         *  The Director General indicated that new systems were  being  put
              in  place  to  promote  greater  efficiency  in  the  use   of
              resources. Although these appeared to focus  on  minor  "house
              keeping" matters, they were part of a process of  getting  the
              Department  to  operate  faster,  smarter   and   quicker   in
              delivering services. For  example,  an  investigation  by  the
              Department found that in  the  recent  past  48%  of  incoming
              telephone calls were dropped. This has now been reduced to 29%


         *  The Department also reported  further  significant  improvements
              in organizational efficiency during 2001/2. For  example,  the
              average time to register companies or  close  corporations  at
              the Companies and Intellectual  Property  Office  (CIPRO)  has
              been reduced from 21 to 3 days.


         *  Once again, this year's budget  includes  in  the  Estimates  of
              National  Expenditure  a  table  of  "output  indicators"  and
              "targets" for Programmes 2-6. A  feature  of  the  Committee's
              interaction with the Department this year  was  that  we  were
              provided at our request, with a detailed Report on the  extent
              to which output and service delivery targets identified in the
              2001/2 budget were delivered upon.


         *  The latter report, which the Committee regards as a  major  step
              forward in its budgetary  oversight,  indicates  that  by  and
              large the Department  attained  most  of  the  output  targets
              identified in 2001/2. The report  also  indicates  that  there
              were  improvements  in  organizational  efficiency,  corporate
              governance and work environment.


         *  In terms of employment equity, the Department reported  that  it
              had  enhanced  the  Public  Service  Commission's  targets  of
              achieving 50% equity by race and 30% by gender and set  itself
              a target of 80% equity by race and 50% by gender. We were told
              that it had surpassed the latter targets,  although  there  is
              still a need to address the issue of gender equity in the more
              senior grades.


         *  The improvement in the Department's record on spending  observed
              in 2000/1 was continued in 2001/2. There is now  a  reasonable
              alignment   of   budgeted   and   actual   expenditure    with
              underspending anticipated to be a little over  10%  in  2001/2
              (excluding some reductions and anticipated commitments  to  be
              rolled over) compared to the more  than  30%  recorded  before
              1999.


         *  The Estimates of National Expenditure 2002 do  not  sufficiently
              address the financial and  resource  transfers  to  provinces,
              neither  do  they  adequately  reflect  the  impact   of   the
              Department's spending in the various provinces. The Department
              through a range of  economic  development  agencies  currently
              funds and  coordinates  various  economic  programmes  in  the
              provinces and local municipalities.


     The Committee also had an opportunity, as in previous years, to  engage
     on budgetary issues with four of the DTI's associated institutions- the
     Industrial Development Corporation,  the  Council  for  Scientific  and
     Industrial Research, Ntsika and Khula. Highlights of these  discussions
     included:


     The Industrial Development Corporation (IDC)
         *  The IDC made  515  investment  approvals  worth  R9,  3  billion
              during 2001, more than double the amount in the previous year.
              These assisted in the creation or sustaining  of  20  000  job
              opportunities and  generated  R10,  5  billion  in  additional
              export earnings.


         *  The IDC is also extensively involved in  projects  elsewhere  in
              Africa. Over the past year it increased its African  portfolio
              from  30  projects  in  9  countries  to  47  projects  in  16
              countries. Approvals in other African countries  total  almost
              R7, 6 billion since 1998.


         *  The Corporation reported further  progress  in  its  efforts  to
              promote Small and Medium Enterprise  development  as  well  as
              Black Economic Empowerment. The proportion of approvals  going
              to empowerment companies was 33 % in 2001 compared to 27%  the
              previous year. By value, this represents around 16%  of  total
              approvals. Although the Corporation does not directly  service
              the micro or very small business sector,  it  has  taken  some
              steps to make its facilities available to smaller enterprises.
              68% by value of its portfolio is with clients  with  an  asset
              base below R120 million.


         *  The IDC remains financially strong with capital and reserves  of
              R24, 4 billion (larger than any  bank  in  the  country).  Its
              involvement in two poorly performing  steel  projects-Columbus
              and Saldanha- did, however, involve it in a capital loss.  R5,
              5 billion was injected into the restructuring of Saldanha  and
              its  incorporation  into  Iscor.  This  restructuring  is  now
              complete and Saldanha is now debt free, selling  its  products
              on the domestic as well as export markets.


     The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research


         *  The CSIR's  annual  turnover  is  R810  million,  of  which  60%
              emanates from clients and contracts. The Council will  receive
              just  over   R300   million   from   government   this   year,
              approximately the same as in the previous budget year.


         *  The CSIR participates in the COTII. The Council  indicated  that
              together with the DTI a number of medium term  objectives  had
              been  agreed,  including  enhancing  science  and   technology
              contributions to  industrial  technology  policy  development,
              raising awareness in industry  of  technological  development,
              contributing to development of SMMEs, BEE and access by  women
              to technology through its Technology  for  Women  in  Business
              project.  It also has 60 rural development projects,  many  in
              poverty nodes identified by government.


         *   The  CSIR  is  also  involved  in  initiatives,  projects   and
              contracts in 17 other African countries  and  is  contributing
              both to  NEPAD  and  preparations  for  the  World  Summit  on
              Sustainable Development. It has also been awarded contracts by
              major  International  Firms  including  Rolls  Royce,  Boeing,
              Daimler Chrysler and the  European  Commission  for  two  food
              related projects.


         *  The CSIR confirmed  that  the  trend  identified  last  year  of
              declining  private  sector   involvement   in   Research   and
              Development (R & D) continues to be a cause  for  concern.  We
              were told that South Africa spends around 0,7% of its GDP on R
              & D, much less than successful industrializing countries. Less
              than half this comes from the private  sector:  Reasons  which
              the Council said were cited for this included:


              1.  Less attractive tax incentives for R & D in  South  Africa
                  than other jurisdictions.
              2.  The fact that incentive schemes such as SPII were based on
                  the matching grant principle meant that there was no  real
                  incentive to begin completely new projects.
              3.   An  environment  that  did  not  sufficiently   encourage
                  university-based   researchers   to   develop   commercial
                  applications of their research.


     Ntsika Enterprise Promotion Agency


         *  Ntsika is continuing to re-focus its activities  away  from  its
              previous main activity of accrediting service providers  to  a
              demand  driven  provision  of  particular  services  to  small
              business.  Its  focuses  will  be  on  information  provision,
              training and advisory services.


         *  Ntsika is  also  carrying  out  a  review  of  service  provider
              intermediaries it has worked with, and will be dis-accrediting
              those that have not met defined performance criteria.


         *  Ntsika reported that from the time  of  its  inception  in  1996
              until the end of 2001, it had supported 349 service providers,
              trained 2 435 employees of service providers and  developed  2
              310 business links. Service providers trained or assisted over
              100 000 entrepreneurs in over 79 000 enterprises. Jobs created
              or sustained over this period are estimated at over 98 000.


         *  In 2002/3 Ntsika plans to support 280 service  providers,  train
              1 050 staff of service providers and develop  1  120  business
              links. It expects service providers to train or assist 60  900
              entrepreneurs in 81 500 SMMEs, thereby assisting  in  creating
              or sustaining 40 000 jobs.


         *  Ntsika is allocated  R40  million  in  the  current  budget,  an
              increase from the R35 million it received  in  2001/2.  It  is
              anticipated that it will receive R50 million in the 2003/4 and
              R60  million  in  the  2004/5  budgets.  The  agency  expects,
              however, to receive a substantial increase of donor funding  -
              rising to R35,1 million in 2002/3 compared to R12  million  in
              2001/2. We were told that this money was confirmed.  Including
              other smaller allocations, Ntsika would spend R85,  1  million
              in 2002/3 compared to R64, 4 million in 2001/2.


     Khula Enterprise Finance


         *  An impact assessment study on Khula's products between 1996  and
              March 2001 carried out by UNISA's Market Research Bereau found
              that these had contributed to the creation and  sustaining  of
              788  650  jobs  over  this  period.  70%  of  these  were   in
              survivalist enterprises, with a high attrition rate.


         *  Khula plans to approve loans of R106 million and  guarantees  of
              R406 million during the current financial year, leading to the
              creation or sustaining of 124 498 jobs. It aims to ensure that
              administrative expenses do not exceed 8% of the value  of  its
              activities and that a return is secured  on  its  capital  not
              less than the rate of inflation.


         *  Khula welcomed the fact that DTI plans to hive  off  funding  of
              survivalist enterprises to a new fund, saying this  will  help
              Khula to refocus its activities.


         *  Recapitalisation remains an issue for Khula, and  we  were  told
              that Khula will not be  able  to  achive  its  targets  unless
              further capital is obtained. We were told  that  of  the  R200
              million requested from DTI two years ago, Khula  received  R81
              million in 2000/1 and R30 million in 2001/2.  Of  the  funding
              requested  within  the  framework  of  its  current  five-year
              projection, we were told that Khula had received  R70  million
              from the DTI and that the re-valuation of some  properties  in
              its portfolio would add a further  R120  million.  No  further
              commitments have been made by the DTI.


     Comments
     The  committee  is  pleased  to  report  continued  progress   in   the
     management, presentation, and reporting on the  DTI's  budget.  In  our
     last year' s report, we noted that programmes were more closely aligned
     to the  major  activities  of  the  Department,  that  there  was  more
     effective financial reporting that better control systems were in place
     and  that  the  trend  evident  in  previous   years   of   significant
     understanding was being corrected. All  these  achievements  have  been
     carried over into this year's budget. In  addition,  we  now  have  the
     Department reporting to the Committee on the extent  to  which  it  has
     delivered on output targets.


     In our view the latter represents an important  step  forward  for  our
     Committee in terms of its monitoring and oversight of the  Department's
     work, as well as an important step  towards  effective  outcomes  based
     budgeting. The next challenges to take this process further are, in our
     view:


         *  To find a mechanism to present and discuss  with  the  Committee
              proposed  output  targets  ahead  of  their  presentation   in
              documents tabled at the time of the budget speech.


         *  To develop a coherent and  convincing  methodology  to  indicate
              the extent to which the output targets have  impacted  on  the
              identified outcome targets viz "to lead and facilitate  access
              to sustainable economic activity and empowerment for all South
              Africans through higher  level  of  investment  and  increased
              access to international markets for  South  African  products,
              and to create a fair, competitive and efficient  market  place
              for domestic and foreign enterprises as well  for  consumers".
              We were  told  that  during  the  course  of  this  year,  the
              Department hoped to put in place reporting systems that  would
              at least enable it to identify more clearly what proportion of
              its total funding was being deployed to support SMMEs.


     As indicated above, the Committee  found  that  in  general  there  was
     improved delivery in 2001/2 on the output  targets  identified.  A  few
     matters of concern were, however, identified by  the  committee.  These
     included


         *  Whether sufficient resources are being allocated to support  our
              team involved in the WTO negotiations. This is  not  a  simple
              matter. The cost of maintaining one person in Geneva is  equal
              to employing 6 persons at director level, and  the  Department
              has already deployed the previous Deputy Director  General  of
              International  Trade  to  head  the  team  in  Geneva,   while
              establishing a dedicated team  led  by  the  former  Minister-
              Counselor in Geneva in Pretoria. The Committee is nevertheless
              of  the  view  that  the  WTO  negotiations  are  of  critical
              importance and  pose  many  challenges.  We  look  forward  to
              engaging further with the Department on how these efforts  can
              be re-enforced in, including ways in which Parliament and  our
              Committee can assist in this regard.


         *  The time it is taking  for  the  National  Empowerment  Fund  to
              become operative. After  many  years,  the  NEF  has  at  last
              received some funding from the Department  and  IDC  to  cover
              operational expenses and to launch its venture  capital  fund,
              but the NEF Corporation's substantial capitalization  has  yet
              to take place. The Committee urges the  Department  to  ensure
              that this takes place expeditiously,  and  indicates  that  it
              will be seeking progress reports from relevant departments  in
              the near future.


         *   It  is  our  earnest  hope  that   the   recently   established
              Cooperatives  division  will  be  in  the   near   future   in
              consultation with stakeholders; devise  an  effective  support
              programme for cooperatives.


     The Provinces and Local Authorities


         *  The Department will be requested to  comment  on  the  issue  of
              provincial  transfers  indicated  above,  including   possibly
              extrapolating some figures in respect of individual  provinces
              by the time the Budget Vote debate takes place  in  the  NCOP.
              With the objective of strengthening the relationships  between
              the various economic  development  role  players,  nationally,
              provincially and locally,  we  would  also  be  interested  in
              receiving reports  quantitatively  measuring  the  employment,
              investment  and  economic  empowerment  impact,  as  well   as
              indicating successes and challenges in the  various  provinces
              and municipalities. We are aware that some of this information
              can only be supplied by MECs with regard  to  funds  generated
              from provincial revenue. In  this  respect,  we  call  on  the
              Minister to request these inputs from  MECs  via  the  Min-MEC
              process. MECs could also  be  instrumental  in  generating  an
              economic  status  report  from  local  authorities  in   their
              respective provinces. It is envisaged  that  the  NCOP  debate
              will provide a  useful  forum  for  MECs  to  deliver  initial
              reports this year, and more comprehensive  reports  in  coming
              years within the MTEF framework.
