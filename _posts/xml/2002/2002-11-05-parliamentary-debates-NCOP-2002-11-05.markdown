ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Minister  Mufamadi,  I  notice  you  are
amazed by the linguistic dexterity I displayed in opening  the  proceedings.
[Laughter.] I am waiting to practice my Tshivenda.

                                 NEW MEMBER

                               (Announcement)

The Chairperson announced that the vacancy  in  the  representation  of  the
Northern Province caused by the resignation of Mr  M  L  Mushwana  had  been
filled by the appointment of Mr M J Mahlangu with  effect  from  31  October
2002.

                                    OATH

Mr Mahlangu  had  made  and  subscribed  the  oath  in  the  office  of  the
Chairperson on 5 November 2002.

     ELECTION OF PERMANENT DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF
                                  PROVINCES

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! There will now  be  an  opportunity  for
nominations for the Permanent Deputy Chairperson of the National Council  of
Provinces in terms of section 64(2)  of  the  Constitution.  Are  there  any
nominations?

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, I, Masilo  Makoela,  hereby  nominate  Mr  M  J
Mahlangu as Permanent Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP. I  do  this  with  the
full trust that Mr Mahlangu, having served in the institution of  Parliament
as a member of the National Assembly, has the ability to fill the position.

I also know that Mr Mahlangu has been serving as Chairperson  of  Committees
in  the  National  Assembly,  and  that  having  been  part  of  the  Codesa
negotiations, he knows where the NCOP comes from and therefore is not  going
to be new to this House, even if he has not served in it. I also trust  that
he has the ability to carry out the work entrusted to him.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr M J Mahlangu  has  been  nominated.  Is  the
nomination seconded?

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson,  I,  Joyce  Kgoali,  second  the  hon  Makoela's
nomination of Mr M J Mahlangu, knowing full well that Mr  Mahlangu  will  be
able to fulfil the responsibilities of the position to  which  he  has  been
elected. Mr Mahlangu has been a member since 1994 and is one of  the  people
who made possible the new Constitution that  we  adopted  in  1996.  I  feel
strongly that he is the right candidate for this position.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Could the nomination form  be  presented
to the returning officer? [Applause.] We have  not  arrived  at  that  point
yet, hon members. [Laughter.] Are there any  formal  nominations?  If  there
are not, that concludes the nomination. Could the returning officer  examine
the form and indicate whether it is indeed correct?

Only one candidate has been nominated:  Mr  Mninwa  Johannes  Mahlangu.  The
nomination is in order, and in  terms  of  item  5  of  Schedule  3  to  the
Constitution,  I  accordingly  declare  Mr  Mninwa  Johannes  Mahlangu  duly
elected as the Permanent Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces. [Applause.]

On behalf of all the delegates present here today, I  congratulate  you,  Mr
Mahlangu, on having been elected as the Deputy Chairperson of  the  National
Council of Provinces, and welcome you both to the  institution  and  to  the
very important role that you will now play.

I would now like to  afford  an  opportunity  to  the  provincial  Whips  to
express  their  votes  of  congratulation  to  the  new   Permanent   Deputy
Chairperson.

Nksz  B  N  DLULANE:  Mhlalingaphambili,  ndithi  mandithabathe  eli   thuba
ndivakalise ukuba nathi phaya phesheya kweNciba sithi Huuntshu!,  kwinkokeli
yabantu. Siyayamkela kule  Ndlu.  Siyalazi  igalelo  layo  kwaye  sithembisa
nokuba siya kuyixhasa. [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of  isiXhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson, I would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to
express our support for the leader of the people as people from  the  former
Transkei  region.  We  welcome  him  to  this  House.  We   all   know   his
contributions and we promise that we will support him. [Applause.]]

Mr T S SETONA: Madam Chair, I rise on behalf of the Free State  province  to
congratulate  Mr  Mahlangu  on  his  unopposed  election   as   the   Deputy
Chairperson of this Council. We want to tell him that he is welcome in  this
House and that he will be assured, through thick and thin in the  challenges
that are facing us as a collective and as  individuals,  of  our  unwavering
support. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, Mr  Mahlangu,  on  behalf  of  the  province  of
Gauteng I wish to add our congratulations to those of  the  other  provinces
on your election as the Deputy Chairperson of this august House. We  welcome
you in our midst, not as someone who will soon be a  member  of  this  small
and close-knit family, but in the full knowledge that you  are  already  one
of us.

Deputy Chairperson Mahlangu, please lead us with  our  hon  Chairperson.  We
are ready to follow you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I call upon  KwaZulu-Natal.  KwaZulu-Natal?  Mr
Mahlangu, you will have to sort them out at some further stage.  [Laughter.]


Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I also wish to give our overwhelming  support
as the province of KwaZulu-Natal to the election of Mr Mahlangu.

Ngithi kuMnu  Mahlangu  siyathokoza  kakhulu  ngokuthi  abe  khona  phakathi
kwethu. Siyazi ukuthi ungomunye wamaqhawe ahlabana ethule. Sengathi  kungaba
njalo. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[I would like to say to Mr Mahlangu that  we  greatly  appreciate  the  fact
that he  is  among  us.  We  know  that  he  is  one  of  those  heroes  who
unpretentiously performs great deeds. I wish it to be so. [Applause.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOÃ«L: Chairperson, as delegated by our provincial Whip  and  on
behalf of the Mpumalanga delegation, I wish to express  our  hearty  welcome
to Comrade M J Mahlangu. We want to believe that he will bring  fresh  ideas
into this institution. An old English saying goes that a -new  broom  sweeps
clean, and we believe that this broom will not be an exception.

We must also remind this august  House  that  Mr  Mahlangu  originates  from
Mpumalanga. [Laughter.] However, we must encourage him to  service  all  the
provinces and parties equally. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, on behalf of  the  Northern  Cape  I  wish  to
welcome Mr M J Mahlangu and wish him all the success. I hope  that  he  will
be able to cope with some of our mad  members  in  this  House.  [Laughter.]
[Interjections.] I am just joking. [Laughter.]

We welcome him. He should  feel  at  home  as  he  is  one  of  the  family.
[Applause.]

Chief M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, it is with pride, joy and happiness  that  I
welcome the hon M J Mahlangu, on behalf of my  peaceful  province,  to  this
august House and congratulate him on being elected to  this  very  important
chairpersonship of Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP.

He is from the Northern Province. [Interjections.] No matter  how  deep  the
bottle is, the  cream  will  always  be  on  top.  God  bless  Mr  Mahlangu.
[Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, I am delegated by the  North  West  provincial
Whip, Mr Kolweni, to welcome the hon Mr M J  Mahlangu  and  to  congratulate
him on his appointment as the Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP.

We are convinced  and  satisfied  that  given  Mr  Mahlangu's  long-standing
experience in the political field,  he  will  assist  to  the  best  of  his
ability in leading this House. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, it is my pleasure to  welcome  Mr  Mushwana  ...
[Interjections.] ... Mr Mahlangu. [Laughter.]  I  am  sorry,  I  am  getting
mixed up. I congratulate Mr Mahlangu on his  new  appointment  and  I  would
just like to say that when one looks at his CV,  which  I  called  for,  one
understands why he has been appointed to this position.

He has not been appointed to this position because he is a  party  hack  who
has made his way through the ranks, but has  been  appointed  very  much  on
merit. He has a most  distinguished  parliamentary  career.  In  the  modern
sense of the word he can be regarded  as  a  true  parliamentarian:  He  was
elected as a member of Parliament in 1994 to a parliament  which  he  helped
shape in that he was a member of the transitional  executive  from  1993  to
1994; he was co-chairperson of the multiparty negotiation process; he was  a
negotiator at Codesa; and he  participated  in  the  multiparty  negotiating
process from 1991 to 1994.

He has served on all the formations  of  this  Parliament:  as  a  committee
member, as a Whip, as the Chairperson of committees and in various roles  in
this Parliament, which will  give  him  great  insight  into  the  ways  and
machinations of this Parliament and into our needs.  Clearly,  he  is  well-
qualified for this job. We welcome him and look forward to having  him  with
us. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, before we  invite  some  of
the political parties to express their  congratulations,  I  would  like  to
note the presence of a delegation from the senate of Australia. I  ask  them
to rise so that we can acknowledge their presence. [Applause.]  Hon  Tierney
and your delegation, you are welcome to the Parliament of South Africa.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, on behalf of the DP I wish to extend  the  party's
sincere congratulations and a warm welcome to Mr M J  Mahlangu  on  his  new
appointment as the Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP.  I  am  certain  that  Mr
Mahlangu will be able to cope with the onerous responsibilities  related  to
the new position. There is no doubt that he  brings  impeccable  credentials
to the position.

Mr Mahlangu can rest assured that the DP  will  give  him  its  fullest  co-
operation in executing his duties and in elevating the profile of  the  NCOP
to new heights. Mr Mahlangu will find that this  Council,  being  the  upper
House, is rather staid in character, and more restrained and dignified  than
the cauldron of the National Assembly. [Laughter.]

In fact, he might find the change similar to a change  from  the  ridiculous
to the sublime. We have our moments of aberration, of course, as alluded  to
by the hon Mrs Lubidla, when certain miscreants do become  a  trifle  noisy,
but I am looking forward to his admonishments in those instances.

In the short time I have personally  known  Mr  Mahlangu,  he  has  been  of
amiable and cheerful disposition. The DP is pleased to welcome  him  to  our
august House as the Deputy Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, on behalf of the  New  NP  I  wish  to  add  my
congratulations to Mr M J Mahlangu on his election to this very high  office
of Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces.

I wish to assure him of our very best wishes in  this  new,  very  important
position, and to assure him also that he can rely  on  our  co-operation.  I
look forward to working very closely with him. We have known him for a  long
time and we know that he has all the ability and credentials to lead  us  in
this new position and we look forward to that. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, the IFP, like all other parties, extends  its
gratitude for, and welcomes Mr Mahlangu. We are really  very  pleased  about
the steps taken and the level to which he has been raised.

Siyathokoza kakhulu thina beNkatha  Freedom  Party  ukubona  umfowethu  uMnu
Mahlangu  ebesilokhu  simbona  khona  engale  lapho  zivame  ukushisa  khona
izinhlamvu. Uma eseze la kithina, sithokoza kakhulu-ke.

Engikuthokozela kakhulu futhi mina ukuthi kuthe uma kuhamba  uMnu  uMushwana
la  ngambona,  ngathi  mina  hhawu  sekukhona  isikhala  njalo  ngale.   Uma
sengimbona elapha ezogcina  lesi  sikhala,  kimi  kusho  ukuthi  wayekhonjwa
ngumunwe wasezulwini; phela thina singomama bebhantshi.

Siyabonga kakhulu. Sethemba uzohlala kahle nathi. [Ihlombe.] (Tanslation  of
Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[We in the IFP are very glad to  see  our  brother,  Mr  Mahlangu,  whom  we
always saw in the place where the shootings  used  to  occur.  We  are  very
happy that he has joined us.

Another thing that makes me happy is that when Mr Mushwana left,  I  saw  Mr
Mahlangu and I said to him: ``Hey! There is a vacancy there''.  Now  when  I
see him coming to fill this position, to me it means that he  was  appointed
by the finger from Heaven because I belong to the women of prayer.

Thank you very much. We hope that he will stay well with us. [Applause.]

Rre J O TLHAGALE: Motlotlegi modulasetilo, ke ema fano go tlhagisa  kamogelo

Setswana paragraph follows.)

[Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Chairperson, I stand here to  present  our  acceptance
to the hon Mr Mahlangu as the Deputy Chairperson of  the  NCOP.  We  believe
that, with his vast  experience,  he  will  lead  this  House  to  the  top.
[Applause.]]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, I rise on behalf of  the  UDM  to  express  our
sentiments, which sentiments have also been  expressed  by  other  political
parties, and to congratulate the hon  member  Mr  M  J  Mahlangu  on  having
attained his new position of Deputy Chairperson.

We trust and hope that he will uphold the trust  and  confidence  that  have
been expressed by this House in appointing him to this position. We wish  Mr
M J Mahlangu  good  luck.  We  hope  we  are  going  to  work  with  him  as
harmoniously as we did with the previous Deputy Chairperson. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Durr, I take it the ACDP has spoken.

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, on behalf of our party ... [Inaudible.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  Thank  you.  We  therefore  proceed  to  the
questions on the Question Paper. Mr Mahlangu, would you like to say a  word?
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M J MAHLANGU: Chairperson, thank you very much for the  warm  words  that
have come from the members of the House. Let me thank you, Chairperson,  for
giving me one or two minutes to respond to  the  speeches  which  have  been
delivered by the members.

I wish to thank all hon members for congratulating me. When I  was  told  by
my party that it was deploying me here, I knew this was a  great  challenge.
I know that there are no  problems  but,  rather,  challenges,  and  I  also
understand that with the support of everyone in this  House  one  will  have
great success.

Above all, I also wish to thank my party for actually showing confidence  in
me by deploying me here to take up this post. I  will  serve  all  political
parties in  this  House  with  great  loyalty  and  will  take  forward  the
challenges posed by the post.

It is not a day for a speech today, but I just want  to  end  by  quoting  a
great writer, Helen Steiner Rice, who once wrote:


  Life is a mixture of sunshine and rain,
  Laughter and pleasure, teardrops and pain,
  All days can't be bright, but it's certainly true,
  There was never a cloud the sun didn't shine through.


  So just keep on smiling whatever betide you,
  Secure in the knowledge God is always besides you,
  And you'll find when you smile your day will be brighter
  And all of your burdens will seem so much lighter.


  For each time you smile you will find it is true
  Somebody, somewhere will smile back at you,
  And nothing on earth can make life more worthwhile
  Than the sunshine and warmth of a beautiful smile.

I thank you all. I will do my best. [Applause.]

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  Order!  Thank  you,   Mr   Mahlangu,   and
congratulations on your election. We look forward to working with you.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:
  That the Council -


  (1) notes that South Africa, along with 11 other African  states  meeting
       in Abuja, have agreed in principle to subject  their  governments  to
       monitoring and democracy  in  terms  of  the  Nepad  agreement,  with
       particular reference to  the  promotion  of  good  government,  human
       rights and internationally accepted corporate practices;


  (2) salutes these  states  on  this  step  which  will  help  to  restore
       confidence in the future of Nepad and of Africa;


  (3) urges all other African signatories to Nepad to follow suit as far as
       acceptance of the peer review process is concerned;


  (4) supports the key role our country is playing in shaping the future of
       Africa; and


  (5) commits itself to working towards the objectives of  Nepad  in  South
       Africa and on the rest of the continent.

Me E C GOUWS: Voorsitter, ek is bewus dat die agb Minister  van  Sport  hier
in die Huis nou net onomwonde verklaar het dat hy nie oorweeg om uit sy  amp
te bedank nie, maar ek gaan  tog  voort  met  my  mosie  in  der  voege.  'n
Minister het 'n verantwoordelikheid en behoort  daardie  verantwoordelikheid
te alle tye en onder alle omstandighede  teenoor  al  Suid-Afrika  se  mense
gestand te doen.

Ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek by  die  volgende  sitting  van  die  Huis  sal
voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) 'n beroep op die Minister van Sport en Ontspanning doen om te  bedank
       as gevolg van sy opmerkings en moontlike skending van  menseregte  in
       'n vergadering van die Verenigde Krieketraad; en
  (2) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  twee top Suid-Afrikaanse krieketspelers, Jacques Kallis, een van
           die  beste  krieketspelers  in  die  wÃªreld,  en  Mark  Boucher,
           onderkaptein van ons Proteas, se menseregte moontlik geskend is.
           Klousule 9(3) van die Grondwet verbied  diskriminasie  deur  die
           Staat teen enige persoon op grond van ras; en


       (b)  die Minister van Sport en Ontspanning dus 'n verdelende  en  nie
           'n saambindende faktor in Suid-Afrikaanse sport is nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I am aware that the hon Minister  of  Sport  has
just now unequivocally declared in this House that  he  is  not  considering
resigning from his post, but I still  wish  to  continue  with  this  motion
accordingly. A Minister has  a  responsibility  and  ought  to  honour  that
responsibility at all times and under all circumstances  to  the  people  of
South Africa.

I hereby give notice that at the next sitting of the House I shall move:


  That the Council:


  (1) appeals to the Minister of Sport and Recreation to resign because  of
       his remarks and possible violation of human rights in  a  meeting  of
       the United Cricket Board; and


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  the human rights of two of South Africa's top  cricket  players,
           Jacques Kallis, one of the best cricket players in the world and
           Mark Boucher, vice captain of our Proteas, could  possibly  have
           been  violated.  Section  9(3)  of  the  Constitution  prohibits
           discrimination by the State against any person on the  basis  of
           race; and
       (b)  the Minister of Sport and Recreation  is  therefore  a  divisive
           rather than a binding factor in South African sport.]


      MINISTER OF SPORT COMMENDED FOR HIS DEDICATIONAND DP's CRITICISMS
                                  REJECTED


                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1)  rejects  with  contempt  the  frivolous  call  by  the  DP  for  the
       resignation of the Minister of Sport and Recreation, Comrade  Ngconde
       Balfour;


  (2) believes that the Minister's remarks should be seen in the context of
       the frustration experienced by the majority of South Africans at  the
       slow pace of transformation and racism which is still  characterising
       some of our national sporting codes;


  (3) finds it strange that the DP has kept a stony silence over the racism
       in rugby that was pointed out by a former national player and current
       coach of our national Sevens side, Chester Williams; and


  (4) commends the Minister of Sport and Recreation for his dedication  and
       commitment to bringing about real  transformation  in  South  African
       sport.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection  to  the  motion?
There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes a notice of motion.

                         CONDEMNATION OF INFANT RAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) takes note -


       (a)  of yet another infant rape, merely a year  after  the  rape  of
           baby Tsepang in Upington; and


       (b)  that Mpo, a  5-month-old  girl,  was  slaughtered  yesterday  in
           Hillbrow by a criminal with the mentality of an animal;


  (2) further condemns this act in the strongest possible way and urges the
       police and the community to act swiftly; and


  (3) requests the South African judicial system to make an example of this
       perpetrator who not only destroyed the physical and spiritual life of
       a defenceless baby, but also degraded the dignity and  reputation  of
       men in general and disgraced the total human race.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  GOOD WISHES TO ALL MUSLIMS DURING RAMADAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Muslims across the world are about to  celebrate  the  month  of
           Ramadan;


       (b)  the month of Ramadan marks the month in 610 A.D. when  the  Holy
           Qur'an was sent down as a guide to humankind  for  guidance  and
           judgement between right and wrong;


       (c)  for Muslims across the world it is a time for inner  reflection,
           devotion to God and self-control; and


       (d)  Ramadan is not only a month of moral abstinence, but it also has
           the social virtue of creating new bonds of understanding between
           people by reminding the more fortunate of the  hunger  that  the
           poor suffer; and


  (2) wishes our Muslim brothers and sisters well during their celebration.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              GOOD WISHES TO OUR HINDU POPULATION DURING DIWALI

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that yesterday Monday, 4 November 2002, marked the beginning of
       Diwali, which is one of the most popular Hindu festivals;


  (2) further notes that Diwali, also known  as  the  festival  of  lights,
       symbolises the victory of righteousness and the lifting of  spiritual
       darkness; and


  (3) as a sign of respect for our rich and diversified cultural  heritage,
       wishes our Hindu population well during their festival.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEW DEPUTY MINISTERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  Dat die Raad die nuwe Adjunkministers, Renier Schoeman en David  Malatsi,
  gelukwens met hulle aanstelling as sodanig en hulle die beste toewens  in
  hulle  nuwe  verantwoordelikhede.  ((Translation  of   draft   resolution
  follows.)


  [That the Council congratulates the new Deputy Ministers, Renier Schoeman
  and David Malatsi, on their appointments in that capacity and wishes them
  well with their new responsibilities.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  PRECEDENCE TO THE FOURTH AND FIFTH ORDERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That, after the first Order of the Day, precedence be given to the fourth
  and fifth Orders of the Day.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       COMMITMENT OF WESTERN CAPE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ASSISTING
                      DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS APPLAUDED

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Western Cape Department of Education has undertaken to
       help Hector Peterson Senior Secondary matriculants who lost all their

       their homes last weekend;


  (2) further notes that more than 300 homes  in  the  Mooi  Trap  informal
       settlement in Kraaifontein went up  in  flames  on  Saturday  leaving

       assist the disadvantaged students in the Western Cape.

REGULATION OF INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS AND PROVISION OF COMMUNICATION-
                          RELATED INFORMATION BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Security and
                       Constitutional Affairs thereon)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam  Chairperson,
it is noteworthy that during the last decade we  have  seen  tremendous  and
worldwide changes taking place  in  the  communications  industry.  Here,  I
think for example of telecommunications, such  as  cellular,  satellite  and
computer communications.

In South Africa the growth  of  the  cellular  communications  industry  has
surpassed all expectations. These  changes  in  communications  technologies
have already had a significant impact on  many  aspects  of  life  and  have
transformed the world into a global village.

This has resulted in  improved  living  standards,  and  has  also  provided
communications  in  rural  and  other  areas  for  which   easy   forms   of
communication were previously inaccessible. Furthermore, a large portion  of
the  business  sector  relies  to  a  large   extent   on   technology   and
communications for its operations.

However, the activities of criminal organisations and  syndicates  are  also
enhanced by technology in the communications  area.  Criminal  elements  are
using all  types  of  communications  extensively,  which  include  cellular
phones, satellite-based phones, e-mail, the Internet, etc, not only  in  the
planning of crimes, but also in the perpetration of crimes such  as  highway
heists and in terrorism, often with military precision.

The interception of communications is an essential part of  dismantling  and
tackling criminal organisations and syndicates and in the  investigation  of
all kinds of smuggling, whether related  to  contraband  in  general  or  to
drugs, arms, ammunition and explosives.

In South Africa we need only think  about  illicit  drug  laboratories;  the
trafficking in drugs where South Africa is used  as  a  transit  country  to
Europe and elsewhere; and the trafficking  of  cannabis  produced  in  South
Africa and surrounding states; as well as the trafficking in drugs, such  as
Mandrax, to South Africa.

Our infrastructure also  provides  excellent  communications  facilities  to
plan and execute acts of terrorism. We know of instances in  which  cellular
phones have even been used as part of the detonation  devices  of  terrorist
bombs. Law-enforcement agencies worldwide have developed various  techniques
in  utilising  information,  such  as  call-related  information,  for   the
interception of communications.

The Interception and Monitoring Prohibition Act of  1992,  which  came  into
operation on 1 February 1993, prohibits the interception  of  communications
which are transmitted over a telecommunications line  if  such  interception
takes place intentionally and without the knowledge  or  permission  of  the
dispatcher. It also prohibits the intentional  monitoring  of  conversations
or communications so as to gather confidential  information  concerning  any
person, body or organisation.

However, provision is made for  the  interception  of  postal  articles  and
communications and for the monitoring of conversations or communications  in
cases of serious offences or if the security of the Republic is threatened.

As  a  result  of  the  technological  developments  in  the  communications
industries,  which  I  have  referred  to,  the  existing  Interception  and
Monitoring Prohibition Act of 1992 has  become  wholly  inadequate  to  cope
with modern circumstances. Furthermore, since that Act came  into  operation
there  have  been  considerable  legal  developments  throughout  the  world
regarding the interception and monitoring  of  communications,  developments
influenced by technology and financial considerations. It also became  clear
that if the existing interception powers  of  law-enforcement  agencies  are
not to be seriously handicapped by the growth of new technologies, it  would
be necessary to extend the scope of the  existing  interception  legislation
in order to include all types of communications.

If the power of law-enforcement agencies to intercept communications is  not
extended to include all modern types of  communications,  there  is  a  risk
that any criminally minded individual  could  use  a  communications  method
which falls outside the  ambit  of  the  existing  Act,  thereby  making  it
difficult, if not impossible, for law enforcement to lawfully intercept  his
or her communications. For example, the use  of  encryption  technology  may
place criminal communications beyond the reach of law-enforcement  agencies.
These circumstances  led  to  the  SA  Law  Commission  being  requested  to
investigate the Interception and Monitoring Prohibition Act of 1992 as  part
of its review of security legislation.

The Interception and Monitoring Bill of 2001, as  originally  introduced  to
Parliament,  emanated  from  the  SA  Law  Commission's   report   on   that
investigation. The Bill  is,  to  a  large  extent,  based  on  interception
legislation of countries such as  the  United  States  of  America,  Canada,
Australia and the United Kingdom. The principle object of  the  Bill  is  to
provide a comprehensive framework for the  interception  of  communications,
the monitoring of signals and radio frequency spectrums  and  the  provision
of communication-related information.

The Bill has been drafted in such a manner  that  it  covers  all  currently
known types of communications and it also attempts  to  provide  for  future
developments. The Bill makes provision for proper co-operation  between  the
law-enforcement agencies and certain key groups in the business sector,  for
example telecommunications service providers such as  Telkom,  MTN,  Cell  C
and Vodacom, and Internet service providers and postal service providers  in
respect of the interception of communications. However, it is expected  that
other groups will  be  affected  in  the  longer  term  as  innovations  are
introduced in the communications market.

Syndicates and organised crime pose a serious threat not only to the  safety
of our community,  but  also  to  the  public  health  or  safety,  national
security and compelling national economic interests of the Republic.  It  is
for  that  reason  that  this  piece  of  legislation  affirms  Government's
intolerance in respect of the  commission  of  serious  offences  and  other
organised criminal activities committed by syndicates  and  organised  crime
members, and provides, as far as possible, law-enforcement agencies  with  a
powerful and effective tool in combating  serious  crime  and  investigating
threats to the public health or  safety,  national  security  or  compelling
national economic interests of the Republic.
I would like to make use of this opportunity to  thank  the  chairperson  of
the select committee, Kgoshi Mokoena, and the members of that committee  for
the hard work they have done in considering this legislation.

I have noted the amendments to the Bill which  are  being  proposed  in  the
select committee's report on the Bill. I am particularly  delighted  to  see
that some of those amendments attempt to address a major concern  among  the
telecommunications service providers, namely that, for instance,  clause  30
of  the  Bill  could  be  interpreted  as   empowering   the   Minister   of
Communications to prescribe to them the specific brands,  designs  or  types
of facilities and devices to be acquired or systems to be used.

I am personally convinced that the proposed amendments make  it  clear  that
it is  not  Government's  intention  to  interfere  with  telecommunications
service providers' discretion relating to  the  brand,  design  or  type  of
facilities and devices that they want to acquire or the  systems  that  they
want to use, as long as such facilities, devices  and  systems  comply  with
all the requirements of the law-enforcement agencies.

I want  to  conclude  by  remarking  that  the  theory  that  crime  follows
opportunity has  become  established  wisdom  in  criminology.  One  of  the
fundamental principles of crime prevention, to  which  this  Bill  seeks  to
give effect, is to reduce such opportunity. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, the question of crime is a worrying  factor
in any society. When technology advances, criminals also use the  very  same
technology to commit crime. What worries some of us is that these  criminals
have gone further by using our kids at school in committing some of  crimes.
As Government there is no way we can allow these criminals  to  commit  this
crime. In one way or another we have to  flush  them  out.  Let  us  do  it,
because we can.

This final draft of the Bill came about as  a  result  of  the  efforts  and
contributions of many people, for example  service  providers,  departments,
individuals and many other stakeholders. I have heard some of my  colleagues
- committee chairpersons - complaining in the corridors that, at  times,  it
was very difficult to get hold  of  their  Ministers  when  they  needed  to
consult them.

I am happy to  announce  in  this  House  that  my  magnificent,  evergreen,
calculated, cool and dynamic Minister has always been available when I  need
him. [Interjections.] [Laughter.] At times, I  would  call  him  at  awkward
hours, but he was still able to give me educated advice. I say thank you  to
the Minister. Oh what a leader! He is a leader who knows the way,  goes  the
way and shows the way.

Here is a Bill  before  us  which  seeks  to  counter  any  wrong  moves  by
criminals. The Interception and Monitoring Bill, as it  is  commonly  known,
has come  about  as  a  result  of  technological  advances  in  respect  of
telecommunications, such as cellular  phones  and  satellites,  as  well  as
computer communications  through  e-mail  and  the  electronic  transfer  of
information and data.

Members will remember that in 1992 the South African Government passed  into
law the Interception and Monitoring Prohibition Act, Act 127 of  1992.  This
Act prohibited the interception and monitoring of communications without  an
order of a judge. It focused  primarily  on  telephone  communications,  but
also provided for the interception of monitoring of postal communications.

This Bill aims to regulate the authorised  monitoring  and  interception  of
communications, particularly with  respect  to  the  Internet  and  cellular
networks. It further provides that no service  provider  shall  provide  any
telecommunications  service  which  does  not  have  the  capacity   to   be
monitored.

The Bill also states that  service  providers  must  acquire  the  necessary
facilities and devices to enable the monitoring of communications  in  terms
of this Bill. Obviously, the costs incurred  in  acquiring  such  equipment,
the technical maintenance thereof and the continued operating costs, are  to
be borne by the communications service provider.
There was some uncertainty about an individual's right to privacy  in  terms
of this Bill. There  is  no  need  to  panic.  Law-enforcement  agencies  or
officials will not just intercept or  monitor  without  authorisation  by  a
judge. There are some steps to be taken before  intercepting  or  monitoring
can take place. But let us be realistic. What would be  the  use  of  having
such a piece of legislation if perpetrators will have to be told that  their
communications are being  intercepted  or  monitored?  That  would  be  like
making a scary face at a baby.

This Bill makes it explicitly clear that an individual's  right  to  privacy
will be respected, and will only be infringed under specific and  compelling
circumstances. Owing to the fact that  there  have  also  been  considerable
legal developments throughout  the  world  regarding  the  interception  and
monitoring   of   communications,   telecommunications   are   being    used
increasingly in the commission of especially organised crime, in heists  and
in other serious violent crimes, as my hon Minister has said.

Therefore, the limitations envisaged in the Bill  will  in  no  way  deprive
South Africans of their privacy, but will be a signal to criminals that  our
Government will be able to monitor  criminals  who  use  telecommunications,
such as cellular and satellite communications, and the  electronic  transfer
of information and data as their forms of communication.

The  Bill  also  requires  that  telecommunications  and   Internet   access
companies positively identify and keep proper  records  of  all  clients  to
whom a telecommunications service is  provided.  This  information  will  be
made available to the  law-enforcement  officials  when  required.  Criminal
sanctions will apply for failing to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  this
Bill.

At the same time, no  service  provider  should  make  information  of  this
nature available without having the necessary documentation  or  application
presented by law-enforcement officials.

We support the view that service providers  develop  privacy  policies  that
clearly state to their customers under  what  conditions  their  information
privacy rights will be violated, providing that the necessary  documentation
and  procedures  are  complied  with.  Under  circumstances  in   which   an
individual intercepts or monitors a communication  in  accordance  with  the
directive issued under the Act, he or she will not be guilty of  an  offence
and should be indemnified from any action taken by the customer against  him
or her.

We are dealing with a very complicated issue in this Bill,  for  example  as
to how law-enforcement officials make oral application for interception  and
monitoring. After having done that, they must,  after  12  hours,  submit  a
written application. Interestingly, the judge can also give  oral  direction
and allow interception and monitoring to  be  carried  out.  This  can  only
happen in the case of an emergency.

There was a concern that this Bill puts a  heavy  burden  on  small  service
providers in rural areas who will be expected to have all the necessary  and
sophisticated equipment, as required by this  Bill.  They  need  not  panic,
because that has been taken care of. There is a provision for  the  Minister
to exempt them from meeting some of the requirements. To add to  that,  even
tried and tested service providers can also apply  or  ask  to  be  exempted
from some of these requirements.

I want briefly to touch on the famous clause  30.  After  long  discussions,
wide  consultation  and  interaction  with  service  providers   and   other
stakeholders, this clause is now crafted in  such  a  way  that  it  is  now
acceptable to all parties. Unlike before, the Minister will  only  prescribe
the security and technical and functional  requirements  of  the  facilities
and devices to be acquired in terms of this Bill.

This is one of those substantial amendments we are effecting in  this  Bill.
What we need is for all devices  that  are  going  to  be  used  by  service
providers to be interceptible in accordance with the  requirements  set  out
in this Bill. This was not easy, but we managed. It was taxing  but  we  did
not lose hope. All peace-loving South Africans will understand  and  support
this Bill.

Let  us  allow  law-enforcement  officials  to  implement  this   piece   of
legislation by passing this  Bill.  I  extend  a  word  of  appreciation  to
colleagues  in  this  committee.  As  usual,   and   always,   in   whatever
deliberations we engaged in, they put their country,  South  Africa,  first.
It is not surprising for me to say that I am very  proud  of  them.  We  are
going to support this Bill. [Applause.]

Ms J L KGOALI: Hon Chairperson, thank you for  the  opportunity  to  address
this House. Hon Minister and colleagues, the Regulation of  Interception  of
Communications and Provision of Communication-related Information Bill  that
we are debating today will play a crucial role in strengthening the hand  of
our  law-enforcement  agencies  in  combating  criminal  activities  in  our
country.

Whilst it is not clear how many interception warrants were issued  in  terms
of the 1992 Act or how many persons  were  arrested  who  were  involved  in
serious crime, one can only assume that some arrests did occur.

This Bill will help to maintain interception  as  a  powerful  tool  in  our
armoury against crime, and will help to ensure  stability  in  the  country.
Unfortunately, those who drafted this law some 10  years  ago  did  not  and
could  not  have  foreseen  the  extraordinary  pace  of   change   in   the
communications industry, especially in the past decade.

We are faced with a  revolutionised  communications  industry  and  outdated
legislation on interception. It is true that criminals have  been  quick  to
put the  new  technology  to  use  with  detrimental  consequences  for  our
country. Hence, there was a need to revise the current Act  if  we  were  to
preserve the ability of our law-enforcement  and  intelligence  services  to
prevent and detect organised  crime  and  other  cases  of  serious  violent
crime.

When this Bill was first released  for  public  comment,  many  people  were
alarmed. They argued, and some still do, that this Bill would  lead  to  the
invasion of their constitutionally protected right to privacy. The  fact  is
that this Bill is not intended to do  something  that  is  wrong  for  South
Africans but, rather, to protect them. It is also not intended to  create  a
Big-Brother-is-watching scenario. Far from  that.  The  Bill  is  about  the
regulation  of  the  monitoring  and  interception  of  communications  from
whatever source they  may  come,  be  they  from  the  state  or  a  private
individual.

This Bill is about the establishment of a proper legal framework within  the
constitutional obligation of the state to help to detect and prevent  crime,
and this can only be done within the confines of the Bill of Rights.

As far as the ANC is  concerned,  the  need  to  protect  fundamental  human
rights was seen as just as important as  the  need  to  change  the  current
outdated legislation.

While the revolution  in  communications  technology  was  one  of  the  key
motivations behind the decision to change the law, so too was  the  need  to
protect fundamental human rights, particularly the  right  to  privacy,  not
forgetting that it is this very ANC  that  has  made  it  possible  for  all
people in this country to have their  rights  respected.  However,  we  also
want to make sure that they do not violate their rights themselves.

This principle was uppermost in our minds when we  deliberated  on  the  new
Bill. This  is  because,  as  an  organisation,  we  are  committed  to  the
protection  of  human  rights.  We  believe  that  the  unchecked   use   of
interception can have consequences for the rights of individuals.

With this Bill we intend putting interception on a statutory  footing  which
will stand the test  of  constitutionality.  We  seek  to  ensure  that  the
privacy of those who use communication networks is respected and  that  they
have a means of redress if their communications are intercepted  unlawfully.


What needs to be noted - and I am sure hon members even from the  opposition
parties, particularly the DP which is the party that makes a  lot  of  noise
at times - is that the efforts that have been made by the  Justice  Ministry
and  its  department  involved  their  carefully  applying  their  minds  to
addressing the gaps, while, at the same time, strengthening  the  number  of
independent  safeguards  contained  in  the  Interception   and   Monitoring
Prohibition Act of 1992.

What  is  also  important  is  that  each  interception  direction  must  be
authorised by a designated judge, and this judge must be satisfied that  the
granting of an interception direction  is  strictly  necessary.  Apart  from
needing approval by a judge to  intercept  communication,  the  interception
agency is also subjected to tough scrutiny. The designated judge  may,  from
time to time, request the interception agency to provide  him  or  her  with
reports on the progress that has been made towards achieving the  objectives
for which the interception direction was granted.

What is also important is that if the interception agency  fails  to  submit
such progress reports, or the judge is satisfied that  the  objectives  have
been achieved for which the direction was issued, or the  grounds  on  which
the interception direction was  issued  no  longer  exist,  the  judge  must
cancel the interception direction.

This Bill is  not  intended  to  allow  people  to  listen  to  any  private
conversation between two people. It is their right to communicate, but  they
must do so rightfully. However, the Bill makes it a  punishable  offence  to
do so if they are not communicating correctly. The Bill  also  ensures  that
interception  directions  or  entry  warrants  may  only  be  issued  by   a
designated judge.  I  am  emphasising  this  so  that  people  do  not  feel
threatened that their rights may be impeded.

Lastly, if one does the right thing, one need not fear.  If  one  does  not,
one must watch out. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the Constitution sets  out  a  number  of  rights
that are enshrined and that  enjoy  different  degrees  of  protection.  The
right to life, for example, is an absolute right. By contrast, the right  to
freedom is qualified in the sense that if a person commits  a  crime  he  or
she may forfeit the right to freedom after due process in a court of law.

Section 14 of the Constitution provides that:


  Everyone has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have -


  (a) their person or home searched;
  (b) their property searched;
  (c) their possessions seized; or
  (d) the privacy of their communications infringed.

In a perfect world, where everyone is a  responsible,  law-abiding  citizen,
the right to privacy would also be an absolute  right.  Sadly  this  is  not
true, as is evidenced by the recent series of  bomb  blasts  in  Soweto  and
Bronkhorstspruit.

In a country such as  ours,  where  every  person  has  protected  political
rights,  these  bomb  blasts  are  nothing  less  than  an   attack   on   a
constitutional  state.  In  other  words,  our  very  foundation  is   being
attacked. As a nation that  has  enshrined  freedom  and  democracy  in  our
Constitution, we not only have a right, but  also  a  duty  to  protect  and
defend our Constitution.

The question then becomes:  How  do  we  protect  our  rights  and  freedoms
without slipping from a free democracy into a controlled  police  state?  In
this regard the Constitution gives some guidance  in  section  36(1),  which
provides:


  The rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited only in terms of  law  of
  general application to the extent that the limitation is  reasonable  and
  justifiable in an open and democratic society  based  on  human  dignity,
  equality and freedom, taking  into  account  all  the  relevant  factors,
  including -


  (a) the nature of the right;
  (b) the importance of the purpose of the limitation;
  (c) the nature and extent of the limitation;
  (d) the relationship between the limitation and its purpose; and
  (e) less restrictive means to achieve the purpose.

This is the test that the Regulation of Interception of  Communications  and
Provision of Communication-related Information Bill has to stand up to.  The
Bill prohibits all unlawful interceptions of  communications,  with  certain
well-defined exceptions.

Clauses 16, 17 and 18 of  the  Bill  provide  that  an  application  for  an
interception direction, a real-time  communication-related  direction  or  a
combined order must be a written application to a designated  judge.  Clause
19  provides  that  an  application   for   archived   communication-related
direction  must  be  made  to  a  judge  or  a  magistrate.  All  of   these
applications have fairly stringent requirements. The applicant will have  to
satisfy the designated judicial officer that there  are  reasonable  grounds
to believe that a serious offence has been or will probably be committed.

My party has  some  reservations  about  this  Bill.  The  main  concern  is
contained in clauses  30(4)  and  30(5),  which  require  telecommunications
service  providers  to  secure  the   equipment   necessary   to   intercept
communications at their own expense. One of the reasons why we  are  against
this is that the cost will simply be passed on to consumers at  the  end  of
the day.

Finally, this Bill enables the state to combat crime and  terrorism.  It  is
necessary to protect our freedom. Despite the reservation referred  to,  the
DP believes that this Bill does stand up to the test set out in  section  36
of the Constitution and the DP therefore supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, I think it is time  for  that  hon  member  to
wake up and listen. [Laughter.]

I, and my team of experts, Archie and them, thought,  before  debating  this
Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-
related Information Bill, that my capable chairperson, in  conjunction  with
with my capable Minister, would have touched on a number of issues that  are
contained in this particular Bill.

The question is: If we are to debate it and we do not want  to  repeat  what
they have said, what is it that we need to say? The advice  I  received  was
that it would be imperative that we  should  refresh  the  memories  of  the
Chairperson, Minister and members on the following. Firstly,  on  25  August
1998 a restaurant called  Planet  Hollywood  was  bombed.  Two  people  were
killed and 26 injured. On 28 January 1999 there was an explosion  outside  a
police station injuring 11 persons. On 9 May 1999 a car bomb again  exploded
outside a police station, and on 29 November 1999  a  crowded  pizzeria  was
bombed, injuring 46 people. A  four-year-old  girl  had  to  have  her  foot
amputated and a 20-year-old woman - very young - lost a leg. I was  informed
that this bomb had been set off by means of a cellphone.

Together with my team, we are of the opinion that without our  sophisticated
telecommunications network, cellphones, etc, those criminals would not  have
succeeded. We as Government, as the  state,  might  have  been  able  to  do
something to prevent some of these crimes.

I thought that I should pause, but let me proceed to  refresh  hon  members'
memories. In August 1996 an amount of R21 million was stolen at  a  cash-in-
transit depot in Pinetown near Durban. In 1997 an amount of R12 million  was
stolen from a cash depot in Pretoria, and in July 1997 an  amount  of  R17,4
million was stolen from a security van in Bronkhorstspruit. These  are  just
a few of the incidents I thought I should mention to  refresh  hon  members'
memory. Last month, in October 2002, a  series  of  bomb  explosions  rocked
Soweto, killing one person and critically injuring  another.  Railway  lines
and places of worship were affected.

In all these incidents people were injured  and  others  lost  their  lives.
Therefore I think that as a democratic state, under the  leadership  of  the
ANC, we have a responsibility to prevent crime and  to  protect  our  people
from the perpetrators of these violent  acts.  What  we  therefore  seek  to
achieve through passing this Bill is to intercept communications  so  as  to
prevent crime and to assist all of us as South Africans to investigate  what
has happened and what is to happen.

Lastly, this Bill prohibits any unauthorised persons from  intercepting  any
communications in the course of transmission. The  hon  Lever,  the  learned
one, referred us to certain sections of the Constitution, and  I  appreciate
that. It is therefore not opening the door to every Tom, Dick and  Harry  to
intercept communications. It does not do that.

It is not the responsibility of the Minister of Justice, Kgoshi  Mokoena  or
this House to assist in combating crime, but the responsibility of each  and
every South African. That includes the private sector.

If the DP says to us that they have problems with  clause  30(4),  are  they
saying to us that those telecommunications service providers do not  have  a
responsibility to their customers - to me, for one, as I have  a  very  nice
cellphone, and hon members? Do they not have a responsibility to assist  the
state in ensuring that at the end of the day we bring  all  those  criminals
to book? [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Mnr die Voorsitter, misdaad, soos armoede, werkloosheid  en
MIV/vigs, is sonder twyfel een van die grootste  probleme,  indien  nie  diÃ©
grootste nie, wat ons land en die Suid-Afrikaanse nasie in die gesig  staar.
Ten spyte daarvan dat ons daarin slaag om die  vlak  van  sekere  kategorieÃ«
misdaad te stabiliseer en diÃ© van sommige tipes selfs te laat daal,  is  die
vlak van die meeste kategorieÃ« misdaad in ons land veels te hoog  en  steeds
geheel en al onaanvaarbaar.

Dit is daarom die plig en verantwoordelikheid van elke Suid-Afrikaner,  soos
die vorige spreker gesÃª het,  en  elke  Suid-Afrikaanse  onderneming  om  in
hulle eie belang en in die belang van ons land en al  sy  mense  daadwerklik
betrokke te raak, en te bly, by die  voorkoming  en  bekamping  van  hierdie
smet van misdaad in ons samelewing om te  verhoed  dat  dit  die  vreedsame,
vooruitstrewende en veilige toekoms van ons en al  ons  kinders  in  hierdie
potensieel beste land ter wÃªreld vernietig. Dit vra  egter  opofferings  van
almal,  en   in   hierdie   geval   ook   van   die   diensverskaffers   van
telekommunikasiedienste. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Mr  Chairperson,  crime,  like  poverty,  unemployment  and
HIV/Aids, is without a doubt one  of  the  greatest  problems,  if  not  the
greatest one, facing our country and the South African nation.  Despite  the
fact that we have succeeded in stabilising the level of  certain  categories
of crime and that some types have even  been  reduced,  the  level  of  most
categories of crime in our country is much too  high  and  still  completely
unacceptable.

Therefore, it is the duty and responsibility of every South African, as  the
previous speaker said, as well as every South African enterprise, and it  is
in their own interests as well as the interests of our country and  all  its
people, to become and to remain actively  involved  in  the  prevention  and
combating of this blot of crime on our society in order to prevent  it  from
destroying the peaceful, progressive and safe future of ours and of all  our
children in this, potentially the best country in the world.  However,  this
demands sacrifices of  us  all,  and  in  this  case  also  of  the  service
providers of telecommunications services.]

Telecommunications are being  used  increasingly  in  the  organisation  and
commission of especially organised crime, heists and other  serious  violent
crimes. Unless the communication between members of crime syndicates can  be
intercepted and monitored effectively, we shall not be able to  prevent  and
combat the crimes being committed  by  them.  In  fact,  as  the  levels  of
communication between  criminals  improve,  so  the  levels  of  crime  will
escalate. It is therefore of the  utmost  importance  that  our  police  and
intelligence services be empowered to enable them effectively  to  intercept
and monitor the conversations between criminals.

This Bill, as we have heard, imposes  certain  duties  on  telecommunication
service providers and other persons, and  the  example  referred  to  by  Mr
Lever as well as the previous speaker. True to their philosophy of  standing
on the sidewalks and criticising and saying the things they  think  will  be
popular among the voters without ever accepting  any  co-responsibility  for
anything in this country and wanting  the  Government  alone  to  be  solely
responsible for the prevention and combating of crime,  the  eradication  of
poverty and other major challenges being faced by our  country,  the  DP  in
the committee opposed this clause; just as they have  indicated  today  they
still have reservations about it, because they want the Government  to  bear
the costs on their own.

This is the same DP philosophy which made the  DP  member  of  the  National
Assembly, Mrs Sono, say in that House last Thursday in a debate on  poverty,
inter alia, that the alleviation of poverty was the task of the  Government,
of the executive, not of Parliament. ``When the Government fails, as it  has
done, it is Parliament's task to  tell  Government  and  also  to  tell  the
people that the Government has failed''.

But co-responsibility coming from them? Never! [Interjections.] This  is  in
line with a statement by one of their senior leaders: ``What is bad for  the
country is good for the DA.''

We in the New NP, together with the Government and all  South  Africans  and
South African businesses who want to find solutions  to  the  challenges  of
crime and poverty, accept co-responsibility for finding solutions  to  these
problems and helping to address these  problems  in  the  interests  of  all
South Africans. We are satisfied that we have in this committee,  under  the
leadership of our chairperson, been  able  to  strike  the  correct  balance
between what is required to be done by the service  providers  and  what  is
required to be done by the Government.

We therefore have no hesitation in supporting this Bill, and we request  all
South Africans and all businesses in this country to support this,  and  not
only to support this Bill, but to support the efforts to  curb  and  prevent
crime in this country; to eradicate poverty and to  address  all  the  major
challenges that we are faced with as South Africans together. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  while  we  as
the ANC recognise  that  the  interception  of  communication  is  a  highly
intrusive activity which affects the privacy of the individual,  we  believe
equally strongly that this Bill strikes  the  correct  balance  between  the
need to intercept communication and the  right  to  privacy.  The  right  to
privacy is established by section 14 of our  Constitution,  which,  however,
also  recognises  that  this  right  is  not  absolute,   that   there   are
circumstances in which it might be necessary for the  state  to  limit  this
right.

Since the 1993 Act was enacted there  have  been  enormous  changes  in  the
telecommunications and postal market in South Africa, and a great  expansion
in the nature and range  of  services  available.  There  are  a  number  of
examples which indicate the extent to which  communications  have  developed
in our country.

Firstly, Telkom is currently the only  telecommunications  company  offering
fixed-line services. This is going to change soon  when  another  fixed-line
operator will be  announced.  Secondly,  the  cellphone  industry  in  South
Africa, which was virtually unheard of a few years ago, has  also  developed
to such an extent that we now have three operators which  have  hundreds  of
thousands of subscribers. The numbers of these subscribers  are  continually
growing.

Thirdly, the satellite telephone market, while it is still in  its  infancy,
will evolve rapidly in the next few years. Fourthly, communications via  the
Internet or e-mail have grown dramatically in the past few  years  and  this
part of the market also continues to grow. It is estimated  that  there  are
close to 2,4 million Internet users currently in this country. Finally,  the
postal sector has also developed rapidly with a huge growth  in  the  number
of companies offering parcel and document delivery services.

We need to  update  our  interception  law  to  provide  a  clear  statutory
framework for authorising the disclosure of data held by  telecommunications
service providers. The  Bill  therefore  provides  that  no  person,  postal
service provider, telecommunications  service  provider  or  decryption  key
holder may disclose any information obtained in terms of the Bill.

The only times such information can be disclosed are  when  the  information
is required for evidence in court, investigation of  a  criminal  proceeding
or when it is required for the performance of  functions  in  terms  of  the
Bill.

This is clearly in line with our commitment to upholding the  right  not  to
have personal information disclosed and to restricting, as far as  possible,
an intrusion into the right to privacy. The Bill does not,  as  many  others
have  pointed   out,   provide   for   the   willy-nilly   interception   of
communications. The communications must be justified in terms of the  strict
criteria which have been laid down in clause 16(5) of the Bill.

Our message as the ANC has been constant over the years  and  we  repeat  it
now, that together with  the  private  sector  and  every  citizen  of  this
country we shall continue to fight crime so that we are able to  provide  an
environment that is conducive to prosperity in this  country.  We  therefore
support the Bill as laid down before us.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  I
rise essentially to thank hon members for what I think has been a very  good
debate on an otherwise very complex and technical Bill.  I  am  particularly
happy that all speakers have spoken in favour of the Bill.

I know and accept that interception and monitoring, by  their  very  nature,
are very intrusive. At the same time,  of  course,  I  am  able  to  say  to
members  of  the  public  that  we  are  not  interested  in  any   personal
information. Therefore, the details regarding who sleeps  with  whom,  where
and when are of no interest to us.  [Laughter.]  One  can  communicate  with
whomever one wants to as far as those personal  matters  of  the  heart  are
concerned. We are not interested in them at all.

I am, indeed, intrigued by the reservations expressed by the hon  member  Mr
Lever on behalf of the DP regarding clauses 30(4) and 30(5) of the  Bill.  I
will illustrate my surprise by using one or two analogies.

When a person wants to operate a taxi  service  anywhere  in  the  Republic,
they must first and foremost have a licence to do so. In order for  them  to
get a licence, they have to comply with certain basic requirements  such  as
providing a serviceable and roadworthy motor vehicle. None of them has  come
to the Department of Transport and said: ``I want this licence  and  to  get
this licence I have to comply with these requirements. But in order  for  me
to comply with these requirements,  I  want  the  state  to  buy  the  motor
vehicle for me.'' That does not happen. We do not buy spaza shops for  spaza
shop operators, we do not set up taverns  for  tavern  operators,  etc.  Why
should we do so in this instance? That is the question we all ought to  ask.
We told the industry that we were not going to do that.

There are  two  types  of  cost  in  that  regard.  The  first  one  is  the
operational cost which we bear. When we do an interception we bear the  cost
ourselves. But, the second type of cost, namely the cost  that  people  need
to bear in order  to  comply  with  the  basic  requirements  of  this  law,
obviously and logically ought to be borne  by  those  who  want  to  provide
services in this industry.

I do not think that Mr Mpahlwa and  his  department  are  sitting  on  large
bucketsful of money that they dish out to people who want to participate  in
this industry. Even if they were, we would tell them it is not right  to  do
so unless one is able to offer the same kind of assistance  to  all  service
providers in all  industries.  And  we  are  not  doing  that  in  any  area
whatsoever, and we shall not make any exceptions.

I am not going to enter into the fray between them and our allies,  the  New
NP, except that I am quite excited that they are  now  fighting.  They  were
involved in a very unnatural dalliance in the  post-1999  elections  period,
but, I must say, that has come to an end. They now have a  very  interesting
fight between themselves. [Interjections.] We will watch  the  fight.  Maybe
that hon member should fight back; face them. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.
                      INSOLVENCY SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

      (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee thereon)

UMntwana B Z ZULU: Sihlalo namalungu ahloniphekile ...  [Prince  B  Z  Zulu:
Chairperson and hon members ... ]

... one has to look at the latest amendment to the  Insolvency  Act  against
the background of our Government's commitment to promoting greater  economic
growth within the framework of sound industrial relations.  This  commitment
requires that the Government strike the right balance between  the  need  to
create the conditions for accelerated economic growth and the  need  to  put
in place sufficient safeguards to protect the interests of workers.

It is an unfortunate reality of all competitive  and  open-market  economies
that companies do not  always  retain  their  liquidity.  Liquidation  of  a
company can have severe consequences for workers, particularly in  the  form
of job losses.

Our current insolvency laws do not provide adequate protection  for  workers
in order to mitigate the losses that they have to bear in the event  of  the
liquidation of  their  employer.  Employers  often  do  not  inform  workers
timeously of the potential  liquidation.  In  fact,  notice  of  provisional
liquidation applications are rarely served on workers, with most only  being
informed once the provisional  order  has  been  granted.  This  is  because
neither employees nor their trade union have any right  to  be  notified  of
legal proceedings which may result in the insolvency of their employer.

The Bill attempts to address these shortcomings by giving procedural  rights
to employees of insolvent employers or their representatives, such as  their
trade unions, to be notified of the  institution  of  legal  proceedings  to
sequestrate or liquidate an employer.

The proposed amendment relates to section 4,9 and 11 of the Insolvency  Act.
In terms thereof a right is created for employees and their trade unions  to
receive notice of proceedings and to be served with any order issued by  the
court where there are voluntary or compulsory sequestration  or  liquidation
proceedings. The person  bringing  the  application  is,  in  terms  of  the
proposed amendment, obliged to serve a copy of the notice on any  registered
trade union that represents the employees of that employer,  and  must  also
display a copy thereof on the  employer's  premises  in  a  place  to  which
employees have access. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

                  ADMINISTRATION OF ESTATES AMENDMENT BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report by Select Committee on Security and
                       Constitutional Affairs thereon)
Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, will you allow me to  present  the  hon  Mr
Horne's speech on his behalf?  He  had  to  leave  the  Council  because  of
unforeseen circumstances.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Continue,  hon
member.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on his behalf ...

Artikel 23(7)(a) van Wet 38 van 1927 het bepaal  dat  ten  opsigte  van  die
boedel van enige swart persoon wat gesterf het sonder 'n geldige  testament,
die aanstelling van 'n eksekuteur nie nodig was nie, omdat die  Meester  van
die HoÃ«rhof  nie  enige  magte  het  ten  opsigte  van  die  bereddering  en
verdeling van sodanige boedel nie.

In die saak van Moseneke v die Meester het die  Konstitusionele  Hof  bevind
dat hierdie artikel ongrondwetlik en ongeldig  is  met  onmiddellike  effek.
Die Konstitusionele Hof het ook bevind dat regulasie 3(1) van  R200  in  die
Staatskoerant nommer 10601 van  6  Februarie  1987  ongeldig  is,  maar  het
hierdie bevel van ongeldigheid opgeskort tot 6 Desember 2002.

Die Konstitusionele Hof het beveel dat  die  regulasie  geÃ¯nterpreteer  moet
word om te beteken dat begunstigdes van 'n boedel van  'n  afgestorwe  swart
persoon  kan  kies  om  die  boedel  aan  'n  landdros  of  die  Meester  te
rapporteer. Die  rapportering  van  sodanige  intestate  boedels  van  swart
persone was voorheen beperk tot landdroskantore. Die hof het beklemtoon  dat
die besluit net betrekking het op boedels wat onder die  gemenereg  val,  en
nie boedels wat in gevolge die gewoontereg vererf is nie.

Die SA Regskommissie het amptelik hulle ondersoek  na  die  gewoontereg  ten
opsigte van erfopvolging afgehandel,  maar  hulle  aanbevelings  in  hierdie
verband  sal  nie  betyds  beskikbaar  wees  om  die   sperdatum   van   die
Konstitusionele Hof te  haal  nie.  Die  reg  van  erfopvolging  bepaal  die
begunstigdes van 'n bestorwe boedel en hulle regte,  terwyl  die  reÃ«ls  met
betrekking  tot  die  bereddering  van  boedels  die  prosedures   vir   die
bereddering daarvan voorskryf. Met ander woorde: Hoe om  die  krediteure  te
betaal en die voordele aan die begunstigdes oor te dra.

Ingevolge  die  gewoontereg,  waar  'n  begunstigde  die  posisie  van   die
oorledene inneem, is daar geen duidelike onderskeid  tussen  die  reÃ«ls  vir
die bereddering van boedels en die reÃ«ls van erfopvolging nie.  Hangend  die
finalisering van die SA Regskommissie se  hersiening  van  die  gewoontereg,
word geen veranderings  voorgestel  ten  opsigte  van  die  bereddering  van
boedels wat ingevolge die gewoontereg vererf nie.

Die Konstitusionele Hof het in die Moseneke-saak ten besluite gesÃª  dat  die
voordele van die bereddering van  bestorwe  boedels  deur  landdroste,  soos
gerief en lae  koste,  ook  bereik  kan  word  deur  'n  nie-diskriminerende
bepaling.  Na  sorgvuldige  oorweging  van  al  die  moontlikhede,  het  die
Departement van Justisie en  Staatkundige  Ontwikkeling  besluit  die  beste
manier om die voordele van sentrale rekords en beheer te  bereik,  sowel  as
die toeganklikheid deur en bystand vir  persone  op  grondvlak,  is  om  die
bereddering van alle boedels onder die beheer  van  die  Meester  te  plaas,
maar om sekere dienspunte aan te wys waar beamptes van die  departement  die
nodige funksies ten opsigte van die bereddering  van  boedels  sal  uitoefen
namens, en onder beheer van, die Meester.

Klousule 1 van hierdie wetsontwerp stel 'n nuwe artikel 2A vir  Wet  66  van
1965 voor om hiervoor  voorsiening  te  maak.  As  'n  tussentydse  maatreÃ«l
totdat die SA Regskommissie se hersiening van die  gewoontereg  ten  opsigte
van erfopvolging afgehandel is, word voorgestel dat alle  bestorwe  boedels,
wat nie volgens die  gewoontereg  vererf  nie,  onder  die  beheer  van  die
Meester beredder moet word. Hierdie wetsontwerp maak dit  duidelik  dat  die
Meester geen jurisdiksie of funksie sal hÃª ten opsigte van bestorwe  boedels
wat volgens die gewoontereg vererf nie.

ReÃ«lings sal getref word vir die herroeping van die voormelde  regulasie  om
saam te val met die inwerkingtreding van hierdie  wetsontwerp.  Gebaseer  op
die statistiek en inligting vanaf beamptes wat tans die funksie ten  opsigte
van die bereddering van boedels by  landdroskantore  hanteer,  sal  beamptes
aangewys word by dienspunte om  nie-nodige  magte  en  funksies  namens,  en
onder beheer van, die Meester uit te oefen.

Hierdie beamptes sal byvoorbeeld aanstellings kan maak in  toepaslike  klein
boedels, vergaderings van begunstigdes kan hou en bystand  kan  verleen  met
die afhandeling van klein  boedels.  In  sommige  gevalle  sal  hulle  bloot
dokumente deurgee na die Meester en  behulpsaam  wees  met  navrae.  Hierdie
wetsontwerp gee uitvoering aan die uitspraak van  die  Konstitusionele  Hof,
en raak nou ontslae van 'n artikel van die bestaande wet wat  neergekom  het
op diskriminasie op grond van velkleur.

Die komitee het die wetsontwerp eenparig gesteun,  en  ek  vra  nou  hierdie
Raad om dieselfde te doen. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Section 23(7)(a) of Act 38 of  1927  provided  that,  with  regard  to  the
estate of any black person who died without a valid  will,  the  appointment
of an executor was not necessary because the Master of the  High  Court  did
not have any powers with regard to the administration and division  of  such
estate.

In the case of Moseneke v the Master, the Constitutional  Court  found  that
this section was unconstitutional and invalid  with  immediate  effect.  The
Constitutional Court also found that regulation 3(1) of R200 in  Gazette  No
10601  of  6  February  1987  was  invalid,  but  suspended  this  order  of
invalidity until 6 December 2002.

The Constitutional Court ordered that the regulation should  be  interpreted
to mean that beneficiaries of an estate  of  a  deceased  black  person  can
choose to report the estate to a magistrate or the Master. The reporting  of
such  intestate  estates  of  black  people  was  previously  restricted  to
magistrates' offices. The court emphasised that their decision only  applied
to estates which fell under common law, and not estates  devolved  according
to customary law.

The  SA  Law  Commission  officially  concluded  their  investigation   into
customary law with regard to succession, but their recommendations  in  this
regard will not be available in time  to  reach  the  cut-off  date  of  the
Constitutional Court. The law of succession determines the beneficiaries  of
a deceased estate and their rights, while  the  rules  with  regard  to  the
administration of estates prescribe the procedures  for  the  administration
thereof. In other words: How to  pay  the  creditors  and  to  transfer  the
benefits to the beneficiaries.

In terms of customary law, where a beneficiary takes  the  position  of  the
deceased,  there  is  no  clear  distinction  between  the  rules  for   the
administration  of  estates  and  the  rules  for  succession.  Pending  the
finalisation of the SA Law Commission's review of customary law, no  changes
are proposed with regard to  the  administration  of  estates  in  terms  of
customary law.

In the Moseneke case the Constitutional Court said in its findings that  the
benefits of the administration of deceased estates by magistrates,  such  as
convenience and low costs, can also be achieved through a  nondiscriminatory
provision. After  thorough  consideration  of  all  the  possibilities,  the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development decided that  the  best
way to achieve the benefits of central  records  and  control,  as  well  as
accessibility by and support for people on  the  ground,  is  to  place  the
administration of all estates under  the  control  of  the  Master,  but  to
designate certain service points where  officials  of  the  department  will
exercise the necessary  functions  with  regard  to  the  administration  of
estates on behalf of, and under the control of the Master.

Clause 1 of this Bill proposes a new section 2A for Act 66 of 1965  to  make
provision for this. As an interim measure  until  the  SA  Law  Commission's
review of customary law with regard to succession has been completed, it  is
proposed that all deceased estates, which have not been  devolved  according
to customary law, must be administered under  the  control  of  the  Master.
This Bill makes it clear that  the  Master  will  have  no  jurisdiction  or
function with regard to deceased estates  devolved  according  to  customary
law.

Arrangements will be made for the repeal of  the  aforementioned  regulation
to  coincide  with  the  coming  into  operation  of  this  Bill.  Based  on
statistics and information  from  officials  who  currently  deal  with  the
function regarding the administration of estates  by  magistrate's  offices,
officials will be appointed  at  service  points  to  exercise  nonessential
powers and functions on behalf of and under the control of the Master.

These officials  will,  for  example,  be  able  to  issue  appointments  in
appropriate small estates, be able to hold meetings of beneficiaries and  be
able to render assistance with the settling of small estates. In some  cases
they will merely convey documents to the Master and be  of  assistance  with
enquiries.  This Bill implements the ruling  of  the  Constitutional  Court,
and now gets rid  of  a  section  of  the  existing  Act  which  amounts  to
discrimination on the basis of skin colour.

The committee supported the Bill unanimously, and I now ask this Council  to
do the same.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                                FINANCE BILL

     (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Finance
                                  thereon)

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, hon Minister and  members  of  the  House,  the
objective of the Finance Bill is to give effect to the  resolutions  of  the
Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,  specifically  that  unauthorised
expenditure be authorised.

Clause 1 of the Bill informs  us  that  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public
Accounts recommends authorisation by Parliament of unauthorised  expenditure
of almost R410 million.  This  is  directly  charged  against  the  National
Revenue Fund.  The  unauthorised  expenditure  is  described  fully  in  the
reports of the Auditor-General. Clause 2 of the Bill refers to  unauthorised
expenditure that is a consequence of the overspending of Votes.

These cases were considered by the Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts
and, after intense deliberation, were recommended for authorisation. If  the
proposal to authorise is passed by Parliament, the  amounts  overspent  will
form direct charges against the  National  Revenue  Fund.  The  unauthorised
expenditure amounts to little over R250 million.

Clause 3 proposes the authorisation of unauthorised  expenditure  for  which
no refunds will be made.  Clause  4,  however,  stipulates  that  action  to
recover money continue.

This section 77 Bill has financial implications for the  state.  The  amount
of R250,355 million will have to be financed from the National Revenue  Fund
as it must cover the overspending in the Votes concerned.

Finally, as this  Bill  contains  provisions  that  propose  direct  charges
against the National Revenue Fund, it is dealt with in accordance  with  the
procedures established by section 77 of the Constitution. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                 AGRICULTURAL DEBT MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL

    (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Land and
                       Environmental Affairs thereon)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson and hon members, I rise to make  a  statement  on
the Agricultural Debt Management Amendment Bill today, 5 November 2002.

The amendment brought to this committee was essentially  to  change  section
9(1) of the Agricultural Debt Management Act, Act  45  of  2001.  The  Chief
Registrar of Deeds believed that this section, in its current state, was  in
conflict with the provisions of the Deeds Registries Act of 1937.

It seems that section 9(1) of the Agricultural Debt Management Act  of  2001
only allows an official from the Deeds Registry to lodge  documentation  for
registration.  It  does  not  allow  for  the  framing  of  mortgage  bonds,
agreements, consents, authorisations and other  documentation  by  officials
of the Department of Agriculture.  This  oversight  has  severely  inhibited
officials from the Department of Agriculture. It was  therefore  seen  as  a
matter of urgency that the issue be rectified.

The new amending Bill, therefore, seeks to give the necessary  authority  to
the Department of Agriculture to exercise all the  responsibilities  related
to  mortgage  bonds,  agreements,   consents,   authorisations   and   other
documentation tendered for the purposes of the Agricultural Debt  Management
Act, Act 45 of 2001.  This  amendment,  though  small  and  technical,  will
ensure that there is no unnecessary expenditure or wastage by the state.
Our committee agrees with the amendment as proposed. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on behalf of the New NP, I wish  to  state
that we support this amending Bill. We appeal to the department to  get  the
procedures in place as soon as possible so that the money that is  recovered
is made available again  for  community  development.  This  House  and  the
communities out there must be thoroughly informed regarding  how  it  should
be done.

The New NP supports this amending Bill.]
