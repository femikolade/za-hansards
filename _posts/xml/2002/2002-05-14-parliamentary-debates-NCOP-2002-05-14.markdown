                                   MOTIONS

                               (Announcement)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! May  I  suggest
to hon members that unless their motions  are  urgent,  they  try  to  avoid
putting them forward today. I am not saying that  members  should  not  move
motions, but just that they should remember that the  hon  the  Minister  of
Sport and Recreation is offering members something this evening, so  if  our
sitting goes on into the night, we will forgo such benefits.  Does  any  hon
member therefore wish to give notice of a  motion?  [Interjections.]  I  did
not threaten you. [Laughter.]

                          DEATH OF MRS F R MATTHEWS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its deep regret and sadness at  the  death  of  Mrs  Fikile
       Regina Matthews;


  (2) conveys its sincere condolences to her daughter  Mrs  Naledi  Pandor,
       Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces,  her  husband,  the
       hon Deputy Minister Joe Matthews, and to other members of her  family
       in their sad bereavement;


  (3) affirms the great affection and esteem in which she was held  by  all
       those who knew her; and


  (4) expresses its gratitude for her life of outstanding loyalty and close
       association with the  struggle  for  freedom  and  democracy  in  our
       country.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

            ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AGAINST MR P MARAIS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Me C S BOTHA: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:
  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van -


       (a)  talle aanklagte van seksule teistering wat teen  die  Wes-Kaapse
           Premier, mnr Peter Marais, aanhangig gemaak is; en


       (b)  sy ongegronde rasionalisering  van  hierdie  universeel  erkende
           misdryf as ``die gevolg van kulturele verskille'';


  (2) hom distansieer van mnr Marais se standpunte; en


  (3) hom opnuut verbind tot onverbiddelike teenkanting teen enige skending
       van die waardigheid van vroue, hetsy deur aksie of deur insinuasie.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion without notice follows.)

[Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the numerous charges of sexual harassment  brought  against  the
           Western Cape Premier, Mr Peter Marais; and


       (b)  his unfounded rationalisation  of  this  universally  recognised
           offence as being "the result of cultural differences";


  (2) distances itself from Mr Marais' viewpoints; and


  (3) recommits itself to unyielding opposition to any violation of the  of
       women, whether by action or by insinuation.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Is  there  any
objection to the motion?  There  is  an  objection.  In  the  light  of  the
objection, the motion may not be proceeded with. It will become notice of  a
motion.
                CONGRATULATIONS ON MS E N LUBIDLA'S BIRTHDAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates Ms Evelyn Numpumelelo Lubidla on her birthday today;


  (2) notes that Ms Lubidla has been with this institution  from  its  very
       beginning and has been an integral part of  its  evolution  from  the
       Senate to the National Council of Provinces;


  (3) commends her for the excellent contribution she has made in fostering
       a close working relationship between her province  and  the  Council;
       and


  (4) wishes her well for the future.
[Applause.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

An HON MEMBER: How old is she?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Ask  her  after  the
sitting! [Laughter.]

                       RESOLUTION ADOPTED ON PALESTINE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson,  I  was  tempted  to  amend  the
previous motion to read ``on her 21st birthday'', but since that motion  has
already been adopted, I shall move on  to  the  next  one.  I  move  without
notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the resolution adopted by the Council on 9  May  2002  was
       intended as a motivation for the agreed  subject  for  discussion  on
       Palestine of that afternoon; and


  (2) therefore resolves that the adopted  resolution  be  viewed  in  that
       context.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                               POINT OF ORDER

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Just  before
coming to the Orders of the Day, I want to deal  with  a  matter  which  has
stood over from the previous sitting. As hon members will correctly  recall,
at a plenary of the NCOP on 7 May this year,  the  hon  Ms  Botha  raised  a
point of order as to whether it was parliamentary for the  hon  Mr  Tolo  to
accuse a member of this Parliament, in this case the leader of  the  DA,  of
having been guilty of murder.
At that time I indicated from the Chair to the hon Mr Tolo that  if  he  had
said that the leader of the DA had killed people, he would have to  withdraw
those remarks. The hon Mr Tolo replied that he had said that the  leader  of
the DA had served in an army that killed and maimed our people. Since  there
was a dispute I indicated that I would ascertain  from  the  Hansard  record
what the exact wording was and deliver a ruling, which I am now doing.

I have had the opportunity to look at  the  Hansard  and  according  to  the
record, the words of the hon Mr Tolo were as follows:


  We will remember that their leader today, Mr Tony Leon, was  among  those
  people who maimed our people in this country; killed them.

Although the hon Mr Tolo did not expressly say that Mr Leon  was  guilty  of
murder, the reference that Mr Leon was among those  who  maimed  and  killed
people clearly implies that Mr Leon killed and maimed  people.  I  therefore
rule that the remarks of the hon Mr Tolo are unparliamentary and  should  be
withdrawn.

Whereupon the member withdrew the remark.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 19 - Sport and Recreation South Africa:

The MINISTER OF SPORT  AND  RECREATION:  Chairperson,  I  stood  before  hon
members of this House this time last year and  started  my  address  with  a
tribute to the MEC for sport and recreation of the Northern Cape,  Mr  Brian
Hermanus, who had died tragically and in an untimely fashion in a motor  car
accident while on official duty.

I stand before hon members today again to pay tribute to a dear  friend  and
brother,  my  predecessor,  Comrade  Stephen  Vukile  Tshwete,  who,   while
enjoying unprecedented success in his portfolio of safety and security,  was
taken away from us quite suddenly.

I know that many tributes have been paid to Bhut Steve  over  the  past  two
weeks, but I feel, given his pioneering work within the field of  sport  and
recreation, that it is only fitting that we recognise  his  contribution  to
this institution in our society in this House again today.

Comrade Steve made my task as his successor so much easier by having laid  a
solid foundation upon which I could build. His legacy will  remain  with  us
forever, and there can be no better way to honour him, I  believe,  than  to
continue what he started, and to actualise  what  he  set  out  to  achieve,
namely: to make sport and recreation accessible to all  South  Africans;  to
ensure that all our sports  teams,  including  the  national  representative
teams, reflect the demography of our  country;  to  ensure  that  we  are  a
successful nation in our international endeavours; and to ensure that  sport
and recreation makes a positive  contribution  to  the  achievement  of  the
ideal society that we know is possible at the southern tip  of  the  African
continent.

Of course, Comrade  Steve  was  also  committed  to  making  an  appropriate
contribution to the development of the African continent in  line  with  the
African Renaissance. In memory of his life, I would like to commit the  rest
of my career in sport and recreation towards achieving the  ideals  that  he
had for this institution. I will miss  him  as  my  mentor.  He  was  always
willing to give advice whenever I approached him.

Hardly had we come to grips with the blow that  we  were  dealt  by  Steve's
passing, when we were again struck by the news of  the  tragic  death  of  a
colleague and personal friend, the Minister  of  Sport  of  Nigeria,  Ishaya
Mark Aku. What made the tragedy  of  his  death  in  an  aircraft  crash  in
Nigeria last Saturday even worse for me was the fact that  I  had  just  met
with him a week earlier at an intergovernmental antidoping meeting in  Kuala
Lumpur in Malaysia, where this vibrant young man in the prime  of  his  life
gave  me  valuable  support  in  our  efforts  to  ensure  that  Africa  was
adequately and appropriately represented in the World Antidoping Agency  and
that, as a continent, we played our rightful role in this structure.

I have passed on our condolences to the sports movement of  Nigeria  and  to
his family. It is going to be hard to find a replacement  for  this  dynamic
young man, particularly  at  this  critical  time  for  Nigeria,  as  it  is
preparing to host the eighth All Africa Games  in  2003  -  a  project  that
Ishaya Mark Aku was heading.

We have lost two great leaders who have had a significant  impact  on  sport
and recreation on the African continent. While it is going  to  be  hard  to
find replacements for  them,  we  have  to  continue  with  our  efforts  to
actualise the objectives that they cherished for the institution.

I am honoured to be able to address this  august  House  in  this  my  third
budget speech as Minister of Sport and Recreation. I believe  that  my  task
in making a case for sport and recreation this year  is  relatively  easier,
as I have a sense that the importance of the institution, for which  I  have
been given responsibility in our country, is slowly being recognised.

In the latter regard, allow me to quote from two  recent  speeches  made  by
significant role-players in our country. Firstly:


  The  Presidential  Sports  Awards  should   not   be   seen   simply   as
  acknowledgements of past greatness, the performances of  yesteryear,  but
  also, and more fundamentally, as an investment in our people for years to
  come and for the sustained development of  sport  and  society  in  South
  Africa.


  These awards must be seen as part of  that  fundamental  national  effort
  that we have undertaken as South Africans, and that is to push  back  the
  frontiers of poverty and to lend a hand to building a better life for our
  children, our youth, indeed, for all the people of our  land,  especially
  those who still reside in areas of underdevelopment and are  deprived  of
  benefits owing to all South Africans.


  It is with this in mind that we must measure our  success,  even  on  the
  playing fields. We must see the transformation of  sport  and  recreation
  not simply as  finding  the  ways  and  means  to  improve  the  physical
  performance of  all  our  athletes,  but  rather  as  enthusing  all  our
  sportspeople to lend a hand to build a better life.

I continue with the quote:


  The Australians are very proud of sport and their sports achievements and
  you can see very clearly as you talk  to  them,  the  great  impact  that
  sports has on the cohesion of Australian society.  But  you  also  get  a
  sense of the great investment that the country and society  make  in  the
  development of sports because they understand what sports mean.


  I would like to offer our Minister of Sport  and  Recreation  that  I  am
  quite ready to join a  delegation  that  he  will  lead  to  our  Finance
  Minister to say we need to put more resources into sport. I think we want
  to see amongst our winners the people of South Africa and not some of the
  people of South Africa - the people of South Africa.

These were the words of President Thabo Mbeki  at  the  Presidential  Sports
Awards in Cape Town on 8 March 2002.

Allow me to read you a second quotation:


  We could invest more in sports, particularly  for  the  youth  as  sports
  bridge cultural boundaries and have the potential to  promote  tolerance,
  trust, respect and social cohesion.


  More importantly, sport is fertile ground for much-needed  positive  role
  models to our youth.


  We should emerge with a programme  that  gives  South  Africans  hope,  a
  programme that says,  in  working  toward  moral  regeneration:  We  will
  mobilise for care and support.

Chairperson - I keep on thinking that you  are  Madam  Chairperson  -  these
were the words of Deputy President Jacob  Zuma  at  the  Moral  Regeneration
Summit in Pretoria on 18 April 2002.

I would  like  to  put  to  this  House  that  this  is  the  most  emphatic
recognition given by our leaders, the President and  the  Deputy  President,
of the potential role of sport and recreation in our society.  Indeed,  they
have placed sport firmly in the mainstream of  the  national  agenda  and  I
thank them for that. I commit myself to the  challenge  of  actualising  the
confidence that they have expressed in sport and recreation contributing  to
the betterment of our society.

I have always held the view that as Sport and Recreation we can play a  much
bigger role than that which we have always been afforded, and I  am  pleased
that my appeals for more resources to enable us to exploit the potential  of
the institution for the common good of the country are  being  acknowledged.
Sportspeople are waiting anxiously to make that contribution and I am  quite
excited about that.

I always appreciate addressing this House because of its  proximity  to  the
sites where the delivery of sport and recreation take place in our  country,
namely the provinces, the cities and the towns - and rural  areas  as  well.
We can put in lots of villages,  because  I  am  a  village  ``plaasjapie.''
[Fellow hailing from the countryside]. I would like  to  make  use  of  this
opportunity to recommit myself to fostering co-operative  governance  within
sport and recreation, even though this constitutes an  exclusive  provincial
competency.

Indeed, I have made a concerted effort to draw the local  government  sector
into  the  fold  by  encouraging  them  to  participate  in  the   Technical
Intergovernmental   Committee   with   their   national    and    provincial
counterparts, but, unfortunately, with limited success to date. I know  that
the local government sector has just emerged  from  a  difficult  period  of
restructuring, and I shall continue with my efforts to involve them  with  a
view to  fulfilling  Government's  commitment  to  integrated  planning  and
service delivery. Moreover, we have to give form to  Government's  expressed
intention to give greater responsibility for delivery  to  local  government
structures.

I am introducing a budget of R160 million  today,  a  55%  increase  on  the
budget of last year. This increase is largely as a result of  the  increased
funding that we are getting from the Poverty Relief Fund, for upgrading  and
building  sports  and  recreational  facilities  in  conjunction  with   the
provinces and  local  authorities  in  disadvantaged  areas  throughout  the
country. Our baseline budget has, however, not increased substantially,  and
this continues to constrain  us  from  achieving  the  outcomes  of  greater
access and representativity, amongst others.

I am happy to declare that less than 17,6% of the budget  is  allocated  for
administrative and personnel costs and that a mere 7% constitutes  personnel
costs. Of course, funding for  sport  and  recreation  in  South  Africa  is
still, despite the improvements that we have seen recently, a far  cry  from
what it is in other countries with whom we are competing. This puts us at  a
distinct disadvantage. I am happy to report also that of  the  R103  million
that we had available last year, we were able to spend R101 million, or  98%
of  our  allocation.  The  only  savings  that  were  realised  related   to
administration costs that could not be shifted to  other  areas  where  they
could have been spent.

One of the most significant areas in which the  three  tiers  of  government
have reaped the benefits of co-operation  and  where  local  government  has
been drawn in to a considerable  extent,  has  been  within  the  sphere  of
upgrading existing, and the  provision  of  new,  basic  sports  facilities.
Through this project  we  are  making  a  sustainable  contribution  to  the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development project and to  the  Urban  Renewal
Project.

Over the past financial year we have successfully  delivered  55  facilities
in disadvantaged, mainly rural, communities.  Of  these,  30%  were  located
within the  identified  rural  and  urban  development  nodes.  Despite  the
various teething problems that were experienced  in  the  process,  we  were
able to spend all of the resources put at our disposal through  the  poverty
alleviation, infrastructure creation and Jobs  Summit  funds  in  the  first
year of our involvement in the project. We are  proud  of  our  achievements
and wish to thank the provincial and local governments  involved  for  their
superb co-operation in the project, often under very  trying  and  difficult
circumstances.

We were able to make a difference to the lives of  2  126  people  who  were
employed in the construction phase of the facility by  providing  them  with
an income and empowering them with skills that they will now be able to  use
to  sell  themselves  more  effectively  in  the  labour  market.  Of  these
employees 47% were women, 39% were young people  and  70  were  people  with
disabilities. In total R8,75 million found its way  to  the  people  in  the
form of wages.

Of course, we have  also  been  able  to  create  permanent  employment  for
individuals who will be managing and maintaining facilities.  I  would  like
to appeal to the provinces to encourage an  entrepreneurial  spirit  at  the
facilities that have been  built  by  creating  opportunities  for  informal
trading at these venues when activities take place there. I  am  happy  that
we have been able to contribute to poverty alleviation  in  the  communities
that have benefited from our projects and especially for the  role  that  we
have played  in  promoting  black  economic  empowerment  by  ensuring  that
disadvantaged contractors were engaged to do much of the work  that  we  put
out to tender.

For the current financial year we will almost  be  doubling  our  output  in
that we are going to be building at  85  sites  throughout  the  country.  A
total of 66%  of  these  sites  are  located  within  the  rural  and  urban
development nodes. This time round we hope to impact on the lives of some  6
500 people who will be employed and thereby improve the quality of  life  of
many more who are the dependants of these employees.
In July we will also  start  with  the  planning  process  for  the  2003-04
financial year,  during  which  time  we  intend  launching  a  further  105
projects. The support of the  NCOP  will  be  appreciated  in  ensuring  the
success of these endeavours, thereby contributing to growth  in  areas  that
are still extremely underdeveloped.

I had the privilege earlier this year to hand over the first  facility  that
was completed to the Kutlwanong community in the Sol  Plaatje  Metropole  in
the Northern Cape, and was touched by the appreciation and  sense  of  pride
that it instilled in  that  community.  It  was  abundantly  clear  that  it
contributed to rekindling the dignity of the people of  the  town.  I  trust
that the impact will be similar in all the communities that we are and  will
be involving, and that this will contribute  to  protecting  the  facilities
against vandalism and neglect. I believe that this House has  a  vital  role
to play in this regard.

Of course, our purpose  in  providing  communities  with  facilities  is  to
ensure,  amongst  other  things,  that  our  youth  have  opportunities   to
participate in wholesome and constructive activities  that  will  contribute
to the moral regeneration initiative  that  Government  has  embarked  upon.
Government has  acknowledged  the  role  that  sport  can  play  and,  as  I
indicated earlier,  we  are  prepared  to  take  up  that  challenge.  I  am
convinced that  the  problems  that  we  are  currently  facing  in  certain
communities  are  related  to  the  lack  of  facilities   and   appropriate
activities for our youth in these areas.

We have already embarked upon a project  aimed  at  establishing  sport  and
recreation clubs in identified high-crime  areas  in  conjunction  with  the
SAPS. We are also targeting the areas where we have built facilities and  we
will be working in close co-operation with  the  community  sports  councils
that we have established at these sites, to further this cause.

In this regard I would like to confirm that the  programme  ``The  youth  is
our future'' is still on track  and  I  have  been  actively  involved  with
Admiral Clothing in distributing sports kit  and  equipment  to  schools  in
disadvantaged areas to enable children in these schools  to  participate  in
sport on a more level playing  field,  while  still  acknowledging  that  we
still have a long way to go to achieve this ideal. I would once  again  like
to laud the contribution of Admiral  Clothing  and  express  the  wish  that
other sports providers in this domain would emulate them. To  date  we  have
covered 350 of the 1 000 schools that we eventually hope to reach.  I  would
implore hon members  to  liaise  with  their  respective  provinces  in  the
identification of schools that need this type of support.

Our efforts to exploit the potential of  sport  and  recreation  to  achieve
positive outcomes will not, however, succeed without the active  involvement
of volunteers. Sport in general is largely dependent  on  volunteers  and  a
powerful spirit of Vukuzenzele. Again, I appeal to  hon  members  for  their
support in encouraging such a disposition in their constituencies.  We  must
commit ourselves selflessly in service of the common good, and every one  of
us should lend  a  hand  in  doing  the  simple  things  that  will  make  a
difference to the lives of especially the poor.

Government has declared 2002  the  Year  of  the  Volunteer,  and  we  shall
redouble our efforts to ensure that these people who  give  of  their  time,
effort and very often their own resources in the  interests  of  others  are
given the appropriate recognition.

Allow me, therefore, very briefly  to  concentrate  on  the  more  pertinent
issues that I think have a direct relevance to this House.

Members are well aware that I have three structures that report directly  to
me: Sport and Recreation South Africa, the SA Sports Commission and  the  SA
Institute for Drug-Free Sport. I would like to focus on the  programmes  and
projects that have a direct bearing on provincial and local  authorities  at
this stage.

I have  been  involved  in  the  Government  initiative  of  provincial  and
national imbizos [meetings] for the  past  two  quarters  through  which,  I
believe, we have achieved remarkable successes  in  engaging  directly  with
people on the ground in cities and towns around  the  country.  I  have  had
very interesting encounters with citizens at the  grass-roots  level,  whose
inputs are often extremely  insightful  and  would  certainly  influence  my
thinking in future. I believe this is an excellent initiative that  deserves
greater involvement and interest from the members of this House.

I would like to reflect very briefly  on  some  of  the  initiatives  within
Sport and Recreation South Africa to which I believe this House  could  make
a substantial contribution.

We hosted a very successful Presidential Sports Awards  Ceremony  this  year
in Tuynhuys. We are increasingly realising our  dream  of  ensuring  greater
representativity among the award winners at the ceremony. I believe that  we
should involve  the  provinces  to  a  greater  extent  in  integrating  the
provincial  and  national  ceremonies,  in  the   spirit   of   co-operative
governance and inclusivity. Once again, I have instructed my  department  to
ensure that this happens in future.

We  have  had  a  very  successful  season  with  the  Siyadlala  television
programme. I am sure many members have  seen  that  programme  every  Monday
afternoon at 17:00 and repeats on Fridays. It  has  moved  now  to  Saturday
mornings. The series will be extended  and  we  have  offered  provinces  an
opportunity to showcase their initiatives in sport  and  recreation  on  it.
Once again, I would like to urge members of the House  to  get  involved  in
this effort to ensure maximum  exposure  for  the  work  of  our  provincial
departments responsible for sport and recreation in getting  the  nation  to
play.

We are in the process of publishing a  revised  White  Paper  on  Sport  and
Recreation that takes cognisance of the altered governance landscape in  the
institution. At the same time we have embarked upon the process  of  writing
a new White Paper for sport  and  recreation  that  will  chart  the  course
forward for our activities in the next five  years.  This  initiative  might
correspond very closely with my intention to appoint a task team to  oversee
the drafting of a national plan for sport and recreation, a  sequel  to  the
Ministerial Task Team on High-Performance Sport, whose  report  we  are  now
busy interrogating with a view to implementing some of the  recommendations.
These  recommendations  could  have  far-reaching  consequences  for   high-
performance sport in our country, but I shall refrain  from  elaborating  on
it at this juncture. People can, however, expect an announcement from me  in
this regard soon.

I am also happy to report that we are moving closer to  the  public  process
with regard to the broadcasting  of  sports  events  of  national  interest.
Icasa has appointed consultants to investigate the issue and they  shall  be
engaging the public on this shortly.

I shall continue with  my  drive  to  ensure  that  sport  in  South  Africa
continues on the path  of  transformation,  so  that  every  person  in  our
country has an equal chance to access  the  institution  and  to  reach  the
highest level that his or her potential allows for.

I have already had meetings  involving  24  federations,  which  all  signed
performance agreements with me, articulating their  plans  and  targets  for
ensuring greater representativity at all levels within their sport from  the
playing, officiating, administration, coaching and management  perspectives.
I shall call them to account within one year to determine whether they  have
accomplished what they have set out to achieve and establish ways and  means
to assist them if they fail. We shall proceed in this manner with  more  and
more federations on an annual basis  until  I  am  satisfied  that  we  have
achieved our goals.

Within the same context, I  have  requested  my  officials  to  revisit  the
resolutions that were made at the Colloquium Against Racism in Sport  during
the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination,  Xenophobia  and
Related Intolerance in Durban last year with a view to determining how  this
declaration can be implemented.
I wish to bring to the attention of this House that during my  deliberations
with national federations, I  am  often  confronted  with  claims  that  the
problems surrounding transformation and  racism  are  not  so  much  at  the
national level, but rather that provincial and local sports  structures  are
the stumbling blocks and the culprits. In this regard,  therefore,  I  would
like to appeal to hon members to strengthen my  hand  by  urging  provincial
and local authorities  to  tackle  the  problem  head-on.  Only  by  working
together in this manner will we be able to achieve the desired results.

A solution to the question of school sport continues to elude  us.  We  have
received  a  very  clear  indication  from  the  Mincombud,  the  Minister's
Committee on the Budget, that school sport is  a  competency  of  provincial
departments of education.

I am still of the opinion,  however,  and  I  have  been  supported  by  the
Technical  Intergovernmental  Committee  in  this  regard,  that   Education
departments should take responsibility for the curricular aspects of  school
sport, while  Sport  and  Recreation  should  take  responsibility  for  the
competitive and representative aspects thereof. I shall continue  to  pursue
this argument,  and  I  appeal  to  this  House,  the  Select  Committee  on
Education and Recreation and Ntate Kgware to support me in this  regard,  in
order to secure a speedy solution to the matter. I am  convinced  that  part
of the problem that we are experiencing  with  our  national  representative
teams, in terms of their current international success rate,  is  linked  to
the absence of the  solid foundation that school sport can provide.

I am looking forward to the inaugural South African  Games  that  will  take
place in Pretoria from 25 to 30 September this year. These games will  serve
as a nursery for our elite performers, by giving those  individuals  in  the
under-23 age group, and who are on the verge of breaking into  the  national
team, opportunities to display their skills  and  talents,  and  to  provide
them with a chance to compete against the best from around the country.

All nine provinces will take part in  this  festival  of  sports  comprising
nine codes, including soccer, netball, athletics,  swimming,  sevens  rugby,
cricket, table tennis, field hockey and  goalball,  in  which  opportunities
for participation by  women  and  people  with  disabilities  will  also  be
maximised.  Hon  members'  support  for  the  event  and,  indeed,  for  the
participation of their constituencies and provinces,  will  be  appreciated.
The event will take place biannually  on  a  rotational  basis  amongst  the
provinces, and is intended  also  to  provide  economic  spin-offs  for  the
centres in which it will take place.

Very  quickly,  we  are  in  discussions  with  the  Sports  Commission   on
provincial sports academies which should be playing  a  vital  role  in  the
nurturing of our up-and-coming elite performers. Some provinces  have  these
academies and others do not. We are trying to assist those that  have  them,
and we are trying to make sure that we create them in those  provinces  that
do not have them.

We are also looking forward to the  possible  establishment  of  a  national
sports academy that, I believe, can play a  vital  role  in  addressing  the
problems that we are experiencing, also with the performances of our  teams.
I am currently considering various options in this regard  and  we  will  be
consulting with the Minister of Finance about resourcing such a project.

I am aware that there is a great deal of concern about the  apparently  slow
progress in areas such as recreation, indigenous games and women  in  sport.
I am quite happy to report that the Sports Commission has made  considerable
progress in these domains and will unveil their  plans  for  these  projects
shortly. We have held recreation workshops in all the provinces,  recreation
structures are being formalised and  mass  participation  events  are  being
planned.

With regard to the indigenous games project, a research report is  currently
being finalised and a national  festival  of  indigenous  games  is  on  the
cards. So, Kgosi Mokoena should get ready with his stick fighting!  We  will
have the indigenous games nationally. Other members can get ready with  rope
jumping,  Ugqaphu,  and  I  want  to  challenge  some  of  them   to   that.
[Interjections.] No, golf is not indigenous! Efforts are also being made  to
network with countries in the SADC region in respect  of  indigenous  games,
while locally we are investigating  the  standardisation  of  equipment  for
these games.

A policy document on women in sport has been drafted. I  am  satisfied  with
what I have seen and I have requested that it should be distributed  to  the
provinces for comments via the  Technical  Intergovernmental  Committee  and
Minmec.

Lastly, I would like to report that I have received Judge  Ngoepe's  interim
report on the Ellis Park soccer disaster. I am eagerly  awaiting  his  final
report so that we can lay this tragic incident  in  our  country's  sporting
history to rest in the knowledge and  comfort  that  those  who  lost  their
lives in the disaster would have  secured,  for  generations  to  come,  the
assurance that something of this nature will never happen again. The  report
has been made public. The President has allowed it to be  made  public.  The
Select Committee on Education and Recreation will get a copy of that report

Of course, Bafana Bafana will be departing for the 2002 FIFA  World  Cup  in
Korea/Japan on Friday. We wish our team well and  give  them  the  assurance
that they have the support of every South African. We are proud of the  fact
that they have qualified for this prestigious  event,  an  achievement  that
must certainly be the dream of every footballing  nation.  Of  course,  they
played well in KwaZulu-Natal, in Durban, and  they  are  leaving  with  that
victory under their belt. The announcement of the final  squad  will  be  on
Thursday, and, of course, many  members  here  who  love  football  will  be
sitting in front of their televisions to watch if some of their  stars  will
be among the 23 that will be going to Korea and Japan. As I  stand  here,  I
do not even know who  is  going  and  who  is  not  going.  [Interjections.]
[Laughter.] And Cyril Nzama!

Our Commonwealth Games team will be participating in  the  Manchester  Games
later this year, and we trust that they will be able  to  improve  on  their
performances at the 1998 games in Kuala Lumpur. By  the  time  I  come  back
here next year, we would also have witnessed the Cricket World  Cup  in  our
country in 2003, and I would like to urge provinces to ensure that each  and
every South African is afforded an opportunity  to  derive  maximal  benefit
from this event, and that we use it to present a  favourable  image  of  our
country and society internationally to secure similar events in future.

In concluding,  I  want  to  express  my  sincere  thanks  to  everyone  who
contributed towards making this task less onerous than it could  have  been.
In particular, I would like to thank the Select Committee on  Education  and
Recreation in the NCOP for the support that it has given me. The  same  goes
for the MECs, who, without fail, attend Minmec. I thank Minmec  itself,  the
Technical Intergovernmental  Committee,  the  staff  in  the  Ministry,  and
especially the parliamentary  officer  Rodney  Swiegelaar,  who  deals  with
issues  on  Parliament,  Sports  and  Recreation  South  Africa,  its  head,
Professor Denver Hendricks - they are all sitting  here  on  our  left-hand-
side - Solomon Phango, who deals with all  the  areas  around  for  poverty-
relief buildings for sports, as well as our CEO of the Sports  Commission  -
I did not see him coming in - former MEC from Limpopo, Dr Joe  Phaahla,  who
is sitting there, as well as everybody who is  there,  including  our  Chief
Director, Greg Fredericks, who deals with the federations, which is  not  an
easy job at all.

As always, my thanks also go to the macrobodies,  the  national  federations
and their  various  affiliates,  as  well  as  each  and  every  individual,
particularly the volunteers who so selflessly contribute  to  ensuring  that
sport and recreation continue to take place in South  Africa.  I  laud  them
for their example within the context of Vukuzenzele. I am  sure  that  sport
and recreation can set a fine example in this regard for other  institutions
to follow. I thank hon members. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I so wish I  could  see  the  hon  the
Minister playing Ugqaphu. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister of Sport and Recreation,  hon  MECs
for  Sport  and  Recreation,  hon  special  delegates,   hon   members   and
distinguished guests, 10 years after the  death  of  apartheid  sports,  the
deceased is still breathing. This  is,  however,  not  entirely  surprising,
given the amount of negative coverage of and responses to  our  well-meaning
efforts to transform our teams in order to  ensure  that  they  reflect  the
demographics of this country at all sporting levels.

The same goes for the  issue  of  transforming  the  administration  of  our
federations. At this juncture in  the  history  of  our  country,  we  still
maintain that these  issues  are  non-negotiable.  We  are  quite  aware  of
malicious attempts by some, especially in media circles, to create  a  sense
of division amongst our compatriots as to what is  meant  by  transformation
of our sport, and this does not contribute to making us a winning nation.
Redressing the past distortions is the mandate we  have  received  from  the
overwhelming majority of the electorate  and  we  will  steadfastly  execute
this mandate. This is, unfortunately, the reality. Black  sportspersons  are
extremely frustrated because of the refusal of coaches to  give  recognition
to their talents and the generally slow pace  of  transformation.  All  they
are asking for is the creation of an environment in which they can  showcase
their talents.

We are not asking for any favours  or  preferential  treatment.  As  elected
public representatives of this institution we have  a  moral  obligation  to
create the environment in which equity and access,  accountability,  redress
and representativity are the key elements.

As he has already mentioned, the hon Minister recently signed a  performance
agreement with a number of federations to  fast-track  and  assist  them  in
their quest for transformation. This gesture will ensure that  they  are  in
line with Government policy  on  transformation  in  order  to  improve  the
quality of life of all South Africans.

Budget Vote 19  before  this  august  House  today  also  places  sport  and
recreation at the  forefront  of  efforts  to  address  issues  of  national
importance, such as unemployment, economic development, poverty and  health.
It is for these reasons that we would like to commend Sport  and  Recreation
South Africa for linking its objectives with the priorities  of  Government,
and in this respect, we commend Sport and Recreation South Africa once  more
for its Building for Sport and Recreation programme. Its main thrust is  the
funding of new sport and recreation facilities; the  upgrading  of  existing
facilities, thereby creating employment  opportunities;  income  generation,
and poverty relief.

Through these programmes, sport is utilised as  a  vehicle  to  support  the
objectives  of  other  Government  programmes,  such   as   human   resource
development, rural development and urban  renewal,  prioritising  the  poor,
and speeding up  delivery  of  basic  services.  The  Minister  has  already
mentioned those. Also flowing out of the Building for Sport  and  Recreation
programme is Sport and Recreation South  Africa's  objective  of  increasing
the levels of participation  of  South  Africans  in  sport  and  recreation
activities.

The projected outcome is an increase in  participation  in  organised  Sport
and Recreation from its present 7% to 20%, with an  emphasis  on  increasing
the levels  of  participation  of  disadvantaged  and  marginalised  groups,
including black South Africans,  women  and  persons  with  disability.  Key
elements of this programme include the provision  of  training  in  facility
management and the implementation of a sustainable maintenance project.

Another encouraging objective is the development of ``the case  for  sport''
document, which will  raise  the  profile  of  sport.  This  is  being  done
primarily to raise the profile of sport among decision-makers  in  order  to
secure more resources for sports and recreation.
In  terms  of  policy   development,   Government   has   largely   retained
responsibility for national policy on sport and recreation, resulting  in  a
more streamlined Ministry and necessitating a number of  amendments  to  the
Sports Commission  Act.  The  SA  Sports  Commission  Third  Amendment  Bill
augments the Minister's role in the commission, and we support this. We  are
also anticipating the fourth amending Bill that will  align  the  SA  Sports
Commission with the Public Finance Management Act, Act No  1  of  1999,  and
will provide a clear distinction between the roles  of  the  commission  and
Sport and Recreation South Africa.

Moreover, new legislation governing boxing was  enacted  in  2001  and  this
House looks forward to the new Bill  that  will  govern  provincial  boxing,
which will be tabled later this year.

We are also proud of Sport and Recreation South  Africa.  Hon  members  will
realise that I keep saying ``Sport and Recreation South  Africa''.  I  think
that is the new name we are using now.

Regarding assistance rendered to Mali before and during the  recent  African
Cup of Nations football  tournament  held  in  that  country,  South  Africa
assisted  in  the  following  areas:  telecommunications,  ground  and   air
transport and aviation and ground control  training  equipment.  As  we  all
know, the tournament was a major success and the dividends of this  kind  of
co-operation  will  certainly  give  impetus  to  the  New  Partnership  for
Africa's Development.

The Government has demonstrated that  we  remain  uncompromising  in  giving
effect to the objectives and priorities that we have set  for  this  country
and  for  ourselves.  This  includes  a  united,  democratic  and  nonsexist
society. We will continue to prioritise equity and access. This can only  be
realised  through  a  concerted   effort   to   develop   the   historically
disadvantaged and the underprivileged.

South African sport will not be able to realise its  true  potential  unless
it reaches all its people. We are ready to play ball. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Minister Balfour, hon  special  delegates  and
hon colleagues, the stated aim of Sport and Recreation South  Africa,  which
is to improve the quality  of  life  of  all  South  Africans  by  promoting
participation in sport and recreation in the country, cannot be faulted.

The hon the Minister has just presented an exhaustive and  excellent  report
on the subject of Sport and Recreation South Africa, what it has done,  what
it intends to do, what inspires the Minister and the Ministry,  and  so  on.
But the hon Minister's usually  trenchant  remarks  on  the  big  issues  of
national  sport  teams,  their  lacklustre  performances  and  controversies
around team selection and transformation are conspicuously  absent.  He  has
alluded to these in an oblique way, but not  in  a  direct  manner,  to  the
parlous situation in which the major codes  of  cricket,  soccer  and  rugby
find themselves at present.

One of the key objectives identified by the  Ministry  is  to  increase  the
probability of success of South Africa's sportspersons and  teams  in  major
international competitions. Let us for one  moment  join  Mark  Shuttleworth
flitting across the sky and survey the  sporting  landscape.  What  a  sorry
mess. The  three  major  codes,  cricket,  rugby  and  soccer,  are  in  the
doldrums. South Africans from every walk of  life  are  wallowing  in  utter
despair and despondency as a result of poor  performances  in  international
arenas by our national sides.

Let me hasten to assure  the  House  that  I  am  not  suggesting  that  the
Minister of Sport and Recreation South  Africa  should  take  responsibility
for the diabolical failures of  our  teams  in  national  competitions.  But
allow me to dwell a little on the subject of transformation  in  sport.  The
DA is not against transformation in sport, but when the hon  Minister  wades
into national selection boards demanding racial quotas  like  a  bull  in  a
China  shop,  the  ripple  effects  affect  the  morale  of  all  concerned:
administrators, selectors, players and,  most  importantly,  spectators  and
the broad sports-loving South African public.

My  party  cannot  but  distance  itself  from  such  bumbling  efforts   at
transformation or forced integration. Let  us  instead  listen  to  what  Mr
Banele Sindani, CEO of Athletics South Africa, had to say recently:


  I looked at myself in the mirror and asked: Are we going to fight forever
  in this country? I told myself, admit that ... ASA have made  many,  very
  many, mistakes in the past. It is time to learn from those mistakes.

He went on to say:


  Race was always the most important thing, although we never admitted  it.
  We were not busy developing the sport, we  were  busy  fighting  personal
  fights.


  Leonard Chuene ...

That is the president of ASA -


  ... and I spoke about this at length and decided: it is time to build.

One of the changes made in athletics was the establishment of an elite ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Sorry, Mr Raju, would you please  take
your seat? Yes, hon member, what point are you rising on?

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Chairperson, would the member take a question, if  he  is
confident about what he is saying?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Raju, can you take a question?

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, certainly not at this stage. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Please continue, Mr Raju.

Mr N M RAJU: One of the changes made in athletics was the  establishment  of
an elite coaches co-ordinating committee. An  interesting  feature  of  this
committee, which is responsible for training  and  selection,  is  that  all
four of the people on it happened to be of one colour, that  is  white.  Let
us hear Sindani again, and I quote:


  Before it would have been peculiar  that  all  four  are  co-incidentally
  white. Now we accept them as experts in their fields. The  ASA  executive
  unanimously endorsed their appointment  without  asking  questions  about
  their race.

What is positive about this development is not that four white  people  were
chosen to do the job, it is the fact that the four best people were  chosen.
They might have been black, and that would have been just as  good  if  they
were the four best people available.

My party wishes to make it categorically clear that our national teams  must
be made up of the best players in  the  respective  codes,  irrespective  of
their skin pigment. The whole  nation  would  then  be  solidly  behind  our
Proteas, Springboks and Bafana Bafana.

Patriotism cannot be manufactured or engineered. It must  be  a  spontaneous
outpouring of national pride. We certainly do not want mediocrity to be  the
hallmark of excellence. If, as the chairperson of the select  committee  has
pointed out, the teams must reflect  the  natural  demographics,  it  surely
does apply to national  teams  at  this  moment  of  transformation  in  our
country. We must get the best.

I wish to applaud the affable Minister for his  attempts  to  reign  in  the
Premier Soccer League, which like a wild horse refuses to be  brought  under
control, when he meets the board of governors soon.

Hon  Minister  Balfour  has  expressed  his  concerns  about  the   negative
publicity the Premier Soccer  League  has  attracted  in  recent  weeks  and
insists that the PSL and Safa take steps to restore faith in the game.
In a weekend newspaper The Sunday Independent the hon Minister  is  reported
to have said: ``I am unhappy that professional football should  be  in  such
an untenable situation with regard to its finances.''  in  alluding  to  the
delay in payments of PSL clubs. [Laughter.] The hon Minister went on to  say
... [Time expired.]

Ms H H MALGAS (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, hon members,  hon  Minister,  hon
MECs and members of this House, it gives me great pleasure to speak  on  the
budget speech of the Minister, and I applaud him for the excellent  work  he
is doing in sport.

In its analysis and approach to the country's problems, the ANC  has  always
sought the most sustainable  solutions.  It  has  stayed  steadfast  to  the
principles of nonracialism and nonsexism up until today, at a time  when  it
is severely tempted not to do so. The ANC has  resisted  the  temptation  to
exchange one form of racial domination, as a solution, for another  form  of
domination.

This brings us to the ideological, contested  terrain  of  sport.  Sport  is
contested terrain in this country, because of the legacy of a  system  whose
flames have not totally been extinguished. Be that as it may, the  following
milestones have been achieved in the Eastern Cape.

Boxing has entrenched itself as the leading code in our province  at  local,
national and international levels. The same applies to black  rugby  players
who are playing  rugby  in  other  provinces  who  in  fact  come  from  our
province. Cricket has its roots in this province. We do have  our  stars  in
the national and international teams,  and  we  commit  ourselves  to  there
being more up-and-coming stars.

The  quality  of  sport  administrators  that  come  from  our   shores   is
highlighted by the huge  number  that  is  anchoring  many  federations  and
organisations at  the  national  level.  Our  drummies  are  dominating  the
national scene.  Our  physically  challenged  sportspersons  are  dominating
nationally and internationally.

The deracialisation of sport is high on the ANC agenda at this phase of  our
struggle, the struggle of its constituencies, those who cast their vote  for
transformation in all spheres of society, including sport.

The ANC, being a proactive movement, started transforming sport in  the  the
early nineties while looking forward to a  democratic  order.  At  the  same
time sports federations were looking  to  international  participation,  and
the international community was expecting  South  Africa's  compliance  with
the requirements for admission into the world of international sport.

On the  ANC's  agenda  within  the  unification  process,  three  key  areas
pertaining  to  transformation  in  sport  were  identified:   mass   based,
developmental and integrated, which is an ongoing process.

Those against transformation in sport tend to forget that we  have  a  fully
integrated National Defence  Force  according  to  our  national  population
demographics,  with  black  people,  and  Africans  in  particular,  in  the
majority. Are we saying black people are good enough to die for the  country
while the ex-minority enjoy preferential treatment when  it  comes  to  team
selection in sport?

Because  of  those  new  liberal  tendencies  against  transformation,   the
provincial  department  is  introducing  a  provincial  Bill  on  sport  and
recreation so as to ensure that the hon MEC is able to intervene  decisively
in all these matters and to carry out the  ANC-led  Government's  agenda  on
the deracialisation and integration of sport, that is, transformation,  even
if it means enforcing the quota system in its extremes.

The following measures  have  been  put  into  place.  An  indigenous  games
project  was  launched  and  is  ongoing.  The  department  has  trained  20
instructors through the Exercise  Teachers'  Academy  that  will  drive  the
programme that seeks to inculcate the culture of fitness and health  in  the
corporate, public and community sectors, which  can  lead  to  job  creation
opportunities and entrepreneurship.

We  have  excellent  relationships  with  the  New  Zealand  Hillary  Sports
Commission and the  Australian  sport  and  recreation  department.  We  are
benefiting from these partnerships in terms of  the  introduction  of  young
kids to  sports  and  recreation,  administration  and  the  development  of
infrastructure.

We have programmes facilitated by our veterans to instil  in  the  minds  of
our youth the everlasting virtues of honesty,  discipline,  self-management,
mutual respect, leadership, etc, in programmes, namely  village  sport,  the
Peter Mokatla Memorial School Rugby Project, fitness and  health  programmes
and indigenous games and projects.

Although we  have  excellent  relationships  with  the  above  international
bodies, globalisation, unlike many want us to believe, also has  a  negative
impact on sport, where  sportspersons  are  increasingly  pushed  to  decide
between big multinational sponsors and their respective nation  states,  who
have invested a lot of resources and human capital in  them.  Patriotism  is
under serious threat, and  this  I  would  like  the  Minister  to  look  at
seriously.

The challenges still facing the  department  are  school  sports,  financial
resources, capacity-building both in administration and  at  athlete  level,
lack of sports and recreation playing facilities, and the link  between  the
South African  Sports  Commission,  provincial  federations  and  provincial
sport and recreation departments.

An amount of R14 million has been allocated to sports  from  the  provincial
budget for the financial year. The breakdown  is  as  follows,  although  it
does not add up: R600  000  will  go  to  village  sport  projects  for  the
empowerment of our rural communities; R280  000  go  for  the  promotion  of
netball; R150 000 for increased participation  in  the  development  of  the
physically challenged; R100 000 for  participation  by  individual  athletes
and organised teams in international events; R100 000  for  tournaments  and
coaching clinics; R289 000 for equipment for village sports -  that  is  our
rural communities; R200 000 to volunteers that will train  and  promote  our
recreational programmes; R200 000 towards  wellness/fitness  programmes  for
our province; R200 000 for participation in provincial and  national  events
for the physically challenged; R150 000 to train facilitators; R300 000  for
indigenous games; R1  000  000  for  ten  sportsgrounds  and  village  green
development. An amount of R8 million goes to district development.

In conclusion, the noble idea of volunteerism has its origin in the  drawing
up of the Freedom Charter of 1955. [Interjections.] This  those  members  do
not want to understand. This practice  of  volunteerism  has  been  followed
right throughout the years of the struggle. The call  of  1955  was  one  of
defiance against unjust laws. The call today is  to  assist  in  building  a
democratic, nonracial, nonsexist society. Vukuzenzele  serves  to  highlight
the fact that volunteers continue to occupy centre stage  in  improving  the
quality of life of our people, as we in the ANC have committed ourselves  to
a better life for all of our people. I would like to remind all  the  people
present here today that when we speak to our MEC, we should call her  Doctor
MEC Nosimo Beauty, the name that was given by the former  minority,  because
she is beautiful.

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members of this  House,  I  am
greatly honoured to deliver my maiden speech in this House today. I want  to
thank my party for this opportunity. I hope that I will  form  a  bond  with
members as my colleagues, in  the  interests  of  service  delivery  to  our
people. In these uncertain times, we should be a source of strength  to  our
people, with a vision of and dedication to their plight.

I am proud to say that the Western Cape is slowly but  surely  becoming  the
sports mecca of South Africa. With its world-class facilities, our  province
is the ideal venue  to  host  national,  as  well  as  international,  sport
events.

South Africa is a country of vast anomalies. It has poverty next to  wealth,
rich next  to  poor,  skilled  next  to  unskilled,  and  a  host  of  other
differences. We are a society in transition, excited about  change  and  the
possibilities change can bring future generations.

Sport and recreation avenues that can give our people focus  and  direction,
and assist  change.  Unfortunately,  only  5%  of  the  population  actively
participate in sport. With more facilities, as  well  as  sport  development
and changing attitudes, we can double this figure. The vision of  our  sport
and recreation fraternity is to ensure that the  socioeconomic  benefits  of
sports and recreation will ultimately lead to an overall improvement in  the
quality of life of all the people of the Western Cape and South Africa.

Today, as Africa stands on the threshold  of  its  Renaissance,  once  again
sport is playing a major role, because it is giving a new,  brighter  window
into the so-called continent of darkness. We  are  most  fortunate  that  we
live in a country whose people love sport,  and  we  are  equally  fortunate
that our continent in general provides the climate that allows sport  to  be
played almost all year round. As a consequence of these and  other  factors,
Africa has produced some of the world's greatest sporting  stars,  who  have
risen to the top despite emerging from very humble beginnings.

Here I would especially like to refer to our own  South  African  paralympic
team that performed so brilliantly in Sydney by bringing home a total of  38
medals. The 38 medals and the historic world records are an  inspiration  to
the nation  to  overcome  any  obstacles  we  may  face.  It  is  also  very
encouraging how our nation embraced our paralympic team.  In  the  words  of
former President Mandela, and current President Mbeki, we really need to  be
more supportive of all our international teams, win or lose. It will  be  of
considerable benefit to our sportsmen and women.

Die nuwe millennium hou vir ons baie belofte in, en ons  vertrou  dat  Suid-
Afrika in dié tydperk sy regmatige plek sal inneem in die wêreld van  sport.
Sport is vanselfsprekend nie die oplossing vir al  ons  probleme  nie,  maar
dit is duidelik dat die fasiliteite ook  baie  geleenthede  skep  buite  die
veld van sport.
Voordele  wat  daaruit   spruit,   kan   baie   bydra   om   kwessies   soos
vaardigheidsontwikkeling en werkskepping te steun en  het  groot  potensiaal
om die ekonomie van ons land te versterk. As ons  dit  wil  bereik,  is  dit
egter noodsaaklik dat daar behoorlike koördinasie en samewerking  moet  wees
wanneer sportgeleenthede in die Wes-Kaap en Suid-Afrika aangebied word.  Dit
is net so belangrik dat deelnemers  toegelaat  word  om  deel  te  neem,  en
toeskouers toegelaat word om die sportgebeure dop te hou in 'n omgewing  wat
gerieflik en veilig is.

Ons is nie langer bereid  om  enige  verdraagsaamheid  te  openbaar  teenoor
mense wat daarop ingestel is om die geleenthede vir die bevordering  en  die
welstand van ons mense te vernietig nie. Hierin het almal van ons 'n rol  om
te   speel,   individue,   families,   skole,   kerke,    gemeenskappe    en
staatsdepartmente.

Ons in die  Nuwe  NP  besef  dat  sport  alternatiewe  vir  misdaad  in  ons
gemeenskappe kan skep. Ons  steun  ten  volle,  en  is  aktief  betrokke  by
verskeie veldtogte teen misdaad wat op streekvlak en nasionaal  geloods  is.
Ten spyte daarvan dat ons sportstelsel nie volmaak is nie,  en  dat  dit  'n
paar inherente swak plekke  het,  het  dit  tog  sigbare  resultate  gelewer
sedert ons terugkeer na internasionale mededinging.  Dit  het  'n  nasionale
bewuswording gekweek en 'n gemeenskaplike trots by ons mense  gevestig.  Dit
het meer as enigiets anders gedoen ten opsigte van versoening en nasiebou.

Ek wil die agb Minister van Sport en Ontspanning verseker  dat  ons  in  die
Nuwe NP hom ten volle steun in die  uitbouing  van  die  positiewe  rol  wat
sport behoort te speel in die lewens van al ons  mense.  Daar  is  natuurlik
nog baie wat gedoen moet word, en ons het nog 'n lang pad om te  loop,  maar
as ons die regte beleid gereed het wat mense  kan  inspireer,  kan  ons  die
geesdrif onder ons mense wek om 'n nasie van sportliefhebbers te word.

Ek wil die agb Ministers en provinsiale ministers verseker van die  Nuwe  NP
se  steun  in  hierdie  verband.  [Applous.]   (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The new millennium holds much promise for  us,  and  we  trust  that  South
Africa will claim its rightful place in the world  of  sport  in  this  era.
Obviously, sport is not the solution to all our problems, but  it  is  clear
that the facilities also create many  opportunities  outside  the  world  of
sport.

Benefits resulting from this can contribute much to support issues  such  as
skills development and job creation and have much  potential  to  strengthen
the economy of our country. However, if we  want  to  achieve  this,  it  is
essential that there should be proper co-ordination  and  co-operation  when
sporting events are presented in the Western Cape and South  Africa.  It  is
just as important that participants  are  allowed  to  participate  in,  and
spectators are allowed to watch sporting events in a  comfortable  and  safe
environment.

We are no longer prepared to show any tolerance towards people whose aim  is
to destroy the opportunities for the advancement  and  the  welfare  of  our
people. All of us, individuals,  families,  schools,  churches,  communities
and government departments, have a role to play in this.

We in the New NP realise that sport can create alternatives to crime in  our
communities. We fully support and are actively  involved  in  various  anti-
crime campaigns that have been launched at regional and national levels.  In
spite of the fact that our sports system is not perfect, and that it  has  a
few inherently weak spots, it has nevertheless shown visible  results  since
our  return  to  international  competition.  It  has  created  a   national
awakening and established a collective pride  amongst  our  people.  It  has
done more than anything else  with  regard  to  reconciliation  and  nation-
building.

I want to assure the hon the Minister of Sport and  Recreation  that  we  in
the New NP give him our full support in developing the  positive  role  that
sport should play in the lives of all our people. Obviously there  is  still
a lot to be done, and we still have a long way to go, but  if  we  have  the
right policy in place that can inspire people we can awaken  the  enthusiasm
amongst our people so that we can become a nation of sports enthusiasts.

I want to assure the hon Ministers and provincial ministers of  the  support
of the New NP in this regard. [Applause.]]

Ms  F  N  MAZIBUKO  (Gauteng):  Ngiyabonga  Mhlalangaphambili  [Thank   you,
Chairperson], firstly, I wish to indicate to  the  Minister  that  I  looked
with interest at the  composition  of  his  department,  especially  at  the
senior decision-making positions. I noticed with interest that it is  mostly
men, except for one rose amongst  the  thorns.  This  does  not  necessarily
reflect the gender balance of this country, where women make up 51%  of  the
population, as opposed to men, who make up 48%  of  the  population  in  our
country.

We as Gauteng await with anticipation the policy document on women in  sport
which is still in draft form, as the Minister has indicated. Going  back  to
my earlier comments on the composition in relation to gender, no  wonder  it
took so long to get this draft document. We hope the  Minister  will  commit
himself and the department to making  sure  that  all  sporting  codes  will
reflect the participation of women and their  representation  and  that  the
favourite sport of us as women, which is netball, is not  only  declared  an
exhibition sport in Commonwealth countries, but  is  also  recognised  as  a
sport that will get awards. In short, we must encourage our young  women  to
participate.

In this financial year of 2002-03 in Gauteng, we  are  looking  more  at  an
integrated approach through the concepts of co-operative governance,  social
services strategy and joint programmes on, for instance,  HIV/Aids  and  the
rehabilitation, maintenance and upgrading of facilities. The budget aims  at
contributing  to  economic  growth,  infrastructure  development   and   job
creation, addressing backlogs,  and  showing  good  governance  and  nation-
building  and  the  commitment  of  the  Gauteng  provincial  government  to
building a culturally diverse,  but  united,  democratic  nonracial  nation,
proud of its heritage - a nation that unleashes its  potential  and  is  not
hindered  in  achieving  its  goal  and  participation   in   the   economic
mainstream, thus creating a better future and a better life for all.

In this financial year, the financial support that we get from the  national
department to the tune of R7 million will go a long way towards  alleviating
poverty,  especially  in  providing  and  upgrading  sports  and  recreation
facilities. While our intentions might be good, the  question  we  must  ask
ourselves is whether our plans and programmes are designed  and  implemented
in such a way that they  give  meaning  to  our  intentions.  We  have  made
positive strides in addressing  sports  and  recreation  challenges  in  our
province. Today there is a  bigger  pool  of  participation  at  grass-roots
level  through  the  Masakhane  games.  These   games   seek   to   increase
participation  in  high-performance  sports  and   focus   on   youth   from
disadvantaged communities, amongst whom we will identify those  with  talent
and channel them to our academic programme.

The South African Games will also help to compare these athletes with  those
who come from other provinces. Our intention is to contribute to a  pool  of
athletes that this country will send to the international  competition.  The
sports  academy  that  we  have  in  our  province  has  the  objectives  of
identifying and nurturing  talent  to  develop  and  enhance  the  level  of
performance  of  our  identified  talents,  to  transform  the   demographic
composition of our South  African  teams  and  to  provide  quality  support
services to our athletes. We are going to focus on four  sporting  codes  in
these academies, that is, athletics, swimming, cricket  and  rugby.  Already
we have  also  developed  partnerships  with  our  federations,  educational
institutions and, most importantly, the SA Sports  Commission  in  realising
this dream.

We thank Sports and Recreation South Africa and  the  SA  Sports  Commission
for the  support  they  have  given  the  province  in  the  development  of
facilities at local level, the provincial championships, the  administration
of federation, the international events  hosted  by  our  province  and  the
academy programmes. Without this assistance we would not be  able  to  stand
here and talk about these success stories. While women  -  especially  young
women - are going to be at the centre of our academies, we  have  identified
netball as the most important sporting code for the development  of  women's
sports in our province.

Netball will receive funds to enable them to  form  structures  and  vibrant
league systems that will allow  maximum  competition  and  development.  The
South African Indigenous Games was launched in Qwaqwa. In  our  province  we
have decided to co-ordinate training for our heritage societies,  so  as  to
ensure that we have a team of people who understand these  games  before  we
launch our programme in our province. We  are  at  present  focusing  on  an
advocacy programme. At this point in time, our attention is mainly  directed
to the rural areas as our entry point, before we move to urban areas.  There
are specific indigenous games that have moved at  a  much  faster  pace  and
have formed their associations and have competitions like  the  dibeke,  our
black cricket.
In the spirit of volunteerism, our sports and recreation have  gone  a  long
way in our history of volunteerism. Many of the  people  that  were  running
sports and recreation have volunteered and some are  still  volunteering  up
until today. We are nurturing this spirit, but we are developing a  pool  of
volunteers, especially for our competitions and provincial games.

There are a number of developmental initiatives from the private sector  and
civil society that complement our development. There  are  individuals  like
Linda Buthelezi, our former Bafana Bafana star, who has engaged in  vigorous
development programmes in our  area,  especially  in  Heidelberg,  which  is
always forgotten by our well-resourced  groupings.  This  is  an  indication
that our Vukuzenzele programmes  are  actually  making  strides  within  our
province. We thank all these good South Africans, and hope that many  others
will follow in their footsteps and help us to  remove  these  big  stumbling
blocks within the shortest space of time.

While we  need  to  highlight  our  successes,  we  also  need  to  look  at
challenges we are faced with, so as to be able to  deliver  successfully  to
the masses of our people. There  is  a  need  for  more  facilities  in  the
previously disadvantaged communities. We need to focus  on  the  development
of clubs if we are to sustain development programmes. We need to  train  our
coaches, administrators and technical officials through  appropriate  sports
education. We need to  change  the  present  composition  of  our  teams  to
reflect both the provincial and national  demographics.  We  should  improve
communication between us as the Government and between  Government  and  our
stakeholders. I would like to go on and on, but time will not  allow  me  to
do so. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members  of  this  House,
the main objective of sports and recreation is to  improve  the  quality  of
life of all South Africans by promoting their participation, and  increasing
the  probable  success  of  their   sportspersons   and   teams   in   major
international competitions.

These objectives are pursued with the co-operation  of  the  various  sports
structures and are furthermore linked to certain priorities that  have  been
set by Government, the first being poverty  alleviation.  By  hosting  major
international sports events and promoting sports tourism,  many  jobs  could
be created, resulting in income generation.

Secondly moral regeneration can be achieved by  involving  young  people  in
sports and recreation programmes in which they can  learn  the  values  that
form the moral fabric of society.  On  the  other  hand,  political  parties
should not allow their young  people  to  hurl  insults  and  abuse  at  the
leaders of other  political  parties  for  their  own  expediency,  as  this
practice ultimately leads to the moral degeneration of our youth.

The  third  priority  is  marketing  South  Africa.  Through  the   enhanced
performance of South African sportspersons and the hosting of  international
sporting events, our country could be marketed abroad.

It is gratifying to note that the budget  allocation  for  the  building  of
sports and recreation facilities nationally  has  been  increased  from  R40
million in the 2001-02 financial year to about R90 million  in  the  2002-03
financial year. I also wish to join the chorus of applause directed  at  the
hon the Minister, not only for this increase of the  budget,  but  also  for
his   enthusiastic   and   energetic   approach    to    his    departmental
responsibilities.

An issue of great concern to us across the party-political spectrum  is  the
underutilisation of two sports facilities in Mafikeng and Odi in  the  North
West. However, I was partly comforted recently, when I read in the  Mafikeng
Mail that the  hon  Mayisele,  MEC  for  sports  and  recreation,  was  also
concerned about the underutilisation of these  facilities.  They  have  been
built with the taxpayers' money and the taxpayers must get value  for  their
money.

In conclusion, I wish to appeal to the hon the  Minister  and  the  relevant
sports structures to join hands in mobilising for the maximum use  of  these
facilities. [Applause.]

Mr M W MFEBE (Free State): Chairperson, hon members, I stand here  imagining
myself standing in front of the mirror and saying: ``Hey, boy,  are  you  in
the old South Africa, or are you in the new South Africa?'' when I hear  hon
members in this  august  House  argue  very  strongly,  and  believing  very
strongly, that being black is equal to being substandard  and  inferior  and
that, therefore, we must maintain the  current  composition  of  our  teams,
irrespective of the demographics of our country. [Interjections.]

This will never happen for  as  long  as  the  ANC  is  the  leader  of  the
Government in this country. We will change society and give benefits to  all
South Africans based on merit. There is a silly notion in  this  country  in
that people think that being black is being inferior and being  substandard.
[Interjections.]

The question of representativity has been addressed a  number  of  times  by
the national Minister. People tend to conveniently distort it to  mean  that
token blacks who are  in  the  team  will  mean  competent  people  who  can
represent South  Africa.  Who  would  want  to  put  a  person  to  swim  in
competition with Penny Heyns if that person was not competent  in  swimming?
She would drown and die. Who would want that to happen? We want a  competent
person to compete with another South African, irrespective of colour.

Allow me to make my contribution within the context of the Free State  White
Paper and the Free State Development  Plan,  whose  policy  frameworks  both
refer to two important aspects which are the priorities of  the  Free  State
government:   firstly,   people   development   and,   secondly,    economic
development. In order to realise people development to sport and  recreation
in the  Free  State  province,  we  have  put  in  place  three  interactive
strategies.  Without  constant  interface  with   those   strategies   sport
advancement would be a pipe dream in the province and  in  the  country  for
that matter.
The strategies are, firstly, the provision of sports  facilities,  secondly,
opportunities for  mass  participation  and  creation  of  competition,  and
thirdly, the academy assisting.

On the question of sports facilities I want  to  use  the  example  of  Mark
Shuttleworth. Mark Shuttleworth, with the best will in the world, would  not
have been successful in realising his dream of getting into space without  a
facility, that is the capsule in which  he  jetted  into  space.  Similarly,
without sports facilities, our dreams as a province or as a country, or  the
dreams of an individual athlete, will never be realised.

In the words of the late Comrade Steve Tshwete: ``You cannot teach  a  child
to swim in bed.'' One has to provide a swimming pool in which to  teach  the
child - a facility. So, therefore, the creation  of  facilities  is  of  key
importance in the sport development continuum if we are to succeed  in  this
country. The question is: What have we done in the  Free  State  to  realise
this important aspect?

Since 1994 we have spent a total of R135,5 million on sports facilities,  of
course with a little help from our friends in the  national  department  ...
[Laughter] ... benefiting 72,2% of the Free State communities. However,  the
challenge remains the vandalism that takes place in  these  communities.  It
is for this reason that  I  call  on  communities,  wherever  they  are,  to
preserve what is truly theirs. The communities are provided with  Government
programmes truly belonging to  those  communities.  There  is  no  need  for
anyone to steal from themselves. We must preserve these facilities.

Secondly, on the  question  of  opportunities  for  mass  participation  and
competition, the strategic  platform  which  we  have  embarked  on  is  the
Masakane Games,  which  serve  as  a  comprehensive  talent  identification,
selection and nurturing system for elite performance in order  to  draw  all
the athletes in the province into the mainstream of sport.

To date we have processed, through these games, 126 000 youths, and this  is
important, because we capture them during school holidays.  As  hon  members
know, the Minister has alluded to the fact that school sport  is  still  the
responsibility of the Department of Education, in  terms  of  both  physical
education and competitive aspects, but we  look  at  after-school  hours  to
involve these youngsters. The best time is  during  school  holidays,  where
these competitions are important.

This is also important in respect of the question of moral  regeneration  in
the country. As we know, sport plays an important  role  and  teaches  young
people many social lessons, the value of teamwork, of co-operation, of  team
spirit, the need to abide by rules and regulations, and how to take  victory
or defeat with good grace. Those are the values that are  necessary  in  the
classroom situation, in communities and wherever we  are  as  a  people.  We
have embarked on this system.

Linked to that is the question of identifying talent,  as  these  games  are
taking place to feed into the  academic  system.  The  academy,  as  we  are
probably aware, is high-performance-centred. It is a  school  of  excellence
that transforms alleged potential into realised talent  by  putting  certain
programmes into place. In the Free State we process 2 000 people  per  annum
in the various areas on which the academy is concentrating,  from  coaching,
athlete conditioning, and technical officiating to women in sport. There  is
also sports psychology to empower people to take charge of their own  lives,
especially in so far as life skills are concerned.

This is important, because, as  I  have  said,  for  the  sport  development
continuum one needs facilities, one cannot do anything  without  facilities.
We should address that. We need to create opportunities for  competition  so
that people can compete, so that we can select them and  put  them  in  this
fast-track, scientific and  sustainable  development  programme  within  the
academy system itself.

The other priority which I mentioned is economic development.  I  think  the
Minister has often in the past made a case  for  sport's  role  in  economic
development. In this particular instance we  concentrate  in  terms  of  the
Free State Development Plan and the Free State White Paper on Sport  Tourism
which we have embarked on in terms of a project  concerning  the  motorcycle
Grand Prix.

I am happy to report to hon members that this  programme  has  yielded  good
results which are important to note in this august House.  So  far  we  have
had four Grand Prix events in the Free State, in Welkom, which marketed  the
province and the country to a total audience of 1,4 billion  people  in  200
countries. South Africa and the Free State have received a total of  14  609
minutes on television.  If  the  Free  State,  and  South  Africa,  were  to
purchase  this  exposure,  it  would  have  cost,  based  on  South  African
advertising rates of R28 000 per  minute,  R306,8  million  per  event.  All
those events total a value of R1,23 billion in terms of  exposure  that  the
country has received.

We have, through the four events, brought to the Free State, and to  Welkom,
20  000  foreign  tourists  from  outside  the   country.   Based   on   the
international formula ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Ms J  L  KGOALI:  Chairperson,  I  cannot  start  my  speech  without  first
responding in one line to the hon member Raju - just one  line,  because  my
colleague the hon MEC from the Free State has addressed some of the  issues.
I just want to ask the hon member who said that other people of other  races
had no capacity or capability. That is the question that  I  want  to  leave
with him. [Interjections.] Transformation. [Laughter.]

Mr N M RAJU: May I answer? [Laughter.]

Ms J L KGAOLI: No, the hon member will answer me outside. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Kgoali, you have the floor, not Mr  Raju,
so continue.

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, thank you. Transformation in  sport  for  us  as
the ruling party involves  more  than  just  the  attainment  of  unity.  It
involves a fundamental paradigm shift in which certain pillars practice,  as
it is not putting a couple of black  faces  in  teams,  the  federation  and
committees. Nor is it cooking up some half-baked development  programme  and
selling it as redressing imbalances.

I want to say, in honesty, that the only  sport  in  this  country  that  is
showing preparedness for transformation is soccer. They are doing  all  they
can to ensure that they accommodate everybody, but with the others it  is  a
different story.

We are aware  that  in  certain  quarters  transformation  is  equated  with
mediocrity. There is also a school of  thought  that  equates  it  with  the
quota system,  at  the  expense  of  what  is,  in  historically  advantaged
circles, known as excellence. However, we are not averse to these  kinds  of
sentiments and are more than ready  to  discuss  this  apparent  resistance,
these insecurities and discomforts with whoever  is  not  sure  of  what  he
wants to see, or to show what we are doing in this  country.  Sadly  enough,
reality dictates otherwise, and more often than not we are  accused  of  not
meeting the expectations of aspiring and budding young black  sportsmen  and
sportswomen.
I wish to state that the neglect  of  the  women's  sports  constituency  in
South Africa is  an  issue  of  serious  concern.  In  our  encounters  with
sportswomen,  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas,  we  are   informed   that
transformation and development only benefit those who  also  benefited  from
apartheid sports. Historically  disadvantaged  sportswomen  suffered  triple
doses of discrimination. I  do  not  want  to  mention  that.  During  these
encounters we are also, almost as a rule, faced with accusations of  racism,
prejudice,  disrespect,  lack  of  commitment  by  federations,  etc.  As  a
consequence the levels of black women participating in sport are in  serious
decline.

What we find even more disconcerting is that  discrimination  against  women
extends beyond the playgrounds. It also manifests itself  in  the  corporate
sector and the media, especially the electronic media. Week in and week  out
viewers and television license-holders are being fed an overdose  of  brawn,
muscle and male vanity. This represents sexism in the  extreme.  An  example
of  this  insensitivity  happened  during  the   senior   national   netball
championships in my constituency in Pretoria during August of last year.  As
more than 600 players assembled and vied for  honours  in  this  prestigious
competition, the media, both print and electronic, decided  to  boycott  it.
We would  like  to  believe  that  the  public  broadcaster  has  a  special
responsibility in this regard.

During the last continental women's football championships, Banyana  Banyana
demonstrated that they have what it takes to compete at  the  highest  level
by reaching the final of this competition,  and  they  gave  every  football
lover in this country sheer  pleasure  with  their  ball  skills,  pace  and
stamina - more, I am sure, than my hon colleague Raju. These girls can run.

Also, Dikeledi Moropani was the only black South African female  athlete  of
note who, although she did not win any of the sprints, gave a  good  account
of herself in the recent Absa series, and yet  schoolchildren  do  not  even
know about this person. It is a shame for us as a country. Moreover, in  the
early nineties we had the likes of Evelina  Tshabalala,  Blanche  Moila  and
Marcelle Winkler, who made us proud when they notched up victories in  their
respectives disciplines. Since they have  retired,  there  are  no  apparent
successors to their thrones.

It is such inconsistencies that make women sportspersons lose  interest  and
become suspicious of the status quo. Moreover, we will have to do  something
drastic to take so-called high-profile sports events and championships  back
to disadvantaged communities. This situation is portraying a false image  of
our society when black people have to go to affluent suburbs to  watch  such
events. Women's sports have the potential  to  rebuild  broken  and  divided
communities.

I want to call on Sport and Recreation South Africa  to  address  this  very
serious issue  as  a  priority.  However  much  we  are  encouraged  by  the
inclusion of and provision  for  women  in  their  Building  for  Sport  and
Recreation project, we would like to see  policy  guidelines.  It  must  not
remain a draft paper for all time. We  want  to  see  it  taking  shape  and
getting into the provinces and being implemented.

Transformation is indeed futile when we rant and rave about lily-white  male
national teams and nothing is being said or done publicly about  the  racial
composition of, for instance, our hockey team. It is a disgrace that we  can
see a hockey team of that nature in South Africa as a rainbow nation.

On the whole, Sport and Recreation South  Africa  have  indeed  proved  that
they are heeding  our  President's  call  to  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty. They have consistently  demonstrated  an  unfailing  commitment  to
this end. Their Building for  Sports  and  Recreation  programme  is  indeed
proof of this and  will  ensure  that  democracy,  nonracialism,  nonsexism,
access, equity and transformation are sustained.

There is an outcry in Gauteng, in the area of Midrand  in  Khayalami,  where
the community, much as they are situated in a rich area, are crying out  for
a simple facility, namely a sports ground. The  owners  of  the  place,  who
have lots of money, cannot even contribute two  poles  for  the  playing  of
soccer. This is one matter in which we are also looking to the Hon  Minister
to call people to work together and assist every  province  with  regard  to
the facilities which are needed in those areas. Although people feel  -  as,
perhaps, the hon the minister himself does - that Gauteng  is  a  much  more
advantaged province, there are still problems  in  Gauteng,  and  we  cannot
deny that. [Time expired.]

Mr S B NGIDI (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Minister, colleagues,  may  I
begin by  commending  the  Minister  on  the  budget  speech  which  he  has
delivered this afternoon. I am always enthused and  encouraged  by  the  hon
the Minister of Sport and Recreation because of the enthusiasm  he  actually
puts into driving this particular  portfolio.  I  only  wish  that  kind  of
enthusiasm could be injected into our various  sporting  bodies,  both  into
the administration and into the players, so that we could actually begin  to
become the proud South Africa that we used to be.
I met people from Australia recently and I decided that I was not  going  to
talk about rugby and cricket, although  they  wanted  to  talk  about  those
particular things, for various obvious reasons.

One of the things which always come to mind when  I  think  about  sport  is
development. I have actually made my own yardstick. It might be a very  poor
yardstick. I always look at tennis. Whom  do  I  associate  with  tennis  in
South Africa? The names that would just come to mind are Wayne Ferreira  and
Amanda Coetzer. I have no  problem  with  these  athletes,  but  I  seem  to
remember that almost all the people who played with them have  retired.  Are
they in England or in Germany or any other European countries? It  tells  me
that with regard to programmes of development in this  particular  area,  we
still have a long way to go.  We  still  have  only  those  people  in  that
particular area.

I agree with the Minister's  approach  towards  co-operative  governance.  I
know that sport is a form of provincial competence but we  still  have  this
particular problem that we are one country and we want  to  transform.  Yet,
at the same time we also want to  develop  and  open  up  opportunities  for
everybody to actually develop to the maximum.

One of the things  that  we  are  always  talking  about  is  the  issue  of
facilities and resources. I know that local government  is  doing  something
about it, whereas provincial government should be doing something  about  it
to a level that is so  encouraging  that  different  things  happen.  In  my
province, if we look at Nomvete and Zuma, they are township  boys  and  they
have come to where they are because there were these facilities  where  they
grew up.

I also realise that the only people going up in sport  in  the  rural  areas
are those who are in medium-distance and  long-distance  running.  One  only
needs legs in order to run. They have a particular talent.  If  one  is  far
away from that rural setting, then opportunities  for  sport  are  very  far
removed. I can mention Sizwe Mataung and Herman Kelele, who  ultimately  got
to those levels and who are from the Newcastle  area.  There  are  very  few
facilities available for them.

As we try to say that we need development in sport, and  we  should  develop
people who otherwise would not have a chance, the question of facilities  is
thus very important. Any facility which we put in the deep rural areas  will
actually help to  bring  a  calibre  of  people  up  to  certain  levels  of
development. It not only helps the family, it also helps the area  in  which
those people are.

We would also support, in our own small way,  any  measures  which  say:  We
need to improve facilities for our various people as we  develop.  We  watch
wonderful soccer during the weekend, but what happens  is  that  the  people
come from all over the country to watch that. In the province we would  have
people driving from the North Coast area or the Ladysmith-Newcastle area  or
from Potchefstroom upwards. Bafana Bafana  has  a  lot  of  support  in  our
province. We built a beautiful stadium in Newcastle and if  we  sent  Bafana
Bafana to that, they would all be back. [Applause.]
Mr H T SOGONI:  Chairperson,  Minister  and  members,  in  participating  in
today's debate, we should remember to pay special tribute  to  the  late  Mr
Steve Tshwete, one of the fierce campaigners, who  exerted  his  efforts  to
liberate the country, not only from political  domination,   but  also  from
its fragmented apartheid sports policies and structures that  were  designed
to advance racial division in society. This was done to effectively  protect
the  minority,  whilst  depriving  the  rest  of  the  citizens   of   equal
opportunity, mainly in the area of sport.

As the  first  Minister  of  Sport  and  Recreation  in  the  new  political
dispensation, the late Mr Tshwete greatly assisted the country in  laying  a
new foundation on which we could begin to address the problems of the  past.
Today we are able to sing the praises of all sports heroes and champions  in
one voice, with pride that together we  play to make South Africa a  winning
nation.

The department has  clearly  outlined  three  programmes  in  terms  of  its
strategic plan as well as the  estimates  for  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure
Framework. Of particular interest  to  me  are  programmes  on  the  funding
policy and liaison and the Building for Sport and Recreation  programme.  In
terms of the programme on funding the UDM appreciates  that  the  department
recognises the significance of co-operation between itself and  the  various
national sports bodies and federations and other service providers in  order
to achieve the objective of improving the quality of life through  increased
participation in sport and increasing  the  number  of  successes  of  South
African  teams  and  individual  participants  in  major  events   and   the
successful hosting of international events as well.

The realisation of such goals, in my view, however, remains a pipe dream  if
other role-players themselves do not share  the  same  commitment  with  the
department and do not put their house in  order.  An  example  that  quickly
comes to mind is the  one  that  the  hon  the  Minister  has  already  paid
attention to in his latest media statement, namely the Safa-PSL fiasco.  The
UDM fully supports the Minister in his  clear  and  unambiguous  message  to
these football structures, which in my language I could  interpret  to  mean
``opetheyo makapathe, opetheyo aphateke.'' [The leader  must  lead  and  the
follower must follow.]

Without  the  co-operation  and  commitment   of   all   the   stakeholders,
performance standards will certainly drop. The country will  slide  down  in
world rankings and our national pride and reputation as  a  sporting  nation
will fade away. Transfer payments of 86,3% of the total expenditure in  this
programme for 2002-03 are an indication that the department is committed  to
providing her partners with the  necessary  means  to  play  their  role  in
meeting the targets. The UDM supports this endeavour.

The programme deals with a variety of key issues  on  the  basis  which  the
real challenges  of  the  ongoing  processes  of  transformation  should  be
viewed. This programme embarks on facility provision  through  the  Building
for Sport and Recreation project. According  to  SA  Yearbook  2001-02  this
project is another phase in the Government's  determination  to  deliver  in
areas where the needs are the greatest, in an attempt  to  bridge  the  gaps
that exist between rural and urban communities.

Projects in this programme therefore have been identified in line  with  the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme strategy  and  the  Urban
Renewal Programme, which seek to address issues of  critical  importance  to
the majority of people in South Africa. I can  only  mention  a  few:  moral
regeneration, which has already been mentioned; crime prevention  ...  [Time

Mr P C McKENZIE (Western Cape): Chairperson, Minister, members,  it  is,  of
course, a great privilege for me  to  return  to  this  important  House  of
Parliament to present the Western Cape's vision for  sport  and  recreation.
Also, my congratulations to our colleague  from  the  Western  Cape  on  his
maiden speech today. I congratulate him on his speech.  [Interjections.]  As
a province and a department we are committed  to  ensuring  that  sport  and
recreation are used as tools to better the lives of all our citizens.

It is our belief that by investing in sport we are able  to  improve  safety
and security in our communities, through providing healthy  alternatives  to
antisocial behaviour, particularly amongst our youth; to improve the  health
and welfare of all our citizens by providing  opportunities  to  participate
in sport to all age groups; to contribute to the growth of  our  economy  by
promoting sport and tourism; and to invest  in  important  capital  projects
that focus on ensuring that the  Western  Cape  establishes  itself  as  the
sports mecca of Africa.

That we are making good progress in this  regard  is  quite  clear,  if  one
takes into consideration our representation  in  national  sport  teams,  be
that rugby, softball, soccer, cricket or bowls, to name a few,  as  well  as
on the administration side, not to mention the fact that  the  province  has
been chosen to host the opening ceremony of next year's Cricket  World  Cup,
after our success in hosting the opening of the 1995 Rugby  World  Cup  here
in this province.

It is  pleasing  to  announce  that,  as  a  result  of  the  new  political
dispensation in the Western Cape, a new level of co-operation has  developed
between  our  province's  sports   department   and   national   and   local
institutions dealing with sports.  [Applause.]  This  new  approach  to  co-
operate with all tiers of government is bearing positive  results  and  will
continue to do so in this province.

Furthermore, we have established three regional sports councils, as well  as
an  overarching  provincial  sports  forum.  In  order  to  improve  service
delivery to our various communities, we have  opened  in  the  Western  Cape
three new regional offices, one in the  Boland-Overberg  area,  one  on  the
West Coast and the  other  at  Hartleyvale  for  the  Cape  metropole  area.
Earlier we established an office in Oudtshoorn for the South Cape area.

The  unsatisfactory  level  of  participation  in  sport  among  our  youth,
especially at schools, is a major concern  to  my  department.  Hon  members
will agree with us that this is something we cannot  afford  in  a  province
where youths so easily fall prey to gangsterism  -  to  quote  writer  James
Baldwin: ``The wonder is not that so many  are  ruined,  but  that  so  many
survive.''

I am  therefore  particularly  proud  to  announce  that  the  Western  Cape
provincial government, different  to  a  lot  of  other  provinces  -  other
provinces should also take the lead  here  -  has  recently  adopted  a  new
school sports policy. This policy in essence means that  the  Department  of
Sport and Recreation will be responsible for all school  sports,  while  the
Department of Education will be responsible for physical education.  Through
this relationship between Sport and Recreation, and Education, we will  give
effect to the slogan ``a child in sport is a child out of court.''

To this end,  I  would  like  to  reaffirm  the  Western  Cape  government's
viewpoint that the beautiful revamped Athlone stadium should be the home  of
soccer in this province. This, however, does not exclude  any  other  events
from taking place at the stadium. We are  committed  to  ensuring  that  the
immediate communities should benefit from any  activities  or  events  being
held at that venue. We would  also  like  to  thank  the  Minister  for  his
involvement in that.

With regard to the future management of the Athlone stadium, my  department,
the City of Cape Town and SAFA Western Province meet on a  weekly  basis  to
finalise the agreement in respect of the matter, and good progress has  been
made  in  this  regard.  They  are  also  in  the  process  of  planning  an
appropriate official opening at Athlone and  we  will  definitely  need  the
Minister's support and help that we  may  even  get  Bafana  Bafana  at  the
opening match here in Cape Town.

In  conclusion,  allow  me  to  turn  to  the  very   important   issue   of
transformation in sport. Sadly, a decade into democracy, many of  our  sport
codes lag behind with respect to transformation and development.  I  believe
it is time that we bring an end to lip service in terms  of  transformation.
Earlier this year, when I delivered my own budget speech in  the  provincial
legislature, I specifically pointed to the  so-called  elite  sports,  those
which have for many years being regarded as sports  for  the  wealthy  only,
and which have been allowed to get away with virtual murder,  while  we  are
concentrating only on rugby and cricket in terms of transformation.

My  department  has  subsequently  instituted  measures   to   ensure   that
transformation  and  development  are  taken  seriously  by  all  our  sport
federations, particularly when it  applies  to  the  involvement  of  women,
black and disabled persons. However, I agree with the hon MEC,  we  are  not
talking about tokenism. I believe that  those  who  are  black  have  proved
themselves on the sport fields over and over again and those people must  be
given an opportunity to represent their country. [Interjections.]

Furthermore, we will be hosting a sports indaba  with  all  stakeholders  in
the latter half of this year, where we  will  collectively  reflect  on  the
progress made to date, as well as future requirements.  This  sports  indaba
will monitor how transformation takes place in all sporting  codes  in  this
province.
I want to thank hon members. My time is up and I appreciate having had  this
opportunity to speak. Our congratulations go to the  Minister  on  doing  an
excellent job in this department. [Applause.]

Mr M MTHIMKHULU (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson and hon members, as a  KwaZulu-
Natal special delegate, one regards this debate as  of  primary  importance.
Sport and recreation are vital, especially in expediting nation-building  in
our country, which still bears  visible  scars  of  the  inhuman  system  of
apartheid which divided us as a people along racial lines for decades.

There are still communities without basic sports and recreation  facilities,
let alone having these in our schools  in  the  province  of  KwaZulu-Natal,
which  is,  as  hon  members  know,  largely  rural.  One  can  hardly  find
facilities for sports and recreation in  those  areas.  One  will  only  see
those young men and women playing soccer, because soccer only  needs  a  few
logs and a patch of area to set up a soccer field. It is therefore of  vital
importance to dwell on the issue of facilities.
We will all recall that KwaZulu-Natal was a province that was torn apart  by
apartheid state-sponsored political violence. Thus, I am short of  words  to
underscore how significant sport and recreation are  to  my  province  as  a
vehicle for reconciliation. We need  vigorously  to  revamp  our  policy  on
sport and recreation. In my province, since education is underfunded,  sport
and recreation,  as  a  directorate  of  the  department  of  education  and
culture, is suffering immensely

In my province one will find that sport and recreation  will  not  even  get
half a slice of the budget. That has a negative impact on us, a  because  we
need to reinforce sports, as I said earlier, as  a  means  of  consolidating
reconciliation in this province, which was  once  torn  apart  by  political
violence.

I must say, the situation  right  now  is  that  the  sport  and  recreation
directorate does not have enough of  the  budget.  To  us  that  is  a  real
disservice to our people, because sport and recreation are  treated  as  the
stepdaughter in our province.

One is encouraged by the Minister's commitment  to  co-operative  governance
and hopes that if the Minister puts a lot of work  into  ensuring  that  the
problems encountered in this regard, in as far as sport and  recreation  are
concerned in our province, are addressed so that we  will  all  be  able  to
realise the importance of sport in our society.

Although the Minister announced a 55% increase  in  this  year's  budget,  I
feel strongly that there must be  more  budgetary  bias  towards  sport  and
recreation so that that will cascade down  to  provinces.  I  think  a  firm
national policy to ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs J  N  VILAKAZI:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  it  is
interesting to speak  about  one  of  the  creative  activities  enjoyed  by
communities around the world. The Minister's budget  speech  is  encouraging
and gives us hope. A wide range of sports  activities  is  enjoyed  by  both
players and spectators, either as individuals or groups of people  according
to their common interests. A sport which is not practised  or  promoted  can
never develop; it may as well be dead or not exist.

I salute our hon Minister of Sport and Recreation because he does  not  have
that designation in name only, but  is  visible  on  the  ground  as  he  is
usually where the sport is. Some people are talented in certain sports,  but
owing to a lack of financial support and recognition fail to  develop  their
talents accordingly. The Minister in  his  budget  will  be  doing  a  great
service to the nation and also extending his  great  talent  by  identifying
such people, especially in  the  underdeveloped  areas  of  our  society  by
giving assistance according to their identified  needs.  By  so  doing,  the
country  will  benefit  a  lot  when  these  people,  after   training   and
development, start ploughing their skills back into their communities.

Sizalwa  yizizwe  ezinamasiko  ahlukene.  Ekukhuleni   kwethu   kwakunezinto
eziningi zokuvocavoca umzimba esasizenza.Imali  yayingekho  futhi  nezikhulu
ezazikhona  zazingakunakile  ukuthuthukisa  ezemidlalo,   ikakhulu   kithina
luhlanga olunsundu.

Emakhaya kukhona intsha ezivocavoca ngezindlela eziningi.  Uma  kungenamuntu
onakekela leyo midlalo yayo, igcina ishabalele. Siyazi ukuthi umdlalo  odume
kakhulu  ibhola  lezinyawo  kanti  naleli  lomnqakiswano  seliyaqala   ngoba
linakekelwe. Sincoma uHulumeni owelula isandla  ezimalini  ukuze  ezemidlalo
zidlondlobale. Umdushuzwano lona oyibhola lombhoxo  usuqalile  ukuheha  labo
abawuthandayo, ikhilikithi neminye.

UNgqongqoshe nomnyango wakhe abake baqinise isandla  sabo,  ikakhulu  kulabo
abasafufusa nabangenawo amandla okuzifukula noma benalo ikhono.  Laba  phela
abasemakhaya. Anibobanaka,  inkunzi  isematholeni  njengoba  kade  esho  nje
umhlonishwa   engimlandele.   Inkunzi   isematholeni,   bagcwele    emakhaya
esizonqoba ngabo.

Abantu abadala bona benzani? Asiyiboni imidlalo yabo. Nabo  banawo  amakhono
abangawasebenzisa. Mhlawumbe ne-high  blood  pressure,  ushukela  nenhliziyo
kungathikaziseka. [Ubuwelewele.]

Ngiyacela  mina  kuNgqongqoshe   ukuthi   asebekhulile,   abanayo   imidlalo
yokuqinisa imizimba, banikezwe ithuba.  Kuyimpilo  lokhu.  Mina  njengelungu
lomphakathi elibe ngumhlengikazi iminyaka eminingi,  kuye  kungiphathe  kabi
ukuzwa ukuthi umdlali webhola odumile akasakwazi ukungena  adlale,  iminyaka
yakhe  ayisamvumeli.  Uma  iminyaka   ingasamvumeli,   usezokwenzani   ngoba
ungumthandi womdlalo? Liphi iqembu leminyaka yakhe asezongena kulo?

Umshayisibhakela  onekhono  usedinga   umhlalaphansi,   bese   enzani   emva
kwalokho? Liphi iqembu azongena kulo  aqhube  ikhono  lakhe?  Umuntu  ugcina
lapho  esevule  ibhizinisi,  iqale  i-high  blood  pressure  nezinye   izifo
ezenziwa  ukuswela  ukuvocavoca  umzimba,  aye  kudokotela  bese   udokotela
emtshela ukuthi udinga ukuthi avocavoce  umzimba  noma  ahambahambe  ayaluze
nje. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[We come from different nations. When we  grew  up,  there  were  a  lot  of
things that we did to exercise our  bodies.  There  was  no  money  and  the
officials did not care about promoting sport, especially for black people.

In the rural areas there are young  people  who  exercise  their  bodies  in
different ways. If no one takes care of the  sports  that  they  play,  they
will eventually disappear. We know  that  the  popular  sports,  soccer  and
netball, are only starting to kick off  because  they  were  overlooked.  We
applaud the Government, which extended a financial hand  to  promote  sport.
Rugby has stated to attract those who like it, as well as cricket and  other
kinds of sport.

The  Minister  and  his  department  should  intensify  their   involvement,
especially relating to the amateurs who do not  have  the  power  to  uplift
themselves although they have the talent. These are the rural  people.  Take
care of them; the leaders of tomorrow are among the young people  of  today,
as the hon member said on whom I  followed.  The  leaders  of  tomorrow  are
among the youth of today. There are a lot  of  people  in  the  rural  areas
through whom we will win.

What have the older people done? We do not see their sports. They too,  have
talents that they can utilise. Perhaps even high  blood  pressure,  diabetes
and heart diseases could improve. [Interjections.]

I would like to ask the Minister to give the older people who  have  talents
in sports the opportunity to exercise their bodies. This is healthy.  I,  as
a member of the public who was a nurse for many years, feel bad when I  hear
that a soccer player who was once popular can no  longer  play  because  his
age prevents him from doing this. If his age prevents him, what must he  do,
because he loves soccer? Where is a team of his age group that he can join?

If a talented boxer needs to retire, what he must do  afterwards?  Where  is
the team that he can join and continue  to  use  his  talent?  One  ends  up
opening a business, then the high blood pressure starts, as  well  as  other
illnesses, because he does not exercise  his  body.  When  he  goes  to  the
doctor, he tells him that he needs to exercise  his  body  or  just  go  for
walks.]

This  is  a  challenge  to  the  Minister  and  his  department.  Sport  and
recreation must be made available to people of all ages to avoid stress  and
all other diseases caused by lack of exercise.  With  these  few  words  and
despite all the concerns I have highlighted, the  IFP  supports  the  Budget
Vote. [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, hon Minister of Sports and  Recreation,  hon  MECs
present here and hon members of the NCOP, firstly I would like to  apologise
on behalf of my MEC  who  could  not  make  it  to  this  House  because  of
unforeseen circumstances. Allow me to start by  partly  qualifying  in  this
House that in this Government we are looking for substance  in  whatever  we
do. We are looking for capability or capabilities and  we  are  looking  for
skills.

This Government checks to see  whether  a  person,  or  an  area,  is  in  a
position to be trained. If that person or that area is, then training  takes
place. In this way I wish to say that the Government is blind to  any  skill
colour. To those who still cling to the traditional  or  apartheid  ideology
in which people used to say that the colour of their skin  was  their  badge
of security in South Africa, this Government wants to say that it  does  not
have any room for that.

``My graad is my vel of my vel is my graad. Ons  het  nie  plek  vir  so  'n
houding in hierdie Regering nie.'' [My degree is my skin or my  skin  is  my
degree. We do not have room for such an attitude in this Government.]

The fact that this century has been declared the period of  human  existence
in which we reclaim the African cultural  heritage,  poses  a  challenge  of
rare proportions. This challenge  can  be  overcome  with  ease  if  we,  as
gathered in this august House, regard ourselves as  agents  of  the  African
Rennaisance on a march to deliver a successful  conclusion  to  the  African
century in the year 2100.

We are also grateful to note that with regard to the indigenous  games,  the
Minister of Sport and Recreation has played a vital role. I would  therefore
take this opportunity to thank the South African Sports Commission  for  the
four-day workshop held in April  2001  that  empowered  the  provincial  co-
ordinators in the seven games identified, the seven indigenous games.

[Hon Chairperson, it is very good to know that today our children  know  how
to play traditional games like the stone game, double dutch,  draughts,  the
stone game for men, square and touch games. I do not doubt that these  games
will produce better results amongst our people in the Limpopo province.

Firstly, our people will  be  able  to  play  games  of  their  own  choice.
Secondly,  they  will  be  able  to  enter  into  new  country,  which  will
eventually enable them to reach for the Olympic Games. In order  to  support
these games, the Government is  requested  to  increase  the  allocation  of
money in order to be able to obtain equipment and comply with other needs.

In the Limpopo province, we join hands with  the  private  sector.  This  is
very necessary. We are supported by three radio  stations,  namely  Manghana
Lonene, Phalaphala and Thobela FM that helped  us  to  establish  indigenous
games in our region, and this coincided with Heritage Day  during  September
2001. These games are played by the  people  and  the  local  government  is
responsible  for  the  guidance  and  management  of  these   games.   These
committees were empowered by way of  establishing  workshops  on  indigenous
games. These efforts help to develop indigenous games instead of  neglecting
them, with nobody to look after these games.

We want to thank the South African Sports Commission for the equipment,  and
for providing in other needs  of  the  Limpopo  province.  We  again  humbly
request an additional supply of equipment. At the beginning of the  year  we
had the regional sports competition of indigenous games, which were held  at
the Klaserie Dam. In February  this  year  we  entered  the  draughts  world
championship competition, where four competitors from Limpopo province  were
awarded silver medals. Competitors  from  countries  like  Germany,  Taiwan,
Botswana, Swaziland and others took part in the competition.]

When opening the sitting of the provincial legislature  this  year,  Premier
Ngoako Ramatlhodi said the  following  in  reference  to  education,  and  I
quote:


  Quality education requires a chain of actions involving the entire  civil
  society. If any link in this chain is  broken  the  entire  system  finds
  itself in jeopardy.

This statement makes us define the role of sport in  enhancing  the  quality
of education of our children and in dealing with  other  broader  challenges
faced by society. It is in that context that there is agreement that  school
sports is an  important  tool  which  has  to  contribute  towards  holistic
development of the child.

We have the duty and responsibility to make sure  that  the  environment  in
schools assists in developing healthy lifestyles,  productivity,  peace  and
democratic practices throughout society. The  funding  of  school  sport  is
very important, since  it  is  the  foundation  on  which  professional  and
amateur sport rest.

It is very clear that if school and college sports  are  not  receiving  the
attention they should be receiving, sport in this  country  will  not  reach
its full potential.

[There are problems. We are confronted with problems. The first  problem  is
that most schools, especially in rural areas, do not  have  facilities.  The
second problem is the scarcity of money. The third problem  is  that  we  do
not know whose responsibility sports is. Does it fall under  the  Department
of Education or the Development of Sports and Recreation?
We have good news. The Limpopo Sports Association received R20,430 from  the
Lotto. This money will be utilised to strengthen these games  so  that  they
could develop. There are famous  sportsmen  in  the  Limpopo  province  like
Mbulaheni Mulaudzi, who is an 800 metres champion and  he  holds  the  South
African record.

In soccer we have Harris Choeu, who is a deputy coach  of  Orlando  Pirates.
Trott Moloto is a deputy coach who assists  Jomo  Sono  in  training  Bafana

Ria Stars and Black Leopards clubs have reached the Premier  League  and  we
are still expecting Dynamos to join the Premier League too.  In  boxing  ...

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, if the hon Raju would look ... could the hon  Raju
please listen. If he would look at his party and thereafter  at  himself  in
the mirror, he would realise that he is a square peg  in  a  round  hole  in
that party. [Laughter.]

Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  MECs  here  present,  special  delegates  and
permanent  delegates,  the  pace  of  transformation  and   the   impatience
resulting from unmet expectations constitute a challenge that  the  Ministry
of Sports and Recreation in South Africa encounters on a daily basis.

It is common knowledge that there are some amongst us, like  the  hon  Raju,
who have gone to great  lengths  to  ensure  that  a  distorted  picture  is
created  in  the  minds  of  South  Africans  about   what   is   meant   by
transformation.

For  us,  transformation  is   underpinned   by   democracy,   nonracialism,
nonsexism, equity and access, redress, representativity and  accountability.
And we must hasten to say  here  that  without  positive  discrimination  in
favour of blacks, transformation will remain a mirage in this country.

By positive discrimination in favour of blacks, we mean that  if  there  are
two people, one white and the other black, both of whom are equally able  to
fill a certain position in sports, one must  consciously  forget  about  the
white person and take the black person, put him forward to be able  to  fill
the position. That is positive discrimination.

Because transformation  and  representativity  are  inextricably  linked  to
Government's policy to create a better life for all, sport cannot -  and  as
some of would like to have it - be outside the national agenda.

Sport  does  not  operate  in  isolation,  nor  is  it  independent  of  the
transformation agenda of which the ANC-led  Government  is  the  pioneer  in
this country. In the same way in which every  sphere  of  our  socioeconomic
and political lives are evolving from  a  past  steeped  in  discrimination,
sports is expected to do likewise. The Budget Vote before us today is  meant
to ensure exactly that.

The Sport and Recreation department of South Africa has embarked on a three-
year  programme  of  facility  provision  through  its  building  of  sports
programmes and recreation  projects.  The  projects  are  another  phase  in
Government's determination to deliver in  areas  where  the  needs  are  the
greatest in order to correct the imbalances of the past.

It demonstrates the commitment of  Sport  and  Recreation  South  Africa  to
pushing back the frontiers of poverty and expanding access to a better  life
for all.

Besides the fact that this programme will go a long way  towards  addressing
the sports facilities backlog in the disadvantaged areas, it is  also  aimed
at creating temporary and permanent jobs, resulting  in  income  generation,
and thus providing poverty relief. As the Minister  has  indicated  earlier,
to date 55 projects have been identified  and  created,  in  line  with  the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development  Strategy  and  the  Urban  Renewal
Programme, especially in the nodal points. In all projects, the  aim  is  to
employ local labour, with a bias towards women, youth and the  disabled.  We
want to commend the department for that.

At present,  Sport  and  Recreation  South  Africa  is  in  the  process  of
developing a sport and recreation policy that will ensure  access  to  sport
and recreation, and equity in  the  participation  of  the  youth,  disabled
persons and women. It goes  without  saying,  therefore,  that  to  us  this
aspect is of major concern.  These  groups,  especially  the  black  African
groups, are still  not  being  given  access  and  adequate  opportunity  to
participate on level playing fields. In this respect, we want to  call  upon
MECs, all provincial departments and local governments  to  play  a  crucial
role in seeing to it that those who have hitherto been disadvantaged do  get
a chance. Moreover, it is important that all  national  federations  embrace
this very noble principle.

The development of policy on transformation is also overdue, and we  support
Sport and Recreation South Africa  for  their  commitment  in  this  regard.
Sport and Recreation  South  Africa  has  also  established  a  distribution
agency  for  Sport  and  Recreation,  as  part   of   its   broader   social
responsibility. The main focus of  this  agency  is  the  establishment  and
consolidation of thriving, sustainable,  mass-based  sports  and  recreation
structures and programmes, especially in the rural communities.

This will be achieved  through,  among  other  things,  presidential  sports
awards, training in  sports  and  recreation  leadership,  establishing  co-
ordinated partnerships with learning institutions,  government-to-government
exchange  programmes,  and  the  visible  increase  of  national  sport  and
recreation structures, activities and physical infrastructure.

The successes and victories of the Ministry and Sport and  Recreation  South
Africa on a very broad front are well documented, and  we  remain  convinced
that they  will  continue  to  champion  the  cause  of  the  poor  and  the
underprivileged through sports.

Sports and recreation play an immeasurable role in  removing  children  from
the streets. It keeps them engaged so that their minds  do  not  become  the
workshop of the devil, as the saying goes.  The  spin-offs  include  reduced
crime in communities, leading to stable communities  which  will  eventually
thrive economically. Sports also go a very long way in enhancing  patriotism
and national identity.

In conclusion, sports and  recreation  therefore,  directly  or  indirectly,
improve the quality of life of all South Africans. Finally, we want to  join
the Minister in wishing Bafana Bafana well in the upcoming Soccer World  Cup
in Japan and Korea. We want to say: a healthy mind in a healthy body  should
be our guiding principle as a country. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION:  Madam  Chair,  I  will  respond  very
quickly. I will not keep members waiting; we  have  been  here  for  a  long
time. My colleague here, Dullah, is panicking. I know, because he  also  has
to do some work here tonight.

Very quickly, I do thank all the members, special delegates,  and  MECs  who
have spoken in this budget debate today. Most of  the  contributions  really
are in line with what we are doing within the department, and  all  of  them
are giving us guidance and insight into what we should be doing.  To  answer
one by one is not going to help us. I like what  Tata  Kgware  said  at  the
beginning of the debate, as he finished his speech. He  said:  ``Let's  play
ball.'' Sometimes we forget that we have to play ball.

There were very, very good contributions, from across the board.  The  issue
of women in sport is very close to my heart. It is an issue we will  tackle.
We will make sure that we bring it to this august House, and report on it.

There are a number of other areas. With regard to school sport, the  Western
Cape is leading the pack at the moment with what  they  have  told  us,  and
they could serve as a model for other provinces. I hope, really, we will  be
able to follow them. We will watch very, very closely  what  came  from  the
Western Cape.

Regarding the issue from Gauteng on women in sport and netball, I know  that
the MEC holds that very close to his heart, and  it  is  something  that  we
need to look at.

There was the Free State's commitment to the White Paper, and  the  economic
viability of sport, and everything that has taken place there.  I  will  not
dwell on issues of transformation, because all of us tend to agree.  I  will
come back to that at some stage, but not now. We also need to  look  at  the
decline, as Joyce has put it, in the participation  of  women.  We  need  to
promote and market the role models that are there. Sometimes  we  blame  the
public broadcaster, but at the moment they are trying their best.  They  are
doing very well, I must say. There  is  a  programme  that  comes  on  every
Saturday morning, Sesifikile, about  women  and  netball.  It  is  a  lovely
programme that they put on. They look at the national  netball  competitions
in our country and they profile the players, the participants, very well.

The issue of vandalism is an issue that all of us should  take  care  of  in
our communities, talk to communities about vandalism  of  these  facilities,
instead of the maximum utilisation of those  facilities.  We  should  always
look at that. In the same breath I want to say  that  I  have  spoken  about
resistance  to  transformation  coming  mainly  from  clubs  and  provincial
structures, from coaches who do not want to play  ball,  Ntate  Kgware,  who
would give any excuse to exclude players. Some of the  presidents  of  these
structures would give any excuse  to  exclude  people  from  the  management
administration. We need to look at that.

Somebody touched on boxing. We did eventually, last Saturday, come  up  with
associations that give effect to the new Boxing Act, and I was  quite  happy
with the participation that we had, thanks to Gauteng.  We  had  it  in  the
Civic Centre in Gauteng. We were  given  that  by  the  Gauteng  department,
which was very good. I must mention also - when Dullah came in  I  smiled  -
we got through the Cup of  Nations  three  Ministers  of  our  Government  -
Foreign Affairs, Sport and Recreation, and Transport. We were  awarded  with
the highest honours by the Mali government for assisting Mali with  the  Cup
of Nations. [Applause.]
It is something that we are very proud of because that is also giving  flesh
to Nepad. We do not  simply  talk  about  the  African  Renaissance  in  the
abstract. We try our best. I would like to dedicate  my  award  to  all  the
companies, starting with Johnny Dladla, who took up the cudgels for that  to
all the teams that he worked with and to all  the  South  African  companies
that contributed to making that competition  a  success.  That  one  is  for
them.

Very quickly, I am just finishing off. Yes,  in  tennis  there  are  up-and-
coming youngsters. It does worry us quite a lot  but  there  are  youngsters
that are coming up: Raven Klaasen, P J Nomdo and others. But we  still  need
to do a lot to assist tennis, to make it work.

Lastly, with regard to old or  mature  citizens  of  our  country,  the  hon
Vilakazi was quite correct. She was very correct. I wish she could  actually
start here with  Parliament.  We  parliamentarians  could  come  in  in  the
morning and all of us could start walking from right down the bottom end  of
Adderley Street right up to here and back again.  That  would  give  a  good
message to the whole country that it is not about us only giving  orders  to
the  old  and  mature  citizens  of  our  country,  but  about  all  of   us
participating, with everybody - including Enver  and  Dullah  -  in  shorts.
[Laughter.] Yes. It would be recreational for all of  us  to  do  that,  and
maybe on the route up here, we could do some skipping as we go. Dullah  must
bring along his dog.

On the way up here or back, we could  actually  be  convincing  Mr  Raju  by
talking to him. It is amazing. I met Mr Raju some time ago and  he  said  to
me that he was involved in nonracial sports. [Interjections.]  I  am  coming
to that. He said that he felt very bad about a  number  of  people  who  had
been treated very badly in this  country  during  the  apartheid  years.  He
knows the  history  very  well,  make  no  mistake.  He  spoke  about  Papwa
Sewgolum, the  golfer  who  was  given  whatever  in  the  rain  in  Durban.
[Interjections.] But unfortunately, I did not think that there  would  be  a
day when I would say this to Mr Raju - I am  not  sure  -  but  the  way  he
thinks is exactly the way Clive Rice does. It is amazing that he  can  think
the same way as Clive Rice.

It is a real pity that he thinks that way. But also at some stage,  when  he
looks in the mirror, he should tell himself that he is  Mr  Raju  and  knows
the history of sport in this country, and that he cannot be  told  something
by a party that does not know a damn thing and come  and  say  it  here.  He
does not believe it himself, but  he  is  saying  the  things  he  does  not
believe. He is just repeating what they are telling him to repeat.  I  would
like to tell the hon Mr Raju that what he is saying is wrong, because he  is
misleading a lot of people out there. He must tell his party  that  he  does
not agree with them, because they are wrong. He must tell them that he  does
not agree with them.

Unfortunately they will kick him out. [Laughter.]  But  at  least  he  would
have been kicked out with pride and dignity. It is really  a  pity  that  he
thinks that way. But we  have  addressed  some  of  these  things.  The  hon
member, in his party caucus, must please say that, as the hon  member  Raju,
knowing the history of black people in this country, he is not going  to  be
a party to this thing. He must not sell his soul, knowing what is wrong.

I am not going to go into  this  thing  of  transition  and  transformation,
because there are two distinct things here. The performance of our teams  is
not about transformation. Yes, part of it is. National teams  all  over  the
world go through peaks and troughs. They do. Anyone can read about it  as  a
student of sport. For the first time, the West Indies  are  coming  back  to
being the old West Indies team that we knew it to be - for the  first  time.
New Zealand and Australia went  through  that.  When  it  happens  in  South
Africa people talk about mediocrity and all that kind of nonsense.

There are players who are performing better  now,  at  the  present  moment.
Gcobani Bobo is injured, but I will never forget the sight of Gcobani  Bobo,
a black young star, coming  from  the  rural  areas  of  the  Eastern  Cape,
running across the whole of  Loftus  Versfeld.  This  has  never  been  done
before by any black, but he  did  it.  He  was  not  there  because  he  was
mediocre. He was there because he was damn good!  He  is  damn  good!  Bolla
Conradie is the best scrum half in the country.  He  is  not  there  because
Balfour pushed him there; he is there because he  is  bloody  good!  End  of
story! He is bloody good! Ashwell Prince got  selected  from  Potchefstroom,
was put in the team and batted the Australians out.  Let  us  be  honest  in
whatever we say.

There are two things -  transformation  and  transition.  Teams  go  through
that. To stand there and talk  about  pushing  teams  into  selecting  black
players! We will do it because we believe that these players are damn  good!
End of story, non-negotiable. Those who want to leave can jump,  scream  and
lie across the railway line. Let the train  cross  and  then  we  will  bury
them. Those who want to leave can leave. We have the players to do the job.

I wish Mr Raju a good night. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                   NATIONAL RAILWAY SAFETY REGULATOR BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, permanent  delegates,  delegates  to
the NCOP, friends and comrades, I rise to  introduce  the  National  Railway
Safety Regulator  Bill.  This  Bill  has,  as  its  central  objective,  the
promotion of safe railway operations in  South  Africa.  Through  this  Bill
South Africa seeks  to  bring  itself  into  line  with  best  international
practice in the provision of safety and security in railway operations.

Government is committed to improving safety and security  across  the  whole
transport sector, including railway stations, trains and  operations.  Today
we are focusing on railway operations in the main,  but  we  do  so  in  the
greater context of the need for  safety  and  security  across  the  system.
``Security'' is defined in the Bill as ``freedom from  intentional  harm  or
damage to persons or property''. ``Safety'' is  defined  as  ``the  lack  of
railway  occurrences,  fatalities,  injuries  or   damage   within   railway
operations''. The major focus of the Bill  is  on  safety  as  defined.  The
issue of security, however, is also receiving focused attention.

The Bill before this House is the product of wide  consultation  and  study.
We have been fortunate in having the  support  of  the  Canadian  government
provided in terms of a  co-operation  agreement  we  have  with  them.  With
Canadian assistance we set up a team which looked  at  how  other  countries
promote safety in rail operations. We have tried to extract  best  practice.
Our team visited Canada, and Canadian experts in  turn  worked  with  us  in
South Africa. We settled on the Canadian model as a benchmark in  developing
our legislation, but we have customised the Bill to meet the  needs  of  our
country. We can safely say that the safety management  system  envisaged  in
the Bill will be in line with best international practice.

Through this piece of legislation and its implementation, we will move  away
from a system which has been with us ever since  the  first  rail  operation
commenced in South Africa about 150 years ago. For the duration of that  150
years and reflecting the current situation as well, the  operating  entities
were not  only  the  service  providers.  They  were  also  responsible  for
regulation,  setting  standards,  conducting   investigations   and   making
findings. The operator has been both referee and player at  the  same  time.
That institutional arrangement may have been adequate in the  past,  but  it
is clearly inadequate now.

Principles of good  governance  demand  that  we  separate  the  setting  of
standards, the monitoring of safety measures, investigations  and  oversight
functions generally from operations.

We are bringing about institutional reform to provide  greater  transparency
and independent  safety  regulation  and  governance.  No  longer  will  the
operator set its own standards, be solely  responsible  for  monitoring  its
compliance, conduct its own investigation, and be  the  arbiter  on  whether
there has been compliance or noncompliance.

Operators will continue to bear responsibility for developing  their  safety
management plans, but this  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  norms  and
guidelines that will be specified in regulations and  standards  which  will
be promulgated into law. The standards will not  be  set  by  the  operators
themselves, and whilst the operator will no  doubt  be  required  to  ensure
constant monitoring of compliance, it is the regulator  which  will  oversee
safety and will enjoy considerable powers to enforce compliance.

I am fully aware  of  the  fact  that  the  passing  of  this  law  and  the
establishment of the office of the Railway Safety  Regulator  on  their  own
will not be enough to secure safe railway operations.  We  need  to  upgrade
our infrastucture, railway stations, rolling  stock,  the  perways  and  our
signalling systems. Moreover, train drivers  and  other  personnel  must  be
properly  trained,  so  that  they  are  able  to  render   high-class   and
responsible service, conscious of the fact that they  hold  in  their  hands
the lives of countless men, women and children.

They must be motivated, alert and fit at all times. Nothing  less  will  do.
Therefore, Government and employer have the added responsibility to  ensure,
in co-operation with employees and their trade unions, that  working  hours,
remuneration and conditions of service will facilitate  and  keep  in  place
the skilled and motivated workforce needed to  promote  maximum  safety  and
security.

In addition we need to reach out  to  the  commuting  public  to  win  their
confidence, support and co-operation. We need their support to  protect  our
system against vandalism, theft and damage. Our commuting  public  needs  to
feel that the railway system belongs to them  and  that  Government  is  the
trustee and caretaker acting on their behalf.

The  system  of   co-operation,   consultation   and   interaction   between
Government, operators and commuter fora must  be  encouraged  and  extended.
There is much work to do on all  of  these  fronts.  I  am  aware  that  the
passing  of  this  legislation  is  not  enough.  But  it  is  an  essential
prerequisite. This is so because the current  institutional  arrangement  is
outdated and flawed.

Indeed, as the first ever democratic government to come  into  office  after
our first democratic elections, we prioritised the issue of  safety  in  the
different transport modes. We effected institutional reform to bring  us  in
line with best international practice. We passed legislation  and  took  all
the practical steps necessary to create arms-length  institutions  operating
at arms length from Government.

Hence one now has the SA  Civil  Aviation  Authority  and  the  SA  Maritime
Safety Authority. Whilst there is  always  room  for  improvement,  the  new
arrangement has been a big success. Aviation safety  is  very  much  in  the
news. We have on two occasions during  the  past  few  years  subjected  our
civil aviation authority to  audits  by  the  International  Civil  Aviation
Organisation.

Our system is  generally  in  compliance  with  international  requirements,
though we strive to improve all the time. In the case  of  the  SA  Maritime
Safety  Authority,  compliance  with  standards  set  by  the  International
Maritime Organisation is top priority. A number of steps have been taken  to
promote safety at sea, and some others are still in the pipeline.

The general principle which we have applied is that we must separate policy-
making and regulation from actual operations.  The  reform  with  regard  to
railway operations is part of the general vision  of  Government  to  ensure
that we are in line with international best practice.

In terms of the National Railway Safety Regulator Bill, operational  railway
safety will now be managed within  the  framework  of  a  safety  management
system. The final authority and guardian  of  railway  safety  will  be  the
national Railway Safety Regulator. In terms of the system, no  one  will  be
allowed to conduct railway operations without a safety  permit.  The  safety
permit can only be issued by the national Railway Safety  Regulator.  Before
such a permit can be issued, the operator must submit  to  the  regulator  a
proper application.

Details of requirements will  be  promulgated  in  regulations.  Regulations
promulgated in the Government Gazette  will  also  prescribe  the  standards
with which operators must comply. An operator will  be  required  to  submit
his or her detailed safety plan, focusing  on  geographical  considerations,
transport of dangerous goods, transport of other commodities,  transport  of
passengers,  transport  of  general  freight,  speed-related  and  traction-
related issues and provision for safety inspections.

The regulator will judge  the  safety  plan  of  the  operator  against  the
standards prescribed in the regulations. The regulator may  reject  a  plan,
may require amendments or additions, but will only  approve  an  application
for a safety permit if all the requirements for safety  have  been  complied
with. The regulator will also have the power to suspend or revoke  a  safety
permit. No operator will be allowed to conduct  operations  where  a  safety
permit has been suspended or  revoked.  In  other  words,  no  operator  can
operate without a safety permit.

I draw special attention to the provisions of Chapter 4 and 5 of  the  Bill.
Chapter 4 deals with railway undertakings requiring  a  safety  permit,  the
form of applications, the conditions of a safety permit and also  authorises
the suspension, revocation and surrender of  a  safety  permit.  The  safety
permit may not be transferred according to the provisions.

Chapter  5  makes  provision  for  safety  management  systems  and   safety
management system reports. It requires the Minister to make  regulations  on
procedure and for the board of the  regulator  to  lay  down  standards.  It
covers provision for regulation regarding  design,  construction,  operation
and  alteration  of  rolling  stock,  infrastructure  and   stations,   also
nonrailway operations affecting safety.

The Bill provides for wide powers  of  entry  and  inspection  and  a  legal
requirement to assist railway safety inspectors. These inspectors will  also
have the power to issue directives on how to deal with unsafe conditions.

Another new feature  in  the  South  African  railway  system  will  be  the
requirement that all railway occurrences must be reported to the  regulator,
who will have the power  and,  in  some  situations,  the  duty  to  conduct
investigations. In effect, the Bill makes  provision  for  coresponsibility.
The functions and responsibilities of the regulator as overseer, the  setter
of  standards,  the  issuer  of  safety  permits,  the  arbiter  in  alleged
violations or noncompliance, the responsible body for monitoring  compliance
with safety plans are clearly defined.

On the other hand, an operator must comply with its safety  plans,  or  face
cancellation of its safety permit. It is responsible  for  safe  operations,
and if it fails, it will pay the price.  Clause  45  of  the  Bill  lists  a
number of offences, and provides for penalties ranging from 5 to  15  years'
imprisonment, alternatively to a fine or both a fine and imprisonment.

What is more, in the same enquiry an award or compensation  for  harm,  loss
or damage suffered as a result  of  an  act  or  omission  constituting  the
offence, may be made by the court.  This  will  save  victims  the  need  to
institute legal proceedings in court with all its  inconvenience,  cost  and
delay - though the right to seek redress in court will always be respected.

We believe in the rule of law in all governance issues  and  hence  the  law
makes provision for appeals to the chief executive officer,  and  ultimately
the board. In terms of our Constitution and the law, all  decisions  can  be
subjected to review by South African courts.

In its totality the Bill will give  birth  to  a  safety  management  system
through which railway operational safety will be managed.  It  includes  the
safety of the public and personnel within the railway  industry,  protection
of property and environment, including design, as well as  commissioning  of
infrastructure and rolling stock.

This safety management system includes a regulatory framework  within  which
a uniform set of safety standards  is  to  be  developed  and  applied.  One
cannot have one set of rules for one operator and another set of  rules  for
another operator in the performance of similar  functions.  The  Bill  makes
provision for uniform standards.

We are on the eve of a new dawn in railway safety in South  Africa,  but  as
hon members can see, there is a great deal of work to be done. But there  is
clear direction and the marching orders are clear. There will be no  turning
back, because for us people come first and  the  safety  of  our  people  is
paramount.

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Deputy Chairperson, as the chairperson of this  committee
I will lead by example. It  is  not  compulsory  to  use  all  six  minutes.
[Laughter.] The Bill in front of us is long overdue, especially in  that  it
speaks of providing for safety standards  for  the  protection  of  persons,
property and environment. As the Bill intends to  provide  for  and  promote
safe railway operations, the responsibility and  accountability  of  railway
operators become its key objective.

The poor safety standards in passenger trains in our  country  have  been  a
concern for many years. Train accidents, poor service  standards  and  crime
at the stations and inside trains have made trains the least desirable  mode
of transport for many commuters. The problems of the rail  industry  can  be
attributed to the fact that at present there  is  no  regulation  specifying
norms and standards that should be followed by  the  rail  operators.  As  a
result rail operators set their own safety standards without an  independent
body playing an oversight role.

The introduction of the National Railway Safety Regulator Bill  brings  hope
for the transformation and rationalisation of South African rail  transport.
The history of transport in South Africa has been a  continual  increase  in
the use of road transport as the preferred  means  for  most  commuters.  In
order for us to achieve a sustainable transport system, there is a  need  to
improve rail  passenger  services  significantly.  Reliable  and  safe  rail
transport can make a positive contribution to the economy  by  reducing  the
demand for oil imports. Between 1 May 2000 and April 2002, there  were  four
reported accidents on trains.

Rail transport has a potential role to play in the development and  creation
of a sustainable transport system in South Africa as a whole, especially  in
the context of Nepad. An operator should not be a referee and  a  player  at
the same time.

The committee appreciates all the concerted efforts by the Minister,  Dullah
Omar, towards achieving safety in all modes of transport.  We  look  forward
to the urgent implementation of this Bill, and we  as  the  members  of  the
select committee are going to monitor the  implementation  and  ensure  that
all our passengers are safe. [Applause.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson and hon Minister, I am  reading  this  speech  on
behalf of the Gauteng province, so this is the Gauteng provincial input.  We
from Gauteng concur with the viewpoints expressed by the Minister.

The Gauteng province welcomes the introduction  of  this  Bill  before  this
honourable House, the National Council of  Provinces.  Our  province  cannot
wait for the  passing  of  this  important  piece  of  legislation,  as  its
introduction is long overdue. We want to believe that all  members  of  this
House by now are aware of the fact  that  Gauteng  is  one  of  the  leading
provinces in terms of train accidents that have occurred nationally.

Amongst all modes of public transport,  rail  is  the  most  affordable  and
accessible to the poorest  of  our  people.  As  a  result  it  becomes  our
responsibility as Government to ensure that we provide not  only  affordable
but also safe and efficient public transport. Therefore the issue of  safety
is not negotiable.

Gauteng, in considering this Bill, did  note  some  concerns  in  key  areas
which were submitted during the negotiating mandate.  Indeed,  most  of  our
concerns were addressed by the national Department of Transport. One of  our
most important concerns is around the representation of women on the  board.
We feel that there must be a  specific  clause  which  should  cover  gender
balance in the Bill. We are of the opinion that we cannot just leave  things
to chance and we must avoid ambiguity in the Bill. We therefore  appeal  for
serious consideration to be given to our recommendations.

We want to reiterate our position from Gauteng, that our  province  supports
the Bill, as we believe that it will go a long way in transforming the  rail
industry. We are grateful for the opportunity  to  add  our  voice  in  this
important debate. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Minister of Transport, hon special  delegates,
hon colleagues, my previous speech was grossly misunderstood, and  therefore
I intend to deliver this rather slowly. [Laughter.] I might seriously  think
of taking English classes.

The National Railway Safety Regulator Bill addresses  the  urgent  need  for
operational safety and its management, control and  supervision  within  the
South African railway system.

After a spate of  accidents  resulting  in  the  premature  deaths  of  many
commuters, including schoolchildren, it was disconcerting to  discover  that
no transport legislation existed to govern safety in the  railway  industry.
The Occupational Health and Safety Act deals with working conditions in  the
factory environment and I  think  there  are  other  pieces  of  legislation
existing in the health and environment sectors,  but  there  is  a  lack  of
legislation specifically for the safety of the public and  personnel  within
the rail industry and for the protection of property  and  the  environment.
The National Railway  Safety  Regulator  Bill  introduced  by  the  Minister
addresses this deficiency in transport legislation.

One of the concerns my province of KwaZulu-Natal had was in relation to  the
composition of the board, and accordingly  it  introduced  an  amendment  in
favour of provincial representation. This amendment was  strongly  supported
by both Mpumalanga  and  the  Eastern  Cape,  two  other  provinces  heavily
affected by railway  operations.  But  this  intervention  sought  by  these
provinces fell on deaf ears, the department  purveying  the  view  that  the
board was intended to be  run  on  business  lines  and  that  catering  for
provincial or parochial representation would make  the  board  unwieldy  and
affect proper administration of the regulatory system.

The DP calls for the  protection  and  security  of  passengers  using  rail
transport. The hon chairperson of the select  committee,  Ms  Majodina,  has
already referred to the kinds of crimes that take place and  the  fact  that
passengers have to be  victims  of  these  criminal  elements.  The  freedom
enjoyed by  the  criminal  elements  in  harassing  passengers  by  robbery,
assaults and even murders is  untenable  in  rail  transport  or  any  other
business. Only recently we  read  about  a  tragic  situation  affecting,  I
think, commuters on one of the Cape Metro lines, where  quite  a  few  young
commuters fell victim to thugs and some of them died.

The principle of co-operative government and intergovernmental relations  as
contemplated in Chapter 3 of the Constitution has  been  recognised  by  the
proposed legislation. The  Department  of  Safety  and  Security  playing  a
complementary and positive role becomes an important, integral part of  this
Bill.

My party  requests  that  the  former  railway  police  be  reactivated  and
introduced as a visible presence, not only as a deterrent to criminals,  but
also to apprehend those incorrigible miscreants who insist that  crime  pays
and thus provide safety and security to rail commuters.  My  party  supports
the Bill.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  member,
your go-slow has robbed you of your time. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr T MHLAHLO (Eastern Cape): Chairperson,  the  Eastern  Cape  welcomes  and
supports this Bill, especially because it is designed to address the  safety
operations of all persons  safeguard  and  the  environment  in  which  rail
service and public transport operate generally in our country.

It is important and remains a priority to  strengthen  safety  and  security
standards of our rail system and passenger rail service in general. As  this
Bill seeks to bring all state organs around railway operations and build co-
operative approach in provision of services, this will give  effect  to  the
principles of Chapter 3 of the Constitution. We believe  this  will  realise
co-operative governance.

In the recent past we have seen a number of incidents in our passenger  rail
service. Some of these must not repeat  themselves.  We  believe  this  Bill
will strengthen relations amongst stakeholders and passengers  will  have  a
platform to communicate through the regulator.

Commuters must not allow individuals to destroy state assets and we  believe
any individual who want to solve problems by means of  violence  should  not
be allowed within the railway system in this country.

We are convinced that the establishment  of  the  Railway  Safety  Regulator
with  a  board  of  directors  and  chief  executive  officer  will  further
strengthen the Bill and build confidence around railway programmes  in  this
country. We fully support the composition of the board as reflected  in  the
Bill.

The railway service must remain the safest mode of transportation  in  South
Africa, because it is the only means of transport for the  majority  of  our
people who are poor and who are without alternative.

The Ministry of Safety and Security  must  see  railways  as  one  important
sector,  as  defined  in  the  Bill,  and  strengthen  safety  and  security
measures, which are very  necessary  at  present.  The  negative  impact  of
failures of the past apartheid regime are most felt today in  this  country.
The failure to provide the  necessary  regulations  to  manage  our  railway
system affects the innocent and most are  suffering  as  commuters  in  this
country.

The poorest of our communities were moved away from  job  opportunities  and
amenities, and railway safety regulations were designed on a  racial  basis.
Affordable public transport as a social service was ignored. South  Africans
must be encouraged to use public transport.

We further support the objective of positioning our country in the  Southern
African region and become an international role-player. The  railway  system
will transport our African communities across boundaries.

The South African railway system needs to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the
African Renaissance and Nepad's intention to be able to move South  Africans
across Africa so that we can become participants in the development  of  our
region.

We want to convey to this honourable House our province's  position  and  we
are fully in support of this important Bill. We regard this as  one  of  the
important moves towards a better life in this country. [Applause.]

Mr P E PASHA  (Mpumalanga):  Chairperson,  what  more  can  I  say,  if  the
Minister, the Chairperson and the people  have  spoken.  [Interjections.]  I
come from  Mpumalanga  and  therefore  have  to  reflect  the  input  by  my
province.

The past few weeks have seen the province of Mpumalanga, like  many  others,
engaged  in   extensive   committee   discussions   and   interaction   with
stakeholders on one of the most important pieces of legislation  before  us.
Railway transportation is one of the key and most important modes of  public
transport in the country, used in the main by those of our people  who  stay
and commute between towns and townships, across the borders of South  Africa
and beyond. It is the voice of those commuters  who  are  workers,  mothers,
fathers and children that I represent here today.

Having been a commuter myself before and my experience of how  it  feels  to
be on a train for three days from the Free  State  to  Johannesburg,  always
preoccupied with one's safety and security, I must indicate  that  the  Bill
presented and debated today is a step in the right direction and is  a  Bill
that we have waited for. The ANC-led Government should be  congratulated  on
coming up with this piece of legislation and to the hon Minister I  wish  to
say: Sithi kungqongqoshe siyathokoza. [We would like to  tell  the  Minister
that we are happy.]

I have no doubt that despite matters of substance and  detail  we  all  have
raised in our mandates, we all welcome the mandate  as  it  relates  to  the
establishment  of  a  safety  regulator  -  something  unheard  of   before.
Notwithstanding both our negotiating and final mandates submitted, we  as  a
province wish to reiterate our submission on two areas as contained  in  the
Bill. Hopefully, the Ministry will consider them.

It is our view that provinces will, to  a  larger  extent,  be  required  to
implement the Act.  Nonrepresentation  of  provinces  will  have  particular
implications as it  relates  to  design  and  construction  of  new  railway
infrastructure. It is with this in mind that we make our appeal  once  again
and resubmit our proposal that the representation of provinces on the  board
of the regulator is a very important thing to be considered.

The second issue that we  want  to  raise  relates  to  the  powers  of  the
regulating authority. We will propose that instead of the  applications  for
permits being made to the CEO, this be done  to  the  board  directly.  This
would give greater legitimacy to the process. Here again, provincial  inputs
will be necessary. The intergovernmental, interdepartmental  and  integrated
approach  to  addressing  issues  of  occupational  health  and  safety  and
security in broad terms should  enhance  our  capability  of  creating  safe
railway operations.

Mpumalanga would like to see rail corridors strengthened, extended and  used
more optimally and safely. In particular there is an  urgent  need  for  the
province and the country to introduce safe  and  affordable  rail  services,
which process will be enhanced by the regulator.  Mpumalanga  is  supportive
of this progressive legislation and we once again say: A road to success  is
always under construction. It is a progressive course  and  not  an  end  in
itself. [Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, the MEC for Transport, Dr Farisani,  apologises
for being unable to  attend  this  debate  due  to  other  commitments.  The
chairperson of this committee also extends his apologies. A maxim  goes:  No
man shall be a judge of  himself.  The  argument  that  Metrorail  operators
cannot be both a player and a referee holds very strongly.

Now, the Bill's intention to establish a national Railway  Safety  Regulator
therefore becomes critical. The Minister indicated  in  May  2001  that  his
department would embark on a R400 million programme over a  period  of  five
years to improve commuter rail safety, especially in the metropoles.  A  few
months later, in the same year,  the  Minister  expressed  a  need  for  the
extension of the commuter rail network in order to  relieve  the  congestion
that usually occurs during peak hours. I raise this matter because the  Bill
that we are interrogating seems to kick start the process today.

The need for  the  services  of  the  Railway  Safety  Regulator  cannot  be
overemphasised. We sit with a situation in our  metropoles  where  Metrorail
transports almost two million people to and from work daily.  About  half  a
million stations are serviced  daily  by  about  2  500  trains,  let  alone
Metrorail  activities  that  take  place  outside  our  cities.  Given  this
background, it is crucial that the safety of these  commuters  be  protected
at all costs. It is therefore basically this intention which the  Bill  aims
to achieve.
Although I am not equipped with statistical  evidence,  Metrorail  transport
facilities are used by the  majority  of  the  underprivileged,  as  already
alluded to by my colleagues here. Most of the  elite  depend  on  privately-
owned transport.

The promotion of the use  of  rail  as  a  mode  of  transportation  through
improved  safety  performance  in  the  railway  transport   industry   will
undoubtedly benefit the majority of the historically disadvantaged. Part  of
these historically disadvantaged are four  million  long-distance  Metrorail
commuters located in the peripheral areas like, in the case of the  Northern
Province or Limpopo, Messina,  Tzaneen,  Louis  Trichardt,  Mara-Base,  etc.
Equity in terms of providing and managing railway  safety  measures  in  the
metropole is just as important as on mainline passenger trains,  since  they
link South Africa with SADC member countries such as Zimbabwe and others.

While Metrorail and mainline passenger fees are generally cheaper  and  more
affordable, and while it is a fact that there are fewer  accidents  compared
to road transport, travelling time has remained a  deterring  factor.  Taxis
and minibuses have turned out to be more service-friendly. It takes one  not
less than 14 hours to travel from Park Station  to  Tzaneen  by  train.  The
promotion of the use of rail as a mode of transportation has  to  take  into
account this factor.

The Standing Committee on Public Works, Transport  and  Housing  in  Limpopo
has carried out close scrutiny of this  Bill  and  has  made  the  following
observations. Firstly,  the  composition  of  the  board  should  take  into
account  representation  from  areas  outside  the  metropoles,  since   the
mainline passenger services extend to the peripheral areas of South  Africa.
Secondly, the committee appealed for co-operative governance with regard  to
the management of crime committed during travelling.

In conclusion, I would like to put on record that  the  Limpopo  legislature
supports this Bill without reservations. [Applause.]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, Minister, special delegates and  hon  members,  in
order to appreciate the impact of this Bill it is  important  to  understand
the background against which it arose. First of all, the railways  in  South
Africa perform both a social and an economic function.  The  railway  system
plays a major role in export trade, and in moving grain, coal  and  minerals
to ports; moves large volumes of freight between states in the SADC  region;
and, as an urban transit mode, plays a critical role in  providing  millions
of poor people with a cheap and accessible mode of transport  to  employment
and educational opportunities.  Because  of  these  important  economic  and
social functions, it is imperative that the rail transport system is safe.

Because of the time factor, I am just going to raise  two  corrections.  The
first one is the opportunism displayed by the two hon  members  who  decided
to smuggle some views, which were defeated in the committee  when  we  dealt
with this Bill. The first aspect is the issue that was  raised  by  the  hon
Raju and that we have dealt with. Opportunistically he decided  to  mobilise
the other provinces to support that view. We had agreed that the  provincial
aspects were covered in terms of some clauses. Of course, there is a  clause
that provides that the  Minister,  after  consulting  the  MECs,  will  make
regulations and so on.

Secondly, it is unfortunate that the other province decided  again  to  give
the representation to somebody who  conveniently  decided  to  raise  things
addressed  in  the  committee  by  saying,  for  instance,  that  issues  of
representativity would be addressed in the advert for  the  board.  Now,  we
have raised the issues of, for instance,  women,  disability,  rural  people
and so on. For all of us to start  addressing  these  things  in  this  Bill
would mean an overhaul of all the laws that we have in the country.

The Free State supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana), Order! Hon P  Dyonase!
I hope I am pronouncing your surname correctly.
Mr P P DYONASE (North West): Chairperson, that is  a  good  pronouncement  -
eNorth West bathi Dayonase. Chairperson,  hon  MEC,  special  delegates  and
permanent delegates, last year when the hon the Minister launched  the  Road
to Safety 2001-2005 programme in this country, we  experienced,  during  the
festive  season,  a  high  number  of  accidents.  In  the  North  West  our
interpretation was that these were the kicks of a  dying  horse.  Such  high
accident rates will become a thing of the past.

In the past months we have also experienced some accidents  in  the  railway
sector. Fortunately or unfortunately, we have not yet passed this  Bill.  In
the North West we are also saying  such  railway  accidents  will  become  a
thing of the past. When we scrutinised this Bill  in  the  North  West,  our
experience, in the North West,  was  that  road-rail  crossings  were  areas
where we had experienced a lot of problems. A practical example happened  in
Klerksdorp, where a taxi was hit by a goods train. Recently in Taung,  which
is a rural area, we saw a taxi hit by the Blue Train.
Chapter 5 clause 31(g) provides that the office  of  the  hon  Minister  may
make regulations pertaining to these road  level-crossings.  Our  appeal  is
that we see some boom gates in other areas where trains  cross.  Of  course,
warning lights are there, but even the best or good drivers ignore them.  We
are appealing to the Minister to put up these boom  gates  in  most  of  our
country, particularly in those areas already identified as problematic.

It is fortunate or unfortunate that because the North West is a rural  area,
the past regime felt that in the villages that kind  of  infrastructure  was
not needed. Although fewer accidents are happening,  we  are  talking  about
our country, not the province.

As the North  West  we  fully  support  this  Bill.  It  is  hoped,  as  our
chairperson has said, that we are going to monitor. But  we  must  not  only
monitor, we as members must also assist where possible. [Applause.]

Mr C M DUGMORE (Western Cape): Chairperson,  Minister,  I  must  admit  that
listening to the first debate on sport helped me to describe how I  feel.  I
feel like a reserve today. Minister Essop is ill,  the  chairperson  of  the
committee, that is Mr Rhoda, also happens to be ill, and  our  deputy  chair
is not available. So I am probably the  C  team,  but  it  definitely  is  a
privilege for me to bring to this House some of the views from our  province
in regard to this particular Bill.

Fortunately I was part  of  the  discussions  on  26  April,  at  which  our
standing committee looked at the  Bill,  and  I  would  like  to  make  some
comments on behalf of the Western Cape. The first thing to say is  that  the
Western Cape fully supports the Bill that is before the NCOP. I  speak  here
with a mandate from the Western Cape, because we have a very clear  interest
as a province in the success of this regulator. Its success in every  corner
of our country, in fact, is going to require that all  of  our  provinces  -
and that is the commitment that we as the Western Cape make - have  to  play
their part in ensuring that the regulator succeeds  and  there  must  be  no
doubt about that.

The preamble, in fact, talks about a very important aspect and  that  is  to
encourage the collaboration and participation  of  interested  and  affected
parties. From the Western Cape we definitely see our  provincial  government
and the  Department  of  Transport,  specifically,  as  very  much  such  an
interested party. As a province, we are therefore  absolutely  committed  to
collaboration and participation.

It also gives me great pleasure to say that when I stand  here  representing
the Western Cape, we, in fact, represent a Government that speaks on  behalf
of over 80% of the people of this province, which was not  the  situation  a
year ago. [Interjections.] It is unfortunate  that  the  representatives  of
the DP, including the colleague who recently left the Chamber, are not  here
to hear that, because we have a responsibility not only to the  80%  of  the
people who were voted into Government, but in fact to the 20%  who  are  not
in the House today. That is the  responsibility  which  the  new  provincial
government accepts in regard to the Western Cape. [Interjections.]

Also,  I  would  like  to  refer  to  Chapter  2,  clause  2(b)  which  very
specifically talks about another  very  important  issue,  and  that  is  to
encourage  collaboration  and  participation  of  interested  and   affected
parties. Clause 6(2) in Chapter 3 also refers to  the  issue  of  a  written
agreement with organs  of  state.  What  we  would  like  to  bring  to  the
Minister's attention, specifically, is that clearly we regard  an  organ  of
state as also  being  provincial  government  and,  in  fact,  a  provincial
department of transport.

We want to ask that the Minister consider encouraging the regulator  to,  in
fact, enter into  a  written  co-operation  agreement  with  the  provincial
government itself. I think if that is  done  -  if  the  regulator  actually
enters into such written co-operation agreements with the  provinces  -  the
concerns of some of the provinces in regard to representation on  the  board
of the regulator itself could be taken  into  account.  We  would  urge  the
Minister  to  give  serious  consideration  to  this  written   co-operation
agreement with our provincial department of transport and others.

The briefing from the Minister's department also clarifies for  our  members
that the mandate of the Bill looks  specifically  at  safety  in  regard  to
employees and the rail operations themselves, and does not necessarily  look
directly at the safeguarding of passengers from  criminal  action.  This  is
going to require the  co-operation  of  community  safety  and  other  role-
players.

I also want to bring to the attention of the NCOP  on  the  point  that  our
provincial MEC, MEC Essop, has in fact earmarked R2 million as seed  funding
for the appointment of public transport safety  officers.  These  particular
safety officers will be a visible presence, not only on trains, but also  on
buses and taxi ranks to provide assistance and a service to communities.

So I do not think any  of  us  should  be  under  the  impression  that  the
regulator itself is going to be able to  solve  all  the  problems.  We  are
going to have to work together. We need  to  take  note  of  the  fact  that
without our people,  without  our  organised  communities  and  without  the
leadership supporting the regulator, we will  not  be  able  to  expect  and
demand that the regulator itself stamp out some of the conduct that we  have
seen recently. It is going to be up to  us  as  public  representatives,  as
MPs, as MPOs and as councillors to really get out  there  and  mobilise  our
communities to actually own and  take  ownership  of  the  property  of  our
democratic Government.

We need an active campaign in every corner of our  country,  and  commuters,
in particular those who live alongside the facilities, need to be  empowered
to take ownership of the property which we,  in  fact,  own.  Unless  we  do
this,  and  make  sure  that  the  commuter   organisations   are   properly
representative of the rural and urban  communities  that  actually  use  our
public transport, we will not achieve what we want to.
We do not need a situation in which some politicians once  a  year  ask  the
press to follow them on a train, and that is the end of it. We  need  follow
the example of our Minister of  Transport,  Minister  Dullah  Omar,  who  is
constantly seized of the need for safety. We  do  not  need  ``a  letter  to
Parliament'' or ``a post box to Parliament'' campaign in  which  people  are
just called on to write a letter. We  need  the  active  engagement  of  our
leadership supporting our Minister to achieve this.

Ixesha lifikile lokuba thina siqale ukugcina  izinto  zikaRhulumente  wethu.
[Uwele-wele.] [Kwaqhwatywa.] [The time has come  for  us  to  start  looking
after the property of our Government. [Interjections.] [Applause.]]

Die tyd het nou aangebreek  dat  ons  moet  besef  ons  moet  saam  met  die
reguleerder verantwoordelikheid neem vir die geboue en  die  spoorlyne.  Ons
kan nie verwag dat hulle alleen verantwoordelik moet  wees  nie.  [Applous.]
[The time has now come for us to realise that we should take  responsibility
for the buildings and railway tracks along with  the  regulator.  We  cannot
expect them alone to be responsible. [Applause.]]

Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, rail operators have been responsible for  setting
safety standards, and  for  monitoring  and  investigating  accidents.  This
means that up to now the operator was the player as well as the referee.

There are enormous challenges facing South African rail passenger  transport
before it can become a safe, reliable and efficient mode  of  transport  for
commuters.  This  Bill  brings  hope  as  it   makes   provision   for   the
establishment of a railway safety regulator, with its main  objective  being
to promote and oversee safety and security in the railway industry.

Not only will improving  the  safety,  reliability,  quality  and  speed  of
transporting goods and people benefit the thousands  of  commuters  who  use
rail transport daily, but a basic requirement of  improving  South  Africa's
competitiveness in the global economy will also  be  met.  It  is  therefore
imperative that the establishment of an independent railway regulator  takes
place as soon as possible.

The promotion of safe railway operations is  not  only  fundamental  to  the
safety of passengers, but also to all the people working for  the  operators
and to the environment. As a medical doctor I am very pleased that the  Bill
makes provision  for  the  regulator  to  play  a  very  important  role  in
supporting occupational health and  safety  for  its  staff  members,  whose
responsibility it is to keep the wheels of the economy  rolling.  It  is  of
the utmost importance that the environment and the workplaces  of  employees
are safe so as to ensure a healthy  workforce,  which  is  so  necessary  to
obtain and sustain safety operations.

Vandalism is causing the swift deterioration of the fixed and rolling  stock
of passenger rail operators, which stock will have to be replaced to  ensure
safety. According to the SA Rail Commuter Corporation, property worth  about
R50 million has been vandalised over the past two years.
There is also a need for additional infrastructure,  and  if  one  bears  in
mind that the backlog in the maintenance of South  Africa's  railway  system
is approximately R22 billion, one can only hope  that  the  Government  will
find the money to provide  sufficient  funds  to  give  the  department  the
capacity to implement this piece of legislation.

I appeal to the Minister of Finance to make enough money  available  to  the
Department of Transport for this purpose. The  New  NP  supports  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  the  National
Railway Safety Regulator Bill flows directly from  the  obligations  imposed
by the National Land Transport Transition Act on the  different  spheres  of
government to place greater emphasis and focus on the rights  of  the  users
of South Africa's public transport system, including  our  national  railway
system.

This Bill  is  the  culmination  of  a  long  process  of  consultation  and
discussion between our country's main railway  operators  and  the  national
Department of Transport over the issue of rail safety.

Mphathisihlalo,   mhlawumbe   kubalulekile   ukuthi   sichaze   ukuthi    lo
mThethosivivinywa   awukhulumi   ngezitimela   kepha    ukhuluma    ngabantu
abazigibelayo.

Njengoba sazi ukuthi akulula ukuthi umuntu alimaze isitimela, kodwa  kuyinto
elula ukuthi  isitimela  silimaze  umuntu.  Sesiye  sibone  nje  manje  kuba
yizitimela ezigibela abantu. Ngiyabona ukuthi kuye  kube  yiphuthana  lokho.
(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, perhaps it is important to  explain  that  this  Bill  is  not
about trains, but about commuters.

As we know, it is not easy for one to injure a train, but it is easy  for  a
train to injure a person. Now we see trains hitting people and I think  that
is wrong.]

The Bill covers all  aspects  of  railway  safety  and  is  not  limited  to
Spoornet and Metrorail.  It  includes  all  other  rail  entities,  such  as
Heritage railway steam clubs, surface railway lines in our  mining  industry
and railway traffic  crossing  our  borders  from  other  countries  in  the
region.

Abafowethu  laba  o-Metrorail  no-Spoornet,  kuyabonakala   njengoba   bonke
asebekhulumile  besho,  ukuthi  babukeka  bengabadlali  kanti  babuye  futhi
babengonompempe, yingakho  mhlawumbe  singasho  ukuthi  babukeka  bengabantu
abathwele nzima kakhulu. Lo mThethosivivinywa-ke ophambi  kwethu  uzobethula
umthwalo ukuze umsebenzi wabo ube lula. [These brothers of  ours,  Metrorail
and Spoornet, are  clearly  players  and  referees  at  the  same  time,  as
previous speakers have said. That is why we can say  that  it  looks  as  if
they are heavily burdened. The Bill that is in front of us will lessen  that
burden so that the work will be easier.]

The way the Bill works is that individual rail  entities  must  have  safety
standards in force to manage the  risks  of  any  activities  undertaken  by
them. The role of the safety regulator is to assess the  adequacy  of  those
controls and standards and to monitor their  effective  implementation.  The
means by which that is done is to require the rail entities to  satisfy  the
regulator that they have systems and standards in  place,  and  approved  by
the regulator, which will ensure that safety will be properly managed.

The regulator can ask each rail entity to prepare a  safety  plan  and  then
receive the safety plan. It will then make  sure  that  there  are  no  gaps
which would compromise the safety of railway users. Once the  regulator  has
received and approved the plans, it will ensure that  the  plan  is  carried
out.

If, for example, there are elements  of  a  safety  plan  that  need  to  be
introduced in the following year, the regulator can go  to  that  particular
entity and say to  that  entity  that  it  agreed  to  improve  its  braking
systems, or to improve signals or whatever the  particular  issue  was.  The
regulator can then make absolutely sure that this was happening.
Ngamanye  amazwi  i-regulator  le  izosebenza  njengonogada  kuwo  wonke  lo
mcimbi. [In other words, the regulator will operate as  a  security  measure
in this regard.]

All this will be achieved through co-operation between the safety  regulator
and the rail entities, and by communication between them.

A very important aspect of this Bill is the fact that it  looks  at  railway
safety in a holistic way. In other words, it does not  limit  itself  simply
to safety on the steel roads, but will be  proactively  engaged  in  setting
standards for all other aspects of railway operations which  may  impact  on
safety in the system.

Whilst I believe that there  are  some  who  would  argue  that  the  safety
regulator should be totally divorced from the setting  of  other  standards,
particularly those relating to the design, construction  and  alteration  of
the rolling stock and infrastructure or standards of  performance  generally
in the system, I believe that there is a nexus between the two  and  that  a
well-run and well-disciplined rail system, which is achieving  good  results
in other areas, will also tend to be safer.

Another important aspect of the Bill is that it  places  responsibility  for
the regulator within the Department of Transport. In terms of the Bill,  the
regulator will report to the Minister.

Ngamanye amazwi i-regulator  ayizilawuli  kodwa  izolawulwa  nguNgqongqoshe,
ngoba kuzoba nombiko njalo abawenzayo  kuNgqongqoshe  wethu  u-Dullah  Omar.
[In other words,  the  regulator  does  not  control  itself,  the  Minister
controls it, because they will occasionally  report  back  to  our  Minister
Dullah Omar.]

This is very important, because if the  regulator  was  placed  outside  the
department, that could provide an excuse for Government to  externalise  the
blame for any compromises in the  safety  standards.  If  the  regulator  is
outside the department, there may not be the same commitment  to  doing  the
job well.
Our rail transport system plays a very important  role  in  the  social  and
economic life of our country, and it is imperative that the system is safe.

While the railway transport system, generally, is one of  the  safest  modes
of transport, unpreventable accidents occur from time to time. Their  causes
are complex, deep-rooted and  only  superficially  explained  by  the  final
disastrous trigger, whether a broken rail, a  missed  signal,  a  mechanical
failure or human error. Time after time independent accident  investigations
reveal a complex web of shortcomings in rail operations.

These shortcomings will continue to persist unless we do something  to  make
rail operators  accountable  for  their  operations.  The  National  Railway
Safety Regulator Bill is one of the most important advances we have made  as
a means of mitigating the economic and social costs  of  railway  accidents.
It needs our support. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson and hon  members,  I  would  like  to
take this  opportunity  to  thank  the  committee  of  this  House  for  the
excellent work which it has done. I am  aware  of  the  proceedings  of  the
committee, the discussions that have taken  place  and  the  concerns  which
have been expressed. I want hon members to know that I take  those  concerns
very seriously. They will certainly be taken into account as we go along.

I say thank you very much to the committee for outstanding work and  to  the
chair of the committee for outstanding leadership. I also want to thank  all
those who participated in the debate today. I  believe  that  each  delegate
made an important contribution.

I would like to say, very briefly, that I have taken  note  of  the  concern
with regard to the composition of the board - the concern about the lack  of
specific reference  to  provinces  -  and  the  concern  that  there  is  no
reference to women in order to ensure that there  is  proper  representation
of women on the board. The issue of representation in respect of  those  two
issues is very important. Likewise, there are other issues,  such  as  rural
representation,   representation   by   disabled   persons   and    commuter
organisations.

All those issues are very,  very  important.  We  need  to  find  the  right
balance when the board is appointed. That is  why  the  Bill  provides  that
there must be a notice in the Gazette to invite nominations.  Therefore  all
stakeholders and role-players have  the  right  to  make  nominations.  Then
there must be a  panel  which  will  consider  names  which  have  been  put
forward, and the panel will compile a shortlist of names for  submission  to
the Minister.

The Bill  provides  that  the  panel  may  include  representatives  of  the
committees of Parliament. I believe that the  committees  can  play  a  very
important role in that process.  Therefore  the  concerns  which  have  been
expressed here must be remembered by all  of  us,  and  when  the  panel  is
established, committee members will be represented on the panel,  and  those
concerns  must  be  addressed  in  that  process.  Members  will  have   the
opportunity to make inputs in the compilation of the  shortlist,  so  as  to
ensure that when the shortlist is presented to the Minister, those  concerns
have indeed been taken into account.

One  can  debate  what  is  the  best   manner   of   ensuring   appropriate
representation, taking into account all those concerns. That is the  way  in
which the Bill provides, I think, for a way of  addressing  those  concerns,
and I hope that we will be able to empower the  committees,  and  Parliament
generally, so that the committees do indeed have the opportunity  of  making
that input.

The issue of crime at stations and in trains,  violence  against  people  at
stations and on trains, is one which has also been raised. I  refer  to  the
definition clause, because in the main  this  Bill  deals  with  operational
safety. It does not deal with what is  referred  to  in  the  definition  as
intentional harm perpetrated by people against  others,  or  property.  That
also is an issue which has been addressed by Government. It has been  a  big
concern throughout the country. And as members know, Government has  decided
to create a special division of the South African Police Service which  must
address the question of personal security, and prevention and  combating  of
crime.

This is not specifically addressed in this Bill, because this  Bill's  focus
is on operational  safety.  However,  it  is  not  an  area  that  has  been
neglected. It is receiving attention, and no doubt we will have occasion  to
address the House again with regard to these matters.

I am pleased that the hon delegate Mhlahlo from the  Eastern  Cape  referred
to SADC and Nepad, because indeed there is provision in the Bill to  promote
harmonisation within the SADC region. We  are  looking  in  that  direction.
Nepad, of course, is  our  bigger  vision,  and  already  within  the  Nepad
structures the issue of promoting rail across the continent and  harmonising
the rail system, as well as the regulations, are very much on the agenda  in
those discussions.

The last issue I want to address, one but the last, is the issue  of  level-
crossing deaths, and I am very grateful to the hon Dyonase  from  the  North
West for raising that question.  It  is  an  issue  which  has  been  raised
elsewhere, but now that the hon member has reminded  me  of  this  issue,  I
will certainly take it up. I will  take  it  up  with  the  operators,  with
Metrorail, with the SA Commuter Rail Corporation, and within the  Government
itself, so that we do not have to wait for the office of  the  regulator  to
begin to deal with this issue. If there is something that  we  can  do  now,
then I think it should be done, because it is quite true  that  many  deaths
do occur at the level crossings, and something has to be done, and  we  will
certainly be looking at this.

I must also compliment the Western Cape, and hon  comrade  Cameron  Dugmore,
for the initiative  in  the  Western  Cape,  setting  aside  money  to  make
provision for safety officers. I think it is very important  that  provinces
take this kind of initiative.

The last matter, on which I want to conclude, is to say that as members  are
aware, our vision for transport planning is that  such  planning  must  take
place at provincial and at local level. That is the direction  in  which  we
are moving. For example, with regard to the administration of subsidies,  we
have proposed  to  the  national  Treasury  that  that  function  should  be
devolved to the provinces. We have not yet  arrived  at  an  agreement  with
national Treasury, but that indeed is still the proposal of  the  Department
of Transport, which we are promoting in our discussions with Treasury.

We are also mindful of the legislation, which  we  ourselves  promoted,  the
National Land Transport Transition Act,  which  makes  provision  for  local
planning, and the need for local transport plans  to  be  prepared.  We  are
also mindful of other legislation,  which  makes  provision  for  integrated
transport planning at local level. Therefore it is appropriate that,  as  we
move forward, we empower provinces and  local  government,  so  that  indeed
they can plan, because they know best what the transport needs within  their
areas are.
I want to assure the House that I take those concerns that have been  raised
with regard  to  provincial  and  local  government  participation  -  local
government was not mentioned but I am sure members were thinking of that  as
well - very seriously, and no doubt we  will  come  back  to  the  House  to
indicate  the  progress  we  are  making  in  either   decentralisation   or
devolution of functions, so as to enable provinces and local governments  to
play a greater role in transport planning and implementation. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Bill  accordingly  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section   65   of   the
Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 19:23.
