                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that this week is World Environmental Week and that all
       communities should answer the plea of the Minister of Environmental
       Affairs and Tourism to lend a helping hand for a better life for all
       through the protection of our environment;


  (2) further notes that the Department of Environmental Affairs and
       Tourism is actively involved in the protection of our marine
       resources through the Subsistence Fisheries Management Programme,
       especially in the coastal areas;


  (3) compliments the department on its work with regard to the Mussel
       Rehabilitation Project at Koffie Bay and the extension of this coast-
       care project in the near future; and


  (4) applauds the Government of South Africa on the ordering of sea
       vessels that will enhance compliance in the utilisation of our marine
       resources, whilst the awarding of the contract also took into account
       the advancement of black economic empowerment in South Africa, and
       the significant contribution these vessels will make to research in
       the area of marine and coastal management.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, before you start:
Too many hon members are still not seated and they are hindering the
business of the House. Will you please take your seats.

Mr R J HEINE: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move:

  That this House -


  (1) notes the improbable but nonetheless serious allegations against
       Deputy President Jacob Zuma regarding his alleged involvement with Mr
       Pieter Rootman who claims he used stolen donor funds to pay off Mr
       Zuma's house;


  (2) further notes the call by the ANC's Western Cape leader that
       politicians against whom untested allegations have been made should
       resign; and


  (3) calls on the Deputy President to resign immediately pending a full
       investigation into these allegations.

[Interjections.]
Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chair, I give notice that I shall move on behalf of the
IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Government has agreed to -


       (a)  provide treatment to rape victims; and


       (b)  provide nevirapine to pregnant mothers and their babies;


  (2) now encourages the Minister of Health to address the urgent matter of
       HIV testing;


  (3) recognises also that people have as much right to information and
       knowledge as they do to secrecy; and


  (4) calls on the Government to -


       (a)  review its approach to one-on-one pretest counselling and to
           consider group pretest counselling, except for special
           circumstances relating to teenage children, with one-on-one
           posttest counselling for HIV-positive persons;


       (b)  investigate all forms of testing, including saliva testing; and


         c) focus less on anonymous testing than on getting the people who
            are tested to know their results.


Mr N B FIHLA: Chair, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Department of Correctional Services has opened the
       Ebongweni Maximum and the Kokstad Medium Prisons;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the new facilities will bring a measure of relief with regard to
           overcrowding in prisons ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, can you hear? Hon
member, maybe there is something wrong.
Mr N B FIHLA: I am sorry, Chair. May I repeat what I said? I give notice
that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Department of Correctional Services has opened the
       Ebongweni Maximum and the Kokstad Medium Prisons;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the new facilities will bring a measure of relief with regard to
           overcrowding in prisons which breeds gangsterism and further
           violence; and


       (b)  further believes that the maximum security in Ebongweni Prison
           will also address the question of prison escapes and will ensure
           that dangerous offenders remain behind bars for the duration of
           their sentences;


  (3) acknowledges that the total capital investment of half a billion rand
       made by Government in this project further indicates Government's
       commitment to the fight against crime and to building safer
       communities; and


  (4) commends the Department of Correctional Services for providing 633
       employment opportunities, in addition to jobs created during the
       construction of these facilities.

Dr P J RABIE: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the New NP deplores the unacceptable attempt by the United
           States Canned Producers to reduce the South African pear product
           status in terms of the US African Growth and Opportunity Act
           (AGOA);


       (b)  South African pear exports amount to 1% of the US market; and


       (c)  the South African deciduous fruit canning industry provides
           employment for 11 000 persons and sustains the livelihood of a
           further 25 000 families on farms; and


  (2) further notes that the New NP calls upon all role-players in the
       Government, industry and labour to insist that the US government
       implements the AGOA agreement regarding the duty-free status of South
       African canned fruit products.

Mr W G MAKANDA: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) views with extreme concern the total onslaught on black African
       tertiary institutions by the policies of the Minister of Education,
       the hon Kader Asmal, which are aimed at wiping them off the
       educational map;


  (2) affirms that the apartheid origins of these institutions is no more a
       crime than the racist origins of the traditionally white tertiary
       institutions which he is so determined to retain at the expense of
       the black colleges;


  (3) notes that the closure of Unitra brutally disempowers the community
       of Transkei who utilised that institution as day scholars at minimal
       cost and who will now have no access to tertiary education in their
       neighbourhood ...

[Time expired.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek namens die
AEB by die volgende sitting van die Huis sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van die stigting Saterdag in Bloemfontein van 'n
       Afrikaanse Leiersforum met die oog op die instelling van 'n
       Afrikanerraad ingevolge artikel 185 van die Grondwet;


  (2) meen dat die poging gesien moet word as 'n positiewe stap in die
       rigting van die eventuele seggenskap van gemeenskappe oor hul eie
       huishoudelike sake;


  (3) van mening is dat hierdie belange, anders as wat in die hoofartikels
       van sekere Afrikaanse dagblaaie beweer word, meer is as net taal,
       maar ook kultuur, historiese erfenis, onderwys, die Christelike
       lewensbeskouing en die reg op selfseggenskap oor hierdie interne
       aangeleenthede insluit;


  (4) 'n beroep doen op alle Afrikanerinstansies om eie klein agendas opsy
       te skuif en betreffende gemeenskaplike belange te konsolideer, terwyl
       die selfstandigheid van elke instelling erken word;


  (5) hoop daar sal onverpoosd gewerk word aan die daarstelling van 'n
       legitieme en verantwoordelike Afrikanerraad wat gereed sal wees om
       die voordele wat die nuwe wetgewing bied ten volle te benut; en


     6) aanbeveel dat ander gemeenskappe ook aangemoedig word om sodanige
        gemeenskapsrade daar te stel.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)
[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the AEB at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note of the establishment of an Afrikaans Leaders' Forum in
       Bloemfontein on Saturday, with a view to creating  an Afrikaner
       council in terms of section 185 of the Constitution;


  (2) feels that this effort must be viewed as a positive step in the
       direction of eventually giving communities a say in their own
       domestic affairs;


  (3) is of the opinion that these interests, contrary to what is alleged
       in the editorials of certain Afrikaans newspapers, represent more
       than just language, but also include culture, historical heritage,
       education, the Christian philosophy of life and the right to self-
       determination regarding these internal affairs;


  (4) calls upon all Afrikaner bodies to set aside their own petty agendas
       and to consolidate around common interests, while the independence of
       each body is recognised;


  (5) hopes that the establishment of a legitimate and responsible
       Afrikaner council that will be prepared to utilise the benefits that
       the new legislation presents to the full, will receive ongoing
       attention; and


  (6) recommends that other communities also be encouraged to form such
       community councils.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Zimbabwe is facing a serious food crisis which may result
       in a serious famine and loss of life in the coming months;


  (2) further notes that the production of maize, the main staple food,
       went down by 67% last year;


  (3) also notes that an appeal has been made to the international
       community to urgently provide emergency food assistance;


  (4) questions why the Mugabe government does not stop the lawlessness and
       madness of armed gangsters who continue to maim, displace and kill
       innocent people, including farmers who are feeding them; and


  (5) therefore calls on the Zimbabwean government to -


       (a)  reprioritise the needs of their country by ensuring the safety
           of all the farmers and their workers to enable them to continue
           producing food for all their people; and


       (b)  come to their senses and stop enriching themselves and their
           families by seizing for themselves white-owned farms they
           promised would be used to settle landless people.

Mr M I MOSS: Chairperson, the ANC gives notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the positive progress that has been made by the Government of
       South Africa with regard to the Ai-Ais Richtersveld Transfrontier
       Park to be established between the Republic of South Africa and
       Namibia;


  (2) notes that the Kokerboom is widely recognised as an environmental
       icon for the biome, better known as the Succulent Karoo, and that
       this representative sample of biodiversity will be granted protection
       for future generations through the establishment of this transborder
       conservation area; and


  (3) recognises that this initiative will create an ideal opportunity for
       cross-border tourism and job creation in one of the poorest provinces
       of South Africa.

[Applause.]

Mrs C I GCINA: Chair, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that health ministers, some of the continent's top scientists
       and representatives from donor organisations met at a conference in
       Somerset West on Monday to launch the African Aids Vaccine Programme
       (AAVP);


  (2) further notes that the AAVP was adopted by 45 heads of state during
       the 2001 African Summit on HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria in
       Abuja, Nigeria;


  (3) believes that this meeting will facilitate mobilising resources for
       research into a vaccine that is most suitable for Africa; and


  (4) wishes participants to this conference good luck in their
       deliberations.

[Applause.]

Mr C M LOWE: Chairman, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note of the statement by the Minister for Justice and
       Constitutional Development, Penuell Maduna, that ``donations should
       not be received from suspected criminal syndicates or even to rub
       shoulders with them'';


  (2) therefore expresses its surprise and disappointment at the visit of
       President Mbeki to President Muammar Gaddafi in Libya;


  (3) enquires whether the President will be seeking foreign funding for
       ANC coffers while travelling at taxpayers' expense; and


  (4) reminds the House that keeping company with tyrants and dictators
       creates doubt about the Government's own democratic credentials and
       gives the lie to Minister Maduna's pious remarks.

[Interjections.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move on behalf of
the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that –


       (a)  certain pieces of legislation passed by this honourable House,
           namely the Domestic Violence Act, the Maintenance Act and the
           Employment Equity Act, have not reached the masses of rural
           women; and


       (b)  this therefore creates a deep chasm between paper rights and
           living rights; and


  (2) therefore calls on the Government and the GCIS to embark on a massive
       education campaign to educate rural women on vital pieces of
       legislation.

[Applause.]

Mr C J M HLANEKI: Chairperson and honourable House, I give notice that I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that the former chief executive of the Lesotho Highlands
       Development Authority, Masupha Sole, was sentenced to 18 years in
       prison for taking bribes from international firms;


  (2) believes that this should send a warning to those entrusted with
       allocating contracts - as well as to international companies who do
       business in our region - that bribery is illegal and that those who
       accept bribes face the prospect of a long prison sentence; and


  (3) commends the Lesotho authorities for bringing this criminal to
       justice.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Voorsitter, ek gaan namens die Nuwe NP voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van die Wêreld-Ekonomiese Forum wat tans in Durban gehou
       word om voorbrand by die G8-leiers te maak vir tasbare steun aan die
       sosio-ekonomiese herlewingsplan vir Afrika wanneer hulle eersdaags in
       Kanada vergader om ontwikkelingshulp vir Nepad te oorweeg;


  (2) president Thabo Mbeki voorspoed toewens met sy planne om private
       inisiatief uit sowel Afrika as die res van die wêreld vir Nepad op te
       kommandeer om armoede op die kontinent deur ekonomiese groei en
       werkskepping uit te roei; en


     3) president Mbeki aanmoedig om hom nie deur protesaksies gegrond op
        vrees vir globalisering van stryk te laat bring nie, maar te
        demonstreer dat Afrika gereed is vir verandering en oop is vir
        besigheid.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) takes cognisance of the World Economic Forum which is currently being
       held in Durban to pave the way among the G8 leaders for tangible
       support for the socioeconomic renewal plan for Africa when they meet
       in Canada in the near future to consider development aid for Nepad;


  (2) wishes President Thabo Mbeki everything of the best on his plans to
       enlist private initiative from both Africa and the rest of the world
       for Nepad, in order to eradicate poverty on the continent by way of
       economic growth and job creation; and


  (3) encourages President Mbeki not to allow himself to be put off by
       protest actions based on a fear of globalisation, but to demonstrate
       that Africa is ready for change and open for business.]

                    GOLDEN JUBILEE OF QUEEN ELIZABETH II

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House, as one of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth -


  (1) congratulates Queen Elizabeth II on her Golden Jubilee; and


     2) wishes her well for the future.

Agreed to.

                  BEST WISHES FOR SEPARATED CONJOINED TWINS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) wishes twins Zinzi and Zanele Kona good health and good luck as they
       leave the Red Cross Children's Hospital to return home to Port
       Elizabeth;


  (2) welcomes the medical miracle which led to the conjoined twins being
       successfully separated; and
  (3) hopes that the two children will lead long, productive lives.

Agreed to.

                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! On 4 June, during the debate
on the Vote of Correctional Services, the hon T D Lee raised a point of
order regarding a remark made by the hon D V Bloem. I undertook to examine
Hansard before giving a ruling. Having had the opportunity to study
Hansard, I would like to give my ruling.

The hon Bloem, in referring to prisons, said: ``The hon Lee must not be so
quick to speak because, perhaps, he could be one of those who would serve
time.'' In the context in which the remark was made it was clear that the
hon Bloem was referring to the hon Lee being put in prison for some
undisclosed misdemeanour or transgression of the law. This is clearly
unacceptable as it reflects on the integrity of the member. I therefore
call upon the hon Bloem to withdraw the remark.

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, I withdraw it. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! He has withdrawn it.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 15 - Education:

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, hon members, members of the
education community, vice-chancellors who are here, MECs, chief executive
officers of the SA Qualifications Authority, the Council for Higher
Education and many other supporters of education, my dear students and
pupils from Fezeka High School in Guguletu and Phoenix High School in
Manenberg - I greet you.  [Applause.]

I am sure that this House will no doubt appreciate that the work of the
Department of Education, together with that of the provinces, covers a very
wide spectrum of activities geared to providing learning opportunities to
all South Africans. These details are spelt out before members in the
department's strategic plan.

As it is not possible to deal with all our many activities within the
confines of a budget debate, I wish to use this opportunity to highlight
some of our achievements by providing an overview of our efforts to build a
completely new education system out of the ashes of the old. In doing so, I
am reminded of the haunting words of the black American poet Melvin Tolson,
when he wrote:


  Out of abysses of illiteracy,
  Through labyrinths of lies,
  Across waste lands of disease ...
  We advance

Despite the many hardships and difficulties we have faced, we can
confidently claim that we have indeed advanced. We have laid the foundation
for a nonracial, democratic basis of the first truly national South African
school and higher education system.

Eight years into our new democracy, we have started to write a common
history. Prior to 1994, we had no unifying South African experience. Each
of the many parts of our nation experienced that history in a different
way, as they lived through different parts of it. There was no shared
experience, no common memory that bound us together, but only our disparate
and fragmented pasts. Now we are developing an emerging history, which
binds us all. Like Tolson we can say:


  Out of the dead-ends of poverty,
  Through the wilderness ...
  Across the barricades ...
  We advance!
  With the peoples of the world ...
  We advance

Since the unification of our country in 1994, we have begun tracking and
analysing the changes in our society. We therefore have a common starting
point for debates. We have national baselines against which we can measure
our growth. In this sense we are all part of documenting those historic
steps towards building a new nation.

Using these benchmarks, I have been able to report regularly to the nation
on progress in education. These reports include our publication on
achievements since 1994, and the very important quarterly reports to our
President on the state of education, which are compiled on the performance
of both the national and provincial departments of education. Of course the
hearings of the portfolio committee enable us to invigilate, question and
investigate all our policies. So in this climate of democratic
accountability the Ministry of Education is ready to be measured.

In opening up our processes we have created conditions for a new discourse
about education among all South Africans. No education system is a neutral
one; there are old values that bind that education system. Ours is based on
the Constitution and the process towards nation-building. So in recognition
of a nation-builder who has become very much part of us, for his passion
for the safety and security of our children, I hereby announce the
dedication of our very important Safe Schools Campaign to my former Cabinet
colleague, comrade and friend, the late Steve Tshwete. Hamba kahle [Go
well], Comrade Steve - your work will live on.

Our nation-building efforts as a Ministry are informed by our
constitutional mandate. In pursuing this mandate we have isolated two
themes which guide our work and determine our focus. In the first instance
we emphasise access to the goods and services that the Department of
Education should provide.

Our first test, therefore, for laws, policy or any decision that we make is
the question of equitable access and how this will affect the ability of
the poor to benefit from limited state resources. As a result we have
introduced some innovative provisions. The poorest 20% of our schools get
seven times as much nonpersonnel funding as the richest 20%. Anyone who
earns less than 10 times the school fee set is entitled to automatic
exemption; there is no discretion on this. And no child may be excluded or
penalised for want of fees.

In all our laws we have protected the rights of the poor to access general
education. Regrettably, despite the protection of the law, we know some
schools are turning away children because their parents are unable to pay
school fees or to provide school uniforms. School authorities are duty-
bound to protect the best interests of the child; by denying them access to
schools, they deny them hope.

As I am sure members will no doubt appreciate, access is not just about
expanding learning opportunities. It is also about ensuring that all our
children, especially the poor, exercise their right to basic education in
conditions that enable them to learn effectively. It is about access to
quality infrastructure. As indicated in our School Register of Needs - we
are the only country that has a school register of needs - we have made
remarkable progress in dealing with the infrastructure backlogs in our
schools, especially in the provision of on-site water and sanitation, the
number of classrooms built, and Microsoft's  remarkable gift of
connectivity for ICT. However, while much has been achieved, we still have
a long way to go to eradicate all the backlogs inherited from our shameful
apartheid past.

In line with the President's injunction that no child should learn under a
tree, as he announced in the state of the nation address earlier this year,
we will intensify our efforts to end the conditions of physical degradation
in our schools. Such conditions threaten the health of students and
teachers alike and radically restrict the social and teaching activities of
schools. We shall interpret the President's statement as meaning any
condition in a school which is dangerous to the children and which is
dangerous to the health of the children. To this end provinces have been
requested to submit business plans, indicating how they will deal
decisively with this matter in the next Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
cycle. I look forward to the submission of these business plans.

In regard to participation rates, we are effectively at full enrolment in
our general education band, with gross enrolment ratios over 100% in many
areas. We are continuing to expand the system in various ways. One of the
most significant ways is in the provision of a preschool year for all
children. This is being introduced at 2 800 community-based sites, all
located in the areas identified by the President for urgent intervention.
By 2010 we plan to have all 800 000 children aged five in a reception year.
Very significant also is the fact that over 50% of our children in schools
are female. This is without parallel in Africa.

Another significant area of expansion is the inclusion of children with
special educational needs, be they physical, emotional or intellectual.
These children will no longer be isolated in special schools at the margins
of the education system. They will now be mainstreamed in specially
prepared schools which are being built at present.

Currently, teachers are being trained to absorb these children into the
normal learning environments. It is estimated that there are a large number
of children with special needs that are out of school at the moment. Their
inclusion will therefore be another major step towards universal access.

I would also ask members of the National Assembly to join us in the
education of our families, our teachers and our governing bodies. These
children with special educational needs are stigmatised and very often
their right to dignity is being violated. An education process is
necessary, therefore, to ensure that they are treated like children in the
ordinary schools of our country. A huge education process is therefore
necessary to ensure that the shame of illtreatment is removed.

We have also increased resources for literacy and adult education. The
illiterate and underqualified are the poor. We have now created
opportunities for them to participate effectively in the education system.
Adult education centres now have formal recognition. Their programmes focus
on very relevant issues, such as SMME management, technology, hospitality
and tourism, and agriculture.

In the year 2000 the education community, the provinces and the state spent
R200 million on Abet. Last year this amount increased to R822 million. By
the year 2004 we will spend in the region of R1,2 billion. In addition, the
Government has allocated R110 million over three years to the Ikhwelo
Poverty Relief Project for the establishment of 60 more adult education
centres nationwide.

Further education, a rather unknown part of our education system, has also
seen significant developments, which will enhance access for millions of
our youth and adults who have not been part of the vocational stream of
education. We are turning our 150 technical colleges, following a very
painful structuring process, into 50 high-status institutions with
significant capacity, and are revising the programmes to meet the needs of
individuals, industry and communities. Through these efforts we will also
remove the stigma associated with vocational and technical education by
demonstrating its educational value and its value in the labour market.

In higher education, after protracted debates, we have been able to build a
national consensus around the restructuring of our institutions. All role-
players now agree on the need to refocus and strengthen the system of
higher education.

Much has been said in this House over the past three years on the need for
the radical transformation of the higher education system. This call is
sure to gain momentum after the Cabinet's recent decision to approve
Government's ground-breaking proposal for the transformation and
reconstruction of higher education. These proposals mark a turning point
for higher education, away from the divisive past shaped by the
geopolitical imagination of apartheid planners, to a confident future in
which higher education will effectively meet the needs of the whole nation
and not a select few.

There are areas in the current system which perform reasonably well.
However, the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the system are
compromised by a number of factors, such as the paucity of graduate and
research outputs, the quality of teaching, the incapacity of management and
governing bodies, the lack of representivity among staff, institutional
cultures that have not transcended the divides of the past, and the
emergence of increased anarchic competition between institutions.

Our response to this unacceptable situation has been decisive. It is one
that will touch every higher education institution in the country. The new
system will comprise 21 higher education institutions, consisting of 11
universities, six technikons and four comprehensive institutions. In
addition - and I agree with the MEC from the Northern Cape - we are setting
up new bodies in the Northern Cape and Mpumalanga that we are naming the
National Institutes for Higher Education in Mpumalanga and the Northern
Cape. So while the reconstruction of the architecture of the system will
provide the institutional basis for change, it is not the heart of the
transformation process.

It is unusual to address in a budget speech a particular motion presented
in this House. I know that the UDM is new to public life. Judging from
their behaviour I hope that they will not last very long in public life,
because it is quite clear that the intellectual poverty which resulted in
this motion before us leads to the kind of tribalism and divisiveness that
we had removed from our public life. I talk for the Eastern Cape, not for a
so-called Transkei. That is very important.

Teaching in Umtata will be developed further. Umtata will become a viable,
vibrant place for learning and teaching. In addition to technikon type
education, Umtata will be the centre for distance education, community
development, and regional development. If the member has a pipe, he will
put that in his pipe and if he is able to do so, he will light it and smoke
it ... [Laughter.] ... because this kind of illiteracy in this House does
not do justice to the remarkable progress we have made in trying to get an
agreement about the real future of our education system, which deserves
further and more serious consideration.

Transformation, therefore, requires that the system be expanded and made
accessible to a broader and more diverse group of students. We propose to
increase our participation rate from 15% to 20% over the next ten years by
recruiting an additional 200 000 students into the system. The
participation rates of coloureds and Africans are appalling, namely 12% to
14% of the group aged 18 to 24 years. For whites it is 42%, which puts them
in the highest category in the world. For Indians it is 39%. So we can no
longer tolerate the exclusion of large parts of our community. Therefore,
we must take measures to bring most students into the higher education
system.

The National Student Financial Aid Scheme will support many of these
students. This scheme is undoubtedly one of the most successful mechanisms
to promote equity and redress in higher education. We go for redress for
individuals, for groups of people, and not for mythical institutions. This
year alone, we have provided R800 million in loans and grants. A total of
232 000 young people have gone through higher education because of the
Government's National Student Financial Aid Scheme.

Transformation also requires that we pay attention to the curriculum in
higher education and to the quality of teaching and learning. I will soon
be calling a conference with key role-players in higher education to
address this matter so as to ensure that the curriculum reflects the values
and ethos of our democracy. In addition, the power structure and the
culture of the formally privileged institutions must undergo fundamental
change to reflect the constitutional and political imperatives of our
society. [Interjections.]

Mr G B D McINTOSH: How?

The MINISTER: In Greytown there is no higher education system and the
member does not know what happens in the higher education system.

The strategies for the transformation of the higher education system are at
last in place. The Higher Education Act provides for a three-month period
in which role-players can make representations regarding their views on the
Government's proposals. I look forward to these responses. Much work has to
be done in the coming months. However, we have no choice. We must turn the
higher education system around. We must transcend the divisions of our past
if we are to meet the aspirations and the hopes of future generations of
South Africans.

It is clear that we have vastly improved access to education, and are
continuing to do so. We are therefore in full support of the objectives of
the Dakar Declaration of 2000, pledging education in primary and secondary
schools for all by the year 2015.

The second theme which I mentioned earlier, and which frames our efforts,
is that of success. We cannot build a high-quality education system by
simply increasing access. We also need to ensure that our learners, our
pupils, are able to achieve their true potential.

The importance of this is reflected, for example, in higher education where
only 15% who enter the system actually graduate. This is clearly an
enormous waste of both human and financial resources. It is for this reason
that we will deal squarely with improving success rates in the
implementation of our National Plan for Higher Education.

I am sure that hon members will agree that, without doubt, the matric
results of 2001 have been a key milestone in our efforts to ensure success.
From a starting point of below 50% not so long ago, we have improved the
national pass rate to over 60%. However, that is only one indicator. We
have therefore gone beyond that and inquired more deeply into the soul of
the system. What we have found in schools was not very healthy.

Some schools have failed to embrace the values and symbols of our new
democracy. We found often that religion, in certain instances, was being
handled in a very insensitive manner. We found a culture of bullying and
abuse. We found teachers and principals who preached democracy, but acted
like dictators in the classroom. Respect for authority, which we must
support and develop, must be earned by personal behaviour.

We do not wish to expand access to these types of learning areas. We have
therefore embarked on a number of initiatives which seek to change the
ethos of our schools so that they support a democratic climate and promote
the values enshrined in our Constitution.

Our primary instrument in this regard is through the revision of the
National Curriculum Statement based on firm, irrevocable support for
outcomes-based education. Apart from the necessary streamlining of the
design, the statement provides profound new directions with respect to
human rights, national identity, an appreciation of the great diversity - I
draw Mr Aucamp's attention to this - of this nation, and innovative
approaches to learning. The new statement will be introduced in the
Foundation Phase in 2004.

We have also played a leading role in the national campaign to instil a
moral purpose in our society through our associated Values in Education
initiative. The South African History Project has a special focus on the
content and quality of history teaching, and the revitalisation of
individual knowledge as part of the curriculum. These are important
achievements which have changed not just the way we do business, but also,
more importantly, the very reasons as to why we do it. We have tried to
ensure that all the role-players engaged in education share a passion and a
commitment towards our special responsibilities.

Sadly, our successes are threatened. Vigilance is the price of democracy,
and we cannot allow our hard-won gains to be compromised. There are two
threats currently confronting us: One is indiscipline, and the other is
HIV/Aids.

We have recently seen yet another bout of unacceptable and undisciplined
behaviour by some students. They have damaged property, burnt buildings and
looted from the poor. In doing so, they have burnt their own homes, stolen
from and injured their own mothers and fathers and, of course, they have
given away their own education. We must remind our students about what
Bertolt Brecht, an extraordinary revolutionary, said:


  Never forget that men like you got hurt, that you may sit here ... and
  now don't shut your eyes, and don't desert, but learn to learn ...

The overwhelming majority of our people, both black and white, want a new
life for themselves, especially those who have been deprived in the past.
The few cannot be allowed to destroy these hopes and dreams. The majority
deserve our support while they study to become the future leaders of our
country.

There is a need for a serious debate about the whole matter of discipline
and accountability in education. Discipline must be a central component of
all that we do. For real change to take place, we require the highest
levels of ethical and professional behaviour from our administrators and
officials as well as from our teachers and lecturers.

The second threat confronting us is that of HIV/Aids. It stands to
undermine all our successes. It is a real threat and a current one. This
threat is undoubtedly compounded by the levels of sexual abuse found in our
sites of learning. Last week, we held the first ever National Conference on
HIV/Aids and Education, which was attended by over 500 delegates from all
over the country. Together we applied our collective wisdom in developing a
creative and humane response to the crisis. I hope we can have a debate in
this House on how to deal with HIV and education.

Mine is a small department whose budget is insignificant in relation to
national spending on education and which operates under the framework of
our Constitution with the provinces. Our successes are not therefore ours
alone to claim. They are a result of the hard work displayed by all those
who have worked hand-in-hand with us on this difficult but necessary
journey.

In this regard, I must express my appreciation to all our partners. This
includes the teachers, the unions, the university and technikon
communities, and the MECs for Education together with their officials. I
also wish to thank our donor community, both local and international, for
the continued support and solidarity they have shown for our transformation
agenda. [Applause.]

We are now practising joined-up government. We work very closely with the
Department of Labour, not only in terms of quality assurance, but also in
terms of all the other areas that impinge on education. This also requires
our special thanks.

My sincerest gratitude goes to the portfolio committee, under the
leadership of the able chairperson, Shepherd Mayatula, which has virtually
sat in permanent session this year. My special thanks go to the Deputy
Minister, Mosibudi Mangena, who has led his areas of responsibility with
quiet passion and dedication. His involvement has cemented a patriotic
alliance that supersedes narrow party political interests.

I must pay special tribute also to my Director-General and officials who
have had to work inordinate hours to meet the new challenges posed.
Finally, I must praise my personal staff for their continued support.

Let me end by saying that, in our celebrations, we must not forget the
telling words of the great poet William Blake, adapted to the South African
context, when he wrote:


  I will not cease from Mental Fight
  Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand
  Till we have built Jerusalem ...
... in South Africa's diverse and pleasant land

Our own Jerusalem is an education system for the 21st century. Together we
will build it. [Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Mr Chairperson, the hon the Minister, colleagues, members of
governing bodies, teachers and learners, the enormous importance of
education in laying the foundation for addressing the development needs of
our democratic country cannot be overemphasised. The foregoing explains why
the nation as a whole focuses so much on this department.

So, the crucial questions are: Is the taxpayers money being spent
appropriately? Are we making bold, effective moves towards quality
education for all?

Certainly, there have been significant improvements in certain areas. For
example, as the Minister indicated, the comparatively good performance of
the Grade 12 class of 2000 was consolidated last year, though qualitatively
no significant improvement was noticeable, especially in critical subjects
such as mathematics and science.

We also note with appreciation the bold and tenacious intentions of the
Minister to restructure and transform higher education in spite of
strenuous resistance from some quarters. Fragmented along racial and ethnic
lines, the higher education system has reflected severe social
inequalities, and this situation cannot be allowed to continue. We wish the
Minister well in this herculean task, and hope that he soon strikes some
accord with the relevant stakeholders.

However, the entire education system still reflects grave shortcomings,
which we cannot deny. School infrastructure improvement paints a very sad
picture. Provinces have spent, on average, in the previous financial year,
only 71% of the money allocated for that programme. Whatever the reasons
may be, it is the poor, historically disadvantaged teachers and learners
who suffer most. Usually, they are located in rural areas. It is high time
that we start showing care and empathy for the poor, for whom education is
the only way to escape from poverty by providing the necessary resources.

Equally sad is the underspending by provincial education departments on
HIV/Aids education, which the Minister touched on. Only R25 million was
spent while R38 million still lies in the coffers. The two worst performing
provinces are the Eastern Cape and Limpopo. Again, it was largely the poor,
historically disadvantaged learners who were the victims.

The Minister should indicate to this House how he is going to ensure that
the provincial departments have the structures in place to ensure proper
implementation of the Aids education budget. We suggest, in the meantime,
that such moneys should be channelled to organisations that are serious
about combating Aids.

The quality of the schooling system also needs improvement. The
developmental appraisal system never got under way. Yes, indeed, the
department did develop the whole-school evaluation and systematic
evaluation programmes. However, we have not seen much of it happening on
the ground. For the quality of education to improve a holistic approach to
these things is essential. It is totally unacceptable, partly because of
lack of proper evaluation, that in many schools learners are still wasting
their time. They are virtually on the road to nowhere.

How can a learner remain positive and motivated in a school with a 0% pass
rate, where basics of accountability do not exist, and where many teachers
are not even good role models? The image of the teaching profession suffers
further because of certain teachers who have criminal tendencies. They
indulge in rape and drug abuse. We suggest that the Government, with the
unions, should flush out such teachers as a matter of urgency.

I would like to deal briefly with the issue of the pervasive uncertainty
regarding curricular development. We are aware that Grade 9 learners should
be evaluated at the end of the year according to OBE Curriculum 2005. The
crucial question is: Who will do the evaluation? Is it going to be done at
provincial, district or school level? If it is going to be school level,
are our teachers equipped to handle this complicated process? What is cause
for further concern is the Grade 10-to-12 learners who will be moving on.
If they are going to move to the traditional method of education, it seems
that this will create problems, because the learning areas and the subjects
in the old syllabi certainly do not articulate matters properly. Perhaps,
the Minister will clarify matters regarding that.

I would now like to reflect on the conduct of students and learners. The
conduct of students at the University of the North is shocking. It is
disgraceful that students should resort to destroying property because they
have been denied enough money to drown their sorrows in liquor. During the
apartheid regime, violence was imported to the institutions by apartheid
agents. Today, the source of destruction comes from within. This comes at a
time when higher education is increasingly becoming accessible to many poor
but deserving students.

These events, linked to the behaviour of Cosas, are disturbing in that the
Government certainly has done more than the previous apartheid regime. We
should ask ourselves: Why do these students not buy into our society? What
prevents them from behaving in a normal way? Perhaps we need to reflect on
that. How do they feel knowing that Government Ministers and the black
elite, including their own teachers, send their children to former Model C
schools and private schools, and, most likely, later to historically white
universities? In short, they find themselves living in the same parlous
conditions that existed under apartheid. Their parents are still poor.
Their economic and social circumstances have remained static. For them
black empowerment happens only to those with political connections to
people who matter.

Yes, indeed, these are possibly serious omens that we have not advanced
enough to improve the quality of our education. We in the DP are committed
to providing relevant, nondiscriminatory quality education for all, because
we believe that education is a means to self-fulfilment and the development
of people's full potential. [Interjections.] We believe that education is a
means to contribute to progress and prosperity for the country and all its
people, a key to addressing unemployment, and a critical success factor in
making our economy globally competitive.

Quality education in the classroom is non-negotiable. Standards in
education must be guaranteed by means of benchmarking, enforcement of
norms, assessment and certification. Where excellence currently exists, as
seen in independent and private schools, it must be acknowledged and
protected.

The DA believes that it is important to instil discipline and core values
at school level. Without these things, there is no hope for the future.
[Applause.]

Prof S M MAYATULA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, guests and
students, allow me to open this debate with the wise words of Jesper Morch,
the Unicef representative to South Africa, who said, and I quote:


  As we embark on the next phase of work towards the realisation of
  children's rights, we are guided by the lessons learned in pursuing the
  goals of the 1990 world summit for children and inspired by the comments
  proposed for the next decade. In a global movement for children, heads of
  state and government from every corner of the world, the children of the
  world and civil society leaders are resolved to ensure that: all children
  have access to quality basic education, health and nutrition; all
  children are protected from exploitation and violence; and all children
  have the possibility to live in a world free from HIV/Aids.

Article 28 of the Children's Rights Charter states, and I quote:

  The child has a right to education, and the state's duty is to ensure
  that primary education is free and compulsory, to encourage different
  forms of secondary education accessible to every child and to make higher
  education available to all on the basis of capacity. School discipline
  shall be consistent with the child's rights and dignity. The state shall
  engage in international co-operation to implement this right.

Section 29(1)(a) of our Constitution and the South African Schools Act have
translated these declarations into laws that govern and protect our
children. The education budget that we are debating today is geared towards
breathing life into these noble intentions.

The computer software donation by Microsoft that was announced by the
President in his state of the nation address this year, which is a stepping
stone in building the bridges for our learners to access and utilise
technology to ensure that they are digitally literate, has already been
turned into a contract that commenced on 21 May 2002 and ends on 31
December 2004. The programme is targeting approximately 32 000 schools that
have severely limited financial resources and little hope of purchasing
modern information and communication technology.

The department has put aside money for the following programmes, among
others, to which my colleagues will refer. The higher education sector has
received R7,99 billion; financial management and quality enhancement have
received R224,320 million; the early childhood development grant has
received R52 million this year; Thuba Makote - Schools as Centres of
Community Development programme has received R34 million; the national
Ikhwelo project has received R40 million in this year's budget; and the
HIV/Aids programme received a grant of R142 million.
This brings me to the HIV/Aids conference that was hosted by the Department
of Education in Johannesburg last week, where the hon the Minister, Prof
Kader Asmal, reminded us, and I quote:


  Education is a social vaccine against HIV/Aids.

The highlight of the conference was the live presentation of real stories
by little children who shared their HIV/Aids-related experiences. These
included how they had been orphaned and had to look after their siblings;
how they had been raped by their own relatives; how they did not have money
for uniforms and as a result were sent home from school; how they went to
school hungry but their schools would not allow them to participate in the
feeding scheme because they had not paid their school fees; and how some
teachers went the extra mile and assisted them both emotionally and
financially. We salute those teachers.

Some children boldly declared their HIV-positive status. These stories left
an indelible mark on the minds of most delegates. We are living in a cruel
world. Some of our people have lost their sense of ubuntu. Our good
policies and laws are either unknown or deliberately ignored. How on earth
can a person deprive a hungry child of food, let alone state food?

According to the South African Schools Act, schooling up to Grade 9 is free
and compulsory in our country. Under no circumstances should anybody
prevent children from attending school. As if the children's stories were
not bad enough, we also got reports that despite the good work done by the
South Africa Council of Educators in deregistering a number of offending
teachers, there were still some teachers who continued to have sexual
relations with learners. This is culturally and morally reprehensible, and
the educators' code of ethics does not allow it.

These teachers are taking advantage of vulnerable learners who out of
respect cannot stop their advances. They not only deflower and demoralise
them, but they also infect them with HIV/Aids. To such people, Leopus Kalka
had this to say, and I quote:


  The purpose of life is to help others and if you cannot help them, would
  you at least not hurt them?

In the name of Letsema, let us all join hands to root out this scourge. Let
our communities, school governing bodies, principals, teacher unions and
student unions break their silence. They should break the rules of
protocol, if there are any, and report these cases directly to the heads of
departments, MECs, the South African Council of Educators, the national
Minister of Education and even the Portfolio Committee on Education. Let us
engage in a campaign to name and shame such teachers.

As we debate this budget in this month which has been declared Youth Month,
we cannot ignore the horrible incidents involving our youth that occurred
in the past two weeks, to which the hon Ntuli referred. I am referring to
the burning down of property at the University of the North and the violent
behaviour of our youth in the streets of Johannesburg. One cannot help but
ascribe this behaviour to reactionary individuals who continue to tarnish
the name of the organisation for their own narrow and ill-informed, selfish
needs. Ironically, all these acts are committed in the name of education.

In the dark days of apartheid, blacks were treated like slaves and worse
than animals in the land of their birth. They had no rights whatsoever. The
violent reaction of the apartheid regime to peaceful protest left students
with no option but to retaliate with everything at their disposal. In some
instances this included violence. However, there is no reason to resort to
such archaic forms of protest, as the democratic dispensation allows for
dialogue and constructive engagement.

In this day and hour, when the whole continent is looking up to our youth
for leadership and guidance, I was happy when I heard that the Youth
Commission was moving around, campaigning for clean-ups in different towns.
This shows that the majority of our youth out there still have the moral
fibre that we need.

As we speak, our country is hosting an important Nepad conference. When
section 23(2)(c) of our Constitution gives us the right to strike, there
can be no excuse for the use of any form of force or violence, however
aggrieved our people might be.

The report on the transformation and reconstruction of the higher education
system was unveiled last Thursday. It is a great improvement on the report
of the working group. The relevant structures have a further three months
to make their comments before it is finalised. I will not comment on the
proposed measures for now, but I will confine myself to the broad
objectives outlined in the national plan, which we sometimes lose as we
discuss the real mergers.

I am referring to increasing access and producing graduates with the skills
and competences necessary to meet the human resource needs of the country.
I am referring to the special attention which is going to be paid to
ensuring that the fee structures and admission requirements of these
restructured institutions do not adversely impact on access. I am referring
to the promotion of equity of access and outcomes, and to reducing past
inequalities by ensuring that student and staff profiles reflect the
demographic composition of South Africa. I am referring to promoting
institutional diversity in order to meet national and regional skills and
knowledge. The plan refers to building research capacity, including
maintaining existing research strengths and ensuring that research
contributes to the national development needs.

The new academic policy is intended to improve the portability of our
education qualifications, thus promoting greater student mobility between
different institutions and qualifications. This will go a long way in
addressing the plight of many students who are roaming the streets with
incomplete degrees because they lack one or two courses which they can only
complete by going back to their original institutions.

I am referring to the equity targets which, it is said, should focus on the
fields in which black and women students are under-represented,
particularly business, commerce, science, engineering and technology
programnes, as well as postgraduate programmes in general. If members look
at our research output, members will find that women represent less than
2%. If we do not consciously try to change this around, it will never
change. That our Parliament has as many women represented here as it has
was not through a stroke of lightning, but through a conscious decision
that there was a need to include them, not only to be with us, but to lead
as they do in many departments even now.

Equity in access must be complemented by equity in outcomes, through the
development of academic development programmes. Language will not be
allowed to act as a barrier to access or success. I remember when I was
recruited by my professor to do my honours degree in economics. In the
second week he referred me to a number of so-called very important pieces
of literature in Afrikaans. I told him there and then that I was not going
to read that. I would rather fail before I started than start and be part
of my own failure in the process.

In conclusion, whatever shortcomings the Department of Education might
have, I think we can all agree that it does have a plan which is contained
in this document. It does have a vision and there is a definite positive
movement forward. If we all join hands and do our little bit, victory is
certain. The ANC supports this Vote. [Applause.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members ...

... bafowethu nodadewethu, manene namanenekazi [brothers and sisters,
ladies and gentlemen ...]

... the delivery of quality education is a significant step towards social
progress, social justice and affirmation of individual dignity. This is in,
fact, a constitutional imperative.

Prior to 1994, South Africa's education system was fragmented along racial
and ethnic lines. Today we have a department that is united and co-
ordinated, amalgamating the various departments into a single entity. Today
there is better co-operation between national and provincial departments.
This is a significant achievement. [Applause.] Wait! [Laughter.]

I have no intention of undermining the above achievements, but they are
simply structural and legal. The IFP believes that education is not simply
a commodity, but a human right. I know that through various legislative
efforts and budgetary interventions, such as the one we are discussing this
afternoon, the department is striving towards the achievement of the basic
education ideal. But an hour's visit to the countryside still tells one a
story of neglect, deprivation, wastefulness and inefficiency.

Wastefulness and inefficiency are the two ills that are inflicting the most
harm on our recuperating system of education. One example of wastefulness
is the overdependency on consultants. Although consultants are necessary,
we are wasting funds by relying too much on them when we should rather be
strengthening those whom we have employed. What baffles me is the fact that
a manager who was inefficient in his job suddenly becomes a good consultant
upon resignation.

It appears that the policy and structural changes have not had the desired
effect of galvanising and strengthening our system of education. We are
concerned that the policy changes have not been accompanied by sufficient
attitudinal changes to turn the system rapidly towards the achievement of
the desired goals of efficiency and quality.

We have said this before, and we want to repeat it today. We - especially
those who were disadvantaged - must stop behaving like victims, because a
victim will always whine, cringe and succumb to his or her situation and
wallow in self-pity. Aikhona! No! We must rise above what is seemingly
insurmountable. Inefficiency, indolence, greed, foot-dragging, nepotism,
incompetence, favouritism, drug abuse, harassment, drunkenness,
maladministration, demotivation, you name it - all these are self-
inflicted, but curable diseases.
As we have pointed out already, the department can boast a number of
educational reforms; yet it seems there is something that we are just not
doing right.

Students of military strategy - I am tempted to look at the right side of
the House; of course I can look at this side too - will know that timing is
everything. Those who are familiar with township slang will know what we
are talking about when we refer to an older person as a timer - I am not
referring to the Minister. It is because we connect that man with the
experience he has.

Sithi umuntu akathayimi. [We say a person does not time well.]

I am saying timing is everything. Doing the right things in the wrong order
and at the wrong time invariably leads to disappointment and often to
failure to achieve the original objectives.

Outcomes-based education, OBE, and Curriculum 2005 were good policy
changes, necessary for the mindset change which looks at phenomena with
critical thinking as opposed to the old carbon-paper way of learning. The
introduction of the core curriculum, OBE, has however been marred by
inadequate preparation. Our human component is simply not able to deliver
the revolution that the new curriculum is calling for.

We need to develop a new teacher training strategy as a response to both
the demands of the new curriculum and the attrition which is a result of
the HIV/Aids pandemic. The present teacher training strategy is simply
inadequate, or even unsuitable to the present situation. We do have
proposals in this regard. Let us start serious discussions on the teacher
training strategy where we can explore various models. I know, of course,
that both the Department of Labour and of Education have developed a human
development strategy, but I am calling for a more specific and focused
discussion on teacher training, not in a once-off conference.

We must remember that different provinces have their own peculiar needs and
requirements. This, therefore, calls for a multistrategy approach to
teacher training. For the system to work efficiently and effectively, it
will depend on a supply of teachers who have learnt the best of available
practices, rather than simply perpetuating traditional teaching strategy.
Teacher training may rightly be defined as a provincial competence which
does not fall within the realm of the national debate.

This leads me to another weakness of the system, which is a source of major
concern to us, and that is accountability. The present confused
accountability for the nation's education system may lie at the heart of
its poor performance.

Evidently, responsibility cannot safely be divorced from authority if
people and organisations are to be held accountable for their actions and
the results they achieve with the resources at their disposal. Yet this
divorce has characterised our education system at all levels. Each time
teachers are not paid and support material is not delivered, district
managers shift the blame to regional offices, and regional offices shift
the blame to provincial offices, and provincial offices shift the blame to
the supplier - the supplier who on occasion does not have the necessary
resources to deliver. We have seen this in the case of the Eastern Cape. I
am not singling out the Eastern Cape; this is prevalent in most provinces.

Clearer accountability for different aspects of the education system is
urgently required. I think we have a meeting of minds here. I heard the
Minister also mentioning that accountability is a problem in our education
system.

Better management training for both principals and district officials is
also an urgent need. I know that district renewal courses have been
offered, but these have been described by independent observers as patchy
and mediocre. We propose the establishment of an institution or centres to
help potential principals and managers, on an ongoing basis, to acquire the
skills and knowledge they will need in what is a new management era for
education.

At school level, efforts should be concentrated on eliminating the waste
and inefficiency that sometimes go with teaching empty desks. Parents,
teachers and learners need to know how well they are mastering the new
curriculum and vision.

We are a product of unequal treatment and to a large extent our education
landscape still reflects that legacy of discriminatory practices in the
allocation of resources. Our budget, in accordance with our unequal past,
must be a corrective one. It needs to take account of the particular
problems of teaching both in urban and in deprived rural areas.

For instance, what are the budgetary incentives for those who teach in
deprived rural areas? The introduction of norms and standards in the
funding of schools has been a welcome policy intervention, but it has
unfortunately resulted in roll-overs, because schools lack budgetary
capacity and skills. [Interjections.] The IFP is not in the habit of saying
``we told you so''. We support this Vote. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr L M KGWELE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy Minister, hon
members, after listening to the inputs of the hon Mr Ntuli of the
``Deurmekaar Alliance'', the DP - Harksen alliance, I am inclined to agree
with Winston Churchill that ``a pessimist sees the difficulty in every
opportunity, an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty''.

DP/DA ba tshwana le dintsi tse ditala, bo mabodisa nama, tse di sa jeng
nama mme di etalafatsa fela. [The DP/DA are like green flies whose job it
is to make meat rotten. They actually do not eat meat but just make it
green in colour.]

They are spoilers. As we celebrate the turning of the tide of the matric
results and the overall success of appropriate interventions by the
Department of Education, we need to recognise that education is the seed
and flower of development. Indeed, broad-based and high-quality education
reduces poverty and inequality, and is essential for sustained economic
growth. Combined with good macroeconomic policies, it is fundamental to the
construction of democratic societies and globally competitive economies.

It is the key to creating, applying and spreading new ideas and
technologies, which in turn are critical to sustained high growth. It
augments cognitive and other skills, which in turn improve the productivity
of labour. Better educated women are more effective in improving household
welfare, promoting children's health and enhancing intergenerational social
and economic benefits for their children. Education is also the great
equaliser and the ultimate liberator in that it provides poor people with
access to productive assets such as land and capital, and empowers them to
make personal choices.

It is important that I should emphasise that with regard to school
education - which is the focus of my input in this debate - the national
department is responsible for policy-making, monitoring and support, while
provinces are responsible for the actual service delivery and financing of
education.

The total learner support material allocated for 2002, calculated from the
individual allocations to provinces amounts to R1,2 billion. This
represents an increase of R392,6 million on the amount for the 1998-99
financial year. Despite the amount of funding made available, very few
provinces reported, we must admit, 100% delivery of learner support
material to schools before the first day of school.

By May some schools in provinces such as the Eastern Cape had not received
learner support material. However, we should acknowledge that delivering
learner support material to more than 30 000 schools is a huge logistical
task, filled with problems ranging from lack of security at schools to
delays in tender processes. Other problems include failure by the most
critical structure in the delivery of service, the district, in providing
ongoing support to schools, and the return rate of textbooks to schools.

Despite all these problems, provinces such as Limpopo have been successful
with regard to the delivery of learner support material. The province has
already started with the requisitions for next year's learner support
material.

We need to focus on the functionality of districts and to ensure that
officials at this level of service are held accountable for service
delivery and are responsive to the needs of communities. We should make
sure that these officials regularly visit schools and give support to
school managers and school governing bodies. We should not blame the system
for the incompetence of individuals.

In order to alleviate the plight of learners who go to school without food,
the department has prioritised the extension of the net of the primary
school nutrition programme to reach more than 4 719 489 learners who
currently benefit from the scheme. As the ANC, we wish to support the
process of review of the programme, specifically in areas of coverage,
targeting and menus, so that the system is effective and achieves its
intended purpose, and reaches all needy learners across the board. We hope
that such a review would also appropriately locate the programme for
effective monitoring and evaluation.

In support of this Vote I also wish, on behalf of the ANC, to congratulate
the Ministry of Education on a successful conference on HIV/Aids in the
education sector, held over the past weekend in Johannesburg. Given the
enormity of the challenges posed by the pandemic, the conference proved
vital in finding holistic solutions to the intricate array of challenges.
[Interjections.] Unfortunately, no members of the opposition attended that
conference or participated as speakers. [Interjections.]

The conditional grant for HIV/Aids was introduced in the Supplementary
Budget for 2000-2001 and was tabled in Parliament on 14 June 2000.
[Interjections.] A total amount of R31,295 billion was granted for
education in 2000-2001, of which R26 930 billion was allocated to
provincial education departments and R4 365 billion to the Department of
Education. The HIV/Aids programme is a three-year programme, which
commenced in the 2000-2001 financial year.

The main reason for the low spending in the 2000-2001 financial year is
that the transfer of these funds was only gazetted on 28 August 2000.
Therefore, this project could only commence late in 2000. However, during
the 2000-2001 financial year, project managers and financial administrative
officers were appointed in the provinces to manage the project. The
printing of learner material was undertaken and the materials distributed
to the provinces. [Interjections.]

During 2000-2001, 1 289 workshops were conducted for master trainers and
teachers; 803 master trainers were trained; 29 966 teachers were trained;
and 4 353 peer educators were trained. [Applause.] Given the above, we are
satisfied as the ANC that the department is dealing urgently and
purposefully with the HIV/Aids emergency in and through the education and
training system. We call on all our parents to support these initiatives as
necessary interventions for the future of our children.

As we build a caring and people-centred society, I feel strongly that we
owe it to the learners who, at the conference, reported abuse, ill-
treatment, discrimination and stigmatisation, to rid the education system
of heartless educators, school managers and officials who abuse our
children, and distort, misrepresent and undermine our policies and
transformation agenda. In protecting our children and defending our
democratic gains, we should deal with them like a dog deals with a bone, as
we used to say in the trade union movement, which Comrade Randall will
remember.

We also call on the Department of Education to investigate the alleged
victimisation of educators who have declared their HIV/Aids status, such as
Ms Sibongile Mkhize, an educator allegedly dismissed by a school manager in
Wartburg, KwaZulu-Natal. There should be no room in the Public Service for
those who are not committed to serving our people with honesty, loyalty,
commitment, dedication and compassion.

School governing bodies, school managers, parents, educators and learners
should, as part of their contribution to building a people-centred and
caring society, expose perpetrators of these ghastly acts. We call on
educators in our schools to identify vulnerable children, to assist
Government in establishing a database, and to co-ordinate support and care
for children affected by and infected with the disease.

As part of Letsema, we wish to encourage schools to form support groups
with community outreach programmes for those affected and infected with
HIV/Aids. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, the previous speaker made a telling point
when he said that education was the great liberator.

I thank the hon the Minister for this pen, which I found in the Vote
package. I am always short of pens because I am computer illiterate, but I
plan to join adult basic education and training as soon as possible.

Edmund Burke said: ``Education is the cheap defence of nations.''
Therefore, the R7,9 billion earmarked in the Budget for the national
Department of Education will be money well spent. As much as 90% of the
department's budget will be spent on higher education, and I will follow
the same pattern in my speech.

The three teachers' trade unions recently gave the Minister of Education an
overall ``E'' on his report card. Perhaps they were a bit too harsh on the
hon the Minister. Reforming the country's education system within a short
period of time is a mammoth task. Because of the hon the Minister's sheer
determination to make a difference - and yes, indeed, he did make a
difference - he should get an ``A''. But when it comes to the language
policy of universities, where a new form of Milnerism is apparently
hovering, I am afraid the Minister will not pass. I will come back to this
point later on.

It seems as if the current system of differentiation in secondary schools,
namely higher and standard grades, is causing many problems. The system is
mostly misused by schools when they force learners into standard grade in
order to attain a 100% pass rate in matric.

Citadel chairman Louis Fourie said that if only 7% of matriculants find
jobs in the formal sector, the fault does not lie with the economy, but
with the quality of people created for that economy. And this is borne out
by the fact that in 2001 only 7,8% of matriculants wrote mathematics higher
grade and only 9,4% wrote accounting higher grade. Although the hon the
Minister indicated in a reply to a question in Parliament that he had no
intention of doing away with the standard grade course in secondary
schools, it would be worthwhile to reconsider the matter.

The uneven distribution of qualified teachers countrywide is a serious
matter and should be addressed urgently. However, we do not believe that
the proposed amendment to the Employment of Educators Act is the answer to
the problem. This amendment transfers the governing body's power of
appointment with regard to first applicants to the various education
departments. Parental involvement through governing bodies is an important
requirement for successful school management and should not be tampered
with.

There are other methods of ensuring a more equitable distribution of
qualified teachers. For example, an agreement should be reached with
learners that learners will study free of charge in exchange for required
service delivery wherever needed, equal to the years spent studying.
When the hon the Minister unveiled his plan for higher education, he said:
``If apartheid's engineer Hendrik Vervoerd knew how the tertiary education
landscape was about to change, he would not just be turning in his grave,
he would also be doing somersaults''. The ``turning in the grave'' part I
understand, but the ``somersault'' part I do not understand, because one
usually dos a somersault when one is elated about something, as Breyton
Paulse does when he has scored a try in a test match. The only thing that
Dr Verwoerd could be happy about - and I am also happy about it - is the
fact that Fort Hare, which obtained full university status during the
apartheid era, still maintains its autonomy in terms of the newly announced
plan.

The New NP welcomes the Cabinet's recommendation that the number of higher
education institutions be reduced from 36 to 21. A country with 42 million
people cannot afford 36 higher education institutions. Keeping Fort Hare
and the University of the Western Cape as autonomous institutions is a wise
step and reconfirms the principle that there is a place for universities
with an own institutional character.

Robert Sobukwe's vision that Fort Hare should be for the African what
Stellenbosch is for the Afrikaner can now be accomplished. I therefore
cannot agree with Prof Badat, Chief Director of the Council on Higher
Education, when he writes in the Sunday Times, and I quote:


  We must also avoid claims to safeguarding institutional traditions and
  culture as if these are frozen conditions.

As is the case with Fort Hare, I believe that there should be room for
universities with an own institutional character. A university is much more
than a mere technical institute for occupational training. There is an
intimate bond between a university and the specific community it serves,
which in turn will determine the institutional character of that
university.

In this regard I have a question for the hon the Minister. The management
of the Potchefstroom University decided to retain the word ``Christian'' in
the name of the university. Will the Minister, consequently, allow them to
do so by approving the statute of the university, which is now his
responsibility?

The three months set aside for comments should be utilised by the special
unit which will oversee the mergers, and get the support and co-operation
of institutions affected by mergers. The whole process will be still born
if there is no proper consultation, and I think the Unisa debacle
emphasises the need for consultation amongst the parties concerned.

Mergers cannot happen overnight, and the five-year phase-in period is to be
welcomed. This period should be used by all higher education institutions
to create a culture of academic co-operation in order to avoid unnecessary
duplication of scarce resources.

Perhaps voluntary co-operation should have preceded formal mergers, as is
the case in Taiwan. Eight of the island's most prestigious national
universities have announced their decision to band together and form two
university systems. The universities involved will maintain their
independent status, their names and own organisational and administrative
structures, whilst promising to share academic and physical resources in
areas such as biotechnology, medicine and social sciences. Perhaps this
route could also have been followed in South Africa or should be followed
before the official mergers.

Allow me also to register my concern about the proposed mergers between
universities and technikons. Nowhere in the world have such diverse
institutions been merged before and it may be worthwhile to take note of
presentations in this regard in the coming weeks.

I am now going to switch over to Afrikaans.

'n Mens sou verwag dat die aanbeveling van die Gerwel komitee 'n rol sou
speel in die Minister se finale aanbeveling oor die moontlike samesmelting
van universiteite. Trouens, in antwoord op 'n vraag in dié verband vroeër
vanjaar het die agb Minister aangedui dat dit wel die geval sou wees. Nou
lyk dit of dit nie gaan gebeur nie. Ek wil weer vra: wanneer gaan die agb
Minister die aanbevelings van die Gerwel-komitee bekend maak?

Dit sal ook goed wees as die agb Minister die Huis inlig oor presies wat sy
taalbeleid vir hoër opvoedkundige inrigtings is. Die Minister het ook
vroeër in die Parlement aangedui dat hy dit moontlik gaan oorweeg om ...
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[One would have expected the recommendation of the Gerwel committee to play
a role in the Minister's final recommendation on the possible merger of
universities. As a matter of fact, in reply to a question in this regard
earlier this year the hon the Minister indicated that this would indeed be
the case. Now it would appear that this is not going to happen. I want to
ask once again: when is the hon the Minister going to release the
recommendations of the Gerwel committee?

It would also be a good idea for the hon the Minister to inform the House
precisely what his language policy for higher education institutions is.
The Minister also indicated earlier on in Parliament that he may consider
...]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, can I do it now?

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, I would really appreciate it if he would
reply to this very important issue. I hope I will get injury time.
[Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Are you injured? [Laughter.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, not yet.

Die Minister het ook vroeër aangedui dat hy bepaalde universiteite
verantwoordelik gaan maak om spesifieke landstale te bevorder as akademiese
tale. Ons steun dit, want gelykberegtiging van alle landstale is 'n
grondwetlike reg. Al 11 landstale moet uiteindelik ontwikkel tot akademiese
tale.

Wat ons veral van die Minister wil weet, is wat die posisie van Afrikaans
in die nuwe universitêre landskap gaan wees binne die konteks van
gelykberegtiging van landstale. Uit die kabinet se aanbevelings oor die
samesmelting van universiteite blyk dit dat die histories Afrikaanse
universiteite almal tot tweetaligheid gedwing gaan word, selfs op
voorgraadse vlak, met die gevaar dat Engels Afrikaans uit daardie
universiteite gaan verplaas weens praktiese redes.

Ons weet dat vyf Afrikaanse universiteite te veel is, maar tog regverdig
die studentegetalle van Afrikaanssprekendes dat daar ten minste twee
universiteite sal wees wat die opdrag het om Afrikaans as akademiese taal
te ontwikkel. Dit is die enigste ander taal naas Engels wat reeds die
status van wetenskapstaal bereik het. Hierdie status moet aan die vyf
histories Afrikaanse universiteite wetlik beskerm word. Taal mag nooit as
'n rookskerm gebruik word om studente doelbewus om ander redes uit te sluit
nie.

Aan die Universiteit van Stellenbosch, wat Afrikaans as onderrigtaal in sy
instituut verskans het, word nie-Afrikaanssprekende studente effektief
geakkommodeer, sonder om die status van Afrikaans as onderrigtaal aan te
tas. Dit sou verkeerd wees om alle hoër opvoedkundige instellings sonder
meer te verengels.

Die agb Minister het vroeër in sy toespraak gesê: ``We are not penalising
Afrikaans medium institutions.'' Maar ongelukkig word Afrikaanse
universiteite benadeel wanneer hulle teen hoë koste gedwing word tot
tweetaligheid, terwyl histories Engelstalige universiteite nie
tweetaligheid hoef toe te pas nie.

Of die Nuwe NP die begrotingspos vir onderwys sal steun of nie sal afhang
van die Minister se antwoord op hierdie vraag wat hy netnou al wou
beantwoord. Ek hoop sy antwoord is positief. [Applous.] (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[The Minister also indicated earlier on that he was going to make specific
universities responsible for promoting specific official languages as
academic languages. We support that, because the equal treatment of all
official languages is a constitutional right. All 11 official languages
must ultimately develop into academic languages.

What we would specifically like to know from the Minister is what the
position of Afrikaans is going to be in the new university set-up within
the context of treatment of the official languages? Judging by the
Cabinet's recommendations on the merger of universities it would appear
that the historically Afrikaans universities are all going to be forced
into bilingualism, even at undergraduate level, with the danger that
English will replace Afrikaans at those universities for practical reasons.


We know that five Afrikaans universities are too many, but the number of
Afrikaans-speaking students nevertheless justifies the existence of at
least two universities, which have been entrusted with developing Arikaans
as an academic language. It is the only language other than English that
has already achieved the status of a scientific language. This status must
be protected by law at the five historically Afrikaans universities.
Language may never be used as a smokescreen deliberately to exclude
students for other reasons.

At the University of Stellenbosch, which has entrenched Afrikaans as its
language of instruction, non-Afrikaans-speaking students are being
effectively accommodated, without assailing the status of Afrikaans as the
language of instruction. It would be wrong simply to Anglicise all higher
education institutions.

The hon the Minister said earlier on in his speech: ``We are not penalising
Afrikaans-medium institutions.'' But unfortunately Afrikaans universities
are being adversely affected when they are forced into bilingualism at
great expense, while historically English universities need not introduce
bilingualism.

Whether or not the New NP is going to support the Education Vote will
depend on the Minister's reply to this question which he wanted to answer a
while ago. I hope his reply will be positive. [Applause.]]

Nk P N MNANDI: Somlomo, boNgqongqoshe abahloniphekile, malungu
ahloniphekile, othishela nabafundi, maqabane nezihlobo, kulowa nyaka
ngenkathi sidingida uhlelo lweSabiwomali ngathi: lube uphaphe esigqokweni
sakhe uNgqongqoshe uTrevor Manuel. Ngonyaka odlule ngithe uHulumeni oholwa
nguKhongolose, phansi kukaMongameli uThabo Mbeki, udodile. Kulo nyaka
ngithi uHulumeni oholwa nguKhongolose uzibhidlizile izindonga zobandlululo
kwimfundo ephakeme. Avulekile amasango. [Ihlombe.]

Namhlanje kuyakhanya bha kumphakathi wonkana waseNingizimu Afrika ukuthi lo
Hulumeni usahamba ezinyathelweni zawo uSomqulu weNkululeko, wona othi:
Amathuba okufunda kanye namasiko ayokuvuleleka kuwo wonke umuntu; UHulumeni
uyothuthukisa futhi akhuthaze amathalente akhona ukuze enze ngcono impucuko
yethu; Wonke umnotho wempucuko uyokutholwa ngabantu bonke; Inhloso yemfundo
kuyokuba ukufundisa intsha ukuthanda izwe layo, ithande abantu bakubo,
ithande amasiko ayo, ihloniphe ubudlelwano nenkululeko noxolo; Imfundo
iyoba yinye, ifane kubantu bonke; Ubandlululo ngokwebala ezintweni
zempucuko, emidlalweni nasemfundweni kuyoqedwa nya.

Uma ngiqeda ukucaphuna kuSomqulu weNkululeko, ngithanda ukungena ngqo
odabeni lweNyuvesi yaseNyakatho, eLimpompo. Kubafundi abangaphezu kwama-
800, kusuke abafundi abangevile kuma-200, abanye babo ababona nabafundi
kule nyuvesi, babhikisha befuna kukhishwe ngenkani imali engamarandi ayi-
300 000 yokuba kwenziwe indumezulu yegigi lokwamukela abafundi abasha.
Kuyacaca ukuthi iningi lale mali belizosetshenziswa ekuthengeni amanzi
amponjwana.

Okunye okunyanyisayo ukuthi bebebhikishela ukuthi emagumbini lapho kuhlala
khona abafundi kufuneka kube uthelawayeka kuwo - zonke nje zihlale
ndawonye. Kule nyuvesi kuke kwaba khona lokhu kuhlalisana ndawonye
ngaphambilini. Kodwa-ke kwaba nezinkinga zokuhlukunyezwa kwabafundi
besifazane, abanye babo baze badlwengulwa nokudlwengulwa. Kwaba khona
nokungaphephi kumantombazane. Kwavalwa-ke ngenxa yalezo zinkinga. Izingane
zethu ziyela ukuyofunda emanyuvesi, hhayi ukuya kokipita.

Kuyacaca-ke ukuthi likhona leli dlanzana elingafuni ukuthi le nyuvesi
iphathwe ngobuqotho. Bafuna nje kube kukampunzi edla emini. Kuyajabulisa
ukuzwa ukuthi iningi labafundi kule nyuvesi alihambisani nale midlwembe
ecekela phansi impahla ekhokhwa ngabakhokhi bentela. Thina,
singuKhongolose, siyahambisana nalokho okushiwo ngabaphathi benyuvesi
ukuthi: Labo ndlavini abangavunyelwa ukubeka imicondo yabo emagcekeni ale
nyuvesi. [Ihlombe.] Bonke abathintekayo ekucekelweni phansi kwempahla
mababoshwe. Abaholi bezinhlangano zabafundi nezentsha mabaphumele
eshashalazini, bazigxeke izenzo ezifana nalezi. Kubafundi bonke sithi: Uma
bevukwa ufuqufuqu, mabangacekeli phansi impahla. Mabaphuze amanzi.

Udaba lolimi luseyinkinga kwimfundo ephakeme ngoba zisekhona izikhungo
zemfundo ephakeme namhlanje ezisebenzisa ulimi njengesihibe esenza ukuthi
abanye abafundi abangalwazi lolo lwimi bangakwazi ukufunda kulezo zikhungo,
kumbe bahluleke nokuphumelela ezifundweni zabo. Ngonyaka odlule, kuthe
sihambele izikhungo zemfundo ephakeme safika kwenye inyuvesi okufundiswa
kuyo ngolimi lwesiBhunu nesiNgisi, uma besho. Emini, uma kufundiswa,
kufundwa ngesiBhunu sodwa bese kuthi uma selishonile ilanga, laba
abangasizwa isiBhunu bathole incazelo ngesiNgisi.

Okwangimangaza kakhulu ukuthi ngenkathi sixoxa nabafundisi balesi sikhungo,
babedamane bexolisa bethi abakwazi ukuyibeka kahle inkulumo yabo, ngoba
phela ulimi lukaJoji aluvuki kahle ngakubona. Ngazibuza ngaziphendula
ngathi: Hhabe! uma besho kanje kithina, kangakanani kumfundi ongasizwa
nhlobo isiBhunu?

Nansi-ke enye inselele esibhekene nayo: imfundo ephakeme yezilimi
zabomdabu. Iningi lezilimi zethu alifundiswa nokufundiswa emanyuvesi.
[Ihlombe.] Kulezo eziyingcosana ezifundiswayo, zifundiswa ngesiNgisi kanti
futhi zifundiswa ngabamhlophe abangenalo ulwazi ngemikhuba namasiko alaba
bantu abakhuluma lezi zilimi. Uye uthole ukuthi enyuvesi ethile umnyango
wesiZulu uphethwe umlungu omhlophe qwa okuthi uma ukhuluma naye
ngolukaPhunga noMageba, kuvele kudume upotiyane. Lokhu-ke kugcina
sekunemiphumela yokuthi abafundi badikibale, bagcine sebezigwema izifundo
zolimi lwabomdabu.

Iminyango yezilimi zabomdabu ayiphathwe ngabomdabu kumanyuvesi. Makwenziwe
ucwaningo olunzulu ngezilimi zakithi ngoba uma izilimi zethu
zingathuthukiswa kumazinga emfundo ephakeme, zizonyamalala bese sigcina
sesifana nse namaNgisi amnyama. [Ihlombe.]

Indaba-ke lena yokubaluleka kolimi ngiyibone kahle ngisenguthisha
ngifundisa isiNgisi kumatekuletsheni. Ngomunye unyaka ngahamba nami ngaya
ePitoli ngiyomaka amaphepha esiNgisi. Ngangimaka iphepha lokuqala.
Kwakunesihloko esasikhuluma ngezidakamizwa. Ngamaka iphepha lomfundi
owayebhale ngesihloko esithi ``The Shadow of the Chicken''. Mina-ke
angibanga nenkinga ngoba ngavele ngabona ukuthi phela lona ukhuluma
ngomthunzi wezinkukhu, insangu belu. [Uhleko.] Kwathi ukuba amaphepha ami
aye ku -moderator, kwasuka esinamathambo ethi yena lo mfundi akalifeyile
leli phepha ngoba ayikho into okuthiwa yi-shadow of the chicken
ngesiNgisi.[Uhleko.] Ngagcina ngalowo nyaka ukuyomaka ePitoli,
angiphindanga ngaya.

Ngabe ngenza iphutha uma ngingangabongi ukundlondlobala kwesikhwama
sokusiza abafundi kwimfundo ephakeme, esibizwa ngokuthi yi-NSFAS. Kulo
nyaka lesi sikhwama sinikezwe imali ... [Kwaphela isikhathi.] (Translation
of Zulu speech follows.)

[Ms P N MNANDI:  Madam Speaker, hon Ministers, hon members, teachers and
learners, comrades and relatives, the year before last, when we discussed
the budget, I said it was a feather in the cap of Minister Trevor Manuel.
Last year I said that the ANC-led Government, led by President Thabo Mbeki,
had done well. This year I am saying that the ANC-led Government has broken
down the walls of apartheid in tertiary education. Doors are now open.
[Applause.]

Today it is clear to all South Africans that this Government is
implementing the steps stipulated in the ANC Freedom Charter, which says:
Learning opportunities and cultures will be open to all people; the
Government will promote and develop existing skills so as to improve our
civilisation; economic civilisation will be achieved by all people; the aim
of education will be to teach the youth to love their country, their own
people, their own culture and to respect relationships, freedom and peace;
there will be one education which will be the same for all; racial
discrimination in matters of civilisation, sport and education will be
abolished.

In concluding the quotes from the Freedom Charter, I would like to discuss
the issue of the University of the North in Limpopo. Out of 800 students,
200, including students who are not registered at this university, embarked
on mass action, demanding that R300 000 be made available to them so that
they could throw a big welcoming party for new students. It is clear that a
large percentage of this sum of money was going to be used to buy alcohol.
Another disgusting thing that they were demanding was that their residences
should not be separated according to sex, they should be mixed. There was
this staying-together at this university before. But incidents of female
victimisation, including incidents of rape, were reported. Female students
felt very unsafe. This was then stopped because of these problems. Our
children go to university to study not to cohabit unlawfully.

It is clear that there is this group of people who do not want this
university to be administered properly. They want it to be a place where
everyone does whatever they wish. It is gratifying to hear that most
students are against these hooligans who are destroying the property that
was bought with taxpayers' money. We as the ANC agree with the university
management that these savages should not be allowed to set foot on
university premises. [Applause.] All those who were involved in the
destruction of property should be arrested. Leaders of youth and student
organisations should come forward and criticise this behaviour openly. We
would like to say to all students that if their evil energy gets the better
of them, they must not use it to destroy property. They should just drink
water.

The language issue is a problem at tertiary level because there are still
those institutions of higher learning, which use language to prevent
students who do not speak that language from entering those institutions or
from passing at those institutions. Last year when we visited institutions
of higher learning, we visited a university, which claimed that it used
both English and Afrikaans as mediums of instruction. During the day they
teach in Afrikaans and in the evening those who do not understand Afrikaans
get the English version.

What shocked me was that when we talked to the students at this university,
they always apologised saying they could not express themselves well
because they did not understand English well. I asked myself this question:
Hey! If they say this to us, how much more to a student who does not
understand Afrikaans?

Here is another challenge that we are facing: higher education in African
languages. Most of our languages are not even taught at university level.
[Applause.] Those few that are being taught are taught in English and
usually by white lecturers who do not have knowledge of the traditions and
cultures of the people who speak these languages. One finds that at a
certain university, the head of the department of African languages is a
white person who cannot understand one when one speaks Zulu to him. This
causes students to lose interest and end up avoiding studying African
language.

Departments of African languages at universities should be headed by
Africans. Thorough research should be done on our languages because if
African languages are not improved at tertiary level, they will disappear
and we will end up being like African English people. [Applause.]

I experienced the importance of languages first hand when I was a matric
teacher. I once went to Pretoria to mark English papers. I started marking
the first paper, which dealt with drugs. I marked the paper of a student
who wrote an essay entitled ``The Shadow of the Chicken''. I myself did not
have any problem with this because I knew that this student was talking
about dagga. [Laughter.] When my papers went to the moderator, he berated
me saying that the student had failed the paper because there was no such
thing as the shadow of the chicken in English. [Laughter.] That was the
last time I went to Pretoria to mark papers. I never went again.
I would be making a mistake if I did not express thanks for the development
of the fund that is aimed at helping students at tertiary institutions,
which is called NSFAS. This year this fund received a sum of ... [Time

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, on 16 May 2002 MEC Tolo
and I visited Letsatsing Science High School in Mafikeng, North West
province. This is part of the push by the Department of Education to
increase the enrolment of our youth at tertiary institutions by at least
200 000 in the next few years, and to ensure that the ratio of 40:30:30
relating to the arts, science and business-orientated studies at our
universities and technikons is achieved.

It is part of the drive to ensure that we succeed, as a country, in
developing a relevant and appropriate human resource base to serve us in a
fast-changing world. It is a recognition of the fact that, if we are to
succeed in all these endeavours, we must have millions of young, hot and
breathing bodies sitting behind desks in our classrooms all over our
country, successfully learning mathematics, science and technology-related
subjects.

Letsatsing Science High School is an ordinary state school to which
children from petty-bourgeois, working-class and peasant families go. But
it is also a school where everybody, the teachers, the learners and the
school governing body, do their bit. The school opens a week before other
schools at the beginning of the year on a voluntary basis, and both
teachers and students come to school on Saturdays and during school
vacations.

In May each year they finish the Grade 12 syllabus and they engage in
revision and self-enrichment in all subjects. The teachers are motivated,
dedicated and loving, while the children are happy, confident and know
exactly where they are going. Perhaps they all take after the Minister of
Education, Prof Kader Asmal, whose energy and drive at the head of this
Ministry sometimes leave many of us gasping for breath.

It is a joy to be in their midst and a confirmation of the fact that we can
succeed in producing learners from our schools who can proceed to tertiary
institutions sufficiently prepared to tackle their studies in the sciences
and business-orientated  disciplines. This also tells us that there are
wonderful teachers in our system who deserve our love and support. We
should spare a thought for them when media headlines scream dishonourable
things about some in the teaching profession.

These good teachers are not to be found only in the 102 schools but they
are to be found throughout the system. Let us therefore heed the words of
Jacques Barzun when he says, and I quote:


  Teaching is not a lost art, but the regard for it is a lost tradition.

These great teachers are indeed an asset to us in our endeavour to
inculcate and nurture a strong love for mathematics, science and technology
in our youth.

Madam Speaker, if Hip2b2 does not mean anything to you and me, it is
because it was not meant for our appeal or fancy. Thanks to the ``First
African in Space'' project, we had a way to communicate audibly. One of the
major challenges we face today is to ensure that our education system
encourages more and more learners to take up and succeed in the gateway
subjects of mathematics, science and technology.
The partnership we have had with Mark Shuttleworth in the past few months
has opened fresh insights and given us more cool ways of reaching out to
the youth. It is only through innovative and original ways that talk
directly to the youth that we can hope to sustain our gains and multiply
the yields of our efforts. We wish to take this opportunity to interest
members in the initiative in which the Department of Education is engaged
in an attempt to leapfrog to the level of technological sophistication that
characterises the global village.

In September 2000 the Minister of Education and the Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology addressed a conference that resolved to
focus the strategy for science, mathematics and technology education on
three thrusts, namely to raise the participation and performance of
historically disadvantaged learners in senior certificate science and
mathematics; to provide high-quality science, mathematics and technology
education to all learners taking the first FETC and GETC; and to increase
and improve the human resource capacity to develop quality science,
mathematics and technology education.

Cognisant of the effects of the technological advancements and the digital
divide that widens the gap between the haves and the have-nots, and
responding to the President's call in his opening address to  Parliament in
2000 and 2001, the Department of Education has initiated, amongst other
things, two critical mathematics, science and technology projects, namely a
reskilling and upgrading project for teachers in the intermediate and
senior phases, as well as Dinaledi, a mathemathics, science and technology
project that reaches out to 102 senior secondary schools. The two projects
are part of a roll-out of the strategy we launched in June 2001, a strategy
whose motto is ``Creating tomorrow's stars today''.

The Dinaledi of tomorrow are indeed the innocent youth who spend no less
than six hours a day in our schools. They are the children of Letsatsing
Science High School in Mafikeng, the wonderful girls of Motse Maria Girls
High School at Gamashashane, KwaMgaga High School in Umlazi, Beacon High
School in Phutaditjaba, Soa Ramakgakgalala High School in Gobokwane,
Kasselsvlei Comprehensive School in Bellville, Monwabisi High School in De
Aar, Residentia High School in Sebokeng, Sandy High School in Umtata, and
thousands of other schools all over our country.
The reskilling and upgrading project for intermediate and senior phase
teachers is a two-year programme that started with an intake of 1 350
teachers at the beginning of 2001. These teachers are registered with
higher education institutions across the country. At the end of two years,
they will emerge with an Advanced Certificate in Education or a National
Diploma in Education, depending on their qualifications when they joined
the programme. On completion, these teachers are also provided with
mathematics and science kits as part of our commitment to providing schools
with the resources they need for effective teaching. At the end of this
year, approximately 2 700 teachers will have been trained.

The Dinaledi project, on the other hand, focuses on one or two schools.
Amongst the targets that these schools have to achieve in the current year
is an increase in the number of learners that enrol for mathematics and
science at the higher grade. Our analysis has shown that, whereas the
overall participation rate in mathematics and science has remained steady
over the years, the number of learners registering for this subject on the
higher grade has been decreasing. This has been accompanied by a marked
increase in learners registering for these subjects on the standard grade.
Against all expectations, however, the pass percentage remains lower on the
standard grade than on the higher grade by an average of between 1% and 3%.

The increase in the participation rate of learners in general and girl
children in particular has become our first target. This has been
accompanied by teacher development programmes, infrastructural support
programmes, learning support materials provisioning, and school management
development. All these are attempts at improving the quality of life and
the experiences of children in our schools, and to ensure that we keep pace
with worldwide developments.

One of the major milestones of the first year of the Dinaledi project was
the Autumn Clinic that was held at the Eskom Convention Centre in April of
this year. The main objective of this exercise was to build up confidence
among the educators, particularly those who were not comfortable with the
offering of higher grade mathematics and science. It was also an
opportunity to pay tribute to Dinaledi teachers for the role that they play
in making their schools functional and successful centres of excellence.
Principals and teachers of mathematics and science from all the 102 schools
sacrificed their school holidays to attend the clinic. None was wearing a
long face. They were a happy bunch full of beans and oomph.

I have had the pleasure and privilege of visiting some of these 102 schools
in the past few weeks, Letsatsing Science High School being one of them.
During my visits, I came across many reasons to have my spirits raised
enough to be in a celebratory mood. I have been thrilled, for example, to
get reports of and see for myself evidence of schools that have maintained
a steady improvement curve that has brought most welcome changes. Most of
these schools are in the most humbling of surroundings, indeed.

The enthusiasm, in the eyes of both young and old, and the commitment to
excellence demonstrated by all is unequalled, and their focus and
purposefulness enviable. We need to increase the number of these schools
and thereby invest in our youth. In the process, we will kill this notion
that kids from our townships and villages are inevitable candidates for
bridging courses, remedial measures or intervention programmes at our
universities and technikons. All we need to do is to prepare them well
throughout their schoolyears. As we keep saying, there is absolutely
nothing wrong with our kids. If we create a suitable learning environment
for them, they will excel.

We must express the department's gratitude to the many social partners that
have joined us to alter, in a very fundamental way, the material conditions
of our people. Included in this list is the Mark Shuttleworth Foundation
for the management and financial support that it has given us; Multichoice
for the satellite dishes donated to each of the 102 schools; Sasol for the
mathematics and science books; and US Aid for the science kits donated to
all our schools. These and all other supporters, including Tantana,
continue to help us make the dreams of many of our children come true in
the true spirit of Tirisano.

Our children cry out for quality education in a conducive and safe
environment. This is surely not much to ask for, and the Ministry of
Education is determined to make this a reality for them. Since 2000, we
have worked in a focused way to make all our public institutions
functional, safe and high quality learning centres. We started dealing with
the more visible indicators of dysfunctionality by bringing back a culture
of discipline into our schools. We have worked to ensure that there are
firm and enforceable policies in all our schools regarding tardiness,
absenteeism and appropriate classroom behaviour for both teachers and
learners.

We are proud to say that, increasingly, our schools are showing the
necessary discipline and there is no doubt that in the majority of our
schools, teachers and teaching and learning are at the centre. We have also
worked hard to develop systems and practices to make these three principles
an integral part of how the education system functions. To realise this, we
have, since the beginning of this year, intensified our work in 16
education districts across the country. These districts are part of the
nodal areas identified by the President within the Urban Renewal and Rural
Sustainable Development Programmes. Through this initiative, we will be
working with over a million learners in 2 300 schools. We are determined
that, by the end of 2004, we will be assured of effective leadership, a
capable and positive teaching force, effective support from the district
offices and support for learners in all their needs in those schools.

Prince Charles is reputed to have said: ``I learn the way a monkey learns -
watching its parents''. If the British monarch had been to school at all,
he would have expressed himself differently. [Laughter.] In this country,
we are fortunate to have a lot of good teachers our children can watch and
learn from. [Applause.]

Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA: Madam Speaker, hon Minister - it looks like he is not
here at the moment - hon members, allow me to begin my speech by reading a
few clauses from the ANC bible - the Freedom Charter. These clauses were
prophesied by our own political prophets: James Phillips, Yusuf Cachalia,
Dr Moroka, Gandhi, Chief Luthuli, Rev Thansi, Dr Moleme and others. I would
like to quote a verse from chapter 7, which reads as follows:


  The doors of learning and culture shall be opened!
  The government shall discover, develop and encourage national talent for
  the enhancement of our cultural life;


  All the cultural treasures of mankind shall be open to all, by free
  exchange of books, ideas and contact with other lands;


  The aim of education shall be to teach the youth to love their people and
  their culture, to honour human brotherhood, liberty and peace;


  Education shall be free, compulsory, universal and equal for all ...

[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA: Madam Speaker, I am talking about the Freedom Charter.

Waar was daardie lid in 1955 toe die mense van Suid-Afrika hierdie
Vryheidsmanifes aanvaar het? [Where was that member in 1955 when the people
of South Africa adopted this Freedom Charter?] [Applause.]

Was education free in their apartheid days?

Ngifuna kukubeka kucace kahle hle kutsi ngesikhatsi selubandlululo,

of Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[I want to state clearly that during the apartheid regime, while I was
still at school, I never had the opportunity to get a proper education,
which is available now. With regard to biology, it meant that we were
learning about fish, crabs, and frogs, only useless things. What can I
actually do with knowledge of fish as I am standing here? Nothing.

When we, the ANC, took over the reins in 1994, it was only then that we
could look back to the Freedom Charter, to see what those people who were
living in 1955 said about the time that has now dawned. It was prophesied
that we were in fact going to receive our long desired independence. Now
that we are living in it, what are we doing about it?

We are trying to reverse the false education that we received, as some hon
members who spoke before me have already said, and make it better. We are
particularly targeting maths and science, as the Deputy Minster has said.

During our time, when we were still at school, it was said that maths and
science could only be studied by the rich and intelligent. We as the ANC
are trying to eradicate the notion  that maths and science are only for
intellectuals. Now, the challenge is that of the learners themselves,
because the ANC has opened up opportunities to all. So, boys and girls
should wake up and do it for themselves.

The 2001 matric results in maths and science were not very encouraging. The
overall registration was 4 000 black learners and 2 000 coloureds and
Indians, of whom only 3 128 passed. It was decided that this should be
examined at and discussed. A conference was held on 11 to 13 September at
Midrand in Johannesburg.

At that conference it was resolved that there should be another meeting at
which certain schools would be selected from the rural areas where schools
were forbidden to teach maths and science, so that they could also
participate in the competition that was agreed upon as a conference
resolution. It was also resolved that there would be a national strategy
for maths, science and technology education. That is where it was agreed
that it would be those schools that were disadvantaged and had absolutely
nothing to go by which would be selected, as I have already said.

Districts then selected those rural schools, district by district, as
follows: Eastern Cape 15; Free State 6; Gauteng 11; KwaZulu-Natal 23;
Mpumalanga 7; Northern Cape 4; Northern Province (Limpopo) 23; North West
7; Western Cape 6. The selected schools that entered the competition
numbered 102 in all.

I wish to give an example of the results of the resolution that was taken
at that Johannesburg conference: In the place where I live there is a
school known as Takheni Secondary School. That school came third in the
national awards amongst all the schools that entered the maths and science
competition. Next to it there is another school called Nganana High School.
In the previous year's results there was a learner, Mthokozisi Nkambule,
who got four distinctions, amongst which was maths and science. I am
talking about a rural school which has absolutely no equipment in its
laboratory. [Applause.]]

It became clear that we have a powerhouse. I would like to say to the hon
the Minister that we are challenging him to give us resources to generate
that powerhouse.

Loko-ke tsine lapha ka-ANC sikubita ngekutsi liLima/Letsima. Kunetinhlelo

follows.)

[That is what we, the ANC, call liLima/Letsima. There are programmes that
we have put in place, and right now winter schools are being planned, where
learners are going to meet and share knowledge. A school that is not well
equipped is going to be helped by one that is well equipped. Likewise, the
teachers are going to share knowledge and experience. That is where we say
one teaches another. I would like to inform the Minister that we are a
nation at work. Though the opposition might be making a noise, the Minister
must know that we are determined to ignore them and go forward.
[Interjections.]

In last year's Budget, R20 million was set aside for the National Student
Financial Aid Scheme, so that those who were employed to teach maths and
science, for which they were not trained, could be trained. We are now
taking them out of teaching to become skilled in teaching maths and science
so that we can get better results at the end of the year.]

Following on the President's state of the nation address, the Minister
requested that those provinces which find themselves in critical situations
where children learn under trees, should eliminate that situation in the
shortest possible time. Also, with the launch of the Schools Register of
Needs for 2002, the Minister urged the provincial MECs to submit the
business plans of their departments for infrastructure delivery over the
next three years. The business plans should have included quantified
targets to eliminate the classroom backlogs, and water and sanitation
backlogs.

Ngingati-ke nome umhlonishwa Gibson uyangiva yini ngobe ngambona nga-

Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[I doubt whether the hon Gibson is listening to me, because I also saw him
in January when we were engaged in the programme of visiting schools. I had
high hopes that as the hon member was there he was also going to take a
brush and do some painting, but I had deceived myself. In the twinkling of
an eye, I saw him disappearing into some toilets, where he just pointed
with a finger at those that were dilapidated. Now, I want to ask him
whether he has ever gone back to those schools to help them or was he just
showing off to gain some cheap political votes? [Applause.]

To this day that school is still in dire need, though the hon member was
standing there pointing at toilets which were not in order! We know that
there are schools that are without toilets. [Interjections.] That is also
what we inherited from them; they are the ones who deemed it fit that a
black child should be taught under a tree. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker, a fundamental move that was effectively made
by the ruling party, and one that the party deserves due credit for, was
the eradication of the abhorrent apartheid system of education from the
statutes. History will one day record that the destruction of that system
was vital for the restoration of South African society.

However, the realisation that we all have to work at building an equitable
replacement for the key elements of racial discrimination has not, as yet,
dawned on all of us. Highlighting that which is base and deplorable is one
thing; establishing that which is noble and just calls for serious
collective commitment.

The UDM wishes the Minister well in his vigorous efforts. He has hurled
abuse, though, at one of our colleagues for having moved a motion that did
not satisfy him. But, strangely enough, when one of his colleagues later
spoke in the very same vein in this debate, he applauded. He got us a
little confused about that.

I want to say that the party will accelerate the process of reconstruction
when it assumes control. It will put into action many of the things that
the Minister so eruditely vocalised. One shift that can be expected in that
case is one that involves a transfer in thinking from the scaler to the
victor. As much as speed differs from velocity and distance from
displacement, it is equally true that change does not constitute
transformation. That is where we would place the emphasis. Change can be
effected from the top down. Transformation, on the other hand, can most
effectively and most expeditiously be brought about when the people at
large accept and buy into the concept.

The hon the Minister's nimble pianist fingers have pressed on several key
matters in education in his brief spell as political head of education.
They produced a sound note when he identified a dearth of black people,
particularly coloureds and Africans, who leave school skilled at maths and
science. I am happy for the support my party leader has received from him
in addressing this weakness in the trouble-torn Eastern Cape.

The 102 schools project is a major attempt to create an interest in the
sciences on a national scale. It is sincerely hoped that this programme
will yield worthwhile results. A special plea is made to the Minister to
make a valuable investment in the longer term as well. For this one has to
look at the lower grades. It is commonly known that it is in the lower
grades that the essential foundations are laid for studying the sciences.
It is at that very time in a scholar's life that either a love of or a
lasting aversion to such subjects is inculcated. Perhaps for a few years at
least, the best educators we have should be attracted to nurture these
subjects in the lower grades.

I would urge the Minister and the very capable director-general of the
department, Mr Thami Mseleku, to note the fact that some school principals
have become so taken up with their role as business managers that there is
no space in their vocabulary for humanity. Complaints have reached me that
besides admission problems, there are particular schools, especially in
Mitchells Plain and in Gauteng, where pupils and their parents are being
intimidated and humiliated for school fees, even in cases where the
breadwinner has become unemployed. Children are called out in front of the
class and threatened that unless they speak to their parents to come and
pay their fees, they will not be allowed to write their exams. In this way
they are humiliated in front of their peers. I am not asking the Minister
to step in himself, but he should influence his MECs in whatever way he can
to take charge of this problem in the provinces.

The amendments to the restructuring plan for higher education institutions
were received earlier this week with some measure of relief. Of particular
note is the scrapping of the earlier intention to merge UWC and Pentech.
The revised plan for higher education in the Western Cape makes more sense
and has a greater chance to succeed. The recognition of the unique
character of UWC, and the role it has to play as a flagship university, is
noted. However, we do have reservations about the restructuring plan for
the very expensive dentistry faculty, largely because of its intended
removal from the large Tygerberg Hospital.

It is, however, regarded as vastly more important that each of the 11
universities, six technikons and four comprehensives will have to declare
their particular targets for integration over the next few years and that
access to these institutions must not be denied on the pretext of academic
or administrative standards or language. The time is long overdue for all
of these institutions to follow the lead of UWC and become racially
integrated. Whether the Minister likes it or not, the UDM supports his
budget. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers, members, the director-general
of the Department of Education and staff, the vision of the Minister of
Education and his department is a commendable one. I quote:


  ... a South Africa in which all our people have access to lifelong
  education and training opportunities, which will in turn contribute
  towards improving the quality of life and building a peaceful, prosperous
  and democratic society.

I doubt if there is any member of this House who would not support such a
vision.
Noah Webster in his original American Dictionary of the English Language
speaks about four minimal goals of education. He says, and I quote:


  Education comprehends all that series of instruction and discipline which
  is intended to enlighten the understanding, correct the temper, form the
  manners and habits of our youth, and fit them with usefulness in their
  future stations.

We regret the recent mass action taken by Cosas where, in the name of
improving the quality of their own education, they defied law and order,
robbed and looted the poor by stealing from street vendors who could least
afford this, and indiscriminately smashed the windows of motor vehicles. In
this day and age there is no need for this kind of destructive behaviour by
our youth. We have a democratically elected Government with sufficient
channels to address grievances. Criminal activity by learners must not be
tolerated at all. Perpetrators of violence must be brought to book.

The President said, and it was mentioned today, that no child should learn
under a tree. I would also like to add that no child should learn in a
classroom that is so damaged that it becomes a hazard to the learner's
health. I refer to classrooms where there are no windows, no floor boards,
and no decent staff rooms. Here I do not wish to lay the blame on the
Minister but at the door of provincial education department heads who fail
to give sufficient attention to the improvement of school buildings.

In conclusion, learners not only learn from what we teach, but also from
the examples we set. The ACDP supports this Vote.

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, in May this year I had the privilege to
officially visit different European countries. The Commissioner for
Education and Culture of the European Union is Mrs Viviane Reding. She
believes in cultural pluralism and her real passion is languages. She
defends minority languages and argues that there should be no big or small
languages in Europe, only mother tongues.

In February this year, 59 members of the pro Kurdish Peoples Party were
arrested in Istanbul. The reason was that they took part in a protest in
which they asked that the Kurdish language be used as the language of
instruction in certain universities in Turkey. Why is this a sensitive
matter? It is sensitive because Turkey aspires to become part of the
European Union and the EU has very strict guidelines for the cultural
rights of minorities, including the right to have mother tongue education
at all levels, up to tertiary level.

Coming to South Africa, when I test this Government's education policy, I
am afraid they will not pass the international guidelines, as I experienced
it there, for minority language and cultural rights. The question is: how
serious are we about section 6(2) of the Constitution, which states that
the state must take practical and positive measures to elevate the status
and advance the use of indigenous languages. My question then would be: is
IsiZulu a backward language? Will IsiXhosa never become a university
language?

In our memorandum to the Gerwel Commission, we proposed that specific
universities be made responsible for the development of the country's other
official languages up to university level. The FF did not react to the
Minister's proposal for the consolidation of universities and technikons
because the Minister indicated that the Gerwel proposals would be discussed
later. But the more I study these proposals and listen to the Minister, as
I did also today, the more I come to the conclusion that the Gerwel
proposals were postponed because they do not fit in with the Minister's
transformation agenda.

I want to quote from yesterday's Cape Times which the Minister might have
seen. They reported on his briefing of the Portfolio Committee on Education
in Parliament. The headline reads ``Asmal takes swipe at Maties''. The
report quotes the Minister as stating that language will not be allowed as
a barrier for access, particularly at Afrikaans institutions. My question
is: why particularly at Afrikaans institutions? Maties is in the Western
Cape where 60% of the population speak Afrikaans. The majority of this 60%
did their secondary education in Afrikaans. Why is English not a barrier
for access for these students at the University of Cape Town? If the
Government's policy is dual-medium teaching, will the Minister force UCT to
teach their courses in Afrikaans and English, since it is situated in the
Western Cape?

If the Minister will do this, then I will help him to force the
universities in KwaZulu-Natal to teach all their courses in English and
IsiZulu, and I will help him to force the University of Potchefstroom to
teach all its courses in Afrikaans and Setswana because it is situated in
the North West Province. That is fair, and in line with the Constitution
and the international principles of minority languages and cultural rights,
if we go this route of dual education.

Why is Afrikaans or IsiZulu a barrier for access, but not English? Is it
because the Minister believes there are superior and inferior languages? He
is saying no. Is it because one can only become a medical doctor by means
of English as the medium of instruction? That is nonsense! The Cuban
doctors that the ANC so proudly imported did their training through the
medium of Spanish and can hardly speak English. Are they bad doctors
because they were taught through the medium of Spanish?

Why is language and education such an emotional issue? It is because the
continued existence of an ethnic group or cultural group depends on the
extent to which the group succeeds in conveying their language and culture,
through education, to the children of that group. History shows that where
imperialists and colonialists wanted to assimilate or wipe out a cultural
group they tried to do so through education. In our history there is more
than one example.

One of the ANC's criticisms in this House against Dr Verwoerd is that he
used education as an instrument for social change and social manipulation.
I have listened carefully to the Minister and I can only come to one
conclusion: that the hon the Minister sees education in exactly the same
way as Dr Verwoerd - as an instrument for social manipulation and change.

The modern international approach to education is, for example, that
Parliament budgets an amount for education. Then it is calculated what
amount is spent on every individual child. The parents may decide to send
their children to a Muslim school, a Christian school or a Government
school. The amount of money budgeted goes with the child to his or her
school. This is democracy, this is freedom and it is the modern approach
away from governments trying to misuse education for social manipulation
and their own short-term political benefits.

The Minister is on record as being in favour of mother-tongue education.
Let us stick to this policy. I think it is the only way that is going to
solve our education policy problems in South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, hon members, the current appropriation of
the Department of Education places the department among the top five
departments to receive the highest allocations. This is an indication that
Government has education as a priority and that with the indefatigable
Minister there is hope. All Minister Asmal needs is support; he has the
passion.

We applaud the gradual phasing in of early childhood development in primary
schools. This ensures that learners are put into school at quite an early
age. It is regrettable, however, that most provincial education departments
that have allocations for early childhood development projects are unable
to sustain them over the medium term. It is equally important to note that
in one of the Minister's reports last year on the state of and access to
early childhood development in the provinces, it was reported that in the
North West some R22 million accumulated for early childhood development
needs during the Bophuthatswana days was lying idle. Money should not be
allowed to remain unused while there is a shortage of infrastructure.

Dynamite surely has to be used on Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and North
West for failing to spend the millions of rands allocated to them as
conditional grants for early childhood development. These provinces show no
seriousness in their business, which is the education of the children of
the nation. While the Minister has no control over the MECs for Education,
we maintain that he is best placed to prevail upon them to give a thought
to Africa.

The state of repair of some primary schools leaves much to be desired. The
Vezukhono Primary School on the East Rand is in a pitiable state. Children
cannot show and display their ability, as the name suggests, when they are
compelled to learn under deplorable conditions. We also hope the issue of
the school of shame in the Brits area is a thing of the past, as the
Minister said during the briefing to the portfolio committee.

Educators continue to experience problems in accessing their registration
certificates from the SA Council for Educators, to the extent that they
have to travel to Centurion at great cost to pick them up. Officers at SACE
have been on radio, admitting that they have problems in sending the
certificates and virtually appealing to educators to come and fetch them
from their offices.

When the hon the Minister took over as Minister of Education he came up
with the Tirisano principle and swore to break the back of illiteracy in
five years. We do not doubt his intention and resolve. We support him fully
in that, but we sympathise with him in that people who have to deliver are
not in tandem with him. Of all the nine provinces, only three have budgeted
more than 1% for adult basic education and training. This shows no
seriousness in eradicating illiteracy. What hurts again is that where
attempts are made, there is poor control in that division.

We call on all political masters in charge of education to keep pace with
housing development plans. Residential houses are mushrooming across the
landscape, but no schools are being built simultaneously with them. The
result is that young children have to commute for schooling, and those
whose parents are less endowed financially, walk long distances, thus
becoming vulnerable to abuse and exposure to the elements of crime and
truancy. We plead for better co-ordination among Government departments to
obviate this situation. The UCDP supports the Vote in any case. [Applause.]


Mr B M KOMPHELA: Madam Speaker, hon members ...

... terwyl ek daar gesit het, het die agb Pieter Mulder vir my gevra dat ek
hierdie toespraak vir die volk in Afrikaans lewer. En rêrig, ek het hom
belowe dat ek vir die volk sal sê hoe die lewe van die mense beter gaan
word as ons hier vandag die begroting aan die mense voorlê. Ek dink ek sal
vandag vir my kollega Pieter Mulder net kan sê dat ek rêrig om verskoning
vra by die volk omdat ek vandag net in Afrikaans praat, veral sodat Cassie
Aucamp my mooi kan hoor. [Gelag.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[... while I was sitting there the hon Pieter Mulder asked me to deliver
this speech to the nation in Afrikaans. And really, I promised him that I
would tell the nation how the lives of the people would improve when we
submitted the budget to the nation here today. I think I can only say to my
colleague Pieter Mulder today that I really apologise to the nation for
only speaking Afrikaans today, especially so that Cassie Aucamp can
understand me properly. [Laughter.]]

Our movement had to lead a struggle against very stubborn and repressive
white minority rule in our country. The ANC had to lead the masses of our
people to defeat the most naked racism ever experienced by our people in
this country. That system was called apartheid and was ruthlessly
implemented.

Today a white racist minority is the first to say apartheid is dead. But
somewhere in the corners one sees a shadow or a skeleton of apartheid
emerging. Apartheid is not totally dead. We need to make an effort to bury
this scourge of racism, which is not prepared to die.

We all know that education was a good instrument in the past. The ANC today
is engaged in a type of education that deepens democracy, builds the nation
and makes a better life for all our people. Today we pride ourselves on the
many achievements which were not obtained by anybody else in this country.

I would like to say to the hon the Minister that the surprise visits that
many hon members of the ANC have undertaken to some schools, after they
committed themselves to seeing to it that the very first day of the school
year became the first day where the nation was at work, have assisted in
calming down and bringing stability in various schools. I would like to
commend them and thank them for that job. [Applause.]

Many times, little is said about the commitment manifested by my colleagues
in ensuring that we all contribute equally. Education does not belong to
Prof Kader Asmal alone. It belongs to all of us. Some of my colleagues did
not go to schools during their reopening only, but continued visiting these
schools. Their presence all over the country has resulted in us getting it
right on the first day. I want to demonstrate this to members.

Let me share with this House some of the greatest achievements by the
Department of Education in this country. On that day, 95% of educators
attended. We wish to congratulate them and urge them to keep it up, as the
nation needs them. The 95% of learners who attended that day was very
remarkable, considering the history and the turbulence that we passed
through, but we managed to get it right.

I think educators and learners deserve our compliments and we say to them
that they should keep it up. Well done to educators and learners who have
proved many people wrong, people who said that education is in anarchy,
because it is not. Education is in the process of being corrected to make
it better. We attribute this to ``Vuk'uzenzele'' because nobody will wake
up and get it done except we ourselves.

We welcome the attention given to early childhood development. When other
people do not understand what is going on, I think it is better for them to
sit down and listen. We pride ourselves on the early childhood development
centres that have mushroomed throughout the country. The number of early
childhood development centres has increased. I do not know who has not done
that research and seen that we have put a tremendous effort into making
sure that early childhood development centres become vibrant and thrive.

Mosotho o re thuto ha e tsofallwe. [The Sotho say one is never too old to
learn.]
We have committed ourselves to helping people to read and write. The
programme of Abet is succeeding on a daily basis. Provinces have increased
the enrolment of learners and reduced the learner drop-out rate at Abet
centres. We need to acknowledge and appreciate that, because the percentage
of people who enrolled last year and this year has improved. We appreciate
the reduction in the drop-out rate.

While we increase enrolment, we must also improve the number of learners
who achieve a general education and training certificate. Something that we
want to know is: Have a number of those people benefited from Abet? Yes,
that is the case. And I think it is important for the Minister to give
people statistics, to show that Abet is helping people and that our parents
love the fact that they are now able to read and write, especially when
they are at the bank.

Despite all the difficulties, there has been an improvement in the
provision of education in this country. Yes, there are weaknesses here and
there, but they should not detract from the achievements and the gains that
we have made in this country. For example, in my constituency in the Free
State, the year started off on a very high note, and the nation is at work.
My province has taken part in the national well-performing school awards. I
can boastfully say that Grey College obtained the third position in the
whole country in the category of technology. [Applause.] That was a good
performance by that province.

Tsoseletso High School, in Mangaung township, obtained first position in
the whole country. [Applause.] And, it obtained that position by being a
school that has for more than seven years consistently excelled with a 98%
pass rate. Well done, Tsoseletso High. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, the debate on education again
offers us the annual review of progress made in education. This debate is a
mirror of the nation. Unfortunately, what we see in the mirror does not
look good. Perhaps this debate will offer some explanations.

Six years after Bantu education, we should have some tangible gains. Our
goal should remain free and compulsory education, not only up to matric,
but also up to the end of the first university degree.
This commonly stated maxim for a developing country, emerging out of
centuries of enforced backwardness, does not lend itself to easy debate.
The current demonstration by students, although unfortunate, even tragic,
paradoxically underscores the truth of this ideal. When people in this day
and age cry out ``we want education, but cannot afford it'', we have all
the elements of a classic Greek tragedy.

One other area of concern is motivation, which many pupils have or ought to
have. One factor which stimulates the interest of many pupils, is the
availability of jobs at the end of a school or tertiary education career.
The number of qualified graduates who are unemployed and roaming the
streets cannot be a source of inspiration for those who are still sweating
it out in classrooms, lecture rooms and libraries. Our school curricula
should be urgently reviewed to align them to the requirements of the work
market. Those who have already been pushed out of our sausage machine must
be re-educated and retrained. To ignore or blame them would be insensitive
and irresponsible.

The morale of the teaching fraternity is another critical factor in
assessing the success of an education programme. Some of our teachers have
lost a sense of vocation. The recent shocking case of teachers refusing to
subject themselves to inspection is a case in point. It does not matter
what fine-sounding arguments were advanced; the truth was obvious to all.
There is no hardworking teacher who would fear inspection of his work. In
fact, such a teacher would look forward to inspection and the resultant
affirmation of his work. The teachers who do not want inspection want to
cover up their laziness and irresponsibility, hiding behind rights and
privileges. Such teachers are a national liability, a disgrace to the noble
profession and must be weeded out. [Interjections.]

Education should be removed from the sphere of political conflict. We need
a broad national consensus, otherwise we will spend millions of rands on
useless undertakings instead of using the money for developing our valuable
national asset, our precious human resource potential. We should delineate
parameters of consensus on national policy and argue about style and
details of implementation.

This is clearly illustrated in the restructuring of higher education. The
major transformation and rationalisation of our higher education was
discussed with stakeholders, accepted, rejected, ignored, tolerated,
accepted again, etc in a litany of confusion. What seems to be clearly
indicated is that a speedy consensus, a national consensus, is needed. It
is very expensive to go through an exercise, then have it reversed and then
go through the exercise again!

This ritual dance is not funny, and costs an arm and a leg. We need one
major summit representing the Government, leaders of political parties,
principals of universities and technikons, leaders of student bodies and
other major stakeholders representing parents. A week after that summit
there must be implementation, and this will reduce the misinformation and
cut out fickleness and politicisation of the event.

Education demands that we put everything we have into it. It is in our
interest and in the interests of the nation. The PAC will support this
Vote.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, in our Constitution of 1996 we undertook to
make education accessible to all as a human right and not a privilege. The
harsh divisions of the apartheid regime had left our nation predominantly
illiterate, with education being provided according to race and colour.

These inequalities have been the central issue for reconstruction and
transformation in this department. The transformation of education in order
to achieve equality in education and education for all is strongly
supported by the MF.

We have seen the hon the Minister and his department hard at work, but
often getting a hammering from dissatisfied and concerned persons.
Nevertheless, their hard work, dedication and commitment to educating our
nation are evident, and criticism as a contribution to the betterment of
the Ministry is welcome.

It is partly for this reason that we firmly believe in transparency and
public participation, because we are a Government by the people, for the
people. Lately concerns and dissatisfaction have been expressed about the
hon the Minister's plans for higher education. However, the MF feels that
people should allow the broader picture to emerge before criticising it.

A media report dated 29 May 2002 stated that among the many changes planned
for higher education was a transformation process that would take about
four to five years. We note that the Minister will be earnestly involved
and that special units to oversee the process will be set up.

Secondly, increased responsibility will be transferred to groups largely
excluded up to now, such as the disabled and those in informal learning
institutions. This is especially pleasing to the MF.

Thirdly, the quality of higher education teaching will be boosted by means
of special incentives, and attention will be given to low academic
salaries. This the MF feels is long overdue.

Furthermore, South Africa requires that human resources in the fields of
science, and administration and information technology should be boosted by
60%. The MF is pleased with these proposed changes and hopes that these
suggestions will deliver the intended results.

In view of the budget allocated to the department and the programme and
projects aimed at the undertaking, the MF is assured of the department's
delivery. It is, however, crucial to ensure earnest consultation with all
parties concerned on this, as the satisfaction of our people is a priority.
Our main aim is to educate our nation, because an educated nation makes a
stronger nation. The MF supports this Vote. [Applause.]

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Madam Speaker, in his address on the occasion of
the 90th anniversary of the ANC on 8 January 2002, President Thabo Mbeki
called on the citizens of South Africa to take the lead in rendering
voluntary service to our people. In fact, there is a wonderful leading
article on this matter in the Tirisano News Bulletin, which is available at
the information stalls which the Department of Education has set up in
Parliament today, with a beautiful picture of the President handing out
textbooks on the first day of school this year.

All over South Africa our fathers and mothers, our community leaders and
our children have since then donned their work clothes, cleaning schools,
raking gardens, scrubbing hospital floors and beautifying old age homes.
The President has awakened in the South African nation a realisation that
if we want our country to work, we must get off our high horses and get
down to the business of literally dirtying our hands to build a better
country.

In his address to us here today, our Minister of Education has referred to
the values in the education component of our National Curriculum Statement,
through which we are attempting to build a common national identity,
national symbols, heritage and history. This component of values in
education is just as essential as our achievements in formal examinations.

However, the Minister also referred in his address to a number of schools
that have failed to embrace the values and symbols of our new democracy. I
would like to address some of the problems which I believe lie at the root
of this failure.

I am now switching to Afrikaans ...

... want ek wil hê die agb Aucamp en die agb Mulder moet my mooi hoor!
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Deur middel van ons uitkomsgebaseerde onderwysprogram van Kurrikulum 2005
is ons besig om 'n beter begrip by ons kinders te skep van wát hulle leer,
hoekóm hulle leer en wáárheen hulle op pad is. By wyse van Kurrikulum 2005
wil ons 'n begrip van en waardering vir die diversiteit van kulture,
godsdienste en tale by ons leerlinge skep wat eie is aan die reënboognasie
van Suid-Afrikaners. Ons strewe dus deur ons kurrikulum na die ontwikkeling
van kritiese en verantwoordelike burgers wat konstruktief kan deelneem aan
'n kultureel diverse en veranderende gemeenskap.

Daar is egter nog steeds 'n eng, rassistiese reaksie vanuit baie geledere
in die voormalig bevoordeelde blanke gemeenskap wat ons strewe na 'n nie-
rassige onderwysbestel in die wiele ry. Dit het byvoorbeeld al in die
platteland 'n gewoonte geword dat, sodra bruin en swart kinders hulle in
noemenswaardige getalle by voormalige model C-skole inskryf, daar 'n uittog
is van blanke leerlinge na naburige dorpe waar hulle hul in groot getalle
by eksklusiewe skole registreer.

Ek wil vir agb lede 'n paar voorbeelde uit my eie kiesafdeling in die Karoo
noem. Daar was 'n uittog van wit leerlinge uit Hoërskool Murraysburg na
meer eksklusiewe skole in Graaff-Reinet. Daar was 'n uittog van wit
leerlinge uit Hoërskool Laingsburg na meer eksklusiewe skole in Oudtshoorn.
So, is ek seker, is daar baie ander voorbeelde in ander dele van die land
waarop ander agb lede ons kan wys. Op ons plase gaan dit nog erger. Die agb
lid Komphela het reeds in sy toespraak daarna verwys.

Ek dink nie ek wil die getallekaart in hierdie sensitiewe kwessie van
skoolopvoeding speel nie; dit is te gevaarlik en dit sal ons brose
demokrasie skade aandoen. Ek weet ook dat dit nie die besluit van leerlinge
as sodanig is of hulle uit oorwegend gekleurde skole moet trek nie. Dit is
hulle ouers wat in die meeste gevalle daardie keuse uitoefen. Daardie ouers
is lede van bepaalde politieke partye, die VF en die DP in die besonder.

Daardie partye lê ongelukkig nie enige leierskap aan die dag ten opsigte
van 'n bydrae om te bou aan nie-rassige skole met 'n diversiteit van
kleure, kulture en tale nie. Dit is hierdie einste partye wat die aankweek
van nie-rassige waardes en kulture in hierdie Parlement teenstaan soos dit
vervat is in die Nasionale Kurrikulumverklaring, en so die twyfelagtige
voorbeeld stel van rasse-ekslusiwiteit en kultuurgeslotenheid. Kultuur is
nie staties nie; dit is dinamies, en Kurrikulum 2005 is die één geleentheid
wat ons opkomende geslag het om 'n kultuur van 'n demokratiese Suid-
Afrikaanse nasie te bou met wedersydse respek vir mekaar se kultuur,
godsdiens en taal. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[... because I want the hon Aucamp and the hon Mulder to hear me clearly!
[Interjections.]

By means of our outcomes-based education programme of Curriculum 2005 we
are creating a better understanding among our children of what they are
learning, why they are learning it and where they are heading. By way of
Curriculum 2005 we want to create an understanding of and appreciation for
the diversity of cultures, religions and languages on the part of our
learners which is peculiar to the rainbow nation of South Africa.
Therefore, through our curriculum, we are striving to develop critical and
responsible citizens who can participate constructively in a culturally
diverse and changing society.

There is, however, still a narrow-minded, racist reaction from within the
ranks of the previously advantaged white community that is putting a spoke
in the wheel of our pursuit of a nonracial educational dispensation. For
example, it has become the practice in rural areas that as soon as coloured
and black children enrol in significant numbers at what were previously
Model C schools, there is an exodus of white children to neighbouring towns
where they register in large numbers at exclusive schools.

I want to give hon members a few examples from my own constituency in the
Karoo. There was an exodus of white learners from Murraysburg High School
to more exclusive schools in Graaff-Reinet. There was an exodus of white
learners from Laingsburg High School to more exclusive schools in
Oudtshoorn. I am certain that there are many such examples in other parts
of the country that other hon members can point out to us. On our farms it
is even worse. The hon member Komphela has already referred to this in his
speech.

I do not think that I want to play the numbers card with regard to this
sensitive question of school education; it is too dangerous and it will
damage our delicate democracy. I also know that it is not the decision of
learners per se as to whether they should leave predominantly coloured
schools. It is their parents who in most instances exercise this choice.
Those parents are members of specific political parties, the FF and the DP
in particular.
Those parties, unfortunately, do not display any leadership with regard to
a contribution to building nonracial schools with a diversity of colours,
cultures and languages. It is these very same parties who oppose the
fostering of nonracial values and cultures in this Parliament as contained
in the National Curriculum Declaration, and thus set the questionable
example of racial exclusivity and cultural reservedness. Culture is not
static; it is dynamic, and Curriculum 2005 is the one opportunity our
future generation has to build a culture of a democratic South African
nation with mutual respect for one another's culture, religion and
language.]

The problem, unfortunately, in this House is that the official Opposition,
the DP, wants to be an opposition for the sake of opposition, and they want
to tell all and sundry that they are fighting the ANC because this is their
claim to fame. [Interjections.] In their fervour to demonstrate their
machismo, they lose entirely the opportunity to be part of the
reconstruction and development of a society devastated by the ravages of
apartheid. [Interjections.] So in spite of the many positive things he
said, the hon Ntuli was forced by his party-political hacks to be negative
as well in this debate. [Interjections.]

The hon Ntuli was present, for example, when the MEC from the Eastern Cape
addressed the Portfolio Committee on Education. He acknowledged in the
meeting that the province was doing well under very difficult
circumstances, but as soon as he gets to this podium, he gets onto the
Eastern-Cape-bashing bicycle of the DP. [Interjections.] This is
opportunist and it smacks of armchair criticism, while the MEC and the
department in that province have to deal with the reality of the delivery
of education on the ground.

Let me turn to schools with a 0% pass rate in Grade 12. This is rapidly
diminishing with every examination, but the DP is not even prepared to
acknowledge that. The whole school evaluation is still a young process.
[Interjections.] The hon Ntuli still sees that there is not much happening.
Obviously it is just starting, it is a young process. Mr Donald Lee must
still speak, but there are no surprises in store for us. [Interjections.]
He will be as negative as only the DP can be in a country basking in the
glow of democratic governance, redress and equity.

In the remaining time at my disposal, I want to reflect on the many
comments and remarks that have been made about the state of education in
the Eastern Cape. As I have indicated, the MEC for Education in the Eastern
Cape, the hon Stone Sizani, addressed the portfolio committee on the state
of education in that province. The MEC gave a very honest, no-holds-barred
account of the state of education in the Eastern Cape. And in listening to
the report given to us ...

Ms J A SEMPLE: That was shocking!

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: It was shocking, but the hon Ntuli agreed with us
in the meeting about the trying circumstances under which people ...
[Interjections.] She was not there!

Listening to the report given to us by the MEC and his directorate, we were
struck not only by the complexity of the situation in the Eastern Cape, but
also by the urgent and proactive attempts made by that provincial
department to improve the situation. [Interjections.] For example, the
Eastern Cape has the largest number of public schools in South Africa, 6
278 in total. The Eastern Cape also had to deal with the legacy of forming
a single provincial education department out of three Bantustan and three
tricameral education departments, each with enormous problems and
complexities of their own.

My time has expired, Madam Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I am glad you are aware of that.

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: However, I maintain that the province is doing its
utmost under trying circumstances. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, yesterday the funeral service of a famous South
African, Hansie Cronjé, was held. It was a ceremony that touched the heart
of every South African. What does this have to do with a debate on
education? Let me explain to hon members.

Hansie's wife and parents could have chosen any venue they liked, but they
decided on a school, Grey College in Bloemfontein, Hansie's alma mater. The
person who concluded the ceremony, with a word of thanks and appreciation,
was none other than Mr Johan Volsteedt, the headmaster. The guard of honour
consisted of the boys of the first rugby and cricket teams of Grey College,
and contained in the rolls of merit against the walls were the names of
Hansie, his father and his brother. Mr Volsteedt said: ``Hansie is all over
here, behind us, in front of us, and next to us'', and he pointed to
Hansie's South African jersey and cap against the wall. There could not be
a more appropriate place to bid farewell to a great man.

The above gives us a glimpse of what role an institution such as a school
can and must play in the lives of South Africans. It must be a centre of
excellence, a place near to one's heart, an inseparable part of one's life.
Yesterday I realised this again, and this is my plea to the Minister today:
let us build on what we have, let us strive to extend and expand this
excellence to all the peoples of our country, and let us stop scratching
where it is not itching. Let us embark on the road to improvement and
transformation with due respect for what we have inherited.

Let me mention a few examples. Earlier this year the Minister wrote a
letter to the Citizen newspaper about school uniforms. He said: ``This is
really a leftover from the colonial system, based on strict regimented
systems of schooling, much like an army.'' Does the Minister remember that?
It is our fear that there is, within the Ministry and the department,
antagonism towards and intolerance of the traditions and values of
substantial sectors of modern society in South Africa. If the Minister had
seen the guard of honour yesterday, he would think again. These were not
the Protea team-mates, but schoolboys in their uniform.

Let me refer to respect for tradition. Grey College is named after Sir
George Grey, a colonial governor. After Britain confiscated the then
Transgariep during the Battle of Boomplaats in 1848, the yoke of
colonialism was thrown off with the establishment of the Republic of the
Orange Free State in 1854, but up to today the name Grey College has stayed
intact, even in the heart of the most Afrikaans-speaking city in our
country. That is an example for us.

Let me turn to accessibility and nondiscrimination. Three of the 10 boys
who sang in the little choir yesterday were black, fully integrated in the
values and traditions of their new alma mater.

Waarom noem ek hierdie dinge? Omdat ons vandag 'n toenemende aanslag ervaar
op skole wat presteer. Noem maar op! HTS Louis Botha in Bloemfontein,
Hoërskool Ermelo, Hoër Landbouskool Bekker in Magaliesburg, almal
onderworpe aan vervolgingsaksies deur provinsiale departemente, en in elke
geval het die departement sleg tweede gekom met geen substansie nie.

Die onderwysdepartement van Gauteng het die Hoërskool FH Odendaal in
Pretoria probeer dwing om sy taalbeleid te verander. Die hof het egter hul
poging met koste verwerp en ouerseggenskap bevestig.

Die AEB doen 'n beroep op die Minister om liewer op te bou as om af te
breek. Transformasie mag nooit ontaard in deformasie nie. Ons beleef 'n
toenemende aanslag teen bestuursliggame. Kragtens voorgestelde nuwe
wetgewing wat binnekort ingedien word, verloor bestuursliggame hul
bevoegdheid om self nuwe personeel aan te stel en boonop moet die
departement dan 'n etiese kode opstel vir bestuursliggame. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

Why am I mentioning these things? Because today we are experiencing an
increasing onslaught on those schools that are performing. Just name them!
HTS Louis Botha in Bloemfontein, Ermelo High School, Bekker Agricultural
High School in Magaliesburg, all subject to legal proceedings instituted by
provincial departments, and in each case the department came off second
best and without substance.

The education department of Gauteng tried to force the FH Odendaal High
School in Pretoria to change its language policy. However, the court threw
out their attempt with costs, confirming parental say.

The AEB appeals to the Minister rather to try and build than to break down.
Transformation should never degenerate into deformation. We are
experiencing a growing onslaught against governing bodies. In terms of
proposed new legislation soon to be tabled, governing bodies will be
stripped of the power to appoint their own new staff, on top of which the
department will then have to draw up an ethical code for governing bodies.]

Governing bodies are affronted by the Ministry's proposal to treat school
governors, elected parents, adult educators and adult non-educators as if
they were children at a school and as if the head of the department was a
governor of school governors. This translates into treating democratically
elected school governors even less democratically than learners are
treated. The move is demonstrative of a disturbing mindset of antagonism
towards and contempt of school governing bodies, which has already
manifested itself in the past and is now more palpable than ever. There are
already sufficient provisions in place to deal with members of school
governing bodies who abuse their positions.

Ons weet daar bestaan massale probleme in talle ander skole. Ons weet daar
bestaan twee wêrelde in die onderwys in Suid-Afrika, maar dit is nie nodig
om die een af te breek ten einde die ander een op te bou nie.

Die AEB pleit vir differensiasie in die hantering van skole; dat 'n skool
deur prestasie 'n groter mate van selfstandigheid kan behaal; dat
presterende skole uit die ou bedeling nie as 'n bedreiging gesien moet word
nie, maar as 'n bron en sentrum vanwaar standaarde en uitnemendheid 'n
uitvoerproduk na ander instansies kan word; en dat meegewerk word, en
sentrifugale krag sal uitgaan na ander skole en gemeenskappe. Dit geld ook
vir universiteite. Die agb Mulder en Geldenhuys het daarna verwys en ek
gaan nie daarop uitbrei nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We know there are massive problems in many other schools. We know there
are two worlds in education in South Africa, but it is unnecessary to break
down the one in order to build up the other.

The AEB is appealing for differentiation in dealing with schools; that a
school may by way of performance attain a greater degree of independence;
that schools from the old dispensation which perform well should not be
seen as a threat, but as a source and centre from whence standards and
excellence may become an exportable commodity to other bodies; and that
there may be co-operation, with a centrifugal force extending to other
schools and communities. This also applies to universities. The hon Mulder
and Geldenhuys have referred to this and I am not going to elaborate on
it.]

That brings us to the matter of the religious ethos of a school. The AEB
had fruitful discussions with the Minister last year, and as a result the
Minister held a meeting with the education committee of churches from the
reformed family and was then invited to nominate a member of the Minister's
advisory council. Can the hon the Minister inform this House what progress
has been made in this regard?

Ek wil afsluit deur die volgende te sê. [I want to conclude by saying the
following.]

South Africans, across the board, acknowledge the need for and will be
devoted to an education system that takes the whole country forward. Give
them the security of respect and appreciation for what has already been
achieved, of what is dear to them, and they will embark with the Minister
on the long road of what still needs to be achieved, so that every school
in South Africa can eventually become a centre of excellence, tradition and
loyalty, as we witnessed yesterday when we said goodbye to Hansie.

Mnr T D LEE: Mev die Speaker, normaalweg as 'n ramp 'n gebied tref, word so
'n gebied deur die regering tot rampgebied verklaar. Ek kom van die Oos-
Kaap - en ek het opdrag van my kiesers gekry om hieroor te praat - waar die
staatsadministrasie in totale chaos gedompel is. In der waarheid,
administratief gesproke, is die Oos-Kaap 'n rampgebied wat astronomiese
afmetings aangeneem het. [Tussenwerpsels.] Om die Huis so 'n kykie in die
situasie daar te gee, wil ek graag die gebeure in die onderwys as voorbeeld
gebruik om bostaande stellings te ondersteun. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, normally when disaster strikes an area, such an
area is declared a disaster area by the Government. I come from the Eastern
Cape - and I have been instructed by my voters to talk about this - where
the state administration has been plunged into total chaos. In fact,
administratively speaking the Eastern Cape is a disaster area that has
assumed astronomical proportions. [Interjections.] To give the House a
glimpse into the situation there, I would like to take the events in
education as an example to support the above-mentioned statements.]

Madam Speaker, I come from a province where there is money to pay ghost
teachers, whilst some teachers who diligently do their duty go unpaid, some
of them for three years. [Interjections.] I come from a province where, as
I speak, 250 schools are still waiting for their textbooks. It is therefore
not surprising that my province produced some of the worst matric results
last year. A basic thing such as delivering school books does not happen.
[Interjections.] This Minister visited the province. Was it just a social
visit or will action follow? And if it will, when will this action follow?

I come from a province where some teachers abuse learners sexually and
physically on a regular basis, while children are denied access to
institutions of learning because they cannot afford school fees. Finally, I
come from a province where the director-general of education, Mr Manya, who
dared to root out corruption, was threatened with death - we are aware of
this - and had to flee the province, vowing never to return. This happened
one and a half years ago and we are still waiting for a substitute to be
appointed. I do not think this is good enough.

The Minister's smug expression is an indication that he thinks - I can read
his mind - that Mr Lee should know that education is a provincial matter.
[Interjections.] However, I have news for the Minister. According to the
learners, the unions, the teachers and the parents of my province, the buck
stops with the Minister.
In fact, section 100 of the country's Constitution prescribes exactly what
steps the Minister can take when a province cannot or does not fulfil its
executive obligation. This is not something I recommend lightly, but the
situation in the Eastern Cape is desperate and it therefore calls for
desperate measures.

Education in the Eastern Cape is in a terrible mess. It needs bold,
dramatic and imaginative steps to save the situation. [Interjections.]

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: What do they want?

Mr T D LEE: The saying goes: Cometh the hour, cometh the man. That hon
member, whatever his name is, is not the man. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]
The hour for saving education in the Eastern Cape has come. I hope that the
hon the Minister is the man. [Applause.]

Prof S S RIPINGA: Madam Speaker, hon Minister of Education and hon members,
if the hon Mr Lee was a member of the Portfolio Committee on Education, I
think he would have had something to say this afternoon. Members of
Parliament are not delegates; they do not come here to speak when they are
not even alternates in committees. In fact, he would have heard a full
account from the MEC for Education, who presented a full account of the
situation in the Eastern Cape.

The ANC concurs with the Minister of Education when he says that we had a
good year, and we have advanced. True South Africans who have traversed the
length and breadth of this country will bear testimony to this. There is a
need for some hon members to transcend their ideological parameters and see
South Africa through the eyes of a true South African.

Any vigilant person who passed through the corridors in front of the Old
Assembly this afternoon and cared to peruse the mass of documents displayed
there would appreciate that the Department of Education is a department at
work. The restructuring of higher education has been a hotly debated issue
in our country, especially following the release of the National Commission
on Higher Education discussion document, the White Paper, ``National Plan
for Higher Education'' and, of late, ``Restructuring of Higher Education
System - South Africa''.

This should be so, for higher education institutions are the academic focus
of national life reflecting the social, economic, cultural and political
aspirations of the people. They shape national and international ideas.
They offer innovations, encourage global competition and train the future
citizenry. So the shape and future landscape of the higher education system
should be thoroughly and hotly debated. However, the debate must at some
point come to an end. We must take decisions to take us forward.

The higher education sector, as the Minister has already indicated, broadly
agrees that the restructuring of higher education is now beyond debate,
that the current status quo with its inefficiencies and ineffectiveness is
not desirable and that changes are needed. The proposal for restructuring
and consolidation of the landscape, approved by the Cabinet at its meeting
on 29 May 2002, provides a foundation for such changes in higher education
to ensure an accessible, equitable, sustainable, productive and diverse
higher education system that will be of high quality and contribute to the
human resource skills, knowledge and research needs of the country.

We welcome the new landscape, which will consist of 11 universities, six
technikons, four comprehensive institutions, two national institutes and
one dedicated distance education university. We also thank the Minister for
assuring us that no site of delivery will be closed, but rather
restructured to facilitate increased access through the development of
programmes that will address the human resource skills of rural
communities.

I would like to return to the issue of the University of Fort Hare. The
University of Fort Hare has not been retained as an own institution. The
University of Fort Hare will incorporate the East London campus of Rhodes
University and the medical school of the University of Transkei, which will
remain in Umtata. It will focus on expanding access in the East London
area. This decision is in line with the recent decision of the provincial
government to designate East London as an industrial development zone. Fort
Hare therefore is not an own institution. It would be unconstitutional to
retain an undemocratic, racial and sexist institution in that fashion, as
the hon Dr Geldenhuys has mentioned.

It is for this reason that all historically white institutions that will be
retained as separate institutions need to vigorously refocus their
institutional culture. The institutional culture and ethos in these
institutions continue to be eurocentric, with little or no attempt to
locate them in the context of Africa. Kwame Nkrumah reminds us in this
regard, and I quote:


  We must, in the development of universities, bear in mind that once it
  has been planted in African soil, it must take root amidst African
  traditions and culture.

If not, this acts as a barrier to both black students and staff, preventing
them from developing their full potential. It is imperative that these
institutions develop new institutional cultures, identities and policies
based on the values of nonracism, nonsexism and democracy.

We also welcome the assurance by the Ministry that all higher education
institutions will be required to indicate, in their three-year rolling
plans, the strategies and steps they intend taking to transform their
institutional culture and practice in order to create an enabling
environment for all students and staff. We also note with appreciation that
the Ministry will monitor changes in institutional culture and practice
through its recently established Race, Gender and Values Chief Directorate.


Concerns have been raised within and outside the precincts of Parliament
regarding the merger of a university and a technikon. A comprehensive
institution, established from a technikon and a university, is a new
institution. It is a new organisational form which does not reflect its
ingredients. It will have a new mission statement. It has a new mandate,
and a new mission. It will provide a programme mix. It will provide access
in places where technikons were never provided in terms of the past
apartheid legislation. Therefore, the international academic community will
learn from us in this regard.

Implementation will be the most demanding phase of the restructuring
process. There is a need for an increase in the budget allocation for
higher education to enable the higher education system and institutions to
effectively discharge their new mandates and missions; redress that is
appropriate to the mandates and missions; access the necessary expertise to
facilitate mergers; finance the building of capacity and improve salaries,
and ensure that conditions of service, in general, are attractive for
academics and researchers of a high calibre.

The implementation of the proposed landscape at institutional level will
obviously depend, to a large extent, on the availability of administrative
and management abilities and skills. The existing capacity-building
initiatives, aimed at enhancing institutional governance and improving
academic programmes at the historically black institutions, should be
supported and intensified. There must also be great sensitivity to the
employment and the implications of implementing the new landscape at
institutional level. A social plan must be developed by all affected
stakeholders.

In conclusion, times changes. The time to change the higher education
system is now. We support the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, although it is late in the day,
and everybody has been very patient, I am going to take issue with the hon
Mr Lee, who accuses me of smugness. My mother always warned me to keep my
face expressionless. I was not smug. We played cricket with him once or
twice. I should tell him that my philosophy in life, in reaction to events,
is like Gramsci's - I am a pessimist of the intellect and an optimist of
the will. So, it is the will that drives one. Firstly, if anything can get
cocked-up, it is likely to get cocked-up. That is Murphy's law. It is the
optimism of the will that drives us on this side. It drove us for 90 years.
We knew the struggle was difficult.

Therefore, I must say that we are embarking on a problem-solving approach,
because old ways are no ways. We are using the problem-solving approach
because we must demand a degree of self-criticism also, on all sides. We
want self-criticism and analysis of what has gone wrong, and how we can put
it right. That is why I think we should not treat a particular area as a
disaster area. There are enormous problems there - problems of the
Bantustan system which are really extensive and problems in connection with
training. [Interjections.]

That hon member was lucky that, in Cape Town, there was only one Bantustan.
The Northern Province has three Bantustans. There is the Eastern Cape. They
were the first independent states. At the second one, as I remember, the
flag fell down on independence day. I was in exile, but I remember a flag
fell down as they were putting it up. [Laughter.] The flags were falling
down all the time. They are still falling down, unfortunately. We have to
take a progressive approach that will deal with the real problems, and we
are doing it, in accordance with section 100 of the Constitution.

The hon Mpontshane and the hon Geldenhuys blur the difference between the
provinces' functions and the national functions. The state of being a
eunuch does not suit me very well, I must say. The response of celibacy by
par is not, in fact, the prerogative of the harlot. It is also the position
of the eunuch.

I remember writing to the hon Gibson that the constitutional arrangements
we have with regard to education are the constitutional arrangements of
1994. On the one hand, the hon Lee asks why I act like a bystander. On the
other hand, every time I introduce a Bill, to bring some rationalisation,
the same party accuses me of centralisation, nogal.

What I have are regulatory powers. I have powers to lay down the standards.
Can I say that we will take very seriously the regulatory powers of the
national Department? The regulatory powers demand that all provinces must
meet the standards laid down in legislation under norms and standards. If
they do not, they must take political responsibility for that. It is very
important that all of us are convinced that individual and collective
political responsibility has to be taken.

On that basis, we will go forward to problem ...

Mr D H M GIBSON: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER: No, I am not. I challenged the hon Gibson to introduce a
constitutional amendment to provide greater power to the national
Government, but he ran away from that, unfortunately. [Laughter.]

The second point is that the public school system in its entirety
encompasses nearly 30 000 schools. Enormous variations exist. We should
understand there are enormous variations within a province and between
provinces. For example, we have now reduced the inequalities, in
expenditure between provinces by nearly 65%. That is an extraordinary
thing.

Within provinces, there are still enormous inequalities. Rather than say,
as the hon Aucamp has, that we must respect traditions and differences, we
must understand also that there has been enormous investment in schools
such as Grey College or the girls school next to it. They are enormous
investments which we cannot parallel in a township school in Bloemfontein.
I want to ask members, when they invoke culture and tradition, also to
think of the ghost outside which has been excluded. How does one bring the
ghost inside, and give it a corporeal presence? We no longer want to be
excluded ghosts in the mists outside. We cannot tolerate being excluded
outside. That is why it is very important that we should grapple with this.

I worked out five pages of responses that are required. What I will do, for
the first time, is send my replies to every one of the hon members who
participated. I promise I shall do so over the next four or five days.

What I want to deal with, therefore, are some of the fundamental issues
raised. I want to deal with the hon Mnandi's point on indigenous languages.
We say in our National Plan for Higher Education that it is appalling that
we do not have chairs in each of the eleven languages of South Africa. We
will use money to assist the transformed universities and technikons to set
up chairs. I agree that unless one has a chair in a language, that language
will not develop. Nobody will study that language.

In relation to the hon Mulder, one cannot suddenly ask: ``Why cannot we
have a Zulu university?'' That is because one needs textbooks,
dictionaries, the experience and the lecturers. I know that because I lived
in Ireland where there is an Irish university in Galway. In fact, there is
parallel language instruction or dual language instruction in Galway. It is
not as easy as the hon member thinks.

Similarly, in response to the hon Geldenhuys, we do not take our benchmarks
from Taiwan, or even from the European Union, by the way. The European
Union does not say that in respect of mother tongue instruction in higher
education. It does not say that. It says that with respect to basic
education.

We do not take our benchmarks from there. Our benchmarks are what we have
worked out in South Africa. They are South African solutions for our
problems. The Taiwan example is no good because - suddenly Boy Geldenhuys
has become an authority on higher education, so I will tell him - there is
now a fusion between technological and academic institutions. The largest
universities and technological institutions in Britain are merging, such as
the Manchester Institute of Technology and Manchester University, an
enormous university campus. Independently of that, we came up with the
creative idea that if one puts in both technologically and academically
based education, one can, in this fusion, allow the students internally to
be mobile - to move from one area, a purely technical area, to a more
academic area. It is very important that we should do so.

In the remaining time available to me, I will deal with higher education. I
promise, by the way, that I will send replies to each one of the
participants, including the ones who are slightly pregnant in the sense
that they have supported the proposals, on the one hand, but find enough
problems in them to diffuse their support and give them a ``slightly
pregnant'' approach to this matter on the other. I do not think doctors
would approve of this ``slightly pregnant'' state of affairs. One is either
pregnant or not. It would be enjoyable to tackle the hon members on the
basis of real or phantom pregnancies.

Can I therefore very quickly look at higher education? Let me start by
saying that the basic issue of higher education is that we need to
galvanise our energies and strengths to ensure that we are able to bring
about the kind of changes we need. The process is 10 years old. I would
like to tell the hon Mogoba that there will not be a summit. We have gone
through summits since 1991. The time has come to do things.

There are a few issues, first of all regarding the question of values. I
wish to quote the words of the national working group, namely that all
institutions must adopt the kind of positions that allow all students to
feel comfortable in them. Cultural and social reasons will not exclude
them. That is the starting point. There is no threat to anyone.

As far as the Gerwel report is concerned, I said at the portfolio committee
- many of the points raised by the hon members were raised there four days
ago, and I will not take up the time of the National Assembly by repeating
myself here - that we will publish the report and we are studying it. There
is also the Council on Higher Education report on languages, which we have
to look at very carefully. We will look at that carefully and come to a
proper conclusion.

I have met, for example, the Afrikanerbond twice on language issues, so it
is not for want of trying. In the same way, I would like to tell the hon Mr
Aucamp, I met all the religious groups in South Africa. It was the first
time a Minister had met all the religious groups, including the Zion
Christian Church, which is the largest religious group in South Africa,
with four and a half million members, who had never been involved in
consultations.

We have come to the conclusion now. We will set up a national advisory
committee on religion in education. [Interjections.] Yes. We will certainly
be setting it up for advice and we will proclaim that in the Gazette. The
nominations received have all been examined very carefully.

There has been no debacle at the University of South Africa. The
proclamation was made by the Government last May and invitations were made
for responses. One institution responded but the larger institution did not
respond, and we went ahead on that basis. But if illegal action has then
taken place, we must generate every kind of courage and fortitude to ensure
that the public interest is served. Now, we have demanded that there should
be legal action in August because there has been no returning memorandum
from the authorities of the University of South Africa. My own belief is
that the more one keeps lawyers away from educational matters, the better,
because all these matters should be tackled, whether they are in the Free
State or on the Rand, by negotiation and consultation.

I agree that these institutions are not simply spaces for the uncritical
transmission of knowledge. In relation to Afrikaans, I must say that the
Afrikaans vice chancellors of institutions have said before that no
institution should be limited to Afrikaans. I ask members please to
recognise this and not make a voting issue of it. I have said before that
there is a huge amount of fluidity about Afrikaans in the institutions. If
we look at the details, there is essentially no institution that teaches
through Afrikaans only.

What we are now saying is that there is no reason why tuition in higher
education should not be through Afrikaans. The fundamental point, though,
is that we are talking about access. In higher courses, subjects like
engineering and medicine, one cannot have a situation that we have to send
our black students to Cuba to study, because they cannot get admission to
institutions here. We have to look at the admission policies and see what
the selective areas are which are barring young blacks.  Here we are also
saying coloureds, by the way. I am still a UDF man, so by ``blacks'' I mean
those who did not have power before 1994. [Interjections.]

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

The MINISTER: Therefore I ask hon members to be very careful in ensuring
that we lower the temperature. I will reply to everyone, including
regarding this matter. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! The time of the Minister has actually expired.

Dr C P MULDER: As a matter of fact, Madam Speaker, the Minister had four
minutes more than the time allocated in any case.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, I am the one keeping time here. The Minister had 12
minutes. [Interjections.] No, he had 12 minutes. You only know about 10
minutes and I know that he actually had 12. That is why I say that I am the
one who is keeping time and who has details that sometimes go beyond what
you have.

Debate concluded.

                      PUBLIC SERVICE WAGE NEGOTIATIONS

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Madam Speaker and
hon members, my task before this House this afternoon is to give an account
of two important matters. Firstly, I would like to thank Parliament for
allowing us to postpone this statement twice in view of various processes
involving collective bargaining that we were engaged in.

Today I want, firstly, to report briefly on progress regarding
transformation and restructuring in the Public Service and, secondly, to
give an account of the wage increase for Public Service employees for this
financial year, a matter that seems to have gripped the attention of many.
Those who have criticised Government on the basis of unilateralism in the
past are now criticising Government for different reasons, but let me deal
with these issues.

As was very vividly explained, both in the earlier debate and on previous
occasions, the challenge that faces the Public Service emanates from a
system that we actually inherited in 1994: a rather bitter legacy, a legacy
rooted in a philosophy and design of the Public Service that was exclusive,
discriminatory and served the interests of the minority to the exclusion of
the majority. We saw the rationalisation process of the former apartheid
establishment, the former self-governing homelands, independent states and
provincial administrations. That was the first step in the transformation
of the Public Service.
These institutions brought with them different systems, skills profiles,
cultures, work ethics and so forth, but had one common feature: they were
not structured or poised to ensure the service delivery required by our
democracy. We have succeeded in merging these institutions, but what
remains outstanding - a difficult challenge that we are confronting and
will confront now - is to ensure a Public Service in a developmental and
democratic state that meets the needs of the majority of our people.

However, at the same time, while we were battling these apartheid-inherited
challenges, advances made on the technological front brought forth their
own challenges to all organisations, internationally and domestically, in
so-called developed countries and those of us facing immense poverty
issues, in the public as well as the private sector. Not a single
organisation remains isolated from these contextual changes, and
organisations have to ask themselves continually whether the way that they
are working and structured is keeping up with the demands of the time.

Our approach to transformation is captured in the Constitution, which
communicates the type of Public Service that we are trying to establish.
Amongst other things, this should be a Public Service which promotes
equitable, efficient and effective use of resources. These are issues
raised earlier today.

It must promote a high standard and ethos as well as professional ethics,
and have a developmental orientation that is responsive to the needs of all
citizens. Furthermore, the Constitution demands that the Public Service
should be transparent, representative and promote human resource
development.

Looking at the nature of the Public Service we inherited, we have stated
repeatedly that this Government has an immense task of turning the system
around to move towards being consistent with these constitutional
principles and values. Clearly, it would be neither realistic nor possible
to try everything at once. That is why we identified a set of
transformation priorities in the various policy documents.

It is, however, regrettable - and I stated this on 23 May - that the
resolution on the restructuring of the Public Service was signed by only
42% of trade unions represented in the Public Sector Co-ordinating
Bargaining Council. This leaves us with no option but to go ahead with the
implementation as I had outlined on 23 May.

In terms of our commitment to collective and centralised bargaining, we
will still attempt to ensure that all the representatives of organised
labour walk the transformation path with us. However, if we cannot achieve
this, we are prepared to walk the path with fewer union partners. Hence,
the framework agreement resolution will be translated into regulations for
gazetting on 14 June and promulgated for its effective implementation on 17
June 2002.

We are seeking to address key issues such as poor distribution of skills
and resources across the Public Service in all spheres of government,
undesirable attitude towards work and to our citizens, unresponsive and
inefficient modes of service delivery, as well as outdated systems and
procedures. All these require focused attention if we are to have a system
that is consistent with the values of the Constitution.

In dealing with these matters, it would be important to keep in mind that
restructuring assumes its nature, extent and pace from contextual
realities. Therefore, it would be unhelpful and perhaps wrong to adopt a
stance that narrowly equates transformation and restructuring with
retrenchment.

Government's approach in addressing restructuring will be based on
principles stated in the transformation framework agreement, these being:
Providing for redeployment, retraining and alternative employment for
excess employees; secondly, developing sector strategies for job creation;
and thirdly, complying with legal frameworks regulating employment. As
Government we are mindful of the social consequences of restructuring and
transformation. We are also deeply conscious of why we are taking this
route and the fact that we want better service delivery for the South
African citizenry.

In instances of unavoidable retrenchments, the inclusion of a social plan
will form a fundamental part of the process. Whilst there is overstaffing
in some parts of the Public Service, it should be noted that in other parts
instances of understaffing do exist. This would require an accompanying
increase in personnel. Hence, I would want to state today that we all
should note that the nature of restructuring does not come as a packaged
standardised commodity.

The critical issue is to ensure that we do what is consistent with our
vision, principles and values. We will ensure that we expand where
required, in line with our service delivery needs, and review where there
may be excesses and see how we facilitate redeployment of those employees,
first and foremost.

Let me go to the issue of the wage settlement. In line with the need for us
to build a Public Service that is in keeping with the demands of
functioning as a modern knowledge-based organisation, we have to think of a
salary dispensation that will support the achievement of this imperative.
In this vein we tackled the issue of salary increases for this year.

On Tuesday, 4 June 2002, as Government, together with our 12 labour
partners in the public sector, we concluded a wage agreement for the
financial year 2002-03. This was in line with our commitment to the spirit
of the multiterm agreement that we had signed last year. All 12 of the
unions signed the resolution and it provides for the following: An annual
increase of a maximum of 9% to all public service employees at levels 1 to
12. This allows for an increase at entry level, our lowest paid employee,
that translates into an increase from R25 959 per annum to R28 296 per
annum. The total increase in this band stands at R2 337 per annum. All
employees in levels 1 to 12 will receive a once-off final payment of R850
towards pay progression whilst the Public Sector Co-ordinating Bargaining
Council is finalising the pay progression system.

Finally, this broadly increases our wage bill from R81,141 billion to
R88,444 billion. The actual increase is R7,302 billion. This amount
includes an increase in the pension contribution and the 13th cheque. I
want to re-emphasize that the wage increase is in keeping with the
multiterm agreement reached last year. It also provides us with the
opportunity to deal with matters of a transformation nature, while we are
bound to a multiterm remuneration agreement.

The 9% is effective compensation for the inflation increase. In actual
fact, 9% is or will be below the main year-to-year inflation figure. It is
thus no exaggeration to state that prices are up by 9%, compared to a year
ago. And for most of the public servants who are in the R100 000 per annum
bracket, their consumption basket has probably increased a bit above
inflation,  a bit above the CPIX average.

Our position as Government is that we are providing against the adverse
effects of the rand's decline that we saw late last year and the increase
in food prices earlier this year. We would also like to retain real
consumption spending power, given the price adjustments that the rand
depreciation caused.

I therefore would like to dismiss allegations that this year's adjustment
serves as an inflationary signal to the private sector. I would also like
to state that the bargaining processes are distinct, and if there are any
linkages, it must be noted that for the past few years the public sector
had lagged behind the private sector in wage settlements. Perhaps this year
we should see it as a reverse.

I would like to go further and emphasize that the notion that the 9%
increase works against the country's inflation targeting strategy is
incorrect and mischievous. On the contrary, as I have mentioned earlier,
the multiterm agreement was linked to a wage band which we were clearly
outside of; hence the settlement which we formalised on 4 June. Moreover,
the notion that the 9% increase is the highest ever in the Public Service
is nonsensical, false and uninformed.

In July 1996 salaries were adjusted on a 21% average, with the CPIX -
inflation at the time - standing at 6,1%. I also want to state that a
mandate of a 9% adjustment was a decision that was taken by the mandate
committee, a subcommittee of Cabinet, which considered affordability and
also current economic realities.

We are committed to pushing back the frontiers of poverty. This Government
has committed itself to the transformation of the Public Service into a
focused, competent, representative, coherent and democratic instrument for
the implementation of Government policies and for meeting the needs of all
South Africans on an equitable basis.

The Public Service, therefore, has to continue with transformation
programmes and respond to and drive the agenda of Government, based on the
vision of a better life for all. Delivering the best service for the people
is not negotiable, and achieving a better life for all is a must. As we
work towards successfully transforming the Public Service, we should do so
without expecting to be mentioned or to score points. I want to quote the
socialist poet Bertolt Brecht when he said:


  Why should the baker be asked for if there is enough bread? Why should
  the snow be praised that has melted if new snowfalls are impending? Why
  should there be a past if there is a future?

As a result, I want to say, as we confront and engage on the issue of wage
increases, we should think of that. As we confront and take forward, as
revolutionaries, the real difficulty of transformation through
restructuring of the Public Service, let us remember Brecht. [Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Madam Speaker, hon Minister and hon members, the 9% across-the-
board increase for all public servants agreed to by the Government and
trade unions this week has two fundamental problems.

Firstly, it is higher than inflation and exceeds the 7,5% ceiling agreed to
last year when the multiterm agreement was signed. The increases will have
to be funded, as usual, by the taxpayer at a total cost, as the Minister
mentioned, of R7,3 billion. Secondly, it is across the board and ignores
the performance of individual public servants and fails to address the
plunder of skills from our Public Service.

In a letter to the Reserve Bank Governor on 21 February 2000, our Minister
of Finance clearly stated that the inflation target for the year 2000 would
be 3% to 6%. I would like to quote the Minister here: `` The success of the
inflation-targeting regime will require the participation of all of the
South African public that includes the Public Service - I would like to say
to the Minister - its firms, unions, NGOs and civic groups.

It is quite clear that the Minister for the Public Service and
Administration and the committee she mentioned have ignored the plea made
by her very own colleague. Not only will this increase put pressure on the
Reserve Bank to keep to its inflation target, but it will also put pressure
on interest rates, which look like they will be increasing.
The DA will never stop urging Government to approach its role as an
employer with a fresh, modern attitude. The current ``one size fits all''
mentality to increases completely ignores individual performances and is
totally archaic. Performance levels of hard-working public servants are
neglected while lazy public servants are rewarded with 9% increases.

The Minister is inconsistent with her own performance management approach,
adopted in the Public Service regulations in which every employee must be
assessed according to an annual performance cycle. This also fails to
address the gross underpayment of certain professions, such as nurses and
police officers, who are being poached by the UK and other countries in
their hundreds. The loss of skills will continue until the ANC Government
modernises its relationship with its employees.

These two professions are both grossly underpaid and it is no small wonder
that South Africa still has a band of very hard working and loyal nurses
and police officers who continue to labour for the love of the work not the
money. There are not many people in this Chamber who would do their job for
the amount of money they earn. I would not be surprised if Scotland Yard
were taken up on its offer to recruit 5 000 of our own police officers. Few
are in a position to resist this temptation.

The DA regards the R850 once-off payment offered by the Minister as an
insult if it is really intended to raise morale, as she has publicly
stated. I doubt if there is one person in this Chamber who would be
motivated by R850 for any length of time. Why is it then that we expect it
to motivate the Public Service? Perhaps the attitude is, ``let us shut up
the masses with a crumb or two''.

The DA proposes the abolition of the central bargaining chamber of the
Public Service in order for departments and sectors to negotiate directly
with employees' organisations on terms which meet their specific needs. Not
only will this allow for performance to be taken into account, but it will
also give the Government the latitude to award higher increases to skills
that are fast becoming more and more scarce in the Public Service.

Lastly, may I once again urge the Minister to challenge the outdated
assumption that should have gone out of fashion with the NP, and that is
the idea that fair pay means that everyone should get the same increases or
that pay and employment conditions must be set nationally. They should be
the first to go. [Applause.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Madam Speaker, hon members of this House, last year hon
members will remember that negotiations were met with a bilious reaction
from unions and stakeholders. This year we welcome the efforts of the hon
the Minister and the manner in which she and her department handled the
negotiations on salaries.

The bargaining councils continue to play a critical role in shaping and
sharpening labour relations in the Public Service. All Government employees
from Level 1 to Level 12 will receive an across-the-board increase of 9%.
The IFP supports this move as this will prevent protracted standoffs
between the unions and the department.

This 9%, we believe, will help to boost morale and create a strong Public
Service ethos, hence increasing levels of service delivery. This also sends
a strong message to trade unions about where to pitch their demands.

In essence, the Public Service in particular is the single largest employer
in this country. It is also clear that poverty and unemployment are
unacceptably high. The hardships and suffering of the unemployed are a
severe indictment of our society.

We know that inflation this year hovers around 7% to 8%. Thus, it is common
knowledge that we are in for turbulent times as consumer prices, fuel
prices and interest rates begin to escalate, a sobering thought indeed.

Given the critical role of the Public Service, we must also ensure the
commitment and collaboration of all stakeholders. This means that
negotiations often have to go beyond the traditional collective bargaining
strategies and tactics, and become more innovative so that parties can
forge partnerships and deliver to the people of this country. All
stakeholders should understand that the employer-employee relationship is
focused predominantly on delivery.

Although the restructuring process will result in strained relationships
between the unions and the department, we believe that negotiations have to
be viewed as genuine, given the resolution of the impasse on salaries. I
also want to stress that this will have a psychological impact on workers
who endeavour towards job security and basic bread-and-butter issues. If
restructuring is negatively perceived and executed, it will no doubt have a
snowball effect on people's livelihoods, the very communities and
constituencies that we represent.

The main objective of restructuring is to ensure a leaner and meaner Public
Service, in line with constitutional prerogatives, so that service delivery
improves. It is a fact that restructuring mainly affects those workers who,
in the eyes of the employer, do not deliver according to expected levels. I
know that the hon Waters spoke at length about this.

So there will be resistance from those quarters. But we also need to send a
strong message to those who are not performing that Government is not an
alternative for them. For us to contribute effectively to the
transformation of the Public Service, collective bargaining must be
performed in a professional and constructive manner. In other words, it is
not primarily about material wealth, it is about people.
On a lighter note, my colleagues in the IFP have asked me to lobby the hon
the Minister to reciprocate this 9% to the hard-working and diligent MPs
who have remained behind to listen to this. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, during the debate on the Vote of the
Department for the Public Service and Administration, I referred to the
Minister's dedication to building the Public Service into an effective and
efficient organisation that requires the utmost dedication from every
public servant.

One of the cornerstones of a dedicated Public Service is the morale and the
wellbeing of the workforce. Financial worries and monetary constraints most
probably comprise one of the biggest demolishers of morale for any person.

I have already thanked the Minister during the discussion of the Vote for
timeously taking care of the uncertainty around salary increases this year.
Her announcement today is proof of the success that can be achieved if a
Minister works with dedication towards achieving the goals within his or
her department, and I want to thank her this afternoon for the way in which
she is tackling the problems in the Public Service.

Die aankondiging van die Minister vandag staan in skrille kontras met
vorige jare se uitgerekte, onsmaaklike gevegte om 'n ooreenkoms te bereik.
Die Nuwe NP wil dan ook die hoop uitspreek dat die gladde verloop van
hierdie onderhandelinge, en die eenparige instemming van al 12 die
Staatsdiensvakbonde, die voorloper is van verdere suksesvolle
onderhandelinge tussen die Regering en die betrokke vakbonde met betrekking
tot die transformasie en herstrukturering van die Staatsdiens.

Die Nuwe NP wil egter ook terselfdertyd 'n beroep doen op staatsamptenare
om hulself onvermoeid te beywer om te help met die bouproses in Suid-
Afrika. Hulle moet ons help om van Suid-Afrika 'n beter plek te maak deur
die diens wat hulle behoort te lewer aan elke persoon in hierdie land,
sodat ons saam kan bou aan 'n staatsdiens waarop elke landsburger trots kan
wees. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The announcement by the Minister today is in sharp contrast to the
protracted and unpleasant quarrels of the past to reach an agreement. The
New NP would then also like to express the hope that the smooth course of
these negotiations and the unanimous agreement of all 12 Public Service
trade unions is the precursor to further successful negotiations between
the Government and the relevant trade unions with regard to the
transformation and restructuring of the Public Service.

However, the New NP would at the same time like to appeal to public
servants to strive tirelessly to help with the building process in South
Africa. They must help us to make South Africa a better place by the
service which they are supposed to render to every person in this country,
so that together we can build on a public service of which every citizen
can be proud.]

We know that there were role-players behind the scenes who made this
announcement today possible. We want to thank them for their hard work and
dedication to bring about the kind of result that portrays a positive image
of the Public Service in this country, and we want to wish them well with
future negotiations.

Finally, I think typically of the DA, we heard two speeches here today. The
first speech said ``it is too much'', and the second said ``it is too
little''. I do not know what the confusion is. [Interjections.] They are as
confused by their own speechwriters as they are by the Harksen issue.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker, the wage settlement between the unions and
the Government in the Bargaining Council has brought an end to a long
series of meetings. While the agreement ushers in a 9% increase, it must
not be forgotten that public servants are, in many cases, hard put to cope
with the recent steep increases in the cost of basic consumer requirements.

Last year alone the rand lost 37% of its value against the dollar, and this
has inevitably led to the sharp rise in particularly food inflation. It is
simply a matter of common sense that one cannot reasonably expect increased
production or improved service from people who are constantly worried about
their children starving. In this sense, the agreement is welcomed and the
private sector is reminded or urged to adopt a similar stance.

While business should not fear taking the same route with their employees
as Government is doing with its public servants, the obverse side of the
coin, the need for increased productivity and improved service delivery in
the interests of building the economy as a whole, must be constantly kept
in mind by employees as well. At the same time, in the context of improving
the economy as a whole and in the interests of making South Africa a
prosperous country, all stakeholders are urged to walk that extra mile in
their service to the people at large. We support the settlement.
[Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, we support the statement of the Minister. We
believe that she has managed to achieve broad consensus on these issues and
that she has done extensive consultation. The approval of the unions which
have agreed is indicative of this fact. Although there might be technical
problems with regard to the resolution on transformation and restructuring
as long as the other unions have not signed, we believe that we have done
enough. The programme of restructuring and transformation has taken into
account all residual problems that may arise, and we believe that the
Ministry has put sufficient mechanisms in place to deal with these.
It would be unreasonable, therefore, to reject the Ministry's restructuring
and transformation programme, after such a painstaking consultative
process. Some have raised the issue that the increase of 9% is below
inflation, but we believe that it is nonetheless a progressive increase.
[Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, die laaste ding waarin die VF betrokke
wil raak, is in 'n geveg tussen die Nuwe NP en die DP, maar die standpunt
van die VF is dat die 9% 'n billike verhoging is.

Ons stem egter saam dat daar gekyk moet word na die uitgawes van die
Staatsdiens as geheel. In hierdie opsig was dit nog altyd die beleid en die
standpunt van die Regering dat daar uiteindelik 'n kleiner Staatsdiens moet
wees. Daarom, om uitgawes te beperk, is dit die VF se standpunt dat daar 'n
kleiner, meer effektiewe staatsdiens gevestig moet word. So kan daar
bespaar word.

Ek wil voorstel dat die agb Minister haar kundigheid ten opsigte van die
hantering van die vakbonde miskien met haar senior kollegas ook deel, veral
wanneer dit gaan oor privatisering. Party vakbonde sal dalk dan kan
verstaan waaroor privatisering gaan, en daar sal dalk ook verdere vordering
wees in daardie sektor. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, the last thing the FF wants to become
involved in is a fight between the New NP and the DP, but the FF's position
is that 9% is a reasonable increase.

However, we agree that the expenditure of the Public Service as a whole
must be examined. In this regard it has always been the policy and the
position of the Government that there should actually be a smaller Public
Service. Therefore, to restrict expenditure, it is the FF's position that a
smaller, more effective Public Service should be established. Money can be
saved in this way.

I want to propose that the hon the Minister should possibly share her
expertise with regard to the handling of the trade unions with her senior
colleagues, particularly with regard to privatisation. Some trade unions
may then understand what privatisation is about, and there may also be
further progress in that sector.]

Mrs M A SEECO: Madam Speaker, the UCDP compliments the Minister for the
Public Service and Administration on the efforts she has made for our
public servants. We are thankful that the unions continue to buy into the
negotiations. After all, half a loaf is better than no bread. This
motivation should ensure that our South African public is served with
dignity. It goes with the spirit of Batho Pele and the spirit of
Vuk'uzenzele, to arise and act to ensure that proper services will be
rendered in our working places.

We are confident that the 9% will produce better productivity. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, after the long negotiations and many
strikes, the MF is pleased to note the 9% increase in the Public Service
wage budget from R81, 1 billion to R106 billion, after bonuses and other
benefits. It is heartening to note the agreement concluded on Tuesday by
the Government and the 12 public sector unions, clearly illustrating our
ability to work together. The MF sincerely hopes that this will put
pressure on the private sector to do the same. With the rising inflation
rate and the economic shock of ever-rising food prices, the increase will
certainly assist workers.

The MF also shares the sentiments of the hon the Minister that this
increase will boost the morale of public servants to play a bigger role in
improving service delivery. The MF is certain that this will stabilise the
public service sector and promote sustainable development within the labour
sector. The MF supports this wage increase. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mev die Speaker, die Minister het twee sake aangeroer: een
was die kwessie van transformasie in die Staatsdiens. Ons wil maar net
daarteen waarsku dat transformasie nie moet geskied ten koste van
dienslewering en ervaring nie. Daar moet dus nie 'n uitvloei van kragte
wees nie.

Wat betref die verhoging, wil ons die Minister steun. Sy het die wysheid
van Salomo nodig om aan hierdie saak reg te laat geskied, maar sy het
ongelukkig nie die rykdomme van Salomo om dit te kan doen nie. Ek dink 9%
is 'n billike verhoging. Ons wil ook glo dat dit sal bydra tot 'n meer
effektiewe Staatsdiens.
Iemand vra nou die dag vir my: ``Hoekom het Pretoria soveel
eenrigtingstrate?'' Die persoon sê toe dit is sodat die staatsamptenare wat
laat kom vir werk, nie vasry teen dié wat vroeg huis toe gaan nie.

Ons steun dit, en ons vra dat die Staatsdiens ook hierop sal antwoord met
lojaliteit en toewyding sodat ons 'n beter diens kan kry. (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, the Minister touched on two issues: one was
the issue of transformation in the Public Service. We would just like to
warn that transformation should not take place at the expense of service
delivery and experience. There must therefore not be an exodus of ability.

As regards the increase, we want to support the Minister. She needs the
wisdom of Solomon for justice to be done with regard to this matter, but
unfortunately she does not have the wealth of Solomon to be able to do it.
I think 9% is a reasonable increase. We also want to believe that it will
contribute to a more effective Public Service.

Recently someone asked me: ``Why does Pretoria have so many one-way
streets?'' The person then said it is so that the public servants who are
arriving late for work do not drive into those who are going home early.

We support this, and we ask that the Public Service will also responds to
this with loyalty and dedication so that we can have a better service.]

Mr P J GOMOMO: Madam Speaker and members at large, I rise to add my voice
to those applauding this settlement as a step in the right direction to
improve the conditions of service for Public Service employees and also to
restructure the Public Service as a state vehicle to entrench a democratic
political dispensation. he increment is largely a credit to the Government
as a credible employer that negotiates in good faith, as its offer is in
keeping with the agreement signed in 2001 and is escalated to meet the
challenges of inflation.

I want to take the opportunity to commend all the parties that were
involved in the negotiations and particularly those who saw a need and
responded to the call for reasonableness by signing the agreement that
resulted in this increment. It is a hard-earned achievement and we salute
the hon the Minister's efforts. However, we call for the harmonious
environment occasioned by this agreement to be translated into renewed
vigour and accelerated service delivery at all levels.

Whereas we celebrate the jubilation of the signing of the wage increment
and whereas we acknowledge that previous agreements in the PSCBC saw this
as an improvement in the conditions of service that would facilitate other
developments, we acknowledge that there is still unfinished business, which
is the restructuring of the Public Service. In this regard we note the
statement that has been made by the hon the Minister for the Public Service
and Administration.

I wish to put on record that we always view the restructuring of the Public
Service as yet another step in the right direction, as it seeks to cement
the rationalisation of a previously divided Public Service and provides a
framework for an accountable and efficient Public Service with suitably
placed personnel.

Being a product of the Public Service Jobs Summit Framework Agreement, the
negotiation is handled within legitimate processes in terms of the
established collective bargaining arrangements. We can only hope that the
parties will reach out to one another so that a majority of parties sign
the proposed agreement and marshal an amicable settlement. We know that it
may be difficult to always resolve issues peacefully, but in this regard a
peaceful settlement is not impossible.

The parties concerned, which, have no doubt, are able negotiators in their
individual right, may be reminded of two things: Firstly, when discussing
the transformation and restructuring of the Public Service at the Public
Service Jobs Summit and noting the otherwise challenging circumstances
under which such transformation and restructuring had to take place, they
acknowledged that they shared a common commitment to the broader interest
of serving the South African nation. Secondly, it is an acceptable reality
that negotiations like those most often cannot take place in a hostile
environment and that differences that may seem to be there are part of the
historical legacy that has to broken.

In the light of this, I believe that there is still room for a peaceful
settlement of negotiations. Consultation and persuasion must be given a
chance.

I want to remind Mike Waters ...

An HON MEMBER: The hon Mike Waters!

Mr P J GOMOMO: Yes, indeed. I want to remind the hon Mike Waters that we
were all part of the signing of the framework agreement, and this agreement
is the continuation of the agreement that we signed, all of us. We cannot
sabotage it at this stage. Those members are always telling the public that
they are concerned about the people on the ground who are unemployed or
earning low wages. Now we are giving people very reasonable wages, and
those members are also against that. [Interjections.] They should
reconsider their positions.

I therefore want to reiterate my call that all parties should agree to go
the extra mile and put in an extra effort to settle the matter amicably.
[Time expired.]

Debate concluded.
The House adjourned at 18.15.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs on Budget Vote 4:
     Home Affairs, dated 4 June 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, having considered and examined
     Budget Vote 4: Home Affairs, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         On 21 May and 4 June 2002, the Committee was extensively briefed
         by the Director-General and senior officials on the budget
         allocation for the Department of Home Affairs for the 2002-03
         financial year.


         The Committee noted that an amount of R1 251 188 000 is included
         in the government's budget for 2002-03 in respect of the
         Department. Compared to 2001 there has been an increase of R228,8
         million. The largest percentage of this increase can be attributed
         to the upgrading the infrastructure of all crucial systems,
         including rewriting the Population Register, upgrading the
         Movement Control System, and implementing the Document Management
         System and transfers to the IEC, to enable it to conduct by-
         elections, upgrade systems and prepare for the national elections
         in 2004.
     B.     Programme 1: Administration


         The budget for Administration will grow by 10,3% over the medium
         term. 64,2% of the allocation for Administration is consumed by
         personnel expenditure as posts have been filled to increase
         capacity in the Department.


         Spending on professional and special services increases by 9,6%
         per year until 2004-05 to accommodate the computerisation of the
         Department and expansion of the IT function.


         1. Computerisation of Offices


              For the current financial year, 30 offices of the Department
              for the 10 regions have been identified for computerisation.
              Regions like the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and
              Mpumalanga will receive priority as they have less than 50% of
              their offices computerised at present. An amount of R215 000
              will also be spent on equipment to upgrade the passport
              system.
              The Committee notes progress in this area, but a lot still
              needs to be done. This will go a long way towards providing
              efficient services to our people.


              We also believe that computerisation will contribute to the
              elimination of corruption.


         2. Task Team on Electoral Act
              In March 2002, the Cabinet adopted the Department's Cabinet
              Memorandum 3 of 2002, on the establishment of an electoral law
              task team. The Committee notes that the Cabinet Memorandum
              provided for R450 000 for the work of the task team. However,
              the chairperson of the task team drew up a budget for the task
              team that amounted to R3,5 million.


              The Committee notes with concern that not enough money has
              been allocated for the task team to do its work. The team has
              been allocated R450 000, whereas it needs R3,5 million.


              We appeal to the government to attend to this matter, as the
              task team is expected to finish its work by November this
              year.


         3. Personnel Establishment


              The Committee has noted with concern that the Department is
              still functioning with a staff establishment that was fixed by
              the Office of the Public Service Commission in 1995. 730 of
              the Department's posts are vacant; only 234 of these vacancies
              are funded, and the Department is in the process of filling
              them. The remaining 496 posts are unfunded and cannot be
              filled due to public service regulations. These vacancies
              severely hamper the Department in its efforts to provide an
              efficient and accessible service to citizens. The results are
              long queues at virtually all the Department's regional and
              local offices.


              The Committee notes with concern the shortage of staff in the
              Department. We therefore urge the Department to finalise the
              compilation of a scientifically-based staff establishment.


     C.     Programme 2: Service to citizens


         The amount allocated to this programme is R580,799 million, and
         the main spending items include:


         *  The Hanis project


         *  Rewriting the population register


         *  Implementing the Electronic Document Management System.


         1. Home Affairs National Identification System (HANIS)


              The Committee has been informed that the total expenditure on
              HANIS until March 2002 amounted to R495 122 478. The
              Department has also introduced an additional phase, which will
              be the expansion of HANIS to regional and subregional offices.
              The Identification Subsystem is being upgraded to cater for 42
              000 forms per day, and should be completed at the end of
              August 2002, according to the Department.


              The budget allocated for 2002-03 will be spent as follows:


              Personnel      R7,593,042 million
              Administrative expenses   R1,131,600 million
              Inventories    R1,124,000 million
              Equipment      R148,622,899 million
              Professional Services     R59,458,459 million


              The Department is optimistic that it will be able to generate
              funds for the National Treasury by providing a Remote
              Verification Service to cater for the needs of the Commercial
              Sector. This will enable interested parties to query HANIS
              databases and to do reliable data verification. A call centre
              for this purpose will be established later in the year.


              The Committee noted the progress made by the Department in
              establishing the HANIS system. It is, however, clear that a
              lot of interaction with the Department is still needed,
              especially in the form of committee briefings, to ensure that
              the implementation of the system occurs with some speed. We
              also believe that this will go a long way to eliminate
              corruption in the Department.


         2. Population Register


              The Committee notes the work done by the Department on the
              population register, especially the registration of three
              million children eligible for a grant by 2005.


         3. Electronic Document Management System (EDMS)


              The objective of the EDMS is to implement an effective, real-
              time, on-line solution that will cater for the automated
              document management process, resulting in overall business
              process efficiency. The system will make all Home Affairs
              records and archiving information immediately available for
              access to any authorised individual at any workstation in the
              system, both nationally and internationally.


              Phase 1 that is currently being implemented, includes:


              -   The implementation of a centralised EDMS to cater for the
                  Department's management of business processes related to
                  births, marriages and deaths, and an effective Management
                  Information System


              -   High volume document capture modules


              -   Centralised indexing environment


              -   An effective on-line storage environment


              -   A disaster recovery facility


              -   Integration with the National Population Register


              The budget for phase 2 is R35 million, and it is envisaged to
              be utilised for:


              Hardware R8 million
              Workflow Software    R4 million
              Training R2,95 million
              System Integration   R3,3 million
              Professional Services     R2,7 million
              Infrastructere upgrades   R5,5 million
              Hard- and Software support      R5,45 million
              Change Management    R3,1 million


         4. Improvement of services to poor, rural and disadvantaged
              communities


              Infrastructural Development


              The Committee commends the Department for its partnership with
              a private company, which will provide the Department with 100
              freight containers, to be deployed in rural communities, where
              access to services is difficult due to geographical and
              logistical reasons.


              The Committee urges the Department to expedite the opening of
              these offices as part of the overall objective of service
              delivery by the government.


              We continue to express concern about the delapidated state of
              buildings that are used for the provision of Home Affairs
              services in a number of areas.


              Rural masses continue to be denied access, or experience
              difficulty to obtain access to, Home Affairs services. It is
              important to move with some speed to ensure that Home Affairs
              has offices in the rural areas.


              We commend and note the container solution that will make
              services more accessible to rural and disadvantaged
              communities. It is, however, only a short-term solution. A
              clear long-term strategic plan should be developed to provide
              permanent infrastructure for the Department in these
              communities. The Committee recommends that the Department
              should draw up a strategic infrastructure development plan to
              accomplish this.


         5. Reorganisation and restructuring


              The Committee notes that the Department recently tabled its
              second strategic plan. We also note that the Minister
              emphasised that the reorganisation and restructuring of the
              Department should be shaped by the Immigration Bill and the
              devolution of civic affairs delivery functions to
              municipalities.


     D.     Programme 3: Migration


         The reprioritised amount allocated to this programme is R230 139
         million. The main issue addressed in this programme is the
         redesigning of the Movement Control System (MCS) to a real-time on-
         line system.


         1. Movement Control System


              The Committee notes the progress the Department is making in
              redesigning the Movement Control System to a real-time on-line
              system.


              The objectives of the Movement Control Project are as follows:


              -   Implement a centrally driven and managed system, which
                  will function on a real-time on-line basis


              -   Permit immediate and simultaneous access to movement data
                  by all Ports of Entry


              -   Ensure information integrity and validity pertaining to
                  the movements of aliens and South African residents
                  across our borders


              -   Improve and enhance service to persons utilising the
                  services of the Chief Directorate: Migration


              -   Enable integration between all systems and databases
                  utilised by the Chief Directorate: Migration


              -   Remove backlogs and current inconsistencies in the
                  Movement Control environment


              -   Introduce electronic workflow to the Movement Control
                  environment to ensure reduction in fraud and corruption
                  opportunities


              The budget allocated for the MCS for the current financial
              year is R45 million, and the breakdown is as follows:


              Hardware R15 million
              Software R5 million
              Workflow Software    R2 million
              Training R1,5 million
              System Integration   R2,5 million
              Professional Services     R6 million
              Core infrastructure upgrades    R3 million
              Change Management    R3 million
              Hardware and Software support   R7 million


         2. Implementation of new Immigration System


              The Immigration Bill was approved by the National Assembly in
              May 2002, and the financial implications of the Bill is
              estimated at R13,698 million for the 2002-03 financial year.


              The Committee notes that the Department is still busy
              finalising the allocation of funds to implement the new
              Immigration System. We also note that funds that was earmarked
              for Immigration under the previous Aliens Control Act will be
              reprioritised and integrated for implementation of the new
              system. We further note that the Department is still busy
              assessing exactly how much funds will be needed to implement
              the new system.


         3. Ports of entry


              The number of persons that use our ports of entry to enter and
              depart from our country, has grown from 19,8 million per year
              in 1994 to 28,3 million per year in 2001. This represents an
              increase of 42,9%, while the staff establishment at most of
              these ports has not been reviewed since 1995 and no real
              changes in respect of funding or accommodation requirements
              have materialised.


              In 1997, the Cabinet approved an amount of R101 million for
              upgrading the ports of entry. However, divided between 53
              ports, these improvements could still not satisfactorily
              address the needs at border posts. The Committee was informed
              by the Department that it simply cannot cope with the
              increased pressure on its budget, by means of reprioritising
              existing funds, to upgrade and staff existing border posts and
              to erect new border posts, which is the expectation raised by
              the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism in its
              Cabinet Memorandum to the Cabinet.


              The Committee was further informed by the Department that,
              based on an investigation by a consultant appointed by the
              Department of Public Works, an amount of R94,6 million is
              needed to bring the infrastructure at our land border posts up
              to an acceptable level to cope with the increased flow of
              travellers through them, to create a favourable impression as
              visitors enter the RSA and to ensure an acceptable level of
              security at these ports of entry.


         4. Undocumented migration


              The Committee recognises the damage that results from
              uncontrolled and unregulated migration to South Africa. We
              believe that the new immigration legislation passed by the
              Committee will go a long way to provide the Department with
              teeth to deal with the real issues that face South Africa as a
              result of economic migration to South Africa.


     E.     Programme 4: Auxiliary and associated services
         The reprioritised amount allocated to this programme is R227 227
         million, and includes:


         1. Film and Publication Board/Film and Publication Review Board


              The increase of funding to the Film and Publication Board over
              the medium term is necessary to accommodate the expansion of
              the mandate of the Board to include the protection of children
              from exploitation and internet pornography.


         2. Government printing works


              The Committee expresses concern that the Department is owed a
              lot of money by other departments that had made use of
              printing services.


              We also note that, having completed a feasibility study on the
              possibility to privatise the Government Printing Works, and
              having submitted to Cabinet a number of alternatives, the
              Cabinet approved that a public enterprise be established, with
              a small private equity shareholding, and that the objective is
              to recover labour and material costs.


         3. Electoral Commission


              The Committee notes the Financial Statements of the Electoral
              Commission for 1998-99, 1999-00 and 2000-01, including the
              report of the Auditor-General on the same, recently referred
              to the Committee.

2.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Transport on Visit to Durban,
     City Deep and Pretcon Container Terminals, dated 5 June 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on Transport, having undertaken a tour of
     Durban, City Deep and Pretcon Container Terminals on 29 April and 3 May
     2002, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction
         The Committee embarked on a fact-finding mission to establish the
         role played by the container terminals and private freight
         operators in promoting the use of rail. Also considered was what
         is being done to attract freight from road to rail; whether there
         are any factors that may impact negatively on the use of rail;
         and, lastly, what could be done in the short term to make rail a
         naturally preferred mode of transport.


         This follows a Cabinet decision to support a movement of freight
         from road to rail. The Committee, in exercising its oversight
         function, took it upon itself to meet with relevant stakeholders.


         A multi-party delegation of four members took part in a visit to
         Durban on 29 April 2002 and to Gauteng on 3 May 2002.


         GAUTENG DURBAN


         Mr G Schneemann (Group leader) Mr G Schneemann
         Mrs D N Mbombo      Mr N Magubane
         Mr S Farrow   Mr S Farrow
         Mr J J Niemann      Mr J J Niemann


         In order to examine these important issues, the delegation visited
         two major container terminals (City Deep & Pretcon) operated by
         Spoornet, and Durban Container Terminal operated by South African
         Port Operations (SAPO), and met with the following private freight
         operators:


         1. Rail Road Africa
         2. Cross Country Containers
         3. Roadwing
         4. MSC Logistics
         5. Intermodal
         6. Bidfreight Transport
         7. Container Liners Operator Forum
         8. Vigomaud Transport


     B.     Durban Container Terminal (DCT)


         1. Background
              The DCT is situated in a strategic position. There are three
              modes of transport used at DCT - road, rail and coastal
              shipping services. Of the cargo that is handled, 75% moves by
              road, with 40% in the Durban area and 30% to destinations
              beyond Durban. The split of cargo by transport modes is 75%
              road and 22% rail, with the remaining 3% being shipped via
              coastal services.


              DCT handles 65% of the country's container volumes.


              SAPO supports the view of moving cargo from road to rail
              because they strongly maintain that it is easier to load 100
              containers onto a single train than onto 100 individual road
              vehicles.


              Their main concern is the extent to which rail is ready to
              handle the shift. At the present moment there are challenges
              that need to be addressed in order to see the desired shift of
              containerised freight from road to rail.


         2. Constraints facing SAPO


              The constraints facing SAPO include:


              (a) High rate of copper cable theft causing train delays.


              (b) Transit time by rail on the Johannesburg/Durban leg is
                  five to seven days and 24 hours by road.


              (c) There is a shortage of locomotives, causing trains to be
                  delayed in the marshalling yards.


              (d) Theft of cargo occurs while being transported on rail.


              (e) Insufficient interface and compatibility of computer
                  systems, which cause delays in transport due to
                  insufficient information being available. It was claimed
                  that 30% of containers arrive with incorrect information,
                  and 15% of export containers arrive late for their
                  vessels.


              (f) Rail tariffs are higher than road transport rates.


              (g) Shortage of straddle carriers.


              (h) Shortage of wharf-side cranes.


              (i) Capacity of piers and rail terminal.


         3. Solutions


              Solutions to these challenges include:


              (a) More visible security alongside rail tracks in order to
                  curb theft of overhead cables.


              (b) Turnaround times of trains and transit times need to be
                  improved.


              (c) Spoornet and SAPO need to interact more closely to address
                  the current challenges.
              (d) Streamlining of supply chain towards a fully integrated
                  seamless transport system.


              (e) Streamlining of interface with Customers and Spoornet.


              (f) Proposed repositioning of mobile cranes from Richards Bay
                  and the combi terminal.


              (g) Introduction of 60 new straddle carriers by the end of
                  2002.


              (h) Proposed extension of Pier 1, which includes a new small
                  rail terminal.


         4. Freight operators


              When the delegation met with the freight operators, it was
              clear that there was insufficient interaction between
              Spoornet, SAPO and themselves. They alluded to the fact that
              they supported the shift of freight from road to rail but that
              Spoornet and SAPO needed to address the existing challenges
              that impact on the smooth operation of rail.


         5. Constraints


              The freight operators underlined the following constraints:


              (a) Delays in loading/offloading vessels causes additional
                  costs and also causes a shift of freight onto road.


              (b) There is a shortage of locomotives and poor utilisation of
                  rail wagons, including a short supply for the rail of
                  empty containers, which results in congestion and delays.


              (c) Rail tariffs promote the use of road rather than rail.


              (d) There is no synchronisation of operating times between
                  terminals. DCT operates on a 24-hour basis while City
                  Deep operates from 06:00 to 17:00.


              (e) The need for the Department of Transport (DOT) and the
                  Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) to have a common
                  vision regarding the moving of freight from road to rail.


              (f) Slow turn-around of vessels.


              (g) Service Level Agreements (SLA) do not seem to work.
     C.     City Deep and Pretcon Terminals


         1. Background


              According to Spoornet, City Deep was planned specifically as a
              transit terminal for containerisation. It is situated close to
              the industrial areas of Gauteng. City Deep and Pretcon only
              deal with import and export containerised freight. Spoornet
              operates both City Deep and Pretcon terminals, which are
              inland terminals that provide an essential intermodal link
              between road and rail. City Deep handles eight trains per day
              and has the capacity to handle 2 400 containers per day, but
              currently operates at 50% of capacity. Pretcon handles four
              trains per day and has the capacity to handle 1 000 containers
              per day.


              In order to increase container security on rail, rail wagons
              have been modified to prevent container doors from being
              opened. Spoornet has 24-hour security in the marshalling
              yards.


              To make it easier for clients to track and locate their
              containers, Spoornet has designed a website where container
              information can be provided.


         2. Constraints facing Spoornet


              (a) No planned movement of containers from the port to the
                  customer is provided.


              (b) Unplanned storage in the terminals causes congestion.


              (c) There is a lack of communication and information sharing
                  between Spoornet, cargo owners and freight operators.


              (d) Vandalism, crime and theft are a challenge in operating
                  rail.


         3. Freight operators


              All the representatives of private freight operators agreed
              that rail is the best method of transporting containerised
              freight. Their concern was that the current situation was not
              encouraging the use of rail.


         4. Constraints


              (a) Quality of service is poor and not predictable.


              (b) Rail tariffs promote the use of road instead of rail. 65%
                  of City Deep/Pretcon-bound containers are transported by
                  road from the coast.


              (c) There is a lack of capacity at Spoornet.


              (d) Operating hours of inland terminals need to be extended.


              (e) Constant changes in management cause a loss of experienced
                  staff.


              (f) Spoornet needs to invest in new rolling stock and human
                  resources.
              (g) Insufficient law enforcement of road transporters takes
                  place.


              (h) Information on the Spoornet website is often incorrect.


              (i) There is insufficient planning on the part of Spoornet.
              (j) The motor industry volumes have grown by 56%, while the
                  infrastructure has remained the same.


         5. Interaction with Spoornet


              Spoornet alluded to the fact that they do have capacity
              problems. They have monthly meetings with the operators in
              order to address issues which need to be resolved.


              Around the issue of security at City Deep, excellent co-
              operation between Spoornet and the operators had been achieved
              and as a result safety and security have improved
              tremendously.


     D.     Recommendations


         1. Rail transit times and the turnaround of trains need to be
              reduced.


         2. Security needs to be increased along rail lines to curb the
              theft of overhead cables.


         3. Planning and utilisation of rail wagons needs to be improved.


         4. Operating hours of inland terminals should be reviewed.


         5. Rail tariffs need to be reviewed to ensure that they are
              competitive with road transport.


         6. More effective policing of road transporters needs to take
              place.


         7. Service levels need to be reviewed and improved to promote the
              use of rail.


         8. Spoornet and SAPO need to work together as a team to promote
              the use of rail.


         9. Introduce dedicated container trains with locomotives.


         10.     Ensure effective law enforcement on overloaded and under-
              declared containers entering container terminals.
         11.     Labour relations need to be improved to prevent strike-
              related action.


         12.     Communication with customers needs to be improved.


         13.     Rail of export containers needs to be given priority.


         14.     Accuracy of the website needs to be improved.


         15.     Investigate joint venture options with stakeholders.


         16.     Empower middle management to improve decision- making
              processes.


         17.     Make available a copy of the Halcrow recommendations to
              the Committee.


     E.     Acknowledgements


         The Committee wishes extend its gratitude to Transnet for hosting
         the delegation, and also thanks Spoornet, South African Ports
         Operations and all the private freight operators for their
         participation.

3.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry on public
     hearings on Industrial Policy, dated 5 June 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry, together with the Select
     Committee on Economic and Foreign Affairs of the National Council of
     Provinces, held public hearings on industrial policy at Parliament from
     23 April to 7 May 2002. Submissions were invited to address a range of
     issues related to industrial policy and to comment on the discussion
     document of the Department of Trade and Industry, entitled Accelerating
     Growth and Development: The Contribution of the Integrated
     Manufacturing Strategy, which was released in April 2002.


     The Committee reports as follows:


     1.     Introduction


         Submissions and evidence were presented by the following in oral
         and written form:


         Private sector institutions, and individuals

         Government, Public Bodies and Political Parties


         Department and Ministry of Trade and Industry
         Foundation for Education, Science and Technology
         Competition Commission of South Africa
         Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology
         Nedlac
         South African Communist Party
         Motor Industry Development Programme of Department
         Industrial Development Corporation
         Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
         Commission on Gender Equality


         The hearings were held to assess the broad industrial policy
         framework and were not limited to the document released by the
         Department of Trade and Industry entitled Accelerating Growth and
         Development: the Contribution of the Integrated Manufacturing
         Strategy (hereafter referred to as the IMS). The document,
         however, clearly represents an important development in
         government's thinking on industrial policy and much of the
         engagements were centred around the core issues identified in it.
         The release of the document just prior to the hearings
         unfortunately limited the ability of several stakeholders to
         engage with it in detail. The hearings and this Report therefore
         represent an initial basis for ongoing engagement.


         The essence of a manufacturing or industrial strategy is to
         address the existing industrial structure and its implications for
         the possible future development paths of the economy. It should
         outline choices and set out the priorities of government together
         with a co-ordinated plan of the main areas in which actions will
         be taken. South African industry includes sophisticated production
         activities and developed heavy industries but in the last decade
         has failed to create employment, meaning that many engage in
         survivalist activities to make ends meet. Economic participation
         inevitably reflects the historical control over resources along
         the dimensions of race and gender. The challenges for an
         industrial or manufacturing strategy are therefore both great and
         urgent.


         Preliminary comments


         The Committee noted with concern the low level of participation by
         business. This was reflected both in the shallow engagement with
         the country's industrial policy framework by the business
         organisations which did make submissions, and the lack of
         participation by firms and representative organisations at the
         sector level (apart from the textile sector). The withdrawal from
         the hearings of organisations representing black business meant
         that the voice of this important stakeholder was absent from our
         proceedings. The Committee noted the importance of engagement by
         business if the new industrial policy framework is to realise its
         objectives.


         The Committee also noted that while institutions falling within
         the Council of Trade and Industry Institutions (COTII) did make
         general comments on the manufacturing strategy in their
         submissions, in most cases their representations did not address
         the specific roles of their institutions within the new framework.
         The activities of these institutions are self-evidently an
         important and integral part of government's industrial policy
         framework.


         The main themes from the submissions are now outlined, followed by
         the conclusions, which draw together key points on which broad
         consensus emerged and the main tensions which were explored.


     2.     Main themes


         The Committee found that there was broad consensus around the need
         to develop a manufacturing/industrial strategy that sets out key
         objectives and priorities for an industrial development path and
         the role of different groupings in it. There was agreement that
         this means moving beyond dialogue to collective action, and that
         the State has a key leadership role in achieving this.


         There was a high level of agreement that the new draft of the DTI
         policy in the IMS represents a significant advance on the previous
         policy outline produced in May 2001. This is reflected in the
         identification of the main challenges and priorities, and the need
         to move from macroeconomic stability to microeconomic action. The
         step towards customised offerings for the pursuit of strategic
         goals was also welcomed. As such, it is believed that the
         framework provides a solid basis from which to proceed.


         This Report now outlines the DTI submission and the main
         industrial policy themes raised in the hearings, with reference to
         the various submissions made. The main areas of tensions where
         further analysis and debate are required, are highlighted.


         DTI submission - An Integrated Manufacturing Strategy, and
         Microeconomic Reform Programme


         The DTI submission was based on its document, Accelerating Growth
         and Development: The contribution of the Integrated Manufacturing
         Strategy, which is linked to the Microeconomic Reform Strategy,
         also tabled by the DTI during the hearings. The IMS provides the
         basis for "a collective government position...[to] co-ordinate a
         set of actions across government". It also provides guidance as to
         what "economic citizens can expect from the DTI over the next few
         years".


         A strategy is defined in the IMS as a "long-term plan for future
         success or development". It therefore implies anticipation of the
         future and how it may be influenced, which in turn necessitates
         the collection and analysis of information, and the co-ordination
         of actions (as part of having a coherent plan). As such, the IMS
         is a crucial platform on which to build a collective approach to
         achieve the goals of employment generation and broad-based, more
         equitable, growth.


         The Microeconomic Reform Strategy sets out a vision for 2014 for
         "a restructured and adaptive economy characterised by growth,
         employment and equity, built on the full potential of all persons,
         communities and geographic areas". The requirements to realise
         this vision include:


         *  A geographic spread of social and productive investment


         *  An integrated manufacturing economy capable of high degrees of
              value added


         *  An extensive ICT and logistics system capable of speed and
              flexibility


         *  A high degree of knowledge and technology capacity


         *  Greater diversity of enterprise type and size


         *  Skilled, informed and adaptable citizens


         *  An efficient, strong and responsive state structure


         The strategy identifies the challenges in terms of the dualistic
         nature of South Africa's economy. It therefore seeks the
         improvement of cost-competitiveness in the developed economy, and
         the realisation of potential in the underdeveloped part of the
         economy, which represents the experiences of a large proportion of
         South Africans.


         The performance of the South African economy is a starting point
         for the microeconomic reform strategy as well as for several
         submissions. This performance is characterised by weak growth,
         declining investment and savings rates, low levels of investment
         in research and development, falling formal employment and high
         levels of unemployment, especially among black people and women
         across racial groups. These characteristics are manifested in, and
         reflect, the high levels of inequality and poverty.
         The strategy is an important part of the integrated action plan
         announced by President Mbeki in February 2001. This plan outlines
         the need for co-ordinated government interventions. Areas which
         are highlighted, include technology, human resource development,
         access to finance and infrastructure.


         The DTI approach identifies competitiveness (required for
         increased production and employment) as having to do with a range
         of factors which impact on the ability of firms to produce and
         sell products. These include the prices of inputs, infrastructure,
         technology and innovation, skills and effective regulation.
         Central to the impetus for growth in this approach is improved
         efficiency through integration with the international economy and
         increased knowledge intensity. Technology, innovation and
         information communication technology (ICT) are emphasised as major
         drivers in this strategy. This is contrasted particularly with the
         past reliance on natural resources and cheap unskilled labour for
         competitiveness.


         The DTI proposes a framework of value matrices for addressing the
         vertical and horizontal relationships involved in increasing value
         added across sectors, and the links with areas such as
         agriculture, beneficiation, ICT and tourism. Eight sectors are
         identified for promotion using customised services: clothing and
         textiles, agro-processing, metals and minerals, tourism,
         automotive and transport, crafts, chemical and biotechnology, and
         knowledge-intensive services. The DTI will also continue to pursue
         broad-based programmes related to competitive market access, the
         regulatory environment, investment promotion, access to finance,
         and policy coherence.


         The key performance areas are black economic empowerment, small
         business development, employment and the geographic spread of
         economic activity. Targets are to be set, with an effective
         monitoring and evaluation framework to be put in place.


         In its response to the hearings, the DTI argued that South Africa
         was already well on the way to becoming a knowledge economy and
         that the promotion of knowledge-driven activities, such as
         innovation and marketing intelligence, were a key to further
         development in all sectors. The Department also argued that a
         knowledge economy needs to draw on the experiences and capacities
         of everyone, and that in this context one of the major challenges
         was to more effectively upgrade the skills and capacities of our
         people, many of whom were at present not just unemployed but
         lacked the skills to take up employment.


         The key themes raised by the DTI's submission were the focus of
         much of the debate around the subsequent submissions, and they
         were returned to in the response of the DTI at the end of the
         hearings.


         Manufacturing strategy, industrial policy and industrial strategy


         The DTI places manufacturing at the centre of the economy, and
         emphasises the need to increase value addition. The strategy also
         incorporates the need to promote diverse areas such as the
         beneficiation of natural resources and tourism. There was broad
         agreement on the need to examine linkages between cross-cutting
         areas, such as ICT, and the development of different sectors of
         the economy. This did, however, raise the question as to whether
         industrial strategy is not a more appropriate term as it connotes
         the influencing of different industries' development paths in line
         with national socio-economic priorities. These are not limited to
         sectors which are clearly delineated in economic terms as
         constituting manufacturing. This is also consistent with
         industrial policies as being the set of interventions to realise a
         particular vision for industrial restructuring.


         Role of State: from dialogue to collective action


         The need for a coherent plan to take collective actions forward to
         implementation is a core element of the strategy. The DTI
         submission clearly articulates that they act as a facilitator for
         the Microeconomic Reform Strategy and will champion
         competitiveness and equity in the economy. This they aim to do
         through partnerships in designing the interventions required. The
         emphasis on a stronger state leadership role was widely welcomed,
         to ensure the move beyond dialogue is achieved. The rationale for
         leadership is based on the intrinsic features of the South African
         economy, rather than a narrower understanding of state action
         being limited to addressing "market failures".


         Submissions from Nedlac and the various social partners noted that
         the experience of collective engagements indicates that there are
         three key factors for success. First is the power of
         constituencies to drive the issue in question and to follow
         through. Second is leadership and constituencies' capacity to act,
         in particular government. Third is the sharing of information.
         Experiences of weaknesses across all constituencies were noted by
         Nedlac. However, particular concerns exist around the
         fragmentation of business. These concerns include difficulties in
         getting mandated positions and the weak capacity of small and
         medium business to effectively engage on key policy issues.


         In this regard, the DTI noted that their ability to move forward
         with collective actions would depend on the coming together of
         different stakeholders within sectors to move beyond narrow
         interests and lobbying to concrete analysis of the challenges and
         mapping out of the future development path. Sector job summits
         needed to fulfil this role if they were to be a mechanism for
         determining collective action in industrial policy.


         The relative success of the Motor Industry Development Programme
         was contrasted with other sectors such as clothing and textiles.
         These examples highlight the importance of well-organised
         constituencies, such as in the motor sector. But, if a
         developmental industrial policy is to be taken forward which meets
         the objectives outlined by the DTI, such as employment creation,
         increased participation and equity, then the constituencies which
         should benefit most are not necessarily those which are strongest.
         This further emphasises the key leadership role of government in
         co-ordinating and delivering on agreed actions, and in not being
         limited to a reactive role to the demands coming from sectors.


         The differences between sectors also highlights the importance of
         taking sector specific characteristics into account in the more
         targeted approach adopted in the strategy. The design and
         implementation of customised services by the DTI and the value
         matrices framework enable these sector specific factors to be
         carried through into appropriate measures. This was widely
         welcomed.


         The roles of parastatals such as the IDC and other institutions
         across government must be part of a co-ordinated approach. In this
         regard, while the IDC has evidently played a leading role in large-
         scale beneficiation projects, which would not have taken place
         without its participation, there is concern as to progress in
         other areas. For example, IDC activity in small and medium
         enterprise finance appears to be largely reactive.


         The weak representation at the hearings of other institutions
         within the Council of Trade and Industry Institutions (COTII) is
         of concern, given the need for effective co-ordination. Indeed,
         this is also an area of the DTI strategy where almost no detail is
         provided, and yet it aspires to lay the foundation for an
         integrated and co-ordinated framework. As the DTI itself notes in
         the strategy, the co-ordination and oversight of the COTII is "a
         significant challenge to the DTI and requires that DTI be equipped
         with the requisite capacities to meet this challenge".


         Clarity on the process of further engagement to develop the
         strategy is required. It was noted by Nedlac and the
         constituencies that the engagement to date had been on the
         previous version of the strategy released by the DTI in May 2001.


         Exports and trade liberalisation


         Exports are identified by the DTI as a target sector in its own
         right. Export performance and potential is also one of the grounds
         for identifying specific value chains for promotion. The DTI
         further argues that exports have been encouraged by trade
         liberalisation and that sectors with improved export performance
         have also recorded better performance in terms of employment.
         Other submissions, including those by Cosatu and affiliates,
         question this. Data on manufacturing sectors indicates that the
         best performing export sectors in recent years have recorded
         employment losses. And, sectors recording the largest net
         increases in jobs (plastics and wood products) have not had
         particularly strong export performance.


         While there was consensus that export competitiveness is an
         important aspect for improved industrial performance, the causal
         links do not appear unambiguous. The recently released UNCTAD
         Trade and Development Report 2002 explains why significantly
         increased exports by developing countries in the past two decades
         has not produced the same improvements in growth. Even in hi-tech
         exports, the production activities being located in developing
         countries are often limited to assembly operations, with
         multinational corporations being attracted by low wages and
         investment incentives. Indeed, there is a risk of a "race to the
         bottom", with countries competing with each other as an investment
         location by offering incentives, competing on lower wages, and
         compromising labour standards. As long as developing countries
         remain in activities at the bottom of the value chain, exports may
         not contribute significantly to growth. In addition, the "fallacy
         of composition" means that if countries are following similar
         approaches it will be self-defeating - what works for one country
         will not necessarily work for many as an oversupply of an exported
         product will lead to falling prices in world markets.


         While the liberalisation of trade has been linked to the
         imperatives of globalisation, submissions by the South African
         Communist Party and trade unions argued strongly that the
         different processes subsumed under the heading of globalisation
         have tendencies to reinforcing marginalisation. The outcomes
         therefore depend on the nature of engagement with these processes.
         For example, export performance is not a short-hand for success in
         industrialisation. It is possible to have improved export
         performance without increased production or employment, as has
         been the case in metals products, highlighted in the submission of
         NUMSA. Increased imports have gone hand-in-hand with increased
         exports. Import penetration in metal products has been most marked
         in the engineering and foundry products subsector, meaning that a
         tendency to more basic processing has been reinforced rather than
         the increased beneficiation which is an objective of the
         manufacturing strategy. Links between exports and technology are
         similarly not straightforward and need to be understood in more
         detail.


         Trade liberalisation has forced companies to compete with imports
         and improve efficiency levels. At issue is the nature of the
         restructuring responses of firms and the costs in terms of
         employment and production. In particular, concerns were raised
         about the adequacy and sequencing of support measures for
         industries. Growth-oriented restructuring requires high levels of
         investment to increase productive capabilities and expand
         employment. With the relatively low levels of investment which
         have prevailed, firms in sectors such as textiles have upgraded
         machinery and raised productivity but in the context of static
         production, yielding reductions in employment. In the motor
         vehicle sector, measures designed to address the specific
         restructuring requirements in that sector have had a greater
         measure of success.


         Rather than a false dichotomy being drawn between exports and the
         domestic market, an alternative emphasis proposed by Labour and
         the SACP is for a developmental strategy underpinning
         competitiveness - where links between domestic demand, meeting
         basic needs and production are developed rather than a narrow
         focus on exports. For example, products such as fridges are
         primarily oriented to the domestic market. There are also linkages
         between products such as metal pipes and tubes and infrastructure
         investment.


         Technology, knowledge intensity, and research and development


         There was broad agreement over the worrying implications of the
         decline in research and development expenditure in the economy to
         around 0,7% of GDP (compared with the 2% commonly targeted by
         industrialising countries). There was also agreement over the need
         to recognise the increasing application of information and
         communication technologies to production, and the need to improve
         South Africa's skills base, especially in science, engineering and
         technology related disciplines. The DTI places increasing
         knowledge intensity at the centre of the manufacturing strategy as
         perhaps the prime driver of growth. This is founded on the belief
         that "Old Ways Don't Work" anymore, such as strategies based on
         raw materials or labour costs. Instead it is the development and
         application of "knowledge intensity" and ICT that are viewed as
         key for the development of "integrated value matrices". The
         response of the DTI to submissions re-emphasised their view that
         economic participation required appropriate skills for the new
         economy.


         Strong submissions by the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and
         Technology (DACST), the Foundation for Education, Science and
         Technology (a DACST agency) and the CSIR further developed the
         issues of research and development (R&D) and the application of
         technology. These reinforced the need to have a clear strategic
         understanding of developments in this area. The R&D policy
         framework being developed by DACST will complement the IMS, while
         the CSIR is engaged in a range of concrete initiatives. The
         development of such strategies is evidently of importance, as the
         reductions in R&D expenditure in recent years are exactly the
         opposite of what is required for the DTI's strategy.


         The causes of lower R&D expenditure were identified in the
         submissions as to do with both the private and public sectors. In
         both cases, however, the absence of a clear set of priorities for
         industrial development is an important factor. Public sector
         expenditure has declined largely as a result of shifts away from
         the apartheid priorities, without a redirection of efforts to
         priorities identified for broad-based and more equitable
         development. In the private sector, the competitive pressures of
         liberalisation have led to firms cutting costs, including research
         budgets. The "hollowing out" of corporate research has also been
         linked to the acquisitions of South African firms by multinational
         companies whose research capacity is situated primarily in their
         home base. In extreme cases, the multinational companies have
         closed significant production capabilities in South Africa and
         used the South African subsidiary as an assembly and "warehousing"
         operation for mainly imported components and products. It is worth
         noting that it is precisely the application of ICT which enables
         the more effective control by multinationals of operations in
         different countries. Gains from the technologies of globalisation
         therefore require a clear strategy of engagement. The counter-
         example of Sasol - with very high local research investments -
         illustrates the importance of domestic capabilities, and the
         possible results of State action.


         It was also emphasised that it is the application of technology
         and R&D which is the objective and not higher R&D activities for
         their own sake. Developing countries typically have a higher
         proportion of R&D spending undertaken by government. Examples were
         given of Korea (with a manufacturing leadership focus), Malaysia
         (aiming to be a fast-follower in the effective application of
         technologies, rather than primary research) and Australia (with an
         explicit focus on resources and agriculture). In this context, it
         is evidently important to avoid portraying the strategy as a
         choice between either resource beneficiation or knowledge
         intensity - the application of technologies is important for
         increased beneficiation and value added. The strategy being
         formulated by DACST has three focus areas: achieving mastery of
         technological change in the economy; increasing investment in
         South Africa's science base; and strengthening and realigning the
         science and technology machinery of government. At present, the
         research community is predominantly white, and aging, with
         research areas that reflect the previous government's priorities.


         According to DACST the local research community at present
         communicates mainly with overseas research groupings. South
         African firms also communicate mainly with overseas producers for
         technologies. Apart from notable exceptions, such as Sasol, there
         is therefore an "innovation chasm" between local research and its
         application in local production. Application of technology also
         requires increased investment expenditures in new and more
         advanced machinery and equipment. This is easier to achieve in an
         expansionary environment.


         Submissions by both labour and industry emphasised that, rather
         than treating technology independently, it must be linked into the
         wider issues of the strategies of firms and their investment and
         training decisions. Technology is not inherently biased to
         different segments of the economy. Its application can yield very
         significant gains in rural and small-scale economic activities,
         and can therefore contribute to increasing integration of the
         South African economy rather than fragmentation. But, application
         in these areas requires government leadership to a greater degree
         as there are economies of scale in research activities and upfront
         costs which make R&D less likely in smaller entities. In addition,
         while the gains to the economy as a whole are potentially very
         large, the financial rewards to an individual enterprise may not
         appear to be large (and therefore an incentive to invest in
         research activities).


         Similar issues were raised by the CSIR submission and subsequent
         deliberations by the Committee. While the many areas of consensus
         with the DTI strategy were highlighted, the CSIR's focus was on
         the need to view technology as a process from development through
         to application as part of enterprises' production strategies and
         employment decisions. There is a need to identify key issues
         within selected industries and related to key technologies, and to
         design interventions. Identification of these will be enhanced by
         business intelligence at both a global level and on domestic value
         matrices, which needs to be made available to the organisations
         with responsibilities in the field. Similarly linkages between
         initiatives such as Industrial Development Zones and Spatial
         Development Initiatives need to be spelt out.
         Initiatives such as the Auto Industry Development Centre and the
         Light Metals Development Centre in which the CSIR is engaged along
         with firms and other institutions provide examples of partnership
         in practice. However, the need to raise the majority of its funds
         from fees charged to the private sector raises questions as to the
         effectiveness of the CSIR in its role of proactively "leading"
         developments that are in line with national priorities and the
         future development path, rather than "following" private firms. In
         most industrialising countries. Research to support long-term
         priorities is given much greater state support in order to provide
         services as a "public good". For example, the USA's programmes in
         defence and space provide major support to industries engaged in
         areas such as materials development. More effective use of the
         CSIR as a public institution could be viewed as it constituting a
         major supply-side measure.


         Investment patterns and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)


         There was broad consensus about the poor investment performance in
         recent years, and the need for the investment rate to be
         significantly higher if stronger growth and employment generation
         are to be attained. Both Business and Labour submissions argued
         that more effective co-ordination of government activities across
         different departments and public institutions was necessary for
         higher investment rates. There was also widespread agreement that
         poor investment performance was due to the decisions of private
         firms rather than a lack of funds. Low levels of investment by
         government and parastatals in the last decade was noted as one of
         the factors underlying low investment rates in the economy.


         There was also consensus that foreign direct investment is
         attracted to economies which are growing rather than FDI being the
         catalyst for growth. The potential threats from FDI in the form of
         mergers and acquisitions were highlighted by several submissions
         by trade unions. In both the metals and dairy sectors there have
         been cases of foreign acquisitions leading to South African
         subsidiaries being converted into "warehousing" operations for
         imported products. The failure to realise the benefits to the
         South African economy from foreign listings was also noted.


         The Business submissions put forward a general platform arguing
         for lower taxes and privatisation rather than engaging with the
         implications for industrial policy specifically. Submissions by
         the SACP and Labour argued for the need to understand the patterns
         of capital accumulation and investment decisions as part of
         evolving corporate strategies. Given widespread market failures in
         financial markets there is a need to ensure that public
         development finance institutions, especially the Industrial
         Development Corporation, are oriented towards industrial
         development goals. Government infrastructure investment, including
         in spatial development initiatives, also has an important role in
         crowding-in private investment. By providing greater certainty as
         to future developments in these areas, government also reduces
         perceptions of risk around investment decisions by private firms.


         The need to explore measures such as prescribed assets to ensure
         that financial resources are deployed to long-term growth
         objectives was also raised by Labour and the SACP, both of whom
         also saw a need to underpin industrial policy with a comprehensive
         restructuring of the financial sector.


         Pricing of inputs and import-parity pricing


         The DTI strategy raises the pricing of inputs as an important area
         for government attention, with particular reference to services
         such as transport and telecommunications. The Competition
         Commission and others also noted the negative implications of
         import-parity pricing for the development of broad-based
         manufacturing, but few details were provided on actions in this
         area. Import-parity pricing is widely practised and effectively
         means that there are no cost advantages for manufacturing firms
         using South African produced material inputs as they have to pay
         prices equivalent to the costs of importing (including the
         transport, tariffs and related costs that they would have to
         incur). This price may be significantly above the price which
         South African producers are charging in the export market. A value
         chain approach, which examines linkages between different stages
         of processing from raw materials through to finished products
         could address such issues, provided concrete mechanisms are in
         place to enforce remedies.


         Empowerment and participation


         The poor progress in black economic empowerment is highlighted in
         the IMS, as is the lack of progress in ensuring equitable
         participation by women, with black rural women in particular
         bearing the brunt of ongoing poverty. A four-pronged approach is
         to be adopted towards black economic empowerment including new
         offerings, a partnership programme and a non-statutory black
         economic empowerment advisory council. Support measures and access
         to finance will be designed to increase the participation in the
         economy of black people and women. Other submissions noted the
         importance of integrating meaningful empowerment measures into
         government's industrial strategy. The Labour submission noted the
         need to adopt a broad definition of empowerment that extended
         beyond increased ownership to effective participation of the mass
         of the population.


         The lack of effective treatment of relationships between gender
         and industrial strategy in the various submissions was, however,
         highlighted by Committee members. As noted by the Commission on
         Gender Equality, the roles of women are influenced by traditional
         and modern practices of patriarchy which include access to
         economic assets such as finance and land. The continuing gender
         division of labour means that women (and black women in
         particular) tend to work in lower paid and less secure employment,
         as well as undertaking unpaid work in the household. The gender
         division of labour is integrally linked to the development path of
         the economy and continuing high levels of poverty.


         Industrial restructuring has evident effects on women, and their
         participation in the economy. This applies to patterns of
         employment and unemployment and, for example, the effects of
         increased practices of casualisation and outsourcing in sectors
         such as clothing and retail. Concerns raised by the Commission on
         Gender Equality include: the need to be more explicit in the
         definition of beneficiaries; ensuring that strategies designed for
         sectors under customised programmes promote the development of
         industries in a transformative manner; and that women's
         organisation need to be taken more into account in economic
         decision-making. There are implications for measures addressed at
         micro-enterprises, small firms and co-operatives, access to
         training, participation in policy formulation, elimination of
         occupational segregation, and the monitoring of policy impacts.


         HIV/AIDS


         Union research indicates that there are already effects being felt
         of HIV/AIDS on skilled categories of workers. There are also
         indications through unions' networks of shop-stewards that
         businesses are changing their decisions to take account of the
         perceived impacts of HIV/AIDS on purchasing patterns. That is,
         producers in sectors such as food and furniture are moving away
         from basic goods for low-income markets based on the belief that
         HIV/AIDS will mean declining demand in these market segments.


         The Motor Industry Development Programme
         The Motor Industry Development Programme (MIDP) was initiated in
         1996 based on an analysis of the key challenges facing the auto
         sector and was a result of industry and government agreement. It
         is viewed as a major success by DTI on the grounds that it has
         succeeded in stimulating exports, and preventing major employment
         losses. The auto firms have restructured to reduce the numbers of
         different models assembled in South Africa and have increased the
         volumes of those models which are produced and local component
         production. The main feature which has encouraged the
         restructuring is the rebate of import duties from the export of
         vehicles and components.


         An important element of the programme is the integrative effects
         along the value chain. These arise from the groupings established,
         namely the Motor Industry Development Council of the main
         stakeholders, the MIDP as the main programme, the Strategic
         Investment Team which proactively identifies investment
         opportunities in components, the Auto Industry Development Council
         which links research, training, investment and corporate
         strategies, and the "benchmarking clubs" which have been
         established to support components producers.


         A key reason identified for the success of the programme is the
         leadership exerted by firms (especially the main German
         assemblers) and by government. The take-up of government support
         measures indicates the importance of a co-ordinated sector
         strategy for the effectiveness of government initiatives. In
         addition, through the Strategic Investment Team, potential
         developments are anticipated at the industry level through
         collective information sharing and links with government policies.
         Government exerts leverage through its specific programmes such as
         the Critical Infrastructure Fund.


         Rather than being transplanted directly to other sectors, the
         lessons from comparisons with sectors such as clothing and
         textiles are that measures must be based on an understanding of
         the sector-specific challenges and that the commitment of the
         different constituencies to a commonly agreed set of concrete
         objectives is crucial. Questions were also raised about the
         concentration on a very small set of components exports (catalytic
         converters, seat-leather and exhausts) and the relatively limited
         employment creation as a result.


         Agro-processing and food production


         Submissions by the Food and Allied Workers Union (FAWU) and the
         National Labour and Economic Development Institute (Naledi) noted
         that deregulation and liberalisation mean that prices of food
         products in South Africa are now determined in international
         markets. This means that prices can fluctuate greatly from year to
         year and speculation may exacerbate the volatility of prices, such
         as when news of possible developments in other countries has a
         major impact on the prices of staple foodstuffs for low-income
         consumers.


         It was also noted that trade agreements, such as with the European
         Union, have not yielded the expected gains. Studies have
         questioned whether overall impact for the South African economy
         will be positive, especially as the opening of the EU market to
         South African produce has been much slower than anticipated for a
         variety of reasons. The ongoing (and in some cases, increasing)
         subsidisation of agriculture in industrialised countries is also
         cause for concern.


         Small, medium and micro enterprises


         The IMS notes the significance of small, micro and medium
         enterprises in the economy and identifies reductions in barriers
         facing their operations as a priority for empowerment. Measures to
         achieve this are to include a one-stop shop for entrepreneurs for
         access to finance, and attention to market access and unfair
         competition.


         The submission by the Small Business Project proposed the need for
         a regulatory review to examine the ways in which regulations
         inhibited the growth of SMMEs. The submission also highlighted the
         lack of a clear plan and concrete measures for SMMEs in the IMS.
         Committee members noted the importance of viewing SMME development
         against the legacy of apartheid and the need for proactive
         government measures, including promoting greater access to
         affordable finance, in order to empower SMMEs to contribute to
         more equitable growth. It was noted by Labour representations that
         SMMEs did, however, tend to have a shorter-term focus and were
         therefore less likely to make investments in machinery and skills
         development required for long-term growth.


         Subcontracting, outsourcing and casualisation


         There has undoubtedly been a major increase in subcontracting and
         outsourcing by firms. This has ambiguous effects which need to be
         analysed. At one level, these processes may lead to increased
         participation by SMMEs owned by historically disadvantaged
         persons. However, there are a number of negative effects. The
         increased flexibility and increased insecurity resulting from such
         arrangements conflicts with a greater emphasis on R&D and skills
         development. Evidence was also presented in the written submission
         by Skinner and Valodia on the clothing sector in KwaZulu-Natal.
         Skinner and Valodia's research found that firms are using
         outsourcing arrangements simply to by-pass labour regulations and
         health and safety requirements on a very large-scale. As such,
         these practices may simply be exploitative.


     3.     Conclusions and recommendations


         The DTI's Integrated Manufacturing Strategy is undoubtedly a major
         advance in developing an appropriate industrial policy to reorient
         the economy to achieve the objectives of broad-based growth,
         employment generation and equity. In it the leadership role for
         the state is clearly established. The challenge is to take this
         leadership through to effective strategies at the sector level,
         through the collection and analysis of information, design of
         appropriate customised measures and co-ordination of the actions
         of different government departments and institutions. The urgency
         of these measures cannot be in doubt given the large job losses
         which have been sustained across industrial sectors.


         There was broad consensus from the hearings that the value matrix
         framework was a useful approach for understanding the vertical and
         horizontal linkages between activities, within and across value
         chains. Similarly, a strong understanding of the various
         relationships between knowledge-intensity, beneficiation,
         investment, the financial sector (including the issue of promoting
         greater access to affordable finance by SMMEs) and increased
         participation in the economy is crucial for development and
         successful implementation of the strategy.


         There was also consensus on the importance of effective collective
         action, led by the state, with customised measures based on the
         specific needs of different sectors. In addition, the focus on
         research and development and the effective application of
         technology to improve production capabilities is welcome to
         reverse the declines in investment in these areas.


         There are also a range of tensions which reflect the realities of
         the South African economy. These tensions include that between the
         requirements of international competitiveness in established
         manufacturing industries, and the need to create employment and
         increase the participation of the mass of the population who are
         unemployed or under-employed. A similar tension exists between the
         emphasis on exports and production for the local market. It is
         important to note that submissions and subsequent debate in the
         hearings did not view these tensions as representing alternative
         choices. The high levels of poverty and unemployment are partly a
         result of the previous industrial policies which simultaneously
         supported the development of certain industries. And, meeting the
         imperatives to broaden access to resources, for example, in
         finance, education and infrastructure, is necessary to ensure the
         sustainable development of future productive capabilities.


         Nor was it argued that exports and local production are mutually
         exclusive. Export capabilities depend on investment and productive
         capabilities which are founded on local economic strengths.
         Increased integration in the domestic economy through better
         infrastructure provision, affordable access, improved education
         and skills development, is a key part of the platform for
         sustained industrial growth and will be supported by an effective
         set of industrial policies. The application of knowledge also does
         not intrinsically mean a focus on only one segment of the economy.
         Indeed, without developing and applying knowledge appropriate to
         economic activities across the economy increased economic
         integration will not be achieved and high levels of inequality
         will be perpetuated. This relates to the concrete measures in
         implementing the industrial strategy, and the activities of
         institutions such as the CSIR and IDC.


         Arising from the hearings and the Committee's deliberations are
         the following recommendations:


         *  Further clarification is required as to how the value matrix
              framework is to be applied in practice.


         *  There is a need for further clarity on the precise mechanisms
              through which DTI will seek to promote more effective
              collective action, including how to overcome impediments
              identified by participants in the hearings.


         *  There is an urgent need to build capacity in the DTI to analyse
              the determinants of industrial development within and across
              sectors, and to design and implement appropriate policy
              measures.


         *  More effective co-ordination around the implementation of the
              IMS is required between different branches of government such
              as DACST and DTI, and between institutions within COTII. The
              challenge facing the COTII institutions is not merely to
              comment in general on the IMS document, but to identify in
              detail how their own activities will contribute to the
              advancement of the strategy. The Committee accepts the point
              made in the Department's response that they too have an active
              role to play in ensuring the implementation of the strategy
              through, inter alia, "interrogating the mandates and
              activities" of the COTII institutions, and through the role
              they play in "debating and questioning all legislation that
              the DTI and other economic departments table".


         *  The role of the IDC needs to be addressed in greater detail, as
              part of assessing the ways in which the IMS can impact on
              investment patterns and empowerment. In particular, the IDC's
              operations in the SME sector and in empowerment must be
              reoriented to enable it more effectively to "identify and
              support opportunities not yet addressed by the market", just
              as it has historically done in large-scale upstream
              beneficiation.


         *  Specific measures to increase research and development
              activities in South Africa, including additional direct
              funding by government, are urgently needed. Serious
              consideration should be given to the proposal by the CSIR to
              make R&D support a component of customised support packages
              made available by government to support the IMS. A particular
              focus needs to be the development of technologies appropriate
              to the challenges of development and the promotion of
              employment.


         *  Visible and concrete benefits from the industrial strategy must
              be realised in underdeveloped and rural areas of the economy.


         *  The promotion of cooperatives and other forms of collectively
              owned enterprises needs to be fostered and encouraged as a
              major component of SMME and empowerment strategies.


         *  There is a need to take empowerment into account in more
              concrete terms and particularly to address the absence of a
              substantive treatment of gender. In this respect, the
              recommendations of the Commission for Gender Equality to
              engender the IMS merit careful consideration. There is a need,
              in particular, for customised support programmes to take
              account of the current gender profiles and problems in
              promoting gender equality that are specific to industries or
              sectors to which they are applied.


         *  The roles of different levels of government in industrial
              strategy must be determined. The effectiveness of many
              measures, such as linkages with infrastructure provision and
              the operation of industrial development zones, lie in the
              hands of provincial and local government and municipalities.
              It is therefore necessary to ensure a high level of co-
              ordination between a national IMS and the policies and
              programmes of provinces and local governments. The Committee
              recommends that as part of the ongoing process of
              consultation, particular steps are taken to engage with the
              provincial and municipal spheres of government, as well as
              with other stakeholders operating at these levels.


         The Committee welcomes the interaction and look forward to further
         debate and engagement in order to strengthen the industrial policy
         framework. In particular, the Committee will seek to promote
         further discussion and debate on implementation of industrial
         policy as well as on the interrelationship between industrial
         policy and:
         *  The development of a supportive macroeconomic framework


         *  Measures to promote greater access to affordable finance for
              development


         *  Empowerment and Training Programmes


         *  Further extending the State's developmental role, including
              that of parastatals


         The Committee wishes to thank all those who made submissions, as
         well as the European Union Parliamentary Support Programme, which
         made available financial assistance for research support.
