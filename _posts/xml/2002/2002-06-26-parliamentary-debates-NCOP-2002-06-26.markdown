              MINERAL AND PETROLEUM RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Economic and
                          Foreign Affairs thereon)

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, on a point of order: It  is  my  contention  that
the select committee sat as a joint committee  with  the  National  Assembly
portfolio committee. It is further my  contention  that  the  Rules  require
both Houses to authorise such a resolution passed in the House.

In the light of the fact that the Constitution  confers  on  us  a  role  to
review legislation, specifically section 75 legislation  that  comes  before
this House, we should maintain our independence and not condone lightly  any
abrogation of that by simply sitting as a joint committee  when  and  if  it
suits people. I understand that the hearing of submissions or  evidence  may
change the situation, but ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Order!  What  is  your  point  of  order,  hon
member?

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, my point is that the select  committee  therefore
has not sufficiently applied its mind to this independently of the  National
Assembly committee. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, please,  let  us  hear  the
member. I will then decide whether I need to call Mr Moosa,  Ms  Dlulane  or
any other member. This is a democratic institution. Let us allow the  member
an opportunity. Proceed, Mr Lever.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, despite the fact that a rushed meeting  was  held
this morning to rush through the various chapters,  and  that  there  was  a
short briefing, chapter by chapter, by the department, it is my view  and  I
respectfully submit that  that  is  insufficient  to  say  that  the  select
committee has independently applied its mind to the legislation before  this
House.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Lever,  you  did  not  refer  to  the
particular Rules that you are addressing in this  instance.  You  have  made
reference to  joint  meetings  and  that  these  should  not  be  undertaken
lightly. As  far  as  I  am  aware,  there  have  not  been  joint  meetings
sanctioned by this House. What has occurred is that  I  as  the  Chairperson
have acted in terms of Rules 207, 208 and 209 of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces. On that basis,  on  receiving  the  referral  from  the  National
Assembly of this particular piece of legislation, I have asked  that  it  be
placed on the Order Paper. In terms of section 75 legislation and the  Rules
of the NCOP - which are the rules that govern  our  sitting  here;  not  the
Joint Rules - I have taken those actions. I therefore call on  the  hon  the
Minister to address the House. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Madam Chair, hon members, I am here  to
let this House know that we have come this far in the  process  of  changing
our mining industry, and to request the support of this House to  pass  this
Bill.

In my speech today,  as  I  did  in  the  National  Assembly,  I  intend  to
communicate the willingness of my department to  work  with  everybody  with
whom we have otherwise been seen to be quarrelling during the  time  leading
up to this  Bill.  We  believe  that  the  building  of  this  country,  and
particularly turning this industry into a sunrise industry, has always  been
a shared vision of all stakeholders, especially the tripartite.  Making  the
mining industry a sunrise industry is our quest and it is  a  joint  project
that involves all stakeholders, including the members in this House.

Exactly 47 years ago on this day in 1955,  in  Kliptown,  the  ANC  declared
that ``the people shall share in the country's wealth''. Today once more  we
bring that clause of the Freedom Charter to life; we bring  sharing  in  the
country's mineral  wealth  to  small  and  established  companies,  artesian
miners, small miners and all our investors, foreign and  local.  The  wisdom
of our leadership, as demonstrated in Kliptown, has once more  shown  itself
to be timeless. It is still relevant today. It is a pity  that  we  did  not
achieve this earlier, but it is not too late to submit.

Let me take hon members into our confidence about  the  road  that  we  have
travelled. Those who have eagerly and impatiently waited  for  decades  have
argued in their submissions that the Bill  does  not  go  far  enough.  Yet,
those who feel that the Government has gone too far have  objected  to  some
provisions of the Bill. There are  yet  others  who  feel  that  this  is  a
perfect piece of legislation. I include myself among those.

Even yesterday, Madam Chair witnessed how overjoyed  the  National  Assembly
was about the fact that we had tabled this Bill. The  support  and  emotions
that this Bill has aroused can never be erased from my mind.  We  have  been
able to get support from business, notwithstanding the  fact  that  we  have
differed with some from the business sector. However, in general we  believe
that our business sector, which is very modern and experienced in  operating
in other economies, is by and large supportive of this Bill. Of  course,  we
have the support of workers, NGOs, women, academics and our counterparts  in
other parts of the world, who have assisted us as  we  have  travelled  this
road.

Between all these contradictions, I feel that  we  have  reached  sufficient
consensus, which is typical of us in South Africa. It has taken  us  a  long
time to get here, from 1994 when the ANC released  the  discussion  document
on minerals and energy policy, to the time  in  1998  when  Minister  Maduna
tabled the White Paper on Minerals, which  was  then  adopted.  In  November
2000, Cabinet approved the draft minerals development Bill, which  was  then
released for public comment.

I am repeating all this because there are people who are trying to give  the
impression that this is something that we have just  done  overnight.  Those
who accuse us of rushing through this Bill have simply not been doing  their
work. It means that they have not been attending to the  activities  of  the
committees, or that in their party caucuses this has not  been  a  priority.
Maybe that is so because they did not have anything to change. Those  of  us
who felt it a real imperative to bring about change, have paid attention  to
this for the past 10 years, which was a long period.

Those who have been excluded from meaningful involvement  in  this  industry
have waited for generations, over a century, for this day,  and  they  think
that it has been too slow. At the  same  time,  those  who  had  access  and
therefore dominated involvement  in  this  industry  still  remain  valuable
contributors. So, this Bill is also meant for them.

The members of the committee in this House  and  the  chairperson,  together
with their colleagues in the National Assembly, have  worked  very  hard  to
bring us to this stage, and I would like to thank  them.  I  would  like  to
thank the leadership, Mr Mohseen who had  sleepless  nights,  and  the  team
which has made it possible for us to arrive at this day.

We remain convinced of the  importance  of  the  Bill,  notwithstanding  the
public positions we have all taken at different points in dealing  with  the
Bill. We are also dealing with experienced miners and mine owners  who  have
already experienced the changes that this  Bill  seeks  to  bring  about  in
other  countries.  Therefore,  even  though  some  aspects  of  the  current
dispensation may be preferred, the new dispensation is not strong. In  fact,
there is nobody who wants the new dispensation to stay as  it  is,  just  as
much as there are people who want  aspects  of  the  new  dispensation.  Not
everybody feels that they got everything that they wanted. But that  is  the
nature of politics. We again submit that what  we  have  here  is  something
that everybody can live and work with.

All those issues that were generally identified as issues  of  consent,  and
which concerned most of the stakeholders, have been addressed in  the  Bill,
to the letter, for example the issue of security of tenure and the issue  of
discretion, which in the end  boils  down  to  us  having  to  define  black
economic empowerment and the social and labour plan. That is  in  the  Bill,
but in addition we are bringing a  charter  which  we  will  be  working  on
together with the industry, so that when we table it, it will  be  a  launch
not by Government alone,  but  something  that  we  will  be  launching  and
bringing to the public together.

The debates have been shifting as  we  went  along.  As  I  just  indicated,
initially what was thought to be a problem regarding security of tenure  was
the number of years for which people would be able to have a valid  licence.
We were able to address that.  In  fact,  we  are  now  in  an  even  better
position than other countries that we compete with. Even  what  we  proposed
initially was quite competitive. So, the issue of the number  of  years  for
which people will hold a licence for prospecting and mining ceased to be  an
issue. Over  the  past  few  days  the  issue  has  simply  been  about  the
definitions. As I have said, we have included those definitions in the  main
body of the Bill, but in addition to that we also have the charter.

The other issue that came up during the hearings in relation  to  these  two
issues that I have referred to was quantification. Again, in the charter  we
are going  to  quantify  what  quantum  of  empowerment  will  be  expected,
because, as hon members can imagine, we want meaningful empowerment.

I would just like to  make  reference  to  some  of  the  critical  and  key
contents of  the  Bill.  These  include  the  principles  that  the  mineral
resources are part of the national patrimony which have to be developed  for
the  benefit  of  all  South  Africans;  that  the  state,   as   the   sole
representative of all the people of this country, is the  custodian  of  the
nation's mineral resources; and that it is a  universally  recognised  right
of any state to exercise fundamental  and  permanent  sovereignty  over  its
natural resources, including mineral resources.

We have the ``use it or lose it''  principle,  which  is  another  mechanism
that guarantees security of tenure, because as long as one ``uses  it''  one
will never ``lose it''. In fact, it is a ``use it and keep it'' principle.

The Bill includes redress as a result  of  past  discrimination.  This  also
takes our constitutional responsibility further. The  Bill  will  contribute
to socioeconomic development and social upliftment by mining companies,  who
will be working together with the state in undertaking this  task,  so  that
we will never again have a situation in our country where there is  enormous
wealth that God has given to all of us on the one hand, but just behind  the
mine there is extreme poverty. This is the reality that we have  today,  and
this Bill will work towards bringing that to an end.

This Bill also enhances respect for and the protection of  the  environment,
not just the natural  environment,  ensuring  that  mining  has  no  adverse
effects on the community and employees. I do not have to remind hon  members
about the asbestos cases. We do not want that to happen in our country  ever
again.

The Bill provides for compensation in cases  where  there  is  any  form  of
expropriation during or after transition. In fact, today,  to  tighten  that
up, members from the ANC will effect an amendment  in  order  to  make  sure
that that compensation is even tighter after transition. I can  tell  people
who have argued about the constitutionality of the Bill  that  primarily  it
has been  about  what  this  Bill  means  for  compensation.  We  have  done
everything we could to ensure that that is addressed. But there  is  already
a judgment on this issue, State vs LMT, where the judge ruled  that  mineral
rights were not propriety rights. Notwithstanding that, we  are  willing  to
pay compensation and we want to assure those colleagues, in the New  NP  and
the IFP, who were worried about that, that we  are  just  as  committed  and
concerned as they are regarding this issue.

Maqabane, siwulungele  lo  msebenzi.  Zonke  izinto  neenkqubo  ezifunekayo,
ukuze lo Mthetho uYilwayo ukwazi ukuqhubela phambili,  sesizenzile.  Iimbiza
sizihlambile,  abantu  sibalungisile  namaphepha,   siwaqoqoshile   kwisebe.
Bayadlalisa  abantu  abathi  senze  umthetho  esingasayi  kukwazi  ukuwumela
ngesiphekepheke. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Comrades, we are ready for this work.  Everything  and  all  the  necessary
programmes, that  should  enable  this  Bill  to  move  forward,  have  been
finalised. We have washed the pots, and the department has  prepared  people
and the relevant documentation. People who  say  that  we  rushed  the  Bill
through are just playing.]

We are ready to implement this Bill.  We  will  be  launching  our  cadastre
system, which will show that we have put in place  the  systems,  technology
and administrative backup that will make sure that we can administer in  the
new way. We have a new organogram in the department, which  is  adding  some
of the posts which will make sure that the new  responsibilities  that  this
Bill assigns to us will be carried by people who exist on  our  payroll.  It
will not be done outside the department.

We are strengthening our regional offices. When members are  at  home,  they
can visit some of  our  regional  offices.  They  will  find  that  we  have
actually  made  provision  in  order  to  make  sure  that  there  will   be
assistance, in particular because there will be  many  SMMEs  that  will  be
coming into the fold. Those SMMEs will go to  our  offices  and  find  staff
members who are ready to deal with, assist and guide them.

We have also included beneficiation in this Bill, because, as  many  members
will know, in almost all African mining economies we stop  at  mining,  with
very little effort to add value to our mineral resources, and  therefore  we
simply export jobs. Many  hon  members  have  spoken  to  me,  publicly  and
privately, about the need for us to do something about that. I am sure  that
this is something that all of us in this House,  no  matter  what  party  we
come from, would like to see succeeding. So, empowerment  will  also  ensure
that we stimulate beneficiation.

When  people  come  and  apply  for  licences  and   there   are   competing
applications, the Bill provides for the Minister to give priority  to  those
companies that  have  a  plan  for  adding  value.  This  will  ensure  that
companies do take this seriously.

The Bill also takes on a number of social issues, such as  the  ghost  towns
in areas where there is no longer mining. In those areas, we  will  be  able
to use our royalties to go back and address the poverty and economic  crisis
that continue to exist there. The Bill also  provides  for  areas  that  are
host communities where mining is currently taking place, but where there  is
no plan to see to it that when mining is no longer taking place the  economy
will diversify so  that  people  are  not  left  high  and  dry.  This  Bill
addresses this issue,  by  directing  royalties  to  address  that,  and  by
working together with the mining industry to address the potential  negative
social impact of mining in those communities.

The  Bill  also  accommodates  what  we  call  dense  labour-sending  areas,
because, with regard to migrant labour,  a  lot  of  our  miners  come  from
places far away from the mines and, usually, and as  we  know  historically,
those areas have been left in poverty and underdevelopment. This  Bill  will
go back to the dense labour-sending areas, which are communities which  Teba
once ravaged, and develop them. Now we are glad that Teba  has  also  turned
itself into a rural development agency, and we will be working with them  to
restore life and dignity to those communities.

As I have said, we are ready to do business. We are  very  much  focused  on
the future. We are looking at how  we  will  make  sure  that  we  take  new
entrants into the future dispensation. Local or international players -  big
or small - will all now only need to go to the department in order  to  make
applications, instead of having  to  look  for  mineral  rights  from  their
competitors, as was the case in the past. They will be able to  access  much
more easily the deposits that they could not use even though those  who  had
those deposits in their possession did not intend using them. The  ``use  it
or lose it'' principle will make that possible.

People who were historically disadvantaged will  be  able  to  come  to  our
institutions to seek assistance, especially when  it  comes  to  technology.
The advice that we are talking about includes even the  actual  construction
of mines, and Minister Ngubane has assured me that  Mintek  is  one  of  the
institutions that will be brought to the party in order  to  help.  I  thank
the Minister for his kindness. [Laughter.]

Regarding small prospectors, hon members know that this is  where  the  risk
is much higher and that banks do not treat people who are  prospectors  very
well. Our Council for Geoscience will hand-hold some of our  small  and  new
prospectors in order to assist them to reduce the risk.  The  Bill  provides
access to data that the companies are no longer  using  to  be  made  public
within a stipulated period so that other people who  need  that  information
can use it.

For established companies and bigger players, the security of tenure  of  30
years is more than competitive. It is better that in  Canada,  Botswana  and
Australia. We are going to be doing good business here.

For big business there is also going to be a possibility for  the  retention
of a licence if the need arises, as could be the case if  market  conditions
are not favourable. The Bill allows the Minister to have that  discretion  -
something people did not want - which they will need desperately  if  market
conditions turn against them. The Minister will be able  to  be  considerate
and allow them to retain their licences even though they are unable  to  use
them optimally at that particular point.

The paying of royalties to the state is definitely going to be a  much  more
pleasant thing  to  do,  because  royalties  will  not  be  as  high  or  as
exorbitant as royalties paid to private owners, as  has  been  the  case  in
some instances. Of course, we are going  to  quantify  the  charter.  People
have been throwing around a figure of 25% empowerment that is  going  to  be
in  the  charter.  What  we  can  say  as  a  department  is  that  we  want
historically disadvantaged people to be  minority  owners  in  the  existing
mines. However, we want to see meaningful minorities in accordance with  the
Companies Act, which is 26%-plus.

We also want HDP's to be significant players in general. Therefore  when  we
issue licences for the new mines we expect them to  position  themselves  as
significant and majority players. They should  be  able  to  go  around  and
identify international and local partners who will bring them the  expertise
and resources that they  will  need  in  order  to  utilise  their  licences
effectively.

These licences are also going to be the  one  shield  that  small  companies
will have when they go to the banks to raise money. They  will  be  able  to
indicate that they have these rights and the ore body and as a  result  they
will be treated by the banks in a much better way  than  if  they  had  gone
without anything which can be regarded as collateral.

There are benefits for workers as well in this Bill. We  have  progressively
redefined the employee in line with mine health  and  safety,  in  order  to
make sure that contractors do not  abuse  workers  and  that  there  are  no
workers who fall between the cracks in terms of the law. Of course,  we  are
including a social plan which  will  ensure  that  the  provision  made  for
retrenchment is made right at the beginning of  the  work,  and  that  there
will be multiskilling so that no worker would  stay  for  20  years  in  the
mines as a so-called unskilled worker.

A mining company which does not do all these things will simply  not  get  a
licence. If they do not train, multiskill and provide a  social  plan,  then
they simply do not deserve to be in this industry. It is  very  much  labour
intensive, therefore one cannot focus only on rands and cents, but  also  on
people. We know the effects of not focusing on people.

In any case, we have  the  skills  Act  which  has  already  been  financed.
Therefore companies do not need to look for new money; they simply must  use
the money in the kitty which they have not been using. We already  have  the
Employment Equity Act, therefore as far as representivity  in  companies  in
concerned, we are not asking them to  do  something  they  are  not  already
familiar with. This has already been provided for in the  Employment  Equity
Act, they must simply put it into practice.

As  far  as  communities  are  concerned,  we  hope  that  our   traditional
communities  which  are  blessed  with   minerals   are   also   positioning
themselves, because they will be able to receive royalties  continuously  as
long as they have a development plan which shows that  they  will  be  using
the royalties for the development of the  community.  Therefore  the  chiefs
will be able to continue looking after their  people,  and  they  will  have
something to show for it. I address these remarks to Kgosi over there.

When it comes to holding licences, they will also  be  encouraged  to  apply
for licences in their own right. But, obviously, they will have to meet  the
criteria. For now, many of the traditional communities are satisfied  simply
to receive royalties. We are saying that in the new dispensation we want  to
assist them to organise themselves  into  proper  companies,  and  to  train
people and invest in scholarships, which we will provide  through  the  MQA,
so that in those traditional communities one has a  geologist  yakwaMaretane
nonjiniyela baBafokeng [from Maretane and Bafokeng engineers].

There is no reason why the Bafokeng do not have leading mining engineers  in
the country. They should know that if they had engineers they would be  able
to use them. For us that is the best prize that this Bill  can  bring  about
in this country and in this nation.

Laphaya emalahleni KwaZulu-Natal - uma esekhona - sifuna ukubona  onjiniyela
basemalahleni abangoDlamini noMaMkhize. [There in the coal mines in KwaZulu-
Natal - if there are still any - we want to see  mining  engineers  who  are
from the Dlamini and Ngcobo clans.]

We in the department will give extra attention to making sure that we  bring
about these benefits. Therefore empowerment in the case of this Bill is  not
referred to as BEE. We refer to it as broad-based socioeconomic  empowerment
-  BBSEE  -  because  it  covers  ownership,  affirmative  procurement   and
compulsory operational involvement of black people.

Therefore to be a bona fide BEE company now you will have to come  and  say:
Nampa abantu  bami  engizobathuthukisa:  nguDlamini,  nguNgcobo,  nguNaidoo,
nguKoekemoer, nguMkhize noGqumshe, futhi bese uthi:  [Here  are  my  people,
whom I am going to develop: Dlamini, Ngcobo, Naidoo, Koekemoer,  Mkhize  and
Gqumshe, and he must say:] These are the people that will be  empowered  and
trained, and this is how they are going to be involved.

Uma umuntu  eza  yedwa  ephethe  incwadi  yakhe  yamasheke  ehamba  nge-4x4,

book and one drives a 4x4, one can forget about it.] [Interjections.] We  do
not regard that person as a bona fide empowerment company, because  we  want
to see the people that are going to be empowered  as  a  result  of  such  a
venture. There must be a programme between that person and  the  company  he
or she will be working with which shows  that  such  a  person  is  actually
going to be doing business with that company.

The economic and social security of the country is the biggest  concern  for
all  of  us.  Therefore  we  would  like  to  urge  members  of  Parliament,
especially members of the opposition, to exercise restraint when they  shoot
down this Bill, because that would portray the country  in  an  unfavourable
light for a problem that does not exist.

This Bill has addressed all the issues that have been raised and  issues  of
genuine concern. We regard the Chamber of Mines as  an  important  employer,
and therefore we would  like  to  see  it  continue  to  play  the  role  of
organising employers in this industry and to continue to  work  towards  the
transformation of this  industry  through  them.  They  have  been  able  to
demonstrate that they can do that, judging, for instance, by the  role  they
played during the mining summit.

Therefore there is nothing to fear from this Bill. It is an inclusive  Bill,
it is the Bill of the future, it is a modernising Bill, and  it  is  a  Bill
which all of us should be able to be proud of, because it has something  for
everybody. That is a result of the big balancing act which the ANC is  known
for in this economy. We tried to think about everybody.

I would like to thank my staff and drafters who have done a  remarkable  and
amazing job in  achieving  this  balancing  act.  Kha  nisukumeni  kwakhona.
[Uwele-wele.]  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  [Please  stand  up  again.   [Interjections.]
[Applause.]]

These are my young drafters who are determined to make  the  future  a  good
one. They have a stake in this because they are going to  be  around  for  a
long time. I would like to say that hon  members  know  our  department  and
that we have been around, and we have never done anything foolish.  We  have
been very fair, we treat companies fairly, we give service to  the  best  of
our ability and we are the champions of this industry, whether  the  players
are big or small, foreign or local. Our  bona  fides  speak  for  themselves
when it comes to that, and there is no way we will throw away  all  we  have
built through this Bill, because if we do that, we will also  be  out  of  a
job.

Therefore this is a shared concern, and this  is  a  shared  future  we  are
bringing here. Of course, I would like to thank the members  of  Parliament,
the ANC study group, the two chairpersons who have also  worked  in  leading
members, and those representatives of the opposition, such as the  UDM,  who
were very supportive  in  the  National  Assembly  yesterday  and  who  made
brilliant points about the future that this Bill presents.

I would like to thank civil  society,  the  churches,  traditional  leaders,
academics, banks, the small and junior miners,  all  of  whom  have  rallied
behind us in order for us to go forward. Opportunities  will  be  opened.  I
would like hon members to go back to their communities and alert  them  that
the future in the mining industry is about to begin, and tell them  that  if
they snooze, they lose. Uma  belala,  bayasala.  [Ubuwele-wele.]  [Ihlombe.]
[If they sleep, they will be left behind. [Interjections.] [Applause.]]

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, this morning some very arrogant party  boss  must
have told our Adv Lever that he had better find a way  to  stop  this  Bill.
Therefore as he fell out of bed he thought of the first rule that came  into
his mind, and that was Rule 111 of the Joint Rules. It is a good one, but  I
have said many times that Adv  Lever's  legal  opinions  are  a  little  bit
suspect, and I am going to explain why I say so.
Firstly, a Joint Rule was not used in order to  have  these  processes  take
place jointly. If a Joint Rule is used, the House  has  passed  resolutions.
But for the past eight years we have had public hearings with  the  National
Assembly committees, and never have we done it under Joint  Rule  111.  That
rule creates a special committee which takes care of  the  DME  Bill.  There
was no such committee  in  this  process.  Instead,  there  was  the  Select
Committee on Economic Affairs and the Portfolio Committee  on  Minerals  and
Energy.

And just to underscore this, and just so Mr Lever  does  not  think  we  are
fools, a letter went out to the Chief Whip a long time ago - early in May  -
and that letter said:


  Approval is hereby sought by the Select Committee on Economic Affairs  to
  participate in hearings to be conducted by  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
  Minerals and Energy.

That letter is on record, if Mr Lever needs it.

There is another letter which was sent to Ms Ntlabati, the Chair of  Chairs,
which said:


  Approval is hereby sought by  the  select  committee  to  participate  in
  hearings to be conducted by  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Minerals  and
  Energy.

There is another letter which went out with regard  to  public  hearings  in
the provinces, and that one said:


  Approval is hereby sought by  the  select  committee  to  conduct  public
  hearings during the period 5 to 12 June.

There are numerous others. Mr Lever  must  not  take  chances.  When  he  is
clutching at straws, he must admit that he is clutching at straws,  and  let
the matter rest. He has lost this battle. This battle has been won  for  the
people of the country.

On that note, I want to say that today is a very auspicious  day.  Today  is
26 June, the day on which in 1955 the people of our  country  -  delegations
from all over the country - came in buses,  trains  and  taxis  to  meet  in
Kliptown to draft a freedom charter. One of the  things  they  did  in  that
Freedom Charter was to say that the people must share in the wealth  of  the
country.

And it is appropriate, whether by chance or not, that today is the day  that
the economy of this country is to change forever. Within the  next  five  to
ten years we will see one of the most widely and closely  held  bastions  of
the apartheid economy slowly turn around and change, so that we may  have  a
true transformation of the economy of this country.

I want to say that there is a  person  who  has  a  birthday  on  this  very
auspicious day; it is the birthday of our very hon Director-General  of  the
Department of Minerals and  Energy.  [Applause.]  We  want  to  say  to  the
Director-General that this is a gift to him, his department and  the  people
that he represents as Parliament finishes this work today, and we also  want
to say to him, ``Take this flame and carry it forward for the people of  our
country''.

When this Bill was tabled in Parliament early in May for  consideration,  we
knew that there were basically three  or  four  big  stakeholders  that  had
difficulties with it. We knew that industry had difficulties. We  knew  that
Cosatu had difficulties. We  knew  that  communities  -  the  Bafokeng,  the
Barolong, the Bakgatla baMakgopa and a number of  other  communities  -  had
problems with the royalty issues around this Bill. When we  took  this  Bill
on some of us took the approach that we would like to be balanced and  fair;
that we would like to give all sides the opportunity to present their  case;
that we would interrogate and unpack every concern that was raised  and  try
and deal with it in an even-handed manner.

We were aware that the Bill and its contents  had  been  a  discussion  that
started as long ago as 1994. Two years ago a Bill was tabled  in  Parliament
which was so controversial that it was eventually withdrawn. We  were  aware
of the intense discussions, the intense lobbying,  the  high-level  meetings
and the lekgotlas that were taking  place  with  regard  to  this  Bill.  We
thought  we  understood  all  these  issues.  Then  came  the  parliamentary
process.

Over 88 written submissions were made. Over 50 oral submissions were  taken,
and hundreds of oral submissions were taken when we  went  to  the  remotest
parts of the country - to our provinces. We went  to  a  number  of  places,
including Springbok in the Northern  Cape.  We  went  to  Mangkweng  in  the
Limpompo province. We went to Welkom in the Free State and Wolmaransstad  in
the North West province. What we learnt is that we did  not  understand  the
issues until we had spoken to everybody.

What we  learnt  was  that  the  conflict  and  controversy  was  not  about
constitutionality  and  property  rights,  nor  was   the   conflict   about
ministerial discretion. The conflict  was  not  about  uncertainty  in  this
Bill. The controversy was not about security of  tenure,  and  it  certainly
was not about judicial appeal. What we learnt, with dismay, in every  single
discussion we had, was that the controversy was  about  transformation.  The
more we discussed and debated with stakeholders, the  more  we  learnt  that
although much had changed since 1994, in fact, nothing had changed at all.

I must say that  after  so  many  had  given  their  lives,  after  so  much
bloodshed, after so much poverty, after so much hard work that we  ourselves
and many others had done to turn our destiny around since  1994,  and  after
the compassion and the patience of our people and especially  after  Madiba,
it was disconcerting that our largest companies that  control  over  40%  of
our economy and close  to  R1  trillion  in  total  had  no  vision  and  no
commitment to transformation. Over and over  again  they  missed  the  whole
point of the exercise. They continued to demand,  like  spoilt  brats,  that
they be allowed to have  their  cake  and  eat  it  alone  in  their  little
corners.

They used almost every senior and experienced legal mind in the  country  to
block this Bill. They threatened us. They falsely claimed  that  there  were
flaws in the Bill that did not exist. They misled  us  about  little  things
and big things. Let me give the House just  one  example  of  this.  On  the
first day of the public hearings the lawyers came to us and made a very  big
issue about a little matter - the definition of optimal  mining.  They  said
that this was completely unacceptable, that it was  uncertain,  that  nobody
understood this and so forth. One of them even went so far as  to  say  that
this was a constitutionality point because of certainty.

Two days later, when we asked the mine bosses and the  departments  if  they
understood what the words ``optimal mining''  meant,  they  said  of  course
they did. Their bosses, the bosses  who  employed  the  lawyers,  said  ``Of
course we understand what is meant by optimal mining! These words have  been
in the mining Act for decades and, in fact everybody in the  industry  knows
what  we  mean  when  we  say  `optimal  mining'.''  Yet,  these  were   the
presentations that were made before the committee.

Similarly, there were other misleading criticisms,  and  I  will  deal  with
some of them, such  as  the  constitutionality  issue  and  the  assault  on
property rights. I am  sure  my  friend  Mr  Lever  will  try  some  suspect
arguments again on this issue.

Clause 25 of our Constitution allows for the limitation of  property  rights
provided  that  it  is  in  the  public  interest,  it  is  reasonable   and
justifiable in an open and democratic society and it is  a  law  of  general
application. If property, in terms of our Constitution, is  expropriated  by
the state, compensation must be paid. But that the  Constitution  gives  the
right to the state to expropriate  is  not  in  question.  It  is  expressly
mentioned in the Constitution, and we may do so if, as I said, it is in  the
public interest, a law of general application and so forth.

This Bill has clear compensation  clauses.  It  goes  further  to  expressly
create a right of compensation.  This  morning  the  NCOP  effected  further
amendments to make this absolutely clear. I wish to state categorically  and
assure my hon colleagues that in no way and in no aspect  of  this  Bill  is
there a constitutionality problem as far as the legal  minds  that  we  have
spoken to are concerned.

The second problem was the complaint about uncertainty around what  economic
empowerment means. An amendment was effected to the Bill to make  absolutely
clear  what  broad-based  economic  empowerment  means  by   introducing   a
definition to this effect - the Minister mentioned it.  It  is  a  wonderful
definition, and I ask colleagues to take the time  to  find  this  Bill  and
read that definition, because that, in effect, is where we  are  going  when
we talk about transformation.

We also asked the Minister to introduce a charter in terms of clause 100  of
the Bill - to bring further clarity to the  issue  of  economic  empowerment
and actually to indicate exactly what the industry is  expected  to  do.  So
there was no uncertainty issue in the first place, but if there  was  it  is
even clearer now. There is a definition and there is a charter.

On the question of security of  tenure,  the  transitional  arrangements  in
this Bill have clear, definable criteria in terms of which old-order  mining
rights, that is existing mining rights, can be  converted  into  new  mining
rights. It says simply this: ``You may continue to engage in mining  if  you
play by the new rules, because the times  they  are  a-changin'".  Once  you
understand and play by the new rules, you are as secure as you can  wish  to
be. The Minister must give you your right  to  mine  and  must  renew  those
rights.''

Let me demonstrate how unfair the criticism has been  against  the  Minister
and against the department. Namibia, Canada, Australia,  Tanzania  and  many
other countries have periods of between 21 and 25 years for  mining  rights.
In this Bill, the department introduced a period of  30  years,  nine  years
more than that of most other countries. I will be  70  years  old  when  the
first mining rights expire, and many of the members in this  House  will  be
well over 100. Bless them if they live to that age. [Laughter.]

In many other countries the renewal periods with  regard  to  mining  rights
are up to 15 years, some of them are  10  years,  they  are  renewable  only
once, and so forth. In this country  we  have  allowed  them  a  further  30
years' renewal period. In other words, if somebody has a mining  right  now,
they can continue mining for 60 years. And if there are  still  reserves  in
the ground, they can continue to mine after  that,  and  yet  they  had  the
audacity to attack this department for being unfair and for attacking  their
security of tenure. This is what we learnt in the  public  hearings  process
and that is what I am saying - the issue was not about anything else  except
transformation.

Let  the  detractors  make  us  believe  that   they   really   believe   in
transformation. Yesterday, in the  National  Assembly  member  Ian  Davidson
said, ``We really believe in transformation. We really want  black  economic
empowerment'', but on every issue around transformation he stood in our  way
in the committee. On every  issue  they  blocked  transformation.  On  every
issue they tried to represent only the interests of the minority - the  rich
and the wealthy - and let the country take note of this. Let  this  go  down
in the annals of history that there were certain individuals who refused  to
strike off those shackles of apartheid and who wanted  to  keep  our  people
subjugated and poor, but after this day that era is over. [Interjections.]

In the end, we believe, and we sleep well,  knowing  that  all  stakeholders
were heard and, to the extent that their concerns were legitimate,  we  took
them on board and we addressed them. Cosatu's concerns regarding the way  in
which mining houses have been treating mine  workers  have  been  addressed.
The way in which they tried to get in  through  the  back  door  around  the
Labour  Relations  Act,  by  employing  independent  contractors  to   bring
labourers, has been addressed. We have also  allowed  Cosatu  to  adopt  the
position that labour plans for  skills  development  and  other  issues  are
required in terms of this Bill.

We have reintroduced royalties to the communities, because  the  last  thing
that this Bill wanted to do was to deprive those who  have  been  benefiting
even  in  a  meagre  way  from  this  mining  industry.  We  say  to   those
communities, ``Beware and be alert.  We  are  not  going  to  allow  you  to
continue receiving royalties and sit back and relax. You, the Bafokeng,  the
Barolong, the Makgopa are expected  to  become  the  mining  houses  of  the
future. If you do not, you are probably  going  to  be  attacked  from  this
Parliament.'' [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chairperson, hon Minister, colleagues and guests,  it  is  a
great pleasure for me to speak today on this Bill, because in the future  we
will refer to the importance of this day, especially those of  us  who  come
from the liberation struggle. We also know that on this particular day,  the
people of this country made a declaration and in that declaration they  also
gave us a guiding light, which is led by  the  ANC  today,  of  the  Freedom
Charter.

We understand that this Bill is  an  answer  to  the  clarion  call  of  our
fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters who laid down  their  lives  for  the
liberation of this country. It is important at this juncture to refresh  our
memories with a lesson in history. It is  a  little  known  fact  that  many
indigenous South Africans actually owned and worked diamond claims,  firstly
on the Vaal River diggings and then in the four  diamond  mines  operational
in Kimberley prior to July 1872. In fact, available evidence shows  that  in
mid-1872 at least 80% of all diamond claims at  that  time  were  owned  and
worked by indigenous people for their own account.

These exclude the minerals exploited before the arrival of Jan  van  Riebeck
in  1652,  on  this  very  shore  where  Cape  Town  is  located  today.  No
compensation was paid to those blacks and coloured persons whose wealth  and
claims were seized.

In July 1872, the introduction of certain pass and other  laws  removed  all
mineral right ownership from the  indigenous  people  and  restricted  their
movement, thus  curtailing  their  economic  effectiveness.  Cecil  Rhodes's
laws, passed around 1887, it will be  remembered,  effectively  reduced  all
black people to a life as a source of cheap labour,  imprisoned  by  poverty
and excluded from any resource ownership. Had all  this  never  happened,  I
have no doubt in my mind, blacks too  would  have  formed  their  own  giant
mining houses.

History has taught us that black people  were  great  miners  in  the  past.
However, it is important for those  who  have  very  short  memories  to  be
reminded of the fact that it was the colonial  and  apartheid  policies  and
practices that ensured that blacks today do not command the heights  of  our
own economy. This is not a reflection of  our  innate  ability  to  run  and
manage mines. This state of affairs  and  misconception  definitely  has  to
change.

We cannot continue to be mere labourers in the country  of  our  birth.  Our
forefathers and foremothers fought for our complete and  total  freedom.  We
dare not fail them. Those who think that we cannot mine are  in  for  a  big
surprise. Given an opportunity, and this Bill does do that, we will one  day
command the heights of our economy. A very good example  of  black  people's
ability to manage and run their own mines is to be  found  in  Ghana,  where
they have a company called Ashanti. If one visits their mines in  Ghana  one
will see Africans at work in their own mines.  Therefore,  those  who  think
that mining is beyond the reach of black people are wrong.

Although the creation of a  world-class  mining  industry  in  this  country
resulted in the oppression of our people, there are certain aspects of  that
oppression and suffering which  led  to  the  liberation  struggle  for  the
economic  and  social  emancipation  of  the  masses  of  our  people.   The
liberation struggle waged by the oppressed masses of  our  country,  led  by
the ANC and its allies, was informed by the need  to  correct  these  social
and economic injustices.

The rise of the trade union movement in the mining industry was  a  response
by the mineworkers to the effective  marginalisation  of  black  workers  as
mere purveyors of cheap labour. The early  struggles  of  black  mineworkers
were throttled by the apartheid regime. The mining sector,  of  course,  sat
at the heart of the  apartheid  state  which  denied  black  South  Africans
economic and political power in their own country.

This spirit which inspired early mining unions is captured  in  the  Freedom
Charter, drafted almost 47 years  ago,  by  hundreds  of  ordinary  workers,
businesspersons, intellectuals, professionals, the youth and  women  of  all
national groups. The Freedom Charter declares that South Africa  belongs  to
all who live in it. The same spirit found expression in the  mass  struggles
of the 1970s and 1980s in the rise  of  the  biggest  mining  union  in  the
world, the National Union of Mineworkers.

We are excited as the ANC, because today everybody is going to see  the  new
South Africa that is going to come. With those few words, the  ANC  supports
this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, today we are perhaps debating one  of  the  most
important  pieces  of  legislation  that  has  ever  been  debated  in  this
Parliament, or passed in this Parliament. As a result,  the  Bill  has  been
dubbed controversial in certain quarters.

The mining industry in this country actually  formed  the  backbone  of  the
South African economy, which created  hundreds  of  thousands  of  jobs  and
provided the foundation for a  modern,  vibrant  economy.  However,  it  was
unfortunate that the majority of South Africans were actually excluded.

Mineral rights are owned by private persons and the  state.  It  is  also  a
fact that private ownership of these rights is  limiting  opportunities  for
new entrants and new investors to gain meaningful access  to  the  industry.
The Bill before us today seeks to transform the mining industry  in  such  a
manner that it is brought into line with the  realities  of  the  new  South
Africa, particularly in respect of broadening  the  ownership  base  thereby
empowering the historically disadvantaged.

Black economic empowerment is obviously vital to the  long-term  success  of
the economy and, indeed, to  our  democracy.  But  empowerment  should  mean
meaningful participation for historically disadvantaged  persons  and,  very
importantly, for communities, in the  ownership  and  management  of  mining
ventures that will benefit all concerned. The  Bill  does  actually  address
this to a very great extent.

The question of royalties currently  received  by  communities  from  mining
operations is a very sensitive one. The state should ensure  that  royalties
are actually ploughed  back  into  the  communities  from  which  they  were
derived. The current recipients of royalties will continue to  receive  them
for a period of at least five years,  if  certain  criteria  are  met.  This
amendment is very welcome.

The  Bill  provides,  amongst  other  things,  for   the   creation   of   a
socioeconomic  empowerment  charter  that  will  establish  the   framework,
targets and timetable for the entry of  historically  disadvantaged  persons
into the mining industry. Again, as the Minister has clearly explained,  the
question of constitutionality is actually being addressed  and  has  been  a
concern to quite a number of us, particularly the IFP. Therefore, we say  to
the IFP, regarding the fundamental  philosophy  and  the  principle  of  the
Bill, that we fully support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the hon Moosa  has  addressed  procedural  issues
and I would like to answer him.  Firstly,  joint  public  hearings  are  one
thing, but discussion and debate on the Bill  jointly  with  the  respective
committees are another matter.
Secondly, notice of joint meetings was not published in  the  Announcements,
Tablings and Committee Reports, the ATCs. The unreliable post in  the  Marks
Building means that we tend to rely  on  the  ATCs.  Other  members  of  the
committee stated in my presence that they also did not  receive  notice,  or
received short notice, of these meetings.  [Interjections.]  On  the  day  I
received timeous notice, that is Monday this week, there  was,  besides  the
co-chair and myself, just one other member of the NCOP committee present  at
the time - the hon member from my province, I might add.

We should jealously guard our separate identity as a  House  of  Parliament.
We have an  obligation  as  a  House  of  review  to  reach  an  independent
conclusion on a section 75 piece of legislation. Our  processes  should  not
simply mirror the debates in the NA portfolio committee. There is  a  danger
of this happening if we simply sit  with  the  National  Assembly  portfolio
committee. If we allow this to happen, we simply become a rubber  stamp  and
abrogate our responsibility to independently review section 75  legislation.
[Interjections.]

In regard to the Bill currently before this House, the main objection of  my
party is that it does not take into account the capital cost  of  developing
a mine, and does not sufficiently safeguard the security of tenure  in  that
respect. It is primarily for that reason that the DP will vote against  this
Bill.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, may I say that  my  party  is  not  against  the
objects of this Bill, but we are uneasy about how these are to be  achieved.
My party believes in private  property  rights,  small  government  and  the
minimum of ministerial discretion. I would like to say to the Minister  that
we do need to be careful.

May I say that I respect the way the  hon  the  Minister  has  handled  this
matter and the sensitivity she has displayed. It is right that  she  should,
because we are dealing here with an industry  which  is  one  of  the  great
success stories of the world, a Rolls-Royce industry and the  pride  of  the
world. We should be doing everything to help them, and do nothing to  hinder
them or to create uncertainties or doubts where they do not exist.

Therefore, I am very glad that this Minister is going to  take  this  matter
before promulgation for a constitutional test, because if the  Minister  has
doubts, what doubts can the industry not have? Let  me  also  say,  and  the
Minister would know, that if one starts a gold mine it takes R8  billion  of
investment before one sees an ounce of gold, and one does not know what  the
prices are going to be. The timeframes and the capital investment are  huge,
and the risks as one spins them out  into  the  distance  become  so  great.
Therefore, we should do nothing to disturb that situation.

The hon member Moosa  mentioned  here  Tanzania  and  Namibia.  I  have  had
experience of mining in Tanzania. I can tell the House that they give one  a
20-year tax holiday to open a  mine  there.  Their  mining  industry  is  in
absolute chaos. Namibia has hardly got a mining industry. So  to  use  those
examples is not very good.

We are one of the great ...

An HON MEMBER: There is Australia.

Mr K D S DURR: Well, Australia is a  different  kettle  of  fish.  It  is  a
different kettle of fish, because there are other incentives that they  have
which Mr Moosa did not mention. [Interjections.]

Let me tell  the  House  that  we  mine  at  depths  and  in  fractions  ...
[Interjections.] If one had to start our mining industry  today,  one  would
not start it. That is the reality. We mine at depths and in fractions  which
nobody in the world would even dream about. As a matter of  fact,  we  would
not dream about it if we had to start today. Nobody would build those  mines
if they had to start today.

We have an underground electrified system  under  Johannesburg  which  makes
the London Underground look like a pony. It is one of the great  wonders  of
the world. I do not know if hon members realise that. But we would never  do
it today. If we had to start today,  we  would  never  develop  it.  If  one
started trying to do that today, one could not do it.

We have an impetus and a momentum which has come to us  from  the  past.  We
have to maintain that momentum into the future. Once we lose that  momentum,
we will never put that humpty dumpty together again.

Hon members should look at the Zambian industry. I am not  saying  that  the
Minister is pretending to  do  what  the  Zambians  did,  but  the  Zambians
nationalised their industry in 1974. They paid Anglo American  $74  million,
which they took and used to start Minorco. Today Minorco  is  the  pride  of
South America, the pride of Australia, the pride  of  Europe,  but  Zambia's
mining industry is on its back and they cannot even give  their  mines  back
to Anglo American. So we have to be very careful, but we  will  support  the
Bill. [Applause.]

Ms M  P  THEMBA:  Chairperson,  bengicabanga  kutsi  lilunga  lelihlon  Durr

hon member Durr was as Christian-like as the name of his party. But,  it  is
clear that it is just a name, his deeds do not correspond with  his  party's
name.]

Those who succeed in life are those who dare to dream and have  the  ability
to translate those dreams into tangible outcomes. It is always the  path  to
the realisation of one's dreams that has steep inclines and is fraught  with
difficulties, and that normally tends to discourage one  from  reaching  for
one's dream. Those who ignore the pain and soldier  on,  run  the  race  and
reach for their dreams.

Today I am very proud to stand before the  House  to  turn  into  reality  a
dream of those men and women who, on this day in 1955, gathered in  Kliptown
to adopt the Freedom Charter. The Freedom Charter embodies  the  dreams  and
aspirations of the people of this country. By the way, I want  to  wish  the
director-general a happy birthday.

These aspirations are informed both by our history and the  vision  for  our
future. It is this history that inspired and informed the conduct  and  form
of the liberation struggle, led by the ANC  and  its  people.  Some  of  our
comrades laid down their lives in order  to  translate  the  dreams  of  the
Congress of the People into reality.

Our revolutionary ancestors must be smiling down on us, as it is a  symbolic
coincidence that this Bill, which translates  their  Kliptown  dream's  into
reality, is passed on the same day that those dreams were expressed  by  the
Congress of the People.

I shall now proceed to paint in broad strokes the history that informed  the
dreams that inspired those men and women who adopted the Freedom Charter  as
the lodestar that would guide generations to come. The  mineral  discoveries
in South Africa had a  major  impact  on  the  South  African  socioeconomic
sphere. In particular, the current developments that affect  poverty,  which
characterises our rural areas, are to a large  extent  the  consequences  of
the so-called mineral revolution.

Labour was required on the mines on a  massive  scale,  and  could  only  be
provided by Africans. However, Africans could not be  dislodged  from  their
farms except by forceful means. Conquest, land dispossession,  taxation  and
pass laws were therefore imposed  to  force  black  men  off  the  land  and
channel them into the labour market, especially to meet  the  needs  of  the
mines.

The integration of Africans into the emerging urban areas  could  have  been
the logical result of this development,  but  short-term  recurrent  migrant
labourers suited the mine owners  and  the  government  of  the  day,  which
sought to entrench  the  system.  The  closed  compounds  pioneered  on  the
diamond fields as a means of labour control  were  replicated  at  the  gold
mines. The preservation of commercial areas from  which  migrants  could  be
drawn had the effect of lowering the wages, by denying  Africans  the  right
to be in urban areas and keeping their facilities and the  subsidised  plots
on which they depended in the reserves.

The socioeconomic problems currently besetting our rural areas are a  legacy
of our past, and particularly of the mining industry. Those members  of  the
opposition who object to this Bill addressing these problems, do so  because
privilege and wealth accumulated under apartheid insulated  them  from  this
reality. They have never experienced nor witnessed  the  hardship  that  the
temporary divorce that the migrant labour system imposed on the families  of
miners caused. They have not seen the abject poverty afflicting these  areas
as a result of land hunger.
It is for this reason that we take pride in the fact that this Bill has  the
objectives of promoting access to the nation's  mineral  resources  for  all
the  people  of  South  Africa;  expanding  opportunities  for  historically
disadvantaged persons to  enter  the  mining  industry;  promoting  economic
growth and development in the Republic; promoting employment  and  advancing
the social and economic welfare of all South  Africans;  and  ensuring  that
the holders of mining rights contribute to the socioeconomic development  of
the areas in which they are operating.

Our history has taught us that we cannot leave it to  the  mining  companies
to do this out of their goodwill. This Bill will therefore go a long way  in
addressing the legacy of the past. Women, including their own  white  women,
were not allowed to work underground  and  elsewhere  as  mineworkers.  They
were only allowed to be teamakers and were excluded from seeing  the  amount
of mineral wealth and achieving empowerment.

This Bill has enshrined the  inclusion  and  empowerment  of  women  in  the
mining industry. The department has realised  the  enthusiasm  of  women  to
participate in mining  ventures.  There  are  a  number  of  women  who  are
involved in artisanal mining. This Bill will facilitate  assistance,  be  it
financial  or  technical,  through  the  IDC,  the  DBSA,  the  Council  for
Geoscience and Mintech, in order to meet the needs of such women.

The social plan also focuses on the regeneration of  the  local  economy  in
respect of areas where mining is taking place. It is known that most  mining
activities take  place  in  rural  areas.  The  population  in  rural  areas
consists mainly of women and children. It is precisely these women who  will
benefit from the social plan initiatives.

Women have also been identified  as  capable  miners  within  junior  mining
companies. An example is Mrs Brigette Radebe. The Bill,  through  the  black
economic empowerment charter, will ensure  that  they  advance  into  large-
scale mining. Women are the country's pillar of strength  and  any  activity
that does not  includes  them,  including  mining  industry  activities,  is
unsustainable. If it does not work  for  a  woman,  it  does  not  work  for
anyone.

The Bill heralds the beginning of a process in terms of which  custody  over
our mineral and  petroleum  wealth  will  revert  to  public  ownership.  We
believe this Bill will open the door to a massive process of  transformation
in the mining sector, which will see historically disadvantaged  groups  and
individuals gaining access to the industry.

However, these things will not happen automatically. People need to be  made
aware of the potential benefits they can derive from this  new  legislation.
This  is  a  major  challenge,  particularly  in  our  rural  areas,   where
communication  infrastructure  has  not  yet   reached   all   our   people.
Information is empowerment. Rural communities need to  know  that  they  can
apply for mineral rights and can get financial assistance  to  start  small-
scale mining ventures. These  small-scale  mining  ventures  can  act  as  a
catalyst for employment and wealth creation, and can make rural  communities
self-reliant. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, hon Minister Mlambo-Ngcuka, and  colleagues,  it
is not often that a piece of legislation evokes so much emotion as  the  one
being debated today. The Select Committee on Economic and  Foreign  Affairs,
in joint sittings with the Portfolio Committee on Minerals and  Energy,  put
in long hours and literally burnt the midnight  oil,  so  to  speak,  in  an
effort to finalise this Bill which has been, and  still  is,  covered  in  a
cloud of controversy, as can be observed in the daily press.

The overall objective of the Bill is to foster the development of mining  in
South Africa in a  way  which  will  create  and  expand  opportunities  for
historically disadvantaged persons, but which will, at  the  same  time,  be
consistent with environmental responsibility.  The  Bill  provides  for  the
exploitation and development of minerals in a  full,  fair  and  transparent
manner, and supports the ``use it or lose  it''  principle  in  relation  to
large  nonmine-related  rights,   and   prioritises   environmental   issues
associated  with  mine  closures,  the  obligation  to  reclaim  land  where
possible  for  future  use,  and  ongoing   post-closure   development   and
empowerment of local communities.

The principal objective intended by the introduction  of  the  Bill  is  the
acknowledgement that South Africa's mineral and petroleum wealth belongs  to
the nation, that it is part of the national  patrimony  of  the  state,  and
that the state is the custodian  thereof  -  a  principle  which  is  almost
universally  recognised  and  applied  in  the  international   mining   and
petroleum industry.

The Bill provides  for  the  expansion  of  opportunities  for  historically
disadvantaged persons to enter and contribute  to  the  development  of  the
mineral industry, and to benefit  from  the  exploitation  of  the  nation's
mineral resources.  It  furthermore  provides  for  security  of  tenure  in
respect  of  prospecting  and  mining  operations,  and  the  promotion   of
employment and advancement of the social and economic welfare of  all  South
Africans. It is aimed at redress,  and  seeks  to  ensure  the  broader  and
meaningful economic participation of  our  previously  disadvantaged  fellow
South Africans, particularly in the mining sector, and it entails  ownership
and the reduction of income inequalities by enhancing participation  at  all
levels of the economy.

This Bill is a long-awaited revision of the mineral development  draft  Bill
released in December 2000.  That  Bill  generated  an  extensive  amount  of
commentary, and I quote  from  the  submission  of  one  of  the  commenting
parties:


  ... partly because South Africa is perceived to be creating a legislative
  template for other African states to follow and partly because  the  Bill
  departed radically from the familiar model of  tenured  and  transferable
  property rights.

Hoe lofwaardig die beginsel van hierdie wetsontwerp, waarmee die Nuwe NP  in
beginsel heelhartig saamstem, ookal is, is daar tog aspekte wat  bekommernis
wek. Die belangrikste hiervan is bekommernisse ten opsigte van besitreg,  en
die persepsie van moontlike onteienings wat bestaan,  asook  die  kommer  of
die voorskrifte, soos vervat in die wetsontwerp, aan die beginsels  van  die
Grondwet voldoen.

Dit is daarom verblydend  dat  die  Minister  na  gister  se  debat  in  die
Nasionale Vergadering, en na aanleiding van die voorstel  deur  my  Nuwe  NP
kollega Maans Nel,  onderneem  het  om  die  President  te  versoek  om  die
wetsontwerp voor ondertekening vir toetsing van die grondwetlikheid  daarvan
na die Grondwetlike Hof te verwys.

Ons in die Nuwe NP waardeer hierdie konstruktiewe  benadering  wat  dit  vir
ons moontlik maak om saam te help bou aan  Suid-Afrika,  ook  in  terme  van
transformasie. Daarom kan die Nuwe NP vandag, ook in hierdie Huis, sy  steun
aan  hierdie  belangrike  wetsontwerp,  wat  vandag  ter  tafel  gelê  word,
verleen. Ons steun ook die wysiging ten opsigte van die uitbreiding van  die
reg op vergoeding in die geval van effektiewe onteiening. Dit bring mee  dat
vergoeding ook  ná  die  oorgangstydperk  van  vyf  jaar  betaal  kan  word.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[However praiseworthy the principle of this Bill, with which the New  NP  in
principle wholeheartedly agrees, may be there are still aspects which  cause
concern. The most important of these are concerns  with  regard  to  tenure,
and the perception which exists of possible expropriations, as well  as  the
concern as to whether the prescripts, as contained in the Bill, comply  with
the principles of the Constitution.

It is therefore heartening that, after yesterday's debate  in  the  National
Assembly, and in consequence of the proposal by my New  NP  colleague  Maans
Nel, the Minister has undertaken to request the President to refer the  Bill
to the Constitutional  Court  before  signing  it,  in  order  to  test  its
constitutionality.

We in the New NP  appreciate  this  constructive  approach  which  makes  it
possible  for  us  to  help  build  South   Africa,   also   in   terms   of
transformation. Therefore the New NP can today, also  in  this  House,  lend
its support to this important Bill which is  being  tabled  today.  We  also
support the  amendment  with  regard  to  the  expansion  of  the  right  to
compensation in  the  case  of  effective  appropriation.  This  means  that
compensation can also be paid after the transitional period of  five  years.
[Applause.]]

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  today  marks  the
47th anniversary of the Freedom Charter, a noble  charter  which  represents
the aspirations and interests of millions of people in our society. It is  a
fitting tribute to our heroes and heroines of 1955 that today, on  the  47th
anniversary of the Freedom Charter, we have  before  us  such  an  important
piece of legislation which will contribute  to  the  transformation  of  our
country's economy.

The Freedom Charter  we  are  celebrating  today  emphasises  the  issue  of
economic growth and development. It states, and I quote:


  The people shall share in the country's wealth.

It further states:


  The national wealth of our country, the heritage of South Africans, shall
  be restored to the people; the mineral wealth beneath the soil, the Banks
  and monopoly industry shall be transferred to the people as a whole.

This is the spirit of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development  Bill,
a Bill which emphasises that  change  must  and  will  happen,  whether  big
mining companies like it or not. Our people have mandated  us  to  speed  up
change and that is exactly what we are doing with this Bill.
This Bill seeks to create opportunities for the opening  up  of  the  mining
industry, to ensure that it is no longer the domain of a privileged few.  It
is really explicit in its  endeavour  to  create  opportunities  for  market
access  for  the  previously  disadvantaged  communities.  Clause  12,   for
instance, deals extensively with this matter, and also  determines  adequate
measures for state involvement, through the  Minister,  to  ensure  that  we
assist the previously disadvantaged  communities.  It  states  that,  and  I
quote:


  The Minister may facilitate assistance to any historically  disadvantaged
  person to conduct prospecting or mining operations.

It further states that:


  The Minister must take into account all relevant factors, including -


  (a) the  need  to  promote  equitable  access  to  the  nation's  mineral
       resources;


  (b) the financial position of the applicant; and
  (c) the need to transform the ownership structure  of  the  minerals  and
       mining industry.

Clause 100 further emphasises the need to empower historically  disadvantage
people, by reaffirming:


  (a) to ensure the attainment of  Government's  objectives  of  redressing
       historical,  social  and  economic  inequalities  as  stated  in  the
       Constitution. The Minister must, within six months  of  the  date  on
       which this Act takes  effect,  develop  a  broad-based  socioeconomic
       empowerment charter that will set a framework, targets and  timetable
       for effecting the entry of historically disadvantaged South  Africans
       into the mining industry and allow such  South  Africans  to  benefit
       from the exploitation of mining and mineral resources.

Clearly, with this Bill in place, there is no way that  our  black  economic
empowerment  initiatives  can  fail.  With   this   Bill   our   agenda   of
deracialising our economy is gaining maximum momentum. Those who  refuse  to
join us on this journey of change and the hope for a  brighter  future:  the
winds of change will wither them away, and they should never blame  us  when
they find themselves on the periphery.

Here is an opportunity: the destiny of our mineral wealth  will  finally  be
in the hands of our people. Small-scale miners, black  economic  empowerment
companies,  community  co-operatives,  and  women's   and   young   people's
companies are all fully supporting this revolutionary piece of  legislation.
They support it precisely because it presents them with  an  opportunity  to
enter this market, without any of the major barriers which have  been  there
since we assumed our democratic order eight years ago.

For eight years we have been  embarking  on  a  process  that  will  forever
change our mining industry, to an industry which responds to the  challenges
of the new South African society. It is the duty of all  of  us  to  grapple
with these new exciting challenges posed to us by the Bill before us.

For big established companies such as De Beers, the  question  is:  How  are
they repositioning themselves to meet the  new  mandates?  These  are  clear
mandates, such as ensuring that new entrants into  the  market  are  getting
in, control and ownership of mineral wealth by the state, and a  better  and
improved  revolutionary  framework   that   ensures   that   we   meet   our
constitutional obligations. It is not better for big  capital  to  cry  foul
and complain forever. Let them join us on this exciting journey  of  change,
because change is inevitable in our new democratic order.

All of us, including big capital, have a role  to  play  in  rebuilding  our
country's  economy  in  pursuit  of  our  Reconstruction   and   Development
Programme. We will not attain our RDP goals with a fragmented economy  which
only serves a minority in our society. For the majority of our  people,  who
have been at the periphery of the mining industry, here  is  an  opportunity
qualitatively to improve the  living  conditions  of  our  people  by  being
active participants and not recipients, to  change  the  ownership  patterns
within this industry to be reflective of our society as a whole.

What we should avoid is the establishment  of  front  companies  which  will
serve the status quo as it is today. We should not  worry  about  those  who
complain, like the DA, that the  Minister  has  too  much  power,  precisely
because their problem is not with the Minister's power or with  security  of
tenure, but with the changes that this Bill seeks  to  bring  to  them,  and
therefore it is a bitter pill to swallow.

We should forgive them, because  they  have  imprisoned  themselves  in  the
racist jail of ``fight back'', and now they are unable  to  escape  or  free
themselves from  this  terrible  jail.  Therefore  we  must  not  take  them
seriously when they cry foul, as they represent no  constituency  but  their
own selfish interests.

Theirs is a campaign to ensure that Africans  continue  to  live  in  abject
poverty and underdevelopment. [Interjections.] They feel  bitter  when  they
see that we hold our destiny in our own hands and that  we  are  crafting  a
future which means prosperity for all South Africans and not a  select  few.
On this occasion we must therefore pardon them, because  it  is  typical  of
them to cry like small babies. On this occasion of the 47th  anniversary  of
the adoption of the Freedom Charter,  it  is  appropriate  for  the  ANC  to
support  this  Bill  thanking  our  veterans  of  1955  for  the   visionary
leadership they provided to all of us.

The DA failed to raise substantial issues in the committee. The  House  must
know that the hon Lever who is crying foul has  not  been  participating  in
the committee deliberations. He knew from the onset that  we  had  hearings.
The DA was not part of those hearings. This clearly shows that their  agenda
is to serve the racist few who  still  continue  to  cling  to  the  DA  and
believe  that  if  one  is  black,  one  is  unable  to   govern   properly.
[Interjections.] Therefore we must pardon them and request them to join  the
ship towards a better future, because racism in this country has no  future.
Those who cling to the racist past have no future. Please join  us  on  this
journey of change.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson,  I  thank  members  for  a
very stimulating debate. Mr Lucas, who spoke so eloquently,  happens  to  be
my partner as well ... [Interjections.] ... in that we share a  constituency
office in Douglas. [Laughter.] Yes, there was a worried man in  the  gallery
as I confessed! We also together grapple with the issues of the Xho and  the
Khoi who also have access to diamonds. So this Bill is  also  music  to  our
ears, because we may address the issues that we are both concerned about.

The more I listen to members speak about this Bill,  the  more  it  actually
sounds like a novel. It is such a nice Bill and such a nice story.  I  think
that in time even the DA will be able to find it in the  goodness  of  their
hearts - if  there  is  any  goodness  in  their  hearts  -  to  accept  the
importance of the Bill and the liberation it brings to them.

There are a few lessons that we have learned  in  the  process  of  debating
this Bill. One of those lessons is that bad advisers can mislead  themselves
and their clients. The lawyers of the industry really did  a  terrible  job,
because, as members can see, we have tried to look at all  the  issues.  Any
sensible lawyer would not have created the kind of problems that  we  almost
ended up with. But, of course these problems were averted,  because  as  the
mining companies took hold of the issues they  became  forward-looking,  and
as a result we ended this whole process on a very  high  note.  Even  though
they did not get everything they wanted, they are very  determined  to  make
it work.

Another lesson that I have learned from this process is  that  the  DA  does
not represent the mining industry. We always say that the DA represents  big
business and big interests. Big business wants to  run  away  from  the  DA,
because  the  DA  is  a  burden  and  a  millstone   around   their   necks.
[Interjections.] They should not speak to people who do not want the  DA  to
speak for them. The industry speaks to  us  because  they  know  who  is  in
power, and because they know that we are concerned about their  issues  they
can trust us.

We were supposed to have the biggest fight of the  century  with  Angloplat,
but as members can see, we  are  having  cake  with  them.  We  are  working
together to find a solution for the problems that they are facing  and  they
now understand that we could not have used this Bill to address  a  specific
problem. So the DA should go and campaign for members; they should  not  lay
claim to people who do not want the DA to represent them. [Interjections.]

They  were  so  desperate  that  they  even  tried  to  pretend  that   they
represented the traditionalists. Khawufan'  ucinge.  Bathi  bamele  iinkosi.
Ngoobani iinkosi? [Just imagine. They claim to be  representing  traditional
leaders. Who are the traditional leaders?] The chiefs came here  with  their
delegations in numbers yesterday to say: Hee bathong ha re  ba  batle  batho
bana; re a tseba go ipuella. [For  goodness  sake,  we  do  not  need  these
people; we can speak for ourselves.] So, as I stand here, I have  a  dynamic
relationship,  an  understanding  and  co-operation  with  the   traditional
communities. The DA should go and look for  other  people  whom  they  think
they are representing.

The polarisation and the doom that were being prophesied are  not  going  to
happen. Not only are we, as the department, ready to run with  the  ball  on
behalf of everybody; not only, as I said earlier, are we  known  for  taking
into account everybody's concerns, something that we will  continue  to  do;
we are also, with the assistance of the Minister  of  Finance,  getting  our
ducks in a row in order to make sure that on day one when this  becomes  law
we will be open for business. Hon members, the petrol price will come  down,
next week. [Applause.]
When members are at home they should drive around and talk about this  Bill.
Compose songs about it, go to communities  and  let  them  understand  that,
ifikile inkululeko [freedom has dawned]. Let us get our people  to  organise
around  quarries,  clay  and  all  those  other  small  resources   in   our
communities.  With  this  Bill  we  are  going  to  make  it  possible   for
municipalities to play a role in assisting  us  to  administer  those  small
reserves, so that they can be used for local economic activity. There is  no
sense in municipalities buying sandstone and construction material from  far
away and transporting it  for  construction  purposes  when  they  can  have
quarries, participate and assist their constituencies  to  benefit.  Members
should therefore make sure that they know about that, although we intend  to
have a road show to bring them up to speed.

Regarding the issue of the money Bill, both the Minister and  the  director-
general in the Treasury  are  working  on  it.  As  we  work  with  them  on
finalising the empowerment charter  and  the  social  plan,  they  are  also
working with us. We will  be  bringing  all  these  documents  together,  so
members should not worry. There will not be a problem as far  as  the  money
Bill is concerned.
I want to thank the hon members from the New NP  for  the  eloquent  way  in
which they have explained the advantages of the Bill. I also  want  to  tell
them, as one can see, we are not talking about  black  economic  empowerment
in this Bill but broad-based socioeconomic empowerment. This Bill will  also
benefit the small Afrikaner and white mine owners who must come together  so
that Ngcuka and Koekemoer can have a common mine. This is a new  opportunity
for everybody, for professionals to work together. So please let  them  know
that  there  are  opportunities  for  them  as  well  and   also   for   our
international investors.

We have world-class deposits in our country, as  the  hon  member  from  the
ACDP indicated, but there are amounts needed to get into this  industry.  We
understand that and we want our institutions to  be  part  of  the  support,
because we do  not  want  to  mess  up  the  industry.  As  I  said,  if  an
empowerment company is not willing to be operational and  to  get  training,
we do not want them to participate, because  then  they  are  thinking  that
they are doing this as a get-rich-quick scheme. It is not like that in  this
industry. One needs to invest, one needs time and one needs to  learn.  That
is why education is so central in this Bill.

I thank hon members, the presiding officers and staff for the  support  they
have given us to ensure that on this  day  we  are  here  to  celebrate  the
Freedom Charter by giving back to our  people  what  rightfully  belongs  to
them. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution  (Democratic  Party  dissenting)  (African  Christian
Democratic Party abstaining).

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                    (Consideration of Votes and Schedule)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, I have been  informed  that
there will be questions regarding the Votes  of  Ministers  present  in  the
House. Members will therefore have an opportunity  to  ask  the  responsible
Ministers questions.

Vote No 14 - Arts, Culture, Science and Technology:

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I want to remind the hon the Minister  that
some time ago Cabinet referred the draft Bill on multilingualism back for  a
survey to be done  on  the  cost  implications.  This  has  apparently  been
completed. In a reply earlier  the  hon  the  Minister  mentioned  that  the
legislation would be tabled as soon as some discussions  with  the  hon  the
Minister of Education had been completed.

My question is: Have the discussions with the hon the Minister of  Education
taken place? Have they been completed and  can  the  draft  now  be  put  to
Cabinet? Has it been done already or when is it going to be done? I  do  not
see any  reflection  of  any  implementation  of  the  language  legislation
reflected in the budgets of departments. Does this mean  that  we  will  not
see the implementation of  this  legislation  soon?  We  have  a  three-year
budget cycle, which means that if it is not reflected now, it will  only  be
in full operation in three or four  years'  time.  What  is  the  Minister's
opinion on this?

The  MINISTER  OF  ARTS,  CULTURE,  SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY:   Chairperson,
discussions with the Minister of Education have taken  place.  It  has  been
resolved that by the end of August the Department of Arts, Culture,  Science
and Technology, Pansalb and the Department of Education will have  clarified
various issues affecting specific departments, in particular the  Department
of Education. We have a task team established  for  this  purpose.  At  this
time,  the  national  language  plan  and  associated  legislation  will  be
submitted to Cabinet. This should not be surprising, because language  is  a
hugely emotive and very  practical,  down-to-earth  issue.  There  are  many
issues that have to be addressed, particularly in the education sector.

I would also like to correct the hon member about his understanding  of  the
MTF process, which is deficient to say the least. The  MTF  is  an  evolving
plan. We have every sector of our department within the  MTF,  but  when  we
revise during this budget cycle, we might find that we prioritise  something
because it has become necessary to prioritise it, and for  other  things  to
be addressed  later.  There  is  always  a  window  of  opportunity  to  get
prioritisation within the MTF.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I thank the Minister  for  his  reply,  and
especially for the information about the window of opportunity,  because  we
will need that in the very near  future.  The  Minister  mentioned  Pansalb.
When I look at Pansalb's budget, I do not see  a  large  proportion  of  the
budget being allocated for resolving language violations.  Is  that  because
the Minister is involved in amending the Pansalb Act  to  provide  for  more
enforcement? Did Pansalb  consult  the  Minister  about  this  or  does  the
Minister leave Pansalb to handle this on their own?

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson, I  would
like to tell the hon member that we are not contemplating any  amendment  to
Pansalb legislation at this stage. We believe the  current  legislation  and
the courts provide adequate mechanisms. Pansalb is obviously the  body  that
looks after language interests -  equity,  as  well  as  the  promotion  and
development of  each  language.  It  is  the  duty  of  Pansalb  to  promote
languages.

If there are complaints, as there have been, Pansalb does give  a  point  of
view. For instance, in the case of number plate registrations  in  the  Free
State, Pansalb gave a point of view, but unfortunately it is not binding  on
the provincial government or other institutions. The  courts  are  there  to
refer Pansalb's recommendations or views for litigation, if need be.

We have not yet established fully the commission on religious  and  language
matters. In my view, that is where  real  processes  will  take  place  with
regard to complaints, abuse and so on.

Vote 15 - Education:

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I would like  to  know  from  the  hon  the
Deputy Minister whether it is his and his department's intention  to  assist
indigenous languages to develop to university level by giving this  specific
responsibility and financial support to specific  universities.  And  to  go
with that, will the hon the Deputy Minister  assist  historically  Afrikaans
universities to be accessible to learners from  other  language  groups,  by
specific  funding  for  the  implementation  of  parallel  and   dual-medium
teaching where a university decides to alter  or  has  already  altered  its
approach  in  that  direction?  Will  this  also  be  available  to  English
universities if they wish to implement this option?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, that is  a  mouthful.  It  is
indeed the intention of the Ministry  of  Education  to  promote  indigenous
languages, to start with at school level. We are not  satisfied  that  there
is  sufficient  promotion  and  learning  of  indigenous  languages  in  our
schools.  And,  definitely,  it  is  the   intention,   as   part   of   the
transformation of higher education, to ensure that indigenous languages  are
offered and provided for on a much larger scale than  is  the  case  at  the
moment. We know that there is  a  decline  in  the  offering  and  study  of
indigenous languages at our universities.

In  our  policy  documents,  we  have  already   declared   that   Afrikaans
universities should offer parallel-medium instruction,  especially  in  rare
subjects such as engineering, medicine and so forth. We  hope  that  in  due
course, when this process has been  completed,  we  will  have  a  situation
where there is greater access to these universities  by  people  other  than
traditional Afrikaans speakers.

As to whether English universities will also be required  to  do  the  same,
this will be, as I have indicated, part of the process of transformation  of
the higher education system, which we are engaged in at the moment.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I would like  to  ask  just  one  follow-up
question, and this is not a mouthful. Would  the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister
support the principle that there can be universities with a  language  other
than English as the main language of instruction at undergraduate level?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, in principle,  yes,  I  would
support that. We are hoping that things will move beyond what  we  have  had
so far, where the universities where either English or  Afrikaans,  so  that
with the passage of time, indigenous languages will not only be  offered  as
languages in  their  own  right,  but  as  mediums  of  instruction  at  our
universities. We believe that this is possible, but for that to happen,  all
of us will have to change our mind-sets.

Many of us, while we might sometimes  disagree  with  some  of  the  reasons
Afrikaans speakers are so  adamant  to  have  Afrikaans  universities,  also
admire the fact that Afrikaans-speaking people stand up for their  language.
They want to promote it. We hope we can say the same for other languages  in
our country. The day we have people toyi-toying for various languages,  that
they should  be  taught  at  schools  and  universities,  we  will  see  the
Department of Education moving faster to ensure that all our languages  have
a place in our education system, right up to universities, where we hope  to
create chairs for these languages in due course.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I would like to ask a very short  question.
I thank the hon the  Deputy  Minister.  I  can  assure  him  that  from  the
Afrikaans community there is a lot of goodwill and  a  lot  of  knowhow,  to
assist in the process of helping the other languages, as we are  doing  with
the lexicography already.

My question is: Does  the  Deputy  Minister  agree  that  the  institutional
character and language policy of a university should be  determined  by  the
university council, so as to adhere to their constitution,  and  should  not
be enforced from somewhere else?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, the university  council  will
have a role, but we have to look at the national picture, where  all  of  us
want to go as a country. If we are going to allow each council to decide  on
such matters exclusively,  then  we  might  not  be  able  to  move  in  the
direction in which we want to move as a nation and a country.

So, yes, I agree that the councils will have a role and a voice, and a  good
voice at that, but I do not think that they will have  the  exclusive  right
to decide on this question.

Vote No 1 - The Presidency - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, in support of the Vote  of  the  President,  we
know that succeeding an icon like former President Nelson Mandela was  never
going to be easy, but we are also  aware  that  President  Mbeki  has  spent
almost his entire adult life in the ranks of the ANC, and was  born  into  a
family  with  a  distinguished  ANC  pedigree,  and  we  are  therefore  not
surprised that he is taking our hardwon democracy and  our  continent  to  a
breathtaking new step on  the  ladder  of  social,  economic  and  political
progress.

Very often people forget or simply fail to recognise the  sheer  breadth  of
the effort to repair the past, and the extent to which the President  exerts
himself to that end. The present progress in ensuring an improved system  of
governance and the promotion  of  peace  on  the  continent  are  reasonably
strong.

The President is noted  for  his  achievement  in  engaging  with  different
sectors of our society to strategise, plan  and  share  ideas  on  the  best
possible ways of lending a hand in the national  effort  to  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty. In addition to the local partnerships,  the  President
is  astute  in  attracting  members  of  the  international   community   to
participate in our development agenda. The  creation  of  the  International
Investment Council and the Presidential International  Advisory  Council  on
Information Society and Development are positive outcomes of  the  political
leadership of our President.

At the intragovernmental level, the President persistently gives  effect  to
the principle of co-operative  governance.  The  Presidential  Co-ordinating
Council, consisting of the  Presidency,  all  the  premiers,  the  SA  Local
Government  Association  and  the  Ministers   of   provincial   and   local
government, is a strong indication of this.  This  has  also  brought  about
many positive results, including more efficient  management  of  budgets  as
well as faster implementation of programmes and improvement in  the  quality
of outcomes of Government  work.  The  improved  co-ordination  between  the
different spheres of government, as well as among various  departments,  has
brought about better  policy  alignment  and  proper  collaboration  on  the
delivery of projects.

The  present  vision  for  the  renewal  of   the   African   continent   is
unprecedented. The citizens of this continent are no  longer  mere  dreamers
of a renaissance for our giant  continent,  but  are  able  to  observe  the
making of an African century. Therefore,  the  President's  foreign  travels
are not in vain, nor are they fruitless and without reason.

About two weeks ago the President launched an  undersea  fibre  optic  cable
project,  spearheaded  by  Telkom  as  part  of  our  efforts   to   promote
connectivity between Africa and the rest of the  world.  This  project  will
link Asia, Africa and Europe, via South Africa, with landing  points  in  14
countries in West and Southern Africa, and will have the capacity to  handle
5,8 million simultaneous telephone calls between Africa and Europe  and  6,2
million calls between Africa and  Asia.  This  will  bring  to  an  end  the
abnormal situation in terms of  which,  Africans  telephoning  one  another,
even connecting to neighbouring  countries,  were  routed  via  one  of  the
former European colonial countries.

Therefore, the ANC supports the budget. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 2 - Parliament - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, members will agree that if one  cannot  put  the
case of one's electors, one is severely  constrained  in  Parliament.  One's
liberty and therefore the liberty of those who  elected  one  are  affected.
One needs a certain minimum period to put and motivate anything  approaching
a case in Parliament. Because speaking time  is  proportionally  calculated,
the ACDP is effectively precluded  from  putting  well-motivated  points  of
view in debate. We usually have two, three or four minutes  to  speak,  when
other parties have hours.

We would like to propose that all  party  spokesmen  to  any  debate  get  a
minimum of four minutes, and that the balance of the time be  proportionally
calculated. Parties smaller than the ACDP are even more constrained. In  the
Other Place, there are parties that get 30 seconds and one minute  to  speak
in the Assembly. And I know that the Speaker in  the  Other  Place  is  very
concerned about that. It is clearly ludicrous. [Interjections.]

That hon member must  remember  that  the  history  of  the  world  is  that
majorities have so often  been  wrong.  She  is  a  good  example  of  that,
representative of a majority that is very often wrong.

I am serious about this, because I am trying to improve the liberty  of  our
people. The situation is clearly wrong, undemocratic and ineffective.

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Chairperson, on a point of order:  I  really  cannot  see
any significant and explicit relevance of speaking time to the Vote.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  I  think  we
should stick to the Vote, hon Durr. I  thought  somebody  would  raise  that
point of order.

Mr K D S DURR: If I may conclude, Chairperson, I ask you just  to  hear  our
arguments.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP [Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  On  the  Vote,
yes. [Laughter.]

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 3 - Foreign Affairs - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, we know that there is a saying  -  the  hon  the
Minister of Finance would know this - that  everybody  agrees  with  general
saving but particular expenditure. We cannot support this  Vote  because  we
feel that the department, although generally it has  done  a  good  job,  in
particular it has done rather badly. We think in particular of the way  that
effectively the department has turned a blind  eye  when  it  comes  to  the
particular case of that rogue state Zimbabwe on our frontiers.

It is a state that, in the middle of  a  famine,  closes  down  60%  of  the
production of its commercial farms, a country which  has  violated  all  the
precepts of justice, press freedom and good governance, a  state  which  has
stripped $18 billion in private assets from its  citizens  over  two  years,
cloning past injustice, when 83% of the  assets  which  they  stripped  were
created after independence in 1980, with government approval.

We are quick to comment on every development in Israel, Palestine and  other
parts of the world, where our judgment and our influence is small.  However,
in Zimbabwe where our influence is great, we continue effectively to  shield
a monster that is leading his country to disaster. On that basis  we  oppose
the Vote. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of  the  Constitution  (African
Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 4 - Home Affairs - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairperson, our opposition to this  Vote  is  based  upon
the failure to produce  a  satisfactory  immigration  Bill  and  immigration
arrangements, which are desperately required by our country,  and  the  fact
that we are concerned that the department is to receive  R300  million  less
than was requested; I understand that nearly R120 million  of  those  moneys
are related to what they call critical service delivery.

I feel bad about saying this, because, in a way,  I  think  that  Parliament
has let the Minister down badly. I apologise to the  Minister.  I  sincerely
do so. Parliament has let him down in that we have failed to produce  a  law
which allows him to  govern  effectively  in  this  important  part  of  his
portfolio, namely immigration. I am concerned about that. It  is  vital  for
our  country  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  its  frontiers  as  far   as
immigration is concerned.

On that basis we will not oppose this, but  we  register  our  objection  to
this Vote.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government - put.
Declarations of vote:

Ms C BOTHA: Mr Chairperson, municipalities are in their  infancy,  yet  they
are  now  faced  with  a  political  situation   which   closely   resembles
infanticide. This is going to bring about major disruptions  at  prohibitive
cost to the hapless ratepayers.

We  will  have  changes,  from  mayoral  committees  to  executive   mayors,
reappointment of municipal managers with attendant costs, and  the  breaking
up of hardwon working relationships. This is alienating  meaningful  numbers
of voters who may be permanently unwilling to get involved in what they  see
as the mercenary manipulation of mindless politicians.

Service delivery is bound to suffer again. This highlights the existence  of
an already very limited understanding  of  budgets  and  the  tax  base  or,
worse, cynical disregard of sound financial principles  by  councillors,  if
we look at the shocking figures issued by the department, that only  34%  of
municipalities  have  financial  controls  in  place  and  only   29%   have
accounting policies.

Expenditure on personnel is rising much faster than expenditure  on  capital
projects. Free State farm land is being  valued  and  taxed  on  an  ad  hoc
basis, in a process which shows no awareness of  the  link  between  service
delivery and rates.

Against this background, I am very concerned about the sound application  of
the R30 billion allocated  to  municipal  government  over  the  next  three
years. How will the Minister ensure that the voter  gets  value  for  money?
After all, it is us here who are really contributing to  the  tax  which  is
funding  local  government  expenditure.  We  want  it  to  go  towards  the
improvement of services and free basic services to the poor, not more  perks
for councillors or more executive mayors.

I think, with this background, the Minister realises that there  is  no  way
that we can possibly support the Vote,  until  such  time  as  the  Minister
comes with measures to safeguard the debt situation which has  developed  in
this country, which has  apparently tripled to R22 billion in the  past  two
years. It is as unacceptable politically as it is  economically  foolish  to
expect an ever-decreasing number of dutiful ratepayers to carry the cost  of
an ever-increasing number of defaulters.

Against this background it is,  unfortunately,  impossible  for  the  DP  to
support this Vote.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Mr Chairperson, the new  system  of  local  government  is
still evolving, but is well on  track.  Local  government,  in  general,  is
performing fairly well under the  system.  The  necessary  systems  in  most
municipalities are in place and the new free  basic  services  are  also  in
place but still evolving.

We must note that,  in  assessing  the  performance  of  municipalities  and
cities, it is not the net sum, the balancing of figures  or  the  number  of
meetings that we should assess, but we should include the  participation  of
the communities, and the quality of the meetings and  all  resolutions  that
are being taken. Because  the  system  is  so  responsible,  accessible  and
accountable, people are able to render this criticism we have just heard.

The intergovernmental relations system is intended as a  support  for  local
government, and is  now  obligatory  since  being  enacted  by  legislation,
rather than being an act of  benevolence  as  was  the  case  in  the  past.
Intervention takes place  in  support  of  local  government,  in  terms  of
section 155, and less and less in terms of section 139, which in a  way  was
some sort of take-over.

We must realise that democracy has its costs, which are  unavoidable  if  we
are  to  have  effective  delivery  and  an  accountable  system  of   local
government. We have no option but to support this  evolving  new  system  of
local government. [Applause.]

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, the New NP will  support  this  Vote.  Our  new
local government system has been in place for a year and a half. There  were
ups and downs, but in general it is going well with our local government.

I just want to put on the  table  that  the  Council  must  take  note  that
political parties in their declarations talk about mindless politicians  and
the instability of local government, but this Council must  take  note  that
the DP/DA in this Council fired nine councillors  in  the  unicity  of  Cape
Town, creating instability in the unicity  of  Cape  Town.  [Interjections.]
Further, the unicity cancelled their meeting because they could not  have  a
meeting because they had fired their councillors. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  member,
can you take your seat? Mrs Versfeld, on what are you rising?

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, on a point of order: I would like the  member
to stick to the Vote, please. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES (Mr M L Mushwana): Mr Ackermann,  speak
to the Vote, please.

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I will speak to the Vote. I have been  speaking
on the Vote, but it seems to me that the hon member  does  not  want  me  to
speak on the Vote. The point  is  that  in  the  unicity  of  Cape  Town,  a
situation of instability has been created  by  the  same  party  that  talks
about instability in local government in South Africa.

There is no government in the unicity, and Capetonians must live  with  this
because of that party's decision  to  fire  councillors.  Then  they  cancel
their meetings, and they decide not to have them. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Yes, I can  see
members are becoming like popcorn now.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 6 - Public Works - put and agreed to in accordance with  section  75
of the Constitution.

Vote No 7 - Government Communication and Information System - put.

Declaration of vote:

Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson, I was expecting the DP to be singing  the  same
song. As the ANC was saying, the aims of GCIS are to develop  and  implement
marketing,  media  placement  and  distribution  strategies  for  GCIS   and
Government,  to  develop  a  context  strategy  using   key   messages   for
information products producing Government for the South African public,  and
to develop  information  products  that  meet  the  communication  needs  of
Government and the information needs of the South African public.

In the time scale of our young democracy, a department  entering  its  fifth
year must be  counted  amongst  established  institutions  and  it  must  be
assessed as such, on the basis of its performance. It must be  assessed  not
only by its success in breaking with the past, but by its responsiveness  to
the needs of the moment and its sensitivity to future  trends.  It  must  be
measured by the degree to which our Government as a whole  is  communicating
in a way that assists the people of South Africa to participate actively  in
improving their own lives, and in the governance of our country.

Indeed,  it  is  precisely  these   directions   that   define   the   major
communications  initiatives  in  which  the  Government  Communication   and
Information System has been involved during the past year, and which  it  is
planning for the coming  year.  The  list  includes  multipurpose  community
centres, the international marketing campaign Imbizo, the  redesign  of  our
national orders and multimedia mass communication campaigns.

These  are  all  about  Government   and   society   acting   together   for
transformation that eradicates the  legacy  of  apartheid.  They  are  about
uniting a nation in pursuit  of  a  better  life  for  all  South  Africans,
especially the poor. Bringing Government close to the  people,  and  to  the
poor  in  particular  means  extending  the  infrastructure  of   Government
information and services  into  previously  neglected  communities,  as  the
Minister was saying yesterday.

The imperative of doing this in an integrated way  is  a  central  tenet  of
this Government's programme. Public understanding of this need has  deepened
through media focus on the distress  of  families  unable  to  access  child
support grants for lack of birth certificates and ID  books,  especially  in
my area. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 8 - National Treasury - put and agreed to in accordance  to  section
75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 9 - Public Enterprises - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, we have serious reservations,  which  are  based
upon the failure of this department to give momentum  to  its  own  and  the
Government's  declared  privatisation  programme.  So  often  one  hears  of
investors that wish to invest in South Africa, participate in South  Africa,
but the opportunities to do so are simply not there.

Given the fact that our infrastructure is beginning to creak  at  the  seams
and requires urgent  investment  -  and  I  congratulate  the  Minister  for
applying increased management to capital  expenditure  programmes  in  South
Africa; we are aware of that and we value that - the fact is that there  are
certain investments such as  our  ports,  for  example,  that  require  huge
amounts of capital, and we need to accelerate the process of investment.  We
can only do that by privatisation, and  we  find  that  this  department  is
certainly not moving quickly enough.

Privatisation attracts capital and investment on a huge scale,  beyond  that
which Government can sensibly expend. That is why  the  world  has  gone  in
this direction. The state cannot and does not create wealth; at best it  can
and should provide a climate,  a  structure  and  an  infrastructure  within
which wealth can be created by the private sector.

Just one experience, which I shared with somebody the other day, is that  in
the UK an outright privatisation of their  ports  showed  that  the  capital
investment grew by 50% in a decade, turnover and tonnage of  cargo  grew  by
20% each, labour costs fell by 40% and  profitability  grew  by  220%.  And,
from being the sick ports of Europe, UK ports are  now  reportedly  some  of
the most efficient in Europe.

If we look at the capital requirements we have in respect of ports  such  as
Durban and Cape Town, we really think  that  Public  Enterprises  should  do
more in this direction. It is for that  reason  that  we  have  reservations
about this Vote.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Can I get  that
clear, Mr Durr. Is that a reservation or an objection?

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, it is an objection.

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, before moving to Vote 10, the New NP was  supposed
to make a declaration on Public Enterprises.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  would  ask
members to raise their hands so that I can see them. Yes,  hon  member,  you
may proceed.

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, I am not a member of the New NP.  I  am  making  a
declaration on behalf of the ANC.

I would like to say that, as South  Africa,  we  do  appreciate  investments
coming into our country. We are also looking at privatisation,  but  we  are
not rushing into that, for the reason that we do not want to find  ourselves
in a situation in which our people are left  unemployed.  So,  we  are  also
looking at the  question  of  ensuring  that  the  playing  field  is  being
levelled.

I would like the House to note that Public Enterprises has made  significant
progress with regard to key sectoral policies  such  as  telecommunications,
energy, ming and ports. These policies and legal frameworks  lay  the  basis
for accelerated restructuring for the year 2001-02, and, to the  ACDP,  this
is  continuing.  A  culture  of  co-operative  governance   in   state-owned
enterprises and the strengthening of the boards, conclusion  of  shareholder
compacts and a framework for managing shareholder interests are all  on  the
department's programme.

Allow me also to say that there was a budget decline as a  result  of  once-
off expenditure on special advisory services and marketing costs related  to
the Telkom initial public offering, which was finalised. We also  appreciate
that there has been an increase  in  the  expenditure  on  professional  and
special services through performance monitoring and benchmarking. It is  the
department's intention to increase its capacity to monitor and evaluate  the
performance of state-owned enterprises.

As the ANC we support the Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution

Vote No 14 - Arts, Culture, Science and Technology - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on this side we have some records that  got
stuck on the word ``none''. [Laughter.]

Although I know that multilingualism is  only  one  facet  of  the  hon  the
Minister's  responsibilities,  it  is  true  that  multilingualism   is   an
expensive exercise. But, peace, empowerment and a  sense  of  belonging  are
very  valuable  assets  to  a  nation.  We  must  be  careful  not  to   put
multilingualism on the list of  priorities  of  the  Government  because  it
cannot compete with crime, poverty relief and  others  that  are  much  more
important. But multilingualism is at the heart of each of those  priorities,
and that is the way we must look at it.

I hope that the commission for the  promotion  and  protection  of  culture,
language and religious community rights  will  eventually  be  part  of  the
Minister's responsibility, because that, with Pansalb, forms  a  cluster  in
this regard. We will then have a talk on enforcement powers  again.  I  must
admit that I  was  astounded  when  the  hon  the  Minister  said  that  the
recommendations from the Pansalb Board in connection with  the   enforcement
powers for Pansalb were no longer on the table. I would really like to  talk
to the Minister about that later on. That was a bit of a shock.

With the commitment of  the  Minister  and  his  department  to  making  the
conditions and spirit of  the  South  African  Constitution  a  reality,  we
cannot do anything but say: Ons ondersteun die  begrotingopos.  [We  support
the Vote.]

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 15 - Education - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, I rise on  behalf  of  my  party,  the  ANC,  to
declare our unequivocal support  for  Vote  15,  an  Education  budget  that
reaches every ventricle of our country's education system, namely  reception
to Grade 9, general and further education and training, and adult  learning.


This country's commitment to education  is  particularly  reflected  in  the
proportion of national public spending devoted to education. It is  accorded
the  single  largest  portion  of  the  national  Budget  of  all   sectors.
Significant for us as the ANC, is the fact that education  in  this  country
is no longer racially segregated.  Moreover,  this  budget  is  also  geared
towards the strengthening of systematic reforms which are aimed  at  greater
accountability for performance across the spectrum.

This budget has  met  all  the  requirements  for  and  expectations  of  an
education sector in transition, and it  is  another  step  in  removing  the
massive scaffolding of apartheid education, whilst we are at the  same  time
tasting the sweet fruit of success and remarkable progress. It is  therefore
against this backdrop of unparalleled commitment in the spirit  of  Tirisano
and Vuk'uzenzele that we support this budget in full.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the New NP voted against this Vote  in  the
National Assembly because we could not get clarity or assurance  on  certain
issues affecting Afrikaans and the other indigenous languages in  education.
[Interjections.] After the Deputy Minister's replies to my questions  and  a
private discussion earlier today with the hon the Minister, Prof Asmal,  and
his director-general, and with the assurance that  the  Minister's  language
policy will be tabled very soon, even by  the  end  of  July,  many  of  the
aforementioned issues are being addressed. We not  only  hope,  but  we  are
fairly sure that when this policy is tabled and available, and becomes  part
of the department's policy, we will be able to  support  the  Minister.  But
until then, we will stick to our former position and we  will  vote  against
the Vote.

To stress how important this issue of the threat to Afrikaans  and  some  of
the other indigenous languages in higher  education  is  to  our  party,  it
should be noted that this is the only Vote we voted  against  in  the  other
House, and will vote against in this House, and we hope that the  negativity
around this whole issue of Afrikaans in higher education  will  be  resolved
soon and that the  perceptions  will  be  cleared,  so  that  everybody  can
consolidate and really work towards quality education for all the people  of
South Africa.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson and hon Ministers, what my  party  cannot  deny  is
that the Department of Education has taken  many  strides  in  putting  into
place a good policy framework for the promotion  of  education,  from  early
childhood education to the higher education levels.

However, where  it  matters  most,  in  the  classrooms  and  many  schools,
conditions are not really conducive to  wholesome  education,  this  despite
the  yeomanly  efforts  of  a  hard-working,  industrious   and   innovative
Minister. In the Minister's own fifth report to the President,  the  despair
and frustration of the well-meaning hon  Minister  are  eloquently  captured
when he decries the provinces for being guilty of not making optimum use  of
conditional grants.

At present, thousands of schools are overcrowded. Thousands of learners  are
still expected to produce results when they suffer from a shortage of  basic
needs such as textbooks, desks, laboratories, libraries, and even water  and
electricity.

Provinces are guilty of underspending on  infrastructural  development.  And
who suffers? It is the  historically  disadvantaged  learners.  Do  we  then
question why some schools produce poor  academic  results?  In  the  Eastern
Cape,  for  example,  critical   shortages   of   textbooks   have   plagued
schoolchildren, and continue to do so even at this  present  moment.  In  my
province, KwaZulu-Natal, overcrowding is still a huge problem. In  addition,
the school feeding scheme,  that  is,  the  nutrition  programme,  is  in  a
shambles. Lack of proper monitoring and allocation  of  funds,  self-seeking
principals and management personnel have resulted in  fraud  and  corruption
taking hold.

The DP cannot support the education Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party, New  National  Party  and  African  Christian  Democratic
Party dissenting).

Vote No 16 - Health - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Chairperson, the DP does not support the health  Vote.  Our
vote is a strong demonstration of condemnation of the  department's  failure
to provide health services in some provinces, where the Eastern Cape is  the
most telling example. By this vote, we call on the Minister to intervene  in
the province. [Interjections.] Excuse me, can  I  finish?  We  call  on  the
Minister to intervene in  the  province  to  stop  the  collapse  of  health
services caused by incompetence and indolent officials,  including  relevant
MECs.

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, on behalf of the ANC I rise in  support  of  Vote
No 16 - the Health Vote - because we believe that the Department  of  Health
is on course. The budget demonstrates in no uncertain terms the  seriousness
with which this Government treats the HIV/Aids pandemic  and  the  potential
devastation it may cause our nation.

Proof of this lies in the  strategic  approach  to  budgeting  for  HIV/Aids
developed and adopted by the Department of Health in collaboration with  the
Departments of  Social  Development  and  of  Education,  and  the  National
Treasury. This  enhanced  response  to  HIV/Aids  and  sexually  transmitted
diseases is based on an integrated interdepartmental approach.

This, we believe, will allow  for  expenditure  to  flow  through  all  nine
provinces  systematically,   thus   ensuring   that   programmes   promoting
preventive intervention, life-skills  training,  voluntary  counselling  and
testing, prevention of  mother-to-child  transmission,  and  home-based  and
step-down care are well organised and effective.

The ANC also welcomes the reformulation of the Hospital  Reconstruction  and
Rehabilitation  Conditional   Grant   into   the   new   Health   Facilities
Revitalisation Grant. We note that the provinces will rise to the  challenge
and take responsibility  for  ongoing  maintenance,  thereby  ensuring  that
public buildings providing valuable health services are properly  maintained
and the community is appropriately cared for.

Our priority as the ANC has always been to make sure that  our  rural  areas
have access to proper health care  professionals  and  quality  health  care
services.  Within  the  National  Tertiary   Services   Grant   and   health
professions and training grants, the department nationally and  provincially
will be able to recruit and train medical specialists to service  especially
those provinces where these services and professionals are most needed.

For  all  these  reasons  and  many  more  the  ANC  supports  Vote  No  16.
[Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Mnr die Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP steun  die  begrotingspos.  My
party het groot waardering vir die belangrike aksies wat oor 'n wye  terrein
van MIV/vigs-bekamping van stapel gestuur word, asook die beduidende  fondse
wat   hiervoor   beskikbaar   gestel   word.   Ons   steun   dan   ook   die
hospitaalrehabilitasieprogram. Dit is 'n goeie  voorbeeld  van  waar  fondse
goed aangewend word.  In  die  gebied  waar  ek  vandaan  kom,  het  hierdie
vernuwingsprogram 'n tasbare en merkbare positiewe effek, nie alleen op  die
estetiese vlak nie, maar ook op pasiënte en personeel se moraal.

Ons  is  egter   bekommerd   oor   die   skynbaar   totale   administratiewe
ineenstorting in die Oos-Kaap se gesondheidsektor, veral  in  die  chroniese
hospitale. Ons is dankbaar  dat  die  agb  Minister  ingestem  het  om  môre
persoonlik die streek te besoek, om haar te vergewis van wat  daar  aangaan.
Dit is belangrik dat hierdie geval dringend aangespreek word.

Nog 'n aspek wat  kommerwekkend  is,  is  die  sogenaamde  ``brain  drain''.
Syfers dui daarop dat tot een derde van pasgekwalifiseerde dokters die  land
verlaat. Ons wil die Regering aanmoedig om hierdie probleem dringend aan  te
spreek.

Die Nuwe NP steun die begrotingspos. [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chairman, the New NP  supports  the  Vote.  My  party  has
great appreciation for the important actions that are being launched over  a
wide spectrum in the combating of  HIV/Aids,  as  well  as  the  significant
funds that are being made available for this. We also support  the  hospital
rehabilitation programme. This is a good example of where  funds  are  being
utilised well. In the area I come from, this renewal  programme  has  had  a
tangible and visibly positive effect, not only at the aesthetic  level,  but
also on the morale of patients and staff.

However,  we  are  concerned  about  what  would  appear  to  be  the  total
administrative  collapse  in  the  health  sector  of  the   Eastern   Cape,
especially in chronic hospitals. We are grateful that the hon  the  Minister
has agreed to visit the area in person tomorrow in order to  ascertain  what
is happening there. It is important that this  matter  should  be  addressed
urgently.

Another aspect that is a cause for concern is  the  so-called  brain  drain.
Figures indicate that up to one third of newly qualified doctors  leave  the
country. We want  to  encourage  the  Government  to  address  this  problem
urgently. The New NP supports the Vote. [Applause.]]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 17 - Housing - put and agreed to in accordance with  section  75  of
the Constitution.

Vote No 18 - Social Development - put  and  agreed  to  in  accordance  with
section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 19 - Sport and Recreation South Africa - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, hon Ministers and members, I am proud to  rise  on
behalf of my party, the ANC, in support of Vote No 19: Sport and  Recreation
South Africa.

Let me start by saying to the opposition that the issues  of  transformation
and representivity are non-negotiable at this juncture  in  the  history  of
our country. Some members are obviously very jealous of the achievements  of
the hon the Minister of Sport and Recreation and  his  department  and  have
gone to  great  lengths  to  create  a  blurred  picture  in  the  minds  of
sportspeople in general.

It is these individuals and political parties, the DP especially,  who  have
no idea of the frustrations of black sportspeople. However, the majority  of
sportspersons from the hitherto advantaged groups are in accord with  us  on
the score and we value their contribution to the levelling  of  the  playing
field.

At the national level, the Ministry has put  numerous  programmes  in  place
which are unprecedented in the history of  this  country,  for  example  the
youth in future, Siyadlala and television programmes  dedicated  to  raising
the profiles of our young sportspeople and getting the nation to play  which
has been run through the provincial departments. Also, what  is  significant
is the announcement by Minister Balfour regarding  his  concerns  about  the
slow progress of indigenous games and of women in sport.

All of us here, and the provincial  delegates,  know  the  extent  to  which
sport and recreation are contributing to the betterment of the lives of  our
people.  Moreover,  we  are  at  the  coalface  of  the  upgrading  of   the
infrastructure and the erection of new facilities in our  provinces  and  at
local level. We want to put on record that we are indeed proud  of  the  co-
operation among the national, provincial and local  governments  on  matters
of sport.

As the ANC we have led the  way  in  the  normalisation  of  sport  for  all
groups, regardless of gender, race or affiliation in this  country,  and  we
shall continue to do so. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 20 - Correctional Services - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mof J L KGOALI: Modulasetulo, ha nke ke lebohe monyetla oo  ke  o  fumanang.

[Mrs J L KGOALI: Hon Chairperson, I would like to say  thank  you  for  this
opportunity. I would like to state categorically and clearly that since  the
ANC came into power in 1994 it has brought about changes  that  resulted  in
many people being able to air their views.

During the previous regime, prisoners  were  regarded  as  people  who  only
deserved to be thrown into jail, without  being  given  any  opportunity  of
rehabilitation. The ANC has since decided that prisoners  are  people;  that
they have rights and that they deserve to be  duly  respected  and  provided
with opportunities that will turn them into people who  will  be  acceptable
when they finally return to the community.

Providing the Department of Correctional Services with  funds  is  therefore
highly appreciated by the ANC. [Applause.]]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 21 - Defence - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, personnel expenditure,  with  the  exclusion  of
the arms deal, constitutes an unsatisfactory 50%  of  the  total  budget  of
Defence, which is simply caused  by  too  many  generals  and  senior  staff
within the department. South Africa's ratio of one  general  for  every  245
privates competes extremely poorly with the ratios of other countries.

It is extremely ironic that in the  new  democratic  South  Africa,  Defence
spending  has  risen  to  similar  importance  to  that  of   the   previous
dispensation. In fact, the Department of  Defence  has  been  allocated  the
second biggest budget, totalling R18,4 billion. We feel that the  priorities
are wrong and that much of this spending should have gone  towards  creating
more jobs and increased  economic  growth.  Social  spending  and  education
should also have received a cut of this spending on the wrong priorities.

Government has indicated to the public that the cost of  the  arms  deal  is
R52,7 billion, whereas the figure can roughly be  doubled  owing  to,  inter
alia, finance costs. In the 2002  appropriation  Bill,  Defence  is  getting
R3,9 billion over the three-year  MTEF  period  for  currency  depreciation.
This  clearly  illustrates  the  consequences  of  spending  on  the   wrong
priorities. It is clear that the Department of Defence, with the  assistance
of the Minister of Defence, has made it impossible for  the  DP  to  support
this Vote.

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, Minister and Deputy Minister, we  support  this
Vote because we believe the allocation given by  Parliament to our  national
Defence Force will enable it to carry out its functions which are,  firstly,
to provide core defence capabilities for the defence of our country  against
any external or internal threat; secondly, to provide a military  capability
to participate in  regional  and  international  peace  support  operations;
thirdly, to provide a capability  to  uphold  peace  and  stability  in  co-
operation with the SAPS; fourthly, to provide surveillance  and  enforcement
support for  relevant  authorities  mandated  with  the  protection  of  our
maritime marine resources; and fifthly, to  provide  emergency  capabilities
for the maintenance of essential services  in  cases  of  severe  floods  or
draught.

I honestly cannot understand how the DP  can  oppose  this  Vote.  Are  they
telling our young men and women who serve  in  the  national  Defence  Force
that they are not worthy of the amount of  money  that  is  being  spent  on
them? Are they saying to these young men and women that they do not  deserve
to be equipped with the capability which will enable  them  to  serve  their
country with pride?

One can ask the seamen at Simon's Town naval base and  they  will  tell  one
that our country is a maritime country which needs  a  maritime  capability.
There is no single major maritime country without a  navy.  They  will  tell
one that our naval equipment is so old that it needs  to  be  replaced.  Our
naval equipment has become more expensive to maintain and repair than  would
cost to replace it.

If those who oppose this Bill, such as the DP, could make  a  little  effort
to visit the various arms of our national Defence Force, they would  realise
the important role it plays in the reconstruction and  development  process.
If they go out to the naval base in Gordon's Bay here in the  Western  Cape,
they would find that the navy is making  an  enormous  contribution  towards
equipping  our  servicemen  and  servicewomen  with  excellent  skills   and
knowledge. They would realise what  a  positive  contribution  our  men  and
women are making in our communities, such as the installation  of  peepholes
in the homes of the aged, or the raising  of  funds  for  NGOs  involved  in
skills development for job creation projects.

Our National Defence Force has been through a very tough time over the  past
seven or so years.  It  has  had  to  steer  a  very  difficult  integration
process. During the same  period  it  had  to  assist  in  emergency  relief
operations and embark on integration processes. Also during this period  the
Defence Force had to assist in emergency relief  operations,  peace  support
operations and assist the SAPS in crime prevention operations.

That they have done so without any complaints and with a limited  budget  is
a lesson in real patriotism. It  is  a  lesson  that  should  be  learnt  by
parties such as the DP and its members. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, I would like to indicate  that  the  UCDP  has
reservations about this budget and that that should be noted.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  We  will  note  your
reservation, hon member. It is not an objection.  It  is  your  reservation,
whatever that means.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party dissenting).
Vote No 22 - Independent Complaints Directorate  -  put  and  agreed  to  in
accordance with section 75 of the Constitution (United Christian  Democratic
Party dissenting).

Vote No 23 - Justice and Constitutional Development - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the DP  supports  this  Vote,  but  there  in  an
important concern that we need to place on record. This concern is that  for
the past three years this department has only received  a  qualified  report
from the Auditor-General. The DP has participated in  constructive  ways  to
try to rectify the situation or give ideas to  rectify  the  situation.  But
unless  the  financial  controls  of  this  department  show  some   serious
improvement, we will have to reassess our support  in  the  upcoming  budget
cycle.

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP steun  hierdie  begroting  van  die
Departement  van  Justisie  en  Staatkundige  Ontwikkeling,  sowel  as   die
begrotings ten opsigte van die ander departemente in ons strafregstelsel.

Die veiligheid en sekuriteit van die burgers van 'n land is  seker  een  van
die mees  fundamentele  en  hoogste  verantwoordelikhede  van  'n  regering.
Alhoewel die Regering in hierdie begroting  baie  meer  fondse  aan  hierdie
departement toegeken het, is daar steeds  groot  tekorte  aan  mannekrag  en
toerusting in hierdie en ander departemente in die strafreg-``cluster''  wat
ook, volgens die betrokke Ministers,  effektiewe  dienslewering,  en  daarom
die veiligheid en sekuriteit van ons burgers, negatief raak.

Ons glo dat selfs meer fondse aan hierdie departemente  een  van  die  beste
beleggings is wat hierdie Regering kan maak in die  toekoms  van  ons  land,
aangesien die dividende ten opsigte van 'n besparing  aan  al  die  miljarde
rande wat misdaad ons ekonomie kos, asook  die  groter  aantal  toeriste  en
meer direkte buitelandse investering wat ons sal kry, meer  as  sal  vergoed
daarvoor. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE:  Chairperson,  the  New  NP  supports  the  budget  of  the
Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,  as  well  as  the
budgets of the other departments within our criminal justice system.

The safety and security of the citizens of a country  is  certainly  one  of
the  most  fundamental  and  highest  responsibilities  of  any  government.
Although the Government has allocated far more funds in this budget to  this
department, there are still shortages with regard to manpower and  equipment
in this and other departments within the  criminal  justice  cluster,  which
also, according to the respective Ministers, impact negatively on  effective
service delivery and therefore detrimentally affect the safety and  security
of our citizens.

We believe that even more funds to these departments would  be  one  of  the
best investments that this Government could  make  in  the  future  of  this
country, since the dividends in respect of saving all the billions of  rands
that crime costs our economy, as well as the greater number of tourists  and
more direct foreign investment that would  come  our  way  would  more  than
compensate for that.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, on a point of order: The hon  member  is  talking
about the next Vote, the Safety and  Security  Vote,  not  the  Justice  and
Constitutional Development Vote, which we are on now.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): No, I thought  he  was
talking about justice.

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, miskien verstaan die agb lid nie  dat  justisie
ook te doen het met die strafregstelsel van hierdie  land  nie,  en  dat  as
justisie nie behoorlik funksioneer weens die tekort aan mannekrag  nie,  dit
ook misdaad beïnvloed. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daarom wil ek  net  graag  vir  die
Minister  van  Finansies  vra,  wanneer  die  Minister   vir   Justisie   en
Staatkundige Ontwikkeling en  ook  die  ander  Ministers  in  die  strafreg-
``cluster'' hom nader om ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, perhaps the hon  member  does  not  know  that
justice is part of the criminal justice system of this country, and that  if
justice does not function properly as a result of a  shortage  of  manpower,
then this also influences crime? [Interjections.] That is why I  would  like
to  ask  the  Minister  of  Finance,  when  the  Minister  for  Justice  and
Constitutional Development, as  well  as  the  other  Ministers  within  the
criminal justice cluster approach him to ...]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, on a point of  order:  I  am  rising  to  establish
which Vote it is that we  are  now  on.  Could  you  clarify  that,  please?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  The  Vote  we
are dealing with is Justice and Constitutional Development.

Ms C BOTHA: Thank you very much, Chairperson. I  hope  Mr  Matthee  is  also
aware of that.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): He  is  talking  about
the shortage of manpower - or personpower, or whatever you  call  it  -  and
the like. Would hon members please just sit and listen? We  are  spending  a
lot of time on useless points of order. Please continue, hon member.

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, die onkunde van die agb  lede  van  die  DP  is
ongelukkig baie groter as wat ek selfs gedink het.

Ek sluit af deur te sê dat ons dus die Minister van  Finansies  versoek  om,
wanneer die Minister vir Justisie en  Staatkundige  Ontwikkeling  hom  nader
vir meer fondse, tog simpatiek daarna te kyk,  aangesien  ons  glo  dat  die
dividende wat daaruit sal kom, baie meer as sal vergoed  vir  die  geld  wat
daaraan bestee word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, the ignorance of the hon members of the DP  is
unfortunately even greater than I thought.

I want to conclude by saying that we therefore ask the Minister of  Finance,
when the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development approaches  him
for more funds, please to  be  sympathetic  when  looking  at  it  since  we
believe that the dividends ensuing from it would more  than  compensate  for
the money spent on it.]

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 24 - Safety and Security - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, first of all may  I  say,  through  you  to  the
Minister, that we are most grateful  that  he  has  prioritised  Safety  and
Security, that we see an increase in expenditure and that 16 000 police  are
to be trained over the next three years. We think this is very good  and  we
are grateful.

I read in the paper today that,  interestingly  enough,  Scotland  Yard  are
seeking to recruit 5 000 policemen in South Africa because  they  are  short
of police. That is a compliment to our police, but I do hope  that  they  do
not succeed.

We object to this budget for a very simple  reason,  and  that  is  that  my
country, my province and my city - our city, in which we live - are  neither
safe nor secure. How can one vote for the budget of a  department  that  has
delivered so badly?

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, could the member take a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): No,  there  cannot  be
questions on the Votes.

Mr K D  S  DURR:  I  would  be  happy  to  take  a  question,  Mr  Chairman.
[Interjections.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I want to know if it is right for a  Christian
to mislead the House like that. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  No,  that  is  not  a
point of order. [Interjections.] Hon members, would you  allow  Mr  Durr  to
make his declaration?

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I wanted to know whether Mr Durr  would  like  to
be a bobby on the beat. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Mr  Durr,  would  you
finish your declaration?

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman,  in  our  city  a  few  days  ago,  five  petrol
attendants were assassinated, apparently so that someone  could  steal  R500
or R1 000. I understand that the robbery of petrol attendants is  a  routine
occurrence in Cape Town.

If one is a worker, one cannot get to one's place of  work  without  running
the gauntlet in the train - of gangsters, perhaps, or of  criminal  elements
of one kind or another. This is appalling.

Over the past year in our country, 900 farmers have been  attacked  and  140
of them killed - of all colours  and  cultures  and  in  all  parts  of  our
country. Cape Town is becoming the heist capital of South Africa,  and  this
form of crime - cash heists, that is - has increased this year by 300%.

These are alarming facts, and it is with regret,  because  I  have  a  great
respect and liking for  individual  policemen,  that  I  have  to  say  that
because our city and province are neither safe nor secure,  we  are  opposed
to this budget.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, the final score  is  Brazil  1,  Turkey  0.
[Interjections.]

The President made a call on all South  Africans  to  join  hands  and  went
further to urge us to  declare  war  against  crime.  The  Minister  made  a
similar call on politicians. If there were ever a time when we should  speak
with one voice, that time is now. Instead of opposing, let us bring  forward
proposals to the  departments  on  how  to  tackle  crime  in  our  country.
Political parties and politicians must be the ones who fight  on  behalf  of
these departments, so that they get more funding. This tendency of  opposing
for the sake of opposing must be discouraged.

Unfortunately the hon Durr has never  attended  a  single  meeting  of  this
committee. Let us desist from using crime  to  make  political  mileage,  if
there is any. Let us not behave like chained dogs that, even when  they  are
free, just move around the pole, not aware that they are free.

The ANC would  like  to  appeal  to  all  political  parties  to  put  their
political differences aside  and  join  hands  and  give  support  to  these
departments in their endeavour to fight crime. The  election  campaign  will
start in earnest some time  next  year,  not  now.  We  support  this  Vote.
[Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 25 - Agriculture - put and agreed to in accordance with  section  75
of the Constitution.

Vote No 26 - Communications - put.

Declaration of vote:

Prince  B  Z  ZULU:  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  colleagues,  ladies  and
gentlemen,  I  rise  on  behalf  of  the  ANC  in  support  of  Vote  26   -
Communications.   We  support  this  Vote  because  we  believe   that   the
allocation given by Parliament to the department will  enable  it  to  carry
out its functions and its objective of ensuring that communication  services
are available to the  people  of  South  Africa,  such  as  access  to  both
traditional and electronic media communications and information technology.

We believe that the provision  of  these  services  will  facilitate  higher
standards  of  living  and  accelerate  economic  growth  and   development.
Furthermore, this budget will put South Africa on the world map of  economic
success and, through its initiatives, will bridge  the  global  disparities.
Through ICT, the objectives of Nepad will be met.

In a nutshell, this budget will  enable  the  department  to  reinforce  the
development  of  the  telecommunications  infrastructure  in   underserviced
communities, in particular the rural areas; to give support  to  schools  in
procuring IT  equipment  and  accessing  the  Internet;  to  establish  more
telecentres  and  public  information  terminals;   to   provide   a   sound
environment for conducting business over the Internet; to  ensure  continued
access to mail  services;  and  to  upgrade  the  postal  infrastructure  in
historically disadvantaged areas.

It is also expected to make it possible for financial institutions  to  roll
out  banking  facilities  to  rural  areas.  Therefore,  as  the   ANC,   we
acknowledge the challenges in terms of our transformation programmes  placed
before this committee. We congratulate the department and support this  Vote
wholeheartedly. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 27 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, there are many  reasons  why  the  DP  cannot
support this Vote. I will mention only three. MCM  -  that  is,  Marine  and
Coastal Management -  spent  millions  of  rands  on  setting  up  a  rights
verification unit and a centre for anonymous tip-offs. Successes  have  been
minute, if any. For the last eight months the same example  has  been  used.
Expensive court cases are now the order of the day and there are  many  more
to come.

The second reason is this. Instead of giving the coastal communities of  the
West Coast the opportunity to benefit from the crayfish disaster in  January
and February this year, the state spent R129 597  on  replacing  or  dumping
mainly dead crayfish.

South Africa is hosting the World Summit on Sustainable Development. We  are
the first  country  outside  Europe  to  be  accredited  to  the  Blue  Flag
campaign, but one of our own Ramsar sites and a  world-renowned  windsurfing
area, Langebaan, is being ignored by this same Government, while  the  beach
is being eroded and washed away.

These are only three reasons why the DP cannot support this Vote.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, it was in this very Chamber that many laws  were
made against the majority of the people of  this  country.  [Interjections.]
Today the very people who were making laws against us in this  Chamber  want
to talk on behalf of our people who are impoverished. [Interjections.]  This
is not consistent. I think the DP has to make up its mind. If it carries  on
in this vein it will lose whatever support it has at  this  point  in  time,
because we are moving in a particular direction.

I rise on behalf of the ANC to support this Vote, Environmental Affairs  and
Tourism. We believe that this Vote is indeed conducive to the  wellbeing  of
all our people. It seeks to protect  our  environment  for  the  benefit  of
present and future generations  through  reasonable  legislative  and  other
measures, namely the prevention of  pollution  and  ecological  degradation,
the   promotion   of   conservation,   securing   ecologically   sustainable
development and the use of  natural  resources  while  ensuring  justifiable
economic and social development.

Moreover, we are confident that it will deliver a  successful  World  Summit
on Sustainable Development which aims to achieve a global agreement to  roll
back poverty in the developing world. In addition, it also  makes  provision
for the expansion of co-operation with all nine provinces.  As  the  ANC  we
appreciate this Vote's commitment to building on the present levels  of  our
country's position as a prime tourist destination. We  are  also  encouraged
by the achievements of the Minister and his department with  regard  to  the
transformation of fishing right allocations and the  department's  sustained
efforts to combat the high levels of crime affecting our marine resources.

Vote No 30 - Minerals and Energy - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I rise on behalf  of  the  ANC  to  support  this
particular Vote. The main reason we rise to support this Vote is  that  this
year, after eight years, this department has made this country  proud.  This
department has finally unlocked the economy for our people. This  department
has made the DP jealous with how many clever black people and geologists  it
has.

This department has proved to the detractors  of  transformation  that  this
particular ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I  see  a  hand
behind you. [Laughter.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, on a point of order: Could we ask  Mr  Moosa  to
hand in that speech he is reading from. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! That is  not  a
point of order. I thought that Ms Botha also had  her  hand  up.  Mr  Moosa,
complete your declaration.

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, the amazing thing about this particular  Vote  is
that today the Minister gave us a  clear  undertaking  that  the  department
would have, from top to bottom,  a  shipshape  administration,  to  set  the
wheels in motion for the people of this  country  to  take  control  of  the
natural resources of this country.

This department is a trail blazing department and has  started  the  process
to stop the plunder of minerals on the whole continent of  Africa.  A  start
is being made here. The companies that operate in the DRC, Angola and  other
parts of Africa should know that the Africans are coming  to  take  what  is
their own.

The ANC supports this budget. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Before  I
proceed, I want hon members to understand, with reference to those who  said
that they had reservations, that there is nothing like that  in  the  Rules.
One either objects or agrees. Therefore, while  a  member  could  have  said
that he or she had reservations, we will take it that he or she  objects  to
that Vote. It will be recorded as such.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 31 - Trade and Industry - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I have never made a secret of my admiration  for
the excellent work that this Minister has done over the past year, and if  I
may say so, the same goes for  our  chairman.  I  think  he  has  been  very
energetic and has led the committee very well. It is a problem for  me  that
the meetings are often at the same time the finance committee meets, but  we
have an excellent team and they have done very good work, for which  we  are
grateful.

We rise to object to this budget for a particular reason, and that  is  that
my party is directly  opposed  to  the  gambling  industry,  and  the  money
appearing on the budget expended by this department and  the  Government  on
the gambling industry. The ten chairmen and 274 officials who regulate  that
industry spend R127 million per annum, and we think the  public  is  getting
very poor value for its money. Not only do we  have  a  moral  objection  to
this, but we believe that gambling has been a  poor  investment,  costly  to
regulate, disappointing in its ability to raise taxes, high  in  the  social
ravages ...

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, I just want to know whether the hon member  will
take a question.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Not  on  Votes,  hon
member.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I will take it with pleasure  if  she  wants  me
to.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Can  you
continue?

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I can take that question ...
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! You are  eating
into your time, Mr Durr. On what is the hon member rising? Is that  a  point
of order?

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Yes, Chairperson. Is it in order for  a  member  to  have
his shirt hanging out? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am sure the hon member did  not
see that. Could the member finish, please! [Laughter.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I thank my colleague for his courtesy.

It is not only that we have a moral objection, but we believe that  gambling
has been a  poor  investment,  costly  to  regulate,  disappointing  in  its
ability to raise taxes, high in the social ravages that it inflicts  on  our
society  and  creating  a  climate  that   fosters   crime,   drug   taking,
prostitution, money laundering and gangsterism.

Indeed, the indirect social costs to Government and  society  are  huge  and
negate any apparent benefits.  Gambling  undermines  family  life,  savings,
frugality and hard work, and it contributes to a  worse  life  for  all.  We
appeal to the Minister on this: Let us  stop  issuing  gambling  and  casino
licences and begin to roll back this industry, which  is  a  cancer  in  our
society.

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, the ANC supports this Vote precisely  because  we
believe that the department will be able to  carry  out  its  functions  and
objectives.   Secondly,   we   believe   that   through   the   Government's
macroeconomic reform strategy, the department will be  able  to  remove  the
impediments to growth, employment and equity, and  sustain  high  levels  of
growth and development.

We acknowledge that since 1994 the department has  been  able  to  turn  our
economy around. Whereas in 1994 it was on the verge of collapse,  today  our
economy is more stable and prospects of growth are high.  We  are  convinced
that this budget will help the department to lead and facilitate  access  to
sustainable economic activity and employment for all South Africans  through
higher levels of investment and increased access  to  international  markets
for South African products.
We  believe  that  it  will  create  a  fair,  competitive   and   efficient
marketplace for domestic and foreign enterprises, as well as for  consumers,
and increase competitiveness  and  equity  in  the  context  of  the  global
economy. Khula Enterprises, since its inception,  has  generated  more  than
one million jobs. Two thirds of these went to  black-owned  enterprises  and
almost 40% went to women-only enterprises. Through the work of the  MECs  28
000 jobs were created and 536 small businesses in the  manufacturing  sector
have been assisted. Ntsika has supported more than  80  000  SMMEs  and  has
trained over 100 000 entrepreneurs.

The ANC believes that the history of this department speaks for  itself  and
that is why all of us must support this budget.  There  is  nothing  in  the
budget about the building of new casinos and so  forth,  and  we  hope  that
members of the ACDP will not mislead  our  communities  and  our  people  by
stating things that are not in the budget.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 32 - Transport - put.

Declaration of vote:

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, the ANC supports this Vote.  It  is  a  pity
that now we see an immature new alliance of the DP and the ACDP inside  this
House. We do not talk to impress the media or this House,  but  we  talk  on
behalf of the masses that we represent.

We agree that there are serious challenges that are  facing  the  Department
of  Transport.  Road  and  rail  infrastructure  require   serious   capital
investment, above current levels. However, some important progress has  been
made in this regard,  especially  with  maintenance  of  the  national  road
network, and we agree that there are serious challenges in respect of  rural
and provincial roads.

With regard to taxi recapitalisation, we had hoped that it would  be  rolled
out in 2006. Nevertheless, important progress has been made  in  respect  of
legislation,  formalisation  and  democratisation  with  the  existence   of
Santaco. We expect an announcement before the end of this year.

As far as community rail safety is  concerned,  Cabinet  has  announced  the
intention to set up railway and transit police, and  the  ANC  expects  that
this will be implemented as soon as possible.

Just one message to the ACDP: they seem  to  be  jacks  of  all  trades  and
masters of none. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party dissenting).

Schedule agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

     (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Finance
                                  thereon)
The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and hon members, I move. [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I hope  I  will  be  forgiven  for  my  hoarse
voice; I have flu. Chairperson, Minister, Deputy Minister,  members  of  the
NCOP and special delegates present here today,  I  am  going  to  disappoint
people. I am not going to say, ``I so move''. I just want to  reflect  on  a
few things that I think are important to be noted when we  are  passing  the
Appropriation Bill.

Parliament is once  again  asked  to  approve  the  Appropriation  from  the
National Revenue Fund for the purposes of  meeting  the  objectives  of  the
state for the financial year 2002-03. This is in compliance with the  Public
Finance Management Act which was passed in 1999.

What is worth noting is that the quality of work and  information  contained
in the Budget documents, both in the Budget Review and in the  estimates  of
national expenditure, have improved beyond anyone's  expectations,  and  the
Treasury and the Ministry  in  particular  have  to  be  commended  on  this
aspect. The estimates of national  expenditure  content  will  be  a  living
example in this instance,  and,  secondly,  for  the  first  time,  I  think
members of Parliament have seen  the  tabling  of  the  strategic  plans  by
national departments and the parastatals that  operate  at  national  level.
Those strategic plans are for the next three years,  up  to  2005.  I  think
this is an important development for members, because it means that  members
of Parliament will be able to hold their respective departments to  account,
and those departments or parastatals will  be  able  to  assist  members  in
executing their oversight role with the information which  is  contained  in
these documents, over and above  what  is  reflected  in  the  estimates  of
national expenditure.

Secondly, during the Vote debates members and  some  Ministers  spoke  about
the fact that some of the resources allocated to their departments were  not
sufficient. In view of the above  statement  I  would  like  to  invite  all
members of Parliament, whether from the National Assembly  or  the  National
Council  of  Provinces,  to  reflect  upon  the  need  for  the  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework.

I think Minister Ngubane said that this was a very important  planning  tool
which allowed priorities to be adjusted from time to time, as and  when  the
need arose. I think this is an important element, that  members  must  begin
to use the MTEF in order to raise issues  and  priorities  that  they  think
must be reflected in those departmental priorities.  It  is  also  important
that members should engage with the respective departments in ensuring  that
actual expenditure trends contained in the strategic planning for  the  next
three years do reflect priorities in terms  of  expenditure  levels.  It  is
important to highlight that some departments and provinces continue  not  to
spend all resources allocated to them.

I again call upon members as policy makers to make sure that we do not  come
back next year and complain that people need more money, without looking  at
what people have done with the money and holding them responsible by  asking
questions  or  raising  motions.  I  think  it  is  also  important  to  use
information  that  will  be  presented  from  time  to  time,  as  per   the
requirements of the PFMA, the quality reports and the  monthly  reports.  So
members should be able to assist the departments which  are  struggling,  as
these reports are released as part of the early-warning system.

It is important to highlight that South Africa is a developing  country  and
therefore resources are not in abundance. There are limited  resources  that
people are competing for. It  is  therefore  important  that  prioritisation
should take place from time to time and in this regard some  departments  in
one particular financial year will experience a decrease while  others  will
experience an increase. I think this is in line with the  prioritisation  by
Government from time to time and this is a necessary point  that  should  be
made.

The last point I want to make is that South Africa and its leadership,  from
Cabinet to local government level, should be commended because our  policies
and budgets are our own creation. No one has come from the IMF or the  World
Bank to impose structural adjustment on us. This is a development  which  we
must cherish and be able to value, because the leadership, the Cabinet,  the
Minister of Finance and his colleagues, have taken those hard  decisions  in
order for us as a country to be where we are today. We must try not to  move
to a stage where we do not live like other countries, where  half  of  their
budget is from donors and the donors dictate to  those  countries  what  the
moneys should be used for. For  that  fact  I  would  like  to  commend  the
leadership of the national Treasury and  all  the  officials  with  whom  we
interact from time to time.

I call on all members to support the Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Siyabulela kakhulu! [Thank you very much!]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                        TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

     (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Finance
                                  thereon)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Mnr die  Voorsitter,  agb  lede,  ek  stel  hierdie
konsepwetgewing met plesier voor. [Applous.] [Mr Chairperson,  hon  members,
it gives me pleasure to move this draft legislation.  [Applause.]]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, Minister, Deputy  Minister  and  members,  the
Taxation Laws Amendment Bill before this House today  seeks  to  effect  the
tax policy proposal put by the Minister when he tabled his Budget Speech  on
20 February 2002.

I just want to highlight a few things,  which  I  think  members  should  be
quite aware of by now, but I think it is important for the purpose  of  this
debate to touch on them.

First of all, during the committee hearings and even when we  met  today  to
discuss the Bill, people raised the fact that in  terms  of  this  Bill  the
Commissioner seeks more powers. At the time it was stated  that  this  might
lead to corruption and many other things which might not  be  desirable  for
the kind of democracy we are building.

In my view, however, after thorough consideration, I believe what  has  been
drafted in the Bill is quite adequate and responds to  the  reality  of  the
day-to-day functions of the Commissioner. Also, these powers are  not  open-
ended. From time to time the Minister will be able  to  publish  regulations
in the Gazette to regulate the powers of the Commissioner. I  do  not  think
the Commissioner will not be required to  report,  so  there  will  also  be
reporting requirements which will be necessary.

Secondly, I want to highlight the weight incentives  which  were  introduced
by Government. The Bill speaks of the learnership  programme.  I  think  the
learnership programme should not be viewed in isolation of the  Government's
human resource development strategy, which seeks to build the skills  levels
in the country. This Bill proposes that companies should  be  encouraged  to
employ learners who are out of school in order to work and  gain  skills  at
the same time. In turn, companies will be able to get tax  deductions.  This
is quite an important development, because not only do companies  receive  a
tax benefit, but the country as a whole benefits, in  line  with  the  human
resource development strategy.

Thirdly, I want to highlight that some of the transfer  duties  for  certain
amounts will be eliminated. For instance, if a person wants to buy  a  house
of R70 000, he or she will have to pay about 1% in transfer  duties.  In  my
view and  in  the  view  of  the  ANC  this  is  an  important  development,
particularly for black people who were not able to acquire their  own  fixed
property or housing because of the difficulty that  they  were  required  to
pay these transfer duties.

With regard to buying a house of R100  000  or  more,  people  will  not  be
required to pay any transfer duties for the first R100 000. They  only  have
to pay transfer duties for the amount above R100 000. In my view  these  are
very important developments to people who did not  own  houses  before.  But
even those who owned houses before will be able to  use  this  tax  benefit.
This is a result of the efficiency of our tax collection and the  management
of the SA Revenue Service.

The last issue I want to highlight is clause 27 of the  Bill,  which  refers
to businesspeople who have been found by the  SA  Revenue  Service  to  have
resources abroad. By law people have to pay  tax  in  South  Africa  on  the
interest they receive from resources abroad. This development  is  important
in my view, because it will not only deal with people who have  taken  money
out of the country illegally, but with a number of other  factors  and  will
further increase the  revenue  that  the  SA  Revenue  Service  is  able  to
generate.

These are just a few issues, but there are many other  things  that  we  can
talk about. However, in the interests of time, I shall sit down. I  call  on
members to support the Bill. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, hon Minister of Finance, hon Deputy Minister  of
Finance and colleagues, as I mentioned in my address  to  this  House  at  a
similar occasion last year, once in a while it becomes necessary to  tie  up
neatly  a  collection  of  amendments  to  a  variety  of  Acts,  and   more
specifically so when these refer to tax matters.

The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill is of a technical nature  and  consists  of
no fewer than 84  clauses,  each  dealing  with  a  different  and  specific
amendment.  The  amendments  are  broadly  categorised  into   those   which
encompass tax relief measures as  far  as  direct  and  indirect  taxes  are
concerned,   and   those   which   include   anti-avoidance   measures   and
simplifications concerning direct  taxes  and  indirect  tax  measures.  The
topics covered range from customs  and  excise,  stamp  duties,  value-added
tax, transfer duty and income tax, to matters  such  as  skills  development
levies, marketable securities tax and unemployment insurance contributions.

Under the income tax grouping, the following are but a few  of  the  diverse
range of subjects which are, inter  alia,  dealt  with  in  this  Bill:  The
introduction of a single rate of tax  for  trusts  to  address  the  current
practice of income splitting through the use of multiple  trust  structures;
the  introduction  of  an   accelerated   depreciation   for   manufacturing
investment, allowing the taxpayer to deduct 40% of the cost of the asset  in
the year during which that asset is brought into use  for  the  first  time;
the provision for the deduction in respect of certain  plant  and  machinery
of small business corporations  which  comply  with  certain  criteria;  the
provision  that  specific  rules   apply   to   transactions   relating   to
liquidation,  winding-up  and  deregistration  of  a  liquidating   company;
provision for the deduction of donations  made  to  certain  public  benefit
organisations;  and  the  exemption  from  income  tax  of  public   benefit
organisations which carry on certain public benefit activities.

An interesting observation as far as the  latter  is  concerned,  and  which
should be of particular interest to political parties  represented  in  this
House, is  that  ``in  order  to  underpin  transparency  in  the  political
process'' subclause (j) of clause 22 prohibits public benefit  organisations
from using any resources to support, advance or oppose any political party.

One subject which I have already briefly referred to and  which  is  a  very
important concession, in view of the fact that  small  business  development
is  a  key  element  of  Government's  strategy  for  economic  growth   and
employment creation, is the provision for a deduction in respect of  certain
plant and machinery of small business enterprises which comply with  certain
criteria.
These enterprises were subject to a graduated tax rate of 15% on  the  first
R100 000 of taxable income, writing off investment expenditure in  the  year
in which it was incurred. The amendment in this case raises  the  15%  level
to R150 000 and increases the turnover limit from R1 million to  R3  million
to ensure that more small businesses enjoy these benefits.

As I mentioned right  at  the  beginning  of  my  address  and  taking  into
consideration the wide scope of amendments covered, it was necessary to  tie
these up in one Bill, a job neatly and expertly executed by the  experts  of
the SA Revenue Service and the National Treasury. The New  NP  supports  the
Bill. [Applause.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill is  amending  a
lot of legislation to incorporate taxation proposals flowing from  both  the
Budget for 2001 and the Budget for 2002.

The primary proposals in the Bill deal with the tax relief announced by  the
Minister of Finance in the 2002 Budget. However, there are also a number  of
additional proposals in this Bill, including the finalisation  of  the  tax-
exempt status of public benefit organisations and the introduction of a  9th
schedule that categorises public benefit organisations.

The employment incentive  announced  in  the  2001  Budget  is  given  legal
content. This is to encourage learnership,  and  we  strongly  support  this
initiative. Proposals around the streamlining  of  customs  and  excise  are
also incorporated in this Bill.

Hierdie wetsontwerp sluit ook die volgende element in wat belangrik vir  die
belastingbetaler mag wees, naamlik nuwe dispuutbeslegtingsmagte wat aan  die
kommissaris toegeken word. Ons vertrou dat hierdie magte  met  groot  oorleg
aangewend  sal  word,  en  dat  dispuutbeslegtiging  en/of  arbitrasie  meer
vaartbelyn sal geskied.

Die Minister van Finansies moet regulasies uitvaardig om  hierdie  magte  te
reël. Dit gaan veral oor die verslagdoening oor die uitoefening van  hierdie
magte. Die Gesamentlike Staande Komitee  op  Finansies  behoort  na  hierdie
regulasies te kyk as deel van die toesighoudingsrol  wat  die  komitee  moet
vervul. Die wetsontwerp, in  ooreenstemming  met  voorstelle  in  die  2002-
begroting,  doen  weg  met  belastingaftrekbare  toelaes.  Dit  is  om   die
belastingstelsel te  vereenvoudig  en  groter  onderskeid  te  bring  tussen
maatskappy- en persoonlike belasting.

Omdat die wetsontwerp  hoofsaaklik  te  doen  het  met  belastingtoegewings,
werkverskaffingsinisiatiewe en 'n totale nuwe belastingstelsel vir  openbare
weldaadorganisasies,  steun  die  DP  die   wetsontwerp.   (Translation   of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This Bill also includes the following elements that  may  be  important  to
the taxpayer,  namely  new  dispute  settling  powers  being  given  to  the
commissioner. We trust that  these  powers  will  be  exercised  with  great
caution, and that the settling of  disputes  and/or  arbitration  will  take
place in a more streamlined manner.

The Minister of Finance must issue regulations  to  regulate  these  powers.
This concerns in particular feedback on the exercising of these powers.  The
Joint Standing Committee on Finance  should  examine  these  regulations  as
part of the oversight function that the committee has to fulfil.  The  Bill,
in accordance with the proposals in the 2002  Budget,  does  away  with  tax
deductible allowances.  This  is  being  done  to  simplify  the  system  of
taxation and make a greater distinction between corporate tax  and  personal
tax.

Because  the  Bill  deals  primarily  with  tax  concessions,  job  creation
initiatives  and  a  completely  new   tax   system   for   public   welfare
organisations, the DP supports the Bill.]

We again want to congratulate the National Treasury and  Sars  on  the  work
they are doing  and  we  wish  them  well  in  the  implementation  of  this
legislation for the betterment of the whole of South Africa. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The hon M J Makoela is the next speaker.

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, it is M I Makoela. The big question is: Why  do
we have to have taxes? And the simple answer is that until someone comes  up
with a better idea, taxation is the only practical means of raising  revenue
to finance Government spending on the goods and services  that  most  of  us
demand.

Setting up an efficient and fair tax system is, however,  far  from  simple,
particularly for economies in transition such as South  Africa's  that  want
to become integrated in the international economy. Therefore, the ideal  tax
system  should  raise  essential  revenue   without   excessive   government
borrowing, and should do  so  without  discouraging  economic  activity  and
without deviating too much from tax systems elsewhere. Moreover, tax  policy
is often the art of the possible, rather than the pursuit of the optimal.

The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill  of  2002  guides  us  in  this  direction.
Unlike individuals whose income determines their spending, Government  first
determines what expenditure it will incur and then  decides  how  to  obtain
the  necessary  funds.  Hence,  every  year  on  Budget  day  the   national
Government  tables  its  tax  proposals  to  meet  its  expenditure   needs.
Therefore, as members of the NCOP we have gathered once again to debate  the
Taxation Laws Amendment Bill for the financial year commencing  on  1  April
2002.
Every year members of this House debate to amend, amongst other things,  the
Income Tax Act of 1962, which is one of the objectives of the Taxation  Laws
Amendment Bill of 2002. The government of any state needs funds  to  provide
certain services, which  individual  citizens  are  unable  to  provide  for
themselves, such as the maintenance of internal security, the protection  of
the integrity of  the  borders  of  the  state,  the  provision  of  welfare
services, etc.

Members of this House will be keen  to  learn  that  income  tax  was  first
adopted in Great Britain in 1798. In the USA, income tax  and  death  duties
were effectively applied for the first time during the First World  War.  In
South Africa, the Income Tax Act was first promulgated in  1914.  Currently,
the Income Tax Act of  1962  contains  112  sections  and  eight  schedules,
making up about 250  pages.  The  Taxation  Laws  Amendment  Bill  currently
before this House introduces an additional schedule -  the  ninth  schedule.
This schedule unambiguously defines public benefit activities.

The range of institutions that could  receive  tax-deductible  donations  is
broadened, and Government has released a list of public  benefit  activities
in which an organisation must be involved  in  order  to  obtain  tax-exempt
status. The list of public-sector activities is not static and  will  evolve
to reflect the needs and realities of the nonprofit sector  and  to  conform
to the national Government social and welfare enhancement strategy.

I would like to deviate a bit by drawing the attention of the Minister  away
from the Chief Whip to the following remark I heard  the  other  day  by  an
ordinary taxpayer, who said: ``I believe we should all pay our  tax  with  a
smile. I tried, but they wanted cash.''

While  it  is  often  alleged  that   globalisation   could   restrict   our
Government's freedom to design tax and transfer  programmes,  we  have  done
much to effect income distribution, improve the distribution of  opportunity
and access to education and health  services,  and  institute  well-targeted
social safety nets.

Some of my colleagues have mentioned some of the benefits of this Bill,  and
I would like to go on by mentioning that it is consistent  with  our  equity
objectives. It should be noted that equity should not be viewed narrowly  as
an  issue  of  equitable  distribution  of  income  only.  Equity  has  many
dimensions. Therefore, neither a single indicator nor a  single  best-policy
prescription can address the multitude of equity concerns.

Economic and tax policy should be mindful of nonincome  aspects  of  equity,
such as educational achievements, health care and nutritional  status.  With
those few words, we support the Bill. [Applause.]

The  MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  How  long  should  I  speak  for,  Chairperson?
[Interjections.]  Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  members  who
contributed to this debate.

There is perhaps just one point I would like to clarify,  and  that  relates
to  a  point  made  by  two  members  in  respect  of  the  powers  of   the
commissioner. I  think  that  members  here  would  appreciate  that  it  is
important that the SA Revenue Service  should  be  able  to  operate  in  an
unimpeded way, or impeded only by the framework of the Constitution and  the
statute.

By virtue of its entire construction, the executive does  not  interfere  in
the work of the SA Revenue Service. Therefore, there is  a  tradition  of  a
fair amount of discretion vested in  the  commissioner.  Understanding  this
issue is a precursor to dealing with the amendments  in  the  Taxation  Laws
Amendment Bill before this House.

What is important, though, is  that  the  commissioner  should  be  held  to
account. Part of that accountability has  to  be  in  the  form  of  regular
reports to Parliament. In terms of  the  nature  of  those  reports,  it  is
important to recognise that the details of any individual taxpayer would  be
outside of the purview of Parliament, but the question  as  to  whether  the
commissioner has operated  within  the  framework  and  the  spirit  of  the
legislation is the one that needs to be answered on an ongoing basis.

Having said that, it  is  also  important  to  recognise  that  as  per  the
commitments  made  in  the  Budget  this  year,  we  have   established   an
independent office to ensure that taxpayers know that their matters will  be
taken up. For the moment this is in the  office  of  the  commissioner,  but
going forward there might be an ombudsman moved outside  of  the  office  of
the commissioner, so that taxpayers have the assurance  that  their  matters
are being dealt with earnestly and speedily.

Also, all taxpayers have recourse to the courts, especially to  the  special
income tax courts. There is a very special provision, and it  is  that  once
an assessment is issued by the Revenue Service, taxpayers have  30  days  to
object. If the objection is  not  heard,  taxpayers  have  recourse  to  the
special income tax courts.

We must try to speed up  the  administration.  It  is  important  for  base-
broadening that we minimise the interference, minimise the bureaucracy  and,
at the same time, give all taxpayers in  this  country  the  assurance  that
their matters are being dealt with earnestly, with diligence  and  with  all
the protection that the income tax system provides for the secrecy of  their
matters of taxation.

I would like to express appreciation for the support  from  all  parties  in
this House. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                    HEALTH DONATIONS FUND ACT REPEAL BILL

 (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Social Services
                                  thereon)

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, hon members, the Health Donations Fund  Act  Repeal
Bill seeks to provide for the disestablishment of the Health Donations  Fund
and for the repeal of the Health Donations Fund Act of 1978.

The Health Donations Fund was established by section 2 of the  Act  in  1978
to receive and manage donations from the private sector  to  the  Department
of Health. Only three small donations were made to the fund in the  past  24
years: one in June 1978 of R583; one in August 1979  of  R432;  and  one  in
1980 of R50.

The annual audit of the fund is costly, and for  that  reason  the  Standing
Committee on Public Accounts advised  the  department  to  disestablish  the
fund. [Interjections.] I would like to ask the Chairperson or the House  for
protection because the hon member said that I must speak softly.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon  member  is  protected.  Carry
on.

Mr F ADAMS: Thank you,  Chairperson.  The  Bill  makes  provision  that  the
unexpended balance of the money standing to the credit of the  fund  at  the
date of the disestablishment accrues to the National Revenue Fund. The  Bill
also states clearly that any liability of the fund which has  not  been  met
at the date of the disestablishment devolves to the state.

The disestablishment of the fund does not mean  that  no  further  donations
can be made to the department. Other mechanisms are still in  place  through
which  donations  can  be  made  to  the  Department  of  Health.  The  only
difference will be that the state will no longer incur  any  costs  relating
to the auditing of the fund when the Bill becomes law.

The Select Committee on Social Services considered  the  Bill  and  requests
the House to approve it. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
 AFFAIRS - PROTOCOL ON ESTABLISHMENT OF AFRICAN COURT ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES'
                                   RIGHTS

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, although the select committee would have  liked
to consult widely on this, we unfortunately did not have  that  opportunity,
although we understand that the portfolio  committee  has  consulted  widely
and has even obtained a legal opinion in this  regard.  We  therefore,  very
briefly, wish to explain to the House what this is all about.

In terms of our Constitution, our Constitutional Court is  and  remains  the
highest court in the country in respect of all  constitutional  matters.  In
terms of article 50 of the African Charter on  Human  and  Peoples'  Rights,
the African Commission can only deal with matters  submitted  to  it,  after
making sure that all local remedies, if they  exist,  have  been  exhausted,
unless it is obvious to  the  African  commission  that  the  procedure  for
achieving these remedies would be unduly prolonged. The jurisdiction of  the
African Court, when established in terms  of  article  1  of  the  protocol,
shall in terms of the protocol extend to all cases  and  disputes  submitted
to it concerning the interpretation and application of the African  Charter,
the protocol, and any other relevant human rights  instruments  ratified  by
the states concerned.

In terms of article 2 of the protocol, the African Court shall,  bearing  in
mind the provisions  thereof,  complement  the  protective  mandate  of  the
African Commission conferred  upon  it  by  the  African  Charter.  It  will
result, therefore, in a complementary system of protection of human  rights,
one in terms of our Constitution, and the other  in  terms  of  the  African
Charter.  Only  the  African   Commission,   state   parties   and   African
intergovernmental organisations have direct access  to  the  African  Court.
Access to the African Court may  be  extended  to  relevant  nongovernmental
organisations and individuals in certain respects. The two  systems  that  I
have referred to will largely be complementary and mutually  reinforcing  of
each other.

From a literal reading of articles 28(2) and 30  of  the  protocol,  and  in
comparison with section 167(3) of our Constitution, it  has  been  suggested
that there might be a potential conflict. However, the possibility  of  such
a conflict actually arising is remote within such a complementary system  of
protection of human rights. In terms of section 231(4) of the  Constitution,
international agreements only become law in the Republic when they  are  not
actually enacted by national legislation.

We as a committee recommend that the Council, in terms of section 231(2)  of
the Constitution, approve the said protocol.  However,  as  a  committee  we
have also resolved that if the executive at any stage  makes  a  declaration
in terms of article 34(6) of the protocol, accepting the competence  of  the
court to receive cases in terms of article 5(3), such  a  declaration  shall
first be tabled in Parliament for approval, in other words  if  they  should
open it and make it accessible to NGOs and individuals.

We as a committee also recommend to the executive,  where  at  all  possible
and practicable, to consult and interact with  both  Houses  of  Parliament,
through their relevant  committees,  before  the  signing  of  international
protocols like this one, so that the legitimate concerns  which  members  of
Parliament,  as  the  duly  elected  representatives  of  our   people   and
provinces, may have  can  be  dealt  with  and  addressed  at  the  earliest
possible opportunity. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

                               POINT OF ORDER

                                  (Ruling)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I would like  to  make  a
ruling on the objection that was raised by the hon member  Ms  Botha  during
the policy debate on Environmental Affairs and Tourism  in  respect  of  the
statement made by the  hon  member  Mr  Windvoël.  After  listening  to  the
Hansard records, I satisfied myself that the statement, in  the  context  in
which it had been made, was unparliamentary. I  therefore  request  the  hon
member to withdraw the statement.

Mr V V W WINDVOëL: I withdraw it.

The Council adjourned at 18:07.

     SCHEDULE II


         1. On  page  53,  in  the  second  line  of  item  12(1),  to  omit
              "Schedule" and to substitute "Act".


         2. On page 53, in item 12(4), to omit "within five years  from  the
              date of commencement of this Act" and to  substitute  "in  the
              prescribed manner".


     The Committee further reports as follows:


     A.     Committee Process


         The Bill was introduced in the National Assembly on 19 April  2002.
         The Committee and the Portfolio Committee on  Minerals  and  Energy
         of  the  National  Assembly  (the  Portfolio  Committee)   received
         extensive briefings on the Bill from  the  Department  of  Minerals
         and Energy, both before and after its introduction in the  National
         Assembly.


         The  Committee,  jointly  with  the   Portfolio   Committee,   then
         proceeded to advertise for public comment  on  the  bill.  A  large
         number  of  submissions  were  received  (a  list  of   submissions
         received is attached as addendum A).  Based  on  these  submissions
         the Committee requested certain organisations  and  individuals  to
         present oral evidence before it during the public hearings  on  the
         Bill. The public hearings were held at  Parliament  from  4  to  11
         June.


         The Committee, jointly with the Portfolio Committee, commenced  its
         deliberations on the Bill on 12 June  and  has  worked  long  hours
         together with the Department and the State Law  Advisers  in  order
         to process the Bill. During these deliberations it  became  evident
         that due to the extensive nature of the amendments being  envisaged
         it would be feasible to present to Parliament a redrafted bill.


         In  addition  the  Committees  also  conducted  provincial   public
         hearings from 8 to 9 June. Reports on  these  public  hearings  are
         detailed below.


     B.     Provincial Public Hearings


         1. Northern Cape, Springbok


              Mr M Moosa from the NCOP and Prof I Mohamed and Ms  E  Ngaleka
              of  the  National  Assembly,  accompanied  by  Ms  F  Sotenjwa
              (Committee  Secretary),  attended  the  public   hearings   in
              Springbok. The following organisations were in attendance:


              *   Nama Khoi District Municipality
              *   Pula Transformation Committee
              *   Namakhoi Ward Committee
              *   Richtersveld Municipality
              *   Richtersveld Transformation Committee
              *   Nama Khoi Diamond Fund Trust
              *   Richtersveld CPA
              *   Alexkor
              *   Swanson Enterprise
              *   Nama Khoi Klein Myn
              *   Groenhoekies Myn
              * Black Mountain
              *   Trans Hex Group
              *   SAPD
              *   Provincial Department of Minerals and Energy


              The delegation also received  a  written  submission  from  Mr
              Niewoudt from the Pula Transformation Committee.


              Mr B van Wyk explained the background  of  the  Bill  and  its
              objectives.  The  three  delegates  from  Parliament  gave   a
              detailed briefing of  the  Bill  (clause  by  clause)  to  the
              audience.  They  also  explained  extensively  the  difference
              between prospecting rights, mining rights and mining  permits,
              which seemed not to  be  clear  to  the  communities.  It  was
              explained that the Bill intends to bring  the  small  and  big
              companies to work together, as well  as  how  this  should  be
              done.


              The following concerns from the communities of the region were
              noted:


              (a) General concern from municipalities


                  The key concern from representatives of municipalities  of
                  the region was the benefit  of  municipalities  from  this
                  law. The small miners indicated that the  Bill  lacks  the
                  financial provision for  the  government  to  support  the
                  small miners to run their mines. Also,  the  State  should
                  indicate  the  criteria  it  will  use  to   differentiate
                  between the small and the big mine. It was noted that  the
                  small miners were concerned about whether  the  government
                  would make suggestions when small  and  big  miners  enter
                  into  joint  ventures  contracts,  and   about   how   the
                  government would monitor corruption  in  those  contracts.
                  The  communities  felt  that   workers   should   be   the
                  shareholders in companies. The  government  should  assist
                  the communities  of  Namaqualand  to  add  value  to  many
                  different minerals available in the region.


              (b) Clause 21 - application for renewal of mining right


                  The concern from small miners  was,  if  the  first  miner
                  mines and rehabilitates and the second miner  applies  for
                  the mining right for the  same  mine,  whether  the  State
                  would  consider  granting  the  permit   to   the   second
                  applicant.


              (c) Clause 24 -  application  for,  issuing  and  duration  of
                  mining permit


                  The communities felt  that  the  two-year  period  of  the
                  mining permit that the Bill makes provision  for,  is  too
                  short. Due to funding problems the small miners would  not
                  have prospered enough within two years.


                  The  community  of  Namaqualand  showed  an  interest   to
                  support the Bill.


         2. Limpopo Province, Mankweng


              Public  hearings  scheduled  to  take  place  in  Mankweng  on
              Saturday, 8 June 2002, did not materialise. It was found  that
              communication   between   Parliament   and   the    Provincial
              Legislature and between the Legislature and stakeholders  were
              poor. Traditional leaders and leaders of  civil  society  were
              not consulted. In addition, there was  no  feedback  from  the
              stakeholders  as  to  whether  they  would  be  attending  the
              hearings  or  not,  and  publicity  in  the  media   was   not
              sufficient.
              The delegation was deeply concerned by non-attendance  of  the
              Provincial Legislature's committee members, though the  matter
              was communicated to the  provincial  chairperson  and  to  the
              provincial Speaker. Provinces should note that  although  this
              piece of legislation is classified as a national competence in
              terms of section 75  of  the  Constitution,  the  implications
              still have a direct bearing on provinces.


              The delegation also noted that conducting public hearings on a
              week-end is problematic for a number of reasons. It  was  also
              clear to the delegation that  Mankweng  was  not  a  strategic
              place for hearings.


              The delegation recommended that the hearings for  the  Limpopo
              Province  be  rescheduled  for  a  later  date  and  that  the
              Legislature should identify two or three venues at a  time  or
              Pietersburg. Furthermore, the day for  hearings  should  be  a
              normal working day. The Regional Office of the  Department  of
              Minerals and Energy should also be engaged more effectively in
              administrative and support areas.  The  House  of  Traditional
              leaders in the province should also be directly consulted.


         3. North West and Free State


              The delegation consisted of Mr M Goniwe  (Chairperson),  Mr  J
              Nash, Mr S K Louw, Ms N Cindi, Ms B Tinto, Mrs M  M  Ramakaba-
              Leseia and Mr S Mongwaketse of the National Assembly and Mr  Z
              Kolweni of the National Council of Provinces.  The  delegation
              was accompanied by Ms N Hlasa (Committee Secretary).


              Public hearings in North West were held on 8 June and  in  the
              Free State on 9 June 2002. These hearings were advertised both
              nationally  and  locally  in  newspapers  and  on  radio.   In
              addition, an invitation was also extended  to  the  provincial
              governments as well as to the  relevant  provincial  portfolio
              committees, to attend the hearings and to give their views  on
              the Bill, if they deemed it necessary.


              The following  persons  made  oral  presentations  during  the
              public hearings:

              *   Matjhabeng Municipality


              The Committee also received the following written submissions:


              *   Manyedi Diamond Mining & Associates cc
              *   Simon Maroga


              The organisations and members of the public who  were  at  the
              public hearing recommended as follows:


              *   The Bill should also include a  timeframe  of  issuing  of
                licences


              *   Protect the rights of women in the mining business


              *   Educational capacity-building


              *   Health and safety of workers


              *   "Retrenchment Policy" - the number be reduced from 500  to
                maximum 200


              *   More clarity required on "Joint Venture", (Clear mechanism
                on how it should work and how people will be protected)


              *   "Social Plan" - a notice of at least  24  months  must  be
                given to implement the social plan. This requirement must be
                in the terms of reference


              *   Geological Report" should be made available before signing
                contracts


              *   Ownership" - are people not going to loose their lands?
              *   The bill must include more environmental issues


              *   Contractors should be monitored in terms of LRA and BCE


              *   Risk  Management  Programmes  be  developed  and  properly
                implemented


              With regard to definitions:


              *   "Employee" should be the same as  the  definition  in  the
                Mining Act


              *   "Historically disadvantaged" should  specifically  mention
                women


              *   "Development" - the host towns  should  be  developing  as
                part of Social Plan


              *   "Mining area" should be clearly defined in the bill


              The following concerns were also raised with the delegation:


              *   They received invitations to the public hearing very  late
                and as a result they did not have enough time to go  through
                the Bill


              *   The approach to the  hearing  in  future  should  be  that
                participants be grouped  into  three  different  categories:
                individuals, community and co-operations


              *   After the government has  taken  ownership,  it  must  not
                privatise the mining industry


              *   The security fee is too high


              Apart  from  all  the  recommendations  and  concerns  raised,
              organisations and members of the public were very  happy  that
              at long last the government is going to take  control  of  all
              resources of this country and therefore  the  wealth  will  be
              distributed equitably.


     C.     Majority Party view


         The ANC fully supports the Bill, in the belief that  it  is  wholly
         consistent with the policies of the current government, as well  as
         in the best interests of the country as a whole.


         The  ANC  views  the  Bill  as  a  milestone  in  the  process   of
         transforming the economy in order to undo  the  destructive  legacy
         of apartheid. Mining and related industries still  form  the  basis
         of the South  African  economy.  Any  piece  of  legislation  which
         attempts, as the Bill does, to significantly change  the  ownership
         and control of  such  a  sector,  will  arouse  significant  public
         controversy and opposition, especially  from  established  players.
         This  Bill  has  done  so,  and  sharply   divergent   views   have
         characterised the  extensive  public  hearings  and  deliberations.
         Nevertheless, the ANC regards the process of  deliberation  on  the
         Bill as thorough and in keeping with the exercise of the duties  of
         Parliament.


         During the  public  hearings,  various  alarming  allegations  were
         raised against the Bill, including  unconstitutionality,  violation
         of bilateral and multilateral  trade  agreements,  and  undermining
         security  of  tenure.  The  ANC  has  carefully  considered   these
         potential pitfalls in the Bill, and is of the  opinion  that  these
         are without substance. Where possible, amendments were made to  the
         Bill to accommodate substantive stakeholder concerns,  particularly
         with respect to  rural  communities  which  currently  own  mineral
         rights, and the inclusion of  a  labour  component  in  the  social
         plan. Other amendments were made to tighten up  certain  regulatory
         aspects  of  the  Bill,  and  to  lower  barriers  to  entry.   The
         fundamental principles of the Bill were  not  compromised  in  this
         process.


     D.     Minority views


         1. Democratic Party
              The Democratic Party cannot support this Report.


              Firstly, it believes that the process for passing the Bill  in
              the  Committee  has  been  rushed   and   totally   inadequate
              contemplation has been given to the 80-odd representations  to
              Parliament on the Bill. While some of the representations went
              to  the  principle  of  the  Bill,  many   were   constructive
              suggestions which addressed the structure and coherency of the
              Bill.


              Secondly, areas of the Bill which  have  not  adequately  been
              addressed, are the following:


              *   The Bill's direct assault on the property rights clause of
                the Constitution


              *   Security of tenure


              *   The Minister's discretion


              *   Lack of appeal to courts


              *   Smooth transition from old  order  rights  and  new  order
                rights


              *   Beneficiation


              It must be emphasised that the Democratic Party is  supportive
              of the broad empowerment and social objectives  of  the  Bill,
              but  believes  that  the  delicate   balance   between   these
              objectives and the need for the continued investment into  the
              industry has not been achieved.


         2. United Democratic Movement


              The UDM supports the Bill in principle,  and  recognises  that
              the Bill is in line with the transformation of the mining  and
              petroleum  industry.  The  UDM  further  recognises  that  the
              objects of the Bill are internationally accepted and that  the
              Bill seeks to address the inequalities and imbalances  of  the
              past and to promote equitable access to the  nation's  mineral
              wealth to all people in South Africa. There is no  doubt  that
              the Bill seeks to promote economic growth and  development  in
              South Africa.


              The UDM's concerns centre around the following:


              (a) Expansion of opportunities  for  previously  disadvantaged
                  persons


                  The UDM finds  it  irreconciliable  that  some  previously
                  disadvantaged   communities    or    persons    to    whom
                  opportunities are supposed to be expanded,  are  in  terms
                  of the Bill going to be dispossessed of their mineral  and
                  surface rights. The Bill does not give recognition to  the
                  rights in  land,  inclusive  of  mineral  rights,  of  the
                  communities who have occupied  and  developed  their  land
                  for several generations and centuries, e.g.  the  Bafokeng
                  and Mphahlele tribes.


              (b) Land surface rights


                  Black  communities  were  harassed,  tortured  and   their
                  leaders detained and dispossessed of their  land  by  both
                  the colonial and apartheid regimes. They were made  aliens
                  in the land of their  birth.  Black  South  Africans  will
                  never forget apartheid's  forceful  removals,  which  were
                  intended to deprive them of  their  ancestral  land,  e.g.
                  King Makgoba,  Chief  Letsoalo,  King  Sekhukhune,  Matoks
                  communities and Chief  Machaka  and  Chief  Ramokgopa,  to
                  name a few. It will be unfortunate  if  black  communities
                  will still find themselves subjected to  the  above  evils
                  in terms of clauses 50, 51 and 52 of  the  Bill.  The  UDM
                  believes and proposes that the provisions of clause  50(1)
                  should not apply to previously  disadvantaged  people,  in
                  particular those who were affected by the  obnoxious  laws
                  of  forceful  removals  by  the  colonial  and   apartheid
                  regimes. Alternatively a clause could  be  inserted  which
                  will provide that  previously  disadvantaged  people  will
                  not be subjected to forceful removals.


                  The UDM proposes further that communities which  own  land
                  or who are occupiers of land where prospecting and  mining
                  operations are to be conducted, should not be affected  by
                  the provisions of clause 51(1) and  (2).  The  communities
                  should instead  be  assisted  to  obtain  prospecting  and
                  mining rights, while the State remains  the  custodian  of
                  the nation's mineral  rights.  The  Minister's  powers  to
                  expropriate  in  the  present  format  of  the  Bill  will
                  undoubtedly result in confrontation and  forceful  removal
                  of a large number of communities, as was the  case  during
                  the dark days of the  apartheid  regime.  The  UDM  agrees
                  with the Legal Resource  Centre  (LRC)  that  one  of  the
                  primary purposes  underlying  the  enactment  of  sections
                  25(6) to 25(8) of the Constitution is the need to  redress
                  the injustices flowing from the failure  of  the  colonial
                  and apartheid regimes to afford  recognition  and  dignity
                  to land  rights  held  in  terms  of  indigenous  law.  It
                  further agrees with the LRC that the Land Restitution  Act
                  gives  effect  to  the  constitutional  requirement  (i.e.
                  section 25(7)  of  the  Constitution)  to  provide  either
                  restitution or equitable redress to people or  communities
                  dispossessed of their land after 19 June 1913 as a  result
                  of racially  discriminatory  laws  and  practices  of  the
                  past. The Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs is  on
                  course in implementing  this  constitutional  requirement.
                  We strongly believe that the provisions  of  sections  50,
                  51 and 52 of the Bill  will  defeat  the  object  of  land
                  restitutions.
              (c) Constitutionality of Bill


                  The UDM agrees that the Constitutional  Court  in  one  of
                  its previous judgments found that it  was  extremely  rare
                  to make  mention  of  mineral  rights  within  a  property
                  clause in some other  Constitutions,  and  that  it  could
                  certainly  not  be  said  to  be  a  universally  accepted
                  fundamental  right.  In  case  of  Lebowa  Mineral   Trust
                  Beneficiaries Forum vs. President  of  South  Africa,  the
                  ruling by Judge J Daniels  was  based  on  the  fact  that
                  mineral rights were not protected by  section  25  of  the
                  Constitution. The UDM  believes,  however,  that  Judge  J
                  Daniels  based,  with  all  humility,  his  finding  on  a
                  misunderstanding  of  the   previous   judgment   of   the
                  Constitutional Court. It is true that  the  Constitutional
                  Court never found that  the  constitutional  drafters  did
                  not intend to protect mineral rights in section 25.
                  The UDM's information is that  the  Lebowa  Mineral  Trust
                  Beneficiaries Forum still contend  strongly  that  section
                  25(4) of the Constitution does not  restrict  the  concept
                  of property to land  only,  but  that  whatever  the  wide
                  scope of the constitutional meaning of  property  may  be,
                  it would include the real rights in respect  of  land.  It
                  is  for  this  reason  that  the  Lebowa   Mineral   Trust
                  Beneficiaries   Forum   is   preparing   to    test    the
                  constitutionality of the Abolition of the  Lebowa  Mineral
                  Trust Act in the Constitutional Court.  The  UDM  believes
                  that a land-owner remains owner until  such  time  as  the
                  mineral is severed from the earth.


              (d) Royalties


                  The UDM supports the view that provision  for  payment  of
                  royalties should be made in the money bill,  and  proposes
                  consequently  that  both  the   Minerals   and   Petroleum
                  Resources Bill and the money bill  be  considered  by  the
                  National Assembly concommittantly. The  UDM  proposes,  in
                  conclusion, that royalties should be paid  to  communities
                  in whose areas mining takes place.


              (e) Transitional arrangements


                  The UDM's area of concern in this regard  is  security  of
                  tenure over existing prospecting and  mining  and  mineral
                  rights,   existing   agreements   between    mining    and
                  exploration companies and holders of "old  order"  rights,
                  and compensation for foreign investments made  into  South
                  African minerals industry. The UDM's main concern is  that
                  ambiguity and uncertainty which may exist upon passage  of
                  the Bill may scare foreign investors and thus  defeat  the
                  objects of the Bill.


                  The UDM suggest therefore, in conclusion,  that  the  Bill
                  be  sent  to  the  Constitutional  Court  for  concurrence
                  before it is promulgated.


     E.     Conclusion


         The Committee wishes to  express  its  appreciation  to  all  those
         stakeholders who  made  submissions  to  and  interacted  with  the
         Committee during its deliberations on the Bill.

4.    Report of the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional  Affairs
     on Protocol on Establishment of African Court  on  Human  and  Peoples'
     Rights, dated 26 June 2002:


         The  Select  Committee  on  Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,
         having considered the request for approval  by  Parliament  of  the
         Protocol on the Establishment of the African  Court  on  Human  and
         Peoples'  Rights,  referred  to  it,   having   consulted   widely,
         including obtaining a legal opinion, and having noted that -


         1. in terms  of  section  167(3)(a)  of  the  Constitution  of  the
              Republic of South Africa, 1996 (hereafter referred to  as  the
              Constitution), the Constitutional Court is the  highest  court
              in the land in respect of all constitutional matters;


         2. in terms of article 50 of  the  African  Charter  on  Human  and
              Peoples'  Rights  (hereafter  referred  to  as   the   African
              Charter), the African Commission on Human and Peoples'  Rights
              (hereafter referred to as the  African  Commission)  can  only
              deal with a matter submitted to it after making sure that  all
              local remedies, if they exist, have been exhausted, unless  it
              is obvious to the African Commission  that  the  procedure  of
              achieving these remedies would be unduly prolonged;


         3. the jurisdiction of the African  Court  on  Human  and  Peoples'
              Rights (hereafter referred to  as  the  African  Court),  when
              established in terms of article  1  of  the  Protocol  on  the
              Establishment of the  African  Court  on  Human  and  Peoples'
              Rights (hereafter referred to as the Protocol), shall in terms
              of article 3(1) of  the  Protocol  extend  to  all  cases  and
              disputes submitted to it  concerning  the  interpretation  and
              application of the African Charter, the Protocol and any other
              relevant  human  rights  instrument  ratified  by  the  States
              concerned (in terms of article 7 of the Protocol  the  African
              Court shall apply the provisions of the  African  Charter  and
              any other relevant human rights  instrument  ratified  by  the
              States concerned);


         4. in terms of article 2 of the Protocol, the African Court  shall,
              bearing in mind the provisions of the Protocol, complement the
              protective mandate of the African Commission conferred upon it
              by the African Charter;


         5. if adopted, the Protocol will result in a  complementary  system
              of  protection  of  human  rights,  one  in   terms   of   our
              Constitution and the other in terms of the African Charter (in
              other words, a case relating to the protection of human rights
              in terms of the African Charter must  be  adjudicated  through
              our court system in terms of our Constitution before it can be
              dealt with in terms of the  African  Charter  by  the  African
              Court);


         6. it will not be possible to appeal on human rights  matters  from
              the Constitutional Court to the  African  Court  or  from  the
              African Court to the Constitutional Court;


         7. in terms  of  article  5  of  the  Protocol,  only  the  African
              Commission,  State  Parties  and   African   Intergovernmental
              Organisations have direct access to the African Court;


         8. in terms of  article  34(6)  of  the  Protocol,  access  to  the
              African Court may be  extended  to  relevant  Non-Governmental
              Organisations and individuals in certain respects;


         9. the two systems  will  largely  be  complementary  and  mutually
              reinforcing of each other (on the one hand, our Constitutional
              Court, in  terms  of  section  39(1)(b),  is  compelled,  when
              interpreting the Bill of  Rights,  to  consider  international
              law; in this regard the pronouncements of  the  African  Court
              will have a significant bearing  on  the  development  of  our
              human rights jurisprudence; on the  other  hand,  the  African
              Court  will,  in  terms  of  the  Vienna  Convention  and  the
              practices of international tribunals  of  a  like  nature,  be
              influenced by the pronouncements of our courts);


         10.     from a literal reading of articles  28(2)  and  30  of  the
              Protocol and a comparison thereof with section 167(3)  of  the
              Constitution, it has  been  suggested  that  there  may  be  a
              potential  conflict  (however,  in  view  of  the  above,  the
              possibility of a conflict actually happening is remote  within
              such a complementary system of protection of human rights);


         11.      in  terms  of  section   231(4)   of   the   Constitution,
              international agreements only become law in the Republic  when
              it is enacted into law by national legislation;


         recommends that-


              the Council, in terms of section 231(2) of  the  Constitution,
              approve the said Protocol.


         The Committee further resolves that if the Executive at  any  stage
         makes a declaration in terms  of  article  34(6)  of  the  Protocol
         accepting the competence  of  the  Court  to  receive  cases  under
         article  5(3),  such  a  declaration  shall  first  be  tabled   in
         Parliament for approval.


     Report to be considered.
