                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, I give notice that I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that according to the SA Institute of International Affairs -
       (a)  the Zimbabwean economy  is  suffering  the  fastest  decline  in
           general economic welfare and quality of life in history,  for  a
           country not at war;


       (b)  the prediction for the commercial farming sector is that it will
           produce about 25% of its normal agricultural production  in  the
           coming year, and famine stalks the land;


       (c)  exports are declining to below  the  level  of  one  billion  US
           dollars for the first time in 50 years, and that we  are  seeing
           accelerating  company  closures  and   soon   possibly   banking
           failures;


       (d)  it is unlikely that the government will be able to maintain even
           the limited services it currently provides; and


       (e)  inflation is accelerating further and a  collapse  of  financial
           institutions and equity markets can be expected soon, with  far-
           reaching consequences; and


  (2) in the light of the collapsing circumstances in Zimbabwe, calls  upon
       the Government to urgently revise its policies on Zimbabwe, including
       taking the necessary defensive actions and giving protection to South
       African citizens and interests in that country.

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, I give notice  that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with utter disgust the conduct of one Mr McCaps Motimele, until
       recently the Chairperson of the Council of Unisa, when,  having  been
       charged with  molesting  and  harassing  an  eminent  academic,  Prof
       Margaret Orr, resulting in her resignation from Unisa, which she  had
       served for many years with impeccable credentials, had  the  temerity
       and mind-boggling arrogance  to  suggest  that  the  lawsuit  brought
       against his person by Ms Orr  was  just  another  instance  of  anti-
       transformation forces manufactured  against  black  persons  in  high
       positions;


  (2) condemns Mr Motimele, the unrepentant mampara, for blandly suggesting
       that the Council of Unisa would pay the settlement of R150 000 to  Ms
       Orr, and would also pick up the  tab  for  the  costs  of  litigation
       amounting to about R350 000;


  (3) welcomes the decision of the vice-chancellor, Mr Barney Pityana,  and
       the Council for rejecting Mr Motimele's  ill-considered  and  obscene
       expectation  that  the  Council  would  play  Father  Christmas   and
       exonerate him for his x-rated activities by paying the costs  of  the
       lawsuit brought against him; and


  (4) congratulates Prof Orr for her courage and fortitude in  standing  up
       to this bully, and in doing so, becoming  a  shining  beacon  to  all
       women who find themselves in similar vulnerable circumstances against
       the mistaken power of uncouth men like McCaps Motimele.

Me C-S BOTHA: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) die Regering versoek om toe te sien dat  Suid-Afrikaanse  burgers  in
       Zimbabwe onmiddellik die versekering kry  dat  hulle  beskerming  sal
       geniet te midde van toenemende wetteloosheid;


  (2) versoek dat hul regmatige belange beskerm word;


  (3) voorts 'n beroep op die Regering doen om toe te sien dat mev Bibi von
       Abo, vrou van die Vrystaatse boer, mnr Crawford von Abo,  wat  gister
       onregmatig gearresteer is deur oorlogsveterane, alle  beskerming  van
       die  Suid-Afrikaanse  Hoëkommissaris  in  Zimbabwe,  mnr  Ndou,   sal
       ontvang, soos volgens persberigte gister belowe is, ten spyte daarvan
       dat sy vanoggend nog nie gekontak is nie; en


  (4) die hoop uitspreek dat President Mbeki sy stilte sal verbreek en Suid-
       Afrikaners die versekering sal gee dat sy gebrek aan  kommentaar  oor
       die aangeleentheid nie beteken dat dit sy goedkeuring wegdra nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms C-S BOTHA: Mr Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move -


  That the Council -


  (1) requests the Government to ensure  that  South  African  citizens  in
       Zimbabwe are reassured immediately that they would  be  protected  in
       the midst of increasing lawlessness;


  (2) requests that their lawful interests are protected;


  (3) further appeals to the Government that Mrs Bibi von Abo, wife of Free
       State farmer Mr Crawford von Abo, who was unlawfully arrested by  war
       veterans yesterday, would be given  every  protection  by  the  South
       African High Commissioner in Zimbabwe, Mr Ndou, as  was  promised  in
       newspaper reports yesterday, in  spite  of  the  fact  that  by  this
       morning she still had not been contacted; and


  (4) expresses the hope that President Mbeki will break  his  silence  and
       give South Africans the reassurance that his lack of comment  on  the
       matter does not mean that it has his approval.]

                  CALL FOR SUSPENSION OF MAYOR OF CAPE TOWN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the latest allegation  against  troubled  City  of
       Cape Town mayor, Gerald Morkel, about his  secret  acquisition  of  a
       residential plot at a discount of R175 000;


  (2) further  notes  that  this  follows  hot  on  the  heels  of  similar
       allegations by one Mr Harksen and a former Absa bank official  before
       the Desai Commission,  which  is  currently  probing  allegations  of
       misconduct during his time as Premier of the Western Cape;


  (3) expresses its contempt at the apparent double standards  demonstrated
       by the ``Diabolic Alliance'' for its  unwillingness  to  suspend  its
       tainted Western Cape leader; and


  (4) calls upon big mouth Tony Leon to show respect for the principles  of
       clean governance and immediately release Gerald Morkel from  all  his
       duties as pseudo-mayor of the City of Cape Town.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to  that  motion?
There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes a notice of motion.

                 NEW SERVICE CONDITIONS FOR DOMESTIC WORKERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Minister  of  Labour  and  his  department  on  the
       introduction of legislation that -


       (a)  ensures that urban domestic workers are paid a  minimum  monthly
           wage; and
       (b)  transforms the overall working conditions of  these  workers  so
           that they also enjoy the same protection as others;


  (2) notes that  domestic  and  farm  workers  have  long  been  the  most
       exploited category of employee, given the nature of the work they do,
       as was clearly reflected in the Special Assignment programme on  SABC
       3;


  (3) condemns the continuing abuse of foreign workers; and


  (4) expresses the hope  that  unscrupulous  employers  will  cease  their
       exploitative practices and will obey the law.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             SURGICAL REPAIR OF FULUFHELANI NETSHITUNGULU'S FACE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with  appreciation  and  admiration  the  work  of  surgeons  in
           repairing  the  face  of  the  11-year  old  girl,   Fulufhelani
           Netshitungulu, which was badly disfigured; and


       (b)  with amazement the way  the  girl's  face  had  swollen  out  of
           proportion as a result of an unusual condition she incurred when
           she was 4 years old;


  (2) highly appreciates the hospital's sponsorship of more than  R100  000
       towards this plastic surgery operation;


  (3) highly commends  the  two  surgeons,  Dr  Hennie  Roos  and  Dr  Mike
       Bouckaert, for having successfully performed the operation which  has
       boosted the lucky girl's esteem; and


  (4) commends Felicia Mabuza-Suttle's talk show for  having  brought  this
       child to the attention of surgical experts.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

      WELCOMING OF DELEGATES TO WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) extends a heartfelt welcome to all the heads of state  and  delegates
       from different countries around  the  globe  arriving  on  the  South
       African shore to attend the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development
       starting in Johannesburg on Monday, 26 August 2002;


  (2) wishes to assure them  of  the  unique  African  hospitality  in  our
       country which will become their home away from home over the next two
       weeks;


  (3) expresses our gratitude as one of the  youngest  democracies  in  the
       world to have been afforded the opportunity to host the  largest  and
       most diverse gathering of peoples in any country for an event of this
       kind; and


  (4) appreciates that their presence here will inspire a common nationhood
       under the theme: People, Planet, Prosperity.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        DISASTERS STRIKE EASTERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)
Nksz P C P MAJODINA: Mhlalingaphambili, ndenza  isiphakamiso  esingakhatshwa
sisilumkiso:

       ekhoyo kwanokuba uphuhliso luza kutsho luzinze.
(Translation of isiXhosa draft resolution follows.)

[Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, I am moving a motion without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) commiserates with the residents of the Eastern  Cape  on  the  latest
       disaster to strike the province, just as it was recovering from heavy
       snowfalls and veld fires that had hit the province last month; and


  (2) notes that the World Summit on Sustainable Development that  will  be
       held in our country, South  Africa,  will  focus  on  the  issues  of
       poverty and sustainable development.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Order!  I  note  that  no  interpretation  was
available for that motion without notice. The hon member  indicated  in  the
motion that the House should express its support  and  solidarity  to  those
affected by the recent floods in the Eastern Cape, and indicated  particular
concern that  the  suffering  had  followed  the  disaster  related  to  the
snowfalls, followed by fires in the Eastern Cape province.

She recommended that  the  House  consider  having  a  discussion  on  these
occurrences, in order to deliberate as to the  steps  necessary  to  provide
support to these communities.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great concern that a well-known South African farmer  from
       Bothaville  in  the  Free  State,  who  also  has  extensive  farming
       interests in Zimbabwe, Mr Crawford  von  Abo,  and  his  manager,  Mr
       Willem Klopper, were arrested on his farm in Zimbabwe yesterday;


  (2) further notes that this arrest could be a  direct  violation  of  the
       bilateral agreement between South Africa and Zimbabwe, which  clearly
       guarantees  the  protection  of  South  African-owned  property   and
       investments in Zimbabwe; and


  (3) also notes the New NP's call on the South African Government and  the
       Minister of Foreign Affairs to immediately  enter  into  negotiations
       with the Zimbabwean government to reaffirm the  protection  of  South
       African  property  and  investments  in  Zimbabwe  in  terms  of  the
       bilateral agreement.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to  that  motion?
[Interjections.] There  is  an  objection.  The  motion,  therefore  becomes
notice of a motion.

     TOWARDS INTEGRATED, SUSTAINABLE RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND URBAN RENEWAL

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy
Minister,  Ntombazana  Botha,  and  hon  members,  representatives  of   all
countries in the world are descending on our shores. They come as  delegates
on  whose  shoulders  devolves  the  responsibility  to  take  part  in  the
programme of the World Summit on Sustainable Development.

The event represents humanity's most  determined  and  promising  effort  to
save itself from the scourge of underdevelopment and the  attendant  problem
of poverty. As President Mbeki once said, the fact that we have been  chosen
to host such an  important  summit,  speaks  of  the  confidence  which  the
world's community of nations has in us. There is an unmistakable  conviction
that as a country, we have something of value to add to this  worthy  global
effort.

Ten years ago, at a similar gathering in  Rio,  Brazil,  it  was  recognised
that development - itself a multifaceted process - cannot be realised  on  a
sustainable basis, unless it is managed in a way which keeps all its  facets
in balance. Indeed, central  to  the  task  of  bringing  about  sustainable
development, is the maintenance of the balance between the economic,  social
and  environmental  aspects  of  development.  It  is  also  necessary   for
governments to ensure that such legislative,  administrative  and  executive
structures as they have within different spheres of  the  government  system
function as an integrated unit.

Since 1994 South Africa has been writing its own script on  the  modalities,
methods and processes of putting the country  on  the  path  of  sustainable
development. The Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme and  the
Urban Renewal Programme are our flagship  initiatives  in  this  regard.  We
have been and are continuing to look for innovative  ways  of  tackling  the
twin challenges of pervasive rural poverty and the growing pockets of  urban
poverty.

The Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme is a response to  the
reality that, as a result of their  historical  marginalisation,  the  rural
areas of our country remain the least endowed end of the continuum. Many  of
our people in these areas do not have  sustainable  sources  of  livelihood.
Our response through these two programmes creates  a  platform  that  allows
urban areas to  continue  growing  as  we  simultaneously  direct  resources
towards emulating economic growth in the rural areas.

This explains why, in the case of the rural  development  programme,  entire
districts have been designated as nodes, while in  the  case  of  the  urban
renewal programme we have only identified  a  particular  local  area  as  a
node. So, we allow Kimberley to grow on the path determined  by  the  height
of the diamond industry, but also put particular attention and resources  on
Galeshewe, so that it may also chart its own development path.

Since both Kimberley and Galeshewe fall within one  municipal  jurisdiction,
their developmental efforts will take place within the context of  a  single
integrated development plan. The integrated planning and  budgeting  process
which underpins the way in  which  the  two  areas  will  interrelate  going
forward, enables us to achieve the economies of scale. In addition  to  this
horizontal integration at local level, we shall also have to  integrate  the
efforts of various national and  provincial  departments.  This  integration
will ensure that we deliver a complete product.

The  potency  of  partnership  is  well-demonstrated  by  the   example   of
Unkhanyakude nodal municipality  in  the  KwaZulu-Natal  province.  In  this
node, there is a cashew nut production  and  packaging  project.  The  local
traditional leader, Inkosi Tembe,  together  with  the  Department  of  Land
Affairs, availed land for use in the production of cashew nuts. Old  Mutual,
Kagiso Trust and the Department of Provincial and Local Government  provided
financial support. Ntsika Enterprises and  the  Department  of  Agriculture,
through various training initiatives, helped to develop local  capacity  for
producing and marketing the product. The Department of Trade  and  Industry,
through the Industrial Development Corporation and  Itala  Bank,  identified
and sourced international markets.

The hearings held by permanent members of  this  House,  assessing  progress
with regard to the two programmes,  highlight  some  of  the  successes  and
challenges faced by the programmes in the nodes.  Some  success  areas  that
stand out from  the  report  include  the  demonstrable  commitment  to  the
programmes by various departments at provincial and  national  levels.  This
commitment  is  evidenced  by  increased  responsiveness  by  national   and
provincial spheres of government to the needs of local areas, as  identified
in the municipal integrated development  plans.  This  commitment  manifests
itself in the increased funding allocations to the  nodes.  Even  with  this
increased involvement,  some  challenges  still  persist  and  hon  members'
report has clearly highlighted this.

The most pressing one that needs urgent attention is the funding  of  anchor
projects.  Provinces  receive  a  substantial  share  of  nationally  raised
revenue. Focused investment by this sphere of government would  add  impetus
to project implementation in the nodes.

Communication amongst national and provincial departments, as  well  as  the
Houses of Parliament,  is  not  optimal  and  thus  undermines  the  overall
ability of the stakeholders from these structures. This is  a  matter  which
requires urgent attention.

Concerted and dedicated  private-sector  mobilisation  by  all  role-players
would yield visible support and increased  investment  in  the  nodes.  This
challenge extends to the involvement  of  state-owned  enterprises  such  as
Eskom and Telkom. The particular challenge here is not so much whether  they
are involved or not,  but  rather  how  they  are  involved  and  how  their
involvement  influences  their  resource-allocation  decisions  towards  the
attainment of sustainable solutions.

In conclusion, allow me to  reiterate  the  vital  contribution  to  poverty
alleviation by these two programmes. Having done that, though,  let  us  not
lose sight of the bigger context  within  which  we  are  undertaking  these
programmes. This context throws up the inherent  tension  between  sustained
approaches to development and fast-tracking delivery in attempting  to  make
a dent in poverty levels.

The challenge still remains that in our attempt to push back  the  frontiers
of poverty and underdevelopment, we should  not  compromise  sustainability.
If we do, we might as well have not been deemed worthy of hosting the  WSSD,
and the lessons and contributions - which I am convinced we can and have  to
make - would be eternally lost. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  Deputy  Minister,
I must say that we are, indeed,  very  much  honoured  in  this  House  this
afternoon for having both Ministers here. I also heard somebody saying  that
we have the department's new director-general in our midst as  well,  but  I
cannot confirm that. [Interjections.]

When this Government came into power in 1994,  it  inherited  a  country  of
gross inequities, with high unemployment and widespread poverty. To  address
this skewed state of affairs, the Government introduced  the  Reconstruction
and Development Programme, which entailed the following  key  subprogrammes:
meeting basic needs, developing human  resources,  democratising  the  state
and society, building the economy and implementing the main programme,  that
is, the RDP.

The architects of the RDP - that is, the unions, civic movements  and  other
civil society organisations  -  correctly  identified  the  major  cause  of
disparities in the economy and in development as being the consideration  of
development and business in isolation of the environment and society  around
it.

It is interesting to note that the Integrated Sustainable Rural  Development
Programme and the Urban Renewal Programme strategy is,  in  my  opinion,  an
elaboration and fast-tracking  of  the  five  key  programmes  of  the  RDP,
targeting certain poverty  pockets  without,  of  course,  neglecting  other
areas. The strategy also informs me that we have moved from  showing  people
how to catch fish to capacitating those  people  to  breed  the  fish  in  a
sustainable way, including how to develop and nurture this product.

When we say, ``The people shall govern'', we are not  necessarily  confining
governance to the legislators. We include business  and  civil  society,  so
that one's corporate ethics should reflect  that,  indeed,  one's  consumers
and the market are really  governing  one's  behaviour  and  attitude  as  a
businessperson. By so doing we all ensure  that  the  people  share  in  the
country's wealth.

Our combined delegation of Mpumalanga and the Northern Province visited  the
Elandskraal Farming Project, among  others.  This  visit  reflected  vividly
what could be achieved when the three spheres of government interact in  the
true spirit of co-operative governance in  a  constitutional  democracy.  We
met as partners in these spheres of government,  spurred  on  by  a  growing
awareness that there is mutual benefit in  enhancing  our  intergovernmental
relations.

This recognition of our roles will also ensure that each province  and  each
sphere will fulfil its commitment to the nodal project, not  as  an  act  of
benevolence, but driven by the sense of responsibility to ensure that  there
is sustainable work and security  for  all,  even  long  after  the  initial
project have been finalised. To this end, one  should  hasten  to  emphasize
that each sphere and each department should stick to the  agreed  timeframes
for the release and replenishment of funds, personnel and  other  resources,
so that the projects remain on track until finalisation.

Our work in these development nodes is informed by the President's state  of
the nation address in February 2000. We will note that  the  President  said
that development should continue in other areas outside of  the  development
nodes. As houses are  being  built,  water  and  sanitation  networks  being
installed in many areas and many other development projects  continuing,  we
should ensure the sustainability of the local economy  by  establishing  and
maintaining the local economic development forums in all communities.

It is interesting to note that innovations and initiatives  that  have  been
brought about by this LED forums can create, in the  form  of  business  and
jobs, wonders. As I am  standing  here,  I  am  a  living  witness  to  this
phenomenon.

Indeed, we feel much stronger after  our  visit.  We  are  not  standing  on
wobbly legs, informed by some form of  briefing  or  research,  but  we  are
informed by our own visit and observations. To that end we  can  confidently
declare that we are together in speeding up  change  and  fighting  poverty.
[Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, hon Minister,  Deputy  Minister  and  colleagues,
first of all I would like  to  appeal  to  the  staff  to  get  my  initials
correct: remember I am from the Eastern Cape, so I am ``E C'' and not ``E  M
Gouws''. Thank you very much! [Laughter.]

An unknown philosopher once said these very true words, and I quote:


  There is a past which is gone forever, but there is  a  future  which  is
  still our own.

The time has come for South Africa to concentrate on our future.  What  lies
behind us is history, but what lies ahead  of  us  and  how  we  tackle  our
obstacles is of the  utmost  importance.  We  will  succeed  in  making  our
country one of the greatest if  we  can  overcome  the  obstacles  in  rural
development  and  urban  renewal.  We  should  be  committed  to   promoting
sustainable cities and towns that fulfil the  promises  of  development  for
the inhabitants, in particular by  improving  the  lives  of  the  poor  and
promoting equity while contributing to the progress  of  the  country  as  a
whole.

The overall aim of our  focus  area  is  to  investigate  ways  of  reducing
vulnerability, generating sustainable livelihoods  and  eradicating  poverty
in  the  South  African  society.  The  experience  of  most  South  African
households is one of outright poverty  or  of  continuing  vulnerability  to
being poor. Many of the households have limited access to education,  health
care and nutritious food, as well as reliable sources  of  income,  shelter,
energy and clean water.

The poor, both  urban  and  rural,  often  live  in  marginal  and  degraded
environments. Poverty is multidimensional and complex. To  address  poverty,
we should identify research themes  such  as  the  environment  and  natural
resources utilisation;  integrated  food  security,  nutrition  and  health;
local development; understanding the informal  sector;  social  institutions
and networks; and service provision and management.

The environment  and  natural  resource  utilisation  theme  seeks  ways  of
reconciling the pressing need for economic growth, poverty  eradication  and
the maintenance of the environment. The second research  theme,  ie  health,
food security and nutrition, must seek ways of  making  all  South  Africans
well nourished and healthy through the improvement of households and food.

The  third  theme,  local  development,  is  to  research  and   investigate
relationships  between  various  forms  of  organised   society,   including
Government, NGOs, business and labour organisations, as well as  development
at a local level. The fourth theme, understanding the informal sector, is  a
response to the problem of persistently high rates of unemployment in  South
Africa, which indicates that the formal economy  is  unable  to  absorb  the
available labour.

The fifth theme, social institutions, investigates  the  meaning  of  social
capital  in  various  South  African  contexts.  The  sixth  theme,  service
provision and management, deals with issues such as the nature  of  poverty,
gender and feminisation  of  poverty,  homelessness,  housing  and  shelter,
morality, energy, water supply, recreation, tourism and agriculture.

Kwazulu-Natal, for  example,  is  a  microcosm  of  the  reconstruction  and
development problems facing South Africa. Hence, it is an  ideal  place  for
researching national development policy. The region allows urban, rural  and
environmental problems to be analysed. Establishing a  sustainable  economic
growth rate and  addressing  large-scale  inequality  and  poverty  are  the
critical development problems facing the region and the country.
Urban renewal is where we should start.  Planning  departments  must  ensure
that building standards are upheld so that people do  not  crowd  out  their
neighbours, destroy the character of the suburb, ruin  the  view  or  create
health hazards. Many people consider planning  regulations  a  nuisance  and
simply flout them. Good planning makes for good neighbours.

Due to apartheid planning, some areas are not  integrated  into  the  cities
and add to the urban sprawl. A Johannesburg town  planner  once  said:  ``We
have to live with it, but we do not  want  to  perpetuate  it''.  This  town
planner means that another strategy is to develop so-called activity  nodes,
where both private and public investments tend  to  concentrate.  This  will
offer the opportunity to locate a range of activities, from small  to  large
enterprises, which is often associated with mixed-views development.

One area that needs development is the strategy  on  the  environment.  City
planners must note that the lack of an accessible and functional open  space
system prohibits cities from becoming real world-class cities.  Open  spaces
fulfil numerous functions in the cities, including the protection  of  water
courses, recreation, entertainment, education, tourism and the provision  of
space for exchange and transaction, the so-called public squares.

On Friday, 26 October 2001, the  hon  Minister  Mufamadi  released  a  media
statement. He said that rural development and urban renewal programmes  were
on track. He  informed  the  Presidential  Co-ordinating  Council  that  his
department was aiming to demonstrate  visible  progress  in  the  Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Programme's  13  nodal  rural  areas  and  the
eight urban nodes by  January  2002.  He  added  that  after  a  process  of
consultation with politicians and officials in all  the  provinces,  he  was
satisfied that a programme of rural and urban development was on course.

During the week of 27 to 31  May  2002,  permanent  delegates  of  the  NCOP
visited the nodal points in the provinces. We had no clear guidelines as  to
what was to be evaluated. Nevertheless, it is now August 2002  and  we  have
not seen the development we were promised. There is a general  feeling  that
there is no full commitment by some departments with regard to full  support
of the nodes. Shortfalls of budgets also remain  a  concern  and  delay  the
progress of the projects.

There is, however,  a  positive  side  to  the  nodal  points.  Despite  the
difficulties, the areas have  been  put  on  the  national  map,  with  more
opportunities for development than before.

``Vasbyt'' is die woord wat ons in Afrikaans  gebruik  wanneer  dit  moeilik
gaan, maar wanneer omstandighede vereis dat ons slaag met wat  ons  aangepak
het. Om Suid-Afrika ook internasionale status te gee, moet  hierdie  program
vir die stedelike en plattelandse areas so gou  as  moontlik  geïmplementeer
word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[``Vasbyt'' is the word we use in Afrikaans when times  are  difficult,  but
also when circumstances require that we succeed in that which we  undertook.
In order to also give South Africa international status, this programme  for
the urban and rural areas should be implemented as quickly as possible.]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI:  Chairperson,  Minister,  Deputy  Minister,  comrades  and
colleagues, let me start off by saying that I come from a province that  has
changed its leadership three times. Therefore, one should  not  expect  much
from what we have to say today. [Interjections.]

When the President declared the  two  nodal  points  in  this  province  the
doomed alliance, led by Mrs Versfeld, was in power. [Interjections.]  As  we
had warned when the alliance was formed, it really died  without  delivering
to the poor, but had divided them.

Because they did not care to ensure  growth  in  underdeveloped  areas,  the
management of the city  council  chose  to  separate  Mitchells  Plain  from
Khayelitsha, thereby creating racial nodes instead of developing them.  This
has resulted in the council not differentiating between its  line  functions
and projects for urban renewal.

Responsibility for renewing Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain  lies  with  the
city council that chose to develop the already  developed  areas.  They  are
complaining and moaning about national not giving them money.

Nothing in the budget  of  the  past  June  makes  mention  of  the  renewal
projects or funds set  aside  for  that.  What  is  good,  though,  is  that
communities have their own initiatives and have demanded  that  the  council
shape  up.  More  visible  are  women  who  want  to  lead  the  process  of
development and play a central role in  making  sure  that  Khayelitsha  and
Mitchells  Plain  become  attractive  suburbs  and   not   gangster-infested
townships.

The Nelson Mandela Centre in  Mitchells  Plain  is  playing  a  central  and
positive role, and has ensured that there is participation by people  there.
The Khayelitsha Development Forum also runs parallel to the structure.
Let me just add that, instead of focusing on the work, the  two  spheres  of
Government existed before the co-operative governance between  the  ANC  and
the NNP drew their own structure.  Instead  of  looking  at  what  had  been
declared by the President, they created a new structure  called  ``The  Cape
Flats Renewal'', which was located in the Department  of  Community  Safety.
Versfeld would know more about this.

When it comes to the rural node in the Karoo, very,  very  little  has  been
done there. The municipality and the district council are doing their  best,
but they have nothing to work on. One has to  remember  that  the  Karoo  is
more like a desert. They even assumed that the DA-led provincial  government
was punishing them for having helped the poor.

What we also need to focus on as we discuss  and  debate  are  contributions
from other departments. Our understanding is that  Public  Works  should  be
fully involved in programmes  in  an  area  such  as  the  Karoo,  not  that
department only, but the Department of Transport, as well.
Beaufort West is an interchange between the Western Cape, the  Eastern  Cape
and the Northern Cape. And one has to make sure  that  when  servicing  that
area, one does not help people coming from the Western Cape only,  but  that
one also concentrates on the other provinces. This,  therefore,  means  that
all Government departments are supposed to  play  a  major  role.  Only  one
department has been noted to be  active  in  that  area,  and  that  is  the
Department of Social Development.

We noted that sustainable development is a process that will  foster  growth
in underdeveloped areas. It is a  system  that,  if  well  driven,  will  be
called ``Ugxoth' indlala''.

Abantu baza kuvuka bazenzele. Abafuni kwamkela,  koko  bafuna  uncedo  ukuze
bakwazi ukuzenzela, bakwazi ukuzixovela  nokuzibhakela.  Bafuna  ukuqiniseka
ukuba bayakwazi ukuzimela, babulawule ngokwabo  ubomi  babo.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[People are going to wake up and do things for themselves. They do not  want
to just receive things, but they want help so that they  could  start  doing
things for themselves, make dough and bake by themselves. They  need  to  be
sure that they can stand on their own and control their lives. [Applause.]]

Mr  Z  S  KOLWENI:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister  and
colleagues, allow me to use this occasion to give expression  to  what  gave
rise to the integrated sustainable development and urban renewal  programme.
Today we are in this high public office of our land on a  mandate  given  by
the people, primarily to ensure  that  their  lives  are  improved  for  the
better.

In executing this programme, people must begin to see a practical change  in
their day-to-day lives. They should be  able  to  access  basic  needs  like
clean  water  and  sanitation,  primary  health  care  delivery,  education,
affordable shelter, energy and road infrastructure.

However, it is not enough to generalise with reference  to  people,  because
there is a certain  category  of  people  or  social  class  that  has  been
discriminated  against  and  disadvantaged  worldwide.  This  social   class
continues to suffer even in developed democracies in the world.

I now want to refer to mothers. Be they single or  married,  women  are  the
backbone or pillar of every family.  From  sunrise  to  sunset  there  is  a
variety of unpaid labour that needs to be performed or activities that  need
to be carried out, and no one other than the  mother  is  charged  with  the
delivery of such services. I wish to draw the attention  of  my  menfolk  to
the fact that they do that without any specific sequence.

By ``unpaid labour performed by women''  we  mean  the  rearranging  of  the
entire house, from the bedroom to the kitchen, so that the men  can  have  a
place to appreciate and finally retire to at the end of an exhausting  day's
work.

In the rural lifestyle the  situation  is  even  worse,  because  the  whole
family depends on the mothers to deliver water to the house. The mother  has
to go out to the veld, forest  or  fields  to  pick  up  the  wood  that  is
required to produce energy in order to  prepare  meals  to  feed  the  whole
family.

Mothers by and large struggle with less or  no  family  support  at  all  in
bringing up children, from infants to those of school-going age.  All  these
painstakingly long hours of labour  go  unnoticed  or  unrecognised.  It  is
regrettable or rather unfortunate to learn that in  some  communities  there
is still  a  mindset  that  justifies  and  associates  this  practice  with
traditional or cultural norms.

In our democratic new South Africa, our Government, led by  President  Thabo
Mbeki - having adopted  the  fundamental  principles  of  human  rights  and
committed itself to implementing them - has  placed  on  the  transformation
agenda the question of rural development, with  a  view  to  addressing  the
legacy of gender inequality across our society. Our Cabinet  has  considered
it necessary to mobilise all its resources to address this  problem  through
an integrated development approach, and it is now evident  that,  gradually,
the army of unemployed women and youth will benefit.

The current initiatives taken by our President to set  up  projects  in  the
nodal points have raised a ray of hope in our  people.  This  is  a  typical
example of our Government's commitment. Our  President  has  called  on  the
nation to have  a  sense  of  voluteerism,  partnership  and  patriotism  in
building a better life for all.

When we visited the nodal points  in  the  North  West  during  constituency
week, we  observed  some  positive  signs  in  the  form  of  projects  that
translated into radical gender-equality transformation.  The  first  project
comprised 2 600 hectares of land and a herd of 50 cattle owned by six  women
in a rural village. There was only one windmill to supply  water  which  is,
of course, not enough, but the Department of  Water  Affairs  is  addressing
this problem.

There was another cattle-farming project  of  251  cattle,  which  was  also
owned by women. A third project, with 76 goats, was also owned by  15  women
from the village.  We  were  impressed  to  learn  that  the  Department  of
Agriculture was giving every necessary support  to  these  women,  including
skills training.

All project participants convinced us that a wish list of  all  their  needs
and shortcomings is on the table of the MEC for  local  government,  who  is
ever so willing to offer  advice  to  the  Kgalagadi  District  Municipality
Council.

However, we also noted a number of challenges that need to be  addressed  so
as to sustain the viability of these efforts. We noted a need for  community
policing measures to scale down the rate of stock theft. The access road  to
the area should be improved, as should the fencing of grazing  camps.  There
is also a need for additional windmills and boreholes for water supply.

It was suggested that the Department  of  Public  Works  play  a  meaningful
role. Funding allocation has also been noted, and the hon the  Minister  has
already alluded to this.

Finally, I wish to say, with regard to all these efforts, that a journey  of
a thousand miles begins with the first step. We shall overcome.  [Applause.]


Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister  and  hon
members, local government has been assigned the critical role  of  reshaping
and strengthening local communities as a basis for building  and  sustaining
a democratic, prosperous and nonracial society. Under apartheid there was  a
systematic underinvestment in municipal infrastructure in  areas  that  were
arbitrarily designated black. This deprived millions of people of access  to
basic services, including water, sanitation, refuse collection and roads.

Given these enormous inequalities and the despair this  occasioned,  it  was
normal for people to expect an improvement in their living  conditions  once
we established our new democracy. For them, the hope for a better  life  was
closely linked to the arrival of democracy.

It  is  our  task  to  make  sure  that  we  respond  decisively  to   their
expectations  and  development  needs.  The  challenge  of   meeting   these
expectations is greatest in the rural areas where underinvestment in  basic,
social infrastructure has been the  worst.  While  the  political  obstacles
that prevented equitable social advancement for rural  people  have  largely
been removed, the extent to which this translated into  a  more  qualitative
life for the people in the rural areas is not yet clear.

Some people may feel that the pace of development in  our  rural  and  urban
areas is not fast enough. We need to keep in  perspective  the  enormity  of
the challenges that the ANC as Government face. A lack of understanding  may
lead to unreasonable expectations, resulting in frustrated communities  that
do not appreciate the work that has already been  done  and  the  strategies
that the ANC is putting into place to deal with their concerns.  To  prevent
this from happening, it is critical that elected representatives be seen  to
be responding to the people's expectations  in  both  our  rural  and  urban
areas.

It is in this context that we must  view  the  provincial  visit  that  were
undertaken by the National Council of Provinces to the various nodal  points
identified by the President in terms of  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural
Development Programme and Urban Renewal Programme.

These  visits  have  set  the  scene  for   a   greater   co-operation   and
participation by communities in their own developmental processes.  We  must
commend the National Council of Provinces for the initiative they had  taken
in visiting these nodal points, and for allowing communities  to  air  their
views on problems experienced  in  implementing  development  programmes  in
their respective areas.

One of the greatest benefits of frequent interaction between  the  NCOP  and
communities in our various provinces is the opportunity that  this  provides
to inform communities of legislation  and  policies  that  shape  rural  and
urban development. It affords us the opportunity to make  communities  aware
of programmes being implemented by line-function departments,  such  as  the
land  redistribution  programme,  poverty  relief  programmes,  agricultural
support services and other social services and grants that are available.

By being involved in the national legislative process, members of  the  NCOP
are  potentially  powerful  sources  of  information  to  rural  and   urban
communities around these developmental issues. As the  institution  mandated
with the responsibility to  monitor  and  promote  co-operation  across  the
different tiers of Government, these visits  have  also  provided  the  NCOP
with an opportunity to  gauge  the  effectiveness  of  intergovermental  co-
operation in  implementing  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development
Programme and the Urban Renewal Programme.

Based on the principles of integrated development, public  participation  in
the processes, democracy and  nation-building,  the  Integrated  Sustainable
Rural Development Programme and the Urban Renewal Programme are  rural-  and
urban-specific implementation programmes which set up the framework  of  our
Government  to  implement  our  vision  of  the  kind  of  rural  and  urban
communities we want to create.

Both the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme  and  the  Urban
Renewal Programme are also powerful allies  in  our  struggle  to  eradicate
poverty. According to the Department of Social  Development,  about  11%  of
poverty relief expenditure during 2001 was  on  projects  that  are  located
within 12 of the designated integrated sustainable rural  development  nodal
points.

In addition, more than R2 million has been spent in six of the  eight  urban
renewal programmes during the same period, benefiting  some  2  036  people,
particularly in the areas of youth development and HIV/Aids.

As part of our oversight function, it  is  essential  that  we  monitor  the
progress  of  local  councillors  and   departmental   officials   who   are
responsible for the above programmes. We must make sure  that  they  are  in
fact co-operating and implementing these programmes in the identified  nodal
points.

Governments across the African continent face many challenges. The  greatest
must be meeting the legitimate expectations of their  people.  The  hundreds
of millions of Africans who still live in abject poverty want to  experience
a tangible improvement in their  own  lives.  While  it  is  essential  that
governments across the African  continent  should  respond  to  the  poverty
crisis to which their people are subjected, they need to  go  beyond  simply
reacting to this crisis.

If developments across the continent are to be successful  and  sustainable,
they need to be guided by a clear vision of the kind of  continent  that  we
want to build and a plan for its  achievement.  This  vision  and  plan  are
captured in Nepad. The objective of Nepad is to eradicate poverty in  Africa
and to place African countries, both individually  and  collectively,  on  a
path of sustainable growth and development. For Nepad to succeed in  placing
the continent on a path of sustainable development,  it  is  essential  that
governments,  both  individually  and  collectively,  work  to  promote  the
principles of peace, security, human rights, sound economic  management  and
democratic governance.

It is undoubtedly so that the preamble to Agenda 21, created  at  the  first
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is even more  true  today  than  it  was  10
years ago. It says, and I quote:


  Humanity stands at a defining moment in history. We are confronted with a
  perpetuation of disparities between and within nations;  a  worsening  of
  poverty,  hunger,  ill  health  and  illiteracy;   and   the   continuing
  deterioration of the ecosystems on which we depend for our wellbeing.

After years of extreme colonial oppression and exploitation,  our  continent
is indeed characterised by all of the above. How then do we turn  this  tide
around? How do we make Africa an equal partner in  sustainable  development,
to preserve a world in which future generations can and  will  prosper?  How
do we tackle and eradicate poverty, while at  the  same  time  managing  and
protecting our fragile ecosystem? The answer to this conundrum of  questions
lies in the convergence of Nepad and Agenda 21.

For us to succeed in improving the living standards  of  people  across  the
African continent in a sustainable way, it is essential that the  programmes
and objectives of Agenda 21 are successfully incorporated  into  Nepad.  The
two processes cannot exist separately. Agenda  21  is  an  action  plan  for
sustainable development, while Nepad is  a  pledge  by  African  leaders  to
promote the active participation of Africa in the  world  economy  and  body
politic.

The successful implementation of Nepad  is,  therefore,  essential  for  the
sustainable development of Africa. Without Nepad, the  struggle  to  sustain
development and progress on our continent will be  futile.  It  is  in  this
context that we must view ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, hon  Minister,  Deputy  Minister,  comrades  and
colleagues, a very good afternoon. I just want to  confirm  one  thing  that
has been said by the hon Gouws, and that is that  the  Minister's  statement
that we are on track is, indeed, true. [Interjection.]

Ms P C P MAJODINA: She does not know that!

Ms J L KGOALI: Another thing is, a child who does not want to  listen,  will
do exactly what the hon Gouws was doing here. Instead  of  focusing  on  the
Eastern Cape or establishing what the mandate of the people who went to  the
provinces to look into these issues was,  she  decided  to  go  to  all  the
provinces, gallivanting without a clear vision of what  she  wanted  to  see
happening in the Eastern Cape, where there  are  serious  problems,  as  has
been indicated by other hon members. [Interjections.]

Gauteng has only  two  urban  renewal  nodes,  and  that  is  Alexandra  and
Kliptown. [Interjections.]

Ms J L KGOALI: I will come back to the hon Raju! [Laughter.]

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Tell him, Sis Joyce, tell him! [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order,  hon  members!
[Interjections.]

Ms J L KGOALI: I want to  focus  on  these  two  historical  places  in  the
Gauteng province. I am going to single out Alexandra, precisely  because  it
is surrounded by suburbs. It is an island  that  is  surrounded  by  suburbs
that have everything, while it has nothing. [Interjections.]

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Raju, listen!

Ms J L KGOALI: Alexandra has  4 000  houses  and  34  000  shacks  sprawling
around the banks of the polluted  Jukskei  River.  It  is  an  urban  desert
compared to the densely forested suburbs that are its close  neighbours,  ie
Sandton, Kelvin and the rest.

The apartheid government inflicted a series of short-sighted  town  planning
nightmares on it, which were topped up  with  many  years  of  neglect.  Its
residents have never enjoyed a decent life. However,  on  8  February  2001,
our own President, Thabo  Mbeki,  in  his  opening  address  to  Parliament,
announced that  R1,3  billion  was  to  be  spent  on  redeveloping  greater
Alexandra over a period of seven years.

Members will recall that Alexandra is very rich in history and culture.  Our
former President, Nelson Mandela, comes from Alexandra. To us it has  a  lot
of history and culture. As we are  talking  today,  improvements  have  been
made, ie new houses and roads have been built. We thank  the  department  of
local government and housing in the province for that. Of  course,  we  know
that they could not have done that without the  funding  they  receive  from
the national Department of Provincial and Local Government.

Also, one wants to thank the partnership formed with various  organisations,
including organisations  such  as  Food  and  Tree  for  Africa,  which  has
contributed to ensuring that Alexandra will never  be  the  same  again.  Of
interest are a  number  of  programmes  that  have  been  put  in  place  in
Alexandra, ranging from small to big business, human  resources  development
and many others.

As part of the spin-offs of the World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,
Alexandra will receive  a  valuable  windfall  in  the  form  of  a  hi-tech
multimedia resource centre. This gift, donated by the Norwegian  government,
is a legacy of the summit.  The  16  computers  and  the  call-centre  video
machines, cameras and screens will be moved to  Alexandra  when  the  summit
ends. A better life, indeed, for Alexandra. [Applause.]

As I have indicated, my reason for selecting  Alexandra  is  its  historical
background. Together with Alexandra, we have another historical place  which
is called Kliptown. Kliptown is where the congress of the people  was  held;
that is where our Freedom Charter comes from.

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Gouws does not know that!

Ms J L KGOALI: Yes, indeed, she  would  never  know  that!  That  place  was
neglected in the same  way  as  Alexandra  township.  Because  of  the  poor
planning of the then government, the  place  is  very  shabby.  Kliptown  is
different  from  Alexandra  township.  While  Alexandra  is  surrounded   by
beautiful houses, members would know that  Kliptown  is  surrounded  by  our
houses ... ``laphaya emikhukhwini''. [the shacks]

There are two things that are different here. Because of the  commitment  of
our President  to  ensuring  that  we  have  a  better  life  for  all,  our
delegation that went to Gauteng actually saw a better and a  more  developed
Kliptown than the one that was there before, ie those  who  knew  it  before
saw the difference.

Connecting roads have been built and completed. On  26  June  the  soil  was
turned by the Deputy President for the building of  the  Kliptown  monument.
An informal business area will also be located there, because the  area  has
quite a large number of informal businesses.

The work that has got underway gives hope to  the  people  of  Gauteng,  all
thanks to the  Gauteng  government's  department  of  local  government  and
housing, and the national Department of Provincial and Local  Government.  A
presidential project called the Newtown Housing  Precinct  was  launched  on
the same day on which the members of the NCOP, together with the members  of
the legislature, visited the area before going  to  the  two  nodal  renewal
areas.

It is important that  there  is  co-ordination  between  the  Department  of
Provincial and Local Government and the Department of  Public  Works,  which
is essential when it comes to the Community-based  Public  Works  Programme.
Therefore, we want to appeal that the work be co-ordinated  to  ensure  that
the Community-based Public Works Programme is effective  in  rebuilding  our
roads in the townships. This will go a long way  in  building  on  the  work
that has already been done by local government.

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, aangesien die eerste woorde van  die  voorwoord
tot Agenda 21, waarna reeds gedeeltelik verwys is deur vorige  sprekers,  so
belangrik is, vandag miskien meer as 10 jaar gelede, wil ek ook  begin  deur
daarna te verwys. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, considering the fact that the first  words  of
the preamble to Agenda 21, which has already been referred  to  in  part  by
previous speakers, are so important, perhaps more so  today  than  10  years
ago, I will also begin by referring to them.]


  Humanity stands at a defining moment in history. We are confronted with a
  perpetuation of disparities between and within nations,  a  worsening  of
  poverty,  hunger,  ill  health  and  illiteracy,   and   the   continuing
  deterioration of the ecosystems on which we  depend  for  our  wellbeing.
  However,  integration  of  environmental  and  development  concerns  and
  greater attention to them will lead to the  fulfilment  of  basic  needs,
  improved  living  standards  for  all,  better  protected   and   managed
  ecosystems and a safer, more prosperous future.  No  nation  can  achieve
  this on its own, but together we  can  -  in  a  global  partnership  for
  sustainable development.

Die vraag wat beantwoord  moet  word,  ook  op  die  komende  Johannesburgse
beraad, is hoe ver daar gevorder is met  hierdie  hoë  ideale.  Dit  is  van
spesiale belang vir Afrika, vir  Suid-Afrika,  en  vir  ander  ontwikkelende
lande, want dit moet nou tot uitvoering gebring word, sodat armoede  en  die
ongelyke  speelveld  tussen   ontwikkelende   en   ontwikkelde   lande   nou
daadwerklik aangespreek word.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The question that should be answered, also  at  the  upcoming  Johannesburg
summit, is how far we have managed to  progress  with  these  lofty  ideals?
This is of particular significance for Africa, for  South  Africa,  and  for
other developing countries, because this has to be put into effect  now,  in
order for poverty and the unequal  playing  fields  between  developing  and
developed countries to be urgently addressed.]

What - and I think this question should be asked, answered and kept in  mind
by all of us - really is sustainable development? The  World  Commission  on
Environment and Development produced an influential report in  1987,  namely
Our Common Future. It introduced the concept of sustainable  development  as
a focal point between the interests of development  and  those  of  resource
conservation. Sustainable development entails providing  for  the  needs  of
the  current  generation  without  compromising  the   ability   of   future
generations to provide for their own needs.

The articulation of a vision of sustainable development in Africa is  rooted
in Nepad and will be based on a fresh set of human, spiritual  and  economic
values  that  address  the  central  issues  of  poverty   and   inequality.
Sustainable development requires the integration  of  action  in  three  key
areas, namely economic growth and equity; conserving natural  resources  and
the environment; and, thirdly, social development.

The theme chosen for the World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  namely
"People, Planet and Prosperity" is, therefore,  very  apt.  However,  it  is
vital  that  social,  economic  and  environmental  needs   are   considered
together. The debate should not be  about  environment  versus  development,
but environment and development. It is hard to optimise development,  whilst
optimising, at the same time, the ability of the environment to continue  to
deliver life-supporting services.

If social and economic issues are addressed  separately  from  environmental
issues, ecological and social collapse are certain. Economic  and  political
reform are also required to ensure that the environment  is  treated  as  an
integral part of social and economic development, and not as an  alternative
to it.

At present nearly half of all South Africans do not have proper  housing  or
access  to  clean  drinking  water;  only  60%  have  electricity;  16%  are
functionally illiterate;  unemployment  is  rife,  20%  of  households  have
incomes of less than R500 per month; and the inflation  rate  is  too  high,
whilst growth and GDP are too low.

Before man's intervention, South Africa was richly endowed with a  diversity
of natural resources. These have, however, been depleted  and  degraded,  in
some cases to the extent where they cannot be replaced or  restored.  Twenty
five percent of terrestrial habitats and half  of  all  wetlands  have  been
converted to other land uses. All South African rivers have been  dammed  or
modified to provide water for domestic, industrial  and  agricultural  uses,
yet there is still a water shortage in our country.

Many plant and  animal  species  have  become  endangered  through  loss  of
habitat or through overcollection, and the number of extinct plants  doubled
between 1980 and 1995. Soil is eroded in  our  country  eight  times  faster
than it is replaced. Large amounts of waste products are released  into  the
air, water and soil, changing the climate, making water unsuitable  for  use
and reducing the productivity of vegetation. Our capacity to  deal  properly
with our waste is insufficient at present,  and  predicted  to  become  even
more limited in future.

In order to meet our  national  goals  of  providing  basic  needs,  equity,
employment, economic growth  and  an  improved  quality  of  life,  we  need
ecosystems that function properly. The degraded state of many ecosystems  in
our country, however, means that they are not able to meet the  needs  of  a
large population such as  ours.  The  rapid  population  growth  means  that
ecosystems  are  under  even  greater  pressure  not  only  to  continue  to
function, but also to support even more people.

Recent  political  reforms  such  as  our  new  Constitution;  several   new
environmental  policies;  the  signing  of  international  agreements;   the
development of  a  participatory  approach  to  policy-making;  and  greater
transparency at all levels  of  Government  have  laid  the  foundation  for
sustainable development in South Africa. Other  positive  factors  are  that
environmental issues and  environmental  education  have  been  included  in
Curriculum 2005.

It is, however, essential that these political  reforms  are  backed  up  by
financial and human  resources  in  order  to  implement  them  effectively.
Population factors like fertility and migration must be addressed  in  order
to stabilise demand for resources and production of wastes, to  be  able  to
meet the basic needs of all South Africans and improve the quality  of  life
for present and future generations.

In line with international trends, the Development Bank of  Southern  Africa
predicted a drop in  South  Africa's  fertility  rate  if  quality  of  life
improves. This would trigger a positive feedback loop whereby a  decline  in
the fertility rate would slow the rate of population  increase,  stabilising
or even reducing the demand for natural  resources.  This  would,  in  turn,
help ensure sustainability of resources in the long  term  and  provide  for
future  generations,  leading  to  an  ever-improving  quality  of  life  as
technology improves.

South Africa is well-endowed with  natural  resources  for  development  and
food security. In addition, all the right policies are nearly  in  place  to
put our country firmly on a sustainable development ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  member,
your time has expired. Even the extra one minute you  were  given  is  over!
[Applause.]

Mr T S SETONA:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  fellow
colleagues, comrades and special delegates  from  provinces,  clearly  there
can be no denying  that  the  27  April  1994  democratic  breakthrough  has
heralded a new chapter of hope to the masses  of  our  people  in  both  the
rural and the urban areas of our land. This new chapter of hope has  brought
to the fore many challenges that have to be resolved by  men  and  women  at
the helm of leadership in our country, in order to have a  better  life  for
all.

The 1913 Land Act and subsequent  other  separatist  pieces  of  legislation
were instruments meant to institutionalise  land  deprivation,  poverty  and
the underdevelopment of the majority of our  people.  Through  many  decades
before  1994,  the  spatial  development  planning  in   our   country   was
consciously geared towards establishing and developing two  nations  in  our
fatherland, ie the nation of the rich and the nation of  the  poor,  divided
by rail lines in the urban areas,  and  the  concentration  of  millions  of
indigenous people in the Bantustans and farms as suppliers of  cheap  labour
to the rich white farmers and the industrialists in the cities.

It is important to understand the historical context that  has  created  the
challenges ... [Interjections.] ... we are grappling with today, as a  basis
for forging a common vision  and  united  platform  to  attack  poverty  and
underdevelopment in our country. Our failure to  understand  our  past  will
lead to artificial interventions, which will only serve  to  widen  the  gap
between the rich and the poor. It is,  therefore,  important  to  understand
that this past is not divine, but is man's creation, hence the need  for  it
to be changed by men and women, not in  some  distant  future,  but  in  our
lifetime.

In response to those segregationist policies of  development,  the  greatest
historic convention by the men and  women  of  our  country  of  all  races,
classes  and  religious  persuasion  assembled  in  Kliptown  in   1955   to
conceptualise and develop a vision  for  a  South  Africa  free  of  hunger,
social deprivation, landlessness and underdevelopment, where  all  can  live
in peace  and  brotherhood,  irrespective  of  race,  ethnicity,  class  and
religious persuasion.

This august assembly of 26 June 1955 in Kliptown called, amongst others,  on
all South Africans and the world to  acknowledge  that  the  land  shall  be
shared amongst those who work it; secondly, the people shall  share  in  the
country's wealth. We are debating this issue here today  because  those  two
noble principles -  which  underpinned  that  noble  document,  the  Freedom
Charter - have not yet been effected.

At the heart of and underpinning this declaration was a firm  commitment  to
nonracialism in undoing the legacy of colonial rule in  our  country,  hence
the reverberating emphasis of  blacks  and  whites,  coloureds  and  Indians
throughout the Freedom Charter. It was that historic assembly of the  people
in Kliptown 47 years back that developed and adopted a document  called  the
Freedom Charter, a document which remains a living policy foundation of  our
people, our country and our movement, the ANC.

It is for this House, as we debate the  critical  challenges  of  integrated
and sustainable rural development  this  afternoon,  to  do  so  in  fitting
memory and dedication to the lives  of  generations  of  leadership  of  our
people who steered the drafting  of  the  Freedom  Charter.  These  are  the
generations  of  Albert  Luthuli,  Chief  Moroka,  Yusuf  Dadoo,  Prof  Z  K
Matthews, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo, Duma Nokwe and others. We owe  it  to
them  to  move  with  speed   and   courage   to   eradicate   poverty   and
underdevelopment  in  our  country,  amongst  the   rural   communities   in
particular.

We debate these critical issues after this august House has prioritised  the
question of integrated, sustainable rural development and urban  renewal  as
part of its ongoing oversight role in the past two  months.  We  were  doing
this, proceeding from the state of the nation address by  the  President  in
2001, when he identified 13 nodal  points  for  integrated  and  sustainable
rural development. Our task was to check the  extent  and  impact  of  these
identified projects on the lives of the ordinary masses of our people.

On the occasion of the state of the nation address in  2002,  the  President
of the country, the hon Thabo Mbeki,  made  the  following  remarks,  and  I
quote:
  As we push back the frontiers of poverty,  integrated  rural  development
  and urban renewal programmes assume critical importance. Work has started
  in  all  the  13  rural  nodes  identified  last  year,  with  integrated
  programmes  ranging  from  community  production  centres,   multipurpose
  community centres, social infrastructure projects and others  being  laid
  out. In the urban nodes, business plans have been finalised and a  number
  of projects have already being implemented.

Being  from  a  province  which  is  predominantly  rural,  with   attendant
socioeconmic problems associated with a rural setting, I rise to  attest  to
abject poverty that our people are subjected to on  a  day-to-day  basis  in
both the rural and urban areas.  With  poverty  and  underdevelopment  still
defining the lives of many of our people, I  rise  with  confidence  to  say
that our people have seen a life post-27 April 1994.  Unlike  before,  every
sunrise brings unto them a renewed sense of hope for a better  future.  They
are like a maturing organism that steadily begins to take charge of its  own
faith and destiny, keeping it firmly in its hands on a day-to-day basis.

More than 60% of the people in the Free State live in poverty. The  district
of Thabo Mofutsanyana, an identified rural node in my province,  is  a  good
testimony of a community in  transition  from  hopelessness  to  a  brighter
future. As part of the integrated and sustainable  development  initiatives,
there are 143 identified projects, with 16 prioritised  as  anchor  projects
with a committed amount of R85 480 000. Both  the  provincial  and  national
departments are funding these projects, with contributions from  parastatals
like Eskom.

Of significance is the 500 housing units built as  part  of  the  mitigation
plan for the families that were displaced by the disaster in 2001. The  area
where  these  houses  are  built  is  called  ``Disaster  Park'',  and   the
provincial department of housing  and  local  government  has  allocated  an
amount of R4 million for sewerage and sanitation in that area.

Through private sector investment and the contribution  of  the  Free  State
Development  Corporation,  a  new  shopping  centre  has  been  built,  thus
creating many permanent jobs for our people and enhancing  service  delivery
in that area. There are many projects like the construction  of  the  clinic
in Blue Gum Bush to cater for the people there, as  well  as  those  in  the
Disaster Park area. This means that the people no longer have to travel  for
more than 10 km to access health service.

To cater for the sporting and recreational needs of the community, a  sports
stadium has been built in the Blue Gum Bush, which  will  also  benefit  the
people at Disaster Park. The list is too long, with the little time that  we
have. Suffice to say that projects are unfolding  in  every  village  within
that node.

We have noted with appreciation, during the process of  consultation,  while
visiting the sites, the co-operation  of  our  traditional  leaders  in  all
these developmental initiatives, and we  call  on  the  other  provinces  to
follow the courage and spirit of  patriotism  that  has  been  displayed  by
traditional leaders in our province.

Like we said in 1994 and 1999 in  our  election  manifesto,  electrification
and the provision of water in the rural areas remain ongoing  priorities  of
the Government of the day in its delivery programme. More than  70%  of  our
people in Qwaqwa have access to both water and electricity.

Despite the major progress made and  the  inspiring  enthusiasm  with  which
different spheres of government are at work to push back  the  frontiers  of
poverty, there still remain critical challenges that need  to  be  addressed
as a matter of urgency. Key and critical  amongst  the  challenges  that  we
have identified are the following.

Firstly, there is a lack of  co-ordination  and  communication  amongst  the
different spheres of government, as  the  Minister  has  already  mentioned.
Secondly, there is a lack of capacity of the local  government  institutions
and structures to mobilise our people to  be  the  driving  forces  of  this
development initiatives.

Thirdly, there is a lack of a strategic approach in both the provincial  and
local governments to target special social sectors  like  women,  youth  and
people living with disabilities as beneficiaries of the  projects  that  are
unfolding. Fourthly, there is a lack of  capacity  of  local  government  in
monitoring and overseeing the projects.

I want to make an example around the issue of co-ordination. One can find  a
situation in Qwaqwa where a particular Government department -  let  me  say
it outright: the Department of Sport and Recreation - decides to pump  in  a
lot of resources to put an infrastructure  in  the  community,  without  any
consultation or joint planning with the local government.  That  means  that
the local government has not planned, both in terms of the budget and  other
related services, to cater for that.

When such a project is finished,  we  would  normally  call  people  to  the
ribbon-cutting ceremony - the work is now done! After  the  cutting  of  the
ribbon, what happens? That infrastructure collapses! Our people  would  then
be asked: ``What happened to the infrastructure?''

The local government would also say that they do  not  know  anything  about
that, as the Minister or the MEC ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Cllr D MASEMOLA (Salga): Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy Minister,  hon
members and special  delegates  of  provinces,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme is a Government  strategy
aimed  at  ensuring  integrated  rural  development  throughout  the  entire
country. It is intended to function in conjunction with  the  urban  renewal
programme, which aims to change township conditions.

In particular, the ISRDP's vision, as elaborated on in the strategy, is to:


  Attain  socially  cohesive  and  stable  rural  communities  with  viable
  institutions,  sustainable  economies  and  universal  access  to  social
  amenities, able to attract and retain skillful and  knowledgeable  people
  who are equipped to contribute to growth and development.

The programme's strategic objective is to ensure that by the year  2010  the
rural areas and  townships  of  our  country  will  have  attained  internal
capacity for integrated and sustainable development.  In  order  to  achieve
that, the ISRDP, in particular, moves  from  the  position  that  Government
should lead in the consolidation,  formulation,  implementation,  monitoring
and evaluation of well  co-ordinated  programmes  and  projects  which  will
ensure participation of all spheres of Government and civil society.

The great value that the ISRDP has added to  the  nodes  is  that,  for  the
first  time  in  the  history  of  our  country,  multisectoral   Government
departments, parastatals and other  organisations  are  co-operating  in  an
effort to address the rural development  backlogs  in  the  nodes.  This  is
significant because the interim integrated development planning process  was
less  successful  in  bringing  together  the  major  players  in  municipal
development across the country.

There  are,  certainly,  lessons  that  were  learned  with  regard  to  the
collective mobilisation of resources at our disposal  in  order  to  advance
development in our local areas. In line with the  political  consensus  that
visible and tangible progress should be shown in respect  of  the  ISRDP  by
January 2002,  an  extensive  consultative  process  was  embarked  upon  to
identify anchor projects. Approximately 137  projects  were  identified  and
packaged by municipalities  and  provinces,  and  thereby  was  announced  a
basket of services that would bring fundamental changes in the lives of  the
rural masses.

However, a number of lessons that emerged out of this  process  include  the
following. In some instances, some Government officials did not  necessarily
have the capacity and skills required  to  engage  constructively  with  our
municipalities. There are constraints  regarding,  in  some  instances,  the
sharing of information and that  affects  intersphere  planning.  Government
structures need to internalise and maintain the notion of  intergovernmental
integrated  development  planning  as  resolved  by  the   President's   Co-
ordinating Council. Therefore, we need to ensure that there  is  proper  co-
ordination between provinces regarding the cross-boundary rural  development
nodes. That needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, as well.

Despite the above lessons, concerted efforts need to be  made  in  order  to
ensure maximum benefit for rural  communities  and  township  residents  who
were identified within those particular nodes. There is, therefore,  a  need
for joint effort, especially by the interdepartmental task team  structures,
to  harness  both  human  and  financial  resources  in  order   to   ensure
socioeconomic sustainability of the anchor projects  and  development  plans
of all those nodes.

The premise which informs the management of both the ISRDP and URP  is  that
funds should be channelled from various existing sources  within  Government
to the relevant nodes. The understanding which underpins  this  position  is
that the ring-fencing  of  the  amounts  for  rural  development  and  urban
renewal is not necessarily a priority in that regard. However,  the  lessons
which emanate from the past few months suggest that that should be  reviewed
very  urgently  because  of  the  following   reasons.   All   rural   nodal
municipalities, without exception, face critical resource constraints.  That
is further aggravated by  the  fact  that  their  development  backlogs  and
challenges are the most challenging in the country. Government  departments,
in some instances, regarding the process of planning, are not in a  position
to quickly allocate  resources  or  redirect  their  funding  towards  those
particular plans.

It is clear that additional funds must be  made  available  to  address  the
funding difficulties that are currently  being  experienced.  Therefore,  we
pledge our support to the Department of Provincial and Local  Government  in
their efforts to  obtain  such  funding  from  the  national  fiscus.  Their
success in securing such funding will enable municipalities like  Sekhukhune
and others, who continuously succeed, to bring into existence systems  which
never existed in those municipalities, notwithstanding the  fact  that  they
never existed prior to the election of the year 2000.

Their continuous implementation of the  strategy  and  development  projects
does  account  for  the  impact  of  the  said  programmes.  The  Sekhukhune
municipality, in particular, as I speak in this House today,  has  succeeded
to move from being able to  pass  a  budget  of  R32  million  in  the  past
financial year to a budget of about R186 million this financial  year.  That
has shown a substantial growth in percentage, regarding the budget  of  that
municipality. Therefore, that accounts for  the  direct  implementation  and
the effect of the said programme.

Further, it must be  noted  that  significant  progress  has  been  made  in
establishing institutions for ISRDP implementation  both  at  political  and
technical levels and across  all  three  spheres  of  Government  to  drive,
manage and implement the programme. In the context of  that  programme,  the
following steps are worth noting. Firstly,  an  intergovernmental  relations
analysis that outlines key roles,  responsibilities  and  critical  entities
across all spheres has been  prepared  and  distributed.  A  core  group  of
Ministers has been assigned in pairs and as individuals to act as  political
champions  to  provinces  and  particular  municipalities.   Political   and
technical champions have been identified both  within  provinces  and  nodal
municipalities.  The  interdepartmental  task  team   structure   has   been
established at the national level to manage and co-ordinate  the  programme.
Provinces and nodes are at various stages of establishing similar  technical
bodies and structures. There is  continuous  mobilisation  of  stakeholders,
including the IDT, to ensure that the understanding of the contents  of  the
strategy does, indeed, filter to the population on the ground.

The majority of the nodes, as  we  speak,  have  already  established  nodal
delivery teams which are vehicles aimed at  ensuring  the  fast-tracking  of
planning, monitoring and implementation  of  these  two  strategies  ie  the
ISRDP and URP. In  all  nodes,  by  now,  the  planning  and  implementation
management support systems have been established, are  operational  and  are
able to guide those in management in the direction of  how  these  processes
and programmes need to be implemented.

The  IRSDP  is  intended  to  establish  the  best  possible  approach   and
methodology for integration and co-ordination of  Government  programmes  in
order to benefit rural communities,  given  the  basic  needs  and  economic
imperatives for local economic development. It is quite clear that there  is
a need for  continuous  integration  of  processes,  as  identified  by  the
programme, in order for us to maximise benefits for our  communities  as  we
have already started. Because of resource constraints within all spheres  of
Government, the expected high returns on investment by  private  sector  and
the high level of poverty among rural communities,  financial  resources  to
fund integrated rural villages and urban townships have tended to  be  short
in supply, given the backlogs history of our  country  in  those  areas,  in
particular. Therefore, the strategies to  maximise  and  continuously  focus
our energies by roping in the participation of major companies  to  redirect
their focus and energies into those programmes, remain  a  challenging  task
and a very important one.

In conclusion, the  process  of  identifying  anchor  projects  through  the
interim IDPs has been a most useful development in the integration  and  co-
ordination of programmes and joint  planning.  They  have  reached  exciting
proportions in the rural nodes. In order to sustain this momentum, there  is
a need for us to ensure that we continue to avail enough  resources  towards
the complete realisation of the vision of the strategy.

I would like to say that we wish the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government good luck in its collective responsibility. We  would  also  urge
both the Minister and the Deputy Minister, and officials of the  department,
to put much effort  and  energy  towards  the  total  realisation  of  these
strategies. [Applause.]

Mhlali-ngaphambili, ingxoxo-mpikiswano ngophuhliso  oluzinzileyo  kwiindawo,
ngakumbi, ezasemakhaya novuselelo kwiidolophu  yinto  esiyiqhwabela  izandla
leyo.  Le  ngxoxo-mpikiswano  iza  ngethuba  elihle  nelifanelekileyo,   kwa
nelichanekileyo, kuba kusele iintsuku  zintandathu  umhlaba  wonke  jikelele
ushukuxa lo mbandela apha eMzantsi Afrika.
Ziseliqela ke izinto ezicela umngeni, ngakumbi,  kwiphondo  leMpuma  Koloni,
apho kufuneka siwubhinqe  ube  mfutshane,  ukuba  uyamazi  unozitshotshwana,
ukuphucula impilo yabantu bakowethu. Ngenxa yezimpuphuma  zayizolo  nayizolo
elinye, awekho amanzi eMpuma Koloni. Kuza kuvele kungqale  izifo  kuba  siza
kuya  kusela  kulaa  manzi  ebezimpuphuma.  Kaloku,  abantu  kweliya  phondo
basasela kunye neehagu neenkomo ngenxa yokuba awakaphuhliswa  ngokupheleleyo
amanzi.

Umbandela wezeendlela unobuzaza nyani, kuba unxibelelwano kumaziko  eenkonzo
luyaqhawuka  ngenxa  yokungabikho  kweendlela.  Abantwana  bangakwazi  ukuya
ezikolweni, bangakwazi ukuya ezibhedlele,  ze  kuthi  xa  kujongwa  iziphumo
zebanga leshumi kuthiwe iMpuma  Koloni  ayenzanga  ngokwaneleyo.  Kulityalwe
into yokuba kwiinyanga ezintathu bekungekho zindlela.

Ukutyunjwa  kweendawo  ezihlelelekileyo  phaya  eMpuma   Koloni   ibingelilo
iphutha elenziwe ngokaZizi. Nguye yedwa uMongameli apha kweli hlabathi  othi
`mna ndimele abantu abangena nto'. Yiloo nto eye wabhengeza  kumhlaba  wonke
into  yokuba  `nalapho  ndandisakuzalwa  khona,   eMpuma   Koloni,   kukhona
uKhahlamba,  kukhona  iO  R  Tambo,  kukhona  iAlfred  Nzo,   kanti   ikhona
noMdantsane, kuzii`urban' ne `rural nodal points'.

Banoyolo abangahlaliyo kwiimbutho zabagxeki, ngoba  abana'  kulibona  izulu.
Kufuneka ke abaya abasenza saba kule meko  babenathi  ekwakheni  lo  Mzantsi
Afrika. Bangakhombi ngeminwe besithi eMpuma Koloni akukho  lulawulo,  akukho
phuhliso xa kanti  sasinamaphandle  ayengenziwanga  ngulo  Rhulumente  osele
etyathe umthwalo namhlanje. Wazithwal' izono yena okaMbeki.

Izithuthi  azikwazi  ukufikelela  ezibhedlele,  amayeza  angakwazi   ukufika
kuluntu, ze abantu bagule ke, ngakumbi abantu  abangondlekanga  ngokwaneleyo
ngenxa yento yokuba nemisebenzi ayikho.

Kulusizi into yokuba sibe siyathetha apha namhlanje  kule  ngxoxo-mpikiswano
kungekho  nomnye  umphathiswa  osuka  kumaphondo.  Abaphathiswa   bamaphondo
bekufanele into yokuba ngeli xesha banika ingxelo apha, yokuba sihambe  saza
kuma apha. Athi uMphathiswa  kazwe-lonke  `nantsi  ke  enye  indlela  yokuya
phambili'. Kodwa ndifumana thina maxhoba sithethathethana sodwa.  Ndithi  ke
kuMbexeshi omKhulu ojongene nale Ndlu maze ancede  into  yokuba  singathethi
sodwa abantu bekhona. Makuvakale xa sithethayo.

Ndenza isindululo  sokuba  kubanjwe  i-indaba  yeBhunga  LeSizwe  lamaPhondo
ezakubiza bonke abaphathiswa, eza kumbiza uSalga nabaphathiswa,  ze  sihlale
sixoxe malunga nokuba kwenzeke ntoni, siyaphi kwaye sisuka phi na.

Ngokumalunga nombandela  ojongene  neenkokeli  zemveli,  kamnandi,  ndibuya,
umoya  wam  uphezulu,  ndisuka  kwi`Women  on  Local  Government'.  Ibiphaya
ePitoli.  Besihleli  nomam'  uBotha  phaya,  kusithiwa   `Women   in   Local
Government, a Powerhouse  for  Transformation'.  Kodwa  ngenxa  yokuthabatha
ixesha into yokuba makugqityezelwe  imisebenzi  yeenkokeli  zemveli  kuhamba
kubekho ukhinxi xa kufika ekubeni amakhosikazi alawule, ngoba inkosi  ethile
iza kuthi `lo umhlaba ngowam'.  Awusayi  kwakha  zindlwana  zeRDP.  Loo  nto
imise inkcubeko nophuhliso kubantu  bakuthi.  Sithi  ke  kuMpathiswa  makabe
ngathi uyakhawulezisa, abe ngathi ubaleka okwe nkwenkwana, ngakumbi  ekubeni
ngubani kanye kanye inkokeli yemveli?  yenza  ntoni,  ngakumbi  kweli  xesha
esikulo? Ewe zikhona iprojekthi kodwa zihamba okomlilo weendiza, wena  wakhe
wawubona  umlilo  weendiza,  yeka  ispoki  sasentsomini,   ulozilozi   phaya

[We welcome the debate on sustainable development in rural  areas  and  that
on urban renewal. This debate comes at the right and appropriate  time,  six
days before the whole world deals with this issue here in South Africa.

There are still a number of  challenges,  especially  in  the  Eastern  Cape
where we have to roll up our sleeves in order to  improve  the  lot  of  our
people. As  a  result  of  the  floods  of  yesterday  and  the  day  before
yesterday, there is no water in the Eastern Cape. Diseases will  soon  break
out because we are going to drink the flood water. Indeed, people from  that
province still drink from the same sources as pigs and cattle,  because  the
water supply has not been fully developed yet.

The question of the lack of roads is a  serious  one  because  it  adversely
affects communication between the institutions of service.  Children  cannot
go to school and also cannot go to hospitals, and yet  when  matric  results
are released, people say that  the  Eastern  Cape  has  not  performed  well
enough, forgetting that for three months roads were inaccessible.

Identifying disadvantaged areas in the Eastern Cape was  not  a  mistake  on
the part of Zizi (the President). He is the only president in the world  who
says: ``I represent the needy.'' That is the reason  he  declared  municipal
areas at my birthplace, the Eastern Cape, such  as  Khahlamba,  O  R  Tambo,
Alfred Nzo, as well as Mdantsane, urban and rural nodal points.

"Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or  stand
in the way of the sinners, or sit in the seat of mockers." Those who put  us
in these circumstances should be with us in building  a  new  South  Africa.
They should stop pointing fingers, saying  that  the  Eastern  Cape  has  no
control and that there is a lack of development.   This  Government  has  to
shoulder the burden of  the  former  bantustans,  which  were  not  its  own
creation. All the burden is put on the shoulders of President Mbeki.

Transport cannot reach hospitals and medicines cannot reach the  people  and
consequently people get sick, particularly those who are malnourished  as  a
result of the lack of employment.

It is a pity that we take part in this debate today without  even  a  single
MEC from a province being present.  Provincial  MECs  were  supposed  to  be
here, giving an  account  of  where  things  stand.  The  national  Minister
usually says: ``Here is another way forward.'' But I find us,  the  victims,
negotiating on our own. I appeal to the Chief Whip of the Council to  ensure
that we do not speak in a void. We should be heard when we speak.

I propose  that  we  hold  an  indaba  involving  the  National  Council  of
Provinces, all Ministers and Salga, and talk about what is happening,  where
we are going and where we come from.

Concerning traditional leaders, I would like to say that fortunately I  came
back in high spirits from the Women on Local Government indaba in  Pretoria.
We were  there  with  Mama  Botha,  with  ``Women  in  Local  Government:  A
powerhouse for Transformation'' as the  theme.  Because  it  takes  time  to
resolve the question of the role of traditional leaders, we often  encounter
problems because a certain chief might say, ``This is my land. You will  not
build RDP houses here.'' That blocks  the  development  of  our  people.  We
appeal to the Minister to speed up the process, especially in resolving  the
question of who really is  a  traditional  leader  and  what  his  role  is,
particularly in modern times. Yes, there are projects, but they are few  and
far between.]

(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister,  and  the
honourable Council, today we are  discussing  a  critical  topic  -  working
together in finding strategies to  bring  about  development  in  rural  and
urban areas, and those areas that are close to towns.

We all know that people suffer indescribable poverty, and  the  solution  to
this will be the kind of development that  will  stimulate  economic  growth
and improve the health of people. The President of this country  is  serious
about  development.  There  are  areas  that  have  been   prioritised   for
development. Each province has been tasked with the  duty  of  checking  the
skills that are needed in developing the presidential nodal points.

Problems hindering the process of development  in  these  areas  are  roads,
which make it impossible to deliver the necessary  equipment.  Sometimes  it
is water, which needs to be drawn from rivers and dams, and electricity.

We need development initiatives that will benefit  communities,  not  things
that will soon disappear, but that which will sustain the  economy.  African
communities need to be trained and empowered with skills  that  will  enable
them to develop themselves so that there will be no people who are  affected
by poverty, which is the  cause  of  various  diseases.  Poverty  encourages
different types of crimes, and it hinders development. It is the number  one
enemy that needs to be fought throughout Africa.  It  is  because  of  these
conditions that we now have projects that are meant to fight poverty,  which
are called "oxoshindlala" in Zulu. In this campaign  to  fight  poverty,  we
are not looking at temporary measures, but we want poverty to  end  so  that
communities can develop and the  economy  improve;  communities  should  get
educated in order to create job opportunities and so that they are  able  to
have their own trades.

The end of poverty will also end there being  beggars  on  the  streets;  it
will bring electricity to many homes, clean water, plenty of food  from  the
fields and there will be economic development throughout Africa.]

We know that, in Africa as a whole,  half  the  number  of  people  live  in
absolute  poverty.  About  19  000  African  children  die  each  year  from
preventable diseases. About 75%  of  people  living  with  HIV/Aids  are  in
Africa. We hope that the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's  Development  will
boost expertise and capacity towards integrated strategic rural  development
and urban renewal. The World Summit on  Sustainable  Development,  which  is
going to take place in Gauteng, is a  privilege  and  a  golden  opportunity
towards achieving that goal. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, when one talks about delivery, some  people
think of a truck full of bags of mealies, getting moved around  the  streets
and getting off-loaded in front of their yards.
From 27 to 31 May a delegation from Limpopo visited some of the nodal  areas
which were declared by the President.  We  concentrated  on  two  districts,
Sekhukhune  and  Bohlabela.  We  were  accompanied  by  MPLs,   mayors   and
councillors. After a formal briefing by the MEC  for  local  government  and
the MEC for safety and security, we went to the  field  to  do  an  in  loco
inspection.

At Greater Sekhukhune we discovered that transformation  was  taking  place,
but at a very slow pace. Officials in  those  offices  do  not  reflect  the
demographics of that area, and we would like the department to do  something
about this. The district and municipal  councils  are  housed  in  the  same
offices. The district council is at the mercy of the municipal  council  for
equipment and other facilities.

My colleague has  touched  on  the  issue  of  the  projects  undertaken  at
Elandskraal, and I need not dwell too much on that. But this is one  success
story that we are proud of. I can only add that  we  saw  women  empowerment
with our  naked  eyes.  Those  women  at  Elandskraal  are  very  dedicated.
Unfortunately, funding is not enough  and  they  have  to  share  equipment,
which makes things very difficult for them.

We visited Tafelkop Centre for the Mentally  Disabled.  The  children  there
were housed in a change room of a local stadium.  It  is  pleasing  to  know
that they are now housed in a proper building, but there was a request  that
they be built more classrooms.

The Vergelegen Dam Water Supply Scheme is underway.  This  dam  supplies  no
less than 28 villages. It also supplies water to the  two  local  hospitals,
Jane Furse and St Ritas. Members will recall that Jane Furse made  headlines
when it went for four days without water.

An augmentation of this dam is now taking place to enable it to supply  more
water to the local communities. Even though the  dam's  capacity  is  68 000
kl, the water is not enough to cater for all the people in  that  area.  The
only available option would be to draw water from  the  Flag  Boshielo  Dam,
commonly known as the Arabie Dam. Members will recall that this  Arabie  Dam
is where a  local  young  boy  was  drowned  by  those  satanic,  abhorrent,
unreasonable and barbaric rugby players.

The  delegation  went  down  to  the  Bohlabela  district  in  the  Maruleng
municipality. The road from Trichardsdal to Sekororo is  being  tarred,  but
for only 5 km. This municipality experienced serious damage during the  year
2000 floods. Bridges were washed away by floods, roads were damaged,  houses
were destroyed and many people died. People will remember that the  body  of
a child who died during those floods  was  never  recovered.  We  are  still
mourning the death and disappearance of that child.

A dangerous bridge that  killed  many  people  in  the  area  is  now  fully
operational. Roads are being regravelled, but unfortunately  funds  are  not
enough to enable the municipality to do what is expected of it.

A reservoir is being  built  at  Sekororo.  After  its  completion,  we  are
hopeful that it will service not less than 15  villages.  According  to  the
mayor of that municipality, they still need more reservoirs to supply  water
to those communities. I know that the department  will  do  something  about
this.

The Hoedspruit airforce base is underutilised. There are empty  houses  that
are rotting in the complex. The municipality tried in vain to  make  use  of
those  facilities.  The  self-made  landlords  are  unkind,   irresponsible,
unreasonable, shapeless, unworkable and ugly. [Laughter.]  What  can  we  do
about those kinds of people? I know that the Minister will respond to that!

Bushbuckridge is one of the areas that were affected by the  floods  in  the
year 2000. The conditions of our roads leave much to be desired, but  thanks
God, something is being done now. Graders  are  regravelling  and  levelling
those roads, but it is clear that some of those roads need to be tarred.

We told the mayor and his  councillors  that  this  department  is  in  good
hands. We said the Minister and his Deputy are not  like  the  landlords  in
Hoedspruit. They are responsible and kind, and when people make  a  request,
they listen. Just wait and see!

There are communities, unfortunately, who  still  rely  on  water  from  the
river. Government departments are hard at work trying to deal with this.  It
is just unfortunate that there  was  a  serious  backlog  in  terms  of  the
provision of social services, but as I speak, there are  projects  that  are
underway.

The multipurpose centre at Kasteel came  at  the  right  time.  It  is  well
located, accessible and beautiful. This will go a long way  in  making  sure
that people get service next to where they live.

There are some departments that are still operating  according  to  the  old
demarcation. They are not yet aligned to the new  demarcation.  Examples  of
these are Agriculture, Land Affairs,  Education,  Safety  and  Security  and
others. One would find a department in one  district  reporting  to  another
district which is about 200 km from where they are.

The mayor and his councillors requested us to convey  to  the  Minister  and
his Deputy that they would not mind if recreational  facilities  were  built
for them in that area.

Again, there is a need for further  improvement  in  communication  and  co-
ordination among the three spheres of Government. I wonder if there is  some
truth in the saying that in whatever one is doing, once one  discovers  that
he or she has been going in  the  wrong  direction,  one  should  just  turn
around and take the right direction.

Let the good work continue! I have spoken. [Applause.]

The CHIEF  WHIP  OF  THE  COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  Deputy
Minister, you might have heard the hon Kolweni speak about  rural  women  in
such high and lofty terms, and  quite  correctly  so.  I  think  he  did  so
because he, like many of us who accompanied  him  to  the  remote  areas  of
Kgalagadi, was quite inspired by the courage, the resilience  and  the  will
of the women to make a difference to their lives.

We learnt a lot about women, their character, their strength, and about  the
will of the people to take hold of and  seize  the  opportunities  that  are
presented to them by Government to change  their  lives.  These  experiences
were quite enriching, and I would encourage  members  who  found  that  they
were busy with other engagements to join such delegations.

Amongst other things, we learnt that there is a  difference  between  basadi
[women] and bomme [mothers] in  terms  of  linguistic  arrangements  or  the
language construction. We learned  about  dipudi  [goats],  kgomo  [a  cow],
ditona [big  ones]  and  dinnyane  [small  ones].  [Interjections.]  I  also
learned a little bit more about the indigenous languages, which I  felt  was
quite an enriching experience.
I have also noticed - and I urge the Minister to take note of  this  -  that
we have taken  steps  from  Kliptown,  where  the  assembly  of  the  people
gathered in 1955, to Cape  Town,  where  we  sit  within  the  precincts  of
Parliament, and thereafter to Umtata, where Parliament went to  the  people.
And now, in this instance, we had delegations of Parliament visiting the  21
nodes set aside by the President in  the  nine  provinces  for  purposes  of
socioeconomic transformation, and to indicate the commitment of the  ANC  in
Government to change the quality of the lives of our people.

When we look at the presidential nodes that have been  determined,  we  find
that they have been described in some instances as anchor projects,  and  in
other instances as an intervention to eliminate poverty, or a  developmental
trajectory to ensure that there is sustainable development.

We must look at these nodes  against  the  background  of  the  multifaceted
challenges that we face as a nation. We must do so also in  the  context  of
the fact that we have a constitutional arrangement which compels and  impels
us towards co-operative and co-ordinated governance. I think  what  we  have
witnessed was really an exercise in determining to what extent the level  of
co-operation is working or not working, to what extent it can  be  improved,
and to what extent there  would  be  horizontal  interaction,  as  has  been
indicated by the hon the Minister. What are the future  challenges  we  have
to look at?

I would like to concentrate on a few aspects of a general nature, given  the
fact that the people  from  the  different  provinces,  with  their  diverse
development, have already spoken. Amongst the challenges we face, given  our
experience there, are certain key political questions that we  have  to  ask
ourselves. For  example,  where  there  are  cross-boundary  municipalities,
there are certain definite choices that we have to make politically.

Firstly, we have to ask whether such municipalities do  work.  Secondly,  if
they do work, is the level of horizontal interaction, both  politically  and
administratively, adequate enough in its present conjuncture to ensure  that
these developments and programmes are successful and efficient?

Thirdly, should we again look at or redesign the boundaries  of  either  our
municipalities or our district councils to ensure that  they  are  efficient
enough? And if we do not do that, the alternative  is  to  ask  who  in  the
provinces should politically manage such an undertaking.

These are key and critical political questions, and I think  our  nation  is
sufficiently developed to understand  that  it  does  not  matter  in  which
province or district one  is  located,  as  long  as  there  is  social  and
economic  transformation  taking  place  which  affects   one's   lifestyle,
improves one's quality of  life  and  gives  one  access  to  opportunities,
education and a better life. I think those are the key,  critical  questions
that we as a nation have to face and answer, in  the  context  of  the  fact
that we in the National Council of Provinces are here  to  speak  about  and
promote the interests of the various provinces.

The other issue that we have to  look  at  quite  candidly  and  frankly  is
whether there is sufficient grasp of the  integrated  development  plan.  We
are aware of and commend Government  and  the  Ministry  for  carefully  and
meticulously linking the presidential  nodes  to  the  IDPs.  The  issue  is
whether there is sufficient understanding of this nexus; and  whether  there
is  adequate  ownership  on  the  part  of  local  government  where   these
particular projects are located, to ensure that they are sustained.

This is the example that was given by Mr Setona: it  is  not  sufficient  to
put up an infrastructure if there is no discussion as to who  owns  it,  who
is going to monitor it, who is going to promote it and who is going to  take
ownership of the property. So, in other words, the  developments  that  take
place in terms of social and economic  infrastructure  must  belong  to  the
people. That is where the assembly of  the  people  is  and  that  is  where
ownership should take place.

However, we should qualify this to say that the  challenges  of  our  people
and of governments at all levels are quite enormous. Whilst we have  a  much
more  structured  and  sustained  control  at  the  level  of  national  and
provincial government, at local government  we  have  just  gone  through  a
phase of realignment with new  geographical  boundaries,  newly  constituted
councils and new challenges. In the light of this, one now has to marry  the
important vehicle of infrastructural development  through  the  presidential
nodes, to ensure that it occurs efficiently.

So given all these factors, the  reality  of  this  inventive  and  creative
approach by Government is that all three spheres co-operate to  ensure  that
appropriate support is provided,  from  national  and  provincial  to  local
government. This partnership - which includes not only the three spheres  of
Government, but community-based organisations, NGOs and religious leaders  -
ensures that transformation takes place at the behest of the people of  this
country, and is in fact a very creative and  responsive  challenge  to  this
nation. We believe that Government has to be commended for that.

The fact that the hon the Minister  has  heard  people  from  all  political
parties speak  about  the  presidential  nodes  in  one  voice  is  a  clear
indication that Government is on track. The Minister would have  immediately
noticed that when Mrs Gouws, Mr Matthee or  Mrs  Vilakazi  spoke,  they  all
spoke positively about this development, because when they  physically  went
out to see those places with their own eyes, they realised that there  is  a
difference, that there is hope, that there are challenges,  but  that  those
challenges are being addressed.

The fact is that there is a collective realisation that these  projects  are
not the responsibility of champions only at the level of  local  government:
they  occur  through  the  participation  and  co-operation  of   provincial
governments and the national Government.

The other area that one has to look at is the role that ward committees  can
play, particularly at the level of urban development. If there are going  to
be linkages, then these must be sought through public popular  participation
where the IDPs and  the  budgets  are  engaged.  Representatives  must  also
engage with communities at that particular level.

What is important to note is the kind of niche that  this  House  has  found
for itself, notwithstanding its sophisticated gadgetry  and  instruments  on
the panels. The Minister was really surprised when  he  looked  at  it,  and
said: ``Please teach me how this works when I come here next time.''

We have learnt that we have to listen to the voices of the people.  I  think
Umtata has been an example of that, where the overwhelming majority  of  the
people who were there said: ``Parliament has come  here  to  hear  what  our
grievances are.'' Indeed, we have listened to their grievances.

I wish to inform the hon the Minister that between the  9th  and  the  13th,
this House is going to the nine provinces, amongst other things to  look  at
integrated  development  plans  at  the  level  of  local   government,   ie
municipalities  and  district  councils,  and  the  kind  of  oversight  the
provinces have over that particular process. We  are  looking,  courtesy  of
Dorothy Mahlangu, the chairperson of the finance committee, at  the  outcome
of provincial budgets, ie how they affect provincial and local governments.

Each one of these members in this House would be going to  their  respective
provinces to enlighten them  and  share  that  particular  information  with
them. We are going to ensure that we discuss and  have  public  hearings  on
the Disaster Management Bill, not only at the legislatures, but at  district
councils in the various provinces, so that municipalities  and  stakeholders
from  all  the  different  parts  of  the  country  could  be  part  of  the
participatory democracy that we intend to promote.

These are small, bold but steady steps towards  what  the  assembly  of  the
people has determined, ie that the people shall  govern,  the  people  shall
influence and shape the people-centred and people-driven democracy  that  we
cherish. This is the kind of ethos that we have in mind when we  talk  about
the presidential nodes. We are saying to communities:  ``Be  creative,  take
ownership of this opportunity, seize it.''

I cannot but express the gratitude of this House to the  hon  the  Minister,
and in particular the hon  the  Deputy  Minister  and  the  department,  for
providing us with a wealth and an abundance of information  which  made  the
task - and I differ with the hon Gouws here - of each delegation very easy.

An HON MEMBER: She does not listen!

The CHIEF WHIP OF COUNCIL: She does  not  listen,  perhaps.  But  what  each
delegation received was the framework within which Government is  operating.
It received details of all the projects  that  will  be  undertaken  in  the
various provinces, so that when they go out there, they can,  in  fact,  see
that it is happening.

Talking of which, I have physically been to ... What is  the  name  of  that
place in Kgalagadi?

An HON MEMBER: Bredel!

The CHIEF WHIP OF COUNCIL: Bredel! I have been  there.  I  have  seen  those
sheep - and I wish the journalists were here. I  have  seen  the  women.  We
have the whole thing on film. We have seen them. We now know more about  the
grazing habits of the boerbok. Those are the goats  that  are  being  looked
after by women. Here is a good example where, in  a  far  and  remote  area,
women are given the opportunity to take up the cudgels of  the  economy,  to
ensure that there is  local  economic  development  that  can  change  their
lives.

I must thank all the members of the delegation who  have  gone  out  to  the
provinces. We have, indeed, made a point of visiting the MECs when  we  went
to the provinces, in order to  keep  them  informed  about  development.  We
understand that there has been  some  error  in  communication,  and  we  do
believe that the next time we come here we will  be  discussing  the  matter
further.

In conclusion, I would like to say that this  House  will  be  looking  more
closely at the report on infrastructural development as it affects  all  the
provinces and local government, because  the  Treasury  has  indicated  that
such reports are going to be made available. We would use those as  precious
instruments to determine to what extent  Government  is  succeeding  in  its
path to making a difference in the lives of our people. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR  PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson  and  hon
members, allow  me  to  commend  the  permanent  members  of  the  NCOP  who
undertook visits to the nodal municipalities. Clearly this was an  important
learning  experience:  members  came  back  and  compiled  a  report   which
contained many useful insights. We are going to look  at  that  report  very
closely, so that we can take on board the insights that it  contains  as  we
improve our implementation strategies.

The lessons which derive from the initiative that was taken by  hon  members
need to be absorbed, but quite clearly, there is also a need  for  the  NCOP
to consider instituting a programme for members with learning  disabilities.
I  think  Mrs  Gouws  distinguishes  herself  as  a  candidate  for  such  a
programme! [Laughter.] [Applause.].

She indicated to the House - after quoting what I said  to  the  President's
Co-ordinating Council in October 2001 - that we wanted to make sure that  by
the beginning of 2002 there would be demonstrable progress.  She  says  that
when the teams went out to the provinces, they had no guidelines as to  what
to look for. If that was true, then she cannot blame the people in the  know
for the fact that she saw nothing.

Perhaps what I need to point out is that a month after we made a  commitment
to the President's Co-ordinating Council, 125 projects  worth  R3,7  billion
were identified, just in the case of the rural  the  development  programme.
In the case of  the  Urban  Renewal  Programme,  110  anchor  projects  were
identified as an initial set of projects, and more than  64%  of  these  are
already underway from the point of view of implementation. Perhaps when  one
goes out to access progress, one needs to understand  the  base  from  which
one is starting.

The hon member Kgoali spoke about Alexandra township, which  happens  to  be
an area that I knew even before it was a designated  node.  I  was  born  in
Alexandra, so it did not have to be a designated node for me  to  visit  it.
However, the point I  want  to  make  is  that,  since  this  programme  was
initiated, there have been a lot of improvements. One of  them  -  and  this
may sound trivial - is the distribution of refuse  bins  in  Alexandra.  Now
this is a facility which is taken  for  granted  in  Sandton,  therefore  if
Sandtonians see refuse bins in Alexandra, they  would  say  that  they  have
seen no progress.

Take the case of Kgalagadi, where those members who  went  there  saw  black
women involved in farming projects.  This  is  of  particular  significance,
bearing in mind  that  August  is  the  month  in  which  we  focus  on  the
emancipation of women. What some members may not have seen in Kgalagadi,  is
what one journalist from a Johannesburg daily newspaper also  did  not  see:
he visited Kgalagadi after we had made our media briefing and  thought  that
the involvement of women in farming projects was insignificant.

The importance of the involvement of women in farming projects lies  in  the
fact that an initiative has been taken  to  ensure  that  women,  especially
black women, feature prominently in the production process. Furthermore,  an
area like Kgalagadi, which may not feature in many of the maps that some  of
our urban-based hon members have in their  homes,  is  for  the  first  time
being brought into the production process. We are  not  only  extending  the
geographic base of production, but also changing social relations  which  in
the  past  confined  women  to  those  sectors  of  the  economy  which  are
unrewarding.

Also, the fact that women are involved in production  improves  the  overall
productivity levels of our economy. It also enhances the growth rate of  the
economy, quite apart from taking this important section of  our  population,
rural women, from the depths of poverty to which they were consigned by  the
old dispensation.

I am saying that perhaps in future when we go out, we should make sure  that
we spend some time doing a drill around the guidelines on what to look  for.
That is because if people go out not knowing what to look  for,  that  is  a
fruitless expenditure by the National Council of Provinces.

However, the majority of speakers  have  shared  with  us  useful  insights,
which means that their visits to the provinces and the nodal  municipalities
were fruitful in so far as  it  enhanced  their  own  understanding  of  the
challenges on the ground. This will also enable members to give us  feedback
in such a way that we should be in a position to  collectively  improve  the
efforts that we must keep on making, both in the rural and urban  nodes.  We
have also taken note of the members'  impending  initiatives,  and  we  hope
that,  once  more,  all  of  us  will  learn  valuable  lessons  from  those
experiences. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  We  take  this
opportunity to thank the hon the Minister for engaging this  House  in  this
lively debate. We  look  forward  to  more  interaction  with  the  hon  the
Minister, because his department is a source of delivery.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 16.30.
