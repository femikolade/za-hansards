                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms H M MPAKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a protest march organised by youth organisations linked to
       the Inkatha Freedom Party, the United Democratic Movement and the Pan
       Africanist Congress on 5  August  2002  in  Johannesburg  ended  with
       looting of shops and street vendors in the city centre;


  (2) further notes a reported incident of a woman who was dragged  out  of
       her car and raped near Nancefield train station by a group of men who
       were attending this march;


  (3) condemns these criminal acts; and


  (4) calls on -


       (a)  the leadership of the IFP, UDM and PAC  to  inculcate  in  their
           members  a  culture  of  responsible  citizenry   and   peaceful
           political protest; and


       (b)  the people to work with the  police  in  ensuring  that  justice
           takes its cause.

[Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its disbelief at the fact that  President  Mbeki  continues
       worrying about fixing the problems  of  the  Middle  East  and  other
       hotspots in Africa and the world while ignoring the human tragedy  in
       Zimbabwe;


  (2) acknowledges that Mr Robert Mugabe's policy regarding  white  farmers
       is racist and that every commercial farmer who leaves, leaves  behind
       hundreds of fellow Zimbabweans without  work  and  thousands  without
       food; and


  (3) recognises that, cumulatively, millions of Zimbabweans are likely  to
       die of starvation and that their fate will have been determined by Mr
       Mugabe and his silent friends like President Mbeki.

[Applause.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Cape Town police have put out an ``all points alert''  for
       Thando ``Ayanda'' Maloti, whom they have described as the most wanted
       man in the Western Cape;


  (2) further notes that Maloti and his gang can  allegedly  be  linked  to
       several armed robberies and a spate of attacks on policemen; and


  (3) urges the community to assist the police with information that  could
       lead to the arrest of Maloti and his gang.

Mr M S BOOI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  ANC MPs, MPLs and volunteers distributed one million oranges and
           almost one million litres  of  milk  to  flood  victims  in  the
           township areas of Gugulethu, Khayelitsha,  Crossroads  and  KTC;
           and


       (b)  this initiative is part of efforts by the ANC to alleviate  some
           of the hardships experienced by the people in the townships; and


  (2) commends these volunteers for the sterling work  they  have  done  in
       making  life  manageable  to  victims  of  floods  in  the   informal
       settlements of the Western Cape.

[Applause.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the unheroic action of a South African spectator,  who  tackled
       the international  rugby  referee,  Dave  McHugh,  during  the  match
       between New Zealand and South Africa on Saturday;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  there is a growing tendency among spectators to  behave  poorly,
           not only at international sporting events,  but  also  at  local
           sporting events - especially rugby and soccer matches;


       (b)  the New NP condemns this type of behaviour and believes  it  can
           be prevented by increasing security and by  implementing  better
           measures to put a stop to alcohol abuse at sporting events; and


       (c)  isolated incidents like these reflect  badly  on  South  African
           spectators who are true to  the  spirit  of  sport  and  who  do
           justice to our sportsmen and sportswomen.

Mrs N C NKABINDE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I  will  move  on
behalf of the UDM at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) concurs that it is the responsibility of each and every South African
       to contribute towards the fight against HIV/Aids;


  (2) in light of the massive economic  impact  that  HIV/Aids  will  have,
       welcomes the efforts of a growing number of South African  employers,
       De Beers being the latest, that are actively addressing the pandemic,
       even to the extent of subsidising Aids treatment for their employees;


  (3) salutes all those South  Africans  and  private  companies  who  have
       committed themselves to actively participate in the fight against the
       HIV/Aids pandemic; and


  (4) calls on Government, as the largest employer, to  do  the  honourable
       and morally  correct  thing  by  following  suit  and  providing  its
       employees with the necessary assistance and treatment for HIV/Aids.

Mr A MLANGENI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the President of Cuba, Comrade Fidel Castro, turned 76 today  on
           13 August 2002;


       (b)  Comrade Castro has dedicated his  life  to  fighting  capitalist
           exploitation;


       (c)  the people of Cuba under the leadership of Comrade ...

[Interjections.] Shut up, please man!

The SPEAKER:Order!

Mr A MLANGENI: Just shut up! Sorry, Madam Speaker.
The SPEAKER: You are losing time, hon member.

Mr A MLANGENI:


       (c)  the people of Cuba under the leadership of Comrade Fidel  Castro
           have  made  immeasurable  sacrifices  in   the   struggles   for
           liberation and economic emancipation in Africa; and


       (d)  they have played a central role in defending the  gains  of  the
           revolution of the people of Angola; and


  (2) salutes Comrade Castro on his 76th birthday, and  on  behalf  of  the
       people of South Africa says: Long live Comrade Fidel! Long  live  the
       people of Cuba! Long live!

[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! The PAC, do you have a Notice of Motion?

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move
that this House ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Just a moment, I called the PAC.  [Interjections.]  Next
week is crossing-the-floor time, not now.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: They apparently are not in the House any more, Madam.

The SPEAKER: No they are, please proceed.

Dr S E M PHEKO: There is a bit of noise, Madam, we could not hear.

I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day  of  the  House  I  shall
move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the PAC is disturbed at the media reports that our country
       has been selling major  weapons,  including  attack  helicopters,  to
       countries such as Rwanda, India, Pakistan and Angola;
  (2) observes that these countries have been at war  for  many  years  and
       that the arms they are purchasing are not for self-defence alone;


  (3) affirms that -


       (a)  our country as a member of the  United  Nations  is  obliged  to
           preserve peace in the world; and


       (b)  South Africa as chairperson of the newly formed  African  Union,
           which is charged with promoting peace, stability and security in
           Africa, contradicts the AU policy and South Africa's own foreign
           policy by selling arms to warring nations; and


  (4) demands that if the reports about sales of arms are true, these sales
       be ended forthwith before they  tarnish  the  image  of  the  country
       irreparably.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, I believe that Cabinet time is on  Wednesdays  and
Cabinet Ministers should not be conducting their  meetings  in  this  House.
[Interjections.] Neither should hon members.
You may now speak, on behalf of your own party.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Thank you, Madam Speaker.

I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day  of  the  House  I  shall
move:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns the heartless,  unconstitutional,  undemocratic  and  racist
       actions of President Robert Mugabe  in  his  persistent  demand  that
       white farmers leave the land that they legitimately own;


  (2) recognises that his actions contribute to  increasing  political  and
       economic instability  in  the  Southern  African  region,  condemning
       millions to death by starvation; and


  (3) calls on President Mbeki not to leave it to the Commonwealth  and  to
       the European Union to do what South  Africa  and  the  African  Union
       should be doing in condemning Mr Mugabe and his despotic actions.

[Applause.]

Mr B MTHEMBU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)   black  members  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  in   Standerton,
           Mpumalanga, claimed that they have been sidelined by their white
           colleagues in Mpumalanga; and


       (b)  their white colleagues told their black counterparts  they  have
           their own executive committee in town  and  instructed  them  to
           form their own executive in the nearby township;


  (2) believes that this reflects racial  divisions  and  racist  practices
       within the Democratic Alliance; and


  (3) calls on the Leader of the Democratic Alliance,  hon  Tony  Leon,  to
       work towards eradicating the evil of racism within the ranks  of  the
       DA.

[Applause.]

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a deposit slip was sent to the  municipal  manager  of  Nketoana
           Council confirming that money  was  paid  into  the  ANC's  bank
           account by a company involved in various projects in the Eastern
           Free State;


       (b)  this is irregular since municipal managers should  be  impartial
           and nonpartisan; and


       (c)  this transaction raises questions  around  the  corrupt  use  of
           municipal contracts to generate funds for the ANC; and


  (2) therefore calls on the ANC to explain what this money was for and why
       the municipal manager was involved in this transaction.

Mr M S SIBIYA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that according to  the  Endangered  Wildlife  Trust  (EWT)  pet
       poisoning, especially of dogs, is linked to organised crime;


  (2) further notes that  criminals  break  into  houses  after  they  have
       poisoned and killed the dogs;


  (3) acknowledges that the EWT will ask pet  owners  to  take  part  in  a
       national campaign to determine the scope of the problem; and
  (4) urges all pet owners to co-operate with the EWT in their campaign  to
       fight crime.

Ms D M MOROBI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Scorpions unit arrested:


       (a)  the Van Dyk family from Vereeniging and laid fraud charges  over
           a pyramid scheme that handled R980 million on 23 July 2002;


       (b)  members of the  Diablo  164  Trade  Investment  which  defrauded
           members of the public of more than R9 million; and


       (c)  a man who allegedly posed as an advocate to  milk  ``investors''
           in the Eastern and Western Cape of at  least  R3  million  in  a
           predawn raid on 7 August 2002;


  (2) commends the work done by the Scorpions unit; and


  (3) calls on the people of South Africa to work tirelessly towards  moral
       regeneration in our society.

[Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Geagte Speaker, ek gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag van die Huis sal voorstel namens die Nuwe NP:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van die jongste  onthullings  voor  die  Desai-kommissie,
       naamlik dat die Leier van die  Opposisie  na  bewering  een  van  die
       trustees van 'n buitelandse trust sou word, waardeur geld van oorsese
       skenkers   vir   die   DA   na   Suid-Afrika   gebring    sou    word
       [Tussenwerpsels.];


  (2) meen dit is na aanleiding van hierdie  bekendmaking  noodsaaklik  dat
       die Leier van die Opposisie nou oop kaarte speel  en  die  mense  van
       Suid-Afrika  in   sy   vertroue   neem   met   betrekking   tot   die
       befondingskandaal van die DA; en


  (3) glo dat die agb Leon as Leier van die Opposisie  en  die  DP/DA  moet
       bedank totdat hierdie aangeleentheid opgeklaar is.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Hon Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the latest revelations before the Desai commission, namely that
       the Leader of the Opposition was allegedly to have become one of  the
       trustees of an offshore trust, by way of which money for the DA  from
       overseas donors would be brought to South Africa;


  (2) is of the opinion that, following this disclosure,  it  is  essential
       that the Leader of the Opposition now puts his cards on the table and
       takes the people of South Africa into his confidence with  regard  to
       the funding scandal of the DA; and


  (3) believes that the hon Leon should resign as Leader of the  Opposition
       and the DP/DA until this matter has been resolved.

[Applause.]]

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the UDM at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Transnet has been in  the  spotlight  regarding  corporate
       governance since the Coleman Andrew saga broke;


  (2) acknowledges that it is the South African taxpayers and  citizens  at
       whose expense corporate governance breaches occur;


  (3) in light of the above condemns the light punishment  that  was  meted
       out to senior Spoornet officials Messrs Jakavula  and  Vilakazi,  who
       have been demoted even though Transnet's CEO  has  acknowledged  that
       they committed ``dismissible offences''; and


  (4) urges the Government to ensure that corruption  is  punished  without
       fear or favour, to send out the message loud and clear that no matter
       what your position in society, deceit  and  dishonesty  will  not  be
       tolerated.

[Applause.]

                         CELEBRATIONS OF WOMEN'S DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I hereby  move  without
notice: That the House -


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -
       (a)  National Women's Day was celebrated through the reburial of  the
           remains of Sarah Baartman in Hankey, Eastern Cape; and


       (b)  the other key highlights of these celebrations were a  march  to
           the Union Buildings by women and various rallies in other  areas
           to highlight women's issues;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)   the  significance  of  these  and   many   other   celebrations
           highlighted the hardships that women had to suffer as  a  result
           of colonialism, racim and sexism; and


       (b)  the celebrations of National Women's Day  also  highlighted  the
           Government's  political  programme  of   working   towards   the
           restoration of the dignity of women, and in so doing,  executing
           an important task of working  towards  the  realisation  of  the
           emancipation of women as part of a broader struggle to roll back
           the frontiers of poverty; and
  (3) commends those patriots, men and women of our country,  who  attended
       the National Women's Day activities throughout the country  and  thus
       showed their unwavering commitment to women's emancipation.

Motion agreed to.

                       CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR ATHLETES

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I hereby  move  without
notice: That the House -


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  South African athletes won most of the gold  medals  during  the
           13th African Athletics Championships, which ended  on  Saturday,
           10 August, in Tunis, Tunisia;


       (b)  this success follows immediately on the best performance by  our
           athletics team  in  the  Commonwealth  Games  held  recently  in
           Manchester, England;


       (c)  Gold medallists like Mbulelo Malaudzi, Shaun Bownes  and  others
           recently gave memorable  performances  during  the  Commonwealth
           Games; and


       (d)  the achievements of the heroic swimmers Natalie du Toit; and


  (2) congratulates our athletics team on their recent victories; and


  (3) commends Athletics South Africa for a job well done.

Motion agreed to.

     DEBATE ON COMMITTEE REPORTS ON JOINT INVESTIGATION REPORT INTO THE
                   STRATEGIC DEFENCE PROCUREMENT PACKAGES

The SPEAKER: Hon members, before the debate commences, I wish to remind  all
of you that there are specific fraud cases that  are  currently  before  the
courts referring to the procurement of the arms. Members are  reminded  that
you should not refer in the debate to the merits or detail of any  of  those
cases.

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, hon members, ladies and  gentlemen.  When  the
reports were before the committee, the committee looked  at  them  and  made
our reports. Allow me just to then take a few minutes to go back.  When  the
then Minister of Defence, Mr Joe Modise, approached Parliament in  1995  for
its approval to  acquire  Spanish  ships,  Parliament  refused.  It  refused
because it said that it did  not  understand  why  South  Africa  should  be
acquiring ships without any plan, without the people of South Africa  having
expressed themselves on the needs of the Defence Force. This started  us  on
the road to the writing of the White Paper on Defence  and  eventually  onto
the Defence Review process.

Let me quickly go back to the issues we agreed to as  this  House,  when  we
were adopting the White Paper on Defence in 1996. We  agreed  that  security
shall now - and I stress now - be so primarily through the efforts  to  meet
political, economic, social and cultural rights and needs of South  Africa's
people and through efforts to promote  and  maintain  regional  security  in
Southern Africa.

We also agreed that South Africa would pursue peaceful relations with  other
states and seek a  high  level  of  political,  economic  and  military  co-
operation within Southern Africa. We agreed that  the  SANDF  shall  have  a
primarily  defensive  orientation  function  and  be  fully  subordinate  to
Parliament and the executive. We  agreed  on  force  levels,  armaments  and
military expenditure and that these shall be determined  by  defence  policy
derived from the analysis of the internal and external environment. We  also
agreed  that  the  SANDF  shall  be  a  balanced,  modern,  affordable   and
technologically advanced military  force  capable  of  executing  its  tasks
efficiently and effectively.

Finally, we agreed that  the  SANDF  shall  respect  human  rights  and  the
democratic processes and operate within the parameters of the  Constitution,
domestic law,  international  laws  and  conventions.  These  principles  we
agreed to when we adopted the White Paper. These  principles  were  reviewed
and elaborated on two years later when as this House again  we  adopted  the
comprehensive Defence Review. This process was a deliberate break  with  the
apartheid past, with the ethos  of  the  past  and  with  the  old  military
culture. Women, pacifists, rural and urban people, industrialists,  experts,
illiterates, churchgoers, the executive  and  Parliament  had  debated,  had
consulted and had spoken about what South Africa's defence needs should be.

The White Paper had thus determined the roles, the functions,  the  posture,
the doctrine, the design, the equipment and the  budgetary  implications  of
the South Africa Defence Force. Parliament, through its defence  committees,
had received an audit and had inspected some  of  the  equipment  which  the
SANDF had. Parliament, through  its  defence  committees,  had  debated  and
agreed upon the size, the posture and the equipment. We had  agreed  on  the
right to self-defence and deterrence. We had agreed that  we  would  not  be
threatening to our neighbours, but that we would also have the right to pre-
emptive action, should the need arise. We had agreed that,  where  possible,
our mobile and offensive forces would be drawn away  from  the  borders  and
deeper into our countries so that we would not seem  to  be  threatening  to
our  neighbours.  We  agreed  that  such  moves  would  contribute   towards
confidence building. We  never  said  that  South  Africa  would  not  equip
herself for effective, defensive and pre-emptive roles.
We also acknowledge that our region  has  not  been  known  for  everlasting
peace. We accepted that we had no choice but to be  part  of  the  regional,
humanitarian and disaster management. We agreed that South Africa needed  to
develop and maintain core defense capabilities, even though we had no  enemy
in the foreseeable future. The events of September 11 clearly show  that  we
were not wrong when we anticipated, and I quote from page 15 of the  Defence
Review,  ``that  future  enemies  will  have   sophisticated   weapons   and
systems''. When South  Africa  therefore  adopted  the  defence  design  and
posture, it would have been very  irresponsible  of  the  executive  not  to
equip as per the envisaged tasks as outlined in chapter  8  of  the  Defence
Review.

Should Parliament have taken a closer interest in the  acquisition  process?
With hindsight, yes. At the  time,  Parliament  had  satisfied  itself  that
there was a need to equip the Defence Force. It had debated on the types  of
equipment. It had been assured of the  structures  which  would  carry  this
out. It had been assured that  Armscor  and  the  Department  of  Trade  and
Industry had the required experience and  expertise.  It  had  been  assured
that the policy was adequate and existed. It had been assured  that  special
structures had been put in place. As the joint investigations team's  report
now shows, this acquisition was the first that  South  Africa  was  entering
into  since  the  democratic  elections  in  1994,  and  the  policies   and
structures which were obtained were not adequate to carry out  this  matter.
We need to go back to this.

We need to look at upgrading policy as per our recommendations. We  need  to
make sure that in the future the inadequate control which has been  revealed
by this report does not come back to us. We  need  to  make  sure  that  the
paper trail within the Department of Defence and Armscor is visible and  can
be followed through. We need to make sure that  the  task  group  which  has
been tasked with the restructuring of Armscor completes its  job  and  I  am
sure that by the end of this week, when  the  portfolio  committee  and  the
joint standing committee get their report, we shall be briefed on  this.  We
need to make sure that we limit the roles and  positions  of  influence  any
individual can hold within any procurement process. This is in the  interest
of the process itself and the individuals concerned. The issues relating  to
conflict of interest  must  be  dealt  with  decisively  within  the  Public
Service in general.

We must congratulate those  departments  that  have  begun  to  tackle  this
matter. We must recommend that  strong  sanctions  be  carried  out  against
persons found to have been  engaged  in  any  unprofessional  activity.  All
allegations, all inappropriate actions must be investigated and  appropriate
action must be carried out. We have raised our queries around  the  security
clearance and made recommendations in this regard. We are also  hoping  that
as we get a briefing from the  department,  the  issues  around  the  Gripen
versus  the  Cheetah  and  the  issues  around  the  advisability   of   the
operational budget of the SA Airforce  shall  be  revisited.  Capacity  must
also be  built  within  Parliament  to  determine  issues  of  this  nature.
Oversight must be understood as a tool to entrench  democracy  and  it  must
not be seen as an irritant, or as a competition  of  Parliament  versus  the
executive. The flow of information must be qualitative to enable  Parliament
to play its monitoring role and to be truly representative of the people.

Public hearings enable us to collect and to consult and to  be  mandated  by
the people and this must be better resourced. Public hearings also  give  us
the chance to clarify and to listen. The committees of  Parliament  must  be
resourced to carry out its work. Parliament should have  had  sight  of  the
acquisition policy and procedures.  Parliament  should  be  able  to  obtain
comprehensive briefings on the price  structures  so  that  it  can  satisfy
itself that what is being acquired is affordable and  absolutely  necessary.
MPs  must,  however,  also  take  matters   of   security   seriously.   The
Constitution allows for sufficient transparency, which means  that  we  have
no right to seek the media limelight at the expense of the security of  this
country. Something called patriotism must begin to  say  something  in  each
and every one's breast.

Parliament must follow up and show that what recommendations  the  different
committees put forward are followed through. The  joint  standing  committee
must begin to exercise the powers to identify policy gaps and  to  recommend
such policy alternatives where necessary. We must reiterate our belief  that
security includes the safety of the person, of the  state,  of  shelter,  of
breathable air, potable water, of  the  soil  and  of  the  environment.  We
accept that South Africa has not been different from most countries in  that
our defence budget has consistently been decreasing. We must also  make  the
point that the money for the naval and airforce acquisitions  cannot  simply
be seen as an increase in the defence budget but that we  must  actually  be
realistic and understand that  it  is  money  simply  flowing  through  this
defence account.

Yes, we need more hospitals. Yes, we need  more  schools  and  more  houses.
Yes, we need more jobs and we need to secure the  gains  of  the  revolution
and therefore we must make sure that when we call for  the  cancellation  of
the trenches, we must be realistic. When one does that, one is  compromising
one of the basic things which people in South Africa fought for. We must  be
sure that we are ready for a September 11-type attack.  [Interjections.]  We
must be sure that we have the right equipment and  the  right  training  for
our people.

At the end I must say that there are too many findings in the report and  it
found that there was no evidence of any improper or unlawful conduct by  the
Government. It finds that there were improprieties. It  finds  that  certain
conduct of officials was questionable. It makes recommendations  on  how  to
deal  with  these  matters.  There  are  matters  where  investigations  are
continuing and there are these matters where arrests have been made.

I want to thank the Public  Protector,  the  Auditor-General,  the  National
Prosecutor for they have done a job for South Africa.  We  must  thank  them
and we must make sure that the recommendations before us  are  carried  out,
and where these are inadequate, proper recommendations  and  mechanisms  are
set in place to make sure that never, ever again  would  we  spend  time  to
look back at what we could have avoided. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker and hon  members,  this  debate  is  not  about
personalities and, to an extent, it is  not  about  corvettes,  Gripens  and
other military hardware. It is about the integrity of our  institutions  and
the failures of our democracy. It is about all of  us  and  whether  we  can
fulfil the promise to monitor what the executive does  and  investigate  and
correct that which in any democracy goes wrong.

Democracy is not about flawless government. All governments  make  mistakes.
Democracy is about investigating, exposing and  correcting  flaws.  The  JIT
report failed to deal with the issues raised in  Scopa's  fourteenth  report
and  refute  the  concerns  it  expressed.  Having  different  parliamentary
committees examining  the  report  diluted  the  role  of  Scopa,  the  only
committee to  have  had  access  to  privileged  documentation  and  Cabinet
minutes.
The reports bear testimony to the fact that our  constitutional  checks  and
balances failed to expose and investigate the flaws. The  battle  for  truth
and democracy had to be carried out on behalf of all members  by  a  handful
of courageous and principled people who, in the end, were all  defeated  and
forced to resign. Our resignation was the symbolic  defeat  of  Parliament's
own power to rise to the challenge of holding this executive to account.

South Africa's parliamentary democracy was put to the test in  probing  this
deal.  It  was  put  to  the  test  in  demanding  from  the  executive  the
responsibility due to Parliament for its actions and decisions. It  was  put
to the test for its spending priorities in arming for imaginary  wars  while
the wars on poverty, Aids and hunger are  being  lost.  [Interjections.]  It
put to the test the moral trade-offs Government made and continues  to  make
in saving the local defence industry at  the  cost  and  expense  of  social
delivery. It put to the test the  values  and  ethics  of  bearers  of  high
offices and public servants. This Government failed these tests.

It failed the test of transparency. It failed the test  of  constitutionally
demanded accountability, but most important  of  all  and  most  tragic,  it
failed  the  test  of  integrity.   [Interjections.]   This   left   damaged
institutions, damaged individuals and shattered public trust in the wake  of
the ANC Government's arrogance and impunity. [Interjections.]

From the beginning of the arms investigation the preoccupation  of  the  ANC
was twofold: an exoneration of  the  executive  of  any  corruption  charges
which it misguidedly believed the Standing Committee on Public Accounts  had
levelled  against  it  and  ensuring  the  contractual   validity   of   the
agreements, including the IP agreements, would not be called  into  question
by  any  investigating  body,  but  more  particularly  the  Heath   Special
Investigating Unit. The position of the President in his  national  address,
the Deputy President in his  all  but  hysterical  letter  to  the  standing
committee, four Ministers in their  press  briefing  in  January  and  their
subsequent appearance  before  Parliament,  the  ANC's  Scopa  members  and,
interestingly,  the  JIT  report's   conclusions   all   emphasise   Cabinet
exoneration, firstly, and contractual validity, secondly -  a  very  similar
song-sheet indeed. Too similar perhaps to be coincidence.

In Government's response to the JIT report  it  chose  to  home  in  on  the
following contestable finding: No evidence was  found  of  any  improper  or
unlawful conduct by the Government.  The  irregularities  and  improprieties
point to the conduct of certain  officials  of  the  Government  departments
involved  and  cannot  be  ascribed  to  the  President  or  the  Minister's
committee or Cabinet. There are therefore no grounds  to  suggest  that  the
Government's contracting position was flawed. [Interjections.]

AN HON MEMBER: What happened to Harksen's money?

Ms R TALJAARD: This attempt at a stark distinction between a government  and
its public servants will make the compilers of  the  Scott  Report  on  arms
deals appear completely amateurish.

It became evident that the public would be thrown sacrificial lambs who  got
cars  or  Cabinet  documents.  The  big  issues  would  remain  unaddressed,
unprobed and uninvestigated. The  ink  barely  dried  on  the  contracts  in
December 1999 when political manipulations began curtailing  the  relentless
pursuit of truth. The special audit of the arms deal in 2000 by the Auditor-
General was subjected to an audit steering committee comprising some of  the
key individuals under investigation.

In Scopa the ANC blocked the committee from continuing with  its  own  probe
as envisaged both in the 14th report and  constitutionally  permitted  under
sections 55 and 56 of the Constitution.  Meetings  took  place  between  the
executive and the Auditor-General before and during this investigation  that
would  seem,  apart  from  the  obvious  and  patently   clearly   political
questions, madness in the context of  Enron-dicta  on  the  advisable  arm's
length relationship between auditor and auditee.

Similarly, in the private sector with the private  auditing  firm  that  was
involved in this deal at a subcontracting level, the  similar  question  and
context of conflict of interest  arises  with  an  auditing  firm  that  was
investigating some of the very companies  that  it  audits.  These  meetings
between the executive and the  Auditor-General  raised  pertinent  questions
about the independence of this probe. These questions arose again  when  the
executive had the opportunity to sanitise the final report of the JIT  under
draconian remnants of executive control lodged at the heart of the  Auditor-
General's Act in section 4(6) of the Act.

Madam Speaker, let us not forget that even on the question of your role  and
the role of your unprecedented press statement  in  this  sordid  saga  this
House was divided with only the  majority  party  expressing  support  in  a
motion of confidence debate. But  what  happens  in  a  new  democracy  when
political  manipulations  and  agendas  stifle   the   pursuit   of   truth?
Conspiracies  of  complicit  silence  rob  public  representatives  and  key
institutions,  tasked  with  protecting  public  trust  and   constitutional
democracy, of their integrity, their worth and their credibility.

This is the truth that has emerged from the arms deal saga  that  cannot  be
hidden. South Africa has damaged institutions. This is  the  legacy  of  the
JIT report and the profoundly lacking committee reports  we  finally  debate
today. It is nothing more than a sad footnote to what  should  have  been  a
profound   encounter   with   accountable   governance   for   this   second
democratically elected Government  and  the  second  democratically  elected
Parliament. Instead, the case  of  the  arms  deal  shows  an  arrogant  and
unaccountable government, making  bad  decisions  that  display  a  shocking
disregard for the real needs of the people.

The nature and contours of the global arms industry are vividly captured  in
Anthony Sampson's immortal book The Arms Bazaar. Since  its  publication  in
1977 the industry has remained very similar, with  intricate  webs  of  arms
suppliers, governments arms dealers, influenced peddlers, arms  brokers  and
the murky world of bribes, commissions and party funding the hallmark.

Examples abound. In France the fall of Minister Dumas  linked  to  Thompson-
CSF's orders for frigates for Taiwan. In  Germany  Karlheinz  Schreiber  and
the Thyssen's tanks scandal which  nearly  toppled  the  CDU  government  of
Helmut  Kohl.  In  Britain  BAE  systems'  Al  Yamamah  contract   and   the
countertrade deal and offsets in Saudi Arabia, which brought  into  question
the  credibility  and  integrity  of  minister  Jonathan  Aitken  and   Mark
Thatcher. And, I might add, the NAO report on Al Yamamah has still not  been
debated in the British parliament and this is cold comfort to the people  in
this parliament.

Hon members may have noticed that these three companies also  happen  to  be
our suppliers in this arms deal. [Interjections.] As  Dwight  D.  Eisenhower
eloquently captured it:


  Under the spur of profit potential, powerful lobbies spring up  to  argue
  for even larger ammunitions expenditures. And the web of special interest
  grows.

In South Africa's arms deal, as has been the case  in  so  many  before  it,
opportunities for acquisitions we could not afford and did  not  immediately
require were seized  upon  by  zealous  arms  suppliers  with  officials  of
dubious  integrity  noticing   get-rich-quick   schemes   linked   to   this
procurement. Whether these schemes took the form of rushing out  of  Cabinet
or indeed  the  IONT  into  a  related  industry  accepting  a  luxury  car,
accepting a gift or another benefit or accepting  or  paying  a  commission,
the JIT report failed to reveal the full picture of what transpired in  this
deal or, at worst, mildly rebuke the  transgresses  as  it  did  the  former
minister of defence, Minister Joe Modise.

To believe that, somehow, we would be immune  from  the  hallmarks  of  this
globally maligned industry beggars belief. To  believe  that  ours  was  the
first global virginal arms deal  equally  smacks  of  at  best  unforgivable
naivety or, at worst, gross arrogance and political  manipulation.  In  this
deal ANC Inc.  and  the  MK  Inc.  succumbed  to  the  profligacy  of  self-
enrichment above ethical conduct. In a world  littered  with  brokers  where
commissions, fees and party payments are the common currency of  the  trade,
is a staggering omission, apart from its  other  glaring  shortcomings,  for
the JIT report not to have probed any party donations to  the  ANC,  and  to
not even have posed the question as to whether South Africa had to  pay  any
commissions or fees to arms brokers.  This  is  the  oil  that  greases  the
global arms industry. Anybody who does not believe this and  does  not  read
the literature of the industry is naive.

Instead of probing it and scrutinising  any  role  it  may  have  played  in
securing prime or subcontracts, our JIT failed  to  answer  these  pertinent
questions. Issue by issue Scopa's much maligned 14th report, while  insulted
and rebuffed  by  the  JIT,  has  been  all  but  completely  vindicated  by
Transparency International UK's recent comprehensive  study  on  the  global
arms trade. In their report they list key areas of  concern,  including  the
delivery  and  monitoring  of  offsets  in   the   context   of   commercial
confidentiality. The loading of price to cater for  offset  guarantees,  the
vagaries of secrecy and commercial  confidentiality  in  the  industry,  the
need to limit discretion  of  single  individuals  and  a  host  of  further
vindications. Paragraph by paragraph their concerns  form  a  perfect  match
with Scopa's 14th report and what it sought to probe  and  the  issues  that
were left untouched or glossed over by a very weak JIT report.

The history of South Africa's strategic defence procurement, is the  history
of an unsound, highly contestable and irresponsible decision-making  process
for equipment the country cannot afford in a context where the  basic  needs
of the Defence Force, and indeed our people, are  not  being  met,  and  the
role of the SANDF is  changing  with  the  peacekeeping  trust.  It  is  the
history of a process that exposes the lack of  executive  accountability  to
Parliament. It is the legacy of prioritising the wrong, nonexistent  enemies
and wars when the war on poverty, Aids and  hunger  is  and  should  be  our
highest priority if not our national emergency. We cannot fight poverty  and
Aids  with  corvettes,   submarines,   helicopters   and   fighter   planes.
[Interjections.]
Madam Speaker and colleagues, this is my heartfelt wish  at  the  conclusion
of this very sad debate: May Parliament  recover  from  the  arms  deal  ...
[Interjections.] ... and may we never again bow the knee to the dictates  of
the executive. We owe the people who elected us more than kowtowing  to  our
political masters and not abiding by our elected and our electoral  mandate.
It is already happening in the defection case. Let us  not  repeat  what  we
did in this deal.

Mr G SOLOMON: Madam Speaker, we need to remind the  hon  Taljaard  that  the
Joint Investigation Report into the Strategic Defence Procurement  Packages,
was undertaken by institutions  no  less  than  the  Public  Protector,  the
Auditor-General  and  the  National   Director   of   Public   Prosecutions.
[Interjections.]

It  is  also  important  to  state  here  that  the  whole  process  of   an
investigation was triggered by  the  proactive  initiative  of  the  Defence
Audit Centre in the Office of the Auditor-General,  with  the  agreement  of
the Minister of Defence, when it identified  the  procurement  of  strategic
defence packages as a higher risk area from  an  audit  point  of  view  and
decided on the need to perform a special review of the procurement process.

In this debate, to put it mildly, I wish to deal with the unbecoming way  in
which the opposition related to the three institutions which dealt with  the
investigation. The Public Protector, the Auditor-General  and  the  National
Director of Public  Prosecution  are  amongst  the  impressive  institutions
created to strengthen constitutional democracy in our country.  Their  track
records speak for themselves and we can genuinely be proud of  them.  It  is
not necessary for me to elevate these institutions. The Constitution  itself
clearly documents the elevated status of these institutions. And I quote:


  These institutions are independent and subject only to  the  Constitution
  and the law and they must be impartial and  must  exercise  their  powers
  without fear,  favour  or  prejudice.  Other  organs  of  state,  through
  legislative  and  other  measures,  must   assist   and   protect   these
  institutions to ensure  their  independence,  impartiality,  dignity  and
  effectiveness of these institutions. No person  or  organ  of  state  may
  interfere with the functioning of these institutions.
The challenge that faced these institutions in this  investigation  impacted
directly on  the  reason  for  their  existence,  namely  to  be  impartial,
objective, independent in the interest of South Africa and its people. I  am
sure there is none in this House or in this country,  including  the  media,
who can question the  integrity,  courage  and  uncompromising  standard  of
intellectual  competence  of  any  of   these   institutions   as   far   as
investigations are concerned. In  fact,  no  one  from  the  opposition  has
challenged any of their recommendations.

The problem that individuals from the opposition faced was that the  results
of the investigation did not confirm their perceptions, prejudices and self-
interests or whatever they conjured up in  their  minds.  They  were  hoping
that something seriously would be wrong  with  the  process  and  they  were
disappointed.

The results of our personal or party-political thoughts, influenced  by  our
prejudices and petty self-interest, can never be the unique content  of  the
truth. That is why we have judicial processes underpinned  by  the  rule  of
law entrenched in our Constitution. South Africa is not the only country  in
the  world  that   has   constitutional   obligations   and   national   and
international commitments that might warrant the procurement of  arms.  But,
indeed, it is certainly one of the few, if  not  the  only  country  in  the
world that is so  open,  transparent  and  accountable  about  the  process,
despite  the  international  practice  of  secrecy  on   matters   of   arms
procurement. [Interjections.] For this, we should  applaud  this  Government
led by the ANC. [Applause.]

A fundamental question needs to be asked in this debate today. The  question
is how do we, as Parliament,  relate  to  the  Chapter  9  institutions  and
particularly, in this regard, to those institutions  that  tabled  the  duly
signed Joint Report to the House on 14th November 2001. Instead of  allowing
the  three  institutional  structures  to  exercise   their   constitutional
functions  without  interference,  opposition  parties   embarked   upon   a
discourse which was clearly sensational and sinister, casting aspersions  on
the integrity of these Chapter 9 institutions as  well  as  the  Cabinet  of
this Government. This was duly taken up  by  the  media  for  which  it  was
obviously intended, accusing the Cabinet  of  blowing  billions  on  fighter
jets, helicopters, ships and submarines and that  the  Department  of  Trade
and Industry perpetrated a lie about significant socio-economic benefits.

The worst part of this disgusting discourse was  the  scurrilous  attack  on
the Chapter 9 institutions and  the  confused  and  contradictory  positions
held by opposition members. On the one hand, the opposition parties  slammed
the hon Selby Baqwa for denying television rights to broadcast the  hearings
live in order to protect witnesses.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, please take a seat. I just wish  to  make  a
comment. I want to draw the hon member's attention and all  members  in  the
House to Rule 66 which makes it very clear  that  no  member  shall  reflect
upon the competence or honour of a judge or a superior court or  the  holder
of an office whose removal from such office is dependent upon a decision  of
this House, except upon a substantive motion in this  House  alleging  facts
and so on.

Now I am drawing attention to this not because  of  what  has  already  been
said, though it was on the border, but to avoid us going in that  direction.
We are not going to debate the integrity of any of  those  institutions.  So
please, I appeal to both sides of the House that  by  putting  that  on  the
agenda, members are provoking a  debate  of  this  kind.  So,  I  would  ask
members not to attack the institutions and not to  put  that  issue  on  the
table because by so doing, members would be provocative. I really wish  that
this debate should deal with the substance  rather  than  dealing  with  the
particular institutions.

If there are any members on either side who have problems  with  the  office
holders,  would  those  members  please  follow  this  rule  and   place   a
substantive motion before the House. This is an appeal and I do not wish  to
stop the debate if we go in that direction. In my view there is  no  debate,
hon Asmal, so we will now proceed.

Are you rising a point of order Mr Asmal?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION:  Is  it  possible  for  you,  Madam  Speaker,  to
identify these scurrilous remarks that were made?

The SPEAKER: Order! If the hon member could identify any scurrilous  or  any
other comments, I will deal with the rules ...

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Inaudible.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, take your seat please.  Hon  members  please
let the debate proceed. I had to intervene, because I believed that we  were
getting to a point which would have been harmful to the  debate.  So  please
proceed, Mr Solomon.

Mr G SOLOMON: As I was saying, on the one hand  opposition  parties  slammed
the hon Selby Baqwa for denying television rights to broadcast the  hearings
live in order to protect witnesses. [Interjections.] On the other hand,  the
hon Patricia De Lille of the PAC, refused to  attend  the  hearings  because
lives are at stake and people  could  be  killed  for  incriminating  others
involved in the arms deal. The  high  court  subsequently  upheld  the  wise
decision of the hon Selby Baqwa.

The PAC insisted that it wanted a full investigation, free  of  interference
from the ANC and the executive. In the same breath, the hon Reverend  Mogoba
challenged the National Director of Public Prosecutions  to  be  responsible
and reveal to the nation the investigation into certain people  whose  names
they know.
The hon Taljaard accused the National Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  of
strong-arm tactics when he exercised his powers of subpoena  vested  in  him
by the Constitution and the law. The UDM leader,  the  hon  Bantu  Holomisa,
accused the National Director of Public  Prosecutions  of  intimidation  and
even made  the  unintelligent  suggestion  that  cars  should  be  impounded
without due process and the rule of law.

The FA however, was more intelligent and level-headed about the  matter.  It
stressed the need to modernise outdated and obsolete equipment in the  SANDF
in order to meet national obligations to guard our  coastline,  protect  our
fishing waters and patrol our borders. If the costs justify this,  then  the
FA is happy. These are just some of the points of the  unbecoming  discourse
around the Chapter 9  institutions  involved  in  the  investigations.  This
clearly undermines the integrity of these institutions and their  functions.
It is my view that this debate is overstated.  The  opposition  is  scraping
the bottom of the barrel. Only repetitive dregs are  surfacing,  serving  no
purpose except party-political ends.

It is now time to stop and carry on with more important  functions  of  this
Government. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Speaker, yes, there  is  a  predominant  question  which
lies behind any discussion concerning the strategic arms  package.  Why  has
this Parliament so passively allowed Government to  commit  R60  billion  of
the public's money to military hardware, when the sufferings of millions  of
people - sick, poor and hungry people - intensifies in South Africa.  It  is
with this predicament in mind that I direct my attention  to  the  committee
reports, which are the issue of this debate.

The  insubstantial  quality  of  these  committee  reports  is   the   final
confirmation of  the  purposeful  failure  of  this  Parliament  to  conduct
oversight over one of the largest and most controversial spending  exercises
ever by our South African Government.

The seriousness of this failure rivals even the  shameful  extremes  of  the
arms deal itself. And it is with this in mind that  I  will  today  place  a
number of contentious and irresponsible actions on  Hansard  records,  which
will help to explain the subversion of the investigation which  took  place,
and help to  explain  the  appalling  quality  of  the  Joint  Investigating
Team's, the JIT's, report.

And, as can be noted from the accounts which I  have  already  published  on
these and other arms deal-related matters, I am able to  authenticate  every
issue I raised against the body of evidence which  includes  correspondence,
verbatim transcriptions, minutes, press reports and signed affidavits.

I  do  acknowledge,  however,  that  for  the  seven  committees  that  were
instructed  into  the  investigation-related  processes  at  the  very  last
minute, their only sin was to allow themselves to be used  as  part  of  the
greater scheme to negate proper interrogation of the  JIT's  work.  But  for
the remaining committee, Scopa, there is  no  such  excuse.  Its  grovelling
report, from today, will  serve  as  a  permanent  record  of  its  cowardly
betrayal  of  the  public  whose  interest  it   is   supposed   to   serve.
[Interjections.]

After Scopa had studied the Auditor-General's initial  review  of  the  arms
deal back in 2000, it then held hearings with the Department of Defence  and
the other departments, and undertook further investigations into  particular
issues  itself  and  then  produced  its  14th  report  to  Parliament,  and
Parliament adopted that report at the beginning of November 2000.

The report identified a number of concerns  for  further  investigation  and
recommended that not only would Scopa continue with its own  investigations,
but  that  a  joint  investigation  also  be  undertaken  by  the   National
Directorate of Public  Prosecutions,  the  Public  Protector,  the  Auditor-
General and the Heath Special Investigation Unit. Everything  seemed  to  be
in place for Scopa and the four agencies to do what they were obliged to  do
- to establish that public funds were being efficiently and honestly spent.

But  what  immediately  became  clear  was   an   antagonism   towards   the
investigation from amongst  the  executive.  The  Minister  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development called it an ``unnecessary fishing  expedition''.
The Minister in the Office of the President questioned the  loyalty  of  the
ANC members in Scopa for having supported the investigation.

In their  press  statement  of  12  January,  the  Ministers  of  Trade  and
Industry, of Finance and  of  Public  Enterprises  insultingly  referred  to
Scopa and Parliament's 14th report and its reason for the investigations  as
``cursory,   ill-informed,   unable   to   understand   elementary   issues,
exceedingly misleading,  stretching  credulity'',  and  so  on.  The  Deputy
President, in his hostile and intimidatory letter to me of 19 January  2001,
claimed that Scopa was accusing the Government  of  being  prone  to  fraud,
corruption and dishonesty. Of course, we had the Chief Whip of the  Majority
Party claiming that Scopa's report, which had called for the  investigation,
had been sneaked past the ANC hierarchy and, of course, he  blamed  the  hon
Andrew Feinstein.

Alongside all these moves were the moves to weaken the investigation.  First
was the move to exclude the Special Investigation Unit - SIU.  The  Ministry
for  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  began  with  an   anti-Heath
position in December 2000, followed by the abruptly  changed  views  of  the
Director of Public Prosecutions and the Public Protector.  This  is  all  on
record, as I might remind hon  members  -  their  views  towards  the  SIU's
participation.

Within days, there was the  Speaker's  astonishing  press  statement  on  27
December, where she contrived Scopa's 14th report to say  that  it  did  not
want the SIU involved. And again, within days, there was  the  Minister  for
Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  using  her  interpretation,  when
writing to the President, recommending the SIU's exclusion.

These developments, together with political instruction from  the  whippery,
saw the ANC's members in Scopa do a complete about-turn on  the  SIU  issue,
notwithstanding the irrefutability  of  their  original  position.  The  hon
Johnny de Lange tried to help by producing a paper on the  unsuitability  of
the SIU, but in so doing, he directly contradicted the explanation  he  gave
to this House on 29 October 1996 where he  explained  the  uniquely  special
and powerful investigative powers of the SIU  which,  incidentally,  concurs
with the independent legal opinion which was received by Scopa.

Then, after the Auditor-General, together  with  the  National  Director  of
Public Prosecutions and the Public Protector, held an inappropriate  meeting
with  the  President  and  the  Minister  for  Justice  and   Constitutional
Development, the Auditor-General too realigned his  view  and,  on  national
television, said the investigating team could do without the SIU.
This notwithstanding his earlier letter to the Chairperson of Scopa,  saying
the team requires the special skills and experience of the  SIU  and  urging
me to write to the President for the SIU's involvement.

Then eventually, in his own televised broadcast, the  President  advised  of
his decision to exclude the SIU, amongst other things  citing  his  reliance
on the report of the two-man team he had had look into  the  matter.  As  we
know, a few weeks later, in Business Day, they published a copy of the  two-
man team report, the Khan and Lubbe report, to the  President,  saying  that
Khan and Lubbe had in fact urged the President to  include  the  SIU  as  an
imperative.

The elimination of the  SIU  would  seem  to  have  cost  the  investigation
dearly. This included the evidence of the would-be whistle-blowers from  the
Department of  Defence  and  within  the  arms  industry  to  advise  Andrew
Feinstein and myself, amongst others, of their wish to  present  significant
evidence but only to the SIU. In at  least  two  cases,  the  SIU's  special
tribunal arrangements could have conducted informative civil processes.

The investigation was further weakened when the ANC members prevented  Scopa
from  undertaking  the  investigation  it  had  promised  Parliament.  Every
initiative I and other opposition members took to do this work  was  blocked
by them. I then requested information  from  the  Department  of  Trade  and
Industry and Defence, in my capacity as a member of Parliament.  Of  course,
they refused me.

Now, also essential to the investigation was regular  communication  between
Scopa and  the  JIT.  Notwithstanding  having  assured  the  Speaker  on  15
December 2000  that  Scopa  had  no  intention  of  overstepping  its  legal
boundary and having agreed to seek expert assurance on the matter,  she,  in
her 27 December  press  statement  inferred  that  Scopa  was  intending  to
instruct the JIT.

A few weeks later, she called  the  hon  Geoff  Doidge  and  myself  into  a
meeting she was having with the heads  of  the  JIT  and  asked  me  for  my
understanding of the JIT-Scopa communication arrangements.  I  did  this  by
putting forward the legal opinion given by Prof. Fink Haysom. As no  one  at
the meeting would respond to my  explanation,  my  suspicion  caused  me  to
write to the Speaker, after the meeting, and ask her  if  she  supported  my
explanation. She never replied to my letter.

Other than a meeting early in 2001 with the Auditor-General's  staff,  there
was no communication at all between Scopa and the JIT. All attempts to  have
discussions were either rejected by the ANC component or evaded by the  JIT,
leaving Scopa never knowing what the investigation it had requested  was  or
was not covering.

Because of his centrality to the process, I need to comment on the  puzzling
actions of the Auditor-General beyond his change of mind about  the  SIU.  I
will do this without suggesting or inferring any dishonesty on his  part.  I
will simply list factual instances, which are already in the public  domain,
which are very relevant to the accountability process which we are  alluding
to today.

Firstly, the meetings  he  held  with  the  President,  in  particular,  the
members of the executive, were inappropriate because of their  role  in  the
special Cabinet subcommittee which was central to the arms deal.

Then there was the Auditor-General's  removal  of  the  investigation's  two
most qualified officials after they had expressed concern about  a  weakened
investigation. Then he banned communication between his investigation  staff
and members of Scopa. He acceded to the politically motivated  wish  for  no
interim accountability to Parliament. Then, in June,  he  advised  that  the
JIT report would be ready for Parliament in August. He confirmed this  again
in July, but it never came in August. In fact, it never came in September.

Then, in early October, he told Scopa that his  team  were  having  to  work
night and day in order to finish the  report  before  Parliament  closed  in
November. He never did explain why the JIT has suddenly come  to  need  that
extraordinary extra  amount  of  time.  We  then  learnt  through  Mail  and
Guardian that the delay coincided with the secret release of  the  draft  of
the report to members of the executive - this under the pretext  of  an  old
apartheid law  which  P  W  Botha  used  to  protect  his  clandestine  arms
dealings, a law which is patently not in keeping with our new  Constitution.
[Interjections.]

Now, at more or less the same time, there were  alleged  leaks  from  within
the JIT in the newspapers claiming that members  of  the  executive  and  Mr
Chippy Shaik's attorney had demanded  substantial  changes  to  the  report.
These stories appeared to arouse the suspicions to the  point  where,  under
the Promotion of Access to Information Act, at least one  outside  party  is
demanding to see the drafts which were quietly given to the executive.

This in turn seems to have led the Auditor-General to now be  fighting  wars
on two fronts. One by engaging lawyers to try and prevent  the  public  from
seeing the drafts in question - why? The other is using  tough  measures  to
prevent leaks from members of the JIT. It is said that he has  warned  staff
of jail sentences sentences from under a provision of the National  Director
of Public Prosecutions Act. And, as we also know, he has subjected a  number
of senior team members to lie-detector tests. There are a  number  of  other
related issues which I could refer to.

All that I have alluded to  this  afternoon  shows  that  we  are  left  not
knowing the full extent of the corrupted process. But, what we  do  know  is
that the process has produced a seriously deficient report in which the  JIT
ignored most of the issues listed in  Scopa's  14th  report.  We  also  know
that, after 12 months of very costly work, the JIT was not able  to  produce
any new findings. The report's bulk is  the  recording  and  cataloguing  of
documents, procedures and historical perspectives.

There is almost  no  forensic  level  or  other  form  of  analysis  towards
establishing missing explanations in the report. Most questions  are  simply
avoided. Against this, may I remind hon  members  of  my  widely  publicised
critique of the JIT's work.  This  critique,  which  exposes  more  than  50
significant shortcomings, remains unchallenged, and is soon to be  added  to
by some telling observations made by members of the  forensic  investigation
community.

Everything about the arms deal and the strategic package is deplorable:  The
quality  of  its  transaction;  the  quality  of  investigation  into  those
transactions, the actions of those that undermined  the  investigation;  the
failure  of  this  Parliament  to  defend  the  public  interest   and   our
parliamentary democracy and, most of all, the huge and painful sacrifices  -
the demands of the country's people.

The only redeeming prospect is that, slowly  but  surely,  some  of  us  are
succeeding in having history  accurately  record  what  has  happened.  This
emerging  truth  will  ultimately  punish  those  who  have  betrayed   this
Parliament and the people it represents. [Applause.]

Mr B W KANNEMEYER: Madam Speaker, I believe that  no  matter  how  hard  one
believes in something, or how committed one is to a particular cause,  there
must be moral and ethical guidelines  that  must  dictate  the  extremes  to
which one would go to defend what one believes in.

To start my contribution to this debate I would like to say  that  when  the
chairperson,  or  the  previous  chairperson,  of  Scopa   refers   to   the
unsubstantial quality of the committee reports, he should also  inform  this
House that during the two-day session of interaction with the heads  of  the
different institutions - the Public Protector, the Auditor-General  and  the
National Director of Public Prosecutions - he chose  to  sit  silent  during
the two-day  session  and  not  ask  one  single  question.  [Applause.]  He
preferred to raise his issues in the public media where they  would  not  be
subject to question and to cross-examination.

Likewise, with regard to hon Taljaard and the DP in general,  at  the  first
hearing into the special review of the arms procurement process,  which  was
held on 10 October 2000, of a total of 3 000 lines  of  evidence  the  total
sum of the DP's contribution to that debate was nine lines -  0,03%  of  the
total evidence in the debate which started this whole process. And that  was
done by Mr Graham McIntosh, and when the DP realised  that  this  was  juicy
and sexy, it was the first party to remove two members  of  its  party  from
Scopa and replace them with the  so-called  hon  Ms  Taljaard  -  firebrand,
double-barrelled Master's degree ... [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon members.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, there are only hon members;, there  are  not
``so-called'' hon members.

Mr B W  KANNEMEYER:  ...  the  hon  Taljaard,  with  her  so-called  double-
barrelled  degrees  to  come  and  give  new  fight  and  fire   to   Scopa.
[Interjections.]

Having said that, let  me  proceed  to  my  contribution.  As  indicated  by
Comrade Modise, the strategic arms package was indeed about  the  obligation
of the executive to defend the country, its borders and its assets, and  was
done  in  a  parliamentary,  agreed-to  defence  review.  The  exercise   of
reviewing the strategic defence procurement package process,  on  the  other
hand, was then essentially about the constitutional obligation of  oversight
and accountability that indeed this Parliament is tasked with.

A lot has been said about  the  investigation  into  the  strategic  defence
procurement package, but the reality is that much of what has been said  and
written was done in the context of extreme  political  posturing  from  most
sides  of  the  political  spectrum,  and  informed  in  some  instances  by
genuinely  concerned  individuals,  but  unfortunately  on  the  other  hand
tainted by the dubious interests of  varying  lobbyists  and  probably  even
losing bidders.

We must admit that it is exactly the open, free and transparent  environment
brought about by an ANC-led  Government  that  allowed  whistle-blowers  the
space to come forward and raise the type of concerns which they  could  and,
in fact, did raise. However, the simple submission  of  information  by  any
whistle-blower does not in itself amount to guilt or  fact.  Therefore,  the
way in which the  Government  then  responded  to  this  information  is  an
important lesson and fact which the  opposition  chooses  to  ignore  or  to
accept.

And the fact is that it was the Minister of  Defence  who  called  upon  the
Auditor-General to  produce  a  special  review  on  the  strategic  defence
procurement package and process. And it was this subsequent  report  of  the
Auditor-General  that  provided  the  basis  for  Scopa,   Parliament   and,
subsequently, the joint investigating team, or  JIT,  to  consider  concerns
raised in connection with the arms package.

Turning to the 14th report of  the  public  accounts  committee,  a  lot  of
criticism has been levelled against this committee  and  later  against  the
ANC component of it. Let me consider a number of questions in that regard.

Did Scopa have the right to produce its 14th report and raise  the  type  of
questions and concerns that it did? I am saying, indeed, we had  the  right.
And the special report of the  Auditor-General  was  referred  to  Scopa  in
terms of Parliament's Rules and procedures  and,  clearly,  Scopa  therefore
had  the  responsibility  to  consider  findings  of  the  Auditor-General's
special review, as well as submissions made.

Whilst at this stage admitting to some shortcomings in our  own  process,  I
remain convinced that Scopa, and the ANC component in it, were not at  fault
in reporting our findings to the National  Assembly  at  the  time.  It  is,
however, said with a clear understanding  and  appreciation  that  ours  was
only a report to the National Assembly and the  National  Assembly  had  the
responsibility to accept, reject or amend any or all of the  recommendations
contained in that specific report. The National Assembly, in accepting  that
report, became then the institution that  made  the  recommendation  to  the
executive for an independent, expert forensic investigation.

Madam Speaker, it is in  this  regard,  then,  that  your  interaction,  the
interaction of the Deputy President and indeed of the  executive,  in  terms
of the report, was placed in a  particular  context.  Once  the  committee's
report is adopted by the National Assembly,  in  my  limited  understanding,
that report does become the responsibility of  the  National  Assembly.  The
Speaker then has the responsibility to take that report forward.  Therefore,
when Scopa or, in this case, our  chairperson  at  the  time,  proceeded  to
interact directly with the President or  the  executive,  that  should  have
been the role and the prerogative of the Speaker. Because  the  14th  report
of Scopa  was  adopted  by  the  National  Assembly,  indeed  then  also  as
indicated  by  a  letter  of  the  Speaker  later,  the  Deputy  President's
intervention should also have been addressed to the Office of the Speaker.

However, having said that, there can be no denying the right of  the  Deputy
President  as  leader  of  Government  business   to   interact   with   the
legislature. If any committee - and in this case, Scopa - makes the type  of
serious allegations that we have  made,  against  anyone  affected  by  such
allegations, we cannot deny the right of those so affected to  respond.  And
therefore, indeed, even though we may not like what the executive  has  said
in response to our report, no one  can  deny  the  executive  the  right  to
reply.

Was  the  decision  by  the  National  Assembly  then  to   have   a   joint
investigation into the arms  procurement  process  the  correct  one?  Madam
Speaker, I would suggest that undoubtedly it was, and whether  we  agree  or
do not agree with  the  findings  of  the  Auditor-General  in  his  special
review, that report together with other information - substantiated  or  not
- warranted further investigation to either substantiate the allegations  or
to clear those who stood accused in the light of those allegations.

Therefore, as Scopa's 14th  report  indicates,  the  purpose  of  the  joint
investigation was to prove or disprove the allegations.  This  is  the  part
that the opposition does not want to accept: the report  clearly  said  ``to
prove or disprove'' - there was no assumption that the statements that  were
made were going to be found to be true - ``all the allegations  which  cause
damage to the  perceptions  of  Government''.  The  decision  to  have  this
investigation was therefore both the correct  one  and  indeed  a  necessary
one, as it further  demonstrated  this  Government's  commitment  to  clean,
transparent and good governance.

I think the critical question that the opposition has tried  to  present  to
the public is whether the report of  the  joint  investigating  team  was  a
cover-up. [Interjections.]

Would the hon member like to say that on record? From the very onset of  ...
[Interjections.] I didn't think so.

From the very onset of the joint investigation it became clear that  certain
parties and individuals were only going to  be  happy  with  a  report  that
would implicate Government in some or  other  way  in  corruption.  This  is
underscored by pronouncements before and by the fact that within  less  than
half an hour after the report being made  public  most  opposition  parties,
none of whom would at that time  have  had  sufficient  time  to  study  the
findings and recommendations of the  report,  came  out  and  condemned  the
report as a cover-up.

To substantiate its claims of a cover-up, it even went  further  to  suggest
or to attack the integrity and quality of work of the three  agencies.  This
is terribly sad, and indeed very unfortunate for our young democracy if  one
is going to have the type of  opposition  that  is  only  going  to  support
findings and verdicts of our independent institutions  when  they  give  the
type of verdicts that they want, and undermine the integrity of  those  very
same institutions when they give verdicts that  are  not  to  their  liking.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Only the most cynical amongst us can believe  that  the  JIT  report  was  a
cover-up. I am saying that because for anyone  to  believe  that  the  joint
investigation was a cover-up, you have to believe the following. The  Office
of the Public Protector, the Office  of  the  National  Director  of  Public
Prosecutions, as well as the Office of the  Auditor-General  and  all  those
employed in these offices are corrupt, and were and still are  in  collusion
with  the  so-called  alleged  corrupt  individuals.  Now  even   the   most
unpatriotic amongst us would take this as a little far-fetched.

Without going into the detail of the JIT report, let me reflect on  some  of
the key findings of the report. Even in recognising that the entire  process
of the arms deal was  not  perfect,  everyone  must  agree  that  this  arms
procurement probably rates amongst the  most  transparent  arms  procurement
processes   in   recent   and   past   international   arms   trade   deals.
[Interjections.] Hon  Pierre  Gerber  tells  me  that  under  the  apartheid
government, the way it worked was that one would just wake  up  one  morning
and  find  a  couple  of  new  helicopters  on  one's  doorstep.  There  was
absolutely no transparency.

In dealing with one two perceptions, I quote from the JIT report:


  No evidence was  found  of  any  improper  or  unlawful  conduct  by  the
  Government. The irregularities ...

There is a light flashing. I think that means I am close to finishing.


  ... The irregularities and improprieties referred to in the  findings  as
  contained in this report, point to the conduct of Government and  certain
  officials of Government departments involved and cannot, in our view,  be
  ascribed to the President or the Ministers' Committee or  Cabinet.  There
  are therefore no grounds to suggest  that  the  Government's  contracting
  position is flawed.

This is a direct quotation from the joint  investigating  team  report  and,
whilst clearly exonerating the President and the  executive,  it  is  not  a
blanket whitewash of  the  entire  process.  There  are  areas  specifically
indicated in Chapters  14.1,  where  there  are  specific  shortcomings  and
findings, and in 14.2 recommendations are made to address  the  shortcomings
identified.

In concluding, there are a number of lessons that we need to take from  this
process. Some of those are  that  a  lack  of  proper  systems,  checks  and
balances indeed will make our task  difficult  and  even  worse.  Deviations
from laid-down procedures, although difficult to avoid,  will  always  raise
questions and problems. Therefore, given the fact that we are  sitting  with
the experience that we have had, and the fact that we are  sitting  with  an
opposition that is hellbent on playing a  destructive  role,  the  oversight
and accountability obligation rests particularly heavy on the  shoulders  of
the ANC to even provide leadership in that regard.

For the opposition, I think it is important that they start  realising  that
oversight and accountability, even though  sexy  and  juicy,  are  not  only
about political opportunism. They  actually  require  a  certain  amount  of
moral integrity. In fact, the lure of media coverage and the  excitement  of
radio and television sound bites can never and should never  be  the  driver
of any oversight and accountability  exercise.  To  make  the  parliamentary
committee system work, there is an obligation on the opposition to put in  a
much greater effort to seek consensus. There is  no  way  and  no  democracy
that can provide for a minority veto. It is time that the DP  learn  a  very
simple lesson of democracy, and that is that in  the  event  of  a  lack  of
consensus, the majority shall prevail. [Applause.]

Mr A BLAAS: Madam Speaker, at the outset it must  be  stated  that  although
the joint  investigation  report  on  the  arms  procurement  package  lacks
specific recommendations and clear answers in certain areas,  it  cannot  be
summarily  discarded  as  a  whitewash.  It  is  explicit  about  areas  and
departments in which controls were nonexistent and checks and balances  were
ignored.

The oversight role of Parliament needs to be  rethought.  It  is  much  more
than the role  of  opposition  parties  criticising  Government's  policies.
Parliament, inclusive of all parties, has  a  constitutional  obligation  to
scrutinise legislation  and  policy  to  ensure  proper  delivery  and  good
governance. The strong party system makes it difficult  to  separate  party-
political roles from parliamentary roles. Although  Chapter  9  institutions
were involved, the focus of parliamentary oversight in the case of the  arms
deal shifted to political infighting.

Ministerial  accountability  and  ministerial  responsibility  need  to   be
addressed  as  well.  The  joint  investigating  team  used  a  conservative
approach by exonerating Government from all improper and  unlawful  conduct.
The  team  did  not  indicate  what  Government's  responsibility  was  with
reference to  officials  who  engaged  in  improper  and  unlawful  actions.
Ministers have  a  constitutional  obligation  to  explain  and  account  to
Parliament and the public for departmental actions.

The report indicated a wide  spectrum  of  deficiencies  in  procedures  and
processes that needed to be addressed. The respective portfolio  committees,
and Scopa  specifically,  will  have  to  ensure  close  control  to  ensure
efficient oversight in the implementation of the recommendations as set  out
in the report.

Stemming from the discussions so far, there are some  unanswered  questions.
To be able to ensure thorough transparency, it is considered essential  that
answers to  these  questions  be  given.  It  is  unfortunate  that  Scopa's
recommendations  indicated  no  further  interaction  with  the  ministerial
committee.

Sommige van die tergende vrae wat onbeantwoord bly, is die volgende:  hoekom
is   die   kontrakte    vir    die    korvette    toegeken    voordat    die
bekostigbaarheidstudies voltooi was?  Wie  het  hierdie  opdrag  gegee?  Die
verslag swyg hieroor. Ons betaal te veel vir die  Britse  Hawk-vegvliegtuie.
Hoekom?

Die  verslag  stel  dit  dat  die  Regering  se  kontrakposisie  nie   onder
verdenking is nie. Is die stelling nie dalk voortydig nie? Die  verslag  dui
op  verskeie  ongerymdhede  en  wanpraktyke  wat  met  die  toekenning   van
subkontrakte plaasgevind het. Individuele optredes is ook  onder  verdenking
en prosedures en  direktiewe  is  nie  nagekom  nie.  Daar  bestaan  dus  'n
redelike moontlikheid dat ongerymdhede en wanpraktyke by die toekenning  van
die hoofkontrakte kon voorkom. Is so 'n vrywaring  dan  in  hierdie  stadium
geregverdig?

Die vraag of daar werklik  parlementêre  magtiging  was  om  met  die  volle
bestek van die aankoop voort te gaan spook ook  steeds.  Nieteenstaande  die
feit dat die Verdedigingsoorsig 'n visie vir magspeile en  uitrusting  stel,
bly dit steeds onderhewig aan hersiening en kan dit nie as 'n volmag  beskou
word nie. Bekostigbaarheid en ander  behoeftes  moet  in  aanmerking  geneem
word. Daar word dus geredeneer dat verdere parlementêre magtiging ook  nodig
was. Al was dit  'n  politieke  besluit,  behoort  verduidelikings  hiervoor
gegee te word.

Dit is maar 'n paar kwelvrae wat in  die  lug  bly  hang  en  nie  deur  die
verslag gehanteer word nie.

Enige wapentransaksie van dié omvang, bloot in die lig  van  die  waarde  en
bestek hiervan, is blootgestel aan kritiek. Ons het foute gemaak en ons  het
lesse  geleer.  In  die  gees  van  'n  werklike  demokrasie  moet  absolute
deursigtigheid gehandhaaf word. Stelsels  en  beheermeganismes,  tesame  met
verantwoordelikhede en aanspreeklikhede deur die rolspelers,  moet  in  plek
wees. Geen regering kan  sulke  omstredenheid  soos  ons  hier  ervaar  het,
bekostig nie, maar in die finale instansie gaan die toets egter wees of  die
wapentuig wat ons aangekoop het rand vir rand vir Suid-Afrika  waarde  bied.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Some  of  the  challenging  questions  that  remain  unanswered,  are   the
following: Why were the contracts  for  the  corvettes  awarded  before  the
feasibility studies were completed? Who gave that  instruction?  The  report
is silent on this issue. We  are  paying  too  much  for  the  British  Hawk
fighter aircraft. Why?

The report states that the Government's contractual position  is  not  under
suspicion. Is this statement not perhaps premature?  The  report  points  to
several irregularities and malpractices that occurred  in  the  awarding  of
subcontracts. Individual actions are also  under  suspicion  and  procedures
and directives were  not  adhered  to.  Therefore,  there  is  a  reasonable
possibility that irregularities and malpractices could have occurred in  the
awarding of the major contracts. Is such  an  indemnity  justified  at  this
stage?

In addition there still looms the spectre of  the  question  as  to  whether
there truly was a parliamentary mandate to continue with the full  scope  of
the purchase. Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  Defence  Review  states
vision for force levels and equipment, this remains subject  to  review  and
cannot be considered to be a mandate.

Affordability and other  requirements  must  be  taken  into  consideration.
Therefore, it is argued that further parliamentary  authorisation  was  also
necessary. Even if it was a political decision, certain explanations  should
be given for this.

These are but a few of the worrying questions that remain pending  and  that
are not dealt with by the report.

Any arms transaction of this magnitude, merely  considering  the  value  and
scope thereof, is subject to criticism. We have made some  mistakes  and  we
have  learnt  some  lessons.  In  the  spirit  of  true  democracy  absolute
transparency must be maintained. Systems and  control  mechanisms,  together
with the responsibilities and accountability of  role-players,  must  be  in
place. No government can afford controversy  such  as  we  have  experienced
here, but in the final analysis the test will be  whether,  rand  for  rand,
the arms that we have purchased provide value to South Africa.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker and hon members, it is shocking to note  that
nowhere in the arms deal negotiations have opportunity costs  for  the  deal
been  determined.  After  months  of  investigation,  numerous  reports  and
debates in this Parliament, what do we have? A lot of  talk  and  a  lot  of
documents but a total lack of confidence in the process. We are  faced  with
a farcical attempt by Government which claims that nothing is wrong, all  is
well. Are we to believe this?

After thoroughly reading the joint investigation report again, it  is  clear
that it is a carefully worded document. It fails  to  cut  to  the  bone  on
crucial  issues,  for  instance,  industrial  offsets,  hidden   costs   and
ministerial accountability. Furthermore, by its own admission it  cannot  be
regarded as a complete investigation.

On page 11 of the report it states: ``Areas  of  a  criminal  and  sensitive
nature were considered inappropriate to be included in  this  report.''  The
result was a documentation  of  only  a  chronological  sequence  of  events
relating to the arms deal. A few findings and recommendations were added  as
lessons learnt. No wonder that people have lost faith in  the  investigation
process and that there is a constant questioning of  issues  such  as  value
for money regarding the promised industrial  offsets,  creative  accounting,
the all-inclusive cost of the arms deal to the  taxpayer  and  the  promised
65 000 to-be-created jobs.

The fact that there are so many unanswered questions about  the  arms  deal,
three years after the signing of the contract, is a  clear  indication  that
something major went wrong with this procurement process.  Yet,  nobody  has
been successfully prosecuted to date and nobody is behind  bars.  The  truth
is that the public lost confidence in the process when calls for a  judicial
commission  of  inquiry  were  rejected   and   when   the   Heath   Special
Investigation Unit was stopped from participating in this investigation.

The subsequent interference by the executive,  the  unwarranted  attacks  on
Parliament, the ANC's bad behaviour in the  Public  Accounts  Committee  and
the involvement of the presiding officer, all work together to cast  a  huge
shadow of doubt onto this investigation.

How does one reconcile the finding of the joint  investigation  report  that
senior  government  official  Mr  Chippy  Shaik  was  guilty  of  despicable
behaviour, but the chief of the SANDF  holds  a  farewell  function  for  Mr
Shaik and the official monthly magazine of the  SANDF  states,  last  month,
``Man of distinctions leaves the department.'' Are we asked to believe  that
the politicians did not know and are culpable? Who are we  to  believe?  The
SANDF or the joint investigation report?

When  qualified  officials'  advice  is  ignored  and  the  Cabinet  instead
approves of a  vastly  more  expensive  deal,  the  report  finds  that  the
politicians did not do anything wrong. But  when  corruption  occurs  it  is
attributed to the officials. As the politicians  make  the  officials,  they
are fall guys for gross mismanagement, we  are  still  expected  to  believe
that the integrity of the arms deal is intact despite  the  proof  that  the
politicians did not exercise proper control over the process.

During December  2001,  no  less  than  eight  portfolio  committees  tabled
reports on the joint investigation report. It is  now  eight  months  later,
and very little if anything has become of the recommendations mode by  these
committees. A few examples: Have the  two  defence  committees  compiled  an
implementation framework? Have amendments  been  introduced  to  the  Public
Finance Management Act? What happened to the full progress  report  promised
for earlier this year regarding the NIP projects,  broken  down  project  by
project  with  the  benefits  to  be  derived   from   each   project   also
disaggregated into clear categories - investment,  export  earnings,  direct
and indirect jobs? Has Scopa honoured its commitment to  interact  with  the
relevant departments and parastatals to  monitor  proper  implementation  of
recommendations  made  in  the  joint  investigation  report?  As  long   as
recommendations of portfolio committees are not implemented, we  are  making
a mockery of the oversight role  of  Parliament  and  then  we  have  become
victims of the executive's/majority party manipulation. This  threatens  our
democracy.

Due to the reasons mentioned above, the UDM has  decided,  as  a  manner  of
protest, not to support any of the eight portfolio committee reports  before
this House today. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam  Speaker,  this  matter  has  been
debated in this House before and, as  we  have  seen,  it  was  very  widely
commented on  in  many  different  areas.  As  Government,  we  have  to  be
realistic and accept that those who are  opposed  to  the  purchase  of  the
arms, and those who see it as their sole purpose in life to oppose  anything
this Government does, will try to ensure that we will  have  no  closure  on
this matter.

What I find somewhat distasteful,  Madam  Speaker,  although  I  accept  the
Chair's ruling that we should not comment on the constitutional  structures,
is just the fact  that  certain  individual  members  somehow  seem  to  see
themselves as paragons of virtue. What they cannot seem to  accept  is  that
fact is not what I say is right.

I also find it extremely distasteful that persons  make  a  long  string  of
allegations here in the House, but are not prepared  to  subject  themselves
to the scrutiny of the investigation. I think this is  sad  but,  more  than
that, I think it is indicative of the complete disregard  for  what  we  are
trying to achieve as a nation with our constitutional structures.  It  is  a
very sad day when we experience the events that we did by  certain  speakers
earlier today, and I sincerely hope that their parties will reflect  on  the
wisdom of such actions.

This strategic arms procurement has been subject to close scrutiny  by  this
Parliament and by the institutions and structures  of  both  Parliament  and
the Constitution. What we have to accept,  as  I  have  indicated,  is  that
there are many zealots out there who will  not  accept  anything  unless  it
coincides with their views. I will not seek to respond to such positions  in
this matter.

However, Government has respected and will continue to  respect  the  rights
of many persons who express reservations on  this  defence  procurement.  It
was, and it is, a major decision that utilises  considerable  resources.  If
we look more sensibly, other than the populist appeals,  at  what  has  been
said by many members here, that we  are  doing  away  with  all  the  social
expenditures for arms, then that is not the case. The  evidence  is  against
that, but we are deeply conscious of the fact that when  one  makes  choices
like this - and we made a choice and this House debated  that  choice,  that
we would re-equip our Defence  Force  -  I  believe  that  the  majority  of
persons in this House  would  support  that  decision.  When  we  made  that
decision, we knew we were making choices, but what has become clear  in  the
time since making that decision and in subsequent events, is  that  we  have
not detracted from our social expenditure obligations.

We have been able to meet those obligations and can continue to  meet  those
obligations. I therefore think this is fairly cheap  politics,  to  try  and
claim that we are  ignoring  and  denying  our  social  responsibilities  in
favour of a defence force. All governments - and there is only  one  that  I
am aware of that will eschew any defence force whatsoever - have to  make  a
choice between spending on defence and social expenditure.  I  believe  that
the evidence shows this; the budget reviews are extensive and detailed,  the
expenditure reviews are extensive and detailed. No-one can claim  that  they
do not have enough information to know whether we do  or  do  not  meet  our
social expenditure obligations. We quite clearly do.

As stated time and again, and I wish to state this again on  behalf  of  the
Government and  my  colleagues  in  the  Cabinet,  Government  welcomes  and
continues to welcome the oversight of Parliament and it  must  exercise  its
responsibilities and its obligations. We also welcome the  fact  that  three
essential agencies of our  new  democracy  -  and  this  is  why  it  is  so
distasteful when they are treated in the manner that they  are  -  undertook
extensive investigations. That  investigation,  as  has  been  indicated  by
previous speakers from the ANC, weighed the evidence  and  made  a  finding.
The fact that particular party members  and  individuals,  whose  particular
views have not been borne out and whose political  ambitions  have  possibly
come short, do not like that, cannot be cause to attack  our  constitutional
structures. We must desist from this kind of activity.  That  is  disrespect
for our future.

Let me address a point raised by the very last speaker,  the  hon  Koornhof.
Have we acted on the recommendations made by the findings? And here  I  wish
to speak for the DTI as one of the major departments  with  responsibilities
for a particular and important component of  this  total  package.  We  have
undertaken what we were asked to do. We were asked to ascertain  once  again
whether the performance guarantees would, in fact,  be  effective.  We  have
done that.

We have taken further legal advice. We have given that legal advice  to  the
Auditor-General and gone into it in some detail. The  further  legal  advice
supports  the  findings  of  the  joint  study  in  that  these  contractual
obligations in the form of performance guarantees are  as  effective  as  we
can get and are most certainly in line with best  practice  internationally.
We have asked the Auditor-General during the course  of  his  annual  audit,
and the  A-G  specifically  had  full  access  to  the  National  Industrial
Participation Programme in March this year. We believed  it  to  be  a  very
thorough investigation of what our capacities and procedures were.

I wish to place on record our thanks to the office of  the  Auditor-General.
He found, in general, that our  procedures  were  in  conformance  with  our
obligations  to  monitor  this   process.   He   made   certain   procedural
recommendations as to what we should  do.  We  also  brought  in  a  further
outside accounting firm and asked them to make  further  procedures  and  we
have also introduced a range of administrative  measures  -  new  databases,
new manuals of procedure, new manuals that define conflict of interest,  and
we accept that we had to improve our records  of  decision-making.  We  have
done that.

We  have  upgraded  the  division  dealing  with  this  matter  to  a  Chief
Directorate. The Auditor-General, I think, has also expressed his view  that
this is acceptable. He has thanked us for the information we have given  him
and we will continue to give him that information. The  NIPP,  the  National
Industrial Participation Programme, will also be subject to  regular  audits
by the Auditor-General's office.

The Auditor-General asked us to motivate what the logic was of  substituting
one project with another. Our  argument  is  essentially  that  there  is  a
considerable timespan between proposals being made  for  projects  and  then
being realised. Fundamentally, it is in our  interests  of  maintaining  the
viability and economic sustainability of these projects to  ensure  that  we
adjust  to  changes,  to  market  conditions,  and  therefore   we   believe
substitutability to be an important process. However, that  substitutability
does not reduce the obligations that the suppliers have, and  our  intention
in allowing for these substitutions is to improve the  quality  of  projects
that we achieve through the NIPP.

Contrary to the last speaker's view, we have reported, namely  in  March  of
this  year.  We  gave  a  progress  report  on   the   National   Industrial
Participation Programme. As that report indicated,  we  are  well  ahead  of
schedule in terms of the benchmarks. The first major benchmark is 2004,  but
we are currently well ahead of schedule. These contracts began in  2000  and
we began in the first period to define the  projects,  negotiate  some  very
extensive and detailed projects, and they began to become operational.  And,
as we reported  in  that  report  in  March,  many  of  them  are  currently
operational. During the course of this year others will become operational.

We believe that the range and quality of projects that have come in do  meet
our objective. That objective is to use any major  purchase  by  the  public
sector to support and strengthen  the  industrialisation  process  in  South
Africa and strengthen its manufacturing capacity. When we look at the  range
of investment projects that have come in, we believe  that  we  are  meeting
this obligation.

Now, it  has  been  argued  recently,  using  inaccurate  and  contradictory
information, that many of these projects may have come anyway. Yes,  it  may
also  rain  tomorrow.  People  not  familiar  with  the  competitiveness  of
international investment decisions, I think, may feel that investment  comes
easily. Investment does not come easily and from our point of view we  would
value far more highly projects that actually take place than  projects  that
may have taken place.

A recent example was the gold projects around Harmony in the Free State.  It
really puzzles me and I see it as somewhat of a specious  argument  that  we
would have exported the gold anyway. The  point  that  we  are  making  with
those projects is precisely that we are not  just  exporting  gold,  we  are
exporting beneficiated and processed gold.  The  project  has  a  number  of
components to it. One of those is a facility to manufacture  better  quality
gold in Harmony and therefore  to  make  that  available  to  the  jewellery
industry.

The other aspect, then, is the jewellery industry, where we have brought  in
investors who have access to major markets in the US and elsewhere, to  come
in and begin manufacturing the process. The other  aspects  of  the  project
are new technology, introduced by Mintec, which allows  two  very  important
processes to take place. One  concerns  chemical  products  associated  with
gold production and the other is 99.9% refined gold that can be used  for  a
range of electronic and jewellery purposes.

Finally, we have the jewellery training school, which we  believe  to  be  a
major step forward for an area  like  Welkom,  which  has  been  subject  to
considerable economic decline as a result of the mining  industry.  Now,  to
say that we would have exported the gold anyway and discount the sum  up  to
$9 million US of investment over the  coming  years  really  is  a  specious
argument, which misses the point as to what it is we are trying  to  achieve
with these projects.

The point that we once again wish to make very strongly is  that  there  are
two processes involved  in  this  strategic  defence  procurement.  The  one
process is a  decision  to  re-equip  the  SA  National  Defence  Force,  to
maintain its integrity as a defence force - and my colleague will deal  more
with this. We did that within what we felt would be affordable  figures  for
this economy. Those figures, the estimates, the  amount  of  money  we  have
drawn  down  on  the  foreign  loans,  all  of  these  figures  are  in  the
expenditure review and the budget review. So I  am  not  going  to  re-enter
this whole issue of what the costs are. The costs  are  visible  to  all  as
they proceed and unfold. Everyone can make their  own  calculation  and  see
what is happening. Everyone can see that, contrary to the  predictions,  the
budget position is not worse and that it has improved.

So, the risk factors that were rightly considered at the time thus  far  are
not eventuating. It was for this reason, that these risks  were  not  there,
that we agreed to the second tranche, but we can monitor these risks  as  we
go along. So, the dire predictions of what would happen to our  budget  have
not happened.

However, that decision to re-equip the SA National Defence Force was  taken,
like any other decision by any public sector entity, where  the  procurement
will result in more than $10 million US  imported  content.  It  immediately
becomes liable to the NIPP, where they must meet a minimum of  30%  of  that
imported content through a range of specified obligations  in  the  domestic
economy. We believe that the  NIPP,  both  its  defence  component  and  its
civilian component, are meeting the objectives that we originally set.

Much has been made of the fact that these were foreign  purchases.  I  think
that anyone who examines the impact on the South  African  defence  industry
of these purchases will see that it has  been  massively  positive.  Without
these projects that have  come  through  by  way  of  the  procurement,  our
defence industry would most certainly have been in much more  dire  straits.
There are many people who would have welcomed that, but  I  think  that  the
majority of South Africans would accept that we need both  a  defence  force
and a defence industry.

Allegations have been  made  in  my  own  department  against  a  particular
individual. We processed those allegations through due process.  We  did  it
following the guidelines and prescriptions of the Public Service Act and  we
carried out that investigation. A finding was made against the individual  -
not a finding of corruption but one of misconduct. The individual  exercised
his right of appeal to myself as Minister.  I  considered  the  matter  once
again and  I  upheld  the  original  decision.  The  individual  then  quite
rightly, because he is a young  person  with  a  future,  exercised  further
rights about a week or two ago. He went for a process of conciliation.  That
process failed and during the course of this month  an  arbitration  process
will take place.

The point I want to make here is that whistle-blowing  and  allegations,  as
was said by the hon Kannemeyer, are one thing. Due  process  and  finding  a
person guilty of any misconduct or criminal conduct must then  be  followed.
We  cannot,  just  because  it  suits  our  political  purpose  or  our  own
predispositions about our opposition to arms, make any  wild  allegation  we
want  to.  We  cannot  come  here,  having  had  an  exhaustive  process  of
investigation with findings made that are public, and then  string  together
a whole lot of other innuendo's and insinuations  about  the  arms  industry
and things that are outstanding. Really, as leaders of  our  people,  should
we not conduct ourselves with more dignity and circumspection?

If allegations are made and are investigated, then the due process  of  law,
or of administrative procedure in the case of my department, must  continue.
Surely, no matter who we are,  as  members  of  Parliament  and  leaders  we
should respect those processes. I do not think we should get  up  and  abuse
Parliament  by  making  all  sorts  of  accusations  against  all  sorts  of
companies as to how rotten and corrupt they are, etc. If we are going to  do
that, we may as well accuse every  major  corporation  in  South  Africa  of
corruption as well. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Don't be naive.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: For a young person like that hon  member
to call me naive is just a little bit thick at times, actually.  [Laughter.]
Where was that hon member when I was learning? [Interjections.]

As I have said, regrettably and for reasons that have little to do with  the
facts, but more with particular emotive feelings  or  particular  individual
sadness that someone's facts were not listened to because  maybe  they  were
not facts, this matter is unlikely to lie down. I am sure it  will  continue
to be raised, because it looks like it is convenient.

However, the truth  of  the  matter  is  that,  contrary  to  the  continued
attempts to be negative and destructive, I believe both this Parliament  and
the agencies of our Constitution have come through  well.  They  have  drawn
our attention to matters where we were  clearly  in  the  wrong,  they  have
drawn our attention to shortcomings in our procedures and they have made  it
clear that we must, in future, conduct ourselves  even  more  professionally
than we attempted to do on this occasion.

That seems to me, for a new democracy coming out of  some  very  opaque  and
dark times - and I do not recall the DA ever disputing  any  arms  purchases
as the DP, but still - coming out of those times, I think we have done  very
well. The Government continues to accept the oversight to exercise. We  have
reported and if we do not implement the recommendations that are made,  then
these hon members will hold us to account.

South Africa does need a defence force, we needed to  re-equip  it,  and  in
the process of re-equipping it we used the leverage that  this  gave  us  to
strengthen South Africa's  industrial  economy,  which  has  to  be  to  the
benefit of our people. [Applause.]
Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, whilst there is  no  smoke  without  a  fire,
concerns about the arms deal are now clearly water under  the  bridge.  This
is a bitter pill that we must swallow. It is now clear that  the  Government
views the arms deal as a closed matter. This does not preclude  people  with
tangible evidence of corruption in this regard from bringing  such  evidence
to light.

If one is to look into the future, as I  suggest,  I  think  lessons  to  be
learnt  from  this  exercise  are  that  we  must  strengthen   Parliament's
oversight role. Chapter 9 institutions, especially,  must  be  strengthened.
Parliament must ensure that these institutions are truly  independent  in  a
discernible manner.

We must exercise greater circumspection when we pass  laws  in  this  House,
especially as far as the prevention of corruption and  fraud  is  concerned.
The alleged approval by the Cabinet of the concept  of  an  inspectorate  to
oversee future arms exports is welcomed. The Department of Defence,  on  its
part, must urgently implement all Scopa recommendations made to it. The  new
acquisition officer will do well to take note of  this.  The  nonfunctioning
of the audit committee since May 2001 in the department is a case in point.

Although it is difficult to find  fault  in  law  with  the  report  of  the
investigators into the arms deal, their conclusions leave a bitter taste  in
one's mouth. I cannot forget the statement of the Public Protector  on  that
occasion when he said there was no evidence of  wrongdoing  by  any  person;
that where it existed, it was not sufficient to  warrant  prosecution.  This
is one of those cases in which a judge would say that  he  or  she  was  not
satisfied that the accused had told the whole truth, but that there  was  no
evidence of guilt and that therefore the accused  was  discharged.  That  is
the arms deal. [Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, die debat gaan  nie  vandag  daaroor
of Suid-Afrika nuwe wapens moet aankoop aldan  nie.  Die  aankopeprogram  is
goedgekeur deur hierdie Parlement, deur al die politieke  partye,  maar  dit
gaan oor die proses wat gevolg is met die aankoop van hierdie wapens.

Die eerste bevinding van die ondersoek  deur  die  Openbare  Beskermer,  die
Ouditeur-Generaal en die Nasionale Direkteur van Openbare Vervolging is  dat
geen bewyse gevind kon word van onbehoorlike of onwettige optrede of  gedrag
van die Regering nie. Soos die Engelse spreekwoord sê: ``We  have  satisfied
our masters; they  are  off  the  hook.  In  dieselfde  bevinding  word  dit
duidelik  gestel  dat  enige  onreëlmatighede   en   onbehoorlike   optredes
toegeskryf word aan sekere amptenare. In Engels noem  'n  mens  dit  eintlik
``blameshifting''.

Met  die  beperkte  tyd  tot  my   beskikking   verwys   ek   net   na   die
korvetteprogram. Die verslag  bevind  in  paragraaf  14.1.10  dat,  met  die
uitsondering van Bazan, nie een van die tenderaars betrokke by  die  korvet-
aankope voldoen het  aan  die  minimum  evaluasiekriteria  ten  opsigte  van
finansies, tegniese vereistes  en  die  verdedigingsnywerheidsdeelname  nie.
Bazan het net die finansiële evaluasie nie geslaag  nie.  Die  verslag  meld
dat ten spyte van die nie-voldoening aan die vereistes, die aanbiedings  van
die tenderaars 'n tweede rondte geëvalueer is. Die  verslag  meld  dat  geen
bewys van die  magtiging  van  sodanige  besluit  gedurende  die  forensiese
ondersoek gevind is nie. By navraag aan die mede- voorsitter van SOFCOM  mnr
Shaik hieromtrent, sê hy dat hy nie  bewus  was  daarvan  dat  nie  aan  die
vereistes voldoen was nie.
Die verslag meld verder eerstens dat Bazan die  enigste  tenderaar  was  wat
aan  al  die  kritieke  minimum  kriteria  ten  opsigte  van   tegniese   en
verdedigingsnywerheids deelname voldoen het.  Tweedens  het  die  Bazan  die
hoogste    punte    behaal    wat     betref     militêre     waardes     en
verdedigingsnywerheidsdeelname. In die derde  plek  het  Bazan  die  hoogste
persentasie - die DIP, soos hulle  sê,  en  NIP  -  in  verhouding  tot  die
kontrakprys behaal. En in die vierde plek het Bazan die laagste prys van  al
vier die tenderaars aangebied.

Maar GFC word genomineer as gekose tenderaar op grond van hulle NIP  aanbod,
ten spyte daarvan dat daar onsekerheid bestaan oor  die  bereiking  van  die
aanbod. Daar is geen twyfel  nie  dat  as  skoon  administrasie,  objektiewe
beoordeling, voldoening aan vereistes en optrede in  die  beste  belang  van
die Weermag gegeld het, Bazan die kontrak moes kry. In die lig van die  feit
dat GFC die kontrak gekry het teen  die  agtergrond  van  voorafgaande,  kan
niemand verkwalik word nie  as  daar  gesê  word  dit  lyk  na  onbehoorlike
bevoordeling onder die tafel deur en blatante korrupsie.

Die Vryheidsfront se standpunt is dat  dit  tyd  geword  het  dat  Ministers
aanspreeklikheid  begin  aanvaar  vir  wat  hulle  amptenare  doen.  Hierdie
``blame-shifting''  moet  gestaak  word.  Die   verantwoordelike   Ministers
behoort te bedank, want hulle het nié hulle werk behoorlik  gedoen  nie,  en
sonder meer voorleggings aanvaar sonder om hulle  behoorlik  op  die  hoogte
van kriteria en vereistes te bring. Dit is die spreekwoordelike  drie  apies
van die Regering wat sê: ``Ek sien niks, ek hoor niks, en ek sê niks  nie''.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, this debate is not  about  whether  South
Africa should buy new arms or not. The programme of acquisition  was  agreed
to by this Parliament, by all the political parties, but this is  about  the
process that was followed with the acquisition of these arms.

In the investigation by the Public Protector, the  Auditor-General  and  the
National Director of Public Prosecution the first finding was that no  proof
could be found of improper or illegal actions or conduct by the  Government.
As the English saying goes: ``We have satisfied our masters;  they  are  off
the  hook''.  In  the  same  finding  it  was  clearly   stated   that   any
irregularities and conduct unbecoming can be imputed to  certain  officials.
In English one actually calls that blame-shifting.

In the limited time at my disposal I must refer to the  corvette  programme.
In paragraph 14.1.10 the report finds that, with  the  exception  of  Bazan,
not one of the tenderers involved with  the  corvette  acquisition  actually
measured up to the  minimum  evaluation  criteria  in  respect  of  finance,
technical requirements and participation in the defence industry. Bazan  did
not pass  the  financial  evaluation.  The  report  mentions  that,  despite
noncompliance with requirements, the presentations  by  the  tenderers  were
evaluated for a second round. The report  mentions  that  no  proof  of  the
authorisation for such  a  decision  could  be  found  during  the  forensic
investigation. Upon enquiry the co-chairperson of Sofcom, Mr Shaik, said  in
this regard that he was unaware of the requirements not having been met.

The report also mentions, firstly, that Bazan was the only tenderer to  meet
all the critical minimum  criteria  in  respect  of  technical  and  defence
industry participation.  Secondly,  Bazan  achieved  the  highest  score  as
regards military values and defence industry participation.  Thirdly,  Bazan
achieved the highest percentage - the DIP, as they say, and  the  NIP  -  in
relation to the contract price. In the fourth  place,  Bazan  had  submitted
the lowest price of the four tenderers.

However, GFC was nominated on the basis of  their  NIP  offer,  despite  the
uncertainty regarding the viability of that offer. There is  no  doubt  that
if clean administration, objective evaluation, compliance with  requirements
and conduct in the best interests of the Defence Force had held good,  Bazan
should have been awarded the contract. In light of the  fact  that  GFC  was
awarded the contract against this background, nobody can be taken amiss  for
saying that this appears to be  improper,  under  the  table  favouring  and
blatant corruption.

The position of the FF is that it  is  high  time  for  Ministers  to  start
taking responsibility for  what  their  officials  are  doing.  This  blame-
shifting must be stopped. The Ministers responsible should  resign,  because
they did not do their work properly by simply accepting submissions  without
acquainting themselves with the  criteria  and  requirements  involved.  The
proverbial three monkeys of the Government are saying: ``Hear no  evil,  see
no evil, speak no evil''. [Interjections.]]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, I want to thank  the  hon  Raenette  Taljaard
and Gavin Woods for just refreshing our memories about the  arms  deal  saga
and I want to agree with every word they said.

Section 217 of the Constitution  requires  that  all  procurement  processes
must  be  done  in  accordance  with  a  system  that  is  fair,  equitable,
transparent, competitive and cost-effective. The arms deal does  not  comply
with  most  of  these  requirements,   especially   cost-effectiveness   and
transparency.

Government has misled this country.  Government  promised  South  Africa  in
1999 that they were going to  invest  R29  billion  and,  in  return,  would
receive R110 billion in investment and create 64 000  jobs.  Why  do  I  say
Government has misled this country? The R29 billion  has  now  increased  to
R53 billion, the R110 billion has decreased to R104  billion  and  the  jobs
from Coega have evaporated into a condom factory. [Laughter.]

Why are we here today? Why are we only debating this publicly today?  If  we
are serious about our  democracy  and  corruption  by  senior  officials  in
Government this report should have been prioritised by  Parliament.  Are  we
building a positive image for our country? No, we are not!

Paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 55(2), as well as  section  92(2)  of  the
Constitution refer to accountability and oversight. With the  arms  deal  we
are experiencing a fusion of  the  executive  and  Parliament  along  party-
political lines. This is in violation of the  separation  of  powers.  Thank
God that we still have an independent judiciary! We place our faith in  this
country  in  the  independent  judiciary  and  not  in  the   executive   or
Parliament. So far Government has lost almost all constitutional  challenges
and I am sure that they are also going to lose the  crossing  of  the  floor
challenge.

The violation of the separation of powers is illustrated today.  In  today's
debate of 165 minutes the ANC has been allocated 64 minutes.  Forty  minutes
have been allocated to Ministers to  come  and  lecture  us  in  Parliament,
instead of Parliament asking the Ministers to come and  account  and  answer
questions. [Interjections.] [Applause.]
Parliament must reflect on this report today - no lectures  from  Ministers!
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mrs P DE LILLE: This makes a mockery of the  oversight  of  Parliament.  The
executive can control members of the ruling party, but we in the  opposition
will not keep quiet. [Interjections.]

Parliament has become  the  lapdog  of  the  executive,  not  the  watchdog!
[Applause.]

Dr R H DAVIES: Madam Speaker, the subject of this debate this  afternoon  is
a series of reports by committees of this Parliament  engaged  in  oversight
about an important transaction in this democratic Government. I am going  to
speak largely to  the  report  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Trade  and
Industry which looked at industrial participation dimensions. The  portfolio
committee has, in fact, tabled two reports on  the  IP  dimensions  of  this
transaction. In addition to the report on the  Order  Paper  today  we  have
also published a report in the ATC on the 20 March  last  year  on  the  job
estimates arising from certain queries put  to  us  by  Scopa  in  its  14th
report.

I also want to confirm, for Dr Koornhof's benefit, that the  committee  did,
in fact, receive a  more  detailed  report  which  we  asked  for  from  the
department. This was tabled in a portfolio committee meeting in  March  this
year and I have it with me now. Perhaps the hon member wants to get  it  and
he will not vote against our report when it comes to voting.

There is a  good  deal  of  confusion  about  the  industrial  participation
component and some of it was displayed in the remarks of Patricia  De  Lille
just now. I think I therefore need to clarify a few points. The first  point
which I think she has missed is that the case for  or  against  the  defence
programme rests fundamentally on its merits as  a  programme  for  equipping
the Defence Force to meet  the  country's  needs  in  the  context  we  find
ourselves in.

The industrial participation,  the  NIPs  and  the  DIPs,  may  arise  as  a
secondary  reconsideration.  Government  policy  requires  any   procurement
abroad  valued  at  $10  million  or  more  to  be  subject  to   industrial
participation negotiations, which seek to  use  the  procurement  to  secure
investment benefits for the country.

The second point of confusion, I think, is about the basis on which the  job
estimates were calculated. As we pointed out in the report  we  tabled  last
year, there never were going to be 65 000 jobs created in the  NIP  and  the
DIP projects. If this was understood as 65 000  jobs  existing  all  at  one
time in the various project programmes provided for under the DIPs  and  the
NIPs, then anyone who thought in this way  simply  did  not  understand  the
basis of the calculation. The 65 000, in fact, refers to  direct  jobs  that
will be created both in the construction and  the  implementation  phase  of
the projects and also  the  indirect  jobs  that  will  be  created  in  the
upstream and downstream sectors of our economy as a result of the impact  of
these projects.

The direct jobs will consist of  jobs  both  in  the  construction  and  the
projects per se. It will, therefore, be both  temporary  and  permanent.  It
will be created along a 15-year time span that will therefore not all  exist
at one time. For example, the construction jobs will end,  once  the  plants
are built, and before most of the project jobs will be created.

In the report we submitted last year, our  committee  recommended  that  for
purposes of monitoring and oversight the focus should be  on  the  estimates
of the direct jobs which will tackle some 15 000 over the  period  to  2013.
Likewise, there was never going to be investment of  R100  billion  in  this
economy. That total refers to credits which will be  awarded  to  obligators
which will consist of both investments and exports.

As our report that we heard  in  March  clearly  indicated,  the  investment
obligations of the five defence contracting companies are, in  fact,  around
$3,8 billion while the export obligations are in the region of 9,5  billion.
The IP obligators all have to discharge these obligations over a  period  of
time and milestones at three,  five  and  seven  year  intervals  have  been
agreed with these obligators. The first such milestone is due to be  reached
in the year 2003-04, and I think when some of these details  are  understood
it becomes possible for us to establish some  serious  criteria  to  monitor
the extent to which the IP programmes are or are not on track.
Let me state at this point as our committee's reports have  repeatedly  made
clear. We agree that the IP obligations are an important part of  the  value
for money of this strategic defence procurement programme and it is  clearly
in the interest of our country to ensure that they are carried out and  that
the obligators do not resort to the penalty  clauses  for  nonimplementation
by the obligators.

In our reports this is the picture we have received. Last year we were  told
that 13 of the the total of 70 projects have commenced and at around  2  000
direct jobs have been created or sustained as a result, compared to a  total
of 15 000 direct jobs that is estimated will  be  created  over  a  contract
period. I do not think that is one minor condom factory,  that  is  quite  a
few jobs and compared to the milestones it indicates progress.

Earlier this year we were told that projects approved by the  Department  of
Trade and Industry which were active were expected to  generate  credits  in
terms of investment and export  earnings  of  $6  billion  compared  to  the
target for the first milestone in 2003-04  of  3,98  billion.  Recent  press
reports have questioned the basis on which some of these credits  have  been
awarded and the validity of some of  these  projects  and  the  substitution
that has taken place on  some  of  the  original  projects.  Minister  Erwin
addressed some of these matters earlier and I am sure that these are  issues
which, as part of our oversight work in the committee, we would want  to  go
through in more detail later on.

But what I want to state  here  very  clearly  this  afternoon  is  that  no
serious evidence has been placed before the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Trade
and Industry, even though we have opened up to public hearings and  we  have
heard from a variety of views which have pointed to the IP programmes  being
in any way a scam or a sham or a  mere  delusion  of  the  public  of  South
Africa. Those who have made such charges, and we  have  such  people  before
us, have all been against the  arms  procurement  per  se.  They  have  also
generally argued, as Ms Taljaard did earlier on,  largely  by  reference  to
other experiences or to allegations about inherent corruption  in  the  arms
industry per se. No serious evidence has been  presented  to  our  committee
which has presented a case which has contradicted the  basic  picture  which
is that the milestones are, broadly speaking, being  complied  with  and  at
this early stage, the IP programmes are on track.

More importantly, the IP dimension was subject to thorough investigation  by
the investigating agencies. The main recommendation of Chapter 12  which  we
were asked to look into was that legal opinion be obtained.  We  have  heard
from the Minister just now that  that  legal  opinion  has,  in  fact,  been
obtained. Swift action was also taken against an official in the  department
who is alleged to have been involved in misconduct. All other cases are  now
subject to appeal.

Beyond  this  our  report  actually  argued  that  the  real  issue  is  not
necessarily fundamentally only  a  question  of  legal  contracts.  Ensuring
effective implementation of IP projects both those related to the  strategic
defence procurement and those arising from other procurements is a  function
of much more than controls in contracts. It also  depends,  and  perhaps  is
even more critically dependent on follow-up actions by  Government  and  the
DTI in particular, interacting with contractors and creating the  conditions
for the IP projects  to  go  ahead.  This  includes  working  together  with
contractors to identify locations for projects  to  generate  infrastructure
services and to provide other services on a similar basis as those  provided
to other investors. In other words, all of this relates  to  broader  issues
of investment policy and industrial strategy.

Let me say that the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Trade  and  Industry  remains
committed to maintaining oversight over these IP projects.  We  do  consider
that these are important programmes and we will continue  to  interact  with
the department. Where there are genuine cases of real  serious  evidence  of
problems we will take them up and if necessary we will refer them  to  other
agencies to investigate. I think that at  this  point,  though,  the  report
that we have to give is that these projects are  broadly  on  track  and  I,
therefore, commend our report and I hope that Dr Koornhof will vote  for  it
as well. [Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Madam Speaker, our view  in  respect  of  the  Government's
dealings in the arms deal is  simply  this:  It  is  a  disgrace!  It  is  a
disgrace due to a lack of accountability of  the  executive  to  Parliament;
unashamed intimidation of members of Scopa; a  reckless  disregard  for  the
recommendations by the various committees  as  to  the  joint  investigative
report; as well as a total lack of transparency displayed by the  Government
in respect of its dealings in the arms deal.
The DA regards today's  debate  as  an  attempt  to  whitewash  any  further
discussion of this topic as well as a blatant attempt to limit  any  further
damage to the executive. The lack of transparency is  clearly  indicated  by
the fact that the public today does not know what  the  total  cost  of  the
arms deal will be. Apparently, it will be  double  the  R57,4  billion  made
public.

Let me illustrate to hon members a few of the consequences  of  this  highly
undesirable deal. First, there was the  resignation  of  the  hon  Mr  Gavin
Woods  as  chairperson  of  Scopa.  Second,  his  detailed  study   of   the
procurement, citing more than 50 irregularities, is a  clear  indication  of
the Government's bungling in this matter.  Third,  the  resignation  of  the
ANC's chief whip Mr Tony Yengeni and his subsequent prosecution in  a  court
of law for allegedly receiving 47% discount on a luxury Mercedes  Benz  4x4,
hence the reference to all ANC leaders as wabenzis!

Fourth, the resignation of former arms acquisition chief Chippy  Shaik  came
about in April this  year  after  disciplinary  steps  had  been  taken  for
disclosing confidential information. Fifth,  his  brother  Shabir  Shaik  is
also on  trial  at  present  for  the  possession  of  confidential  Cabinet
documents,  including  minutes  concerning  the   arms   deal.   Sixth,   an
investigation  was  launched  into  the  financial  affairs  of  the  former
Minister of  Defence,  Mr  Joe  Modise.  Seventh,  a  court  case  has  been
instituted against the Government by Dr Richard Young from the company  C2I2
relating to the corvette deal.

Eighth, another case against Government has been instituted by the  Economic
Alliance for Arms Reduction in order to have the arms deal  cancelled.  This
is done on the basis that, owing to  the  lack  of  financial  prudence  and
other social contractual obligations, Government is not  in  a  position  to
financially afford the arms deal. Ninth, we had the resignation of the well-
respected ANC member of Scopa Mr Andrew Feinstein, and his resignation  from
Parliament, after internal party pressure became unbearable.

Tenth, the arms deal, totalling 41% of the total budget  of  the  Department
of Defence, has led to a critical shortage  of  funds  with  regard  to  its
operating expenses. Not only is  the  reserve  force  in  a  state  of  near
collapse, but it is also taking its toll on the  regular  forces.  Eleventh,
strong and damning criticism is to  be  found  in  the  joint  investigative
report itself.
The Joint Investigating Team found that contract  bidders  were  allowed  to
supply further information after offers  had  been  submitted,  a  deviation
from proper procurement  practice.  Furthermore,  variancies  from  standard
procurement practices were reported in a  special  review  of  the  Auditor-
General. On page 62 of the report it is stated that  neither  the  Hawk  nor
Gripen systems  as  offered  by  BAE  during  its  formal  response  to  the
acquisition satisfied the full  requirement  specifications.  Both  aircraft
systems were by far the most expensive options in their respective classes.

Even worse, according to page 69 of the  report,  the  aircraft  systems  on
offer in the British proposal did not comply with  the  defined  operational
and logistical  requirements  of  either  the  fighter  or  fighter  trainer
programmes. In terms  of  the  department's  own  standards,  thus,  totally
unsuitable aircraft were purchased. With  regard  to  the  decision  by  the
executive to proceed with the special defence procurement on  the  basis  of
industrial  participation,  page  99  of  the  report  contains   the   next
meaningful paragraph:


  ... it was the contention of the committee that industrial  participation
  can never be used to justify a decision to purchase any equipment.

The following paragraph, however, was contained  in  a  memorandum  dated  7
September 1998 and addressed to the Chief  of  Acquisitions  by  the  former
Secretary of Defence:


  ... the Hawk is not the best option from a military point  of  view.  The
  fact  that  its  acquisition  cost  would  solicit   substantially   more
  industrial participation apparently carries the day.

The lack of logic of this decision is quite clear. In most  other  countries
this issue would probably have brought the Government to its knees.

Mr P J GOMOMO: Madam Speaker, when the Auditor-General established  in  1998
that the defence procurement process was a high risk area that  warranted  a
review, this House did not hesitate to facilitate  that  such  a  review  be
conducted, and it has been as a  result  of  processes  emanating  therefrom
that we are debating the report today of the three agencies commissioned  to
further probe the matter.

I want to stress, right at this point, that the very fact  that  this  House
resolved to approve such an investigation  is  an  indication  that  we  are
committed  to  transparency  and  public  accountability   as   pillars   of
democracy.  Those  who  are  making  arguments  in  this  manner  which  are
contrary, know that they have either  been  part  of,  or  worked  with  the
apartheid regime that treated defence-related issues as secret  services  to
be manipulated and to perpetuate the status quo then. They know that  it  is
a major leap forward for us firstly to have dealt with  the  Defence  Review
and, subsequently, the procurement process review  in  the  manner  that  we
did.

We know it is a fact that those people are not proud about  the  revelations
of the past as reality digs through  the  pile  of  their  wrongdoing  which
would  otherwise  have  been  concealed  in  the  secret  documents  of  the
apartheid-era manipulation, as they know that  such  secrets  would  explain
exactly what they are. Today they are opening their big mouths and  want  to
manufacture  serious   offences   against   those   who   commissioned   the
investigation into the  arms  procurement  package.  They  are  looking  for
loopholes, regarding the dealings of  a  complex  procurement  process  like
this, to suggest that the ANC Government  is  corrupt.  What  do  they  know
about corruption to start with?

As  the  leading  party  of  this  House  and  the  champion  of  democratic
internationalism, the ANC  is  not  afraid  of  being  scrutinised  in  this
operation. We are here to  explain  that  to  this  House  and  the  broader
public. In fact, the debate on this issue is not about whether or not  there
has  been  corruption  in  the  manner  Government  dealt  with   the   arms
procurement process, as  that  has  been  cleared  by  the  three  agencies.
However, those people who today want  to  pose  as  people's  champions  are
taking advantage of the challenges that are  confronting  this  country  and
are dealing with those issues in such  an  opportunistic  manner  so  as  to
score cheap political  points.  They  know  that  they  have  destroyed  the
economy of this country and that it will take time to rebuild it to be  able
to create jobs for all, and yet they  suggest  that  the  arms  deal  is  an
obstacle.

In  dealing  with  the  irregularities  identified  in  the   selection   of
subcontractors the Portfolio Committee on Public Service and  Administration
associated itself with the recommendation of the three agencies  and  put  a
rider that, as they are being implemented, care should be taken  that  there
is no conflict with the existing  policies  as  failure  to  do  that  could
easily lead to duplication, and could  easily  be  construed  as  suggesting
that the ANC Government does not  have  policies  to  deal  with  issues  of
conflict of interest and related instances.

On the basis of the understanding that we have a code of conduct  in  place,
in terms of which public servants know what is expected of them  to  do  and
not to do in the the course of doing  their  duties.  We  suggested  in  our
report the fact that the Department of  Defence  should  work  closely  with
that of Public Service and Administration  in  dealing,  particularly,  with
personnel auditing. We  were  doing  so  simply  to  ensure  a  co-ordinated
approach in the implementation  of  the  existing  policies.  We  know  that
despite all the clarifications we can give to this  House  and  the  public,
and also the fact that we allowed the  law  to  take  its  course  on  those
individuals whose conduct in the process warranted such  moves,  there  will
always remain those people who will still want to argue  that  we  have  not
done enough.

The findings of the recommendations of the three agencies came  as  a  shock
to those individuals, and some parties in this House, in that  the  agencies
could not find corruption on the part of the  Government,  hence  they  view
the arms deal as an obstacle. Of course, we should not be understood  to  be
suggesting that  the  probe  was  not  necessary.  We  should  also  not  be
understood to be suggesting that the findings  and  recommendations  of  the
three agencies can simply be brushed aside as useless,  hence  the  decision
by the public service portfolio committee that they should be implemented.

In fact, as responsible members of  this  House  and  as  the  public  would
expect us to be, we all should be asking the executive  how  far  they  have
gone in the implementation of the recommendations of the various  committees
of this House since the tabling of the  report  of  the  three  agencies.  I
think it is a belated argument for any one  of  us  to  participate  in  the
debate in a manner that suggests that it was not necessary to initiate  this
procurement.

We want to put on record that this House and  the  public  should  note  and
realise that issues of defence are as important as it is necessary  to  take
them into serious consideration and that the arms procurement, which we  are
debating today, is one of the steps our Government saw  necessary  to  take.
It should also be noted that the decision to purchase arms is not  the  only
issue Government is doing. Our service delivery  record  speaks  for  itself
and we should all be proud about that and not take advantage of  challenges,
but we should rather bring together our efforts to address.

Of course, we are not claiming complacency  in  the  policies  we  have.  To
start with, we are proud to say that the challenges that confront all of  us
today are those of  policy  implementation.  So  issues  such  as  technical
omissions in the process of policy implementation should not compromise  our
good policies and turn our service delivery record into a  circus.  To  this
end we welcome the anticorruption strategy in the  Public  Service  and  the
anticorruption Bill which is being considered by this House.  We  are  doing
all this because we are committed to transparency, clean governance as  well
as public accountability, and we shall continue to do so whether  those  who
are selective about their support are with us or against.

Ingangabiyiyo  inxina,  kodwa  ingeyiyo  xibhiya   nje   ngamasi.   Siyi-ANC
kwicandelo endijongene nalo, sithi siyaneliseka  yile  ngxelo  neziphakamiso
zayo. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [As the ANC and the department for  which  I  work,  we
welcome and support this report and recommendations thereof. [Applause.]]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, South Africa can be categorised as an  emerging
market. Our currency has been very volatile over the  past  12  months.  The
Myburgh  investigation  regarding  exchange  control  allegations  cost  the
taxpayer approximately R15 million. What is significant,  however,  is  that
the Reserve Bank  and  other  role-players  were  cleared  of  transgressing
exchange control allegations. I agree that allegations regarding  monitoring
of exchange control must be investigated, but it was a very, very  expensive
exercise. It was transparent, however.

When we come to the present arms  procurement  deal,  a  number  of  factors
cannot be divorced from  the  arms  procurement  deal  as  such.  First  and
foremost, South Africa is a country with  an  alarming  incidence  of  Aids.
Secondly, poverty and unemployment of 35% is serious cause for  concern.  It
was reported in the press that the army has  only  a  handful  of  operating
tanks and  that  a  third  proportion  of  our  military  personnel  can  be
categorised as overweight and unfit.

When the very expensive  procurement  deal  was  agreed  upon  in  1999,  it
started as a South African Marshall Plan. It was mentioned that foreign  arm
firms involved like the likes of BAE systems, the manufacturers of the  Hawk
fighter, would pour cash into civilian investment. Regrettably, not many  of
those proposals have  materialised.  BAE  has  bought  into  Denel  but  the
question remains: Do we really need a variety of very sophisticated arms?

Allow me to refer to David Leigh, The Guardian's investigations editor,  who
wrote on 17 July 2002 that a  cheaper  Italian  MB  339  fighter  plane  was
recommended by South African senior officials because the cost of  the  Hawk
would be twice that of the MB 339 fighter plane. The reason given  was  that
the  acquisition  costs  of  the  Hawk   would   solicit   more   industrial
participation from BAE.

Industrial participation  and  foreign  direct  investment  is  of  national
importance - BAE undertook a £270  million  scheme  to  make  power  station
parts and a £93 million titanium plant. According to  my  information,  none
of these undertakings have materialised.

According to The  Guardian,  BAE  has  been  granted  11  years  during  the
delivery life of the arms contract to make good all its  Hawk  promises.  It
is of the utmost importance that foreign arms firms reciprocate with  direct
foreign investment that will create sustained employment opportunities.

As a regional power and founding member  of  Nepad,  South  Africa  needs  a
strong and able defence force to  protect  our  boundaries  and  territorial
coastal areas.

Vroeër in my toespraak het ek melding gemaak van die Myburgh  Kommissie  van
Ondersoek rakende  valutatransaksies.  Toenemende  globalisasie  vereis  dat
alle saketransaksies op 'n deursigtige wyse geskied.

'n Ontstellende veranderlike rakende die wapenaankope is dat  daar  ernstige
bewerings gemaak word teen 'n aantal individue wat hulle sou skuldig  gemaak
het  aan  onaanvaarbare   internasionale   besigheidstransaksies.   Dit   is
gebiedend noodsaaklik dat alle bewerings getoets word, want die  stabiliteit
van ons  geldeenheid  en  ons  langtermyn  ekonomiese  voortuitgang  is  nou
gekoppel   aan   internasionaal   aanvaarbare   etiese   besigheidspraktyke.
Buitelandse   beleggingsvertroue   kan   maklik    geskaad    word    indien
makrososioekonomiese faktore soos privatisering van staatsbates, 'n vrye  en
regverdige regbank en  individuele  menseregte  nie  aangespreek  word  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

Earlier in my speech I made mention of the  Myburgh  Commission  of  Inquiry
into foreign exchange transactions. Increasing globalisation  requires  that
all business transactions take place in a transparent manner.

A disturbing variable  concerning  the  arms  purchases  is  the  fact  that
serious allegations are being made against a number of individuals  who  are
ostensibly  guilty  of  performing   unacceptable   international   business
transactions. It is absolutely vital that all of the allegations be  tested,
because the stability of  our  monetary  unit  and  our  long-term  economic
prosperity  are  closely  linked  to  internationally   acceptable   ethical
business practices. Foreign investor confidence  can  easily  be  harmed  if
macro-socioeconomic factors such as privatisation of state  assets,  a  free
and fair judiciary and individual human rights are not addressed.]

Mr K A MOLOTO: Madam Speaker, in the course of  our  deliberations  on  this
report in the Portfolio Committee  on  Finance  interesting  recommendations
and findings came out that will be useful to spell out.

According to the joint investigation report,  the  costs  of  the  strategic
defence package presented before Cabinet on 18  November  1998  amounted  to
R29,7  billion.  The  report  also  indicated  that  this  amount   excluded
financing costs, amounting to 49% of the  procurement  costs.  According  to
the report, these figures did not include items such as  freight  insurance,
taxes, project management costs, financing costs and loan premiums.

On 18 November 1998 the Cabinet then established  the  International  Offers
Negotiating Team - the IONT - with the  brief  to  negotiate  an  achievable
funding arrangement and an affordable package with the identified  preferred
suppliers.  The  IONT  was  constituted  by  appointed  members   from   the
Departments of Finance, of Defence, and of  Trade  and  Industry,  and  from
Armscor.
An affordability team, which is part of the IONT, was established after  the
Ministers' committee meeting in March 1999. The affordability  team  engaged
in a comprehensive analysis of the economic, fiscal and financial impact  of
the procurements on the country. It used  the  macroeconomic  model  of  the
Bureau for Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosh  to  test  and
develop  alternative  scenarios  for   consideration   by   the   Ministers'
committee.

On  31  August  1999,  an  affordability  report   was   compiled   by   the
affordability team. They reported that the total cost of the package, at  an
estimated forward exchange rate,  was  R36,4  billion.  The  report  further
stated that the full cost was now significantly  higher  than  the  original
amount presented to Cabinet.

According to the report, one of the most significant increases was the  rise
in the purchase of the Lead-In Fighter Trainer, referred  to  as  Lift,  and
the Advanced Light Aircraft, referred to as Alfa. The price rose from  R15,6
billion to R19,6 billion, R4 billion more than the  R15,6  billion  approved
by the Cabinet on 18 November 1998.

On 25 November 1999, Cabinet approved an amount of  R30,2  billion  for  the
entire package exclusive of financing costs. The contracts were signed on  3
December 1999. Certain cost-containing changes were effected  that  differed
from the original decision of Cabinet on 25  November  1999.  These  changes
came as a result of the affordability report. Some of the important  changes
included the following.

The number of light utility helicopters was reduced  from  40  to  30.  This
resulted in a decrease in cost  from  R2,4  billion  to  R1,9  billion.  The
implementation cost of R176,3 million for light  utility  helicopters  would
have to be included into the normal SA Air Force operating budget,  as  this
amount was excluded in the presentation to Cabinet on 15 September 1999.

There was the omission of the purchase of maritime helicopters estimated  by
the affordability team. It appears from an answer given by the  Minister  of
Defence in Parliament that the SANDF would buy these  helicopters  and  that
delivery would be at the same time as the corvettes.  It  appears  that  the
cost of the maritime helicopters will  be  carried  by  the  budget  of  the
SANDF, outside the amount agreed to by the Cabinet  that  is  attributed  to
the special defence account.

The purchases of Lift and Alfa  were  separated  into  three  phases  called
tranches. There is an option to cancel or acquire tranche  2  in  2003,  and
tranche 3 in 2005. This decision was made because  of  the  unpredictability
of the foreign exchange rates and economic  growth  over  a  10  to  15-year
period. This approach affords Government  the  opportunity  to  revisit  the
issue of affordability of the total fighter aircraft requirement at a  later
stage if economic conditions deteriorate.

However, the comments of the Chief  of  the  Air  Force  need  to  be  taken
seriously. The Chief of the Air Force  stated  that  there  was  a  risk  in
reducing the number of aircraft available to train pilots. It was  indicated
that the dual-seater Gripen does not have the full operational  capacity  of
the single-seater and that it does not have the  same  deterrent  value.  It
was also indicated that  without  the  delivery  of  the  second  and  third
tranches, the operational fighter capability of the SANDF would be  severely
limited after 2010. The decision by  Government  to  reduce  the  number  of
aircraft despite the statements by the Chief of the SA Air Force  indicating
that this reduction may impact on the strength of the Air Force, is a  clear
indication of Government commitment to  balance  the  demands  of  a  modern
defence force with affordability constraints.

Some of the essential functionalities of the aircraft in the Lift  and  Alfa
packages were removed during the negotiation  phase,  and  their  cost  will
have to be accommodated  outside  the  Cabinet-approved  package,  as  these
costs were not submitted to Cabinet. The Chief of the  Air  Force  indicated
that ``the Lift and Alfa aircraft  are  a  system  in  terms  of  the  total
systems management approach. This means that  any  scenario  that  does  not
include all the components of the system cannot be supported.''

The  joint  investigating  team  estimates  that  the  inclusion  of   these
functionalities would amount to R1,1 billion. It is uncertain whether  these
functionalities are to be reincorporated or not. These costs  will  have  to
be carried ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon members! Would you please lower  your  voices
so that we can hear the speaker.

Mr K A MOLOTO: These costs will have to be  carried  outside  the  strategic
defence account.

The  leases  of  the  simulator  equipment  of  the  Hawk  and  Gripen  were
transferred from Tranches 2 and 3 to a full purchase  agreement  in  Tranche
1. The costs of the Hawk and Gripen in Tranche 1 are therefore  respectively
35% and 34% higher than the average cost. This would represent  an  implicit
cost of about R1,7 billion should Government exercise its option to  cancel.
This effectively means that cancellation has its own costs.

In view of  the  fact  that  certain  cost-containing  measures  had  to  be
introduced once the affordability report found that not all costs  had  been
submitted to Cabinet in November 1998, and that some of  these  costs  might
have to be funded outside of the package  finally  approved  by  Cabinet  in
1999, the JIT made two key recommendations which are fully endorsed  by  the
committee.

Recommendation 1 states, and I quote:


  Detailed and accurate information, including all possible  costs,  should
  be  submitted  to  Cabinet.  All  currency  risk  implications  regarding
  international armaments acquisitions should be disclosed to Cabinet. Such
  information is necessary to ensure that essential functionalities are not
  removed from aircraft during negotiations due to budget constrains.

Recommendation 2 states, and I quote:


  Proper consultation and an impact study should be done  before  equipment
  types or functionalities are reduced.

The committee further  recommends  that  amendments  be  introduced  to  the
Public  Finance  Management  Act  that  ensure  not  only  that   the   cost
implications of legislation brought before Cabinet and Parliament  be  fully
spelt out, but that the affordability of all major purchases by  Government,
including all financing costs and the potential risks, be made  known  prior
to any formal decisions being taken. The role of  Parliament  in  this  case
needs to be clearly specified.

Furthermore,  the  committee  recommends  that  affordability   reports   be
finalised prior to the finalisation of purchase negotiations. The  committee
also wishes to endorse the following further recommendations of the JIT.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, if we all  speak  aloud  it  clearly
becomes too noisy. Could you rather whisper. I am not saying that  you  must
not continue to talk to each another, but whisper, please.  Please  proceed,
hon member.

Mr K A MOLOTO: The recommendations are as follows, and I quote:


  It  should  be  prescribed  that  all  procurement  processes,  including
  negotiations with preferred bidders, are properly documented to ensure  a
  proper audit trail.

The recommendations go further to state that:


  The  Department  of  Finance  should  take  steps  to  ensure  that  good
  procurement practices  are  adhered  to  and  that  compliance  with  the
  prescribed tender procedures is strictly controlled.

In addition, the committee also endorses the recommendation of  the  JIT  in
paragraph 3.4, which states, inter  alia,  that:  ``The  staff  of  DoD  and
Armscor involved in procurement should be properly trained  to  ensure  that
they assimilate and fully  understand  the  policy  with  the  view  to  its
effective implementation.''

Paragraph 8.13.3 states that: ``An approved negotiation strategy  and  terms
of  reference  should  be  in   place   prior   to   the   commencement   of
negotiations.''

The committee is aware that Government is preparing to overhaul  its  entire
procurement  policies  and  recommends  that  the   shortcomings   of   this
particular arms procurement process be fully identified and analysed with  a
view to rectifying them in the reforms that are to be adopted.

Finally, from my macro point of  view,  the  committee  takes  note  of  the
statements made by the Director-General  of  Finance  to  the  effect  that,
although the loans are mainly in foreign currency denominations,  the  total
foreign debt exposure of South Africa is still very low and does not  exceed
10% of total debt. Therefore, there is hardly any  risk  of  severe  foreign
debt exposure. Secondly, the projected  fiscal  deficit  of  2,6%  is  still
scheduled to remain on track at the same level.

The committee notes that there are a number of provisions  for  the  regular
update ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, I think it is perhaps historic  that
a debate of this nature is taking place in our national Parliament,  in  the
wake of the launch of  the  African  Union.  Precisely  because  that  event
presents this country with significant challenges in the  period  that  lies
ahead.

In July of this year Mr Graham Hosken wrote in the Daily News:


  Heavily armed pirates targeting cargo ships along the African  coast  are
  raking in billions of dollars in trade on the international black market.
  Last year, 97 ships were attacked on Africa's coastline, more  than  half
  of the vessels attacked throughout the world. Most of the  attacks  occur
  either in waters above Angola or Mozambique. There  have  been  very  few
  pirate attacks in South African waters because of the strong presence  of
  the country's navy and water and border police.

The South African coastline  is  approximately  2  800km  long;  it  is  our
longest frontier. Our exclusive economic zone reaches out at 370km  to  sea;
this is the area the SA Navy is expected  to  defend.  The  huge  volume  of
trade coming through our ports is  central  to  our  economy.  In  terms  of
tonnage more than 95% of South Africa's imports and exports and over 80%  in
terms of monitory value pass through the country's ports. In peace time  the
SA Navy's  primary  function  is  to  ensure  that  its  seaborne  trade  is
protected.

I make that point  in  order  to  underline  the  fact  that  defence  is  a
necessary  and  unavoidable  expenditure.  Every  nation  rich   and   poor,
industrialised and nonindustrialised must set aside a portion of its  budget
for defence purposes;  it  is  needed  for  a  country's  survival.  Defence
expenditure falls  into  the  same  category  as  safety  and  security  and
correctional services. Governments have to set  aside  a  portion  of  their
budgets to deal with those that transgress the law, to house those who  have
been found guilty by the courts. It has  to  set  aside  money  for  feeding
them, for clothing them, health, etc. But there  are  no  countertrades  for
housing these prisoners, for feeding them and all of that. Defence falls  in
the same category.

Our executive of course acted very wisely, that in acquiring  the  strategic
defence packages, it used that opportunity as well to benefit  the  economy.
Many countries without the capabilities South Africa has would have  had  no
choice but simply to spend the amount of  money,  purely  for  the  sake  of
survival. So defence packages were a bonus for this nation  because  of  the
wisdom of its executive,  endorsed  by  its  legislature,  this  Parliament.
[Interjections.]

It is therefore a distortion to try and twist the  issue  of  the  strategic
defence packages into the issue of offsets. Whether  there  was  someone  to
invest in our economy or not we would still have had to  purchase  equipment
to defend our country. We would do that. [Applause.]

Now having made that point, I wish to proceed. The events leading up to  the
joint investigation, have been well covered by  previous  speakers  in  this
House this afternoon. And I do not wish to belabour the issue,  but  let  me
highlight a few points in this regard.  The  principle  of  transparency  in
government  and  more  specifically  of  transparency  in   acquisition   of
armaments for the safety of the country was introduced by  this  Government,
not the previous government, but this one. The transparency which  made  the
process of this arms acquisition, that  transparency  was  also  a  creative
initiative of this Government.

For the first time even our white counterparts, who were supposed  to  enjoy
democratic rights before this Government came to power, could not have  been
in a position to even say the things they say today. The process leading  to
the review of the acquisition of these armaments that we are  talking  about
today, was initiated by the  collaboration  between  the  Ministry  and  the
Office  of  the  Auditor-General.  It  was  not  the  opposition  that   was
responsible and that did these things, it was the executive.

And I think it is important to keep that in mind, because an  impression  is
unwittingly being created that this is a Government that does  not  want  to
be accountable; that is hiding something. In fact, this  is  the  Government
that has invited South Africans for the time in the history of this  country
to please look at what we are doing, say your say and  where  we  are  wrong
correct us. This is the Government that has done that. [Applause.]

Up to this point the recommendations from  the  Joint  Investigation  Report
into the Strategic Defence Procurement Packages have been processed  by  the
department and each and everyone of the  recommendations  have  either  been
acted upon or are being acted upon now.  The  reports  by  the  two  defence
committees are important and I would like to talk to their  recommendations.
I will take them as they have been listed.

The chairperson of the portfolio committee  has  spoken  eloquently  on  the
role of Parliament and oversight of the  executive.  Without  this  kind  of
debate and tension between the executive and the legislature there  will  be
no living Parliament and no real oversight. I want to  make  it  very  clear
that the role of Parliament is taken very seriously  by  the  executive  and
the  Department  of  Defence,  and  we  value  it  highly.  As   such,   the
recommendations now follows.

Firstly, this  role  should  be  strengthened  through  the  institution  of
standard operating procedures between the relevant  parliamentary  committee
on defence and the Ministry regarding  the  management  of  any  acquisition
process has been taken on board. Tighter procedures  have  been  drafted  by
the department and we are working towards standard operating  procedures  as
suggested.  Those  also  will  be  made  available  to  the  legislature  to
scrutinise when the right moment comes.

Secondly, the processes around security clearances within  Armscor  and  the
department have already been tightened up. Thirdly,  control  over  internal
documentation and record keeping has also been tightened  up  in  line  with
the recommendations by Parliament.  Fourthly,  in  relation  to  acquisition
policy, a new draft policy has been finalised; if  adopted  this  will  mean
some realignment of the new Armscor Act. In addition on acquisition  policy,
the committees note that foreign defence capabilities were  privileged  over
domestic capabilities and this is not in line with  the  recommendations  of
the Defence Review, which stated that procurement should as far as  possible
attempt to make use of local defence industrial capabilities.

It should be noted that the global trend is that of moving  towards  mergers
and partnerships  within  the  international  defence  industry.  Whilst  we
encourage our local defence industries to develop  -  and,  mark  you,  they
have really advanced since we started - increasingly we  are  entering  into
partnerships with other countries. Given  the  unfortunate  history  of  our
country in which we were isolated, if we are going to be competitive on  the
international market, we also need some strong partners and also  a  balance
between what was ordered and what is needed to produce  a  success  must  be
kept in mind.

Sixthly, Parliament is concerned that there was no  sufficient  feedback  to
Parliament on the drafting of the Armscor Act. We have given  Parliament  so
far two information briefs on this issue. A final draft is  presently  being
tabled in Cabinet and if accepted will be tabled in  Parliament.  The  delay
in the finalisation of this Bill has centred on the final  determination  of
the classification of the public entity. This is in relation to  the  Public
Finance Management Act  and  the  issue  has  to  be  resolved  between  the
Department of Defence and the National Treasury. We are sorting  that  issue
out and we will be coming back to the House with regard to that.

Seventhly, the committee has raised  the  question  of  the  future  of  the
Cheetahs in the light of the acquisition of the Gripens. The operability  of
the Cheetahs expires in the year 2012,  whereupon  they  will  be  used  for
training  purposes  and  then  we  will  phase  them  out.   Eighthly,   the
implications for the SA Air Force operational budget and the impact  on  the
total budget of the  SA  National  Defence  Force  would  be  scheduled  for
discussion with the committees.

Ninethly,  the  plethora  of  structures  cited  by   the   committees   are
cumbersome. We are trying to streamline those structures. We are working  on
that. At the same time we do have to take  account  of  a  hierarchy  and  a
process  of  decision-making.  Tenthly,  conflict  of  interest   has   been
adequately discussed; it needs to be recorded that standard procedures  have
now been institutionalised and that the Department of  Public  Services  and
Administration is putting legislation into place on this  issue.  The  point
is that the Government is responding to what is clearly  a  problem.  It  is
sensitive to criticism and witnesses that are highlighted. But at  the  same
time it is continuing the  process  of  putting  in  place  new  systems  to
strengthen our young democracy. People must understand we did not inherit  a
democratic state. We are putting in place a democratic state and  processes.
[Applause.]

In the eleventh place, the committee recommended that  the  ranking  of  the
post of  Chief  of  Acquisition  should  be  upgraded.  The  post  has  been
advertised and filled as of 1 August this year at  the  level  of  a  deputy
director-general, and I have the privilege  of  introducing  Mr  Ramofolo  -
please, sir, if you may rise - who is now sitting here  with  the  officials
in the House. [Applause.]

Lastly, the committee has recommended investigation into a senior  official,
whose professional behaviour was queried in the  report.  This  is  underway
and where the law has been broken we have started  the  process  of  talking
the matter to court and the law must take its course.

The acquisition of  the  strategic  defence  packages  will  enable  the  SA
National Defence Force to better carry out its ordered tasks. Our  democracy
will best be protected by regional stability and growth, especially  in  the
wake of the launch of the African Union.

The fortunes  of  our  nation  are  as  much  dependent  on  the  successful
implementation of the Nepad programmes as those of  other  African  nations.
Therefore, in the wake of the launch  of  the  African  Union,  the  ensuing
quest and search  for  peace  through  peacekeeping,  peace  support,  peace
creation and enforcement on the continent  will  necessitate  an  unstinting
involvement of our nation  both  at  diplomatic  and  defence  levels.  That
unavoidably is the responsibility which history has placed on  our  nation's
shoulders. We must ready ourselves to fulfil that task.

Consequently when it comes to defence, whether in the ruling  party  or  the
opposition, we must stand as one, bearing in mind  that  the  responsibility
of the country is the collective responsibility of all of us. It  cannot  be
that at times we discourage defence expenditure and when the  following  day
international obligations demands South Africa's participation, we expect  a
National Defence Force that is sufficiently equipped and  ready  to  respond
to ordered missions. I repeat, the SA National Defence Force is ready  today
to fulfil all the ordered obligations both at home and  abroad.  [Applause.]
But after the receipt of the strategic  defence  packages  the  SA  National
Defence Force will be ready to meet all the escalating ordered missions  and
tasks by the President, the executive and the members. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

  ABSTENTIONS - 4: Cassim, M F; Mars, I; Mpontshane, A M; Seaton, S A.

Question agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, before the House adjourns,  I  do  want  to
make a few comments. The views that have been  expressed  in  the  committee
reports will obviously be conveyed as usual to the  executive.  But  we  are
coming to the end of what has been a painful period, in my view, of  debates
in this Parliament. I think that we all need to reflect at the end of  this,
devoid of  party  politics,  and  see  what  the  lessons  are  that  we  as
Parliament are going to learn from this, whichever they are.

Some of these issues will be raised at the  Rules  Committee  that  will  be
meeting, but  I  think  that  each  of  us  has  to  do  that.  We  have  to
systematically address the issues, whether we agree with them or  not,  even
if we do not agree with a particular problem and when we put  it  aside.  It
is incumbent on us to address this and improve whatever systems we have.  We
will await the reports from the executive as well and will take the  process
further. I hope in a way that does not lead to debates not  on  the  issues,
but on allegations about party-political affiliations.

It is incumbent on us as Parliament to address the issues  before  us.  This
is the hope I express to hon members that we do need to  take  forward  from
now onwards.

The House adjourned at 17:20.
