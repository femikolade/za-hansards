                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr T M GONIWE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC celebrated its 90th birthday on 8 January;
  (2) recognises that the ANC throughout its existence has sought to  build
       unity amongst all South  Africans  irrespective  of  race,  religion,
       gender or tribe, to build a nonracial, nonsexist and democratic South
       Africa;


  (3) acknowledges that the ANC is the undisputed leader  of  the  national
       democratic revolution, an example for progressive  forces  throughout
       the world;


  (4) commends the leadership and cadreship of the ANC for its contribution
       to building a caring society  as  it  leads  the  process  of  social
       change;


  (5) congratulates the ANC on its 90th anniversary; and


  (6) looks forward to its centenary in 2012.

[Applause.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the Minister of Social Development has admitted  that  the
       welfare system in South Africa is failing  those  who  need  it  the
       most;


  (2) acknowledges that a  society  which  is  going  to  prosper  must  be
       compassionate towards those who suffer hardships through no fault of
       their own;


  (3) recognises that a  basic  income  grant  would  be  a  simple,  cost-
       effective and affordable mechanism to give subsistence allowances to
       the millions of South Africans who are without any means of support;
       and


  (4) calls on the Government to use tomorrow's Budget Speech  to  announce
       plans for the introduction of such a grant.

Mr J H VAN DER  MERWE:  Mr  Chairman,  I  give  notice  that  I  shall  move
tomorrow:


  That the House -


  (1) takes notice -


       (a)  with much concern, that customer  services  with  South  African
           Airways at airports have deteriorated  to  an  unacceptably  low
           level;


       (b)  that at some airports far too few staff  members  are  on  duty,
           causing long passenger queues and  much  passenger  frustration;
           and


       (c)  that due to unrealistic overbooking of  flights,  even  Business
           Class passengers and Gold Card Voyager members  are  kicked  off
           flights on which they hold  valid  reservations,  causing  those
           unfortunate passengers immense inconvenience and even  financial
           losses; and


  (2) in the best interests of passengers, resolves to -


       (a)  caution passengers against travelling on South African  Airways;
           and


       (b)  advise passengers to rather book with other  carriers,  such  as
           British Airways/Comair, Kulula, Nationwide,  Intensive  Air  and
           East Coast Airlines until such time  as  South  African  Airways
           gets its house in order.

Mrs Z A KOTA: Chairperson, on a point of order: I would like you to rule  on
the motion that has been read from that side.  We  do  not  feel  that  that
motion is parliamentary. The issue of South African Airways has  been  dealt
with as if SAA is an airline with which people are not supposed to  book.  I
think it is unparliamentary.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The procedure  with  motions  is  that
all of them go through the Speaker and she reads through  them.  So,  it  is
only the Speaker that can edit those motions. If it is unparliamentary,  the
Speaker will edit it.

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Chairperson, can it be  noted  that  we  do  not  associate
ourselves with that motion that was tabled. [Interjections.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, in view of the comments,  I  assume  that
Mr Doidge in person agrees with the fact that booked Business and Gold  Card
passengers are kicked off South African Airways.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, this is not a  motion  to
be debated but notice of a motion that was given by Mr  Van  der  Merwe.  If
the motion is out of order, the Speaker will then discuss  the  matter  with
the member who moved the motion.

Mr J H NASH: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that on 9 March 2002 the Republic of Zimbabwe will be concluding
           its sixth general elections; and


       (b)  that it is the duty of all parties involved, but especially  the
           government of Zimbabwe, to ensure that these elections occur  in
           an environment free of  violence,  the  threat  of  violence  or
           intimidation;


  (2) reiterates its commitment to ensuring that  such  an  environment  is
       enhanced and as a token has sent a parliamentary observer  delegation
       to Zimbabwe; and


  (3) calls on -


       (a)  the international community to continue playing an  active  role
           to ensure that the people of Zimbabwe are  able  to  make  their
           choice in an environment of peace and stability; and


       (b)  all Zimbabweans to  participate  in  the  forthcoming  elections
           because in the last instance it is only they who  can  determine
           the future of their country.

It is not for the hon member here to determine. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with growing concern that –


       (a)   prominent  foreign  and  South  African  journalists  were  not
           accredited to cover the elections in Zimbabwe;


       (b)  the  headquarters  of  the  MDC  were  attacked  without  police
           intervention; and


       (c)  four Christian leaders were arrested because they held a  prayer
           meeting for peace;


  (2) agrees with the chairperson  of  SADC,  President  Bakulu  Muluzi  of
       Malawi, that  President  Mugabe  is  jeopardising  the  elections  in
       Zimbabwe, and that SADC should put more pressure on him; and


  (3) notes with alarm that the economic collapse in Zimbabwe could have  a
       disastrous spillover effect on  the  whole  region,  including  South
       Africa.

Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:
  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the decision of the Gauteng Premier to extend the  provision
       of HIV/Aids     treatment to all public hospitals in  that  province,
       despite the Minister of Health distancing herself from his decision;


  (2) condemns  the  shift  of  HIV/Aids  responsibility  by  the  national
       Government to provinces, which is in direct  contravention  of  their
       responsibilities as enshrined in the Constitution;


  (3) calls on -


       (a)  all the  remaining  provinces  to  join  the  campaign,  thereby
           alleviating  the  potential  flock  to  and   overburdening   of
           provinces that do provide treatment; and


       (b)  the national Government to acknowledge their responsibility with
           a clear commitment through money allocated  to  a  holistic  and
           encompassing programme in the Budget.
Ms P N MNANDI: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf  of
the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes President Mbeki's  call  at  the  ANC's  90th  anniversary  for
       volunteers to contribute to the culture of community service;


  (2) recognises  the  outstanding  response  of  thousands  of  volunteers
       throughout the country who worked side by side with parents, teachers
       and students  to  make  the  reopening  of  schools  a  positive  and
       enhancing educational experience;


  (3) commends the President for the personal example he has  set  in  this
       campaign, and all those who participated selflessly and unstintingly,
       and


  (4) calls on all South Africans to join in this campaign to make a better
       life for all in South Africa.

[Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move on behalf  of
the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with -


       (a)  approval the smart sanctions that have been imposed by the EU on
           Zimbabwe, which will see the overseas assets of President Robert
           Mugabe and 19 of his cabinet ministers frozen;


       (b)  relief that the sanctions are designed not to harm the  ordinary
           citizens of Zimbabwe or her neighbours, but those that are  held
           responsible by the EU  for  pre-election  violence  and  serious
           violations of human rights in that country; and


       (c)  great concern that the Zimbabwean government has refused to give
           accreditation to South  Africa's  independent  newspapers,  thus
           raising the question of what they want to hide; and


  (2) therefore calls on our Government to commend the  EU  for  what  they
       have done instead of describing the imposed sanctions as  regrettable
       and unfortunate.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The Freedom  Front!  No,  no,  hold  on.  The
Freedom Front!

Dr S E M PHEKO: I give notice ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order,  hon  member!  Not  yet.  The  Freedom
Front - not the PAC. Order! Unless the PAC has  joined  the  Freedom  Front,
then it is a different story. [Laughter.]

Dr P W A MULDER: We are both proud Africans, but we  are  not  in  the  same
party yet, Sir.

Mnr die Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis  dat  ek  namens  die  VF  by  die
volgende sitting van die Huis sal voorstel:

Dat die Huis daarvan kennis neem dat -


  (1) Die inligting op  naamborde  wat  onlangs  op  die  terrein  van  die
       Parlement  aangebring   is,   om   die   ligging   van   verskillende
       regeringsgebou aan te dui, slegs in een taal, naamlik Engels, is;


  (2) Die VF van mening is dat die Parlement hiermee in stryd  met  Artikel
       6(3)(a) van die Grondwet van Suid-Afrika opgetree het, wat bepaal dat
       die nasionale regering ten minste twee van  die  amptelike  landstale
       moet gebruik;


  (3) In die lig van hierdie gebeure die VF 'n klag by Pansat  gelê  en  'n
       brief aan die Sekretaris van  die  Parlement  gerig  het,  waarin  hy
       versoek word om die saak reg te stel;


  (4) Die VF se voorstel behels dat ten minste vier tale, naamlik 'n Nguni-
       taal, 'n Sotho-taal, Afrikaans en Engels, afwisselend of herhalend op
       die  borde  aangebring  moet  word,  om  sodoende  die  probleem  van
       veeltaligheid bevredigend aan te spreek;


  (5) Die VF hom sal beywer vir die bevordering van veeltaligheid in  Suid-
       Afrika en in hierdie spesifieke geval alle metodes sal gebruik om  te
       verseker dat dit reggestel word, en dat die VF dit verwelkom  wanneer
       dit gebeur.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the information on the signposts which were recently  placed  on  the
       Parliamentary grounds, to indicate  the  location  of  the  different
       government buildings, is in one language only, namely English;


  (2) the FF  is  of  the  opinion  that  by  so  doing  Parliament  is  in
       contravention of section 6(3)(a) of the Constitution of South Africa,
       which determines that national  Government  must  use  at  least  two
       official languages;


  (3) in light of these occurrences the FF lodged a  complaint  at  PanSALB
       and addressed a letter to the Secretary to  Parliament  in  which  we
       request that he rectifies the matter;


  (4) the proposal of the FF entails that at least four languages, namely a
       Nguni language, a Sotho language, Afrikaans and English, be reflected
       on the signposts, alternately or repeatedly to tackle the problem  of
       multilingualism in a satisfactory way; and


  (5) the FF will strive for the  promotion  of  multilingualism  in  South
       Africa and in this specific case will use all the methods  to  ensure
       that this is rectified, and that the FF would welcome  this  when  it
       happens.]

Dr B G MBULAWA-HANS: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the significant improvement in the 2001 matric results, with  a
       success rate of over 60%;


  (2) recognises that disadvantaged schools have made outstanding  progress
       in educating their students;


  (3) acknowledges that this is only a first step in equipping our youth to
       contribute and compete as skilled and productive citizens;


  (4) further recognises that while there are areas in which there is  much
       room for improvement, the number of dysfunctional schools has dropped
       by half;


  (5) congratulates all principals, educators, the departments and learners
       on their success; and


  (6) calls on all South Africans to  contribute  to  the  success  of  our
       school system in whatever way they can.

[Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Mr Chairman, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) is appalled that the three biggest newspaper groups in South  Africa,
       namely Independent Newspapers, Naspers and Johnnic  Publishing,  have
       been refused  accreditation  by  the  Zimbabwean  government  on  the
       ridiculous grounds, according to  a  Zimbabwean  official,  that  the
       independent media are mostly -``liars that fabricate  and  exaggerate
       the news'';


  (2) acknowledges that this is not only an attack on the  freedom  of  the
       press, but also undermines the credibility of the election; and


  (3) suggests that, instead of criticising  the  European  Union  for  its
       action against President Mugabe, the South African Government  should
       make it clear in unambiguous terms to the Zimbabwean authorities that
       this denial of the South African media is unacceptable to it.

[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chair, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes with extreme shock that rail accidents are  fast  becoming  the
       norm in South Africa, as seen in recent accidents in  both  KwaDukuza
       and Eerste River;


  (2) also notes that these accidents  are  purely  human  error  or  greed
       noticeable in those who disobey rail signals or those who  steal  the
       signalling cables on the rail;


  (3) regrets that it has to be pointed out that there is an apparent  lack
       of proper management which should, among  other  things,  ensure  the
       maintenance and safeguarding of these cables on the part of Spoornet;
       and


  (4) therefore appeals  to  Spoornet  to  ensure  that  these  cables  are
       protected in one way or the other, rather than looking  at  accidents
       with hindsight.

Ms T R MODISE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  that  2002  marks  the  5th  anniversary  of  South  Africa's
       democratic Constitution;


  (2) further notes that our Constitution  commits  us  collectively  to  a
       national agenda that includes the transformation of South Africa into
       a nonracial, nonsexist democratic society; and


  (3) calls on all parties to reaffirm  that  commitment  and  to  redouble
       their efforts for the speedy attainment of our national agenda.

[Applause.]

                               TRAIN DISASTER

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:

           resulting in 24 commuters losing their lives; and


       (b)  the truck accident  near  Pietersburg  resulting  in  42  family
           members losing their lives during the festive season;


  (2) expresses heartfelt condolences to the families and  friends  of  the
       deceased; and


  (3) joins them in their sorrow and shares in their loss.

Agreed to.

                           INTERNATIONAL DISASTERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move without notice:

           which more than one hundred people died and more than a thousand
           people were displaced; and


       (c)  the armoury explosion in Lagos, Nigeria, which led to the  death
           of more than a hundred people; and


  (2) expresses its heartfelt condolences to the families  and  friends  of
       the deceased, and the people of  Iran,  the  Democratic  Republic  of
       Congo and Nigeria.

Agreed to.

     PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON FINANCE TO REPORT ON MAIN APPROPRIATION BILL
                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That, upon the introduction of the Main Appropriation Bill, the Portfolio
  Committee on Finance, notwithstanding Rule 290(3), report  to  the  House
  within fifteen consecutive working days.

Agreed to.

       COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL PERFORMERS' PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, colleagues, we are  passing
amendments  to  two  Acts  here,  the  Copyright  Act  and  the  Performers'
Protection Act. These essentially, in  combination,  I  think,  extend  some
degree of  equity  and  fairness  to  the  whole  question  of  intellectual
property for performing artists in the artistic area.  The  main  thrust  of
these amendments is to provide  greater  protection  and  therefore  greater
possibilities for individual  performers  to  benefit  from  their  artistic
talent.

This is done in a number of ways.  Firstly,  it  allows  the  performers  to
bring together collecting societies which can  act  for  them.  As  one  can
imagine, an individual performer probably has far less  bargaining  capacity
and economic muscle than  those  that  they  are  dealing  with.  Therefore,
collecting societies  will  be  able  to  assist  groups  of  performers  by
ensuring  that  they  get  the  royalties  and  other  rights   from   their
performances.

We are also introducing an important new change in that traditional  dancers
will also be recognised as performers. It is the  view  of  Government  that
these two amendments constitute an important contribution to the economy  in
a number of areas. Firstly, protecting the individuals will have the  effect
of strengthening our tremendous capacity and  potential  in  the  performing
arts, and will allow this industry to grow in a more equitable  manner.  One
can also see this as a contribution to small, medium  and  micro  enterprise
development  in  that  many,  many  performing  artists   are   in   essence
individuals or small groups,  and  ensuring  that  the  revenue  from  their
performances is more equitably distributed will benefit them as well.

I believe that these two amendments are not only in  the  interests  of  our
talented artists and performers, but in the interests of the  economy  as  a
whole, as they allow for a more equitable  distribution  of  income  between
large corporations and individuals. [Applause.]

Mr N S BRUCE: Mr Chairman, these amendments are not just about  intellectual
property rights. They bring not only greater equity  to  musical  performers
on radio, but should encourage local  talent  and  creativity  in  a  market
characterised  by  overregulation  that  is  seldom  in  the  interests   of
listeners.

Radio  stations  have  for  too  long  been  reluctant  to   recognise   the
intellectual property rights of musicians, ostensibly because  of  the  cost
implications. If the market were  deregulated  and  competition  encouraged,
there could be a flowering of local talent far beyond what is  envisaged  to
flow from these humble Bills.

Having  addressed  the  unfortunate  lot  of  musicians  in  the   area   of
intellectual property rights, there ought now to be a case of examining  the
rights of other intellectual workers, in particular of journalists  who  are
caught in a political process beyond their control.

Transformation within the newspaper industry has created a large  number  of
trained journalists, some of whom can spell, with little or no  prospect  of
work  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Instead  of  their   number   enhancing
competition  and  thus  raising  journalistic  standards,  they  have   been
rejected by new media  owners  because  they  are  educated,  able  and  not
particularly politically correct.

I do not know what members think of their newspapers now. Ten  years  ago  I
thought that some of our  dailies  would  be  hard  pressed  to  deteriorate
further. It took the Irish to show me how wrong I was.

We have to  suffer  today  some  of  the  most  vacuous,  uninteresting  and
slipshod newspapers  since  Fairbairn  and  Pringle  took  on  Lord  Charles
Somerset  to  battle  for  press  freedom.  Much  of  that  is  due  to  the
swashbuckling Irish who came to plunder and stayed  to  appease.  They  have
done to journalism what  Delville  Wood  did  to  the  First  South  African
Infantry Brigade. They bought in cheaply to the Argus Company and  proceeded
to sweat assets, deskill the newsroom and raid  the  pension  fund.  In  the
process they have produced newspapers of  declining  circulation  that  have
given political correctness a new meaning and turned sycophancy into an  art
form. [Interjections.]

At Johnnic, what was once a dynamic company is now in  an  appalling  racist
stew. Some of its most profitable publications are in significant loss,  and
with Saki Macozoma ultimately to guide them, they will increasingly  go  the
way of the profits of the South African Airways, which is down and out.

There are newspapers in that group that made profits when  newsprint  prices
were proportionately higher than they are  now.  Economic  growth  was  much
lower and shareholders were even more indifferent. The reason was that  they
were well focused editorially on their markets. That focus  in  both  groups
has become diffused.

There is always an advertising reaction when sharp editorial focus is  lost,
for that focus is critical to  running  a  newspaper  profitably,  and  that
means providing advertisers with tangible markets. Newspapers  will  survive
poor distribution and indifferent management, but not  unfocused  editorial.
If the editor is confused, so will be the reader  and  the  advertiser  will
demur. A market correction will come, how soon I do  not  know.  So  perhaps
the competition authorities should examine some of  the  business  practices
of these groups as a means of smart intervention to hasten that  correction.
They could do no better than start with examining  the  intellectual  rights
of journalists or the absence of them. That could lead to an improvement  in
the quality of journalism and an enhancement of the democratic  process  far
beyond what we can imagine now. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr R H DAVIES: Chairperson, it is a pleasure  this  afternoon  to  speak  in
support of a piece of intellectual  property  legislation  that  we  can  be
confident will directly and tangibly benefit an  important  section  of  our
community. We are extremely fortunate in this country to  have  a  rich  and
diverse musical culture that has spawned a number of talented musicians  and
performers, several of  whom  are  becoming  increasingly  well  known  well
beyond the borders of our own country.
The work of many of our musicians and performers inspired our people in  the
struggle for freedom and democracy. Music performers continue to  contribute
to the development of our unique South African culture and  thereby  to  the
process of nation-building in our country.  But  we  also  know  of  pitiful
cases where many talented and even  internationally  renowned  artists  have
not received just rewards for their labours  and  have  lived  and  died  in
conditions of poverty.

We  have  also  become  aware  that  lacunae  in  and  abuse  of   copyright
legislation have contributed to that state of affairs. The Bills  before  us
today are the product of a long process of discussion and  debate  involving
musicians and performers, recording companies, broadcasters  and  collecting
societies. In public hearings which  our  committee  held  in  October  last
year, we had an opportunity to engage with many  of  the  major  players  in
this debate.

What emerged from our hearings was a consensus that  there  was  a  need  to
generate an income stream  to  benefit  our  performers  and  stimulate  the
emergence  of  creative  talent  in  our  music  industry.  There  was  also
consensus that broadcasters, as major users of the work of  our  performers,
had an obligation to contribute to that income stream.
The debate which occurred between performers and recording companies on  the
one hand, and broadcasters on the other, was  whether  this  would  best  be
achieved by way of what  is  called  a  neighbouring  intellectual  property
right which is also known  -  I  hope  this  is  not  a  reflection  on  the
technological state  of  our  broadcasting  industry  -  as  a  needle  time
royalty.

The current situation is that royalties  are  paid  only  to  composers  and
publishers of recorded music. The musicians who actually sing  and  play  on
the records are of course paid for their work,  but  they  have  no  further
remuneration when their works are broadcast by the radio stations.

After much deliberation, the  portfolio  committee  concluded  that  it  had
heard no convincing argument as to  why  the  mechanism  through  which  the
income stream for performers would be generated should not take the form  of
a neighbouring royalty right for  performers  of  recorded  music.  We  did,
however, at the committee stage, seek as  far  as  possible  to  accommodate
what the committee  considered  some  of  the  legitimate  concerns  of  the
broadcasters that were presented to us.

The Bills before us are broad general  enabling  legislation.  They  provide
for a process of  negotiating  the  level  of  and  the  mechanism  for  the
distribution of needle time royalties for performers. Many  of  the  details
of these aspects are to be regulated by way of subordinate legislation.  The
committee felt that many of  the  concerns  of  broadcasters  about  whether
community radio stations with few resources would pay at the same  rates  as
commercial stations, whether there should be a fund  for  the  promotion  of
recording artists, how disputes would be handled, and matters of  this  sort
would be dealt with in processes which would be regulated in  terms  of  the
subordinate regulations provided for in these Bills.

We were presented earlier this year, at our request, with  a  draft  of  the
regulations. In the committee we made some comments but,  more  importantly,
we received an assurance that the draft regulations would  be  published  in
due course for comment and that serious consideration would be given to  the
views expressed by various interested parties  about  those  regulations.  I
would encourage  those  who  I  know  have  continued  concerns  about  this
legislation, and who continue to contact some of  us,  to  engage  seriously
with that process.
We were  also  alerted  in  the  hearings  about  the  possibility  of  this
legislation resulting in the  payment  of  needle  time  royalties  to  many
artists from abroad and from countries  were  South  African  artists  whose
work  was  broadcast  there  would  receive  no  corresponding  needle  time
royalty.

Not all countries have a royalty for performers, including  countries  which
have some of the most  powerful  music  industries  in  the  world.  In  the
committee stage we therefore inserted  an  amendment  which  introduced  the
principle of reciprocity. This provides that  foreign  artists  whose  works
are broadcast in South Africa may receive a needle time royalty only to  the
extent  that  South  African  artists  whose  work  is  broadcast  in  those
countries receive a corresponding royalty. The amendment also  provides  for
artists from abroad in jurisdictions where there is needle time  royalty  to
enjoy in South Africa no greater rights than South African artists.

Another important aspect of this legislation is that  it  provides  for  the
regulation of collecting societies.  Collecting  societies  which  represent
artists and collect royalties on behalf of artists of course  already  exist
in South Africa and act on behalf of both local and  foreign  artists.  Such
societies are not subject to any special  regulation.  From  now  on,  these
existing societies and any others that may be formed  to  collect  royalties
accruing to artists will have to be  accredited  and  operate  according  to
regulations. We believe that this is an important step forward.

This legislation is about delivery. It is about  delivering  a  long-overdue
boost to the musical artists of this country, whom we all  revere  and  whom
we all recognise are doing much to build our South African culture. The  ANC
is therefore proud to be associated with and support this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Chairman, the amendments to  the  Copyright  Act  and  the
Performers' Protection Act are long overdue, and we in the IFP  welcome  and
support them. Local performers will now be in a  position  to  benefit  from
the royalties of their music being played on the SABC. Previously, the  SABC
had  an  unfair  advantage  over  individual  performers.  Now,  at   least,
collecting societies can assist and bargain on  behalf  of  the  performers.
Traditional performers, for example African tribal  dancers,  can  now  also
benefit in terms of  these  amendments.  Successful  nations  take  care  of
themselves, and we must also take care of ourselves.

But now on a different issue: An increase of local content quotas for  radio
and television broadcasters, which  is  also  being  suggested,  is  a  much
desired effort towards taking care of South African culture.  This  move  is
aimed at rectifying the distortions that exist  in  our  local  broadcasting
industry. Most of the entertainment content we purchase is from the  US.  It
has taken us long to act. Countries such as the UK,  Australia  and  Canada,
which acted early to implement local content quotas,  are  now  reaping  the
profits of their patriotic work. South Africa's  indigenous  creativity  and
culture would be rendered unprofitable and  unpalatable  if  we  do  not  do
anything to attach pride to local production  and  encourage  high  quality.
This in turn will reduce our dependence on foreign entertainment.

By perpetuating the status quo, South Africa  cannot  reasonably  expect  to
grow its arts and communication industries. The growth of  these  industries
is doomed unless some balance is struck in  the  short  term.  We  wish  our
performers well and hope that they  will  benefit  financially  from  needle
time  royalties  in  this  regard.  The  IFP  supports   this   legislation.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the following  member  is
going to make his maiden speech. [Applause.]

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: Mr Chairperson, although I only participated in the  dying
moments of the  deliberations  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Trade  and
Industry on these two interrelated pieces of legislation, I however made  it
my business to gain a clearer insight into  the  issues  which  led  to  the
clamour for these amendments. It is quite clear that  there  has  been  wide
and exhaustive participation on these  two  Bills.  The  New  NP  has  great
pleasure in supporting these amendments to both the Copyright  Act  and  the
Performers' Protection Act.

It is a basic principle of fairness in any modern economic system  that  any
person should be reasonably remunerated for his or her  labour.  The  labour
of the mind is just as important as the labour of  the  physical  body.  So,
people who create intellectual property should be fairly paid  for  the  use
of the intellectual property they create, particularly if other  people  use
that intellectual property for their own commercial gain.

In South Africa, since 1965, businesses which seek  to  make  a  profit  for
themselves by playing or broadcasting music recordings  made  by  performers
and record companies have not had to pay a single cent for the use of  those
recordings. This applies to radio stations which have paid nothing  for  the
use of recordings by our great artists like  Mahlathini,  Margaret  Singana,
Basil Coetzee and thousands of other artists who have lived out  their  last
days and gone to their  graves  as  poor  people,  even  as  radio  stations
continue to play the recordings that these great artists made at the  height
of their popularity.

These radio stations have become more and more valuable, and  their  owners,
including the state through its ownership of the SABC,  have  become  richer
and richer off the work of the great artists whose records they have  played
in order to attract listeners and advertisers who want to  reach  all  those
listeners. This continues to apply to the great  South  African  artists  of
today, whose music one can hear on our radio stations  but  who  receive  no
payment from those stations - artists like  Sibongile  Khumalo,  the  Soweto
String Quartet, Lucky Dube, Mandoza, Rebecca, Vusi  Mahlasela  and  so  many
others.  These  amendments  to  the  Copyright  Act  and   the   Performers'
Protection Act are  intended  to  correct  this  unfair  economic  imbalance
between  our  musicians  and  the  businesses  which  use   our   musicians'
recordings in order to make their own profits.

I understand that an assurance has been given  by  the  artists  and  record
companies that invest in making recordings by South African  musicians  that
they will not ask for any so-called needle time  royalties  to  be  paid  by
community radio stations. They only ask for fair royalties  to  be  paid  by
successful commercial radio stations and  by  other  commercial  enterprises
that use their records to attract customers, such as discos and clubs.

All over the rest of the world, with the exception of the USA,  artists  get
paid by radio stations and by other commercial users  of  their  recordings.
Our artists are only asking to be treated in the same way as artists in  the
rest of the world. Our artists and recording companies  actually  had  these
rights in our country until 1965 when  the  government  of  that  time  took
these rights away. Ironically, this occurred just as most  of  the  rest  of
the world was actually extending these rights to protect artists and  record
companies against the impact of tape recording and cassette piracy.

In conclusion, in the past 37 years too  many  South  African  artists  have
died in poverty as a direct result of being  deprived  of  income  from  the
playing of their recordings as they grew older. These Bills  will  ensure  a
better future for our musicians in the years ahead. [Time expired.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Mr Chairperson, the ACDP agrees that it is true that  the  arts
have been sadly abused, in that people who create music or visual  art  find
it extremely difficult to capitalise on it.

The Bills before us are an  attempt  to  rectify  that  situation  in  South
Africa, bringing us in  line  with  other  countries  by  creating  suitable
mechanisms whereby problems of collection of dues and  negotiation  of  fees
can be addressed.

These Bills should be a major stimulus  to  South  African  performing  arts
because rewards will be an incentive. South Africa is  rich  in  beauty  and
artistic potential due to  our  demographic  and  cultural  diversity.  This
could be a tremendous capital earner in our country and should be  developed
and protected. At the same time, our market must give  the  same  protection
to artists practising in South Africa as they would get elsewhere  in  order
to entice performers from abroad to practise their arts here.

While the Copyright Amendment  Bill  focuses  on  collection  of  fees,  the
Performers' Protection Amendment Bill focuses  on  improving  the  currently
weak  bargaining  position  of  performers.  This  is  done  by  introducing
collective  bargaining   in   order   to   equalise   the   disproportionate
relationship between performers and large TV  and  radio  networks,  thereby
levelling the playing field between consumers and producers.

The ACDP will vote in favour of these Bills  as  they  are  enabling  Bills,
whereby the state enables the private sector  to  create  the  apparatus  to
self-regulate in order to receive just rewards for artistic endeavour.

Dr J  BENJAMIN:  Mr  Chairperson,  hon  members,  I  thank  this  House  for
providing this opportunity to  announce  to  musicians  that  the  Copyright
Amendment Bill and the Performers' Protection Amendment Bill, to  be  passed
today, will provide a means to a better life for  performers  whose  records
are played on the air. Whereas the  existing  Acts  only  provided  for  the
payment of royalties to composers and authors,  these  amending  Bills  will
ensure that performers are paid  royalties  every  time  their  records  are
played.

The amendments to the Copyright Act, 1978, and  the  Performers'  Protection
Act, 1967, must be viewed in the context of ongoing  attempts  to  transform
the South African music industry, to improve the quality of  life  of  South
African musicians and to make the industry more competitive.

Even though the content of local music has been increased in the  programmes
of broadcasters through the introduction of  quotas,  these  Acts  have  not
allowed for local performers to be paid royalties which  have  been  limited
to composers and lyricists.

The amendments also allow  for  the  regulation  of  the  establishment  and
operation of  collecting  societies  that  are  publicly  accountable,  have
collective bargaining powers and make provision  for  a  dispute  resolution
mechanism if there is a lack of agreement  between  broadcasters,  recording
companies and performers with  regard  to  payment  of  royalties.  Further,
copyright is extended to performances of indigenous music and folklore.

While these amendments do not address all the ills  in  the  industry,  they
indicate  a  movement  in  the  deadlock  which  existed.  For   six   years
stakeholders have been  unable  to  agree  on  the  form  and  content  that
neighbouring rights should take within this developing industry.

While the rest of the  world  began  to  extend  copyright  and  payment  of
royalty to performers,  in  terms  of  the  Rome  Convention  of  1961,  the
apartheid government removed neighbouring rights from the Copyright  Act  of
1965.

Significant media attention has recently been generated in relation  to  the
impoverished circumstances under which great South African artists live  out
their lives.

The late Basil Manenberg Coetzee  was  a  well-known  saxophone  player  and
composer who, together with his band, Sabenza, recorded a number of  albums,
and also recorded with other   world-renowned  musicians  such  as  Abdullah
Ibrahim. He and other black musicians eagerly performed free  of  charge  at
many  freedom  rallies  during  the  1980s,  attributing  their  poverty  to
apartheid and believing that black musicians would have a better life  in  a
free South Africa.

When Basil died, he left behind his family, in Mitchells Plain, hardly  able
to pay their rent. Concern was  expressed  at  the  highest  levels  of  our
Government about this issue after the death of Simon Mahlathini Nkabinde.

According to one obituary, Simon Mahlathini Nkabinde, who died  at  the  age
of 61, has been ignored by the local radio and the print media for  so  long
that it is hard to believe that there was a time when he and  the  Mahotella
Queens were the hottest property in black music in South Africa.

In  the  60s  Mahlathini  and  his  band  played  to  crowded  stadiums   in
Johannesburg and in Swaziland.  They  played  a  big  role  in  popularising
uMbaqanga music, which fell in popularity in the late 70s, as  part  of  the
revolt against apartheid. He was signed up  with  Gallo  Records,  which  he
left in 1964 to join EMI Records.

He  went  back  to  Gallo  Records  in  the  80s,  at  which  time  he   got
international exposure. He provided  Harry  Belafonte  with  backing  tracks
which were recorded and shipped back to the United States. He and  his  band
were also flown out to  France  where  they  set  audiences  alight  on  the
university circuit and in big  clubs  in  Britain,  Europe  and  the  United
States.

In 1988, they played at the Nelson Mandela Birthday Concert at  Wembley,  in
England. Later they  played  in  New  York  Central  Park  before  a  jiving
audience of close to 500 000. Unfortunately, this international love  affair
with their music on stage did not translate into record  or  CD  sales,  and
they were all but completely ignored at  home.  Radio  stations  refused  to
play Mahlathini and the print media paid him scant attention.

Such musicians have made  their  contribution  to  the  development  of  the
national culture in spite of facing many barriers  in  the  music  industry,
which has been dominated by Western culture,  inaccessible  to  local  music
and content. Other talented musicians have had  to  leave  this  country  in
order to gain access to the market. One living base player,  Spencer  Mbadu,
out of frustration, a few years after liberation, took his  instruments  out
of his shack and made a bonfire with them.

The amendments to the Copyright Act and the Performers' Protection Act  were
inspired by the need to address what has  become  known  as  the  Mahlathini
syndrome - well-known musicians living in  abject  poverty,  some  dying  as
paupers, because this country has been slow  in  nurturing  those  who  have
been instrumental in shaping our distinctive South African music culture.

The extension of copyright to a broadcast right  and  a  public  performance
right is known as neighbouring rights. Since 1995,  stakeholders  have  been
debating  whether  royalties  which  accrue  from  the  recorded  rights  of
performing artists, which is known as needle time, should  be  paid  to  the
performers.

The Performers' Protection Act of  1967  confers  rights  on  performers  of
literary and musical works, that is, the composers,  but  fails  to  specify
who is entitled to  royalties  of  work  that  is  subject  to  intellectual
property protection.

At the international level,  South  Africa  has  not  acceded  to  the  Rome
Convention of 1961, which was  specifically  designed  to  deal  with  these
rights, and administered by three agencies, namely the International  Labour
Organisation, the World Intellectual Property Organisation  and  the  United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. To the  contrary,
these rights were removed from our Copyright Act of 1965, by  the  apartheid
government.

The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, known as  WPPT,  of  1996,  for
the first time recognises performers  as  legitimate  rights  holders  along
with other creators, giving  performers  independent  and  exclusive  rights
regarding  their  performances.  It  provides  for  record   companies   and
performers to  enjoy  a  right  of  remuneration  for  the  use  of  records
published for commercial purposes, though this provision is not mandatory.

As South Africa re-enters the global economy, the importance  to  accede  to
international treaties, conventions and  trade  agreements  is  increasingly
recognised as an important mechanism for South Africa successfully to  trade
with countries  with  different  intellectual  property  law  regimes  in  a
harmonised legal environment.

The WPPT treaty has not been universally  implemented.  The  United  States,
India and China have not acceded. The European approach  has  been  to  view
the performer as a collaborator of the  author  of  the  musical  work  and,
therefore, entitled  to  share  in  the  copyright  royalties,  whereas  the
American approach views the performer as an adaptor  of  the  original  work
and, therefore,  not  entitled  to  copyright  royalties.  Therefore,  South
Africa is in a position to choose a legal course most  beneficial  to  local
conditions.

Stakeholders who have participated in this debate claim to be acutely  aware
of, and sympathise with, the plight of South  African  performers.  However,
the debate has centred around who should bear the cost,  how  the  royalties
should be collected, and whether needle time  should  appropriately  address
the plight of the performer. Broadcasters have argued that  the  development
fund would more  adequately  address  the  social  and  financial  needs  of
performers, while recording companies have been in favour of royalties  paid
by the  broadcaster  and  shared  between  the  recording  company  and  the
performer.

Broadcasters make their revenue through advertising. While they already  pay
a range of levies, royalties, in respect  of  performers  and  producers  of
sound recordings, have been excluded. In  this  respect,  stakeholders  have
accepted the policy  objectives  of  needle  time  and  the  principle  that
broadcasters should  compensate  performers  for  the  use  of  their  sound
recordings.

In  addition,  the  existing  Acts  empowered  collecting  societies  to  be
licensing authorities in the past. This enabled them to charge  a  licensing
fee to all venues that played recorded music in public. Such societies  have
been able to collect millions of rands from entrepreneurs who  played  music
on their premises, and they were accountable  only  to  their  members.  The
amending  Bills  provide  that  collecting  societies  shall   be   publicly
accountable and statutory, rather than nonstatutory bodies.

In addition, the amending Bills seek to bring performers of  expressions  of
folklore under the protection of  the  Act.  The  expression  of  indigenous
knowledge has, up to now, been excluded from copyright protection.

These amending Bills are steps in the right  direction.  They  will  improve
the quality of life and the  working  conditions  of  local  musicians,  and
bring our fledgling music industry in line with international standards.  It
can only bode well for the further development  and  transformation  of  the
South African music industry and its entry into the  global  economy.  I  am
positive that the implementation of  these  amending  Bills  will  stimulate
further  investment  in  the  industry  and  positively  contribute  to  the
development of our distinctive national culture.

In conclusion, I call on the industry and all stakeholders to  devote  time,
effort and budget to engage in  mass  education  programmes  in  partnership
with Government. Without musicians knowing their  rights,  and  without  the
resources to organise collecting societies,  the  legislation  being  passed
today will remain unknown on the  Statute  Book,  and  our  fledgling  music
industry will remain uncompetitive and undeveloped. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Mr Chairperson, the amendment of the Copyright Act of  1978
is what the doctor has ordered for our artists and performers.  People  have
long been exploited by unscrupulous producers and promoters.

A good number of our artists of world acclaim died as poor as  church  mice.
They performed and sang to large audiences, but their fame and  worth  ended
on the stage. The insertion of the clause on royalties in section 9  of  the
principal Act is the best news ever for our artists. The clause  spells  out
clearly that no person may broadcast, cause the transmission of  or  play  a
sound recording without payment of a royalty to the owner  of  the  relevant
copyright.

The above clause also sets out clearly what  procedures  to  follow  in  the
event of there being no agreement. The procedure of sharing the proceeds  of
the royalty between the owner of  the  copyright  and  any  performer  whose
performance is featured on  the  sound  recording,  is  clearly  stipulated.
There is then no reason why our artists have to die  as  paupers  with  such
legislation in place.

The  Performers'  Protection  Amendment  Bill  also  seeks  to  ensure  that
performers  are  entitled  to  royalties  for  work  that  is   subject   to
intellectual property protection. The Bill emphasises the need  for  payment
of royalties in respect of any record being played by a broadcaster. We  are
grateful to the stakeholders within the music industry  for  having  reached
consensus on how the issues of royalties should be addressed. This is  proof
that where there is a will, there is  a  way.  The  UCDP  supports  the  two
Bills.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairman, the PAC supports the Copyright Amendment  Bill.
The Bill is amending the Copyright Act of 1978, which  can  be  seen  to  be
fairly old. It was created more than 20 years ago,  and  much  has  happened
since then.

The major purpose of this Bill is to define an expression  and  to  amend  a
definition, to make further provision regarding the nature of  copyright  in
sound recordings  and  to  provide  for  matters  connected  therewith.  For
instance, section 1  of  the  Copyright  Act  of  1978  is  amended  by  the
insertion of a  definition  that  defines  a  ``collecting  society''  as  a
collecting society established under  the  Act,  and  this  takes  place  in
subsection (1), after the definition of ``cinematograph  film''.  Section  9
of the principal Act is further substituted by a new section,  as  described
in clause 2. The nature of copyright in  sound  recordings  will  in  future
include matters such as the broadcasting of a sound recording;  causing  the
sound recording to be transmitted in a diffusion service; and  communicating
the sound recording to the public.

The Bill also deals with royalties and states that  in  the  absence  of  an
agreement to the contrary, no person may broadcast, cause  the  transmission
of or play a sound recording, as contemplated in the new section  9  of  the
Copyright Act of 1978. The Bill is in  step  with  the  rapid  technological
development in communication, and therefore the PAC supports it.

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mnr die Voorsitter, die FA steun heelhartig hierdie  wet,
maar daar is 'n ding of twee wat ek graag van die agb Minister wou verneem.

Hierdie  wet  gaan  Suid-Afrikaners  op  gelyke  voet  plaas   met   oorsese
kunstenaars. Ons is baie dankbaar daarvoor,  maar  omdat  dit  intellektuele
eiendom  gaan  beskerm,  laat  dit  'n  mens   wonder   hoe   dit   'n   ANC
mimiekkunstenaar, met 'n Nuwe NP-pop op sy skoot, gaan affekteer,  want  die
kunstenaar is die buikspreker en hy moet betaal word vir sy werk en nié  die
pop nie. Die pop gaan net die napraatwerk doen, alhoewel die pop die  prater
sal wees en die ANC-kunstenaar die kop na willekeur sal draai  en  die  mond
sal manipuleer om te sê wat hy moet sê.

Ons steun graag die wet, want ons wil sien wie is die intellektueel, is  dit
die pop of  die  buikspreker!  [Gelag.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr  J  P  I  BLANCHÉ:  Mr  Chairman,  the  FA  supports  this   legislation
wholeheartedly, but there are one or two things I should  like  to  ask  the
hon the Minister.

This legislation  will  place  South  Africans  on  an  equal  footing  with
overseas artists. For this we are very grateful,  but  because  it  will  be
protecting intellectual property it makes one wonder  how  it  is  going  to
affect an ANC mime artist with a New NP doll on its lap, because the  artist
is the ventriloquist and he must be paid for his work,  and  not  the  doll.
The doll will only be doing the mimicking, although the  doll  will  be  the
speaker and the ANC artist will turn the head at  will  and  manipulate  the
mouth to say what he has to say.

We have pleasure in supporting the legislation, because  we  would  like  to
see who the intellectual is, the doll or the ventriloquist! [Laughter.]]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, dit lyk vir my daar is een verskil  tussen
'n politikus en 'n kunstenaar: 'n politikus sal  betaal  om  oor  die  radio
gehoor te word, terwyl 'n kunstenaar betaal word om oor die radio  uitgesaai
te word!

Wanneer 'n ingenieur 'n apparaat of 'n  masjien  ontwerp,  word  hy  beskerm
deur baie streng patentregte, en in die verkoop van die  patent  lê  in  die
reël ook sy grootste wins. Skending van  patentregte  is  'n  baie  ernstige
oortreding wat ook ernstig gestraf  word.  'n  Kunstenaar  is  eweneens  die
patenthouer op  sy  kunswerk,  en  tóg  is  dit  daagliks  die  praktyk  dat
produksies  gedupliseer  en  kommersieel  uitgesaai  word,  sonder  dat  die
kunstenaar krediet daarvoor ontvang. Dit is  absoluut  noodsaaklik  dat  ons
kunstenaars se regte beskerm moét word. Die skepper of  die  uitvoerder  van
'n musiekstuk is primêr die eienaar daarvan, en  daarom  verwelkom  die  AEB
hierdie wetgewing.

Die daarstelling van 'n statutêre liggaam om aan bogenoemde aandag  te  gee,
word verwelkom. Dit moet net  in  gedagte  gehou  word  dat,  hoewel  so  'n
liggaam statutêr bemagtig word, dit primêr 'n instelling van die  burgerlike
samelewing bly en nie 'n stuk staatsmasjinerie  word  nie.  So  omskryf  die
memorandum van die wet hul funksie tereg, naamlik om kollektief  namens  die
kunstenaars te beding met uitsaaiers met betrekking tot tantièmes.

Die AEB wil twee waarskuwings rig. Ons doen 'n beroep op kunstenaars om  nie
hierdie regte té ver te  probeer  druk  nie.  Dit  moenie  vir  die  publiek
onbekostigbaar word om dit wat in  'n  sekere  sin  volksbesit  geword  het,
gereeld te kan hoor nie. Gereelde uitsending van 'n kunstenaar se  werk  oor
radiostasies is ook van die beste reklame wat weer  neerslag  vind  in  hoër
plate verkope of groter bywoningsyfers by konserte en optredes.

Tweedens,  die  ooreenkoms  tussen  die  kunstenaar   en   byvoorbeeld   die
platemaatskappy is  'n  privaataangeleentheid  waaroor  die  wet  tereg  nie
staatsinmenging voorskryf nie. Tóg gebeur dit dikwels  dat  kunstenaars  hul
kopiereg aan platemaatskappye verkoop ten einde hul produk op  die  mark  te
kry en die resultaat is vet katte by  die  platemaatskappye  en  kunstenaars
wat arm na hul graf gaan. Die benoemde statutêre liggame moet ten eerste  na
die belang van die kunstenaar omsien.

Die  AEB  steun  hierdie  wetsontwerpe.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairman, it seems to me there is one difference between  a
politician and an artist: a politician will pay to be heard  on  the  radio,
while an artist is paid to be broadcast on the radio!

When an engineer designs an apparatus or  a  machine,  he  is  protected  by
strict patent rights and generally his greatest  profit  also  lies  in  the
sale of the patent. Violation of patent rights is  a  very  serious  offence
which is also severely punished. In the same way an  artist  is  the  patent
holder of his art, and yet the practice occurs daily  that  productions  are
duplicated and broadcast commercially without the artist  receiving  credit.
It is absolutely essential that our artists' rights must be  protected.  The
creator or the performer of a musical piece is primarily the owner  of  that
piece, and for that reason the AEB welcomes this legislation.
The creation of a statutory body to pay attention to the  aforementioned  is
welcomed. It must just be  borne  in  mind  that  although  a  body  may  be
empowered statutorily, it remains primarily an institution of civil  society
and does not become a piece of state machinery. The memorandum  to  the  Act
therefore  defines   their   function   correctly,   namely   to   negotiate
collectively on behalf of the  artists  with  broadcasters  with  regard  to
royalties.

The AEB would like to address two warnings. We appeal to artists not to  try
to push these rights too far. It must  not  become  too  expensive  for  the
public regularly to be able to hear  that  which  in  a  certain  sense  has
become public property. Regular broadcasting of an artist's  work  on  radio
stations is also one of the best forms of advertising, which  is  manifested
in higher record  sales  or  greater  attendance  figures  at  concerts  and
performances.

Secondly, the agreement between the  artist  and  the  record  company,  for
example, is a private matter with regard to which  the  Act  correctly  does
not  prescribe  state  intervention.  However,  it  sometimes  happens  that
artists sell their copyright to record  companies  in  order  to  get  their
product on the market and the result is fat cats  at  the  record  companies
and artists who die poor. The aforementioned statutory bodies  must  see  to
the interests of the artist first.

The AEB supports these Bills.]

Mrs B N SONO: Mr Chairperson, hon members, consultations  with  stakeholders
within the music industry  have  taken  place,  and  consensus  was  reached
amongst  stakeholders  that  the  issue  of  royalties  or  needle  time  be
addressed  by  amendments  to  both  the  Copyright  Act  of  1978  and  the
Performers' Protection Act.

The Bill seeks to amend the Acts in order to give  effect  to  proposals  by
stakeholders. The  DP  supports  the  Bill.  Any  measure  on  the  part  of
Government, especially  legislative,  to  enhance  the  development  of  our
society, will always be applauded. However, the DP has a  concern  with  the
proposed amendment to  section  39  of  the  principal  Act,  which  is  the
provision  enabling  the  Minister  to  provide   for   the   establishment,
composition, funding and functions  of  societies  contemplated  in  section
9(a).

The DP supports the view of stakeholders  that  a  new  collecting  society,
specifically for the collection  and  distribution  of  royalties  emanating
from needle time, should be created and controlled  by  the  rights  holders
and performers, and that such formation should  be  done  on  the  basis  of
regulations by the Minister, for the following  reasons.  Small  and  medium
recording  companies  which  are  purely  South  African   outnumber   large
recording companies. A greater percentage of performers  and  musicians  are
from the formerly  disadvantaged  sector,  and  therefore  special  emphasis
should be placed on their training and upgrading, so that they can  rise  to
higher levels in business and skills.

In their documents on affirmative action and the new Constitution,  the  ANC
has made various assurances about the nature of that policy. I quote:


  We have to free the capacities of millions of people who have never had a
  real chance to show their mettle.

I would like to pose a question to this Government: Is it  not  time  to  go
back to the Freedom Charter, instead of empowering and  centralising  powers
in the Cabinet? [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mrs B M NTULI: Chairperson, the Portfolio Committee on  Trade  and  Industry
welcomes the introduction of the needle time Bills, which are the  Copyright
Amendment Bill and  the  Performers'  Protection  Amendment  Bill,  in  this
House.

All over the world, music is an essential component of life,  and  plays  an
important role in the development and transformation of  human  society.  In
our country,  music  contributed  significantly  to  the  struggle  for  our
liberation. We are proud to say that the South African  music  industry  has
great musical talent, and the development  of  the  South  African  cultural
endowments into internationally marketable products is  the  challenge  that
faces the South African music industry. The music industry is  very  complex
and consists of different role-players who  produce  a  variety  of  musical
products,  and  includes  creators,  agents,  record  companies  and  retail
outlets.

The South African music industry is  a  key  provider  of  jobs  and  income
revenue in the economy, with a gross turnover of approximately  R1  billion.
However, we must bear in mind that five of the six  multinational  companies
that control the global music industry, namely BMG, EMI, Polygram, Sony  and
Gallo, have South African subsidiaries. Exposure to both  the  domestic  and
international markets  aims  at  improving  the  quality  of  South  African
musicians.

We recognise that music  is  a  rapidly  increasing  and  highly  profitable
industry with limitless potential. The music industry is  a  powerful  means
of   enhancing   the   country's   identity   and   distinctiveness,   while
simultaneously creating employment, developing human skills  and  generating
social cohesion and capital.

However, while international music is thriving in the South African  market,
the development of local music is not keeping pace and we  need  to  correct
that situation. Hence the Department of Trade and Industry had  to  step  in
to help regulate the industry, because many of our artists live in poverty.

DTI is responsible for the copyright legislation that governs  the  cultural
industry and for  the  creation  of  good  conditions,  including  incentive
packages  and  export  support,  that  facilitate  the   growth   of   those
industries. This regulation of  the  industry  revolves  around  the  rights
concerning, and payment for, exploiting musical work that  is  protected  in
copyright legislation.

In South Africa needle time legislation is  based  on  the  World  Copyright
Treaty. The absence of  needle  time  legislation,  that  is  the  broadcast
right, was one of the key obstacles to the development of  local  music  and
the music industry.  Needle  time  gives  musicians  in  their  capacity  as
performers the right to receive remuneration when their records  are  either
played on radio or performed live, amounting to a public performance  right.
This right to needle time impacts on the income of and expenditure for  both
musicians and broadcasters.

Ngizobe ngiyahluleka uma ngingavumela laba abathi umculo  eNingizimu  Afrika
awukulungele ukudlalwa kuzo zonke iziteshi zomsakazo.

Sinomculo  owehlukene  eNingizimu  Afrika.  Ngingabala   ngithini?   Kukhona
umbhaqanga, umculo wezenkolo,  i-kwaito,  umculo  opholile  lapho  sikhuluma
khona ngabantu abafana noRingo,  oJoe  Nina,  noSibongile  Khumalo.  Kukhona
umculo womdabu lapho sikhuluma  khona  ngoMfazomnyama  othi  uma  esezibonga
athi,  ``umfana  ozalwa  yinyanga  naye  oyinyanga  kanti  unina  yisangoma,
umfowabo ngumthakathi.'' Singabala sithini? [Ihlombe.] (Translation of  Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[I would be failing myself if I agreed with those who said  music  in  South
Africa was not ready to be played over all radio stations.

We have different types of music in South Africa, the list  is  endless.  We
have umbhaqanga, which is a mixture of Western and African  music  religious
music, kwaito, and cool music, which is played by  people  like  Ringo,  Joe
Nina and Sibongile Khumalo.  We  also  have  traditional  music,  played  by
people like Mfazomnyama, who praises himself by saying: ``He is  a  boy  who
was begotten by an inyanga, his mother is an isangoma and his brother  is  a
witch''. The list is endless. [Applause.]]

Through  intellectual  property  rights  the  owners  of  these  rights  are
entitled to sell the same recording time and again over  a  50-year  or  75-
year period. This implies that musicians and composers  form  the  basis  of
the industry.

South Africa enjoys a regulated and  enabling  environment  which  lays  the
foundation for the  development  and  growth  of  the  South  African  music
industry. The functioning of collection societies strengthens this  enabling
environment,  which,  through  the  current  needle  time  legislation,   is
accountable, credible, transparent and efficient.

Ake ngigcine ngalokhu.  Sinomculo  owehlukene.  Kukhona  nomculo  wamaBhunu.
Bacula kamnandi yini pho Uma sebethi, ``Daar is  niks  soos  ware  liefde''.
[Uhleko.] [Let me conclude by saying that we have different types of  music.
There is also Boer music. They are playing very well when they  say:  ``Daar
is niks soos ware liefde [There is nothing like true love.]''.  [Laughter.]]


However, the South African music industry's future ultimately  lies  in  the
promotion of local talent. The current local content quota is 20%.  The  IBA
has the constitutional right to enforce and monitor local content  in  order
to  protect  musicians  within  the  legal  ambit  of  a  range  of  rights,
protections and benefits.

The promotion of music is not limited to the music  industry,  but  also  by
the effective utilisation of the South African culture. We need to  overcome
the barriers of the cultural  separation  of  apartheid.  We  also  need  to
ensure that  musicians  are  paid  accordingly.  We  must  fight  piracy  in
whatever form possible, because  it  is  costing  the  South  African  music
industry millions in lost revenue. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Minister,  just  before  you  speak,
members might have realised that we did  not  have  interpretation  for  the
isiZulu part of the member's speech. This is because the Whips did not  make
arrangements to inform the Table about that. Can I just draw your  attention
to the fact that Whips need to arrange with  the  Table  for  interpretation
before  members  take  to  the  podium,  so  that  the  Table  can   arrange
interpretation for their speeches.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, it  was  a  pity  that  you
stopped such a fine performance. I think that if needle  time  were  already
in existence, the hon member would be wealthy. I would not be  able  to  say
quite the same about the hon member Bruce, because I think  that  if  needle
time  were  available  now,  there  would  not  be  many  buyers   for   his
performance. [Laughter.] But he  made  some  interesting  points  about  the
media.
I think it is gratifying to see that all parties have  supported  this  Bill
with enthusiasm. I am very  pleased  about  that,  because  as  a  piece  of
legislation it might seem to be relatively small, but there is  considerable
enabling capacity in these amendments. It  can  do  a  great  deal  for  our
performers and artists and liberate their talents.

I would also support the hon member Davies that it would  be  important  for
people to engage with the regulations when  we  publish  them.  It  is  very
important that these provisions are administered properly.

This process has been the result of some very important consultation by  the
stakeholders. I think we need to  congratulate  them.  It  is  not  an  easy
issue. They have come to terms with it, and the result is good  legislation.
I would agree with the hon member Bekker that the  local  content  programme
is important,  and  these  amendments  can  complement  it  considerably  in
supporting our industry.

The presentation made by the hon member Benjamin was an excellent  and  very
informative one. What will be important, as he has  indicated  and  we  will
certainly undertake this, is the educative process. I think  it  is  crucial
that artists and performers do know what their rights  are,  and  that  they
can benefit from that.

It is going to be important for us,  too,  to  ensure  that  the  collecting
societies, which are now more regulated,  are  properly  administered.  They
will fall under the jurisdiction of Cipro. It will be  very  important  that
we ensure that the benefits do accrue to the artists, and  we  will  attempt
to do that.

I  believe  these  Acts  do  offer  the  prospect  of  liberating  our  very
considerable  talents.  I  think  they  further  improve  the   intellectual
property dispensation in South Africa by making it more equitable  and  more
beneficial to those that own that intellectual property.

Finally, I would like to thank, very sincerely indeed, the stakeholders  for
the hard work  done  in  the  lengthy  consultation  process  and  also  the
committee for listening to that and making important proposals for  changes.
The reciprocity provision is  a  very  interesting  one  and,  I  think,  an
important one in setting standards for international agreements. This  is  a
direction that is very useful for us to follow, and certainly it will  be  a
direction that Government intends supporting and defending. I would like  to
thank members for the support. [Applause.]

                  UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Chairperson, hon  members,  comrades  and  colleagues,  hon
members will recall that in November last year this  Parliament  passed  the
Unemployment Insurance Bill, which  was  subsequently  assented  to  by  the
President of the Republic on 13 January 2002  and  later  published  in  the
Gazette on 28 January 2002. We look forward to the promulgation of this  law
from 1 April this year.

The Bill before us today is, essentially, a money Bill in terms  of  section
77 of the Constitution. The Unemployment Insurance Contributions Bill  seeks
to improve the revenue collection regime of the Unemployment Insurance  Fund
and to strengthen its fraud detection system.

Employers registered with the SA Revenue Service for the purpose of  PAYE  -
pay as you earn - or  the  Skills  Development  Levy  are  expected  to  pay
contributions  through  the  already  established  tax  collection   system.
Employers that are not registered must  pay  directly  to  the  Unemployment
Insurance Commissioner.

I think that it is appropriate to deal with this  piece  of  legislation  in
this month of February, during which the attention of the nation is  focused
on safety and security matters. In  this  Bill  we  give  a  stern  warning,
particularly to both employers and employees, that  gone  are  the  days  of
defrauding this Government through the UIF with impunity.

The legacy of high levels of employer  default  and  noncompliance  will  be
addressed by tougher penalties and fines on  those  employers  who  fail  to
comply. The  Department  of  Labour  is  also  tasked  with  the  additional
responsibilities of dealing with issues such as underdisclosure of  employee
earnings, the practice of work and  draw,  particularly  by  employees,  and
deliberate misrepresentation of employee earnings by employers.

We, however, also wish to take this opportunity  to  thank  those  employers
who have consistently complied with the current laws,  and  trust  that  the
new system will make their task much easier.

This piece of legislation is about poverty relief and the protection of  the
most vulnerable sections of our society in the labour  market.  Workers  who
become unemployed or their dependants are enabled  to  claim  benefits  from
this fund, including maternity, illness and adoption benefits.

There are, however, three outstanding matters that the Department of  Labour
is expected to  finalise  within  a  specified  period.  The  first  is  the
extension of coverage  of  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Act  -  essentially
social security  legislation  extended  to  domestic  workers  and  seasonal
workers within 12 months of this  promulgation.  The  second  matter  is  to
investigate whether the application of this law discriminates against  women
in terms of maternity benefits. And, the  third  outstanding  matter  is  to
report on the inclusion of public servants.
This Bill represents a comprehensive strategy that seeks to  strengthen  the
Unemployment Insurance Fund to deal  with  systemic  inefficiencies  of  the
past. Hon members will recall  that  the  previous  government,  before  the
democratic one, after 1979 placed this fund on the  road  to  bankruptcy  by
increasing the coverage and reducing the contributions. Today  we  are  once
more proud and pleased to report that this fund is back on  track  and  will
henceforth be able to meet its obligations.

The ANC supports this Bill and wishes to thank the portfolio  committee  for
their co-operation in this matter. [Applause.]

Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES: Chairperson, the Democratic Alliance has no  problem
with the substantive legislation before this House today, which  effectively
will be responsible for  the  administration  and  collection  of  the  bulk
contributions arising from the Unemployment Insurance Act. Also, we  believe
passionately that an efficient and effective unemployment insurance fund  is
beneficial in a developing economy like ours.

The notion that contributors are entitled to bridging finances to  ease  the
financial burden between jobs makes economic sense. Also, the  provision  of
maternity benefits, for a fixed period associated with childbirth, is  vital
if we are to recognise the importance of women's role in society.

Now, while the Unemployment  Insurance  Act  made  great  strides  in  these
directions,  the  Democratic  Alliance  voted   against   the   Unemployment
Insurance Fund Bill because, in our view, it fell short of providing a  new,
streamlined, financially viable and efficient unemployment insurance fund.

The inclusion of employees who work  more  than  24  hours  a  month  for  a
particular employer, the exclusion of civil  servants  and  the  lack  of  a
simple and competent mechanism to  administer  the  important  inclusion  of
domestic and seasonal workers into the ambit of the fund, rendered the  Bill
unworkable in our opinion.

Now, today at  the  meeting  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Labour,  the
department and the director-general outlined the  work  programme  for  this
year. The director-general paid particular attention  to  the  follow-up  on
the issues from the  Unemployment  Insurance  Act,  including  a  task  team
investigating the exclusion of benefits to  domestic  and  seasonal  workers
and a report on the inclusion of public  servants  into  the  ambit  of  the
fund.

If this piece of legislation today,  and  the  package  that  makes  up  the
entirety of unemployment insurance in general, is to be of any real  use  to
the people of South Africa, then the department  must  strive  to  introduce
measures that facilitate the easy and  relatively  effortless  inclusion  of
domestic and seasonal workers into the ambit of the  fund.  That  is  vital.
The decision, also, to exclude civil servants from the fund must  surely  be
one of the biggest and most significant problems associated with the Act.

The very real potential of infringement of  civil  servants'  constitutional
rights aside, the other consequence of the exclusion  also  means  that  the
fund loses a massive  ongoing  financial  contribution  from  the  country's
largest employer, rendering the  fund  less  financially  stable.  The  only
logical conclusion is for the department and the Minister to facilitate  the
inclusion of civil servants into the ambit of the fund.
The Democratic Alliance supports this administrative Bill before  the  House
today, and hopes that the department will do all in its power  to  make  the
fund a truly effective vehicle for those who really need it - the people  of
our country.

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Mr Chairman, hon Ministers, and hon members, South  Africa
is entering into a glowing new era in so far  as  this  Bill  is  concerned.
This Bill comes in a period engulfed by very harsh  economic  realities,  as
the majority of our people are unemployed  and  more  and  more  are  losing
jobs. The effects of such a predicament have  severe  consequences  for  the
state and result in crime, violent acts, especially on pensioners,  harassed
by their children and grandchildren daily.

South African labour laws  had  previously  denied  the  majority  of  South
African workers the right  to  advance  their  interests.  The  Unemployment
Insurance Fund is but one of the benefits  which  the  majority  of  workers
were excluded from, particularly the domestic workers, the  farmworkers  and
the seasonal workers, as well as public servants.

The IFP welcomes the inclusion of domestic and  seasonal  workers  into  the
UIF. These are the employees who are very  vulnerable  to  unemployment,  as
they cannot be easily absorbed by the labour market. However, we regret  the
fact that this Act will only apply to these workers 12 months after the  Act
is in operation.

The IFP is concerned about the exclusion  of  the  national  and  provincial
public servants in the Bill, as they are also employees. We  would  like  to
see them included in the provisions as employees, just  like  those  in  the
local authorities. The fact that they have other  benefits  does  not  tally
with the argument that they therefore should not be included in  this  Bill.
What is wrong with the enhancement of their benefits if  we  are  determined
to deal with the brain  drain  from  the  Public  Service  presently  taking
place? The  private  sector  siphons  innumerable  skills  from  the  Public
Service, because, in comparison, it pays better  than  the  Government.  The
extension of these benefits can similarly  and  ultimately  serve  to  deter
this exodus of workers.

On the application to receive benefits, we wish to put on record  that  some
applicants fail to receive benefits when their employer  becomes  liquidated
and in many cases, goes underground and even abroad. Such employees  do  not
get issued with blue cards when they go to the  labour  offices.  One  would
believe that  the  proper  course  to  follow  would  be  to  look  for  the
liquidator or the master of liquidation responsible for such liquidation.

Another alternative would be to go to the SA Revenue Service office if  that
applicant is a registered taxpayer,  so  that  these  offices  can  give  an
indication as to what has taken place with their employer, but this  process
can be very tiring and expensive for unemployed people. Most  of  them  will
not even know the right route to follow.

The IFP is also concerned about the fact that a large  number  of  employers
are not registered as employers with Sars, which would  make  the  efficient
collection of such funds, as well as payment of benefits to  the  unemployed
employees, very difficult to implement.

Nevertheless, the IFP supports this Bill.

Dr P J RABIE: Hon Chairman, hon  Deputy  President,  and  hon  members,  the
purpose of this Bill is to fill a particular void in our market  niche,  and
it applies to domestic workers, gardeners, persons employed by  a  household
as a driver and a person who takes care of any person in the home.

A significant aspect of this Bill is that it does  not  include  farmworkers
or public servants. The Act also does  not  apply  to  an  employee  who  is
employed by the employer for less than 24 hours a month.  An  employee  that
receives remuneration under a learnership agreement registered in  terms  of
the Skills Development Act, Act  97  of  1998,  is  also  exempt  from  this
particular Bill. An employee who has entered the country for the purpose  of
carrying out of a contract of service, apprenticeship or  learnership,  with
the undertaking to repatriate after completion of his term  of  service,  is
also excluded from this Bill.

In essence, this Bill refers to domestic  and  seasonal  workers  and  their
employers, and the Bill will come into effect 12 months after this Bill  has
been proclaimed  by  the  President.  The  Bill  determines  the  amount  of
contribution.  The  fact  that   the   employer   deducts   the   employees'
contribution on a monthly basis is also a significant aspect of  this  Bill.
Employers that qualify for this Bill are not liable for the payment  of  the
skills development levy in terms of the Skills Development  Levies  Act  and
the Unemployment Insurance Act. Employers to  whom  this  Act  applies  must
apply for registration to the Unemployment Insurance Commissioner.

The Unemployment  Insurance  Contributions  Bill  is  a  positive  piece  of
legislation, and provides insurance cover to a particular number of  workers
within our labour force. It is a fundamental prerequisite for  sound  labour
relations. What is important, however is the cost of this  particular  Bill,
but in the long term, I think this  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  our
particular economy.

The New NP is proud to support this particular piece of legislation.

Chief M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson, it would be  redundant  for  me  to  repeat
what the hon member G G Oliphant has already mentioned. Suffice  it  to  say
that the Unemployment Insurance Contributions Bill is  linked  to  the  Bill
that was passed by this House some time last year, namely  the  Unemployment
Insurance Bill, the  purpose  of  which  is  to  establish  an  Unemployment
Insurance Fund to which employers and employees contribute, and  from  which
employees who become unemployed, or their beneficiaries,  as  the  case  may
be, are entitled to benefit.  In  so  doing,  this  alleviates  the  harmful
economic and social effects of unemployment.

The purpose of the Unemployment Insurance  Contributions  Bill  is  to  make
provision  for  the  collection  of  contributions  for   the   Unemployment
Insurance Fund. In other words, this Bill, once passed by this  House,  will
be an enabling Act for the  implementation  of  the  Unemployment  Insurance
Fund. The two pieces of legislation complement, in essence, each other,  and
are intended to provide benefits to employees who become unemployed.

I therefore believe that no political party will oppose this Bill.  The  UDM
recommends, however, that  the  splitting  of  collection  of  contributions
between Sars and the Unemployment Insurance Commissioner should be  reviewed
by both the Department of Labour and Sars. We believe that Sars is the  most
effective tax collection agency by all  international  standards,  and  that
all the payroll taxes, including UIF, should be  left  with  Sars.  We  also
recommend that the Director-General of the Department of  Labour  should  be
given powers to appoint an actuary who is a member of the Actuarial  Society
of SA and who is supervised by a  member  of  the  society  to  perform  the
functions assigned to the actuary in terms  of  the  Unemployment  Insurance
Contributions Fund, similar to the functions  assigned  to  the  actuary  in
terms of the Unemployment Insurance Act.

The UDM supports the Bill.

Mr L M GREEN: Mr Chairperson, the ACDP supports  the  general  provision  of
the Bill whereby employees previously disallowed are  now  granted  coverage
within the UIF. This is a good Bill because it addresses the  needs  of  the
poorest of the poor. However,  we  are  concerned  that  the  administration
thereof may prove to be difficult if  the  necessary  procedural  mechanisms
and contribution infrastructure are not fully and efficiently allocated.

The nature of the work  of  especially  domestic  and  seasonal  workers  is
generally seen as contractual  and,  as  such,  the  principle  of  possible
permanent employment and related benefits do not apply.

It  is  therefore  more  important  to  ensure  that  such  employees  enjoy
assurance of good administration. It is equally important for  the  ordinary
employer to fully understand his or  her  responsibility  in  terms  of  the
provisions  laid  down  in  this  legislation.  We  hope   that   sufficient
information will be made available to these employers on  how  to  go  about
ensuring the protection of their workers.

The ACDP supports this Bill.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agb Voorsitter, ter aanvang wil ek dit stel dat  die  VF
hierdie  wetsontwerp  oor  werkloosheidsversekeringsbydrae  steun.  Daar  is
egter twee aspekte waarna gekyk moet  word.  Die  een  aspek,  wat  ons  ook
beskou  as  'n  leemte,  is  as  dit  kom  by  die   uitbetaling   van   die
werkloosheidsversekeringsfonds. Dit is algemeen bekend  dat  daar  mense  is
wat na verskillende betaalpunte gaan en meer  as  net  een  uitbetaling  per
maand ontvang, of wat ook al die uitbetaling  mag  wees  in  terme  van  die
Werkloosheidsversekeringsfonds. Dis 'n leemte waarna daadwerklik gekyk  moet
word.

'n Tweede aspek is dat die Regering van die dag  werksgeleenthede  sal  moet
begin skep. As ons dan kyk na die werkloosheidsyfer vir  verlede  jaar,  was
dit, volgens die eng definisie, 26,4%. Volgens die wyer  definisie  was  dit
37%.  As  ons  nie  werk  gaan  skep  in  hierdie  land  nie,  gaan  ons  'n
sneeubaleffek hê en gaan ons nie die probleem van  werkloosheid  oplos  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Chairperson, firstly I would like to  say  that  the
FF supports this Unemployment Insurance Contributions Bill.  However,  there
are two aspects that need to be examined. The first aspect, which we  regard
as a shortcoming, relates to the paying out of  money  by  the  Unemployment
Insurance Fund. It is generally known that there are people who  go  to  the
various pay offices and receive more than only one  payment  per  month,  or
whatever the payment may be in terms of  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Fund.
This is a shortcoming that calls for thorough examination.

A second aspect is that the present Government will have to  start  creating
job opportunities. When we look at the unemployment figure  for  last  year,
we find that, in terms of strict definition, it was 26,4%. According to  the
wider definition it was 37%. Unless we  create  job  opportunities  in  this
country we will have a snowball effect and be unable to  solve  the  problem
of unemployment.]

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Geagte Voorsitter, die  FA  is  ten  gunste  daarvan  dat
werkers beskerm word deur 'n wet van hierdie aard, maar ons  twyfel  of  dit
die lae-inkomstewerker sal bevoordeel.  Baie  Suid-Afrikaners  wil  werklose
mense in die lae-inkomstegroepe se lot verlig en neem hulle in diens  as  'n
tuinier of 'n huishulp of iets dergeliks. As hierdie werkgewers, wat ook  in
die laer-inkomstekategorie hulle brood verdien, aan  vervolging  blootgestel
gaan word, omdat hulle nie  vir  hulle  huishulp  voorsiening  maak  vir  'n
werkloosheidsfonds nie, dan twyfel ons of hulle daardie mense in  diens  sal
neem.

Dit lei dus daartoe dat hierdie wetsontwerp kan  veroorsaak  dat  'n  sekere
persentasie van die lae-inkomstewerksgeleenthede gaan  verdwyn.  Daarom  sal
ons wil sien hoe  dit  toegepas  word  en  hoop  die  Minister  sal  daaraan
ernstige aandag gee. Ons plaas 'n las op die laags besoldigde groepe in  ons
geledere en ons sal wil sien hoe dit hulle gaan affekteer. Ons hoop dat  die
Minister die toepassing sal monitor en toesien dat dit  meer  werk  aan  die
armes verskaf. Die FA steun graag die wetgewing. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Hon Chairperson, the FA favours workers  being  protected
by a law of this nature, but we doubt whether this will benefit  the  lower-
income workers. Many South Africans want to  alleviate  the  plight  of  the
unemployed in the lower-income group and  they  employ  them  as  gardeners,
domestic workers and so on. If these employers, who are also  earning  their
living in the lower-income category, are  to  be  subjected  to  persecution
because they have not provided for an unemployment fund for  their  domestic
help, we doubt whether they will be employing those people.

It may therefore be that this Bill is going to cause  a  certain  percentage
of the lower-income job opportunities to disappear. We would therefore  like
to see how it is going to be enforced and we hope  that  the  Minister  will
pay serious attention to this. We are placing a burden on  the  lowest  paid
groups among us and we would like to see how this is going to  affect  them.
We hope that the Minister will monitor the enforcement and see  to  it  that
more jobs are made available to the poor. The FA would like to support  this
legislation.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon P J Nefolovhodwe! I am  sorry,
Mr Aucamp!

Mr C A AUCAMP: Chairperson, the anti-defection clause is not in  place  yet.
I am from the AEB. There is only one real kind  of  unemployment  insurance,
that is a  growing  economy  where  unemployment  will  be  reduced  to  the
minimum. The AEB calls on the Minister of  Finance  to  furnish  us  with  a
Budget tomorrow that will stimulate growth.

Die AEB steun hierdie wetgewing. Daar is 'n paar vrae daaroor.  Dit  is  nie
vir ons duidelik waarom die  staat  as  werkgewer  uitgesluit  word  om  ook
werkloosheidsversekering te voorsien nie. Ons beskou dit  as  'n  aantasting
van die regte van die werker. Die regte van die werker  moet  beskerm  word.
Tog weet ons dat dit groot administratiewe laste lê op die werkgewer en  ons
doen 'n beroep op die owerhede om hierdie saak op 'n  verbruikersvriendelike
wyse te hanteer en 'n handige brosjure aan  werkgewers  beskikbaar  te  stel
wat met een oogopslag alle verpligtinge uiteensit.

Hierdie wetgewing bring geen nuwe beginsel ter tafel nie,  maar  reël  slegs
die implementering van 'n wet wat reeds deur hierdie Huis goedgekeur  is  en
die  AEB  ondersteun  dit  met  vrymoedigheid.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The AEB supports this legislation. There are a few questions about  it.  It
is not clear to us why the state, as employer, is  excluded  from  providing
unemployment insurance as well. We regard this as tampering with the  rights
of the worker. The rights of the worker should be  protected.  Yet  we  also
know that this causes a great administrative burden for the employer and  we
appeal to the authorities to deal with this matter in  a  user-friendly  way
and to make a  handy  brochure  available  to  employers,  setting  out  all
obligations at a glance.

This legislation brings no new principle to the table, but merely  regulates
the implementation of an Act which has already been approved by this  House,
and the AEB supports it with confidence.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, and hon members, I  would  like
to thank all members who participated in  this  debate,  particularly  those
who have supported this legislation. Regarding issues that have been  raised
by some members, I would like to remind  members  of  this  House  that  the
issue of the inclusion or otherwise of public servants is not a matter  that
is out of sight. It is a matter that is part of  the  issues  that  will  be
considered between the Minister of Finance and the Minister for  the  Public
Service and Administration.

Subsequently, there will be a report on  this  matter,  after  it  has  been
looked at it from all points of view. Hon members must also understand  that
this matter will have particular financial implications for  the  state.  If
we go along with it, then we must do so with our eyes wide open.

The  issues  around  domestic  and  seasonal  workers  are  covered  in  the
legislation. The Minister of Labour is authorised to  appoint  a  body  that
will investigate the issues. Essentially, we  all  understand,  if  we  have
grown up in South Africa, how the system has worked, for example in  respect
of domestic workers. Members know the difficulties and  practicalities  that
would be  involved  in  administering  a  system  of  contributions  to  the
Unemployment Insurance Fund with respect to domestic workers.  The  Minister
of Labour will appoint this  body  to  investigate  these  issues  within  a
period of 12 months and report in this regard.

On the exclusion of farmworkers, our understanding is that the  category  of
farmworkers that remains excluded for now,  subject  to  the  investigations
that must take place, is that of seasonal workers, but ordinary  farmworkers
are covered by this Bill.

A final point that I would like to make is that the  Unemployment  Insurance
Fund is part of the broader social security system that  we  have  in  South
Africa. Therefore, the measures both in this Bill and  in  the  Unemployment
Insurance  Fund  Act,  aimed  at  improving  both  the  administrative   and
financial capacities, are an important  contribution  to  strengthening  our
social security system. Of  course,  this  is  not  all  that  is  aimed  at
strengthening our social security system. There is also the  work  that  was
done by a committee that was appointed  by  the  Government  to  investigate
issues around the comprehensive social security system. We  hope  to  get  a
report from that committee very soon.

All of these issues are meant to ensure that our system can  cater  for  all
categories of people that need our social security system.  This  Bill  will
make an important contribution in strengthening our social security  system.
[Applause.]

 TOWARDS A SOUND BASIS FOR HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH QUALITY BASIC
                                  EDUCATION

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE: Chairperson,  the  topic  before  this  House  creates  an
environment to measure the distance covered since the  Freedom  Charter  was
adopted by People's Congress in Kliptown in 1955. The Charter  confronts  us
with an important challenge. It says, ``the doors of  learning  and  culture
shall be opened''. In 1948 education was recognised as a basic human  right,
and it was included in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.  This
right is also enshrined in our Constitution.

Education remains central to development,  resulting  in  a  better  quality
life. In 1995 this House passed the South African  Qualifications  Authority
Act, Act 58, popularly known as Saqa.

Saqa provides for the National Qualifications Framework, popularly known  as
the NQF, which establishes the scaffolding of  a  national  learning  system
that integrates education and training, at all  levels,  from  preschool  to
higher education and training and  is  overseen  by  the  SA  Qualifications
Authority. It is answerable to  both  the  Minister  of  Education  and  the
Minister of Labour.  It  facilitates  the  movement  of  learners  from  one
qualification level to another. It encourages flexible  access  by  learners
to different modes of  learning,  be  this  in  learning  institutions,  the
workplace or community learning centres, for example  the  pottery  classes,
the courses that we have for domestic workers or courses for self-study.  We
know that the NGOs and the churches play  a  very  important  role  in  this
regard.

We also think of our world-class heart specialist, Dr Barnard, who  used  to
consult a black man from the Western Cape -  his  name  escapes  me  at  the
moment - who was illiterate but could assist with heart operations. He  knew
which scalpel to use, and he was consulted all  the  time.  His  family,  at
this point in time, really feels that he is  an  unsung  hero.  He  was  not
recognised in the past. I think, with the framework  that  we  have  put  in
place, that can be corrected. With this framework,  we  will  capture  those
that are there.

Basic education can be provided by the formal education system and  informal
education. In this regard I  have  already  mentioned  the  NGOs.  The  main
components  of  basic  education  are  communication  skills   and   general
knowledge, that is, literacy, and scientific  and  cultural  knowledge.  For
our daily life skills practices, we need to be educated, that  is  just,  an
ordinary education. We need to train counsellors to help  with  the  scourge
of HIV/Aids. We need to do it now. This is a challenge  to  all  of  us.  We
have had cholera, and we still have it. Education  plays  a  very  important
role, for example with regard  to  washing  hands.  We  need  to  teach  our
children and everybody to wash their hands.

Production of skills includes  any  activity  enabling  someone  to  earn  a
living or produce goods and services.  There  are  a  number  of  short-term
advantages. These can pose problems as people might regard  basic  education
as inferior education. We have programmes in place  where  certificates  are
awarded at the end of training, for example in  candle-making  for  ordinary
women in our villages in  the  locations,  are  making  yoghurt  and  peanut
butter. But at the end of the day there is no market  for  this  and  it  is
important that we revisit these matters.

Human resource development is one of our  serious  challenges  and  in  this
regard we have this diploma disease. The heavy emphasis on formal  education
has given rise to large-scale unemployment among  qualified  people  because
of a shortage of jobs for educated people. When there is  an  oversupply  of
candidates with a particular qualification, employers may start  asking  for
an unnecessarily high  level  of  education,  creating  a  spiral  known  as
education inflation.

The irony is that the greater the unemployment among the educated, the  more
worthless  their  certificates  and  diplomas  are.  This  is  one  of   the
challenges that we face. The diploma disease is  widening  the  gap  between
what is learnt at school and at university, and the knowledge required in  a
job situation.

The 1988 World Bank Report  suggests  that  the  high  economic  and  social
returns that have accrued be maintained parallel to combating the  incidence
of disease and malnutrition among our children.  There  should  be  training
for those who have entered the labour market and school  learners  who  have
no formal education and training in job-specific skills. We  should  develop
intellectual talent to fill the highest scientific and technical posts.

paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to take this opportunity to let this  House  realise  that  we
have many challenges. President Thabo Mbeki appealed to the members  of  the
ANC and the whole nation that this is the year  of  volunteers.  Voluntarism
has always been there in Setswana tradition and in rural areas,  but  people
seemed to withdraw and expect Government to do everything for them.

We have passed a legislation in the NA to enable the SGBs  to  help  develop
the quality of education in our schools. The challenges  that  we  face  are
that there are instances where a school may be destroyed, not be taken  care
of with, its taps being vandalised and not having proper toilets. There  are
situations in which 1 000 learners share one  toilet  with  their  teachers.
These are some of the things that may  hinder  our  attempt  to  better  the
quality of education and consequently people's future.

I am also concerned about the high illiteracy rate among  our  people,  whom
we expect to  work.  We  all  know  that  most  South  African  workers  are
unskilled. We have passed an Abet legislation which enables us  to  use  the
schools that we have for children during the  day  and  for  adults  in  the
evenings. However, we experience challenges which may result  in  conflicts.
There are more women than men. Women have to go to evening  classes  and  at
the same time they are expected to help children  with  their  homework  and
prepare their clothes and their lunch boxes. This makes  it  impossible  for
them to go to evening classes.

But, this legislation provides that as time  goes  on  we  will  build  more
schools for adults and children to go to school at  the  same  time  because
all South Africans should benefit from the country's resources.

We are also concerned that there is a moral  degeneration  in  our  schools,
both primary and secondary.  Our  children,  especially  girls,  are  abused
sexually. It means in our education ... [Time expired.]]

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers and hon members,  the  Democratic
Alliance is committed to providing relevant and quality  education  for  all
the people. Yet we submit that education  per  se  is  not  about  politics,
politicians, ideology  or  bureaucrats;  it  is  about  learners  and  their
teachers. Education is a means to self-fulfilment and the development  of  a
person's full potential, a means to contribute to  progress  and  prosperity
for the country and its people, a critical  success  factor  in  making  our
country globally competitive.
The Minister of Education, addressing a press briefing on  the  Government's
human resource development strategy in Cape Town  recently,  noted  that  it
was  the  surest  guarantee  to   sustainable   empowerment   and   economic
development. He also noted that the overarching goals of the human  resource
development strategy included improving the human development index for  the
country, a reduction of inequality and improving the  nation's  position  on
the international competitiveness table. This is good news, yet we have  our
serious concerns.

As is the case with many governments, money allocated to education is  often
lost due to the inability  of  officials  to  efficiently  utilise  budgeted
amounts. Allocated money can only  make  a  positive  difference  towards  a
better quality education if it is used to appoint quality teachers;  improve
relevant and on-going support services; provide, improve  and  maintain  the
good condition  of  buildings;  improve  quality  management  services;  and
purchase appropriate learning materials.

We are looking forward to the department getting the wheel turning  for  the
implementation of the ELRC's assistance to  unqualified  and  underqualified
educators, to improve their qualifications  for  better  quality  inputs  in
order that our education system should improve. We hope that there  will  be
no bureaucratic obstacles in the way of this project, as there  are  60  000
teachers waiting for this to happen.

Finally, we need to put  more  effort  into  improving  the  status  of  the
teaching profession if we want  to  attract  suitable  teaching  candidates,
many of whom are lured away by the private sector,  especially  matriculants
with mathematics and science.

Further tarnishing the image of  the  teaching  profession  are  reports  of
widespread corruption, absenteeism, substance abuse  and,  more  lamentable,
learner  abuse.  We  need  a  strong,  effective  partnership  between   the
department, the SA Council of Educators, teacher unions  and  the  community
to stamp out these evils from our schools. [Applause.]

Dr  U  ROOPNARAIN:  Madam  Speaker  and  hon  members,  I  am  honoured   to
participate in this debate, as it is salient, timely  and,  more  important,
as quality education is an indispensable requirement in any  society.  Human
resource is the most important resource in  any  society,  great  or  small,
since it is directly related  to  that  society's  security,  wellbeing  and
prospects for progress. It was B F Skinner who once said that:


  Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten.



How appropriate are these words! they encapsulate sentiments and  objectives
with which we fully identify.

Indeed, all members of this House and all levels of leadership  should  find
new vigour to translate these sentiments into reality.  The  IFP  recognises
that basic education holds the key to a literate, competent  and  prosperous
population. At this juncture I just want to say that we welcome  the  motion
from the ANC and we reaffirm the sentiments therein.

We, as MPs, want to do what is right for the sake  of  this  generation  and
future generations. But a leader only becomes a leader  if  he  or  she  can
lead his or her generation.  He  or  she  becomes  a  figure  of  historical
significance only if he or she is able to deal with questions  that  vex  or
confront that society or that generation. The motion has  to  be  understood
in this context.

Human  resource  development,  or  human  capacity  development   or   human
empowerment, is the skeletal structure that supports the development of  any
nation. In other words, it is about  developing  and  nurturing  this  human
resource base. So the question arises: How do we do this?  It  is  basically
about the citizenry being able to access skills, whether it be  in  science,
technology or commerce, to create a transforming and enabling environment.

Our  country  relies  on  enlightened,  informed,  educated  and  courageous
leaders, and this House  needs  to  encourage  and  cajole  role-players  to
fulfil their responsibility; and  also  to  exact  from  the  Department  of
Education performance, accountability and, most important, delivery.  It  is
about maximising education and skills for the global economy.

The IFP is  convinced  that  policy  formulation  cannot  be  divorced  from
implementation. Once this debate is over it should not be simply seen  as  a
good debate or that this was a good motion, but something needs  to  emanate
from it or else we are engaged in a futile  process,  and  unemployment  and
poverty will begin to erode the political gains that we  have  accomplished.
Thus the choices we make have to be constantly  revisited  and  re-examined.
In essence, if policies are wrong, they should be denounced, or if  policies
are good, they should be glorified. So we need to take  assertive  decisions
with the sole aim of building this resource base. Our premise should  rather
be delivery and not disappointment.

The ideal of human capital investment or capacity-building has to  be  built
in during the very early years of the schooling process  so  that  education
can become functional and foundational. We should not focus  simply  on  the
acquisition of skills but rather on the application of  skills.  It  is  not
about creating a mass-based academia or an intelligentsia but  it  is  about
an employable workforce. To take the debate  a  step  forward,  we  need  to
articulate and inform.

Although we have a huge economic resource base, we need to create a  climate
that is conducive to employment. The Government's track record in this  area
is dismal, with unemployment being close to 30%, the highest in  the  world.
Hence the core of Government and the private sector should rest  heavily  on
the release  of  resources  for  human  capacity-building.  Our  initiatives
should include the setting up of a human  resource  base,  the  granting  of
scholarships, and training programmes and  education  that  begin  to  equip
individuals for being functional members in society.

As legislators we need to subscribe to and make a contribution  towards  the
development of a viable and employable base. For this to happen, we  need  a
conversion of political will. We simply do not need more  policy  documents.
We do not need  more  White  Papers,  nor  do  we  need  pious  or  worn-out
policies. We need to ensure that the climate is conducive. We need  to  take
assertive  decisions  to  implement   policies   that   are   workable   and
implementable. This is the challenge for any genuine democracy.

Our education system, with all its complications,  subtleties  and  nuances,
can become a beacon of hope for those that are illiterate, in  dire  poverty
and unemployed, if we begin to engage now.

So the end of my speech should be the  beginning  of  welding  us  together,
aside from our political persuasions or political ideologies, but a  welding
together to leave behind an investment for our children, so  that  they  can
participate in society, not just as good  citizens  but  as  productive  and
responsible citizens. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, I admire the enthusiasm  of  the  previous
speaker. I see that the hon the Minister is not in the House.  Hopefully  he
is not engaged in a fight against Unisa's chairperson.

The topic for  discussion,  ``Towards  a  Sound  Basis  For  Human  Resource
Development Through Quality Basic Education'', could  not  have  come  at  a
more appropriate time, because currently  South  Africa  is  ranked  at  the
bottom  of  the  human   development   index.   According   to   the   World
Competitiveness Yearbook  2001  South  Africa  is  listed  46th  out  of  48
countries in this regard.

Fortunately, the Government is addressing the situation  through  the  Human
Resource  Development  Strategy  which  was  launched  last  year.  For  the
purposes of this debate I will only concentrate on  two  objectives  of  the
Human  Resource  Development  Strategy,  namely  improving  the  quality  of
general education and improving the  results  in  mathematics  and  science,
starting with the last one  first,  improving  results  in  mathematics  and
science.

South Africa is  still  years  behind  in  this  field,  for  understandable
reasons. The World Competitiveness Yearbook, to which  I  referred  earlier,
ranks South Africa last out  of  49  countries  when  it  comes  to  science
adequately taught in compulsory schools.

With regard to the question whether science  and  technology  interests  the
youth of our country, South Africa is listed second from last,  and  believe
me, it is no consolation at all that the United Kingdom  occupies  the  last
position. That we are nowhere near the objective of  improving  the  results
in mathematics and science is borne out by  the  fact  that  the  number  of
African matric pupils passing higher  grade  mathematics  and  science  last
year, namely 2 751, was lower than the previous year,  namely  3  128.  This
lack of performance needs to be addressed  in  an  imaginative  manner.  The
identification of 102 special mathematics and science schools  in  all  nine
provinces last year was a positive step in the right direction. An audit  of
these schools, however, indicated a lack  of  basic  needs  such  as  power,
laboratories, libraries and learner support materials in general.

It would be appreciated if someone would ask the  Minister  to  indicate  to
the House whether these schools have now been fully  equipped  in  order  to
enhance excellence in science and  mathematics.  More  importantly,  someone
should ask the Minister to indicate  to  the  House  whether  these  schools
have, in the meantime, been provided  with  adequately  qualified  teachers,
without whom excellence in mathematics and science will remain a pipedream.

This brings me to the second objective of  the  human  resource  development
strategy-improving  the  quality  of  general  education.  Adequate  learner
material is a prerequisite for improving the quality of  general  education.
A shortage of textbooks at the beginning of the school year has  once  again
hampered quality basic education. It is now two  months  since  the  schools
have been reopened but in a province such as Mpumalanga, for example,  there
are still schools without textbooks.

'n Tweede  voorvereiste  vir  gehalte  basiese  onderwys  is  goedopgeleide,
gekwalifiseerde onderwysers. 'n  Goedopgeleide,  gekwalifiseerde  onderwyser
vergoed baie  keer  vir  'n  gebrek  aan  ondersteuningsmateriaal.  Daar  is
onderwysers wat onder 'n boom skoolhou en uitstekende resultate behaal.

Die Minister verdien krediet vir die feit dat R30 miljoen opsy gesit  is  om
behoorlik gekwalifiseerde mense na die onderwys toe te lok. Die  bewilliging
van 'n verdere R90 miljoen om  die  kwalifikasies  van  onderwysers  in  die
algemeen te bevorder, is ewe kredietwaardig.

Die pad  na  ontwikkeling  van  menslike  hulpbronne  deur  gehalte  basiese
onderwys is gewis nog 'n lang pad, maar die Chinese spreekwoord  sê  mos  'n
tog van 'n 1000 myl begin met 'n enkele tree. Die Regering  se  ontwikkeling
van 'n menslike hulpbronstrategie was die eerste tree op hierdie  lang  pad.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[A  second  prerequisite  for  quality  basic  education  is   well-trained,
qualified teachers. Most of the time a well-qualified teacher makes  up  for
a lack of support material. There are teachers who  teach  under  trees  and
deliver excellent results.
The Minister deserves credit for the fact that  R30  million  has  been  put
aside to lure suitably qualified people to education. A further R90  million
grant to improve the  qualifications  of  teachers  in  general  is  equally
noteworthy.

The road to development of human resources through quality  basic  education
is indeed still a long one but the Chinese proverb does say that  a  journey
of 1 000 miles begin with one single step. The Government's  development  of
a human  resource  strategy  was  the  first  step  on  this  long  journey.
[Applause.]]

Prof S M MAYATULA: Madam Speaker, hon members, I would like to start off  by
offering an apology on behalf of the hon the Minister. He is definitely  not
engaged in Unisa affairs but is currently in the NCOP, where he is  debating
child abuse issues. We are hoping he will join us.

In this year of letsema, ilima, this year of  Vukuzenzele,  that  is,  Arise
and Act, this year of volunteerism, the ANC, in  its  statement  of  January
8th, made this clarion call to all its members and friends:


  Following today's celebrations, each member of the ANC and  every  branch
  of our movement must participate  in  matsema  (amalima),  that  we  will
  engage in every month. At this time, we must mobilize the people to  join
  in these activities.

I would like to dedicate my speech to a senior school Xhosa teacher  by  the
name of Miss Nomachule Khetso of St  George's  Grammar  School  in  Mowbray,
Cape Town, who visited me in my office yesterday.

True to her African cultural upbringing and  ubuntu,  though  contracted  to
work only 17 hours a week in her school, she  saw  Xhosa  language  learners
without a teacher, and volunteered to teach them for a  whole  year  without
being paid. [Applause.]

Ukuze sibe nombono  ocacileyo  ngendlela  esiza  kuyihamba  ukuya  kwimfundo
egqibeleleyo, masiziqaphele iimeko abaphila phantsi  kwazo  abantu  bakuthi.
Masibe nombono  womama  notata  nabantwana  abathathu  abafundayo:  iintombi
ezimbini, enye ineminyaka elishumi elinesithathu, enye  ineminyaka  elishumi
elinesixhenxe, kanti yena unyana  uneminyaka  elishumi  elinesihlanu.  Bonke
bahlala kwigumbi elinye, etyotyombeni. Eli gumbi yindawo  yokulala,  yindawo
yokuhlambela, yindawo yokutya  ikwayiyo  nendawo  yokuhlala.  Ngaba  imfundo
egqibeleleyo ingakhona kusini na kumntu ohlala apho?

Phindani   nibe   nombono   wosapho   olukwanjengolu,   oluhlala   kwizindlu
eziphangaleleyo kwenye yeelali zaseMqanduli.  Ingxaki  yabo  kukuba  abazali
babo abaphangeli,  ibe  isikolo  singumgama  ongange-khilomitha  ezisixhenxe
ukusuka esikolweni. Lo mgama bawuhamba nge  nyawo  yonke  le  mihla.  Ngenxa
yokungabikho  kweendlela,  esi  sikolo  asifikeleleki  nangemoto  xa   izulu
lisina, nabantwana besikolo bafika bemanzi  toxo.  Isikolo  asinazifesitile,
zingcango,  kunye  nazitulo  zakuhlala.  Umbuzo  ngowokuba,  ingaba  imfundo
egqibeleleyo  ingenziwa  na  kwisikolo  esinjalo.  (Translation   of   Xhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[If we want to have a very clear picture of  the  road  we  have  to  travel
before we reach our destination of  effective  education,  we  need  to  pay
attention to the conditions under which our people live. Let  us  picture  a
mother and a father with three children who are at school:  two  girls,  one
thirteen years old and another seventeen, and a fifteen-year-old  son.  They
all live in one room in a shack.  This  room  serves  as  the  bedroom,  the
bathroom, the diningroom as well as  the  lounge.  Can  there  be  effective
education for someone living here?

Again picture a similar family living in a more spacious  house  in  one  of
the villages at Mqanduli. The problem of the  children  in  this  family  is
that their parents are not working, and that the school is seven  kilometres
away from their home. They travel this distance on  foot  everyday.  Because
of the condition of the roads their school is not  accessible  even  by  car
when it is raining and the children get to school soaking  wet.  The  school
has no windows, no doors and no chairs to sit on. The question then  is:  is
effective education possible at a school like that?]

If one knows the history of our country, one will know why, in this day  and
age, there are people who are still living in such conditions. In his  state
of the nation address on 8 February, the President committed the  Government
to addressing these issues when he said:


  Government will in the current medium-term  expenditure  period  allocate
  the necessary resources to ensure that no child studies under a tree.

I am sure this statement brought  broad  smiles  to  many  people,  and  the
department is determined to rise to the occasion.

The Freedom Charter confronts us with an important challenge when  it  says,
`` The doors of learning and culture shall be  opened.''  According  to  the
ANC's January 8 statement:


  ... this requires that  we  continue  to  concentrate  on  the  issue  of
  education at all levels and among all its forms. In particular,  we  will
  have to focus on the issue of quality of  education  and  training  given
  both to youth and adults.''

To that end, for the first time in the history of this country, the  ANC-led
Government is in the process of rolling out an early  childhood  development
programme to cater even for the preschool children. This will  give  a  firm
foundation for the quality of education.

The  final  report  on  the  International  Benchmarking  of   1999   Senior
Certificate Examinations by the Scottish Qualification  Authority  concluded
that,  ``...  the  standards  and  quality  of  the  South  African   Senior
Certificate Examination was comparable to the best in the world.''

The  target  of  2004  is  an   SA   Qualifications   Authority   accredited
qualification called the General Education  and  Training  Certificate.  Our
Grade 9 students will get an exit certificate.  Success  in  this  endeavour
will provide access to further education and training for learners. I  would
refer to this as technical schools  for  learners.  It  will  contribute  to
redressing the past educational  injustices,  facilitate  the  move  towards
equity in the education system, and enhance the overall quality of  teaching
and learning.

Last year, in line with section 29 of the Constitution,  this  House  passed
the Adult Basic Education Act, which empowers our  communities  to  call  on
the Government to provide adult basic education-related resources.

The whole school evaluation process helps to facilitate the  involvement  of
all stakeholders in the vision, mission, and assessment  of  the  school  in
the spirit of Vukuzenzele. Continuous assessment  is  adding  value  to  the
quality  of  the  education  system  in  our  country.  On  the  information
technology front, Microsoft has committed itself  to  donating  software  to
our schools.

In response to the hon Geldenhuys, I want to address myself to the  National
Strategy for Mathematics, Science and Technology Education. In  response  to
the  President's  Human  Resource  Development  Strategy,  the  Council   of
Education  Ministers  has  approved  the  establishment  of  102   dedicated
secondary schools for mathematics and science. The project was  launched  on
25  June  2001.  This  national  strategy  revolves  around  three  thrusts:
Firstly,  to  raise  the  participation  and  performance  of   historically
disadvantaged  learners  in  senior  certificate  mathematics  and  physical
science;  secondly,  to  provide  high-quality  mathematics,   science   and
technology education for all learners taking  the  first  General  Education
and Training Certificate; and thirdly, to increase  and  enhance  the  human
resource capacity to deliver quality  mathematics,  science  and  technology
education.

The hon Geldenhuys should note that  funds  are  put  aside  for  this.  The
project will be implemented over a three-year period at an approximate  cost
of R105 million. This project will go a long way in producing  learners  who
are well prepared to enter careers which require  mathematics  and  science.
Despite the hurdles that I referred to and the kind  of  places  from  which
our people come as they go to these schools -  for  example,  in  the  urban
areas children are moved around in buses whilst  in  the  rural  areas  they
travel long distances without any mode of transport -  there  are  plans  in
place and policies that are geared to changing  the  situation  around.  The
ANC-led Government is committed and is in the process of doing just that.

I think one cannot leave this podium  without  saying  something  about  the
report of the National Working Group to the Minister  of  Education  on  the
restructuring of the higher education system in  South  Africa.  The  bottom
line is that there is  general  consensus  on  the  need  for  restructuring
higher institutions. It is very important to realise that both the  ANC  and
the Department of Education have not yet pronounced on this report. What  we
now have on the table are recommendations by the National Working Group.  It
is just a report by the working group, and nothing more.  Hon  members  will
remember the CHE report on institutions such  as  bedrock  institutions  and
others, which was changed in the final analysis.

Public outcry  is  necessary  and  healthy  in  a  democratic  society.  Hon
members' comments and those of the public will assist in crafting the  final
document, which we all hope will be accepted by all of us as we  change  the
way our institutions are currently working.

This is the year of volunteerism. This is the year in which we call  on  all
our people to assist the Government. I  want  to  think  particularly  about
adult basic education. Most of us, one way or another, are a step  ahead  of
some of the people on the ground. If  we  can  all  make  this  problem  our
problem and assist in whatever way  in  order  to  improve  the  quality  of
education for both our children  and  adults,  the  human  resource  of  our
country is going to be improved. [Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker,  I  am  sure  the  apology  extended  by  Prof
Mayatula on behalf of the Minister of Education is acceptable to all of  us.
But I still believe that the Deputy Minister of Education could  have  shown
some interest in this motion.

One of the stated priorities of the  Tirisano  campaign,  launched  in  July
1999 by the hon the Minister of Education, is the elimination of  illiteracy
among adults and the youth by the year 2004. Another is the  creation  of  a
further education and training system, called a FET system, to  equip  youth
and adults to meet the social and economic needs of the 21st century.  These
two  aims  constitute  an  important  consideration  in  any  discussion  of
creating a sound basis for human resource development through quality  basic
education. We have now passed the halfway mark in this five-year  programme,
and it is perhaps time to assess the progress made towards these goals.

Progress in these twin endeavours should be  reported  on  if  the  Minister
wishes us to believe that these goals will  be  met  in  the  time  schedule
determined for the projects. Our democracy is in its eighth year and it  has
to rise to the  challenges  of  a  fast-changing  world.  Changes  in  world
economics and  the  effects  of  rapid  advances  made  in  the  information
technology sector in a shrinking world are  placing  increasing  demands  on
the people of every country, and we have to rise to the occasion or be  left
to find a place in the inevitable  ranks  of  mendicant,  hapless  countries
that will forever need  support  from  a  ``Big  Brother''.  To  meet  these
challenges, our people must be suitably equipped with  the  skills  required
for competing in the modern world.

In this context, if South Africa intends becoming a world-class nation,  the
focus of learners must be fixed on learning.  Anything  that  detracts  from
this, or blurs  this  focus,  must  be  swiftly  dealt  with,  such  as  the
incidence of sexual  violence  and  abuse  in  our  schools,  or  slackness,
absence and corruption among educators. There are too  many  good  educators
around us to allow the profession to be sullied by a few.  The  department's
campaign to encourage people to blow the whistle on abuse  in  schools  must
be given the backing it deserves. It is  only  through  the  involvement  of
communities that a problem such as this can be adequately addressed.  It  is
hoped that tough action will  be  taken  against  those  who  exploit  their
positions of trust in the school situation.

It is encouraging to observe the role played by SABC  Education.  Radio  can
reach almost everybody in the country. Literacy, numeracy  and  life  skills
can be effectively imparted via  this  medium.  The  use  of  television  is
limited to the extent  of  electrification,  particularly  in  rural  areas.
Learners in rural areas suffer a  tremendous  disadvantage  because  of  the
lack of electricity and electronic media,  particularly  at  their  schools.
Perhaps intensifying action towards resolving this problem may prove a  more
worthwhile pursuit for the Minister than listening to people who are  toying
with the future of struggle universities  such  as  the  University  of  the
Western Cape and the University of Durban-Westville.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker,  according  to  the  UN  Development  Programme
Human Index of 2001, South Africa ranks 94th out  of  106  countries.  South
Africa's greatest latent asset is its human potential. I  believe  that  our
country's human potential index is currently  below  its  human  development
index.

By  human  potential  we  refer  to  the  emotional,  intellectual,  social,
community  and  moral  qualities  of  our   people.   South   Africans   are
undernurtured in their human potential but we can do much better to  improve
on our human development index. I am of the  opinion  that  human  potential
proportionately impacts upon human development according to the strength  of
its growth. We all know that South Africa has  the  potential  to  become  a
great  nation.  We  have  the  educational  infrastructure  to  do  so.  Our
geographical infrastructure is adequate enough to provide stability for  our
economic requirements. We have the political dispensation within  which  our
democracy  can  mature.  We  have  managed  to  raise  the  level   of   our
international status and relevance.

Our disposition to undervalue our collective heritage must be addressed.  We
do not adequately embrace the full spectrum of our  national  diversity.  We
have not yet fully paved the way towards finding unity and strength  through
diversity. In this regard we have  undervalued  our  capacity  to  become  a
united nation.

The wealth of human resource development therefore seems to be  in  creating
the right environment in which human potential can be positively  unleashed.
Education is the primary sphere through which human  potential  is  nurtured
towards human development and ultimately towards human wealth and  capacity.
If, however, the  educational  environment  or  sphere  is  under-resourced,
devoid of values and discipline, and operates within  a  vacuum  of  minimal
hope for the future, human underdevelopment will likely occur more rapidly.

Finally, South Africa has the potential to become one of the most  developed
nations of the world.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, hon members,  unemployment  and  joblessness
continue to soar in  this  country,  and  the  blame  can  be  put  on  poor
education and training. In light of the  rising  joblessness,  South  Africa
has to concern herself with the emphasis on training the workforce to  avoid
a  situation  as  described  by  Mark  Blaug  in  his  book  Education   and
Unemployment,  in  which  he  writes  about  educated,  yet  unemployed  and
unemployable people.

We cannot sit back and look on as our education system continues to fail  to
produce appropriately skilled and motivated young workers.  To  continue  to
emphasise the promotion  of  equality  of  opportunity  at  the  expense  of
vocationalism does not serve the situation.

We in the UCDP argue that  education  should  be  concerned  with  promoting
economic growth through concentrating on the basic skills  required  by  the
workforce and industry. To that end, when and where we governed, we  put  up
manpower centres to train young and old in basic skills of life. This was  a
decisive measure towards human resource development.

The manpower centres at Mabopane, Mmabatho  and  ThabaNchu  fell  under  the
former department of manpower, the equivalent of the present-day  Department
of Labour. They did not place emphasis on academic entrance  qualifications.
Emphasis was outcomes based, that is, the product must be qualified.

It is unfortunate that  the  centres  have  been  turned  into  conventional
colleges  that  emphasise  matric  exemption   for   admission   when   even
universities  are  lowering  the  flag  in  the  admission  policies   where
circumstances permit.

If we hope to have a sound human resource base, it should be borne  in  mind
that  basic  education  should  include  mathematics,  science,   geography,
technology and some  foreign  languages.  We  may  also  take  a  leaf  from
Britain's technical and vocational education  initiative,  which  lays  down
that secondary school curricula should include work experience, so  that  on
completion learners can readily get jobs, carry them out  successfully,  and
thus gain a better understanding of work and the economy.
Similar exercises were followed  with  great  success  by  the  late  Julius
Nyerere of Tanzania, with his ``Ujamaa programmes''.

The existing co-operation  between  the  Department  of  Education  and  the
Department of Labour should be  strengthened  and  maintained  so  that  the
products of Department of Education are  received  with  open  arms  by  the
Department of Labour by being placed in jobs.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, there are very  few  countries  in  the  world
which  have  been  subjected  to  arrested  development  for   nearly   four
centuries. Education was, for the most part, neglected, leaving  it  to  the
churches and other religious bodies to  offer  education  as  some  form  of
charity. It must be accepted that churches offered  education  primarily  to
make it easy for their new recruits to  be  able  to  read  and  fathom  the
scriptures and to sing hymns.

The  assault  of  Bantu  education  was  a  further  crippling  development,
undermining self-respect and narrowing the global vision.  It  goes  without
saying that complete change and revolution had to begin in the classroom.
Countries such as Cuba, India and Tanzania,  to  mention  but  a  few,  that
today  can  afford  to  export  human   resources   and   expertise,   began
transformation by investing liberally in education.

Education is not just one of the competing spheres for  state  funding;  no,
it is the primary sphere. If money is not invested  fully  in  education,  a
country will remain backward for a very long  time.  Education  is  the  one
need which is the sine qua non for transformation and development.

The state should invest liberally in good education, for say 20 years;  then
it will have produced adequate human resources to  ``man''  its  development
programme. Without human  resources,  development  cannot  happen,  even  if
money is available. Development requires capacity to  turn  money  resources
into progress and development.

Education must be reformed from the base.  A  good  preschool  programme  is
essential, instead of neglecting  our  early  childhood  education,  because
that is where we have to start. The tendency is always to look  at  tertiary
education first,  then  high  school,  then  primary  school  and  preschool
education comes last. This is the temptation of the short-cut route  and  it
does not  work.  The  country  must  adopt  a  deliberate  policy  of  using
education as a leverage for development and transformation. [Time expired.]

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Madam Speaker, central to the  success  of  human  resource
development through quality basic education is the setting  of  clear  goals
and targets. Goal-setting assists in conveying a sense of urgency. It  helps
to  sustain  the  attention  and   focus   of   learners,   evaluators   and
practitioners on meeting the needs of targeted clients.

For South Africa education is central to economic prosperity.  At  the  same
time, it aims to improve the quality of the lives of its  people.  For  this
reason, South Africa is seriously investing  in  education.  Under  the  ANC
Government, education expenditure has increased from R31,8 billion  in  1994
to R51,1 billion in the year 2000, an increase of 60%.

This demonstrates the undying commitment of this  Government  to  education.
This kind of budget will further enable poor citizens  of  this  country  to
access quality education at all levels.
Budget allocations in most provinces over the past  three  years  have  also
increased significantly, particularly in the poorer provinces  such  as  the
Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and the Northern Province.

Though the budget is not enough to cater for  all  the  learning  materials,
what is more important for me  and  any  other  citizen  is  the  fact  that
education is indeed receiving the serious attention it  demands,  especially
now that provincial governments are  treating  education  with  the  special
urgency it deserves.

Therefore, the issue of education poses a challenge to Government,  parents,
teachers and communities at large. For a child to get ready to  receive  the
quality education we are talking about, he or she must have a relaxed  mind,
that is, he or she  must  not  be  disturbed  by  domestic  violence  or  be
subjected to any form of abuse - hence the outlawing of corporal  punishment
in schools by our Government.

Community  participation  is  encouraged  through  school-governing  bodies.
These bodies should not just play a ceremonial role.  They  must  contribute
meaningfully so that every party plays its role. To  be  able  to  do  that,
they need to be capacitated through training in  order  to  understand  that
role.

On the other hand, the Government must ensure that reasonable  and  adequate
resources are allocated to improve  working  conditions  for  teachers.  For
instance, I do not condone  late-coming  and  absenteeism  on  the  part  of
teachers, but we must be realistic in some cases. When a teacher  lives  far
away from school, lateness becomes a regular occurrence, especially  in  the
rural areas where transport causes severe  problems.  This  will  inevitably
disturb the quality education we all long for.

The above-mentioned points put a challenge to Government. We  need  to  look
at the possibility of  providing  accommodation  for  teachers,  within  the
school premises, with services such as water and electricity provided.  This
will give teachers enough time to prepare for their  work  without  worrying
about time and  transport.  Quality  time  to  prepare  results  in  quality
education offered, remains my belief.

The Department of Education has correctly identified one of many  hindrances
to the provision of basic quality education. As statistics show,  about  23%
of the teacher population is categorised as unqualified and  underqualified.
This means  that  they  are  below  the  required  norm  for  professionally
qualified educators. If  such  a  population  is  not  fully  fortified  and
equipped to deal with the  learners'  problems,  the  process  of  providing
quality education will, no doubt, suffer a severe defeat.

Therefore, it is good that Government is doing something  to  address  these
inequalities of the past. A programme is now in place  to  register  11  000
educators in April 2002. The programme seek to accomplish that by 2004,  50%
of  these  teachers   will   have   received   professional   and   academic
qualifications to enable  them  to  improve  the  quality  of  teaching  and
learning in schools.

When talking about education we often  forget  that  old  people,  too,  are
beneficiaries of education. This Government has shown that  it  does  indeed
represent all the people of South  Africa,  black,  white,  young  and  old.
Delivering  literacy  services  to  nearly  6  million  people  regarded  as
functionally illiterate is one delivery that should never go  unnoticed.  If
such things keep happening, we are  gradually  moving  away  from  what  the
President called our painful past, which he said  we  must  move  away  from
through our policies.

The South  African  education  system  has  been  criticised  for  producing
students and graduates who do not meet the  labour  market's  demands,  with
the emphasis being on the lack of skills  in  mathematics  and  science.  As
Prof Mayatula has already indicated, we are now moving away from the past.

The Department of  Education  and  the  Department  of  Labour  are  working
together to disburse the National Skills Fund through  the  distribution  of
bursaries and loans. Levels of participation  in  mathematics,  science  and
technology are  now  being  raised  through  the  mathematics,  science  and
technology strategy. About 300 teachers per  province  in  the  intermediate
and senior phases will be receiving intensive training  in  mathematics  and
science. These schools will further receive basic scientific  equipment.  We
are indeed heading in the right direction.

It is also encouraging to note that something is done  for  early  childhood
development. Cabinet has already approved a White Paper  for  implementation
as from 2002. Children in poor and rural areas at the age of  five  will  be
targeted for the first phase. A  human  resource  development  strategy  has
projected that at least 1 million five-to-six-year-olds will have access  to
early childhood development programmes by 2005 and 2006.

This again demonstrates the fact that  Government  means  business  when  it
says education for all. These programmes and others,  such  as  prioritising
the HIV/Aids awareness campaign,  are  there  to  transform  our  goals  and
objectives into reality. But I would like to further state that  Government,
through legislation, is trying to maintain, if not better, the standards  of
education. The Council of  Educators  Act  of  2000  seeks  to  protect  the
dignity and the integrity of the teaching profession. But let  the  teachers
be advised, though, that legislation can only do so much. The  bigger  chunk
of work should be done by teachers, learners and parents.

Tendencies such as drinking at work,  deliberate  late-coming  and  sleeping
with schoolchildren do not make and have  never  made  any  teacher  a  good
teacher. It surely does not contribute to providing quality  education.  All
it does is diminish and plunder all the efforts good  teachers  are  putting
into their work. Government should be encouraged, therefore, to keep up  the
good work of continuous improvement of the teaching  industry.  Dictated  to
by the  limited  resources  we  should,  where  we  can,  continue  to  give
incentives to teachers for good work done.  This  will,  in  the  long  run,
restore the pride and  dignity  that  most  teachers  have  lost.  If  these
programmes  do  not  yield  the  intended  results  I  hope  nothing   will.
[Applause.]

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mev die Speaker,  menslike  ontwikkeling  gaan  hand  aan
hand met kwaliteitonderwys en -opleiding. Dit is hoe ek  die  tema  verstaan
wat die ANC vanmiddag op die Tafel plaas. Wanneer hierdie  konsep  deur  die
ANC  gepropageer  word,  moet  en  kan  die  opleiding  nie  los  staan  van
moedertaalkommunikasie en toegewyde onderwysers nie. Dit is jammer, maar  ek
het vandag nog niemand gehoor praat oor daardie eerste vyf jaar van 'n  kind
se lewe nie.

'n Mens kan maar in die Suid-Afrikaanse geskiedenis van die nyweraars  terug
gaan en kyk. Ek kom van die Oosrand  en  60%  van  die  mense  wat  hul  eie
besighede of industrieë besit, het dit gemaak sonder dat  hulle  'n  diploma
of 'n graad het. Aan daardie mense moet ons ook aandag gee  as  ons  hierdie
land en sy menslike hulpbronne wil ontwikkel. Daarom is  dit  belangrik  dat
ons gaan kyk na die kind in sy eerste vyf jaar, watter  vaardighede  hy  het
en dit ontwikkel. Hoeveel van ons sien nie byvoorbeeld die  Pollocks  as  'n
krieketspelende familie nie? Hulle het dit nie  geleer  voor  die  televisie
nie. Hulle is van kleinsaf geleer hoe om 'n bal te vang, hoe om hom te  gooi
en te slaan. Dit geld ook vir meeste ander terreine van die  lewe.  Ons  sal
daarna moet kyk as ons Suid-Afrika se menslike hulpbronne wil verbeter.

Wat van die uiterste belang is, is die taalgebruik en die kwaliteit van  die
persoon wat ook die opleiding van daardie kinders moet waarneem. Vir ons  in
die DA is dit belangrik dat ons begin by die onderwyser. Ons moet praat  van
die aandag wat hy moet gee, die man of vrou wat die kind en  die  volwassene
se  vaardighede  moet  verbeter  met  lees,  skryf  en  somme  maak.  So  'n
onderwyser moet geduld hê. Sy moet liefde  vir  haar  werk  hê  en  moet  'n
leerling kan inspireer om self te werk.  So  'n  onderwyser  moet  kan  werk
sonder dat die President, die Minister of die skoolinspekteur  hom  of  haar
moet dreig om by die skool of die kollege te  wees  tydens  werktyd.  As  'n
pedagoog nie aan hierdie vereistes wil voldoen nie,  dan  moet  hy,  in  die
President se woorde, nie in ons diens wees nie.

Ons moet  verstaan  dat  as  ons  Afrika  leiding  wil  gee  om  in  hierdie
millennium sy plek vol te staan en self sy mense uit  armoede  uit  te  lei,
ons nie deurlopend  die  geskiedenis  en  die  Weste  kan  blameer  vir  ons
agterstand nie. Ons moet onderwysers  voor  die  klaskamers  plaas  wat  met
liefde en ywer kinders sal inspireer om hard te werk en  te  presteer.  [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam speaker, human development goes hand in  hand  with
quality education and training. This is how I  understand  the  theme  which
the ANC tabled this afternoon. When this concept is propagated by  the  ANC,
education  should  not  and  cannot   be   detached   from   mother   tongue
communication and dedicated teachers. It is a  pity,  but  I  have  not  yet
heard anyone this afternoon speak about those first five years of a  child's
life.

One can but go back in the South African history of  the  industrialist  and
have a look. I come from the East Rand and 60% of the people who  own  their
own businesses or industries have made it without  having  a  diploma  or  a
degree. We should also give attention to these people if we want to  develop
this country and its human resources. It  is  therefore  important  that  we
look at the child in its first five years, which  skills  he  has  and  then
develop those skills. How many of us do not, for example, see  the  Pollocks
as a cricket-playing family? They did not learn this by sitting in front  of
the television. From a very young age they were taught how to catch a  ball,
how to throw it and how to hit it. This is also  applicable  to  many  other
areas of life. We should look at this if we want to  improve  South  African
human resources.

What is of the utmost importance is the language usage and  the  quality  of
the person who also has to observe the training of those  children.  For  us
in the DA it is important that we start with the  teacher.  We  should  talk
about the attention that teacher should be giving,  the  man  or  woman  who
should improve the skills of the child and the adult with  reading,  writing
and arithmetic. Such a teacher should have patience.  She  should  love  her
work and should be able to inspire a pupil to  work  independently.  Such  a
teacher should be able to work without the President, the  Minister  or  the
School Inspector having to threaten the teacher to be at school  or  college
during working hours. If an educationist does not want to comply with  these
requirements then he should,  in  the  President's  words,  not  be  in  our
service.

We should understand that if we want to give guidance to Africa to take  its
place in this millennium and to lead its people out of  poverty,  we  cannot
continue to blame the history and the West for our backlog.  We  should  put
teachers in front of the classrooms who will inspire children with love  and
diligence to work hard and to excel. [Time expired.]]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, South Africa is a country rich in all  sorts  of
resources, from minerals to agriculture and tourism, but human resources  is
the x-factor without which all the others  mean  nothing.  Furthermore,  the
most basic contributor to a rich pool of human resources is education.

Maar nou maak ons dikwels 'n fout wanneer ons sê dat opvoeding gelyk is  aan
die skool. Ons vergroot die fout verder as ons sê die  skool  is  gelyk  aan
die staat. Dit is verkeerd. Ons tema praat van ``basic  education''  en  die
mees basiese ontwikkelaar van menslike hulpbronne bly die ouerhuis.  Gesonde
basiese onderwys en opvoeding is in die eerste plek geleë  in  'n  atmosfeer
tuis waarin die kind met al sy  gawes  kan  ontwikkel  en  gedy.  Daarom  is
faktore soos die bestryding van armoede,  effektiewe  behuising  en  basiese
gesondheid net so belangrik soos die kennis waarmee die kind toegerus  word.
Daarvoor is ook 'n stabiele gemeenskapslewe nodig, tesame met dissipline  en
respek, van vroeg af.

Natuurlik is dit so dat die ouerhuis nie  hierdie  taak  alleen  kan  verrig
nie. Daarom word hierdie verantwoordelikheid aan die skool  toevertrou,  let
wel, ``toevertrou'' en nie ``afgestaan'' nie. Daarom  is  'n  ooreenstemming
tussen skool en ouerhuis absoluut noodsaaklik; anders  kweek  ons  kulturele
of  religieuse  skisofrene.  Ons  skole  mag  nie  bloot   produksiemasjiene
produseer nie, maar hulle moet heel mense produseer, mense wat  toegerus  en
bekwaam is om hul man en  vrou  te  staan  in  'n  mededingende  wêreld  van
inligting en tegnologie. Dit moet ook  mense  wees  wat  in  balans  is  met
hulself, hul omgewing en hul medemens. Laasgenoemde is  nie  bloot  algemene
waarhede nie, maar verankerd in kultuur, geloof en waardes. Slegs hy wat  sy
eie waardeer, kan respek hê vir dié van die ander.

Die AEB wil hierdie debat gebruik om 'n appèl aan die  regering  te  rig  om
onderwys in Suid-Afrika só te fasiliteer dat ons kinders vleuels  en  ankers
sal hê; vleuels om die mededingende wêreld met sterk vlerke binne  te  gaan,
stewig verankerd in lewenswaardes, geleer aan moedersknie, om koers  te  hou
op  vlug  deur  hierdie  wêreld.  [Applous.]   (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[However,  we  often  make  a  mistake  by  saying  that  education   equals
schooling. We increase the mistake by saying that the  school  is  equal  to
the state. This is wrong. Our theme talks of basic education  and  the  most
basic developer of human resources remains the parental  home.  Sound  basic
education is firstly situated in the atmosphere at home in which  the  child
can develop with all its gifts and do well. Therefore, factors such  as  the
fight against poverty, effective  housing  and  basic  health  are  just  as
important as the knowledge with which the child is  equipped.  For  this,  a
stable community life  is  also  necessary,  together  with  discipline  and
respect from an early age.

Naturally, it is a fact that the parental home cannot  solely  perform  this
task. Therefore this responsibility  is  entrusted  to  the  school,  please
note, entrusted and not yielded. Therefore, an agreement between the  school
and the parental home is  absolutely  necessary;  otherwise  we  will  raise
cultural or religious schizophrenics. Our schools  may  not  simply  produce
production machines, but they must produce  whole  people,  people  who  are
equipped and competent to take a stand as men and  women  in  a  competitive
world of information and technology. These must also be people  who  are  in
balance with themselves, their environment and their  fellow  human  beings.
The latter are not simply  common  truths,  but  are  anchored  in  culture,
religion and values. Only he who values his own can have respect  for  those
of another.

The AEB would like to use  this  debate  to  appeal  to  the  Government  to
facilitate education in South Africa in such a way that  our  children  have
wings and anchors; wings to enter the competitive world with  strong  wings,
securely anchored in the values of life, learnt at mother's knee,  in  order
to stay on course on their flight through this world. [Applause.]]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, education by itself  is  meaningless  if
it is not geared to improving the conditions of those who are  disadvantaged
by virtue of living in material circumstances that  make  it  impossible  to
receive  quality  basic  education.  At  the  same  time,  education  is  an
instrument or tool that, if used properly, can transform  society,  as  well
as servicing the developmental needs of  communities  and  particularly  the
poor.

Given the fact that in the South African context, those who are not able  to
receive  basic  education  are  those  who  were,  by  law   or   tradition,
discriminated against and dehumanised, and who in  the  process  lost  their
dignity and self-worth, quality basic education should  address  these  ills
of the past.

Therefore, quality basic education should be in a position  to  address  the
individual and collective deprivations of groups and cultural restrictions.

Education should develop the capacities of particularly poor people so  that
they can gain power and be able to take decisions favourable  to  their  own
wellbeing; to take and compel or influence others, including Parliament,  to
act in their favour; bargain from a position of strength; sustain what  they
have achieved; and to manage  their  own  affairs.  More  importantly,  they
should be conscious of their reality and their position in society.

Quality basic education in this context of  South  Africa  should  gear  our
people, young and old, to shoulder  the  responsibility  of  redressing  the
inequalities of the past. [Time expired.]

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, many academics and politicians spend a  great  deal
of time debating what makes a good education system and why  South  Africa's
education is so bad when compared to other countries in the  world  who  are
no wealthier than we are. For me the discussion  is  not  about  complicated
academic theories. It is about the basics, about having  dedicated  teachers
in the classroom, at the right time,  with  the  books  and  materials  they
need.

The Eastern Cape is a shocking example of what is going  wrong.  The  matric
pass rate plunged last year. There are 19  schools  that  had  a  zero  pass
rate. Now the question is: Why is this the case and what went wrong?  It  is
because teachers often do not have the right qualifications for  their  job,
and even if they do, they do not care. Rather than  teach,  they  prefer  to
sit in the sun or in the shebeen. Those who do care - and I do not  want  to
suggest that they do not exist  -  have  to  battle  without  textbooks  and
stationery, because these have not been delivered.

Getting education right means getting the  basics  right.  It  means  making
sure that there are consequences  for  teachers  who  sexually  abuse  their
students, and for principals who refuse to  take  responsibility  for  their
schools and allow teachers and  pupils  to  wander  around  during  teaching
time. It means making an unambiguous commitment to get  books  delivered  to
the schools on the first day of school, even if this  means  that  officials
have to work over weekends.  It  means  tackling  Sadtu,  which  insists  on
holding congresses during school time. It means all these difficult things.

I would like to  see  a  pledge  from  every  teacher  and  every  education
official that they will get these things right. Otherwise, we will  stay  at
the botton of the world rankings forever. [Applause.]

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Chairperson, the beginning of the  school  year  in
2002 has been characterised by two significant events, which laid the  basis
for making our schools work effectively.
In the first place, we restarted our activities in  our  schools  after  the
attainment of the  best  matric  results  in  our  country  for  some  time.
Secondly, we restarted our schools  with  the  inspirational  sight  of  our
President, leading from the front,  visiting  schools  and  volunteering  to
make some contribution to the opening of the school year and calling on  all
South Africans to provide their services on a voluntary basis  to  make  our
schools work.

When the ANC came to power in 1994, it  declared  education  a  basic  human
right. In section 29 of our Constitution  we  declared  ``everyone  has  the
right to a basic education, including adult basic education''. I think  that
in  addressing  the  issue  of  basic  education,  we   must   clarify   our
understanding of basic education. The Oxford  English  dictionary  describes
``basic  education''  as  ``a  return  to  the  fundamental  principles   in
education''. The dictionary  goes  on  to  refer  to  the  teaching  of  the
fundamentals of reading, writing and arithmetic. It also refers to a ``back-
 to-basics movement''.

In  1994  we  had  a  situation  in  which  millions  of   South   Africans,
disadvantaged by the ravages of the apartheid  system,  could  not  read  or
write. Millions of disadvantaged black children were out of school, and  did
not have the most basic education which would ensure  their  survival  in  a
globally competitive world.

Due to the lack in this most basic educational need, the ANC Government  had
to implement very urgent and well-considered interventions  to  transform  a
very disparate and, may I say, desperate situation.

Therefore, the education policies of the ANC emphasised  the  importance  of
providing quality basic education for  all  of  our  citizens.  It  regarded
capacities  such  as  literacy,  numeracy,  critical  thinking,   conceptual
imagination, and communication skills as central to individual and  national
development.

Today we can say with confidence that our Government has provided  universal
general education to the masses of our people. It is a major  accomplishment
that today all children of school-going age are in school on  the  basis  of
the Government's policy of compulsory education.

It is not common in developing countries that the majority of girl  children
are in school. But, indeed, in the past  seven  years  this  Government  has
managed to ensure that a very high percentage of girls  are  also  receiving
compulsory education.  Therefore,  the  Government  is  providing  free  and
compulsory education to the poor.

Through  a  concerted  programme  of  redress,  equity  and  human  resource
development, our Government has  succeeded  in  producing  the  best  matric
results over a considerable period of time.  Last  year's  60%  matric  pass
rate constituted an important milestone in the progress  towards  a  quality
education system. It was also very encouraging that in  last  year's  matric
results, despite what Mr Lee has said, the number of  dysfunctional  schools
dropped by half. Mr Lee referred to 19 schools  with  zero  matric  results,
but he did not say that we had halved the number of schools which  had  zero
matric results. So, he does not even  see  a  half-full  glass;  he  sees  a
totally empty one.

The 2001 matric results were, therefore, the culmination of our  efforts  to
provide quality basic education to  all  our  citizens.  However,  the  good
results did not only come about as a result of what we considered  good  and
effective policies. The  ANC  Government  had  to  be  brutally  frank  with
itself, and often had to put its hand deep into its own bosom. For  example,
in 1996 the ANC Government embarked on a bold and introspective analysis  of
school facilities as they existed at that time throughout the  country.  The
Government  compiled  a  Schools  Register  of  Needs,  which  provided   an
important benchmark for addressing  historical  inequalities.  This  Schools
Register of Needs revealed that in 1996 schools historically  serving  white
learners  were  well  resourced  with  libraries,   computer   centres   and
scientific laboratories.

On the other hand, the Schools Register of Needs indicated that in 1996  one
in four black schools had no water within walking distance.

Over half of all black schools  had  no  electricity.  Over  half  of  those
schools had pit latrines for toilets.  There  were  no  effective  education
resources in 73% of those schools, and 69% had no learning materials.

However, since  then  the  Government  has  made  considerable  progress  in
decreasing these inequalities. The School Register  of  Needs  in  the  year
2000 reported less overcrowding in institutions overall, with a  decline  in
the average number of learners to a classroom from 43 in 1996 to 35  in  the
year 2000. Classroom shortages  decreased  dramatically.  There  was  a  68%
improvement in the provision of sanitation. Whereas 59% of  schools  had  no
telephones in 1996, this was reduced to 34% in 2000.

Despite these encouraging improvements, the ANC Minister of Education,  Prof
Kader Asmal, was bold and forthright in a brutally honest assessment of  the
state of education in 1999. He  candidly  declared  that  despite  excellent
policies and laws, large parts of the system were  seriously  dysfunctional,
rampant inequality still existed and teacher morale was low. Since then  the
Minister's Tirisano programme has  become  the  flagship  for  the  complete
rejuvenation and incitement of improved standards  in  basic  education  and
training.

Even though we like to recognise our successes, there are however  a  number
of concerns that we must indeed address, and we address  these  concerns  in
order to motivate ourselves to still greater heights. We  must  accept  that
even though there have been significant improvements brought  about  by  the
Government's Adult Basic Education and Training Programme,  too  few  moneys
and  resources  have  been  allocated  to   this   fundamentally   important
programme. The delivery of Abet has  therefore  been  relatively  slow.  One
would like to  encourage  the  provinces,  in  particular,  to  devote  more
funding and resources to Abet.

However,  Government  is  not  the  only  institution  that  can   be   held
responsible for Abet. In  this  regard  the  President  has  set  a  shining
example by encouraging communities to volunteer  and  participate  in  local
activities which make a positive difference to the lives of the  people.  As
far as Abet is concerned, there is certainly a lot that  the  community  can
do to enhance this programme.

It has also become clear that  the  capacity-building  of  school  governing
bodies, which the South African Schools Act referred to, is not  effectively
applied. Many school governing  bodies  are  functioning  incoherently,  and
many structures have to be dissolved owing to uneven  participation  by  the
members. It is therefore of  the  utmost  importance  that  we  empower  and
capacitate the school governing bodies to do the  important  work  they  are
required to perform.

In  closing,  the  incidents  of  sexual  harassment  which  girl   children
especially  are  being  subjected  to  at  school  by  male   teachers,   in
particular, is obviously a source of serious concern to all of us.  We  have
noted the assurance by the Minister that the figures  of  sexual  harassment
in our schools, which were released recently,  are  not  necessarily  higher
than those in other countries generally.

However, it remains one of our priorities to ensure  a  safe  and  conducive
environment for all our children in schools where  they  can  continue  with
their tuition unmolested and unharassed. This year, 2002,  is  the  year  of
the volunteer for reconstruction and development. Let us  make  our  schools
work by creating a culture of community service and  development  throughout
the country. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Before  I  recognise  the
Minister, I think I would like to make the observation  that  he  holds  the
record of concluding two separate debates in two different  Houses,  all  in
the space of 30 minutes. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, members of the  House,  I  think  it
would be wonderful if we  had  bifurcation  applying  in  our  lives  -  our
capacity to be in two places at one time. But, unfortunately we have to  put
up with the fact that I had to run all the way from the other  House  which,
in fact, is not, a good thing to do at my age. [Interjections.]

The National Council of  Provinces  fixed  this  date  before  Christmas  to
discuss sexual abuse and harassment in schools. In fact, this is one of  the
most stimulating debates I have had in either of the Houses,  because  there
is a deep commitment and a great deal of research has been done too.

However, I do not want to be  misunderstood.  I  said,  in  fact,  that  the
standards that we require in this country are not  determined  by  comparing
ourselves with other countries. It is our standards that we  want;  what  is
necessary for ourselves in our country. Although, in fact, the rape  figures
for schoolchildren are comparable, as the Lancet report says,  to  those  of
the the United States, it is not my intention to say that we are in a  state
of hunky-doriness. This has been a very good debate, and I hope  this  House
will have a debate on this too.

I see, of course, the topic was ``Towards a sound basis for  human  resource
development through quality basic education''. But  I  see  that  the  House
branched out considerably to discuss the state of education as  a  whole.  I
think that is a very good development really, particularly since  the  topic
was slightly orotund, if not obscure, I should say. That is  why,  I  think,
everyone went on their own escapades.

Let me say first of all that yesterday  we  met  the  Council  of  Education
Ministers. They are in keeping with the higher status of  education.  We  do
not have a Minmec. We do not have MECs meeting a Minister, but we  have  the
Council of Education Ministers. Yesterday on  review  of  the  matriculation
results, with a review of the start to the  school  year,  the  delivery  of
learning materials, and allowing  for  a  slight  degree  of  optimism  that
usually generates when one has reports being made, it was quite clear  that,
in fact, the MECs in the  provinces  were  beginning  to  grapple  with  the
education system. Since the issue was raised by Dr Geldenhuys about  general
education, we spend  a  fair  degree  of  time  looking  at  what  has  been
happening in the schools the last year and how, in fact, the provinces  have
been able to deal with their normal expectations, particularly in  terms  of
removing the really awful legacy of the physical infrastructure of schools.
We also brought to the President's statement that there must be delivery  in
terms of  spending  the  money  the  central  Government  allocates  to  the
provinces. One must remember that education has a  R51  billion  budget  and
that the provinces get about R45/R46 billion of that, with R7 billion  going
to higher education. This puts us on par with the top 25 to 30 countries  in
the world. So, in fact, the command over resources is a  provincial  matter.
And, unless they are able to deliver, there would not be the changes.

So we are very pleased, as the President has said, that within the next  two
financial years nobody should study under trees. My  own  interpretation  of
that is that no one should study under  dangerous  circumstances.  The  only
way we can get on our feet is through an accelerated programme.

I am now convinced that the provinces are,  in  fact,  turning  the  corner.
They are. There is a greater degree of earnestness and a greater  degree  of
seriousness, but they are still  not  all  appointing  chief  executives  as
quickly as they should be. There are serious gaps in appointing  the  senior
staff, but one cannot have gaps and expect to do the work  one  is  supposed
to be doing. So quality in terms of education is going to be discussed.
The initiative in mathematics and science is also  a  very  important  human
resource development, because  universities  depend  on  maths  and  science
performance, particularly since the majority of  black  students  study  the
humanities.  It  is  important  to  get  them  back  into  the  science  and
technology areas.

We have chosen 102 nodal schools in  South  Africa,  and  each  school  will
prepare 100 pupils to do mathematics on the higher grade.  That  immediately
leads them to thousands more doing maths on the higher grade and there  will
be special interventions to get them to  that  higher  grade  level.  So  10
pupils from each school gives one at least 1000 pupils,  which  will  double
this.

I think it is very important that this is incremental. It shows a degree  of
commitment on the part of educationists that we must improve  the  standards
there.

In the same way, we  are  evaluating  the  purpose  of  the  standard  grade
examination, not only mathematics and history. What role does  it  play?  Is
it simply one chunk taken out of the higher grade examination, and then  one
has a  standard  grade  examination,  or  is  one  supposed  to  be  testing
something specific about student  needs?  Remember,  one  cannot  do  degree
courses with a standard  grade  pass.  One  can  only  do  certificates  and
diplomas at technikons.

So, we looked at this very seriously,  and  we  are  now  investigating  why
fewer pupils are doing matric compared  to  the  last  two  years.  We  have
hunches, but anecdotal evidence is not good enough  for  this  business.  We
have to look systematically at this and Statistics SA  is  helping  us  look
into this. In the same way, why are there fewer girls doing mathematics  and
science? We are also doing an investigation into that.

Members should please remember that, in some countries, one has  to  pay  to
be flagellated, to be hit with whips. Why do  we  have  to  do  it  free  of
charge in South Africa? South Africa is  not  last  in  the  human  resource
index, as one hon speaker said. By no means  is  it  last.  We  are  in  the
middle, somewhere in between. For  white  South  Africa,  we  are  one  step
behind Spain. Remember that. So, we are  in  the  top  25  for  white  South
Africa. For black South Africa, we are near the Congo, Brazaville. So,  that
is a measure of where we are in the index. We are certainly not last in  the
world. Remember that please - we do not have to flagellate free  of  charge.
There are people who would assist us in this.

In the same way, we are not last in teaching science in the  world.  We  are
not last. That is not true. What we are setting out to do  is  to  combat  a
situation where large numbers of our teachers, because  of  apartheid,  were
undertrained. [Interjections.] Please do not say that I should not blame  it
on apartheid. I am not blaming it on apartheid. I am just stating  a  matter
of fact that, in seven years, one cannot change this. We are now  taking  10
000 teachers into special training courses. It costs us R90 million, and  10
000 are going to get their teacher's certificates or diplomas in  education.
It has taken us five years to organise getting these 10 000 people into  the
system.

The main thing is that they will do  this  in  their  own  time,  because  I
established this rule that 196 days of teaching must take place. Even if  we
have the World Conference on Sustainable Development, there  will  still  be
196 days of teaching in Gauteng. One  cannot  interfere  there.  One  cannot
have union business being done in teaching time.

We  are  now  having  an  enormous  problem,  because  a  local   government
association raised the issue about local  government  councillors.  What  is
going to happen to them? We have taken the tough position that if one  is  a
full-time councillor, one has to resign. They have come back to  us  to  ask
why they cannot get leave of absence. Our view is that if  one  is  a  part-
time councillor,  one  has  to  reconcile  one's  council  work  with  one's
teaching work. That is part of human resource development, frankly,  because
the kids need the teachers,  and  we  do  not  have  the  capacity  to  have
replacement teachers.

Remember, most  South  Africans  who  go  and  work  in  London  are  supply
teachers. They are glorified policemen and  women,  actually,  because  they
teach for one day in one school, and go off  to  another  school  the  next.
They are just monitors, really. I think we should inform  our  constituents,
when they come to us about the great strength of  the  sterling,  that  they
will not get much job pleasure working there.

I come back to this question about physical  infrastructure.  The  Education
Department got R1,5 billion for the three-year cycle. That  is  an  enormous
sum of money to break the back of bad maintenance,  because  maintenance  is
very expensive, and  of  course,  the  infrastructure  of  particularly  the
Eastern Cape  and  elsewhere.  In  KwaZulu-Natal,  they  do  not  need  more
teachers. They need more classrooms in KwaZulu-Natal. So, it is a  political
persuasion to tell the provincial administration that it does not need  more
teachers, but more classrooms. If  there  are  not  enough  classrooms,  the
teachers and children are in fact wasting their time.

We discussed here yesterday the need for some kind of assessment at the  end
of Grade 9 as part of human resource development. We went too  far,  in  the
last 10 years or so, away from the idea of assessment and  examination.  Now
we are going to test, in a pilot study, young children at Grade  3  to  find
out their number literacy, as part of  their  whole  development.  By  2004,
Grade 9 will be a national reorganised examination, as it were. Between  now
and next year, the schools will do that  with  a  common  record  form.  So,
there will be an assessment at the end of Grade 9, which is the end  of  the
compulsory school-going period.

There will be some kind of assessment. What we are concerned about  is  what
value that assessment or certificate will carry with employers. I  think  it
is very important that we should all be involved in this, because  there  is
no point in having a certificate which employers may scoff at.

Also, we discussed the question that, in  2003,  it  will  be  the  year  of
general further education and training. The Further Education  and  Training
Board  has  agreed  that  it  will  further  education  and  training,   but
particularly the reform of technical education. As the House  knows  -  this
is a parallel for other higher education reform  -  there  is  a  successful
completion of that whole  exercise  of  reducing  more  than  160  technical
colleges to 50 technical colleges. Those sites of teaching will close down.

In our view as educationists, more  of  our  kids  should  be  in  technical
colleges than in higher education. The pyramid is inverted  at  present.  We
want to put it right to get three, four or five times as many students  into
technical education, and then also unity between hand  and  brain,  not  the
disjuncture between brainwork and handwork.  This  is  a  malaise  in  South
Africa, that a distinction takes place between the two. We will combine  the
two together as part of the National Qualifications Framework assessment.

Next year will be a very important year in the  whole  change  in  technical
education. Members should  remember  that  Microsoft's  offer  of  software,
which we are now discussing,  will  bring  about  a  change  in  educational
practice  in  South  Africa.  Coupled  with  this  is  the  fact  that   the
Telecommunications Act will now enable us to ensure that every school,  over
a 10-year period, should have connectivity and  should  be  linked  up.  The
Telecommunications Act  now  allows  for  that.  I  can  announce  that  the
Telecommunications Act allows now for the fact that  the  telephone  charges
for using computers will be 50% of that for normal use. That will also  help
the poorer schools.

The fact is that there have been many changes and movements taking place  in
higher education. I think the last  speaker  covered  many  of  the  changes
taking place, but what we have to be aware of is  that  the  traditions  and
the values in the school system have also got to undergo changes. We  cannot
countenance the fact that there is so much sexual abuse in our  schools.  We
have failed. Whatever grand policies; we have have failed. We have become  a
society of instant gratification, of greed, and - to judge from Big  Brother
- lust and very low  standards.  We  have  become  a  society  that  has  no
compassion. The whole notion that drove us in  the  liberation  movement  of
solidarity is now out the window. To avert this extraordinary  injury  where
innocence is destroyed, the value system must  be  one  that  is  consistent
with our democratic order. That is why it is very  important,  when  we  are
dealing with human resource  development,  that  we  should  see  the  close
connection between early childhood education  and  higher  education.  There
cannot be good higher education without, in fact, putting young people  into
that particular arena of love and fun and education.

That is why, in the Other Place, we  discussed  the  whole  issue,  which  I
would like to mention here, of how to combat sexual abuse.  A  programme  of
sexuality education is vital to do that. To instil respect  for  women,  and
to instil respect for the  integrity  of  young  people,  we  have  to  have
sexuality education. I think that is a very vital area  in  the  development
of the resources of our young people.

We should remember the very famous statement made  somewhere:  ``Suffer  the
little children unto me''. I think what we are trying to do  in  our  school
system is to make the school system  congenial  to  young  people,  whatever
inequalities we  have,  and  whatever  inequalities  exist  from  our  past.

Debate concluded.

     Dear Madam Speaker


     RE: APPOINTMENT OF NEW ICASA CONCILLORS


     I would like to bring to your attention that the  terms  of  office  of
     three ICASA Councillors will come to an end on 30th of June 2002.


     The Councillors have been appointed  in  terms  of  Section  5  of  the
     Independent Communications Authority of South  Africa  Act  No.  13  of
     2000. In terms of  the  Act,  the  Councillors  are  appointed  by  the
     President on a recommendation from the National Assembly.


     It is crucial that the appointments  be  dealt  with  as  a  matter  of
     urgency to avoid interruptions in the licensing process of  the  Second
     National Operator, SMME's and the  general  functioning  of  the  ICASA
     Council, etc.


     It will be appreciated if the entire process of the appointment of  new
     Councillors could be completed by the end of April 2002;


     I hope you will find the above in order.
