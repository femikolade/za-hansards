                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I give  notice  that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the political currents flowing in Malawi that run counter to the
           direction Africa should be  going  as  envisaged  in  the  Nepad
           initiative, and by the world democratic community;


       (b)  that President Bakili Muluzi of Malawi is seeking a  third  term
           in office, and that the ruling party is seeking  to  change  the
           constitution accordingly;


       (c)  that these attempts to change the constitution have led to large-
           scale protests in the streets, and to  protest  from  local  and
           international bodies and organisations;


       (d)  that inter alia the  Malawi  Council  of  Churches,  the  Muslim
           community and the Council for Nongovernmental  Organisations  of
           Malawi are in agreement that the  constitutional  change  should
           not occur, and that they have voiced their opposition;
       (e)  that the IMF has failed to disburse any funding  under  Malawi's
           poverty reduction  and  growth  facility  in  2001-2002,  citing
           ``concerns of transparency, corruption  and  good  governance'';
           and


       (f)  further notes that the International Bar Association, the global
           voice of the legal profession, has also voiced its concern about
           and  opposition  to  the  proposed  changes  to  that  country's
           constitution, and that the IBA director, Mark Ellis, said:  ``In
           the face of widespread food shortages and poverty, there is  now
           a danger that the country could lose its  grip  on  democracy'';
           and


  (2) in view of the aforementioned, calls upon our Government to  use  its
       influence in the region and  with  the  government  of  Malawi  along
       diplomatic channels to express its  concern  and  opposition  to  the
       proposed changes.

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Mnr die Voorsitter, by die volgende sitting  van  die  Raad
sal ek voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem -


  (1) dat mnr Marthinus van Schalkwyk eenparig deur die Wes-Kaapse hoofraad
       en  uitvoerende  komitee   van   die   Nuwe   NP   aangewys   is   as
       premierskandidaat van die Wes-Kaap; en


  (2) dat mnr Van Schalkwyk uitstekend toegerus is om  die  amp  te  beklee
       vanweë die feit dat hy -


       (a)  reeds diep spore getrap het in die Suid-Afrikaanse politiek;


       (b)  'n groot rol speel in  die  bemagtiging  van  opposisieparty  in
           Afrika deur sy betrokkenheid by die demokratiese Afrika-unie;


       (c)  oor die vermoë beskik om uiteenlopende standpunte met mekaar  te
           versoen  in  belang  van   goeie   regering   en   doeltreffende
           dienslewering; en


       (d)  besig is om 'n belangrike rol te speel in die  rangskikking  van
           die Suid-Afrikaanse politieke landskap ten einde te voldoen  aan
           die eise van 'n moderne demokrasie.

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Mr Chairperson, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council notes that Mr Marthinus van Schalkwyk -


  (1) has been unanimously elected by the Western Cape head council and the
       executive committee of the New NP as candidate  for  premier  of  the
       Western Cape; and


  (2) is excellently equipped to fill the position owing to the  fact  that
       he -
       (a)  has already made his mark in South African politics;


       (b)  plays a big role in the empowerment of the opposition parties in
           Africa through  his  involvement  with  the  democratic  African
           Union;

           of good governance and efficient service delivery; and

           African political landscape in order to meet the  demands  of  a
           modern indigenous democracy.]

       confrontation between India and Pakistan over the  disputed  area  of
       Kashmir;

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its deep concern over the current deadlock  in  the  Middle
       East peace process;


  (2) expresses further concern over the recent  killing  and  wounding  of
       innocent civilians on both sides;


  (3)  condemns  the  repressive  policies  and  actions  of  the   Israeli
       government, including the economic  suffocation  of  the  Palestinian
       people;


  (4) reiterates its support for the inalienable right of  the  Palestinian
       people to self-determination; and

                         REHABILITATION OF PRISONERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the statement by the Minister  of  Correctional  Services  that
       effective  rehabilitation  depends  on  narrowing  the  wealth   gap,
       eradicating violence as a lifestyle of  choice  and  changing  socio-
       economic conditions;


  (2)  further  notes  that  the  Minister  is  committed  to  placing  the
       rehabilitation of prisoners at the core of his activities so  that  a
       balance is struck between rehabilitation and safe custody;


  (3) believes that the shift from a punitive approach to  one  focused  on
       rehabilitation poses major challenges;


  (4) also believes that the Minister and his  department  are  capable  of
       dealing with these new challenges; and


  (5) therefore commends the Minister for working hard to improve the lives
       of prisoners.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  EVIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS SEIZED FROM HARKSENS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the documents seized by police from Mr Harksen and his wife, and
           which were handed to the Desai commission on Thursday, include a
           printout of Mr Harksen's cellphone  bill  which  shows  that  in
           January this year he was contacting Mr Morkel up to five times a
           day;


       (b)  among the documents is a copy of the full lawyer's  account  for
           Mr Morkel's court case against the New NP in November last year,
           and that the commission's leader  of  evidence,  Craig  Webster,
           told the commission that it was found in an envelope  under  the
           sink in Jeanette Harksen's boutique in central Cape Town;


       (c)  Mr Harksen has told the Desai commission he paid almost half  of
           the bill, which totalled over R229 000;


       (d)  Mr Morkel has consistently denied receiving any  donations  from
           Harksen;


       (e)  the documents also include an  invoice  form  Seeff  residential
           letting for the rent on the Higgovale home that Morkel lived  in
           after he was ousted as Western Cape Premier last year; and


  (2) calls on Morkel immediately to resign as mayor of Cape Town.

       commitment to the plight of unskilled people in our  country  through

             WARNING ISSUED BY MICRO FINANCE REGULATORY COUNCIL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the newspaper reports that the Micro Finance Regulatory Council
       has warned people not to sign  any  blank  documents  when  borrowing
       money;


  (2) further notes that some borrowers  have  complained  of  money  being
       deducted from their salaries in terms of garnishee orders obtained by
       micro lenders;

       numerous  investigations  and  has  brought  44   cases   before   an
       independent disciplinary committee; and


  (4) therefore calls upon the  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional
       Development to play his part in curbing the abuses and  to  encourage
       the officials of the court to peruse any such documents they receive.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      CONGRATULATIONS TO BAFANA BAFANA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates Bafana Bafana  on  its  imperious  performance  in  its
       opening fixture against Paraguay at the World Cup  on  1  June  2002,
       when Dr Quentin Fortune gave the kiss of life  to  a  seemingly  dead
       situation;


  (2) further hopes that now that an insatiable appetite for  soccer  glory
       has been awakened, the second fixture against Slovenia on Saturday, 8
       June 2002 will also result in a score that will bring  further  pride
       and glory, not only to South Africa, but to Africa as well.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a point  of  order:  Although  we  agree
with the motion, this motion has been put to the  House  previously  and  we
cannot vote on it again. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: There is no formal  objection  to  the
motion. The motion is agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, with  respect,  perhaps  you  do
not understand the nature of the intervention by my colleague.

A similar motion was passed either yesterday  or  the  day  before  in  this
Council. The motion complimented and congratulated South  Africa,  and  also
the other African sides that have done so well, and wished them well in  the
future games.

Whilst we agree with the contents of the motion, it is  not  permissible  in
terms of our Rules, as a similar  motion  has  been  passed  in  this  House
earlier.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you,  Chief  Whip,  for  that
explanation. So, hon Raju, you will understand that  the  motion  cannot  be
allowed.

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON THE AFRICAN UNION

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Chairperson, I will  be  brief.  I  am  very
pleased that the NCOP working group has arrived at  a  point  where  we  are
able to present a report to the NCOP on the assignment that  we  were  given
by the  Council  to  examine  the  various  protocols  associated  with  the
establishment of the  African  Union  and  the  Pan-African  Parliament  and
associated institutions related to these two bodies.

We have taken the very direct decision as the  Parliament  of  South  Africa
that we  will  ensure  that  we  play  a  role  in  the  unfolding  positive
developments on our continent. We have taken  a  stand  which  asserts  that
parliaments have to play an international role in society. For far too  long
we have had a situation in which our parliaments have allowed the  executive
essentially  to  lead  international  matters  and  all  relationships  that
countries have  with  institutions  at  the  international  level  and  with
foreign nations.

As this Parliament, we have led the way in ensuring that we do play  a  role
in giving  consideration  to  international  instruments,  to  international
developments and to strengthening relationships with  countries  across  the
world. Our working group report indicates a fairly careful scrutiny  of  the
protocol, now an Act, leading to the establishment of the African Union  and
leading, we hope, following the launch in July of the African Union  in  our
country, to the establishment of  the  various  bodies  emanating  from  the
Constitutive Act of the African Union.

We have also given scrutiny to the Pan-African Parliament protocol. We  hope
that our Government will soon be tabling it in Parliament  so  that  we  may
consider the protocol and ratify the instrument, in order to ensure that  we
proceed to act on these very  instruments  that  Africans  have  decided  to
adopt.

Our continent has said it is moving on a new  path,  a  path  of  democracy,
good governance and development. The scrutiny that we  have  made  of  these
instruments indicates that indeed they have the framework  that  will  allow
our continent to move forward in a positive way. A great deal of work  needs
to be done in order to ensure that at a practical level  we  indeed  achieve
the ideals that are elaborated in the Acts we are going to decide upon in  a
few moments.

We are fortunate that we work and live in a country committed to  democracy,
that we have a Parliament that is democratic and open, that bases itself  on
universal principles of openness and transparency. We now have an  important
role to play in ensuring that in giving life to the Constitutive Act of  the
African Union and eventually to the Pan African protocol we also  work  with
parliaments on the continent to ensure that in each country they  enjoy  the
principles and levels of democracy that we ourselves hold  to  and  practice
in South Africa. This is an important assignment that we have been given.

I commend the report to the Council and I hope hon members will support  the
report and the various recommendations we have made within it and  that,  in
particular, they will agree that we now begin to work in a  joint  formation
with the National Assembly working group so that Parliament  will  formulate
a set  of  recommendations,  which  could  then  be  taken  forward  to  our
Government as they proceed to the launch of the African Union in July.

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.
          RESOLUTION OF THE NCOP WORKING GROUP ON THE AFRICAN UNION

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I think it is  just  appropriate
that this Council  recognises  the  contribution  and  the  efforts  by  the
Chairperson of the NCOP in relation to the work that has  been  done  around
the African Union in respect  of  the  preparation  and  the  engagement  of
members in this important activity. It has also been suggested that we  will
in fact carry this activity out  to  the  nine  provincial  legislatures  in
order to develop sufficient and adequate awareness of  this  very  important
programme.

I would like to express on behalf of the Council our gratitude  to  the  hon
Chairperson and the presiding officers of the National  Assembly  for  their
active engagement with this important and critical area of development.

I move:
  That the Council, subject to the concurrence of  the  National  Assembly,
  resolves that the National Council of  Provinces  Working  Group  on  the
  African Union confer with the National  Assembly  Working  Group  on  the
  African Union.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       PRECEDENCE TO ORDER OF THE DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF  WHIP  OF  THE  COUNCIL:  Mr  Chairperson,  before  the  Secretary
proceeds to read the next order of the day, I move without notice:


  That the Council, subject to the concurrence of  the  National  Assembly,
  resolves that the National Council of  Provinces  Working  Group  on  the
  African Union confer with the National  Assembly  Working  Group  on  the
  African Union.

I have conferred with most of the representatives  of  the  other  political
parties and they had no objection.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 MEDIA DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSITY AGENCY BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Mr  Chairperson,  may  I  also  add  my  own
appreciation to the Chairperson of the NCOP for all the  work  she  and  the
other presiding officers have done in regard to an African Parliament.

It is a great pleasure and honour  to  introduce  this  legislation  to  the
NCOP. It paves the way  towards  making  a  living  reality  for  all  South
Africans of their right to freedom of information and expression.

Indeed, the Media Development and Diversity  Agency  Bill  now  before  this
House gives expression to a major South African achievement.  It  represents
the building of an unprecedented partnership  that  will  allow  Government,
the media industry and donors to work together  to  redress  the  legacy  of
imbalances in access to the media.

It represents an  important  step  towards  the  fulfilment  of  the  pledge
enshrined in our Constitution, that all  citizens  shall  enjoy  freedom  of
expression, including freedom of the media and freedom to receive or  impart
information and ideas.

The Bill provides effective means for  implementing  the  recommendation  of
Comtask in 1996, adopted by Government, that Government should  ``facilitate
the process of setting up a statutorily recognised media development  agency
... will operate a statutorily recognised subsidy system for  community  and
independent media in South Africa''.

The journey from Comtask in 1996 to the NCOP  in  2002  has  been  long  and
complex. But if it has evoked some impatience and frustration amongst  those
eager to benefit from support for media development, it  has  been  thorough
in seeking consensus in a complex sector of our society.

Conferences, consultations, research and public hearings, not  to  speak  of
debate in the media,  have  left  the  imprint  of  wide-ranging  views  and
opinions on this piece of legislation. We believe that  the  work  has  been
done to allow the NCOP to put the final  parliamentary  seal  on  the  Media
Development and Diversity Agency Bill.

Generations of oppression and domination have left  our  emerging  democracy
with a skewed information and media landscape. While some progress has  been
made in changing the media industry since the achievement of  democracy,  it
is only a very small beginning compared to what is needed.

We are constantly reminded of the enduring legacy. Recently,  Statistics  SA
published results of a survey of  conditions  in  the  nodal  areas  of  the
Integrated Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme.  Nine  million  South
Africans live in these areas, including the  bulk  of  the  poorest  of  the
poor.

Amongst other things, the survey  found  that  in  these  areas  only  three
quarters of households had a radio and only one third had a television  set.
Other surveys tell us that in such areas newspapers are read  by  less  than
20% of the people. None of us would want such a  situation  to  persist.  We
must find ways that assist in  the  dismantling  of  the  many  barriers  to
participation in the media as consumers, as writers and as managers.

Transformation must touch every major institution and sector of our  society
if we are to make a reality of our vision of  a  fully  democratic  society;
and that includes the media. The recognition that it is in the interests  of
democracy that we should all work together to address the imbalances of  the
past, informs the broad support for  the  Media  Development  and  Diversity
Agency that has been built.

A driving force in the  process  towards  an  MDDA  is  the  principle  that
Government, private media and international donors should  jointly  mobilise
resources for media development  and  diversity.  There  have  been  debates
about how to do this. A proposal for a compulsory levy  on  advertising  has
given way to  a  voluntary  approach,  but,  throughout,  the  principle  of
partnership has guided the process, and  it  is  firmly  entrenched  in  the
legislation.

The media industry has committed itself to supporting the work of the  MDDA.
We are preparing to approach donor agencies for their support  now  that  it
has been  clearly  demonstrated  that  South  Africans  are  going  to  work
together in a sustained way to promote media development and diversity.

We should note that while this is a partnership, Government is  putting  the
bulk of the money into the agency. At the  same  time,  the  private  sector
contribution has great significance. There are also few, if  any,  countries
in which the commercial media sector has joined  hands  with  government  to
give material support to a statutory agency.

I must therefore once again express our appreciation of  the  commitment  to
media development and diversity on the part of the media  houses.  We  thank
them for the way they have engaged with  us  in  working  towards  positions
which, if they have not brought complete agreement, are ones with which  all
of us, I believe, can feel comfortable.

Commitments  to  date  from  Government  and  industry,  which  are  to   be
formalised once the agency is in existence, amount to just over R40  million
per annum. There will be further material support such as  training,  access
to print and distribution facilities or subsidies  and  discounts  that  the
MDDA will be seeking  for  developing  small  media.  We  believe  that  the
process towards the transformation in the advertising industry will  produce
creative ways of helping small  media  meet  the  challenges  posed  by  the
economic imperatives of advertising.

The  composition  of  the  board  likewise   reflects   the   principle   of
partnership. Six members will be publicly nominated and appointed through  a
parliamentary process. Three other members will  be  directly  appointed  by
the President, taking into account the funding of the agency and  this  will
include one from the commercial print media  and  one  from  the  commercial
broadcast media sector.

It  is  essential  that  an  agency  concerned  with  the  media  should  be
independent and at arm's length from Government, from  its  funders  in  the
media industry and from any other donors. The Bill  therefore  requires  the
agency to be  demonstrably  independent.  It  requires  its  members  to  be
impartial and to act ``without fear, favour or prejudice,  and  without  any
political or commercial interference.''

The strong provision dealing with conflict  of  interest,  modelled  on  the
Icasa Act, is there to ensure that funds are not disbursed  to  further  the
interests of any member of the board. Other  principles  of  good  corporate
governance are written into the legislation. This includes  transparency  in
the MDDA's operations.

Further, the agency  is  subject  to  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,
audited by the Auditor-General, and must report to  Parliament  every  year.
The guidelines it follows in providing support must be set out  for  all  to
see in the form of regulations. In this regard, let me stress that  in  this
matter also the principle of partnership applies. These  guidelines  require
the agreement  of  both  the  board  and  the  Minister  in  the  making  of
regulations; neither can make them on their own.

The Bill expressly prohibits the MDDA  from  interfering  in  the  editorial
content of the media. Its focus, rather, is on addressing and  reducing  the
barriers to participation in the  media  that  have  stood  in  the  way  of
previously  disadvantaged  sections  of  our  society.  Support  for   media
development will, we are  convinced,  create  conditions  favouring  greater
diversity.

That support will include direct cash grants to  community  media  projects,
capacity-building as well as training in all areas of media  production  and
distribution. In the case  of  small  commercial  media,  the  main  support
envisaged is the facilitation of favourable loans, including  assistance  in
developing viable business plans and capacity-building.

In  the  case  of  community  media  this  may  involve  negotiations   with
advertisers and marketers to explore new ways of generating income  for  new
operations as well as to ensure their longer-term survival.

In the case of small commercial media, the MDDA  is  empowered  to  interact
with  financial  institutions  and  small  business  support  programmes  to
facilitate access to loans on more favourable conditions.  That  would  help
utilise funding programmes that currently exist even  where  they  were  not
explicitly created to deal with media needs.

The MDDA will liaise with organisations such  as  Icasa  and  the  Universal
Service Agency so that the activities of  the  different  bodies  complement
one another. By supplementing and drawing together  within  a  comprehensive
framework many threads of support for media development and  diversity,  the
MDDA will provide a powerful impetus to the development of  community  media
and small commercial media amongst  historically  disadvantaged  sectors  of
our society. Its impact will, we have no  doubt,  be  felt  far  beyond  the
small media sector.

In the course of the public hearings and discussion around this  initiative,
we heard eloquent expression of the hunger  amongst  our  people  for  media
that reflect their own lives in their own communities.  Research  points  to
their wish for more information of a kind  that  they  can  use  to  improve
their lives.

By helping to meet those information needs, community media will promote  an
interest in the media generally. Those who start with  media  that  empowers
them in their immediate circumstances will move  naturally  to  other  media
products. Promoting a culture of reading will be  of  benefit  also  to  the
established media.

When the MDDA facilitates training and capacity-building in the small  media
sector it will be felt, as it always has been, far beyond this sector.  Many
of those who today are beginning to change the character of our large  media
houses cut their teeth in the community media sector.

In most cases the newspapers that nurtured those  communication  skills  and
creativity, the media which  opened  a  window  to  public  information  and
discourse, have disappeared. The MDDA will help create the conditions for  a
vigorous and expanding small-media sector that will work to the  benefit  of
the country's entire media sector. It will strengthen the hands of  citizens
as informed and active agents in the reconstruction  of  their  country  and
the development of a just and prosperous society.

I would like to thank the Select committee on Labour and Public  Enterprises
and its chairperson for the attention they gave  to  this  Bill,  which  has
enabled it to come before this Council today. This is a momentous  occasion,
marking the final stages of a policy  development  and  legislative  process
that has been unique in many ways. Participation and partnership  have  been
our  watchwords  as  the  country  embarked  on  a  course  through  largely
uncharted territory.

It would have been possible to take another route, and for Government to  go
it alone and simply  set  up  a  media  development  and  diversity  agency.
Instead we have introduced legislation to create an agency at  arm's  length
from Government and based on a partnership. That, we believe,  is  the  path
that will do the most to foster more diversified media in South Africa.

Though the passing of this Bill will complete the parliamentary process,  it
will also open the way to the challenges of implementation and  development.
Practical steps towards establishing  the  agency  must  begin  in  earnest.
Those who have been marginalised from  the  media  will  be  planning  their
applications. Agreements and commitments must be formalised  and  finalised.
A board must come into existence and staff be appointed so  that  funds  can
be disbursed.

In short,  all  the  possibilities  created  by  this  legislation  must  be
realised so that more of  our  citizens  enjoy  the  rights  of  freedom  of
expression and information. I have great pleasure in  commending  this  Bill
to the NCOP. [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, allow  me  to  start
by reading a quote from the Triple Inquiry report of the IBA of 1995:


  Access to information is central to any democracy, as a country can  only
  be regarded as truly democratic when its citizens have a  say  that  goes
  beyond the vote at national and local level.

This  quote  stresses  the  importance  of  access  to  information  in  any
democracy. It implies the importance of a people of a country having  access
to the media, freedom of expression through the media, and diversity in  the
media.

As we all  know,  information  is  power.  It  is  growth.  It  casts  aside
ignorance. It is the reason that we had our first African going into  space.
Hence today we are a very proud  nation.  It  represents  opportunities.  We
live in a world that is driven by  information.  A  nation  that  reads  has
access to information and is a winning nation.

This Bill seeks to achieve that kind of democracy, a democracy  in  which  a
broader South African population  has  access  to  information,  information
that reaches even the remote areas, thus creating a public that can  express
itself freely through the media. It seeks  to  promote  diversity  in  media
that know no race, sex or age. Access to the media is a right for all  South
Africans. The end result would be to  create  a  winning  nation  for  South
Africa.

Furthermore, it is based on the need to address the legacy of imbalances  in
access to and use of the media. As we all know, in the past the majority  of
our people were denied this right. They were denied  access  to  information
and the media. This right was reserved for a minority.

Our people were denied a right to express their  views  freely  through  the
media. This was compounded by high levels of  illiteracy,  underdevelopment,
particularly in the rural areas, and little or no infrastructure. These  are
still visible realities. These realities  include  a  concentration  of  the
media in metropolitan areas, the low density  of  media  infrastructure  and
the  restriction  of  access  to  distribution  for  community   and   small
commercial media enterprises. A legacy in media organisations of  inadequate
education, training and  advancement  of  disadvantaged  South  Africans  is
clearly visible.

Today, through our support for this Bill, we as  the  committee  are  saying
that these realities should become a thing of the past and  that  this  Bill
is indeed about translating the aspirations of freedom  of  expression  into
reality. It is an expression of our conviction  that  we  must  address  the
legacies of the past.

It is our belief that the ideals contained in this  Bill  can  only  succeed
and  be  achieved  if  funded  by  a  partnership  of  Government  and   the
stakeholders.  It  is  very  important  as  it  confirms  the   Government's
commitment to working together  with  various  stakeholders  for  what  best
serves the nation.

The Bill provides for the establishment of an independent agency that  will,
through support, facilitation and  research,  help  to  create  an  enabling
environment for media development and diversity in  South  Africa.  That  is
important for our democracy.

This agency is necessary for our democracy for it will play a  key  role  in
bringing about change in the media. We are confident that it  will  help  to
improve the communication environment in a way that  builds  infrastructure.
We believe that it will foster the emergence of media that  give  expression
to voices that are currently marginalised.

It will allow the media to develop  to  meet  the  diverse  needs  of  South
Africans. Our country is in transition, so  I  am  sure  that  members  will
agree with me when I say that this agency will play a very crucial  role  in
our democracy, in particular the transformation of the media sector.

It is our firm belief that this independent body will be  a  key  player  in
overcoming the barriers to media development like  the  lack  of  access  to
resources, training, education and literacy. By overcoming such barriers  to
the media, the MDDA will  promote  a  climate  conducive  to  greater  media
diversity.

Some of the primary  functions  that  are  proposed  include  providing  and
facilitating funding and other support mechanisms and training and capacity-
building  for  community  media  that  serve  the   interests   of   various
marginalised communities. It will also support small  commercial  media  and
fund research that is relevant to media development and diversity.

This Bill is directly based on our constitutional  rights  that  ensure  the
freedom of our press  and  media  and  our  freedom  to  receive  or  impart
information  or  ideas.  It  affirms  our  people's  right  to  freedom   of
expression.

I would like to conclude by congratulating the department on the  role  that
they have played in this Bill, being aware of the fact  that  it  must  have
been a very challenging task. On behalf of my committee I would like to  say
once again that we support this Bill. A better life for all demands that  we
must have access to media. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Mnr die  Voorsitter,  die  wetsontwerp  het  ten  doel  om  'n
agentskap vir media-ontwikkeling daar te stel, wat deur 'n raad  beheer  sal
word. Klousule 3 handel met die doelstellings van die agentskap,  wat  onder
meer die bevordering van die vryheid van die pers en ander media  aanspreek.
Die agentskap sal hom ook  beywer  om  die  verskeidenheid  van  menings  en
stemme in die media te bevorder. Die  agentskap  sal  ook  toesien  dat  die
konstitusionele reg van vryheid van spraak deur alle Suid-Afrikaners  geniet
sal word. Ook die voorheen benadeelde taal- en kultuurgroepe in  Suid-Afrika
wie se toegang tot en die gebruik van die media beperk was.

Dit is bevorderlik vir gesonde debat wat die lewe  van  almal  raak  en  dit
bevorder  ook  'n  beter  begrip  vir  'n  samelewing  wat  dikwels  nog  in
kompartemente lewe. Dat daar nog ongelykhede en wanbalanse in die  industrie
bestaan, is ongetwyfeld so, asook steeds  hindernisse  wat  verhoed  dat  'n
sekere deel van die gemeenskap toegang tot sekere hulpmiddele het. Deur  die
verwydering van hierdie hindernisse kan die agentskap 'n  klimaat  skep  vir
groter media diversiteit. Meer kompetisie gaan daartoe bydra dat  die  media
wat tans funksioneer, beter diens aan die gemeenskap kan lewer.

Dit is waar dat daar geen noemenswaardige groei oor die  afgelope  agt  jaar
ten opsigte van media diversiteit was  nie.  'n  Mens  sou  verwag  dat  die
industrie meer doen om meer mense uit die voorheen  benadeelde  gemeenskappe
te betrek by die bedryf. Ongelukkig het dit nie na wense gebeur nie  en  was
die Regering verplig deur die Grondwet om met wetgewing te kom  om  dit  aan
te spreek.

In 'n jong ontwikkelende demokrasie soos Suid-Afrika kan 'n mens nie  anders
as om enige stap wat die verskeidenheid van menings en stemme in  die  media
bevorder, te verwelkom nie. Die Nuwe NP bevraagteken egter die feit dat  die
wetsontwerp voorsiening maak dat sekere media deur 'n  agentskap  finansieel
gehelp kan word deur of direkte subsidie of  lae  rentekoerse.  Dit  beteken
dat die gevaar kan ontstaan dat die media sy  onafhanklikheid  kan  verloor,
as gevolg van 'n finansiële afhanklikheid van die staat, wat dit  vir  hulle
onmoontlik sal maak om hul waghondfunksie te vervul. Die direkte  finansiële
steun moet liewer gehanteer word deur 'n onafhanklike liggaam op  'n  streng
besigheidsbasis, ná voorlegging van besigheidsplanne.

Die feit dat die samestelling van die raad en die mag by  die  politici  lê,
is werklik nie bevorderlik vir persvryheid nie. Die Nuwe NP wil  nie  beweer
dat dit wel sal gebeur nie, en wys nie 'n vinger  na  die  huidige  Minister
nie. Die wetsontwerp, soos dit  staan,  maak  dit  volgens  ons  mening  wel
moontlik vir die staat om in te meng in die  funksionering  van  die  media,
wat 'n absolute onafhanklike been van die demokrasie moet bly. Laat ons  nie
die foute van die verlede herhaal nie. Om  hierdie  rede  kan  die  Nuwe  NP
ongelukkig  nie  hierdie  wetsontwerp  soos  dit  nou  staan,   steun   nie.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P J C Nel: Mr Chairperson, this Bill aims to  establish  an  agency  for
media development, which will be governed by a board. Section 3  deals  with
the objectives of the agency, which, inter alia, address  the  promotion  of
freedom of the press and other media. This agency  will  also  endeavour  to
promote the diversity of opinions and voices in the media. The  agency  will
also see to it that  the  constitutional  right  to  freedom  of  speech  is
enjoyed by all South Africans. Also, the previously  disadvantaged  language
and cultural groups in South Africa whose access to and  use  of  the  media
were limited, will be addressed.

This is conducive to lively debate which will touch the  lives  of  all  and
this will also promote a better understanding in a  society  that  is  often
still  compartmentalised.  That  there   still   exists   inequalities   and
imbalances in the industry is undoubtedly so,  as  well  as  fact  that  the
obstacles prevent a certain portion  of  the  community  access  to  certain
resources. With the removal of these  obstacles  the  agency  can  create  a
climate for greater media diversity.  More  competition  will  lead  to  the
media, as it  is  currently  functioning,  contributing  to  better  service
delivery to the community.

It is true that there has been no significant growth  over  the  past  eight
years with regard to media diversity. One would  expect  that  the  industry
would have done more to involve people  from  the  previously  disadvantaged
communities  in  this  industry.  Unfortunately,   this   did   not   happen
sufficiently and the Government was forced to  produce  legislation  through
the Constitution in order to address this.

In a young developing democracy such as South Africa  one  cannot  help  but
welcome any step which promotes the diversity and  opinions  and  voices  in
the media. The New NP, however, questions the  fact  that  this  Bill  makes
provision for certain media to be financially assisted by an agency  through
direct subsidies or low interest rates. This implies that there is a  danger
that  the  media's  independence  could  be  lost  because  of  a  financial
dependency on the state which will make it impossible  for  them  to  fulfil
their watchdog  function.  The  direct  financial  support  must  rather  be
handled  by  an  independent  body  on  a  strict  business   basis,   after
presentation of business plans.

That the composition of the board and their powers  are  residing  with  the
politicians is really not desirable for freedom of the  press.  The  New  NP
would not like to allege that  this  will  indeed  happen,  and  it  is  not
pointing a finger at the current Minister. The Bill, as it  stands,  in  our
opinion, makes it very well possible for  the  state  to  intervene  in  the
functioning of the media, which must remain an absolutely  independent  part
of the democracy. Let us  not  repeat  mistakes  from  the  past.  For  this
reason, the New NP can unfortunately not support this  Bill  as  it  stands.
[Applause.]]

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, the aim of the  Media
Development and  Diversity  Agency  Bill  is  to  help  create  an  enabling
environment for media development and diversity that  is  conducive  to  the
diverse public of South Africa. It is a channel  of  development  that  will
reflect  the  needs  and  aspirations  of  marginalised  and   disadvantaged
communities to have access to the media and the media industry.

The Bill seeks to fulfil  this  task  by  promoting  media  development  and
diversity by  providing  support,  primarily  to  the  community  and  small
commercial media projects, in an equitable representation within  the  media
in general. This Bill proposes the establishment of  the  media  development
and diversity agency as well as the media development and  diversity  agency
board to oversee the functions of the agency.

One of the challenges this Bill seeks to address is the media's  failure  to
adequately use and promote  indigenous  languages  and  the  restriction  of
access to distribution of community and small commercial media enterprises.

The Media  Development  and  Diversity  Agency's  role  in  facilitating  an
enabling environment is to contribute  to  media  development  by  providing
support to community media and,  secondly,  to  small  commercial  media  by
providing direct financial support to community media projects.

This Bill will be instrumental in contributing to further media  development
and diversity to marginalised communities in that  it  proposes  to  address
the obstacles  to  development  and  diversity.  Those  obstacles  are:  the
concentration of media in metropolitan  areas;  the  low  density  of  media
infrastructure; the restriction of access to distribution for community  and
small commercial enterprises; the lack of resources to  support  the  growth
of  community  and  small  commercial  enterprises;  the  legacy  in   media
organisations of inadequate education, training  and  advancement  of  black
South  Africans;  the  need  to  encourage   framework   and   environmental
conditions conducive to the promotion  of  development-orientated  news  and
information; and the challenges posed by rapid  development  of  new  media,
including the need for new skills and greater telecommunications access.

The objective of the agency is to promote development and diversity  in  the
South African media throughout the country, consistent  with  the  right  to
freedom of expression as entrenched in section 16(1) of  the  South  African
Constitution, in particular to freedom of the press,  in  order  to  receive
and impart information or ideas so as to encourage ownership and control  of
and  access  to  media  by  historically   disadvantaged   communities   and
historically diminished indigenous language and cultural groups.

The agency will also  encourage  the  development  of  human  resources  and
training  and  capacity-building  within  the  media  industry,   especially
amongst historically disadvantaged groups,  which  will  channel  and  raise
public awareness with regard to media development, and promote literacy  and
a culture of reading.

This Bill also proposes the creation of a media  development  and  diversity
agency board. The role of this board will be to  promote  media  development
and diversity by  identifying  historically  disadvantaged  communities  and
persons that are not adequately served by the media.

The board  will  also  select  projects  in  accordance  with  the  criteria
prescribed in terms of clause 19(3), which  provides  that  the  board  must
prescribe detailed criteria for selecting community  media  projects,  small
commercial media projects and research projects.

Lastly,  the  board  has  the  power  to  negotiate  with   public   utility
organisations and financial institutions to  acquire  indirect  support  for
projects, including support in the form of discounts or subsidies  in  print
and signal distribution, postal rates, telephone tariffs and  low  interest-
rate loans. [Applause]

Mr K D S DURR: Dankie, mnr die Voorsitter, dat u my aan die woord stel.  Dit
is goed om die agb lid mnr Van Niekerk in die Stoel te sien. [Thank you,  Mr
Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to speak. It is good to see the  hon
member Mr Van Niekerk in the Chair.]

We have three estates - the Government, the judiciary and the legislature  -
and  the  media  is  often  referred  to  as  the   fourth   estate.   Their
constitutional position is the same as that which  governs  the  freedom  of
speech  of  the  individual.  One  suspects  that  if  the  framers  of  our
Constitution had felt the need for something like this Bill or  this  board,
they  might  have  included  it  in  Chapter  9,  Section  181(1)   of   the
Constitution, along with the other bodies  that  were  established  at  that
time with laudable objectives, which are functioning. But they  rested  with
the freedom of  expression  clause  in  Chapter  2,  section  16(1)  of  the
Constitution, as set out in the Bill.

This Bill puts us in a difficult position, because the expressed  intentions
of the Bill - there is no question - are laudable, but how to achieve  those
laudable goals is something else, and that is what puts us in  a  bit  of  a
quandary. The big problem, of course, is that he who pays  the  piper  calls
the tune. There is a balance between the Government and the media -  between
the size and sheer scale of Government and that of  the  media  -  and  this
somehow skews the balance. It somehow creates imbalances in that  it  gives,
or could give, the state leverage over  the  media,  which,  by  definition,
means a diminution of the media's role.

I have to add that much is said about donations by the  media  industry,  or
promises of  large-scale  donations  running  into  millions,  to  meet  the
objects of this Bill. If that is  not  tax  deductible,  then  that  amounts
basically to an additional tax upon the media which, by definition,  weakens
it and does not strengthen it.

I know it is not the intention of this Bill,  but  the  Minister  will  know
that governments are not very good at running the media or even  influencing
it. There is always a tension between government and  the  media,  and  that
tension is not a bad thing. It is sometimes awkward for government,  but  it
is not a bad thing, in that it is the  tension  that  often  exists  between
these two estates that serves the purposes of  democracy.  Therefore  it  is
good that there should be a Chinese wall between the state and the media.

There are things the Government can do, of course. Better  literacy  levels,
education and higher standards of living will create media  needs,  and  the
media will respond to those dynamic influences in  society.  There  are,  of
course, many existing funds, the IDC and others,  that  can  help  with  the
other objectives of the Bill that are expressed. So it is not  as  if  there
is no machinery  or  apparatus  available  to  meet  many  of  the  laudable
objectives which the Bill sets out.

Perhaps the state can help to finance the private sector and  also  help  to
...

The TEMPORARY CHAIRPERSON (Mr A E van Niekerk):  Hon  Durr,  your  time  has
expired.

Mr K D S DURR: It is with regret that we oppose the Bill.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, this Bill proposes to set  up  an  agency  called
the Media Development and Diversity Agency. This agency will be governed  by
a board comprising nine members, three of whom will  be  directly  appointed
by the President. The remaining six will be appointed by  the  President  on
the recommendation of the National Assembly.

Persons who are office-bearers  or  employees  of  any  party,  movement  or
organisation  of  a  party-political  nature  are  disqualified  from  being
members of this board. The problem is that  ``office-bearer'',  ``employee''
and ``party-political nature'' are not adequately defined in the Bill. Is  a
person who receives an honorarium from a political party  employed  by  that
party? Does a body like  Cosatu  fall  within  the  definition  of  ``party-
political nature''?

The Bill deals only with present employees and office-bearers  of  political
parties. There is, with respect, a fundamental difference between an office-
bearer resigning from a position five years before the  nomination  and  one
doing so the day before the nomination.  The  failure  to  deal  with  these
issues leaves the possibility open for the board  to  develop  into  a  body
with political bias.

The question of where and  how  the  agency  will  be  financed  needs  more
consideration. Point 4 of  the  memorandum  to  the  Bill  states  that  the
Government's  contribution  will  be  covered  by  existing  allocations  to
departments within the  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework.  This  probably
means the GCIS. What influence will this give the GCIS over  the  board?  As
my learned friend the hon Durr said, he who pays the piper calls the tune.

Indeed, clause 15 of  the  Bill  deals  with  the  financing  of  the  Media
Development  and  Diversity  Agency  and  provides  that   funds   will   be
appropriated by Parliament. On the face of it, this  may  be  at  odds  with
what is set out in point 4 of the memorandum, at least in  the  short  term.
Funds may also be forthcoming from voluntary agreements  with  organisations
in  the  private  sector  as  well  as  from  grants  and  the  proceeds  of
investments.

The amounts bandied about in the committee to allow  for  the  establishment
of the agency and to allow it to achieve its objectives over the  next  five
years is in the order of R250 million. What proportion will be  provided  by
Government and what proportion will  be  provided  by  the  private  sector,
essentially the media industry?

In terms of clause 3(b), the Bill requires the agency to liaise with  Icasa.
This is not good enough. Icasa plays a role that is defined by  section  192
of our Constitution. In our view the  relationship  between  Icasa  and  the
agency needed to be spelled out exhaustively. While the  Bill  provides  for
the evaluation of projects receiving support, it  places  no  obligation  on
the beneficiaries to keep financial records or the standard  to  which  such
records are to be kept. With regard to the fact that at least a  portion  of
the amounts to be utilised will be from public  funds,  this  is  a  serious
shortcoming. The Bill only provides that the agency's financial  statements,
as opposed to the beneficiaries', be audited by the Auditor-General.

The provision relating to  the  promulgation  of  regulations  also  reveals
cause for  concern.  The  board  should  have  the  power  to  regulate  the
activities of the agency as an independent body. It is  our  view  that  the
Minister should merely promulgate such regulations and not play  a  role  in
defining the regulations in terms of which the agency is run.

Media diversity is a positive aspiration. However, for the  reasons  already
set out, the DA cannot support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson,  the  IFP  supports  the  development  of  media
diversity  and  the  empowerment,  in  this  regard,   of   the   previously
disadvantaged. In essence, no party representing persons who  were  excluded
from the mainstream of social and economic activity  for  so  many  decades,
indeed since the advert of  colonisation,  could  object  to  the  purported
objectives of this Bill, but it is a reality all over the  world  that  when
governments move into the terrain of the media, alarm bells  start  ringing.
A free press is essential in any country calling itself a democracy.

In this Bill a public-private partnership is being  proposed  to  assist  in
the development of print and electronic media and enable new  entrants  into
this industry. As in all democracies, it is  the  duty  of  citizens  to  be
vigilant  and  to  defend  democracy.  It  is  certainly  the  role  of  the
opposition to effect oversight and accountability, and  in  this  regard  we
all have a duty to ensure that our press develops independently of the  rich
and manipulative  tentacles  of  any  political  group  or  political  power
itself.

Yes, we have a duty to enable access to those wishing to contribute  and  to
those who can bring fresh, new, vibrant and independent  insights  into  our
national discourse. South Africans need to be reflected and  see  themselves
through new eyes and minds, but those minds must be free  to  roam  wherever
they choose.

We support this Bill, but our concerns are real. It is  essential  that  the
agency's work be open and transparent to all. [Applause.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, hon Minister, my colleagues,  I  think  I  must
first express our disappointment to learn that the  New  NP  is,  all  of  a
sudden, not supporting the Bill. We are disgusted, because in the course  of
finalising the Bill we went through it clause by clause. The hon member  the
doctor was there, diagnosing  it  together  with  us,  and  he,  of  course,
mentioned some concerns which were taken care of, in  a  way.  But  we  were
under the impression that they were supporting the  Bill.  Nevertheless,  we
have to learn a lesson from this. [Interjections.]

The  promotion  and  extension  of  a  platform  of  freedom  of  speech  to
previously marginalised and disadvantaged communities is  a  milestone,  for
this embraces one of the pillars among  the  objectives  characterising  our
Freedom Charter - that is, to liberate the African majority  in  particular,
and the black people in general.

Our rural masses in ghettos, farming communities  and  elsewhere  have  been
thirsty for this moment. As I stand here, they are asking me to remind  this
audience that, from time immemorial, they have demonstrated  a  high  degree
of media potential. In fact, long before the  powerful  Western-style  media
concept  was  introduced,  our  indigenous  people  championed  our  African
heritage media diversity. Perhaps I need to remind  those  hon  members  who
are confined to the Western concept of media about this history.

From the primitive society of centuries ago to the present day,  our  people
have been able to compose music and construct a chorus. I am  talking  of  a
melody - a tune married to a wonderful African rhythm. In the  event  of  an
unbecoming incident experienced by society, they would  suddenly  compose  a
propagating chorus that could be sung  by  the  entire  community,  and  the
message in that music and tune would normally expose the individual who  had
either violated society's moral values or committed a crime.  That  was  the
trend, irrespective of the status of the individual in question.

We must remember  that  that  indigenous  type  of  media  campaign  had  an
inherent degree of community awareness, discipline and education. It  was  a
wake-up call to whoever might fall into the same trap in future.

Yet, it is evident that our marginalised African majority  is  by  nature  a
God-given media engine,  because  we  have  praise  singers  that  have  the
capacity to draw the attention of an audience of over 10  000  in  a  public
place within a minute, even without using the services of either  a  marshal
or an usher to keep order.

Given that the media methods and types I have just characterised were  never
supported and institutionalised in a Western style of  doing  things,  today
our democratic Government is recognising the need to respond  to  previously
disadvantaged  communities.  In  this  transformation  process   one   would
encourage the targeted  communities  to  embrace  the  implementation  in  a
dignified and constructive  manner,  so  as  to  build  the  future  of  our
communities.

I am saying this because we continue to experience malicious media  coverage
on a daily basis, with our  media  often  distorting  Government's  positive
achievements. For instance, just last week, in my province, the North  West,
a certain journalist decided to take shortcuts when he/she was  supposed  to
have driven to a goat site project. For the sake of making  a  report,  that
person decided to embarrass our Minister of local  government  in  the  news
headlines.

For  the  communities  to  benefit,  we  believe  that  the  infrastructural
development will give us inspiration. Some other initiatives that have  been
pioneered by the community radio will need  to  be  supported.  I  refer  to
initiatives like focusing on community development issues, following  up  on
Letsema campaign activities and  keeping  communities  informed  of  service
delivery trends on an oversight basis.

Finally, I hope the agency will understand that it will  have  to  place  at
the top of its list of priorities the national issue of  HIV/Aids.  The  ANC
supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, let me  take  this  opportunity
to thank all those who participated in this debate, including those who  are
not going to vote for the Bill. I thank them for not voting for it.
I am glad I spoke after the hon Mr Kolweni, because for a minute  I  thought
he was actually going to compose and  sing  a  song  for  the  hon  Dr  Nel.
[Laughter.] But he was like the journalist who got  lost  somewhere  on  the
road.

With the permission of the Chairperson I would just like to respond to  what
some of the speakers have said. I thought Dr Nel made a very good  diagnosis
of the Bill in front of us, but I am afraid he is a bad doctor  because  his
prescription is a very bad one. I am assuming he himself did not  understand
what he was diagnosing, because, if he had  understood  it,  he  would  have
supported this Bill.

It seems to me that the opposition to the Bill stems  from  one  fundamental
feature, and that is that the board itself will not be  independent.  Now  I
wonder whether this fear comes from an understanding of the Bill -  I  think
if they read it properly they would not say that - or whether it comes  from
something  else.  That  something  else  is  a  deep-seated  suspicion  that
anything that the ANC-led Government does must by its nature have  something
funny in it. If one cannot see it  with  one's  eyes,  one  must  have  that
suspicion at the back of one's mind. I do not believe we  can  proceed  like
this.

I said when I introduced the Bill that if the Government had so  chosen,  we
could have set up the Media Development and Diversity Agency  with  our  own
funds. Indeed, as I have said, the bulk of the  funding  is  going  to  come
from the Government anyway. But we chose to go another  route  precisely  to
move away from the position where the Government  would  set  up  an  agency
fully funded and run it. We would  then  have  had  the  difficulty  of  the
Government being directly involved in all of these things.

We are therefore setting up an  independent  board,  and  hon  members  must
finish reading the Bill in this regard, because when the President  appoints
three people, he is going  to  appoint  two  of  them  from  the  commercial
sector. Now, I do not know how much further those hon members want us to  go
with respect to do this.
The independence of the board, as I tried to  argue,  is  not  just  derived
from the membership of  the  board,  but  is  derived  from  what  they  are
supposed to do and what the Bill  compels  them  to  do,  which  is  to  act
impartially.

We have tried to address the question  of  ensuring,  to  the  best  of  our
ability, that there will not be party-political interference. The fact  that
hon members sit here in this House is political,  so  everything  we  do  is
political in this country. We  want  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  party-
political interference, that the MDDA does not  become  an  ANC  agency.  Mr
Kolweni has a lot of praise singers singing praises for  him  and  the  ANC,
and I doubt whether the ANC needs more praise singers.

If people are genuine and really serious about wanting a  diversified  media
agency, they will support the Bill. But I have my doubts about whether  some
of the parties represented here are serious  about  wanting  to  extend  the
frontiers of not only being able to  receive  information,  but  also  being
able to impart it to  the  masses  of  our  people.  If  I  were  Mr  Lever,
following what we heard this afternoon in the motion from  Mr  Ackermann,  I
gravely doubt whether I would talk about honorariums and about he  who  pays
the piper calling the tune. If I were he, I  would  be  very  careful  about
what I said, given the motion moved this afternoon by Mr Ackermann.

It was Mr Durr who raised this and then the other hon member supported  him,
and I do not  know  why.  If  that  is  the  case,  then  members  must  ask
themselves which of the print media  do  not  rely  practically  wholly  for
profitability on advertising. There is not a  single  member  of  the  print
media in the country that can survive purely on the  basis  of  circulation.
So he who pays the piper  in  this  case  is  the  private  sector  and  the
Government. We do a lot of advertising in the print media.

I regret very much that there are several parties - three,  by  my  count  -
that have not found it in themselves to support this  very  important  piece
of legislation. My only hope is that they will soon learn that they  made  a
mistake and will come back to the House and say: ``We  are  terribly  sorry,
we should have voted for the Bill in the first place, but now that we are  a
bit wiser, we will come back and say that we agree; it is a good  Bill''.  I
thank the Council once again for its attention. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance  with  section  75  of  the  Constitution  (New
National Party, African Christian  Democratic  Party  and  Democratic  Party
dissenting.)

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 2 - Parliament:

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, this is an important step  by  the
National Council of Provinces. In the two years that we have  been  in  this
House we did not debate the Vote of Parliament, but we  are  now  doing  our
democratic and constitutional duty and reviewing our own performance in  the
past financial year. I think it is an important step which we have  to  make
part of our parliamentary practice.

I am sure hon members have looked at the various submissions, the  excellent
documentation provided by the Treasury and the Department  of  Finance,  and
have noted that in the financial  year  whose  finances  are  one  debating,
Parliament  was  provided  an  allocation  of   R422,6   million   for   its
utilisation. The Parliamentary services component of that allocation,  which
is what we would often focus upon, was R268 million. It was  utilised  in  a
number of areas of  expenditure,  the  bulk  going  to  the  office  of  the
Secretary to Parliament and a  large  proportion,  R62  million,  being  put
towards facilities for members of Parliament.

The new framework of financial accountability  that  we  are  using  in  our
country provides us, I believe, with a useful set of criteria for  assessing
and monitoring South African public institutions and  their  use  of  public
finances. We have in our  country  a  piece  of  legislation  we  took  very
seriously when considering it in the  National  Council  of  Provinces,  the
Public Finance Management Act.

Unfortunately for ourselves as Parliament, the Act  does  not  regulate  our
utilisation of public finances. We do not fall within  the  ambit  of  those
institutions addressed by the Public Finance  Management  Act.  Happily,  we
are taking steps to remedy this omission. The current  law  which  regulates
our use of public finances is found  in  fragmented  pieces  of  legislation
such as certain aspects of the Powers and Privileges of Parliament  Act  and
the older Exchequer Act. But, as I have indicated, we  are  regulating  this
current situation and will be rectifying the gap that exists at  the  moment
so that as Parliament we fall, in future,  within  the  framework  that  all
public institutions are governed within to ensure that we are as  responsive
as we are demanding other institutions to be.

We have resolved that there must be a visible and  public  set  of  criteria
which impact on ourselves  as  Parliament  and,  perhaps  more  importantly,
which also introduce accountability and  transparency  to  the  legislatures
throughout the nation - in our provincial legislatures as well  as  here  in
Parliament. In the  last  financial  year  we  have  devoted  some  time  to
reviewing the  budgeting  process  utilised  to  arrive  at  the  funds  for
Parliament and we have also begun to discuss how we ensure  that  the  funds
we have voted are used within the terms of  the  constitutional  mandate  of
the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.

I think if we go  through  a  brief  review  of  our  actions  in  the  last
financial year, we will get a useful and perhaps telling set of  information
about ourselves and our  performance.  In  the  last  calendar  year,  which
incorporates the last financial  year,  we  considered  over  69  pieces  of
legislation. A number of these were section 76  Bills.  I  believe  13  were
section 76 Bills. For each of the 13 we held meetings  and  public  hearings
in the nine provincial legislatures of South Africa. That involved  a  great
deal of work for permanent delegates of the National Council of Provinces.

In the weeks of session that we had in 2001,  more  than  20  meetings  were
held in provincial legislatures led by members who are  permanent  delegates
within the National Council of  Provinces.  We  briefed  committees  at  the
provincial level. Permanent delegates tabled questions  for  oral  reply  as
well as questions for written reply and participated in a  number  of  joint
meetings  and  public  hearings  with  the   National   Assembly   portfolio
committees.

In an effort to improve the National  Council  of  Provinces'  co-ordination
and  responsiveness  to  provinces  and  our   mandate   from   within   the
Constitution, the presiding officers of the National  Council  of  Provinces
held very useful meetings with presiding officers  and  business  committees
in the Eastern Cape province, the Mpumalanga  province  and  the  provincial
legislature of KwaZulu-Natal.
Through these interactions we began to get a much truer sense of the  nature
of our relationship and interaction with  provincial  legislatures  and  the
degree to which we were providing sufficient liaison  and  co-ordination  to
ensure that indeed the National Council of Provinces  becomes  a  forum  for
the presentation of provincial interests.

Arising from the interaction with provincial legislatures a policy  workshop
on the further development of the National Council of Provinces was held  in
2001, and the results of that workshop will inform much of our work in  this
financial year and the years ahead.

There is therefore a great deal of activity and there has been in  the  past
year a great deal of progress. We have also as Parliament achieved  a  great
deal of noteworthy  progress  with  both  our  Houses  working  together  on
several important initiatives. A number of these initiatives have been at  a
significant cost to Parliament - sadly, often an unanticipated cost due,  in
my view, to our inadequate and often unco-ordinated budgeting processes.

One of the elements  where  we  have  seen  a  great  deal  of  activity  is
Parliament's increasing  role  in  international  bodies.  Of  note  is  the
election last year of Ms Gwen Mahlangu to  the  position  of  chair  of  the
women's co-ordinating committee  of  the  Inter-Parliamentary  Union,  which
also entails an ex officio seat in the IPU executive. Of note  as  well  was
the election of the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly to  the  finance
committee of the IPU and the important role played by  many  of  our  public
representatives in IPU conferences, in leading standing  committee  meetings
and the leading roles they  played  within  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary
Association.

Members would be aware that the Chairperson of the NCOP is one  of  the  six
representatives of Africa  on  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary  Association
executive and that this has led to her playing a role in  various  seminars,
postelection training workshops and other  activities  of  the  Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association. [Applause.]

Our  Parliament  this  year   also   hosted   the   important   Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association Indian Ocean Rim Media and Parliament  conference,
a conference that has led to the development  of  an  interesting  code  for
future relations between parliaments in the Commonwealth  and  media  within
the Commonwealth. I am sure all of us, given the debate we have  just  heard
today, are committed as members  of  Parliament  to  ensuring  that  in  our
democracy, while we certainly have the duty of  creating  a  diverse  media,
freedom of expression exists and continues to thrive.

The CPA Indian Ocean Rim Media Conference  had  as  one  of  its  objectives
ensuring that parliaments do indeed actively seek to support the putting  in
place of a thriving, free and active media. Members will also be aware  that
whenever  the  United  Nations  holds  a  world   conference,   the   Inter-
Parliamentary  Union   usually   sets   about   convening   a   meeting   of
parliamentarians to deliberate on substantive issues arising from the  world
conference agenda  and  to  prepare  a  parliamentary  contribution  to  the
deliberations and outcomes.

In the year 2001, our  Parliament  led  the  parliamentary  meeting  on  the
occasion of  the  World  Conference  against  Racism.  I  noted  with  great
interest that our Parliament made an important contribution to  the  success
of the World Conference against Racism as  well  as  members'  contributions
during  the  parliamentarians'  meeting.  The  meeting  of  parliamentarians
adopted the resolution that was then presented to the plenary of  the  World
Conference against Racism by Speaker Ginwala, the Speaker  of  the  National
Assembly.

In this financial year, our Parliament and  the  IPU  will  jointly  host  a
meeting  of  parliamentarians  to  coincide  with  the   World   Summit   on
Sustainable Development, which South Africa is hosting  this  year.  We  are
very unusual in having the fortune to host world conferences of  the  United
Nations in two consecutive years. It is most unusual. I  do  not  think  the
occasion will be repeated in the years to come, so I hope we will make  full
use of the opportunities  provided  by  our  hosting  these  very  important
conferences and that all members will ensure that we  are  informed  on  the
issues related to sustainable development and how we make a contribution  to
ensuring that we play a role in shaping the content of the  resolution  that
will emerge from the world conference  as  well  as  parliamentary  activity
that must be a direct result of the conference  to  which  we  will  make  a
contribution.

Equally noteworthy in this last financial year was the  joint  parliamentary
assembly of the ACP-EU representatives that was hosted  by  our  Parliament.
The assembly was  a  major  undertaking  that  tested  the  resolve  of  the
presiding officers, the Secretary to  Parliament,  his  staff  and  our  own
members of Parliament.  I  think  we  have  to  congratulate  the  staff  of
Parliament and the Secretary on  having  managed  this  immense  project  so
successfully. [Applause.]

I watched our Secretary with great interest during  that  conference  and  I
was quite astounded at his ability to  juggle  so  many  different  sets  of
demands in his two hands. I wondered whether he had grown  other  hands  and
was utilising them just for that occasion.  Certainly  our  staff  played  a
sterling  role  and  made  a  major  contribution  to  a   very   successful
conference.

Having said that, however, we have  to  say  that  while  budgeting,  for  a
number of these events we have failed to ensure that we provide  projections
for the hosting of such events in our budget. We have known for a number  of
years, for example, that we as a country  will  host  the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development, but we did not anticipate that  there  would  be  a
parliamentarians' meeting. Therefore we did not  provide,  as  part  of  our
submission to Treasury, a funding  request  for  Parliament  to  participate
actively in such an event.

I believe it is imperative, as we budget, that we recognise and provide  for
the increasing international role that South Africa's Parliament  is  having
to play.

Our growing international activity has not led  to  a  neglect  of  our  own
commitment to strengthening ties with Africa. As we  speak  about  UN  world
conferences, we might imagine  that  we  do  not  have  interaction  on  our
continent. Happily we  do.  At  the  parliamentary  level,  our  members  of
Parliament continue to serve  on  the  SADC  Parliamentary  Forum  executive
committee.

This year our Deputy Chairperson led our delegation to the  plenary  meeting
in Namibia. Our Deputy Chairperson has also  played  a  very  important  and
useful  role  in  assisting  parliamentarians   in   Burundi   to   consider
adjustments to their constitution so that it allows for  the  new  democracy
that they are trying to build in a  nonconflictual  environment.  We  really
congratulate our Deputy presiding  officers  on  the  role  that  they  have
played there. [Applause.] Ms Ntlabati, as members would be aware,  continues
to serve as one our three representatives on the executive committee of  the
SADC Parliamentary Forum.

In the year 2001 both the presiding officers of Parliament  and  members  of
Parliament attended  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary  Association's  Africa
conference in Nigeria - a democratic and free Nigeria. We  presented  papers
on disaster management, on regional  trade  policy  and  on  strategies  for
addressing poverty. In addition, South Africa led a briefing  discussion  on
the Pan-African Parliament protocol,  which  was  welcomed  by  the  African
Parliaments present at that meeting.

We have continued to build on these links and  are  planning  a  meeting  of
parliamentarians in June this year, to  precede  the  African  Union  launch
meeting that South Africa will host in July. Parliament has devoted time  to
full and  careful  consideration  of  the  African  Union  and  Pan  African
Parliament protocols in pursuit of the objective of  ensuring  that  African
parliaments play an effective and full role in giving life  to  the  African
Union and the Pan African Parliament.
All these activities, and many others to which I cannot  refer  for  reasons
of time, point to a very active and engaged Parliament. The core issue  that
we must address is: Are we planning effectively, and are the people  of  our
country receiving value for  money  from  their  public  representatives?  A
review of Parliament-based work and province-based  activity  suggests  that
there is value for money, yet close  scrutiny  of  our  budget  process  and
planning indicates a serious  need  to  improve  performance.  Sometimes  we
acted without a clear set of plans. We now have  sufficient  experience,  in
our view, to inform our financial planning,  and  we  need  to  improve  our
budget process so that  there  is  greater  certainty  that  we  are  making
decisions that have a clear and defensible rationale.

In addition to this more focused and informed budget would have  to  be  the
inclusion of aspects of our work that are not fully funded at this time.  In
my view, our committees require improved  support:  full  research  support,
high-level managerial support and assistance in setting out  strategies  and
work plans. Our committees have done  well  in  their  role  of  considering
legislation, but, in my view, we rely too much  on  intuitive  feel,  rather
than on the investigation of  potential  outcome  and  impact.  Eight  years
should certainly lead to improved practice and to  fewer  untidy  amendments
and omissions.

Too many of the pieces of legislation that come before  our  Parliament  are
Bills that are amending legislation that we have  passed.  This  means  that
the intuitive feel that we currently utilise has to be put aside for a  more
informed assessment of Bills that we consider so that  we  pass  legislation
that does  not  require  amendment  the  following  year,  but  is  able  to
withstand the test of time and practice, in order to stand as a  full  piece
of law that we have considered fully and passed with clear consideration.

Another  area  requiring   attention   is   our   contribution   to   public
participation. We played an important part  in  supporting  and  encouraging
public participation in the first Parliament, particularly as we  wrote  the
new Constitution. We have to ask now: To  what  degree  are  the  people  of
South  Africa  enjoying  opportunities  to  shape  the  thinking  of   their
Parliament? We all  need  to  review  this  area  of  our  work  and  devise
responses that ensure that all South  Africans  contribute  to  shaping  our
democracy.

The various committees that have carried out oversight visits  in  the  past
financial year have to be congratulated. We must  congratulate  hon  members
on  the  last  province  week,  in  which  I  understand  a  full   set   of
consultations and interactions occurred. This is the kind of  work  that  we
must do. However, in addition to visiting  public  institutions,  I  believe
that we should also consider  holding  people's  hearings  as  part  of  any
committee programme, so that the direct experience of South Africans  shapes
our  responses  and  our  planning.  Undertaking  such  work  will   require
financial resources, and therefore our plans for 2003-04  must  provide  for
this.

Parliament has not been able, in this financial  year,  to  secure  all  the
funds that it has felt it needs. This poses  difficult  challenges  for  our
operations in this financial year.  I  hope  hon  members,  who  essentially
shape the budget, will bear with us as we face the difficulties  that  arise
from not receiving the full budget that we sought.

Our budget committee needs to carefully monitor our progress  in  this  year
and ensure that it clearly identifies where the areas of need lie  and  that
it is able to provide full and proper motivation for whatever submission  it
makes to the national Treasury. We need to record  far  more  carefully  any
gaps and lapses in our funding provisions in order  that,  for  2003-04,  we
make a submission that will ensure that Parliament has the Vote that  allows
it to play its proper role. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, it is indeed a privilege to  follow
upon the presiding officer. One should carefully consider the  role  of  the
presiding officers when one debates the Vote on Parliament, given  the  fact
that the leadership of any institution  really  determines  its  course  and
outcomes. I am not here today as a praise singer, but  merely  to  draw  the
hon members' attention to the fact that  we  can  be  justly  proud  of  our
presiding officers. If I had the attention of the DP in this very  important
debate, I do believe that we would be able to progress  as  an  institution.
[Interjections.]

Given the fact that there is attention from some members of  some  political
parties and less attention from other members  of  other  political  parties
because of more compelling and pressing  political  difficulties  that  they
encounter, I shall proceed where  I  left  off  and  say  that  one  has  to
recognise and note with a great sense  of  pride  the  role  played  by  our
presiding officers, not only in the NCOP, but in the  National  Assembly  as
well Parliament as a whole.

Given the fact that we are now in the NCOP, it  is  important  to  recognise
the specific or particular role played  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,
particularly in terms of enhancing and promoting gender issues.  If  I  were
to list some of the organisations to which  our  Chairperson  belongs,  then
one would have a clear indication of the sense of  commitment  over  a  very
long and sustained period in this regard.

Our Chairperson is a member of the  National  Network  on  Violence  Against
Women, the English Academy of South Africa, the International Women's  Forum
and the SA Association of Women Graduates. We are all aware of  the  various
undertakings that she has made in  order  to  promote  gender  equality  and
improve the lot of women. She also serves  in  other  very  important  fora,
amongst which are the following.  She  is  joint  president  of  the  Inter-
Parliamentary Union branch of the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary  Association,
an African regional representative and executive  committee  member  of  the
Commonwealth  Parliamentary  Association  and  a  joint   sponsor   of   the
Parliamentary Millennium Project.

We are also aware - and this House has passed a resolution in this regard  -
passed in terms of the commitment that our  Chairperson  has  to  education,
particularly tertiary education. We passed a resolution with  a  great  deal
of pride in recognition of her services in the tertiary field when  she  was
appointed as a chancellor in the Western Cape. I do not want to  exhaust  my
time giving accolades to our presiding officers,  but  I  merely  wished  to
note the significant role that they have played in this particular arena.

I believe that when we look at this Budget Vote we have to locate  the  NCOP
in the parliamentary and legislative  landscape  of  South  Africa.  We  are
inextricably bound to the National Assembly  and  cannot  pretend  that  our
activities are not part of and should not work in tandem with those  of  the
National Assembly. Similarly, we cannot ignore the fact that we are here  in
this  House  as  indirectly   elected   representatives   of   the   various
legislatures in our country. Consequently, we have  a  particular  role  and
responsibility in our interaction with the provinces.

We also cannot ignore the fact that we have a particular  responsibility  in
interacting very closely with local government. We  have  Salga,  which,  in
terms of the Constitution, has to play a role in Parliament and we have  the
various provincial associations with which we must interact.  I  do  believe
that  the  delegations  from  the  various  provinces  have   a   particular
responsibility in ensuring that there is a  nexus  and  dynamic  interaction
with provincial associations. That is but one part of the spectrum.

We also have a particular responsibility  in  promoting  and  enhancing  co-
operative governance. It is a constitutional  responsibility.  In  addition,
we   have   the   responsibility   of   ensuring   that   we   foster   good
intergovernmental relations. That is another responsibility.  If  one  looks
at the broad dimension of our activities  in  terms  of  the  constitutional
obligations and the general obligations,  one  certainly  has  to  recognise
that the capacity that is provided for  members  in  the  NCOP  is  somewhat
limited.

When we talk about a  committee  in  the  NCOP,  we  do  not  talk  about  a
committee that deals  with  one  portfolio.  Ours  are  cluster  committees,
select  committees  that  deal  with  various  aspects  in  the  legislative
process. Yet we find it very difficult to  accept  that  the  allocation  of
resources in terms of committee work differs between the  NA  and  NCOP.  We
understand that the NA, notwithstanding the fact that each NA  committee  is
responsible for only one portfolio, has the greater allocation in  terms  of
committee funds than that of the NCOP. [Applause.]

It is significant that we raise this because, besides doing  the  work  that
we do within Parliament, we have a particular responsibility to
provinces. The Chairperson quite correctly pointed  out  the  responsibility
of members of the committees to go out to the provinces and brief  them  and
be involved in  the  process  of  negotiating  final  mandates.  That  is  a
dimension which certainly involves costs and resources. I  believe  that  it
is a matter that we will have to deal with very closely.

Having identified  this  landscape  here,  one  should  ask:  What  are  the
challenges that we face as the NCOP? I am glad that Mr Kolweni  spoke  about
a visit to the  rural  hinterland  of  Kgalagadi.  We  went  as  a  combined
multiparty delegation to enquire about what was going on in  the  rural  and
urban nodes identified by the President.  This  process  was  undertaken  by
nine delegations in nine provinces at the same time. The outcome of  it  was
quite interesting. For example, we were able to verify that  the  journalist
who suggested that this particular development was a fabrication was  indeed
wrong. He certainly did  not  make  the  effort  to  go  out  to  the  rural
hinterland  where  this  project  was  being  undertaken  to  interview  and
interact with the people.

We can come back with a great deal of pride to say that we  now  know  about
``die boerbok.''  Now  we  know  that  there  are  African  women  who  were
previously marginalised and were on the periphery of  the  economy  who  are
actively engaged in developing and growing the economy in  their  particular
areas.

We can also say that there are challenges  that  we  have  identified  as  a
result of our visit - challenges in terms of cross-boundary  municipalities,
co-ordination  between  district   councils   and   local   government   and
corelationships at a horizontal level between one  province  and  other.  In
fact,  we  will  have  to  look  again  at  the  issue   of   cross-boundary
municipalities. I think we have a responsibility, notwithstanding our party-
political affiliation, to raise this matter from a provincial perspective.

It is for this reason that we are encouraging our  members  to  support  the
view that the next provincial week should be dedicated to local  government,
because amongst the responsibilities that we undertook during this  week  we
reached out to local government. We went out to district councils  where  we
did briefings on matters that  affected  them,  such  as  national  disaster
management and crossing of the floor, because local  government  councillors
are affected by that.

The great  degree  of  enthusiasm  with  which  we  were  received  and  the
consciousness of the various  councillors  on  their  part  in  relation  to
legislation that is being passed were  quite  amazing  and  astounding.  For
example, they wanted to know, and they had views about, the  frequency  with
which the crossing over should take place. They  were  concerned  about  the
fact  that  there  was  a   distinction   between   ward   councillors   and
proportionally  representative  councillors.  They  wanted  to   know,   for
example, what the position would be if a member of a party  crossed  to  the
other side  where  no  such  party  existed  but  was  a  registered  party.
Important questions were asked, meaning that there is a need  to  bring  the
legislative process to local government.

In that context I would like to say that we have commenced and  we  can  say
with pride that the NCOP has piloted the  move  towards  using  IT  for  the
benefit of efficient governance. Today we can say with pride that  the  NCOP
can interact with its provinces electronically through computers.  It  is  a
seamless and efficient process. One should then say: Should it  not  happen,
or should we not extend and expand this process  so  that  we  can  interact
with local government  as  well  in  order  to  become  more  efficient  and
effective?

I could speak for hours and hours on this  particular  aspect.  As  I  stand
here, I take pride not only in the  leadership  provided  by  the  presiding
officers, but in the chairpersons and in  each  and  every  member  of  this
Council,  irrespective  of  party-political   affiliation.   I   think   the
difference between this House and  the  other  House  is  that  we  somewhat
depoliticise our commitment to transformation and service delivery. It is  a
collective interest and we look at the common good.

I think that by ensuring that we continue on this course we  will  create  a
bond between the national Parliament and provincial  legislatures.  We  will
assimilate local government  into  this  very  important  task  and  thereby
fulfil the important role that we were mandated to  play  in  terms  of  the
Constitution.

The areas of budget and members' interests will be dealt with by  colleagues
who will speak later. [Applause.]

The TEMPORARY CHAIRPERSON (Mr A E VAN NIEKERK): I just, for clarity's  sake,
want to state that when the hon Surty referred to the  ``boerbok'',  he  was
not referring to me but to an animal. [Laughter.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I want to thank the  hon  Surty,  who  just  sat
down, for his good offices this year, for his many  interventions,  for  his
help, kindness and consideration, also to us in the smaller parties. I  want
to thank him for that in the smooth functioning of Parliament.

Though Madam Chairperson and I have different political persuasions, I  have
to say that she brought great respect  and  gravitas  to  this  institution,
both here and in her travels abroad. We as members wish  to  thank  her  for
that.

One of our duties as parliamentarians is, of course,  to  uphold  that  very
dignity and to respect our parliamentary institutions. Judgments fairly  and
unfairly are being made about how we behave  and  how  we  have  been  found
wanting. Parliament needs to inculcate a sense of servant leadership and  to
reflect wise custodianship of our resources and natural  interests  and  the
enhancement  of  sound  social  and  political  values.   Indeed,   we   are
establishing not only new  laws,  but,  in  this  fledging  Parliament,  new
conventions and new patterns of behaviour. The question, of course,  in  the
words of our Chairperson, is: Are we providing value for money?

I want to address the House on something that disturbs me, and it has to  do
with the pattern of lobbying that is  getting  out  of  proportion  in  this
Place. Every other budget cannot be a cause  for  celebration.  Every  other
state board or body entertains us like princes - which we  are  not  -  with
fine music, orchestras, jazz concerts, fine wines and tables  groaning  with
expensive food, paid for by others. It is a subtle form  of  corruption.  We
really need to distinguish  between  wise  stewardship  and  waste,  between
reasonable socialisation and  self-indulgence  at  the  expense  of  others,
between information  and  the  need  therefor,  and  entertainment.  Private
companies like Vodacom, which struck a deal in the DRC, have the excuse  for
a planeload of MPs to go  and  celebrate  the  event  in  Kinshasa  at  huge
expense. Somebody has to pay somewhere.

Some overseas parliamentary visits  are  not  in  the  public  interest  and
achieve very little at huge expense. This  is  a  poor  country.  I  am  not
pleading for a Spartan institution, nor am I making judgments  on  anyone  -
and I include myself in this. But I plead for a sense of proportion.

We see the same trends in provincial governments and municipalities. We  see
mayors throwing huge parties at public expense to welcome themselves. It  is
nothing. It is nice if a friend would just  throw  one  such  a  party.  The
excuse is then: Someone in the private sector is paying. We all  know  there
is no such thing as a free lunch.

When I was in the UK, I often had  to  attend  parliamentary  events,  often
with the Prime Minister in 10 Downing Street. All I got was a glass of  wine
or juice and some cheese if I was lucky. I found in my  travels  around  the
world, in the 72 countries I have had the honour  of  serving  and  visiting
and trading in, that the richer the country, the more austere  the  catering
arrangements.

I call upon this House and chairpersons of committees to reflect  upon  what
I have said, so that we do introduce a sense of proportion. It gives us  the
wrong impression. We are all overweight and we do not need it.  We  need  to
look at this. [Applause.]

The TEMPORARY CHAIRPERSON (Mr A  E  Van  Niekerk):  Maybe  we  are  not  all
overweight.

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, when I looked up and  saw  you  in  the  Chair  I
wondered for a moment if the crossing-the-floor process had already begun.

I have appreciation for the efforts which the women in both Houses have  put
into obtaining an adequate budget for the operation of our workplace  and  I
want to thank them for that as well as for the  lustre  which  they  add  to
Parliament.

I  do  not  want  to  concentrate  on  mere  percentage  increases  in  this
particular Vote, or how this relates to inflation. Nor do I want to  comment
on the political aspects of the stature that is accorded, or  not,  to  this
Parliament by the present Government - not necessarily through  the  budget,
but rather through its approach to Parliament's role and the  importance  of
it in the national psyche.

What I want to look at, as an ordinary member  of  Parliament,  is  how  the
money is spent here. I will look at how  the  appearance  and  operation  of
Parliament strike me as a member and how it is perceived  through  the  eyes
of visitors. I must say that if  my  observations  were  more  pleasing,  it
would be easier to defend increases in the  budget  than  when  the  overall
impression is  one  of  quite  a  bit  of  neglect  and  a  lack  of  proper
management.

I am completely  unmoved  by  the  much-heralded  and  enormously  expensive
security system that we have installed. I feel no more nor any  less  secure
now than I did when I arrived here. I never did feel the need  for  millions
of rand to be spent on  the  security  of  members,  when  our  constituents
cannot lay claim to any such protection - despite the fact that they are  in
much more need of protection than we are.

What really bugs  me  is  that  these  facilities  have  not  been  properly
completed and do not always work. I could not believe my  eyes  or  my  ears
when I asked why the side entrance to the Marks Building is not in  constant
use, despite the fact that it is the side which has to be used  by  disabled
members. The answer was that we do not have enough police  officers  to  man
both that entrance and the Parliament  Street  entrance.  Why  then  did  we
erect expensive security measures at these entrances?  As  for  the  vehicle
entrance through Parliament Street, this seems to be  opened  or  closed  at
whim, but certainly not according to a detectable pattern.

The overall appearance of Parliament  is  also  cause  for  concern.  It  is
marred by discarded cigarette butts and dirty walls and floors. As a  matter
of fact, an air of general neglect and lack of management pervades the  look
of Parliament. It does not present the proud  face  which  I  want  to  show
visitors. The management of the establishment clearly  needs  a  bit  of  an
overhaul.

On a personal level, but I am not only speaking for myself, I want to  raise
the issue of the replacement of computers which were stolen.  This  has  now
been  the  subject  of  correspondence  between  me  and  the  Secretary  to
Parliament for more than a year, and we live opposite each other  -  on  one
street. At my last enquiry, I  was  asked  to  resubmit  my  claims  as  the
correspondence had been mislaid. Hopefully this is an exception rather  than
the rule.

I would also have liked a reallocation of  money  to  improve  communication
between the legislatures and the NCOP. Our contact with  the  provinces  and
our provincial visits are, I feel, totally inadequate.  We  spend  money  on
duplicating  National  Assembly  briefings,  but  committees  do  not   have
sufficient funds to do their  oversight  work  in  the  provinces.  This  is
leaving the second House with something like an identity crisis.

Having a new House with functional translation services  is  very  good  and
well and I am happy for it, but who believes that sitting as  provinces  has
actually led - and I mean sitting as we do here - to a provincial  point  of
view being expressed in the House? I think this would be  much  more  likely
to happen if we were able to spend money on visiting provinces  as  teams  -
this was highlighted by the hon Surty - and coming back  to  report  on  our
shared experiences.

I want to refer again to  the  crossing-the-floor  clause  in  which  we  as
members of the NCOP are caught up without any real voice as to our  destiny.
I want to put my party's position: Crossing must take  place  with  all  the
privileges of the seat intact. In other words, if  a  member  joins  another
party,  the  political  funding  which  this  Vote  controls  and  which  is
allocated to members by Parliament must move with him or  her.  Funding  has
been allocated to parties according to the number of members,  and  we  feel
that this must remain the criterion.

On that joyful note, working out how much richer we are going  to  be  after
June, I thank you.

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I wish to  say  at  the  outset  that  I  fully
support the Chief Whip, Mr Surty, when  he  states  that  there  can  be  no
justification. I also believe there can be no  justification  for  portfolio
committees of the National Assembly getting more budgetary allocations  than
select committees  which  deal  with  a  cluster  of  departments.  That  is
certainly something that needs urgent attention.

I also agree with Mr Durr that there is room for some frugality  at  certain
functions and so on, and that maybe we should rather look at what is  really
required by some of our members. As has been pointed  out,  there  is  still
room  for  improvement  in  capacity  of  members  as  far  as  research  is
concerned, etc.

In this House we must continue to  be  informed  by  the  perspective  which
guided us when we drafted the Constitution which gave  birth  to  the  NCOP.
Two of the most important principles which were  part  of  that  perspective
were participatory democracy on the one hand,  and  co-operative  governance
on the other.

In the words of President Mbeki at  the  NCOP  national  conference,  during
1998, the vision of which the NCOP is an expression is  fundamental  to  the
success of the new democracy which we sought to fashion. This  is  sometimes
forgotten by the critics of  this  institution,  because  if  we  fail,  our
democracy, as it was  envisaged  by  those  of  us  who  were  part  of  the
Constitution-process and of the new dispensation in this country, will  also
fail.

Of course, there have been difficulties and misunderstandings, which is  not
surprising because the NCOP is new and its processes are complicated and  it
is still a work in progress. But as the refurbishment  and  the  renewal  of
our Chamber are progressing well - when I peeped in there  yesterday  I  saw
that - so is our institution. This is confirmed in the excellent  and  well-
researched new book by Prof Christina Murray and Lia  Nijzink,  the  reading
of which, by the way, I recommend to all members.

It is stated in this book that the NCOP is beginning to demonstrate that  it
can realise the vision  of  the  Constitution-makers  and  contribute  in  a
meaningful way to the  process  of  deepening  representative  democracy  in
South Africa, and that the NCOP has made enormous progress in the six  years
since it was established.  Most  importantly,  they  have  found  that  most
delegates show a clear grasp of the NCOP's role  and  goals,  and  they  are
aware of its procedures  and  reasons  for  provincial  involvement  in  the
national sphere of Government.

I sometimes think that our role is often misunderstood. Yes,  maybe  because
the processes are complicated, but  I  also  think  sometimes  some  of  our
critics really do not understand and do not have a grasp  of  the  processes
and what this House really stands for. Because  this  is  not  just  another
second House. It is not a continuation of the old Senate  by  another  name.
It is, in fact, a unique institution and not like  any  other  second  House
anywhere in the world.

The role of the NCOP must  be  seen  in  the  context  of  a  constitutional
commitment to co-operative government,  which  means  that  national  policy
must be sensitive to local and provincial needs and concerns, and  must  not
ignore or ride roughshod over them. It also means that  municipalities,  and
particularly provinces, should not act in isolation but that  they  must  be
deeply integrated in the national political process.

Our House is designed for this to happen and, as the  Chief  Whip  has  also
indicated, there is really a keen interest and almost a hunger that we  have
experienced on the ground - in the municipalities and  in  the  provinces  -
for more involvement. It is clearly set out in  the  Constitution  that  our
main function is to participate in the national law-making  process  and  to
provide a national forum for public debate of provincial issues.
Many provincial legislatures  do  excellent  work  in  properly  considering
section 76 legislation and in coming up with proposals to  make  amendments,
which we can then deliberate upon here and  which  are  successful  in  many
instances. But where there is a lot of room  for  improvement,  and  what  I
find lacking is proactive actions  from  the  provinces,  to  initiate,  for
instance, legislative proposals which  can  come  through  to  the  national
level, to feed the permanent delegates with questions which they would  like
answers to or specifically to put motions here on behalf of  the  provinces.
I find that there is really a lack of that  proactiveness  coming  from  the
provinces, and I believe that we should do whatever we can to  get  them  to
do this.

In this regard it was encouraging, I  must  say,  to  note  yesterday  in  a
workshop of the committee that I  chair,  how  many  provincial  members  of
Parliament were interested, how enthusiastic they  were  about  it  and  the
keen interest shown by them. From the province that I  come  from,  KwaZulu-
Natal, there were no less than 10 members of Parliament present.

There can be no doubt that the one aspect I really want to address  also  is
the state of the nation address by our President at  the  beginning  of  the
year which we all sat and listened to, in which  there  were  so  many  very
important  issues  and  matters  raised  by  the  President  which  were  of
importance to the provinces and to us as a House. But then that was only  to
find that we were excluded from debating there and, that  if  we  wanted  to
participate in that most important debate which sets the tone for the  year,
we had to sit in the gallery of that House and watch as spectators.  But  we
cannot participate. I can find  no  justification  or  reason  for  that.  I
really want to plead that this should be looked at again.

The address by the President, however important it is later in the  year,  I
believe cannot replace our participation in that debate at the beginning  of
the year.

As the President said in the opening address this year:


  Of decisive importance to the millions of our people and  the  future  of
  our country, as we meet here today, the central question we will have  to
  answer at the end of the  day  is  whether  what  we  are  doing  as  the
  legislature ...

The was addressing us as well -


  ... the executive and the judiciary, as well as  the  fourth  estate,  is
  helping to lift from the shoulders of our people the  intolerable  burden
  of poverty and underdevelopment.

Certainly, poverty and underdevelopment in our provinces and  in  the  rural
areas are of utmost importance  to  us  as  provincial  representatives.  He
said: ``This fourth opening session of  our  second  democratic  Parliament,
including the debate that will  take  place  next  week,  must  answer  this
question in a frank, honest and forthright manner. But we are excluded  from
that. We are excluded from participating in that debate.  Yet,  we  are  the
voice - we should be the voice - of the provinces and of our people  in  the
provinces at national level.
I therefore conclude by saying that we have come a long way.  We  have  done
exceptionally well and also so under the leadership of  our  Chairperson.  I
agree with every word that the Chief Whip has said. I  really  believe  that
we have excellent leadership in this House.  However,  I  believe  there  is
still a long road to travel. Our work is a work in progress. I believe  that
we have everything that there needs to be. We have the talent in this  House
to really deepen democracy in South Africa  in  the  interests  of  all  our
people. [Applause.]

Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson and hon  members,  the  aim  of  this  Vote,  as
mentioned in the Estimates of National Expenditure of 2002, is:


  ... to provide the support services required by Parliament to fulfil  its
  constitutional functions, to  assist  political  parties  represented  in
  Parliament to secure administrative support and service constituents, and
  to provide members of Parliament with the necessary facilities.

The Estimates of Expenditure identify specifically what members'  facilities
ought to be, which is what input will focus on in respect of how the  budget
should assist MPs to fulfil their constitutional obligations.

Ngelishwa, ndifumanisa ukuba  izinto  ezininzi  kwintetho  ebendiza  kuyenza
sele uSomlono, kunye noMbexeshi oyiNtloko, bezichaphazele.

Kambe,  ndiza  kugqaba-gqabaza  ndithethe  ngalaa  mba  umalunga  nemingeni.
Ndibaxhasa ncakasana abantu  ababini  abazizithethi  bekwangabakhokeli  bale
Ndlu,   uMhlalingaphambili   ohloniphekileyo   uNaledi   Pandor   noMbexeshi
oyiNtloko  uTat'  uSurty.  Ngaphandle  kokuba  babe   ezi   ngxaki   esinazo
bazibonile ngekuba abasikhokelanga kule Ndlu.

Ndiyitsho le nto ngenxa yokubona eminye yemingeni esinayo. Izolo  oku  sithi
masiphume apha eKapa,  sithi  bhazalala  phaya  ebantwini,  siyithabathe  le
Ndlu, siyise kanye phaya kubantu emakhaya.  Bendisiva  izolo  oku  kusithiwa
sisakhangelelwa  iimali  zokukhangela  ukuba  ngenene  singayenza  na   into
yokuphumeza  isigqibo  esisisingathiswe   yile   Ndlu,   yokuba   sithabathe
iPalamente siyise ebantwini.

Ndiyaphakamisa  ndicela,  njengelungu  le-ANC,  okokuba  mayifakwe  loo  nto
kuhlahlo lwabiwo-mali, kuba lo mbono  ukhoyo  kuMgaqo-siSeko  mawungabiyonto
ekhoyo nje kuphela, koko mawabelwe imali ukwenzela ukuba singathi xa  sifuna
ukuya ebantwini sihambe sicela, silindile.

Enye into endifuna ukuyibethelela, ngumba  ophathelele  kwiingxaki  esinazo.
Ngelishwa, xa  ndibhekisa  kumntakwethu  kweliya  cala  ubaw'  uDurr,  ndiva
kabuhlungu yinto yokuba oorhulumente abagqithileyo  esasingeyonxalenye  yabo
thina malungu e-ANC, babengenayo nakancinci into yokuzabela  imali  ii`Nodal
points'.  Akuzange  kubekho  mali  injengaleyo.  Uyakwazi  kodwa  ukhalazela
eyokuba  xa  abantu  begqiba  kusebenza  bafumane  iti  eshushu.   Mhlawumbi
kushiyana izithethe namasiko. Kufuneka sifundisane.

Singamalungu ePalamente, sinazo  iingxaki  ngokuphathelele  kwizithuthi.  Le
yeminye yemingeni esijongene nayo. Ininzi imali ekhutshwa zezi ziNdlu  ukuze
kubhatalwe ooduladula abasigodusayo, siye kuphumla, sisiya kufunda  emakhaya
kodwa iimeko zabo azide zilunge. Mayijongwe loo nto.

Kwakhona, sinalo eli khwele  lokuba  mninzi  umsebenzi  owenziwa  yile  Ndlu
ekuthi  ke  xa  sijongelwa  abantu  abanobuchwepheshe  ekuthiwa  ngabaphandi
sifumanise ukuba kungaba ngcono  xa  thina  kule  iNdlu  sineqela  leekomiti
singenakomiti enye. Mhlawumbi singaba nabo nokuba babini  abaphandi,  angabi
mnye kwiqela elinye. Ingasinceda loo nto xa inokwabelwa imali.  Siyalibulela
igalelo eselenziwe yile Ndlu kuba sezikho ezikhoyo, kambe azanelanga.

OoSomlomo kule Ndlu  kunye  nababhexeshi  bamaphondo  olithoba  basengxakini
kuba kwamanye amalungu babonakala,  mhlawumbi,  bengawenzi  umsebenzi  wabo.
Mazilungiswe eziya ofisi zijongene nezinto  zokuncedisana  namalungu.  Kukho
ikomitana  ekhoyo  ebuya  ize  kwenza  ingxelo  kwintlanganisela   yeekomiti
ezikhoyo. Kambe ubani ufumanisa ukuba asiphumli ngamalungu anengxaki  yokuba
abaphathi,  kweliya  candelo  leemfuno  zamalungu  ePalamente,   abawaphathi
kakuhle.  Ziyathatyathwa   izigqibo   ngeli   xesha   ikomiti   isaxoxa   ze
zisetyenziswe ngokungathi asikhokelwanga, asinazinkokeli  kule  Ndlu.  Sithi
siyayiphakamisa  loo  nto,   sisithi   mabahlukane   nokugqibela   iinkokeli
eziphethe kule Ndlu, kuba sizifumana singoosiputsu abangenzi nto.

Iindawo  zokuhlala  zikhona.  Ininzi  imali  ethi   ikhutshwe   ekubhataleni
netsalwayo, nokuba incinci kuthi malungu, kodwa  azicocekanga.  Ukuba  ngaba
ke kufanele  sithethe,  siyile  Ndlu,  sithi  nazo  maziqwalaselwe,  zabelwe
imali. Amanye amalungu akule Ndlu ayalibala ukuba  axhamla  ngaphambili.  Xa
ngoku kukho izibonelelo ezithi zenzeke  kunye  notshintsho  oluthi  lwenzeke
elizweni bayanxakama. Udade wethu  apha,  uNksz  Botha,  ubona  xa  kuzanywa
kuphakanyiswa  nento  esingekayigqibi,   esingekayixoxi   kule   Ndlu   sele
eyikhalazela.  Makuhanjwe  kuye  kusetyenzwa  ukwenzela   ukuba   sibagcine,
bangaweli  baye  kwamanye  amacala.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of  Xhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Ms B N DLULANE: Unfortunately, I find that  Madam  Speaker  and  the  Chief
Whip have mentioned many of the things I was going to talk about.

However, I am going to speak briefly about  challenges  with  which  we  are
faced. I fully support the two speakers who are also leaders of this  House,
the hon Chairperson, Mrs Naledi Pandor and the Chief Whip, Mr M E Surty.  If
they did not acknowledge the problems we are experiencing,  they  would  not
be leading us in this House.

I am saying this because I can see the kinds of  challenges  that  face  us.
Just yesterday we were talking about going  out  to  our  constituencies  in
Cape Town to consult with  people  and  take  this  House  directly  to  the
people. Yesterday I also heard that money was still being raised for  us  as
a way of making sure that we could deliver on the task that this  House  has
given us, that of taking this Parliament to the people.

I propose and, with due respect as a  member  of  the  ANC,  ask  that  this
undertaking be provided with a budget of its own,  because  this  vision  is
provided for in the Constitution and so it must be seen to be practised  and
not end on  paper.  This  would  mean  that  when  we  have  to  go  to  our
constituencies we do not first have to go around asking for money.

Another point I would like to emphasise relates to problems  that  we  have.
Unfortunately, when I refer to my brother Mr Durr over there,  I  feel  bad,
because the previous governments that we as the ANC  were  not  members  of,
did not set aside a budget for nodal  points.  There  were  no  such  funds.
Today he complains when people are served with tea when they  have  finished
working. Perhaps we differ in the manner in which we do  things.  We  should
perhaps teach one another.

We as members of Parliament do have problems with regard  to  transport.  We
are faced with a number of such challenges. A  lot  of  money  is  spent  on
paying the bus service that we use to take us home after work but  they  are
not in good condition. That must be looked at.

Furthermore, we would like that when we are afforded an opportunity to  work
with researchers, we should rather work as a cluster, comprised of a  number
of committees. Perhaps two researchers would be appropriate for one  cluster
at a time. This could help during the allocation of the budget.  We  welcome
the contribution made by this House in that regard, although there  are  not
enough researchers.

The chairperson of this House together with the whips of the nine  provinces
are in trouble because they are not seen to be effective by  other  members.
The offices that are meant to assist members should be put in  order.  There
is a committee that gives report to the forum which is made up  of  all  the
other committees. However, one finds that we are pressured  by  members  who
experience problems because the officials that are  supposed  to  attend  to
their problems do not  treat  them  well.  Decisions  are  taken  while  the
committee is sitting discussing issues and are then implemented as if we  do
not have leadership in this House.

We would like that that matter to be taken up, and we also say  they  should
stop the tendency of taking decisions  for  the  leadership  of  this  House
because it is as if we are useless  here  and  are  expected  to  carry  out
decisions of which we were not a part.

There is enough accommodation. There is money that is paid for  maintenance,
even if it is just a little, but they are not  clean.  If  we  have  to  say
anything about them as this House, then we say that they  should  be  looked
at, and a budget be set aside for them. Some  members  in  this  House  have
since forgotten that they  enjoyed  a  number  of  privileges  before.  When
services have to be provided for people and certain changes in  the  country
have to be implemented, they say a lot. My sister Mrs Botha has  a  tendency
of criticising and complaining everything that we try  to  propose  in  this
House. Some of the things we would not even have  proposed.  Let  people  go
and work hard so that we can keep them,  so  that  they  do  not  cross  the
political floor. [Applause.]]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson and hon members, the Budget  Vote  in  respect
of Parliament is supported by the IFP. I wish to look  at  the  subprogramme
Legislation and Oversight. This is the crux of what Parliament has to do.  A
key issue relates to the committee system. The  level  of  training  of  the
committee administrative clerks needs urgent attention.

The select committees of both Houses are the  engine  rooms  of  Parliament.
For the committees to function effectively, the administrative  clerks  have
to have good secretarial and language skills.  In-house  training,  followed
by yearly evaluation, would allow for adequate skills training. This  is  an
area that must receive attention.

Another area needing attention is that of oversight. The report  of  the  Ad
Hoc Subcommittee on Parliamentary Oversight  and  Accountability,  which  is
being finalised, recommends that a comprehensive guide be prepared  on  best
practices for this, because we need to implement  oversight.  On  behalf  of
the IFP I would like to recommend that funds be set aside for  a  manual  on
oversight to be developed as a matter of urgency.

This is also important also because by April 2003 all departments will  have
to be fully PFMA-compliant. If we  proceed  with  speed,  our  Chamber,  the
NCOP, and the provinces will be fully equipped for their respective roles.

The IFP is also concerned about the  financial  constraints  experienced  by
the NCOP-clustered committees. I  feel  that  this  has  been  mentioned  by
several speakers before me. The committees failed to expose their  committee
members to valuable study tours because of a shortage  of  funds.  Sometimes
only a few members are catered for, mainly  according  to  the  strength  of
their percentage vote. This deprives other members to a greater extent.  The
Parliament Budget Vote should adequately  cover  each  and  every  committee
within a cluster unit. The members' support structure is  a  bit  inadequate
when compared to that  of  our  foreign  counterparts,  as  in  other  well-
developed places, there is one member to three  support  staff  members.  To
work effectively, members must be well supported in this area.

In conclusion, we wish to give our support to the vote with  a  strong  plea
that we do everything necessary for the oversight function  to  be  properly
implemented. In this context we might need to re-examine  the  role  of  the
parliamentary research component. The  researchers  must  have  closer  ties
with  our  select  committees  so  that  they  can  follow  the   day-to-day
activities  and  have  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  real  issues.  The
researchers must work in closer co-operation with our committees.

After all, we operate under great pressure, and if, at any  time,  a  motion
study were to be undertaken, it would be clear that we as MPs need  all  the
support we can get to function effectively.

Siyawusekela kakhulu umfutho uSihlalo wale Ndlu u-N Pandor  asebenza  ngawo.
Udaba  lwasekhaya  lolu  futhi  sengikuchazile   okuningi   esibona   ukuthi

zokuqhuba umsebenzi,  imali  eyanele  yokwandisa  ulwazi  kumalungu  ekomiti
nokunye nokunye. Inkatha Freedom Party  iyaseseka  isabiwomali  sanamhlanje.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[We fully support the courage with which the Chairperson of this House,  Mrs
N Pandor, is working. This is a domestic issue and  I  have  explained  many
things that we think should be rectified. Enough assistants should  be  well
trained, and we should receive enough necessities to do  the  job.  We  also
need enough money to increase the number of members of  the  committees  and
so on.]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, there is a saying that  goes:  Zinamehlo  aziboni,
zineendlebe aziva. [They have eyes, they cannot see, they  have  ears,  they
cannot hear.]

The late Comrade Lenin had this to say: ``You can avoid criticism  by  being
nothing,  by  saying  nothing  and  by  doing  nothing.''   South   Africa's
Parliament continues to be a vibrant example of representative democracy  in
action. It has become the voice of inclusivity, of men and women,  of  young
and old, of the able-bodied and disabled, of people with special  needs,  of
the urban rich and the rural poor, of the straight and the gay.

It is largely due to the ANC's honest search for a  lasting  solution  which
could accommodate South Africa  in  its  diversity  that  we  today  have  a
Parliament that can really be described as a people's  parliament.  This  is
an achievement of which we are tremendously proud.

Another factor that has  made  it  possible  for  Parliament  to  become  an
effective instrument for participatory  democracy  is  the  quality  of  our
parliamentary leadership. Under their capable  stewardship,  Parliament  has
been able to maximise the annual budget  allocated  to  the  institution  by
broadening  public  participation,  creating  cost-effective   institutional
support structures and by  developing  more  effective  procedures  for  its
legislative and oversight functions.
The public participation programme of Parliament has been  very  successful.
Not a single day goes by without us encountering individuals or groups  from
marginalised communities visiting the  parliamentary  complex.  The  regular
interaction between Parliament and communities, which is facilitated by  the
public  participation  unit,   promotes   greater   public   awareness   and
understanding  of  democratic  practices  and  bodes  well  for  the  future
wellbeing of our democracy.

Parliament also has an effective electronic communications system in  place.
It has a well-developed Internet web page which contains useful  information
and provides an  opportunity  to  interested  people  and  organisations  to
follow issues that are before Parliament.

A  separate  Internet-based  information  management  system  called  ``NCOP
Online'' has been operational since 1999. It links the National  Council  of
Provinces to provincial legislatures and local government associations,  and
also makes the same information available to the general public.
The  research  capacity  for  members  has  also  been  improved  with   the
establishment of a new  library  and  information  services  unit.  The  new
research unit has increased the amount and quality  of  research  done,  and
this has enabled members to make a  more  qualitative  contribution  towards
the legislative process.

All the above activities were made possible through annual increases in  the
budget for institutional support. By  continuing  this  trend,  the  current
budget will enable Parliament to improve upon and even  increase  the  above
services.

With regard to the legislation and oversight  function  of  Parliament,  the
budget for these services has shown a significant increase  since  1997.  It
will grow at an average of 16% during the current and next  financial  year.
This steady increase is, amongst other things, justified by the increase  in
the range of languages used in Parliament.

The ANC believes  that  this  amount  will  enable  Parliament  to  continue
providing the support services required by the  institution  to  fulfil  its
constitutional  functions,   to   assist   political   parties   to   secure
administrative support and service their constituents, and  to  provide  MPs
with the necessary facilities.

I just want to highlight some aspects. The first point is  that  members  of
the NCOP, especially at the level of the budget  committee,  do  not  attend
sittings of that committee. The second point is that  the  budget  committee
intends doing  the  following:  Firstly,  to  raise  sharply  and  create  a
mechanism that seeks to  evaluate  the  work  of  committees;  secondly,  to
effectively check the effectiveness of our own oversight work;  thirdly,  to
check the impact of our work on the lives of our people so  that  committees
are able to justify their budgets. The ANC supports the budget. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, I think we must begin by  thanking
hon members who have assisted in steering the House today - thank  you  very
much to all of you. [Applause.]

We have the difficulty again of the work that various members of  Parliament
have to do. As members would be aware, we have a delegation  at  the  moment
that is attending the meeting of the  African  and  Arab  Senates  Forum  in
Morocco, led by the Deputy Chairperson, hence his absence here.

In addition, Ms Ntlabati who is a member, as I  indicated  earlier,  of  the
SADC Parliamentary Forum executive  chairs  the  gender  committee  on  that
body's set of committees. She is attending  a  workshop  and  conference  on
gender associated with the SADC Parliamentary Forum, hence her  absence.  So
I thank the hon members who have assisted us today.

My thanks as well to all the members who  have  spoken  in  this  debate.  I
should have said right at the beginning that, for  the  past  year  and  the
financial year we are considering, our most heartfelt thanks  should  go  to
each and every permanent delegate as well as  special  delegates  that  have
participated in the NCOP for their contribution and sterling work.  I  think
we have really had quite amazing contributions from members of the  National
Council,  from  special  delegates  and  from  members  of  Salga   -   more
particularly in 2001 and rather less in 2002, which  is  something  we  must
address  because  we  are  not  seeing  the   kind   of   local   government
participation that we should have.

I should also thank the Whips for the contribution that they  have  made  to
the House and the progress of work in the House, particularly Mr Surty,  the
Chief Whip of the National Council, in the leadership with  respect  to  the
programme and focus of the institution. I thank him very  much.  I  know  we
tend to keep him in Cape Town, because of  the  Chief  Whip's  role,  rather
than having opportunities presented to him to be out of the country  playing
different roles, but, as they say, his time will probably come.

I would also like then to thank the chairpersons of the  select  committees.
All of us are aware that the chairpersons  have  been  working  really  hard
steering our committees, particularly this year. In the next few weeks,  the
load of legislation, especially with respect to section 75  legislation,  is
going to increase substantially, and I am sure our committees are  going  to
be hard pressed to meet the massive agenda, but I know they are well  up  to
the task and we thank each and every chairperson of a select  committee  for
the role that he or  she  has  played.  I  am  deeply  appreciative  of  the
commitment of members of the National Council  to  their  very  onerous  and
complex roles.

I know the  institution  is  not  an  easy  one.  We  are  misunderstood  by
everybody including the media. I always  watch  with  great  amusement  when
they refer to Parliament and they are  talking  of  one  House,  or  to  the
Speaker of Parliament. I even heard this morning, for example, a  member  of
the media on the television news making reference  to  the  Speaker  of  the
British parliament, when there is no such office. This  unidirectional  view
of parliamentary institutions is a rather peculiar  feature  of  our  media.
Perhaps we need to look at some engagement there to begin to adjust our  own
views and perspectives.

A number of points have been raised which I think  I  will  briefly  comment
upon. Perhaps one of them should be that we wish we could hear  more  of  Mr
Ackermann, because we do need to inject some humour and lightness  into  the
House. I think we tend to be rather too serious. I know  we  are  a  serious
House, but now and again some humour  and  bright  faces  are  necessary.  I
would encourage members to relax from time to time.

The matter of the allocation  of  resources  to  committees  has  been  made
reference to by several members. It is important to say that our  committees
have often received allocations that have been a  thumbsuck  rather  than  a
reflection of the programme of committees, and the reason is  that  we  have
not been good as committees at presenting budgets linked to  our  plans.  We
have to make this honest admission ourselves  as  committees,  but  I  agree
certainly that our resources are inadequate and we are addressing this  very
directly. We hold the view, in looking at the budget  for  committees,  that
we need to be able to provide sufficient support, but also  ensure  that  we
address the differences that exist amongst the committees.

I think all  of  us  know  that  there  are  certain  committees  which  are
clustered  in  the  NCOP,  and  therefore  we  have  many  committees,  some
committees with large loads and those with less of a load. We  have  got  to
be able, in allocating the resources, to distinguish these  differences  and
make sure we provide for the different workloads  that  committees  have  to
confront. Some committees have to have more hearings  and  more  interaction
at the provincial level because they have  larger  loads  in  terms  of  the
legislation that they have to deal with. But  certainly  I  agree  with  hon
members that we must address the manner in which resources are  provided  to
committees.

I am concerned about the way in which we sometimes plan our  work.  We  have
said that we need our committees to set out a clear annual programme, and  I
think from this year we have begun to do that. But I still believe that  the
plans are sometimes unrealistic. I recall that last year the Speaker  and  I
were looking at some of the submissions that we had received and we had  one
committee whose submission indicated  a  particular  amount  for  visits  to
provinces. When we looked at it and turned out the sums behind the  millions
that were being asked for, it turned out  that  that  committee  would  have
visited each of the nine provinces six times in this year, and,  of  course,
that is absolutely  impossible.  So  it  is  pie-in-the-sky  planning  of  a
budget. I think we need to be far more realistic and far more  directed  and
careful about  our  planning,  so  that  we  can,  when  we  receive  budget
proposals, see that those proposals are linked to a  realistic  agenda.  But
it is an aspect that we are going to address and respond to effectively.

I also think we need to interact with local government far more than we  are
doing. The initiative that was led primarily by the Chief Whip in  the  last
week of the provincial visits is a very important one.  We  have  talked  in
the last year about the important  legislation  that  we  have  passed  with
respect to local government, the new systems  legislation  that  we  passed,
and I wonder to what degree we are examining practice with respect  to  that
legislation. I think what we need to do is to take the  legislation  in  our
hands and go to each of the 284 municipalities  and  begin  to  assess  how,
with each of the aspects of this  new  legislation,  they  are  progressing.
Then we must come back here  and  report  in  full  a  proper  way,  as  the
different provinces, on each aspect of that particular legislation  so  that
we can assess whether the  agenda  we  have  set  for  local  government  is
realisable or whether there is something more we should be doing  to  assist
local government to succeed. I am worried that we are not taking  a  careful
look. I believe we have set local government a  very  tough  agenda  and  we
have to ensure that we support  local  government  in  realising  the  large
mandate we have given them.

Mr Durr, of course, as a member with a high level  of  moral  consciousness,
has made a very important point with respect to this matter of lobbying  and
seeking favour from political representatives. I think it is something  that
really  relies  largely  upon  the  mechanisms  we  put  in  place  here  in
Parliament and our own adherence to them. We have  taken  major  steps  with
respect to that. We have the register of interests and we  are  looking  now
at a code of ethics. I am interested that members are taking  very  long  in
finalising it and I wonder why, but certainly we are  supposed  to  finalise
the code of ethics.

We are all supposed to be  registering  entertainment  in  the  register  of
members' interests. We need, each time we  receive  hospitality,  to  record
the form of support and hospitality that we are receiving. I think  Mr  Durr
is absolutely correct that we need to  question  the  pattern  of  behaviour
that we are beginning to  exemplify  as  public  representatives.  Is  it  a
positive pattern of behaviour? Do we find ourselves, as the leadership of  a
nation that has called  for  moral  regeneration,  reflecting  the  kind  of
demand that we are putting to our society?

If we fall short, then clearly there is a problem. If,  in  our  reflection,
we find we are up to the standard we are setting, then  we  are  doing  very
well. It is primarily a matter of conscience. I am not sure it is  something
we can ourselves direct, apart from the instruments that we  put  in  place,
but it is an aspect that we must increasingly monitor and  ensure  we  guide
action on.

With respect to the views that have been expressed on the  security  system,
I am aware that we are trying to ensure that this system  provides  security
to members, particularly as we  are  within  the  precincts  of  Parliament.
However, that system is not part  of  the  finances  of  Parliament;  it  is
provided through the finances of the Department of Public Works,  hence  the
lack of reference on our part to it. We are  monitoring  the  implementation
and effectiveness of the  system  and,  through  the  internal  arrangements
committee and the Joint Rules Committee, I think we  certainly  must  assess
whether it provides the kind of protection that we would want.

I do not think any responsible parliamentarian would say we do  not  require
security, given recent events in parliaments in other parts  of  the  world,
where we have seen people coming into parliament  shooting.  Perhaps  it  is
because they shot presiding officers that people are  not  worried,  but  in
fact there have been breaches of security in parliaments. Therefore we  need
to ensure that we have a good security system in place. What  I  would  want
to assess through our monitoring would be whether we have an  effective  way
of ensuring that we do adhere to the security objectives that  we  have  set
out and that we are providing maximum support and protection to members.

The matter that was raised by Ms Botha with respect to  the  Marks  Building
entrance was drawn to my attention recently and we are  looking  at  it.  In
fact, I believe it is on the agenda for the next  meeting  of  the  internal
arrangements committee.  It  is  something  that  we  must  resolve.  It  is
absolutely unacceptable that members with disabilities  who  wish  to  enter
that building find that they are not easily able to do so, and we  certainly
must address  this.  I  believe  it  is  an  oversight  which  is  extremely
worrying.

On the matter of cleanliness, members would be aware that in  fact  we  have
asked the internal arrangements committee to look  at  this  aspect  of  our
Parliament. Of course we are the ones who throw paper down outside,  and  we
are the ones who may not be keeping the setting as clean as it should be.  I
really  think  we  have  to  address  whether  we  assist   in   maintaining
cleanliness while we also ask the staff  and  management  of  Parliament  to
ensure that the place is kept as clean as possible.  We  are  engaging  with
the Department of Public Works  on  the  maintenance  of  the  parliamentary
infrastructure in its totality, and hopefully they will be providing a  more
dedicated service to us to ensure that we keep up the  assets  and  property
of this institution.

I believe that we do have to  address  the  matter  of  time  allocated  for
visits to provinces, but, as I have said previously,  each  provincial  week
must have a purpose. We are not just going to go  to  provinces  and  wander
around without a clear programme and agenda. If there  is  a  clear  set  of
work that we wish to do that is distinct from a legislative agenda  that  we
have, then I think that we can put that to the Programme  Committee  and  we
can programme both the approach and the work, so  that  every  member  knows
exactly what role they have to play within the provinces.

On the matter of the role of the National Council of Provinces,  I  have  to
say that I do agree with the hon Matthee that in  fact  the  matter  of  co-
operative governance is an important principle that must be observed if  our
democracy is to work. There are some  who  believe  that  in  fact  one  can
proceed with a single parliament, and no other  institution  of  legislative
democracy throughout the country. I do not support such a view,  because  if
one concentrates power in one institution,  the  likelihood  of  a  lack  of
representativity occurring is real, and that can be a massive problem for  a
country.

I believe our Constitution-writers were  in  fact  correct  in  seeking  the
institutional promotion of co-operation, and it is something  that  we  must
keep in place and ensure that we make work. That means that we as  the  NCOP
have to meet our obligation extremely accurately,  because  if  we  are  the
glue that holds the institutions together, we have to  play  our  role  with
maximum effectiveness to ensure that indeed, in  every  sphere,  our  people
believe and feel the representation. That is the challenge that we face.  We
cannot adhere to the principle of co-operation without it being  felt  as  a
living entity where our people are based. Therefore I think it is  something
we support, but we must pursue it with greater determination and planning.

I did not make reference to the refurbishment of our Chamber, again  because
it does not fall essentially within our budget; it  is  something  that  the
Department of Public Works is primarily providing for. Members will be  very
pleased to learn that the refurbishment is proceeding  well.  I  think  they
may like the look of the Chamber as it is beginning to emerge. We do have  a
very high level of technology being provided for us within the  Chamber.  We
have received the specifications of the coats of arms of eight  out  of  the
nine provinces - we await the KwaZulu-Natal coat of arms, but  the  rest  we
have received - and they will be going up on the walls in the NCOP. We  hope
that when we return in August we will be returning to our  Chamber,  and  we
will not have to utilise a space where we are strangers. [Applause.]

I also support those members who have expressed the view  that  we  need  to
more directly examine whether indeed we are reflecting provincial  interests
in our deliberations. I hope that in the debates we are going to  be  having
on the various Budget Votes in the next three weeks we will begin to  get  a
sense of how we are utilising resources from the national fiscus in each  of
the provinces and the nature of the impact and gap that exists with  respect
to national policy and support at the provincial level.

I do think we do not yet sufficiently hear  about  provincial  interests  in
the  NCOP.  I  often  ask  myself,  as  I  listen  to  the   debates,   what
distinguishes our contribution from the  contributions  being  made  in  the
National Assembly on the different Budget Votes. Of course one can hear  our
contributions, but in what way  do  they  reflect  provincial  interests?  I
think we need to take a much more careful look at  our  national  impact  on
provincial practice and policy, in order to really  assess  whether  we  are
carrying out the role that we should be playing.

Proactive contributions by provinces would be  welcome.  We  certainly  have
been assisting provinces in terms of public hearings and in terms  of  their
consideration of national legislation. In fact, I recall an article  by  the
Speaker of the Gauteng province, who very honestly admitted that 80% of  the
work of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature, if I am not wrong,  arises  from
the NCOP's mandate and work that we bring to the legislature.

Clearly we may even want to ask what the  provinces,  as  legislatures,  are
doing in terms of the assignment that they enjoy, with respect  to  Schedule
4 and the other schedules in the Constitution.  Are  we  seeing  regulations
being  produced?  Are  we  seeing  any  policy  emerging  on  the   national
concurrent competencies? What form of legislative activity is taking  place?
How much are  provincial  legislatures  actually  meeting?  Are  they  doing
sufficient oversight work? With respect to oversight, let us  remember  that
the responsibility  primarily  resides  within  the  provinces  and  is  not
necessarily assigned to us. We reflect the  provincial  interest,  but  they
must assist us by carrying out a full oversight function at  the  provincial
level. We need to look at whether this is happening and  whether  it  really
assists the NCOP.

The matter of the state of the nation address is an interesting one,  and  I
am not sure how it is to be answered. I do  not  know  whether  we  want  to
participate in the debate. I feel that would be  a  regression,  because  we
would perhaps be repeating what happened with the Senate, etc. What I  think
we should look at is whether it is possible for us to utilise the  state  of
the nation address as a full preparation for the review of the  nation  that
occurs in the National Council of  Provinces.  For  each  of  the  areas  of
action that emanate from the state of the nation address  at  the  beginning
of every year, can we track implementation and performance? When  we  review
at the end of the year, are we able to see what progress has been made?

That may be an assignment that the National Council of  Provinces  wants  to
look at, but I really would be wary of our having  a  duplication  in  place
and wanting to participate in a debate just for the sake of debate. I  would
rather like us to examine far more carefully how we may  utilise  the  state
of the nation address to enhance the work of the NCOP. Maybe  we  would  ask
Mr Matthee to give consideration to that and then we  could  come  back  and
look at it. I am not  sure  whether  participating  in  the  debate  is  the
answer. There may be other activities and responses that  we  could  devise,
and I believe we should spend some time thinking about that.

On the project of Parliament to the People, this is an  exciting  initiative
that we are trying to set about and again it is something that we will  need
to budget for in future. I hope we will  successfully  implement  the  pilot
that we have set in place for this year, which will  see  us  proceeding  to
the Eastern Cape province to engage with the people on Parliament:  What  is
parliament? What is the role that Parliament can play in enhancing the  life
of the people? We should mix that, as  the  Whips  agreed  this  week,  with
legislative work in the province on legislation  that  we  will  be  dealing
with at  that  time,  at  the  beginning  of  August.  It  is  an  important
initiative and one that we certainly would want to make a part of the NCOP.

With respect to Ms Dlulane's concern about transport, I am  aware  that  the
matter of transport has been a source of  concern  among  members  for  some
time. Unfortunately, the transport service provided  is  contracted  to  the
Department of Public Works. I think we  need  to  examine  why  so  many  of
Parliament's Services reside with Public Works and whether they  should  not
reside  directly  within  Parliament.   However,   within   Parliament   our
management  has  decided  to  provide  a  facility  so  that   members   can
communicate any concerns and problems, which  can  then  be  raised  by  the
parliamentary staff with the Department of Public Works. I am  sure  members
can get information as to the staff member  dealing  with  this  matter  and
where the person is located so that they  could  engage  with  them  on  the
transport problems that members are facing.

Mrs Vilakazi made an important contribution about the need  to  ensure  that
the staff assigned to committees are fully trained and supported to be  able
to effectively support our committees.

I was quite amazed last week when I was approached by  a  person  who  is  a
manager supporting research for a committee on finance in  the  lower  House
in the Parliament of Germany. After we had  had  a  brief  conversation  she
handed me her card and I noted that she had a Phd.  That  is  the  level  of
committee support that they provide. Perhaps we need to ensure  that  we  do
provide support to our staff, but we also need to ask  whether  a  clerk  is
sufficient and whether we should not  be  looking  for  a  higher  level  of
training background  in  order  to  get  the  kind  of  staff  support  that
committees believe they require.

On the matter of oversight, as I have said, I  believe  that  the  oversight
role is there for the National Council  of  Provinces,  but  it  resides  in
partnership with the provincial legislatures. We need  to  look  at  how  we
work to review implementation so  that  we  are  able  to  exercise  a  full
oversight role. The landscape study book that Mrs Vilakazi  and  Mr  Matthee
referred to provides some guidelines on what the role of the NCOP  would  be
with respect to oversight. We need to look at that and  at  whether  we  are
carrying out those sets of  mandates.  Each  of  our  committees  should  be
examining whether they are indeed carrying out their oversight obligation.

On the matter of study tours, that is entirely a decision of committees,  as
presiding officers do not play  a  role  in  committee  decisions  on  study
tours, but certainly on the matter of finances two committees  would  be  an
aspect that has to be addressed as we look at it. Regarding Mr  Raju's  view
that the chairpersons always travel, I do not know about that, but  that  is
something that the committee must address.

In conclusion, I would like to mention two areas in which I believe we  need
urgent responses from members of Parliament. The first area is that  of  the
symbol of Parliament. We have been trying for two and a half  years  to  get
new symbols that are in line with the democracy  we  achieved  in  1994.  We
asked the public to make submissions and the public did. We asked the  State
Herald to assist us in putting forward  suggestions  as  to  the  nature  of
symbols suggested by the public submissions. The State Herald did that.  The
Joint Rules Committee  then  referred  the  material  that  we  received  to
political parties. We have been  waiting  to  hear  from  political  parties
their final views on the symbols so that, after eight  years,  we  can  have
new symbols of Parliament.

I would ask political parties to act on this matter so that at  last,  after
eight years, we do have new symbols. It would be terrible if we all  retired
from Parliament in 2004 and left the new Parliament  then  to  proceed  with
the whole process of once more trying to get new symbols in place. The  lack
of responsiveness by political parties and the lack of submissions are  very
worrying. I think we all have to act more  speedily,  especially  the  large
party, the majority party, to ensure that these processes do move.

The second area where there is a gap, in my view, is that  of  the  language
policy for Parliament.

Ke a swaba ga ke reetsa fa re bua mo ntlung ye. Ke bone gore ga re buwe  puo
tsa rona, ke a ipotsa gore ke eng  re  sa  buwe  puo  tsa  rona.  [I  become
disappointed when listening to the debates in this House.  I  have  realised
that we do not speak our languages and I do not know why we do  not  address
the House in our languages.] Kutheni  singathethi  iilwimi  zethu,  sithetha
iSingesi qha? [Why are we not speaking our languages, but English only?]
I am asking why it is - for the benefit of hon  members  who  do  not  speak
Setswana or isiXhosa - that we do  not  use  the  other  languages  of  this
country.  We  have  11  official  languages  that  are  recognised  in   our
Constitution, and represented in this room are  persons  each  of  whom  can
speak at least two of those 11 languages, and yet 89% of the time  we  speak
English. I think this is unacceptable. [Applause.] It does not  reflect  the
multilingualism that we have committed ourselves to.

I believe we should ask ourselves what form of policy we need to  have  with
respect to language in our Parliament and  what  steps  we  should  take  to
improve our use of a multilingual approach in  our  debates.  I  thought  Ms
Nkuna in the debate on media diversity would speak today,  would  speak  the
diverse languages that she can  use  so  well.  Of  course,  I  always  look
forward to Reverend Moatshe's wonderful expressions and idioms  in  Setwana.
Bagaetsho re tla dirisa puo tsa rona re buwe setswana. [I hope that we  will
use our languages, and speak Setswana.]
Sithetha isiXhosa. [We speak Xhosa.] sikhulume  isiZulu.  [We  speak  Zulu.]
Izizwe zonke zisive  xa  sithetha,  abantu  bethu  nabo  bavume  ukuba  nabo
bakhona kula Palamente. [All nations should understand us when we speak  and
our  people  too  should  then  agree  that  they  are  indeed  present   in
Parliament.] If our people can hear us speaking each  of  the  languages  of
our country, they will at least say ``I am present in that House.''

Ke teng moo ntlung yeo, le nna ke a utlwagala. [Legofi.] [I  am  present  in
that House. My voice is heard.] [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 17:13.

     First Report of the Working Group on the African Union


     A.     Introduction


     The Working Group was established on 16 November 2001 by  a  resolution
     of the National Council of Provinces. The primary focus of the  Working
     Group was to consider the implementation of the Constitutive Act of the
     African Union


     B.     Composition of the Working Group


     The following Members were appointed to the Working Group:


     Ms G N M Pandor (Chairperson)


     Mr M L Mushwana


     Mr M E Surty


     Mr M A Sulliman


     Ms J N Vilakazi


     Ms C-S Botha


     Mr P A Matthee


     C.     Objectives of the Working Group


     The brief of the Working Group is to:


         *  Consider Parliament's participation  in  the  implementation  of
              the  Constitutive  Act  of  the  African  Union  and   suggest
              appropriate procedural mechanisms for this.


         *  Determine the involvement of Parliament in assisting  the  South
              African Government in the process  of  implementation  of  the
              African Union.


     D.     Meetings of the Working Group


     The working group  met  on  19  February  2002  and  on  3  June  2002.
     Individual Members of the Working Group also attended meetings  of  the
     National Assembly Working Group on the African Union, as  well  as  the
     two seminars on the African Union that were held at Parliament.


     E.     Recommendations


     The  working  group   considered   the   following   instruments:   The
     Constitutive Act of  AU;  the  protocol  establishing  the  Pan-African
     Parliament, the protocol establishing the African Court of Justice  and
     the South African Constitution. The comments below arise from  comments
     and discussions within the working group.


     These instruments were analysed against the established  principles  of
     Public International law. They were weighed against the  South  African
     Constitution as dictated to by section 234, which stipulates:


         In order to deepen the culture  of  democracy  established  by  the
         Constitution, Parliament may adopt Charters  of  Rights  consistent
         with the provisions of the Constitution.
     Section 233:


         When interpreting any legislation,  every  court  must  prefer  any
         reasonable interpretation of the  legislation  that  is  consistent
         with international law to any alternative  interpretation  that  is
         inconsistent with international law.


     And lastly section 232, which provides:


         Customary international law is law in the  Republic  unless  it  is
         inconsistent with the Constitution or an Act of Parliament.


     For comparison the UN Charter and the Statute  of  International  Court
     were also analysed.


     In the case of the PAP and the African Court of Justice, perhaps  there
     may still be an opportunity to raise the issues  if  our  comments  are
     found valid and reservations may still be entered  (registered)  during
     the time of signing, in the event that the  points  can  no  longer  be
     canvassed with other countries or blocs with which South Africa  has  a
     good relationship.


     I.     Constitutive Act of the AU:


     * The language of the Act is not gender sensitive/gender neutral  (e.g.
           references to Chairman)


     * The Report of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs highlighted the
           following:


           *     Possible contradictions  between  provisions  in  the  Act
              (e.g. provisions regarding accelerating political  and  socio-
              economic integration, provisions relating to a common  defence
              policy; provisions relating to right of intervention in member
              States


           *     Possible infringement of sovereignty of States
     We recognise the significance of the Constitutive Act being adopted  by
     the Heads of State and the framework which it sets in place. But having
     regard to the developments that have already occurred on the  continent
     between countries and within regions, it is important for the following
     to be noted:


     * The Act makes reference to accelerating political and  socio-economic
         integration.  Questions  arise  as  to  what  will  happen  to  the
         existing agreements that South Africa has entered into.  Are  these
         going to fall away? How are they going to be part of  the  existing
         framework? Parliament  may  need  to  assist  in  this  process  by
         examining the existing agreements and  by  recommending  areas  for
         review  or  further  action.  Consideration  should  be  given   to
         providing resources for Parliament to conduct such a review.


     * The Act makes reference to a common defence policy without giving any
         guidance  as  to  what  this  may  mean.   Furthermore,   important
         principles that have informed  South  Africa's  current  policy  on
         defence matters, such as the promotion of peace, the  encouragement
         of  conflict  resolution,  and  so  forth,  are   not   highlighted
         sufficiently.


     * There seems to be a possibility of overlapping of the powers  of  the
         Assembly with those of the Executive  Council.  These  need  to  be
         unravelled as this might lead to duplication.


     * The provision dealing with the appointment  of  the  judiciary  needs
         tightening up as at the end there is a random picking of  those  to
         retire first: Is it not possible to tie these to  some  competence,
         if only to maintain a balance between the need for rotation on  one
         side and building of retention and transfer of  skills  within  the
         judiciary on the other. The matter of removal from office  will  be
         dealt with when dealing with the African Court of Justice (ACJ).


     II.     Protocol  to  the  Treaty  Establishing  the  African  Economic
           Community relating to the Pan-African Parliament


     *  Article  5(4)(d):  The   definition   of   what   would   constitute
           ``misconduct''  should  be  clearly  defined  in  the  Rules  of
           Procedure of the PAP as the rules  of  debate  of  some  African
           countries reflect basically four different  systems  in  Africa,
           viz French, Westminster, Arabic, Constitutionalism (RSA).


     * Article 6: Voting. We believe that  at  least  for  the  period  when
           membership of  the  PAP  is  based  on  the  membership  of  the
           Parliaments of the Member States, the Members  are  representing
           their legislatures and therefore should be voting by  way  of  a
           mandate  received  from   their   legislatures,   and   not   as
           individuals. When the PAP has developed to  such  a  stage  that
           Members campaign themselves for seats in the PAP then they  vote
           as they please.


     * Article 8: Immunities. We believe that a comparison should be made of
           the immunities, which members of the SA  Parliament  receive  as
           opposed to the immunities which members  of  the  PAP  have.  SA
           Parliament to be aware of any ``clashes'' -  particularly  since
           the immunities could be very broad and far-reaching.


     Immunities should as far as possible be  linked  to  the  discharge  of
     duties as a member of the PAP.


     * Article 10: Allowances.


         The understanding of the South African Parliament has  always  been
         that the  individual  Parliaments  would  be  responsible  for  the
         salaries of their Members  to  the  Pan-African  Parliament  (PAP).
         These persons would be full Members of that  Parliament  and  would
         therefore receive that salary. In terms of  allowances,  the  issue
         that would have to be  looked  at  would  be  the  subsistence  and
         travel allowances (S&T). It is that component that  would  have  to
         be incorporated in the budgeting.


         It therefore means that the governments on the  continent  must  be
         aware that in budgeting for 2003 and beyond, they  have  to  ensure
         that in their budgets they include  provision  for  allowances  and
         travel of  the  Members  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament.  (It  is
         anticipated that the first sitting of  the  Pan-African  Parliament
         will take place in 2003).


         Consideration should also be given to the question of what  support
         the individual Parliaments would have to provide to  their  Members
         of the PAP.
     * Article 12(5): We would suggest that the President and the four  Vice
         Presidents be accountable for the management and administration  of
         the PAP, but that the Clerk and Deputy Clerks  be  responsible  for
         the management and administration of PAP. This  position  links  up
         with the comments  that  we  have  previously  made  regarding  the
         continuity of  membership  of  the  PAP.  It  is  likely  that  the
         President and other Officers will not have the  continuity  in  the
         same way as the Clerk and Deputies have. The  latter  will  be  the
         institutional memory of the PAP, and therefore  it  would  be  more
         appropriate  if  they  were  responsible  for  administration   and
         management of the PAP.


     * It is envisaged that the PAP will ultimately  have  full  legislative
         functions. The question is should the  PAP's  legislative  function
         be limited to setting norms and standards that  domestic  law  must
         incorporate, or should the PAP  have  full  legislative  powers  so
         that it produces law that each of the Member States  have  to  base
         their practice upon?


     * It would be important that a basic set of principles and  rights  are
         agreed upon in order to reduce the potential for  conflict  in  the
         area of Human Rights law. We need to give recognition to  the  fact
         that Charters on Human Rights already exist on  the  continent,  as
         formulated by the Organisation of African Unity.


       It would be vital that the African Union and the PAP, in  particular,
         examine those Charters in order to look at whether they  are  still
         appropriate in regard to current conditions, or whether there is  a
         need to review and amend those instruments.


     III.   African Charter on Human and People's Rights - African Court  on
           Human and People's Rights


           The preamble to this protocol provides:


           ``Firmly convinced that the attainment of the objectives of  the
           African Charter  on  Human  and  People's  Rights  requires  the
           establishment  of  an  African  Court  on  Human  and   People's
           Commission to complement and  reinforce  the  functions  of  the
           African Commission on Human and People's Rights.''


           Article 6 on Admissibility of Cases provides:


              (3) The Court may consider  cases  or  transfer  them  to  the
              Commission.


         Article 8, meanwhile, provides:


         The Rules of Procedure of the Court shall  lay  down  the  detailed
         conditions under which  the  Court  shall  consider  cases  brought
         before  it,  bearing  in  mind  the  complementarity  between   the
         Commission and the Court.


         *  The roles of the Court and the Commission have to  be  clarified
              in  quite  a  distinct  way  so  that  we  see  how  they  are
              distinguished  from  each  other,  then  we  can  accept   the
              complementarity between the two.  We  accept  that  they  must
              liaise because the basis of appeal to the Court would  be  the
              infringement of rights.


         The Constitutive Act in Article 26 provides:


         Interpretation


         The Court shall be seized with  matter  of  interpretation  arising
         from the application or implementation of this Act ...


         Article 6(3) of the Protocol on the Court and  article  26  of  the
         Constitutive Act need to be reconciled. Under normal  circumstances
         courts are usually the last ports of  arbiter.  Article  4  of  the
         Protocol on the Court provides powers to the Court  to  provide  an
         opinion on any legal matter relating to the Charter  or  any  other
         relevant human right instruments but excludes  any  subject  matter
         being examined by the Commission.


         It is unusual for an arrangement in which a court would consider  a
         case or transfer it to a commission.


         *  We believe that the Court must have the power to  determine  the
              outcome.


         Article 10 of the Protocol of the Court  provides  for  free  legal
         representation where the interests of justice  so  require.  It  is
         accepted that this provision may be there to  ensure  accessibility
         of justice to all. However, it would seem that the wording is  such
         that it is open to abuse as there are  not  stipulations  regarding
         conditions for qualification for free legal representation.


         *  We would propose the inclusion  of  a  conditionality,  such  as
              ``free legal representation where the interests of justice and
              administration so require, as determined by  the  Assembly  or
              the Pan-African Parliament in legislation.''


         *  Article 15 regulates the  term  of  office  of  judges.  Article
              15(2) might need to be tidied up, as it  is  too  informal  to
              such an institution.  The  comments  raised  above  under  the
              Constitutive Act article regulating this are applicable here.


         *  Article 17(3) grants judges of the Court immunities extended  to
              diplomatic  agents  in  accordance  with  international   law.
              Article 17(3) and its full implications have to be examined as
              it raises a set of complex problems with  respect  to  natural
              justice.


         *  Article 17(4) provides:


                  At no time shall the judges of the Court  be  held  liable
                  for any decision or opinion  issued  in  the  exercise  of
                  their function.


            The formulation of article 17(4) needs to be carefully  reviewed
              because the level of licence that  it  grants  appears  to  be
              excessive and does not link to any known standards. It is  far
              too wide and needs to include certain checks and balances.


         *  Article 19(1) provides for cessation of office. This article  is
              also intended to reinforce the independence of the  judiciary.
              Consideration should be given to the need to ensure  that  due
              process is available to judges in such instances.


            It may also be useful to consider providing for members  of  the
              judiciary to approach the Assembly in cases  where  they  hold
              the view that their rights have been infringed.


     IV.    African Charter on Human and People's  Rights  -  Commission  on
           Human and Peoples' Rights


     * Article 41 of the  Charter  provides  for  the  appointments  to  the
           Commission. It would be important to look at the process with  a
           view   to   identifying   how   greater   transparency,   public
           participation and  the  involvement  of  civil  society  can  be
           introduced into the process.


     F.     Conclusion


     The Working Group had seen this initial process as an  interim  process
     preparing the initial thinking of the two Houses, and  would  therefore
     recommend that, subject to the concurrence of the National Assembly,  a
     joint working committee on the African Union be established.


     Report to be considered.

2.    Report of the Select Committee on Labour  and  Public  Enterprises  on

         Centre and the Department of Home Affairs in Gauteng on 24  and  25
         May 2001. The aim of the visit was to -


         *  critically assess  the  living  conditions  at  the  Centre,  to
              investigate allegations in the media about human rights abuses
              at the Centre, and to see in which  way  the  Committee  could
              intervene to address problem areas; and
         *  ascertain progress made with the new  system  of  the  ID  smart
              card at the Department.
         The delegation, under  the  leadership  of  Ms  L  Jacobus  (ANC  -
         Gauteng), included -


         *  Ms N S Ntlabati (ANC - Free State);


         *  Mrs E C Gouws (DP - Eastern Cape);


         *  Mr T H Sogoni (UDM - Eastern Cape); and


         *  Mr J Horne (New NP - Northern Cape).


         Ms M Mukhuba, Committee Secretary, accompanied the delegation.


     Lindela Repatriation Centre


     B.     Background


         The Lindela Repatriation Centre was established in 1996. It is  the
         only  centre  of  its  kind  in  the  country.  There  has  been  a
         continuous outcry in the media about the treatment  of  inmates  at
         the Centre. A number of instances of abuse, including physical  and
         mental abuse of inmates, had been  reported.  It  is  also  alleged
         that inmates' human rights were being violated and that the  living
         conditions were appalling. Illegal activities  allegedly  committed
         by staff, such  as  the  tearing  up  of  legal  papers  and  other
         documents, had also been leveled  against  officials  who  ran  the
         centre.


         The visit included a meeting with management and staff as  well  as
         a tour of the facility.


     C.     Findings


         1. Overview by Mr J L van Vuuren, Project  Leader/Deputy  Director:
              Home Affairs
              The Centre is a place where illegal immigrants are kept  prior
              to deportation to their countries of origin. Within 72  hours,
              the Centre's officials should be able to classify  from  which
              country an immigrant comes.  The  official's  only  source  of
              information is the arrestee himself or herself. It  is  common
              for   arrestees   to   provide   officials   with   inaccurate
              information, because they fear deportation. The information is
              sent to the relevant Embassy or High Commission as well as  to
              the Department of Home Affairs. Once this has been  done,  the
              official prepares the  repatriation  documents  to  facilitate
              deportation.


              The Centre functions with four computers, three cameras, three
              fingerprint scanners and an identification card reader,  which
              are integrated  into  a  database.  The  database  information
              includes -
              *   Name and surname;


              *  Date of birth;
              *   Photo capturing on an individual basis;


              *   Fingerprint identification;


              *   Date and place of arrest;


              *   Date of admission;


              *   Date of release; and


              *   Country of origin.


              The information is then  stored  on  the  identification  card
              given to the inmate on admittance. Upon release, this card  is
              scanned into a separate computer and the inmate's fingerprints
              are read on the scanner again. The identification card is kept
              on file at the Centre for administration purposes.
              Up to 4 000 people can be accommodated at the Centre. About  1
              500 people are deported every month. The South African  Police
              Service brings about 90% of the immigrants to the Centre  from
              various police stations, mostly from ones in Gauteng. However,
              immigrants are also brought  from  police  stations  in  other
              provinces  along  Gauteng's  border.  The  remaining  10%  are
              brought to the Centre by Home  Affairs  officials,  who  often
              travel from as far  as  Cape  Town,  Port  Elizabeth,  Durban,
              Umtata, Richard's Bay, etc. Immigrants are repatriated, almost
              on a daily basis, to border posts, Johannesburg  International
              Airport and Lanseria Airport.  Furthermore,  a  train  departs
              weekly to Mozambique from the  railway  station  next  to  the
              Centre.


         2. Site visit


              The delegation had an  opportunity  to  observe  the  kitchen,
              ablution facilities, sleeping quarters,  dining  hall,  sports
              field and recreation centre.


              Accommodation


              The delegation was presented with a document compiled  by  the
              Broadcasting Complaints Commission of  South  Africa  (BCCSA),
              which ruled out all allegations against the  Centre  that  had
              appeared in the media (see Annexure A).


              Inmates were free to move around inside the Centre,  but  they
              were not allowed to leave unless they were  being  repatriated
              to their countries of origin.


              Food


              An amount of R21,81 per day was allocated to each  inmate  for
              meals.


              Different menus  for  breakfast,  lunch  and  dinner  were  on
              display on the walls next to the kitchen. Meals were  prepared
              in the kitchen and then transported to  the  dining  hall  for
              distribution. There was also a canteen, where  various  things
              are sold.


              Bedrooms


              The sleeping area was divided  into  a  section  for  men  and
              women. Children under 10 were kept with their  mothers.  There
              was also a crèche for toddlers. During the  visit  the  crèche
              was closed because there were not enough children.  Each  room
              had a number of bunk beds.  Upon  arrival,  the  inmates  were
              allocated a room with a bed and blanket. One  of  the  inmates
              said that the  blankets  had  lice  and  bugs.  The  officials
              indicated that the inmates themselves brought these  lice  and
              bugs into the Centre. Blankets were sent to the  dry  cleaners
              twice a month.


              Mattresses were constantly being damaged, and this was evident
              in  the  men's  section.  The  damaged  ones   were   replaced
              regularly. Women had their own television  room.  Toilets  and
              showers were inside their rooms. Personal toiletries for women
              were provided on a daily basis and baby formula,  bottles  and
              teats were provided for mothers with babies.


              Health service


              The Centre had a clinic with one nurse on duty every day and a
              doctor who visited it on a daily basis. The  nurse  saw  about
              100 people per day. At around 10:45 on the day of  the  visit,
              the nurse had already seen over 50 persons.
              Security
              There was an electric perimeter fence as well as  a  run  with
              dogs.  The  facility  was  also  monitored  by  close  circuit
              television and cameras. Surveillance tapes recorded  by  these
              cameras were kept for 30 days. The  officials  indicated  that
              even though there was tight security,  inmates  sometimes  did
              escape. Some of them hid on the day of deportation  to  escape
              the scheduled deportation.


              Recreation facilities


              There was a  library  that  used  to  provide  newspapers  and
              magazines to inmates. Most of the material had been stolen and
              the  library  was  subsequently  closed.  There  was  also   a
              playground where inmates could play football and other  games.
              There were also a number of pay phones in  both  sections  for
              use by inmates. A Vodacom facility was located  in  the  men's
              section, but women were also allowed to use it.


              Communication with inmates


              There was an induction programme conducted by an official  for
              new inmates on their day of arrival. The person  who  did  the
              induction could speak some of the  languages  commonly  spoken
              and understood by the inmates.


     D.     Conclusion


         1. The level of compliance with human rights  principles  regarding
              the living conditions  and  the  basic  human  rights  of  the
              inmates appeared to be satisfactory.


         2. The Centre was in a very impressive  condition,  neat  and  very
              different from prison conditions.


         3. Food for inmates met the nutritional requirements.


         4. The women's section was cleaner  and  more  organised  than  the
              men's section.


         5. The clinic did not have adequate equipment  for  health  workers
              to fulfil  their  duties.  If  an  inmate  was  in  a  serious
              condition, he or she was taken to the nearest  hospital  under
              the supervision of a security guard.


         6. Ms Jacobus indicated that the delegation was satisfied with  the
              conditions at the Centre. It was the  complete  opposite  from
              what was reflected in the media.


     E.     Recommendations


         1. Staff should be protected against diseases that are  brought  to
              the Centre by inmates.
         2. Inmates should  undergo  check-ups  for  illnesses  or  diseases
              before they are admitted to the Centre.


         3. The Department of Home  Affairs  should  assist  the  Centre  by
              providing more staff and infrastructure in order  to  run  the
              facility more effectively.


         4. Additional health care  personnel  should  be  deployed  to  the
              Centre.


         5. The Departments of Home  Affairs  and  of  Safety  and  Security
              should clarify whose responsibility it is to provide  security
              for deportees.


         6. The Department of Home Affairs should take  strong  disciplinary
              action against officials who engage in  any  form  of  corrupt
              practice.


         7. An HIV/AIDS awareness programme should be implemented.
         8. Foreign missions should be encouraged to  respond  timeously  to
              requests for information by officials of the Centre.


         9. The Centre should be allocated its  own  budget  and  administer
              it, and should give an  account  of  its  expenditure  to  the
              Department of Home Affairs.


     Department of Home Affairs


     F.     Background


         The delegation  met  with  officials  at  the  Department  of  Home
         Affairs in Pretoria.


     G.     Findings


         1.  Overview  by  Mr  J  R  Chavalala,  Chief  Director:  Strategic
              Planning  and  Service  Delivery,  Home  Affairs,  and   other
              officials


              The officials briefed the delegation  on  the  smart  card  ID
              system. Discussions were taking place between the  Departments
              of Home Affairs, of  Health,  of  Social  Development  and  of
              Transport in order to include personal information from  these
              departments on the smart card. Discussions will also  have  to
              take place at Cabinet level before final approval is given for
              the system to be implemented.


              It will take about 18 months from the date of Cabinet approval
              to conclude the process of procurement and  contracting.  Once
              the contract is approved, it will take a further  nine  months
              before the first card is issued,  because  the  technology  to
              produce the card is currently not available in  this  country.
              Malaysia and  Finland  currently  have  this  technology.  The
              envisaged date for the issuing of the first smart card is  the
              beginning of 2003.
     H.     Recommendations


         1.  The  Department  should  expedite  its  discussions  with   the
              relevant departments.


         2. The Cabinet should agree  on  the  information  that  should  be
              captured on the smart card.


         3. The tender process should begin as soon as possible in order  to
              meet the envisaged date of 2003.


     I.     Annexure - Findings by BCCSA, published on 21 May 2001


         ``MESSAGE TO CLIENTS, STAKEHOLDERS AND STAFF OF BOSASA''


         "BROADCASTING COMPLAINTS COMMISSION FINDS IN FAVOUR OF  DYAMBU  AND
         BOSASA"


         1. You may be aware that Dyambu Operations (Pty)  Ltd,  now  called
              Bosasa, was in part the subject of a defamatory Carte  Blanche
              programme broadcast on the evening of Sunday 7  May  2000.  At
              the time we stated our intention to  pursue  every  avenue  to
              preserve our good name and  in  fact  laid  the  whole  matter
              before the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South  Africa
              (BCCSA).


         2. We are delighted to tell you that the BCCSA has not only  upheld
              the complaint of Dyambu Operations but has also censured Carte
              Blanche for contravening its Code of Conduct. A retraction was
              read on Carte Blanche yesterday evening the 20th May 2001  and
              published in the  national  press,  the  retraction  and  full
              judgment will be available on M-Net's website for the next two
              weeks.


         3. The findings are as follows:


              The commissioners (Prof Kobus van Rooyen SC with Dr Willem  de
              Klerk and Rathu Mokgoatheng) found that  negative  comment  on
              the Lindela facilities did not take fair and balanced  account
              of all related material facts.


              They found that the broadcast ignored several  positive  facts
              about  the  centre,  which  were  brought  to  the  producer's
              attention.  For  example,  it  failed   to   mention   several
              facilities, including a fully equipped clinic  with  a  doctor
              and qualified nurses, a  well-equipped  games  room,  four  TV
              rooms, a soccer field,  public  telephones,  a  fully  stocked
              canteen and a dining hall  serving  fully  balanced  and  well
              prepared meals.


         4. The commissioners reprimanded M-Net for its  negligence  in  not
              affording Dyambu Operations any opportunity of  responding  to
              negative and critical statements despite having promised to do
              so.


         5. The commissioners also found that M-Net  was  negligent  in  not
              making  reasonable  efforts  to  fairly  present   significant
              alternative  points  of  view  by  not  having   broadcast   a
              responding statement by Dyambu Operations.


         6. It also confirmed that there had been no  improprieties  in  the
              award of the tender by the Department of Home Affairs in 1996.


         7. The  enquiry  concluded  that  the  impression  created  in  the
              programme that politicians, including Dr. Lindiwe Sisulu,  had
              an interest in Dyambu  Operations,  the  company  awarded  the
              tender to manage the facility, was unfounded.


         8. The enquiry further concluded that the impression  created  that
              there were improper dealings in  the  company  structuring  of
              Dyambu Operations, was also unfounded and  could  easily  have
              been explained by a corporate lawyer as being in  accord  with
              ordinary corporate law.


         9. While regretting that the occasion should never have  arisen  in
              the first place, it is pleasing that our efforts have led to a
              satisfactory resolution of this unfortunate  affair,  and  has
              completely vindicated us of these allegations ...''
