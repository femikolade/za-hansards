                                    ____

The Speaker took the Chair and requested members  to  observe  a  moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

                                 NEW MEMBERS

                               (Announcement)

The Speaker announced that the vacancies that arose as a result of the
resignations of Ms N E Hangana, Dr M W Serote, Sister B Ncube and Ms P
Govender and by the deaths of Minister S V Tshwete and Mr P R Mokaba had
been filled, in accordance with item 6(3) of Schedule 6 to the
Constitution, 1996, by the nomination of Ms M M Ratsoma, Mr E N Mthethwa,
Ms S P Rwexana, Ms P Tshwete, Mr N Ngcobo and Ms M P Mentor, respectively,
with effect from 25 September 2002.

The members had made and subscribed to the oath  or  solemn  affirmation  in

[Applause.]

                           TEMPORARY SOUND SYSTEM

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, as you may be aware, the  sound  system  is
not in proper operation. A temporary  system  has  been  installed  and  the
microphones at the podium are  operational.  However,  if  members  wish  to
address the Chair on points of order,  which  I  hope  will  not  arise,  or
similar issues, they should rise in their seats  and  once  they  have  been
recognised by the Chair a roving microphone will be brought to them.

                  CONDITIONS OF SERVICE OF PUBLIC PROTECTOR

                (Consideration of Portfolio Committee Report)

Report adopted without debate.

               EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS OF PUBLIC PROTECTOR STAFF

                (Consideration of Portfolio Committee Report)

Report adopted without debate.

                       APPOINTMENT OF PUBLIC PROTECTOR

                 (Consideration of Ad Hoc Committee Report)

Mr M J MAHLANGU: Madam Speaker, I stand here today to report to the
National Assembly that the committee concluded its work yesterday in
considering the candidate who should be recommended by the National
Assembly to the President as the person to be appointed as Public Protector
of the country.

The mandate that the committee had was to interview a number of candidates
and appoint the most suitable candidate for the post. I wish to announce
the name of the candidate recommended by the committee to the National
Assembly today. He is Mabedle Lawrence Mushwana. [Applause.]

I also wish to report to the National Assembly that all the political
parties who participated throughout the interviews - all of those that were
there - agreed with the nomination unanimously, except one party, which is
the DP. [Interjections.]

However, in the one minute that I have got, I can say Mr Mushwana has been
an interpreter clerk, a clerk of a magistrate court, a public prosecutor, a
magistrate, Chairperson of Committees in the NCOP, co-chairperson on a code
of conduct and ethics committee, and currently he is the Deputy Chairperson
of the NCOP. Previously he has also served articles of clerkship, practised
as an attorney, served on an audit commission and is a commissioner serving
in the Judicial Service Commission. Section 181(2) of the Constitution
says:


  These institutions ...

- I am talking about the Chapter 9 institutions -
  ... are independent, and subject only to the Constitution  and  the  law,
  and they must be impartial and must exercise  their  powers  and  perform
  their function without fear, favour or prejudice.

Mr Mushwana acquitted himself very well in all these positions in  which  he
served  and  they  were  all  positions  of  impartiality.  [Applause.]   He
understands, clearly, the powers and functions of  a  Public  Protector,  he
understands the accessibility of the office and he has  a  clear  vision  of
what he is going to do if he takes up that office. He also  understands  the
problems of the citizens of this country and he speaks no less  than  10  of
this country's official languages. [Applause.]

Mr Mushwana has acquitted himself very clearly and very well  of  all  these
aspects and he has ruled in this  Parliament  according  to  the  Rules  and
Regulations of the National Council of Provinces. He also took decisions  in
an impartial manner when he was an attorney, doing a wonderful job.

I wish to thank the committee for the wonderful job that  it  has  done  and
all other political parties that supported the nomination. The ANC  supports
the nomination. [Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Madam Speaker, the DP reiterates its strongest opposition
to the nomination of ANC MP, and NCOP Deputy Chairperson, the hon Mushwana
to become the new Public Protector. It is mind-boggling that the ANC is
trying to fill a position which should be independent of party-political
influence, and of Government influecne, with an elected ANC public
representative. [Interjections.] This is not the first time that the ANC
has tried to achieve this. They recently failed to put former Limpopo MEC
... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Adv H C SCHMIDT: They recently failed to put former Limpopo MEC Adv Seth
Nthai in the same position. It should go without saying that Mr Mushwana's
appointment is utterly inappropriate. He is an active party politician from
the ruling party. The ANC requires its cadres to remain loyal to it
irrespective of where they are ``deployed.'' The position requires that the
incumbent be responsible only to the Constitution and the law. The public
needs to be able to trust the integrity of institutions designed to protect
their interests. [Interjections.]

The international community, including the community of investors, needs to
believe that the future of our constitutional democracy is safe and that no
action that erodes the supremacy of the Constitution will be tolerated.

Ek wil dit ondubbelsinnig stel dat die DP die totale minagting en nie-
nakoming ... [Tussenwerpsels.] [I want to state unequivocally that in the
opinion of the DP the total disregard of and non-compliance with ...
[Interjections.]]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, would you take your seat, please.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I would like
to know if only a eunuch could be qualified for this job, or are other
factors taken into account? [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, we are dealing with a very serious debate.
[Interjections.] Order! All of you! We should at least respect the office
which we are talking about. [Interjections.] And I do not believe frivolous
points of order or the kind of ruckus that exists on both sides of the
House ... [Applause.] Let us be very clear, the noise on both sides of the
House does not befit the subject which we are trying to address seriously.
We ought to set an example by how we disagree. [Interjections.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Mevrou die Speaker, ek wil dit ondubbelsinnig stel dat die
DP die totale minagting en nie-nakoming van die beginsel van
onafhanklikheid van Hoofstuk 9-instansies, soos dié van die Openbare
Beskermer, heftig sal opponeer. Aangesien daar 'n persepsie by die publiek
geskep word dat 'n ANC-amptenaar as Openbare Beskermer verkies is deur die
ANC gedomineerde komitee ten einde 'n hoë pos te beklee uit hoofde van die
ANC se genade, bestaan die gevoel dat sodanige posbekleër gevolglik ook nie
onafhanklik en sonder vrees, bevoordeling of bevooroordeeldheid teenoor die
uitvoerende gesag namens die publiek sal optree nie. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Adv H C SCHMIDT: Madam Speaker, I want to state unequivocally that the DP
will strongly oppose the total disregard of and non-compliance with the
principle of the independence of Chapter 9 institutions, such as the Public
Protector. Since the perception is being created amongst the public that an
ANC official was elected as Public Protector by an ANC-dominated committee
to fill a top position owing to an act of grace on the part of the ANC, the
feeling is that such incumbent will consequently also not act on the
public's behalf in an independent and fearless manner and without favouring
or showing partiality towards the executive authority. [Applause.]]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker. The IFP will be supporting Mr Mushwana, not
because he is a member of the ANC, most certainly not, but because we
believe he is a man of integrity and is impartial. [Interjections.]

Those of us who have worked with him know him to be a man of integrity and
we know he is impartial in his judgement on others. We would expect him to
carry that impartiality through and to protect the public in general at all
times. We support the motion. [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, the New NP has proposed Mr Mushwana's name in
the portfolio committee as the best candidate to become Public Protector.
If one looks at Mr Mushwana's legal record, one finds that he is well
qualified. He practised as an attorney and a magistrate, and at one stage
he was a public prosecutor. He in fact worked in the then homeland
administration, so he knows exactly what is wrong and what to do in solving
structural problems. [Applause.]

If one looks at his involvement in Parliament - and a lot has been said
about his independence or his ability to act - Mr Mushwana is co-chair of
the Ethics Committee that dealt with the stalwart of the ANC, Winnie
Mandela. Who can then question his independence and fairness?
[Interjections.]

Those of us who have worked with him in Parliament for the past eight
years, know about his involvement in the NCOP, especially in the provinces.
When the Auditor-General's report comes before us we interrogate it and
decide what needs to be done. Parliament should be proud today, because Mr
Mushwana is a product of this Parliament. We developed him and are now
sending him out to serve this country as best as he can.

I think that the greatest concern of the DA is that they see swart gevaar
and black angst. ``Can this native do the job?'' they wonder. They
therefore voted against his nomination. [Interjections.] I would like to
echo our chairperson's request that all political parties in this House
support the nomination. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I rise here in unambiguous support of the
nomination before us. We do so, not because the incumbent is a political
functionary, or was one until today, but because we believe that he is the
correct choice and therefore needs to be supported.

We need to look at the Office of the Public Protector beyond the realms of
politics. We wish to divorce the two issues. On the one hand we support the
incumbent for what he is and for what we believe he will mean to our
country. On the other hand, we wish to point out that in terms of Chapter 9
of the Constitution, which lays down clearly that this particular office
shall only be subject to the Constitution and the law and that the
incumbent must be impartial and exercise his or her powers and perform his
or her functions without fear, favour or prejudice, we would be able to
obviate this type of argument and debate if we put some policy and
guidelines in place to guide us in future appointments to Chapter 9
institutions.

Amongst them, of course, an important one would be the Electoral
Commission. There could be a massive outcry if political functionaries were
immediately appointed to such an office.

My party supports this appointment and we would like to appeal to all South
Africans that we should bring this debate to a level where we can protect
the Office of the Public Protector and see that it gets the necessary
support, acceptance and respect from all citizens of our country. We are
the first ones who should lead by example. [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, the ACDP was unable to participate in the ad
hoc committee owing to our size. With regard to Mr Mushwana's merit,
demeanour and independence, we have no problem with his merit and
demeanour. However, there are two sides to independence. They are actual
independence and perceived independence. We think that on the issue of
perceived independence there might be some difficulties. Consequently we
have chosen to abstain. [Interjections.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, die partye wat reeds gepraat het, mis in
'n groot mate die punt waaroor dit vandag hier gaan. Die vraag is nie of
mnr Mushwana bekwaam is nie. Natuurlik is hy bekwaam. Die vraag is nie of
hy onpartydig is nie. Natuurlik is hy nie partydig nie. Die een ding wat
mnr Mahlangu nagelaat het om te doen, was om ook vir die publiek daar buite
te sê dat die voorgestelde kandidaat tans in hierdie Parlement dien as 'n
lid van die ANC. Dit is 'n feit.

Dit gaan nie oor die individu nie. Dit gaan oor die Hoofstuk 9-instellings
ingevolge die Grondwet en as ons ernstig is oor die onpartydigheid van die
persone in daardie poste, dan behoort die Parlement, van alle plekke, die
voorbeeld te stel. Om daardie rede kan dit nooit aanvaarbaar wees dat 'n
dienende lid van 'n politieke party in so 'n pos aangestel word nie. Dit
gaan nie oor die individu nie. Dit gaan oor die voorbeeld wat ons stel. In
elke ander party hier is daar net sulke bekwame mense, maar in hierdie
geval behoort 'n mens nie 'n politieke aanstelling te doen nie. Ons stel
die verkeerde voorbeeld. Die VF kan dit nie steun nie. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, to a great extent the parties who have
already spoken are missing the point about the topic under discussion here
today. The question is not whether Mr Mushwana is competent. Of course he
is competent. The question is not whether he is unbiased. Of course he is
not biased. The one thing that Mr Mahlangu neglected to do was to also tell
the public out there that the proposed candidate is currently serving in
this Parliament as a member of the ANC. That is a fact.

This is not about the individual. This is about the Chapter 9 institutions
in terms of the Constitution, and if we are serious about the impartiality
of the persons in those posts, then Parliament, of all places, should set
an example. For that reason it can never be acceptable that a serving
member of a political party be appointed to such a post. This is not about
the individual. It is about the example we are setting. Every other party
here also has people who are just as competent, but in this case one should
not make a political appointment. We are setting the wrong example. The FF
cannot support this. [Applause.]]
Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members, the UCDP, right from the
onset, supported the appointment of Mr Mushwana as Public Protector on the
simple grounds that he has showed his ability in executing his duties as an
impartial Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP. However, his demeanour also
indicated that he was a quiet and simple man who did not hide who he was,
even during the deliberations. This has made him a deserving candidate.

We have had instances of people, although they are not involved in Chapter
9 institutions, who left Parliament, such as Mr Bulelani Ngcuka, wherever
he is, and Mr Chris Fismer, who is chairman of the National Gambling Board,
and these people are doing perfectly well. These people were members of the
ANC and nobody has a problem with them. We only hope that with these
examples, people can leave politics and do the work they are meant to do.
On these grounds Mr Mushwana is just the right person in our opinion.
[Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, we have here a question of a principle and a
question of a candidate. I want to support the view that it would sometimes
be good that when we are not talking about a name that we should talk about
the principle. On the question of the candidature, however, I want to say
that the PAC fully supports the candidate. We believe that the work that Mr
Mushwana has done here in Parliament was possibly more difficult than the
work he is going to do outside of Parliament. He is qualified and he has
satisfied us here that he can perform the job. We would like to support the
candidate and wish him well. We hope that he will acquit himself creditably
in his new job. He should leave Parliament in the knowledge that this House
supports him. [Applause.]

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mevrou die Speaker, die agb lid Mahlangu kan nie sê dat
al die partye hierdie voorstel steun nie, want die FA was nie betrokke by
die komitee nie, en daarom wil ons hier ons stem bekend maak. Die FA stem
om drie redes teen hierdie aanstelling. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[Mr J P BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, the hon member Mahlangu cannot say that all
the parties support this motion, seeing as the FA was not involved with the
committee, and that is why we want to announce our vote here. The FA will
be voting against this appointment for three reasons.]

The ANC should know that a politician should not even be considered for
redeployment to a Chapter 9 committee or position ... [Interjections.] ...
and especially not to the position of Public Protector.

Dit bring my by die tweede rede waarom ons die aanstelling teenstaan. Die
persoon se rekord as 'n voorsitter van een van die ad hoc-komitees het ons
oortuig dat hy hom nie kan losmaak van die druk wat politieke partye op hom
uitoefen nie. Derdens het sy optrede in die posisie wat hy in daardie
komitee beklee het veel te wense oorgelaat. Omdat hierdie amp vereis dat
die bekleër iemand moet wees wat vaardighede besit waaroor die aangewese
kandidaat nie beskik nie, laat dit ons met geen ander keuse nie as om
daarteen te stem. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This brings me to the second reason why we are opposing this appointment.
The person's record as chairperson of one of the ad hoc committees has
convinced us that he cannot detach himself from the pressure that political
parties put on him. Thirdly, his conduct in the position that he occupied
in that committee left much to be desired. Seeing that this post requires
the incumbent to possess skills which the designated candidate does not
possess, we are left with no other option than to vote against the
appointment. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the nomination by the Ad Hoc Committee of Mr M L
Mushwana for appointment as Public Protector be approved.

Division Demanded.

The SPEAKER: Order! As hon members are aware, the electronic voting system
is not working, and the agreed process is that the whips or party
representatives will now be given an opportunity to establish how many
members of their party are in the House. I will then request them to
announce the number of members of their party present and whether or not
their party members support the recommendation. If any member wishes to
vote separately, he or she should approach the Table before the decision on
the vote is announced.

The House divided:
  AYES - 278 (ANC-228, IFP-19, New NP-19, UDM-8, UCDP-2, PAC-1, AZAPO-1).


  NOES - 32 (DP-29, FF-1, FA-2).


  ABSTENTIONS - 6 (ACDP-5, PAC-1).

Nomination approved in terms of section 193(5) of the Constitution.

Appointment of Mr M L Mushwana as Public Protector accordingly recommended.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order: During the speech
by the hon Durand he made reference to the fact that the reason why the DP
was against Mr Mushwana was that he was a black man. He used words to that
effect. Those were not his exact words. [Interjections.] I believe that
this is unparliamentary and I ask you to please look at Hansard and report
back to this House. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I will look at Hansard and rule
accordingly. Hon members, before we proceed, as one of the members of this
House said earlier in the debate, whatever our differences, the time has
come to put them behind us. Once the Public Protector is appointed it
behoves us to support the office and its work, as well as the person
holding the office, and to regard any finding free of party-political
perspectives. So I appeal to all of us, this being an important part of our
Constitution, to please come together and support the office and the member
who occupies it. [Applause.]

                        EDUCATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                  (Decision of Question on Second Reading)

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

Division demanded.

The House divided:


  AYES - 255 (ANC-222, IFP-21, UDM-8, PAC-2, MF-1, AZAPO-1).


  NOES - 59 (DP-29, New NP-20, ACDP-5, FF-1, UCDP-2, FA-2).

Question agreed to.

Bill accordingly read a second time.

                      HOSTING OF PAN AFRICAN PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The SPEAKER: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to move without notice:


  That the House recommends to the Executive that South Africa give serious
  consideration to hosting the Pan African Parliament.

The Pan African Parliament will play a major role in shaping the African
Union and its organ to meet the aspirations of the people of this
continent. Locating the parliament on South African soil will both allow us
to contribute to building and consolidating democracy in Africa, and,
importantly, afford South Africans the opportunity to learn from the very
rich experience and achievements of the institutions on our continent. I so
move.
Motion agreed to.

The House adjourned at 14:56.
