Dr E E JASSAT: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC at the next
sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital is the largest
       hospital in the world, serving the needs of the people of Gauteng and
       beyond;


  (2) acknowledges that an R82 million upgrade is currently under way;


  (3) commends the Government for making the funds available which will
       ease the plight of patients and staff working under difficult
       conditions; and


  (4) commends the staff of the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital for their
       dedication and commitment to the needs of the ill, often under trying
       conditions.

[Applause.]

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the latest controversies playing themselves out in South
       African soccer;


  (2) further notes the steady decline in the performance of South African
       national teams on the world stage;


  (3) recognises that the woes in South African sport stem from national
       administrators giving their allegiance to political bosses rather
       than the men and women who play sport and aspire to represent their
       country;


  (4) condemns the ongoing, self-serving interference in sport by the
       Minister of Sport and Recreation and his political lackeys; and


  (5) calls on the Government to stop abusing sport to further their
       political careers and to give sport back to the players.

[Interjections.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) appreciates attempts at augmenting the safe landing of aeroplanes as
       evidenced in the mock plane crash exercise at Cape Town International
       Airport by Storm Evaluators;


  (2) realises that this company took into account the fact that there
       might be some hiccups with the rescue mission if the plane were to
       crash at Cape Town International Airport;


  (3) further compliments the company on staging such exercises as a
       proactive and visionary approach aimed at securing the lives of
       passengers; and

       solve this perceived security threat.

       urgent corrective measures to ensure that these delays and
       bottlenecks are eliminated; and

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE: Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek sal
voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  van die huidige krisis in die Suid-Afrikaanse melkbedryf wat
           veroorsaak is deur die waardevermindering van die rand;


       (b)  van die feit dat talle melkboere die afgelope tyd bankrot
           verklaar is omdat dit duurder geraak het om melk te produseer as
           wat hulle daarvoor betaal word;


       (c)  dat supermarkte 'n monopolie op die melkprys het en sodoende
           boere uitbuit; en


       (d)  dat die melkbedryf in Suid-Afrika gevaar loop om heeltemal tot
           niet te gaan omdat top genetiese melkkoeie nou geslag word; en


  (2) 'n beroep op die Minister vir Landbou en Grondsake doen om dringend
       aandag aan die melkbedryf te gee en saam met boere te werk om die
       krisis op te los.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the current crisis in the South African milk industry that was
           caused by the depreciation in the value of the rand;


       (b)  the fact that in recent times many dairy farmers have been
           declared insolvent because it has become more expensive to
           produce milk than what they are being paid for it;


       (c)  that supermarkets have a monopoly on the milk price and are
           consequently exploiting farmers; and


       (d)  that the milk industry in South Africa is running the risk of
           total collapse, because top genetic milk cows are now being
           slaughtered; and


  (2) appeals to the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs to pay
       urgent attention to the milk industry and to co-operate with farmers
       in order to resolve the crisis.]

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  the horror accounts of the physical, mental and sexual abuse and
           torture of the pride of our nations, the future of our nations,
           our children, unfolded in evidence before the Task Group on
           Child Abuse hearings during the past few days; and


       (b)  that as we gather here this morning many of our beloved children
           are being abused and tortured;


  (2) therefore calls on the Government to -


       (a)  immediately and without fail implement urgent measures to save
           our children from such abuse;


       (b)  immediately and without fail empower the Family Violence Unit of
           the SAPS with dedicated, skilled personnel and sufficient
           resources, human and material, to help end this scourge; and


       (c)  deal with perpetrators, when found guilty, in the harshest
           terms, to serve as a deterrent; and


  (3) says to these demons: Hands off the pride of our nations - our
       children; we South Africans will sort you out; there is no place for
       you in our society.

[Applause.]

Prof B TUROK: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) wishes to commemorate the outstanding contribution to the continent
       of Africa of the late Prof Bade Onimode, Deputy Vice Chancellor of
       the University of Ibadan, Nigeria; and
  (2) notes that -


       (a)  Prof Onimode was one of the most distinguished economists in
           Africa and an ardent exponent of African unity and regional
           integration;


       (b)  he visited South Africa on several occasions, participated in
           conferences, delivered lectures at universities and made
           substantial policy contributions to seminars of
           parliamentarians; and


       (c)  he was a charismatic intellectual with a deep passion for the
           development of the continent and would have been an important
           economist in the Nepad process.

[Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  that a 14-year study into underage pregnancy in the UK has
           questioned the effectiveness of policies which increase easy
           availability of contraceptives for children under 16, and that
           the lead researcher, Dr Paton, has said that an increase in
           access to family planning clinics has not decreased pregnancy
           rates but even increased them in some instances as it encourages
           more people to have sex, and a high contraceptive failure rate
           adds to the problem;


       (b)  that the UK Government is expected shortly to launch a sex
           education campaign in reaction to the alarming figures for the
           growth in sexually transmitted diseases, claiming that previous
           attempts have been sadly counter-productive with sex education
           having become inflamed by its own material and now being
           increasingly lewd, leering and graphic; and


       (c)  with disgust the Love Life campaign material in South Africa
           which encourages masturbation and blatantly stimulates sexual
           responses in youth;


  (2) calls on the Government to stop this obscenity which purports to be a
       campaign to encourage children to talk openly about sex;


  (3) acknowledges that children should be encouraged to talk openly to
       parents and other responsible adults ...

[Time expired.]

Mr A C NEL: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) recognises the outstanding work of volunteers at the Pretoria
       Magistrate's Court who assist with its Women and Violent Sexual
       Crimes Programme, the Maintenance Forum and the Volunteer Upliftment
       Programme;


  (2) acknowledges that these programmes offer invaluable counselling and
       administrative assistance to the court, the latter programme having
       allowed 70 youths from disadvantaged communities to be trained and
       mentored as legal clerks;


  (3) notes that most youths have acquired skills and experience which have
       enabled them to find employment within four months; and


  (4) calls on communities to be involved with their institutions to uplift
       such institutions for the benefit of the community.

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall
move:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  many military veterans feel neglected because they were not
           included in the integration of forces into the SANDF and were
           excluded from pension benefits;


       (b)  on 19 June 2001 the Minister of Defence gave his assurance in
           this House that he would give special attention to their plight,
           a promise he repeated on 18 October 2001; and


       (c)  the failure of the Minister to act has led to escalating
           protests by these veterans; and


  (2) calls on the Minister to honour his promises and to urgently address
       this matter before it becomes a threat to the country's internal
       security.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move on behalf
of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) acknowledges the rights of parents to send their children to schools
       of their choice anywhere in the country;


  (2) is concerned about the media reports that a large number of learners
       migrate from the Eastern Cape to the Western Cape province, thus
       leaving the Eastern Cape Department of Education unable to plan
       meaningfully and effectively for its infrastructural needs;


  (3) notes that -


       (a)  such migration of learners is largely caused by the lack of
           basic needs such as electricity, water and learning support
           materials; and


       (b)  teachers are leaving this province looking for better
           opportunities in other provinces; and


  (4) asks for urgent intervention by both the province and the Minister of
       Education.

Mr G P MNGOMEZULU: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the Angolan government has offered blanket amnesty to all
           Unita soldiers; and


       (b)  reports that Unita is considering the peace offer by the Angolan
           government;


  (2) believes that this presents an opportunity for peaceful resolution of
       the conflict in Angola;


  (3) welcomes the gesture by the Angolan government which is aimed at
       putting the Lusaka Accord back on track; and


  (4) calls on all parties to work towards the peaceful resolution of
       conflict in Angola.

[Applause.]

Mr A Z A van JAARSVELD: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move
at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) is in full agreement with the President that lazy public servants are
       a liability to the state and should not be kept in their positions;
       and


  (2) believes the Minister for the Public Service and Administration
       should put measures and procedures into place in order to identify
       such public servants and deal with them accordingly.

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Reserve Bank has raised the repo rate yesterday with 1%; and


       (b)  the Reserve Bank has chosen this course based on increasingly
           inflationary pressure, mainly from increasing food prices;


  (2) acknowledges that this development will place a further burden upon
       poor and working-class people, who are already struggling to survive;


  (3) is dismayed at the manner in which the tax cuts the Minister of
       Finance has announced are now cancelled out by this development; and


  (4) calls upon the Government to take measures to ensure that increasing
       food prices are brought under control to prevent large-scale hunger
       and poverty.

Mr D M GUMEDE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Sasol is hosting a ``Science and Technology Festival
       2000'' for schoolgoing youth in Grahamstown today; and


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  this festival will contribute positively in mentoring our youth
           to have keen interests in science and technology; and


       (b)  knowledgeable workers in science and technology are an important
           requirement for foreign direct investment and economic growth.

[Applause.]

Mr D C MABENA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  on 8 March 2002 the ANC parliamentary office in Atteridgeville,
           in partnership with the community, organised a successful matric
           award ceremony;


       (b)  this ceremony was in honour of learners from all the high
           schools in the area who performed well during the 2001 matric
           examinations; and


  (2) commends -


       (a)  the partnership between the Gauteng MEC for Education, Ignatius
           Jacobs, retired teachers' organisations and local businesses;
           and


       (b)  the alumni of these schools for their positive motivation and
           encouragement of learners.

[Applause.]

                    PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY LEVIES BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon members, apologies for the slight
delay. The Private Security Industry Regulation Act, Act 56 of 2001, was
passed in Parliament in November last year. The Act provides for, amongst
other things, the regulation of the private security industry by a special
industry regulatory authority.

The authority will act through a council of five members, who are required
to be independent and not to have any interest in the private security
industry. The cost of regulating the private security industry will be
borne by the members of the industry who are registered with the regulatory
authority. The funds of the authority will be derived from the imposition
of levies upon members of the private security industry by the regulatory
council.
In terms of the principal Act, the state will be responsible for the fees
of the members of the appeal committee to preserve their independence. What
the Private Security Industry Levies Bill does is to deal with the sections
of the principal Act which allow for the imposition of these levies. It is
my belief that the Bill contains sufficient provisions for checks and
balances to ensure that the funds of the authority are well managed and
that the regulatory authority operates in a transparent and accountable
manner. The Bill empowers the authority to address any situations arising
with regard to the nonpayment of levies.

In placing this Bill before the House, I take the opportunity to thank the
Minister and Deputy Minister of Safety and Security for their co-operation
and assistance in the drafting of the Bill, and I trust that there is a
very strong basis for going forward. I hereby table the Private Security
Industry Levies Bill, 2002. [Applause.]
Bill, together with the introductory speech, referred to the Portfolio
Committee on Safety and Security for consideration and report.
                BURUNDI PROTECTION SUPPORT APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Ms T R MODISE: Chairperson, hon members, the ANC supports the Burundi
Protection Support Appropriation Bill. A few years ago South Africa
established a peace force. Some of us will remember with mirth and
sometimes with anger and sadness the antics that came out of that force. It
definitely did not do anything to enhance the image South Africans had of
our defence forces and our attempts to try to reorientate them.

However, the South Africa Constitution and the White Paper on Defence, gave
us provisions and mandates to start looking beyond the borders of South
Africa not only to get involved in humanitarian aid, but also to play an
active role in peacekeeping and peacemaking. Our contribution in this
regard is what this appropriating Bill is all about.

We are looking at the first South African protection support group going
out with pride. I am sure a week ago some of us saw on TV how our members
were interacting with the communities of Burundi. I am sure I was not the
only one whose heart was filled with pride at the fact that they were not
only being called sons, but also that they were learning and exchanging
cultural games with the people of Burundi.

One cannot remove this experience from that of rebuilding and the rebirth
of Africa. One cannot talk about any development at all with regard to
South Africa, Botswana and Nigeria without looking at the overall need for
stability on the continent. By sending these men and women into the Burundi
we are contributing to that stability. Stability must create a condition
conducive to negotiations taking place. Of course, it is a bit worrying
that the peace agreement has still not been put on the table in Burundi,
but we are getting there. We are contributing and we are proud of that.

When South Africans took the Defence Review to the villages in 1996, they
determined what members of the SA National Defence Force had to do. When
South Africa is required to do what we are doing today in Burundi, we must
also acknowledge that it comes with a price. That price, which today stands
at R129 million, is nothing in comparison with the amount of peace that we
will enjoy as a continent. The possibility of South Africa recouping every
cent of the commitments from countries and governments to pay towards this
peace dividend is tremendous. The goodwill that South Africa gets is also
tremendous, but the high moral standing that we get out of this is very
significant.

Therefore, from the defence committees of Parliament we wish our boys and
girls in Burundi every success. We support this appropriation Bill.
[Applause.]

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Chairperson, I fully agree with what the hon Modise
has just said. I just have a different approach in my contribution today.

It is essential for any responsible country, when having to decide on its
military force design, first to formulate its own political objectives,
which in turn can only be determined by taking into account the country's
political vision, philosophy, policies, strategies, etc. Since 1994 Africa
has come to the forefront for South Africa and it was essential for us to
decide on the political importance of the various countries to South
Africa.

There are three basic questions which need to be asked. Firstly, which
territorial areas are of vital importance to South Africa? Secondly, which
countries have a direct influence on South Africa? Lastly, which countries
are only of interest to us?

We are now involved in the DRC in peace support operations on a very
limited scale. In Burundi we have a much larger force, a battalion
strength, to protect 26 returning politicians in terms of the Arusha
Accord. My question is: Do both these operations fall within our political
strategy and planning, or are they verging on side shows?
We understand why South Africa was suddenly drawn into the Burundi
operation, and at the time we supported the deployment of our troops there.
Such sudden tasks mean that funds have to be found which were not in the
defence budget, nor were the troops planned for. They could have been
better employed in the control of our northern borders, especially at this
time.

In the Burundi case, Nigeria, Senegal and Ghana agreed to assist, but this
has not materialised. Pledges for funding have been received or are in the
final process of delivery. In the meantime our troops are there, where they
have to be accommodated, fed, paid allowances, and provided with various
other support services.

We cannot rescind on our commitment, but we request that proper estimates
and plans be made in future to ensure that we have the military resources
and funds to get involved in these external operations. The DA supports the
Bill.

Mr H J BEKKER: Chairperson, the hon Schalkwyk has more or less indicated
what I wanted to say.

The IFP, despite certain reservations about the deployment of our soldiers
in Burundi, supported our participation in Burundi on the express condition
that foreign developed countries would foot the bill and refund South
Africa in the end, and furthermore, that South Africa would not be the only
African country that would be supplying soldiers and supportive structures
in Burundi.

To the best of my knowledge South Africa should have been supported and
joined by Nigeria, Senegal and Ghana in a joint training force in Burundi.
These countries' contributions have still not materialised, and we find
ourselves holding the responsibility and paying the tab.

Foreign countries have as yet not played their financing role and, with the
exception of some moneys received from the EU, we are still waiting. The
IFP wishes to express its concern about the outstanding promises and urges
Government and the military to have their ducks properly in a row before
Parliament is requested for assistance.

Nevertheless, we support our soldiers and our boys on the border. We cannot
have them receive no remuneration and food, and with this in mind the IFP
will support the Bill.

Dr P J RABIE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, the aim of this
Bill is to appropriate an additional amount of money for the requirements
of the Department of Defence, not exceeding R130 million, in respect of the
2001-2002 financial year. The following countries have promised the
following amounts of donor money: Netherlands R17,6 million, Belgium 5,5
million euros, Britain 1,5 million pounds, Norway 9 million krone and the
US $5 million.

Mr Chairperson, the rule of law, the maintenance of basic human rights and
political stability are key ingredients for sustained future economic
growth at national, regional and global levels. Sub-Saharan Africa is no
exception to the rule.
Burundi, as a country, has had a very sad history of strife, bloodshed and
disappointing economic growth. The efforts of former President Nelson
Mandela to bring peace and settle deep fundamental cultural and political
differences in this country are indeed commendable, and I think we as South
Africans should be very proud of this.

The SA National Defence Force's peacekeeping force performs an important
role in bringing peace to this area as well. Burundi and some of its
neighbours can be categorised as Third World emerging countries. Trade in
many of these countries has diminished in relation to national income.
Another feature is that economic growth has been limited and poverty has
risen to an alarming degree.

The economic global shocks of 2001, since 11 September in particular, have
worsened the process of economic marginalisation of many of these countries
in the centre of Africa. The economic wellbeing of Burundi and all other
countries in sub-Saharan Africa is of fundamental importance to South
Africa, being the largest industrial country within this subregion. A large
number of countries within sub-Saharan Africa have slipped into recession.
People vote with their feet. The thousands of migrants and political
refugees in the present sub-Saharan Africa are an example of this. The role
of political instability, the failure of ecomomies to provide employment,
declining living standards and violent crime do not bid well for our
particular region.

I repeat, the presence of the SA National Defence Force in Burundi is a
proactive measure. It is in the interests of the entire sub-Saharan Africa
and the New NP supports this Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Mr Chairperson and hon members, the Bill provides for
expenditure in emergency situations in terms of section 16(1) of the Public
Finance Management Act, namely for protection services by members of the
SANDF for returning opposition leaders in Burundi.

Currently we have approximately 700 soldiers deployed in Burundi. I want to
assume that our soldiers in Burundi are well trained and well behaved, and
that they are contributing to the peace process in that country. If this is
indeed the case we should welcome our contribution to bring stability in
that country.

Owing to the fact that this is a money Bill, I must raise the issue of cost-
effectiveness to deploy a contingent of 700 soldiers in Burundi. At R130
million for the current financial year, it implies an average cost of R186
000 for each soldier. If we assume that we will keep our number of soldiers
deployed in Burundi at 700 military personnel for the 2002-03 financial
year, at an estimated cost of R217 million, the average cost for each
soldier over this period amounts to R310 000, or approximately R26 000 per
month for each soldier. This equals the monthly salary of a member of
Parliament in this House. From a cost-effective point of view, our
involvement in Burundi is indeed a very expensive exercise.

We trust that the South African Government will do everything in its power
to encourage the various donor countries to contribute financially to the
deployment of soldiers in Burundi. If such funds are indeed deposited into
the National Revenue Fund, they should assist in bringing down the average
cost of keeping soldiers deployed in that country. The UDM supports the
Burundi Protection Support Appropriation Bill.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, hon members, I am sure I will
be able to allay some of the concerns that have been raised in terms of the
moneys that have been pledged by various countries for this operation. I
also want to thank the members for supporting this Bill. May I remind
members that we do not have boys on the border, but men and women in our SA
National Defence Force and not in the SA Defence force. [Applause.] Some of
our borders are being guarded by African women soldiers. I am so proud of
that and I think members of the House must be proud of that too.
[Applause.]

The contingent of the SA National Defence Force members who have been
serving in Burundi since 1 November last year will be relieved and replaced
in a process which will be completed by 22 March 2002. Their mission is to
perform protection tasks for the returning exiled leaders before the
inauguration of the interim government in Burundi. The mission has already
been assessed as successful, as nearly all the exiled leaders have returned
since the SA National Defence Force was placed in Burundi.

The 2001-02 to 2002-03 projected expenditure for this mission covers
personnel allowances of R55,589 million; the cost of equipment and
facilities amounts to R57,663 million; sustainment of our soldiers amounts
to R42,804 million; aircraft, chartering and transport amount to R222,846
million; and medical consumables and equipment amount to R10,252 million.
In total the mission is expected to cost R389,154 million.

Coming to the pledges, pledges to fund the deployment from the
international community amounting to R266 million have been received, of
which R17 million has been realised. Agreements have been finalised with
the European Union to the amount of 9,5 million euros; Belgium 5,5 million
euros; the Netherlands 10 million guilders. The agreement with the UK
amounts to £1,5 million. These agreements are at an advanced stage and the
United States of America and Norway are considering contributing. So the
concerns that members have, I think, are unfounded.

To ensure regularity and propriety in terms of the Public Finance
Management Act, the Minister of Finance was requested to authorise the
expenditure of the deployment by exercising his section 16 powers.
Subsequent to approval, the President will be requested to indicate the
period within which Parliament and the Auditor-General is to be advised in
accordance with section 16(4)(a).
Preparation for the SA National Defence Force members dispatched to Burundi
includes an orientation on the country of Burundi, so South Africa will
definitely gain, because when those members come back they will inform us
about Burundi.

Preparation also covers a briefing on the political developments in Burundi
and the role-players in the current negotiation process; the military
operational situation in Burundi; the memorandum of understanding between
the Republic of South Africa and the transitional government in Burundi;
the rules of engagement; operational military law; telecommunications and
the functioning of the field post office; operational security guidelines;
medical evaluation organisation, hygiene and first aid; payment of
allowances; the SANDF code of conduct; language orientation; and mind
awareness.

Indeed, I do think members will realise, this being one of our initial
experiences with peace support operations, that we are going to come back -
our soldiers are going to come back - having grown and developed from
personally experiencing being part of this operation.

This deployment is a very important part of South Africa's peacekeeping
efforts. The deployment not only covers the protection of the exiled
leaders as they return to Burundi, but also the training of a Burundian VIP
protection service. Those members who are concerned about there not being
participation at this stage by our Western neighbours, I should think,
actually realise that the process will still go forward in terms of
training the Burundian VIP protection service.

Another function we perform when our members come back is to debrief and
demobilise them, because when soldiers are deployed, it is very important
that they are debriefed when they return, given the counselling they need
and that those who will be leaving are properly demobilised. All of this is
part of our policy as this country, in which we make sure that we not only
train people militarily, but also give them the skills that they require
for civilian life.

Regarding the concern raised earlier by a member about the veterans, I just
want to take this opportunity to say it is not correct that the Minister of
Defence is not doing anything about the military veterans. The Minister has
announced that he has formed an advisory board and that he will soon be
announcing a united military veterans association. It is important that the
military veterans coming from different formations should also be
integrated just like our members. The different formations were integrated
into our regular force. Similarly, we are going to be integrating the
reserve force. So, I think, these are things that members should keep
themselves informed about rather than to come forward and make statements
without being fully briefed. [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, to the committees on Defence this debate is
not about whether Parliament supports the Burundi mission or not. Indeed,
we have unequivocally supported the mission because we are aware of the
political imperatives. But there are two issues I need to raise. The first
issue has to do with the finances, and the second issue with parliamentary
oversight. It is well and good for the Deputy Minister to tell us today
that moneys are going to be paid and so on, but the issue is that we want
that information before we come to the debate, not after the fact. That is
the problem.

Secondly, on the issue of parliamentary oversight, we feel strongly that we
have been undermined. We are the people's representatives. We have an
obligation to account to the people what the Government is doing. We have a
constitutional obligation as Parliament to ensure that oversight actually
takes place of the executive, and this is regardless of party affiliation
by the way, especially in the Defence committees.

We feel that on this Burundi mission, despite our initial support of the
mission, the executive failed dismally to take Parliament on board during
the decision-making process. I again repeat that we support the Burundi
mission. We have always supported it. There is no question about that, but
it is the issue of the relationship. Are we taken seriously enough to be
given information timeously, when we require it?

Having said that, however, I feel that the principle of parliamentary
oversight therefore is an important one and because of the seriousness I
place on this principle, I feel that on behalf of the ACDP I must abstain
in order to send a message to the Deputy Minister that we want her to take
us on board.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek dink daar is niemand wat kan sê
dat hy of sy teen vrede, stabiliteit en voorspoed in 'n ander land gekant
is nie. Dit is ook die standpunt van die VF. Ons wil graag vrede en
stabiliteit in Burundi sien. Die sprekers wat na vore tree, probeer die
indruk skep dat as mens hier steun sou gee, dat dit eintlik steun is vir
ons soldate wat daar is. Dit is nie die punt nie. Natuurlik steun ons ons
mense wat daar is.

Die vraag is: Steun ons die regering van die dag wat 'n bepaalde militêre
operasie in 'n ander land het, sodat hy dergelike operasie kan finansier?
Die VF se standpunt is eerstens: Wat van die ooreenkomste met die ander
lande, asook die EU? Hoekom is daar 'n vertraging met hierdie ooreenkomste?
Die standpunt van die VF is dat daardie ooreenkomste eers in plek moet
wees. As dit die geval is en ons is almal heeltemal verseker van hul
finansiële bydraes, dan kan ons ons steun toesê aan 'n verdere R130 miljoen
vir hierdie bepaalde militêre operasie.

Die sukses van 'n militêre operasie hang af van hoe deeglik hy beplan word
en hoe deeglik hy uitgevoer word. Hier sit ons met 'n finansiële aspek wat
nie deeglik beplan is nie en wat nie deeglik uitgevoer word nie. Verder,
wanneer gaan hierdie militêre operasie eindig? Ons vra nou geld vir die
2002-03 boekjaar. Wie sê dit gaan nie nog 'n jaar aanhou nie? Ons sal nie
hierdie wetsontwerp steun nie. Ons moet eers ons sake in orde kry, onsself
dissiplineer en dan sal die VF sy steun gee. (Translation of Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairman, I think that there is no one who can say
that he is opposed to peace, stability and progress in another country.
That is also the stand of the FF. We would like to see peace and stability
in Burundi. The speakers who came forward wanted to create the impression
that if one gave support here, then one actually supported our soldiers who
are there. That is not the point. Of course, we support our people there.

The question is: Do we support the government of the day that is conducting
a specific military operation in another country, so that it can finance
such an operation? The FF's stand is firstly: What about agreements with
other countries, and the EU? Why is there a delay with regard to these
agreements? The stand of the FF is that these agreements should first be in
place. If this is the case and we are all fully assured of their financial
contributions, then we can dedicate our support to the tune of a further
R130 million for this specific military operation.

The success of a military operation depends on how thoroughly it is planned
and how well it is executed. Here we have a financial aspect which has not
been thoroughly planned, which is not being thoroughly executed.
Furthermore, when will this military operation end? We are asking money for
the 2002-03 financial year now. Who says it is not going to last for
another year? We shall not support this Bill. We must first get our house
in order, discipline ourselves and then the FF will give its support.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, we all know the background that led to
the South African involvement in bringing about peace in Burundi. There is
no doubt that any effort that involves the sending of troops abroad is by
and large accompanied by cost implications and, naturally, taxpayers have
to provide for these expenses.

However, everything is not about money. We should view the involvement of
South Africa in Burundi as an investment in peace and development, as
opposed to its cost, because peace that is achieved in any part of Africa
adds value to the advancement of the continent, particularly for the
achievement of Nepad's objectives.

Above all, the peacekeeping mission in Burundi, as sanctioned by the UN,
should be viewed as an endorsement of South Africa's capabilities and
commitment to assist in bringing about a peaceful environment in Burundi.
This effort extends to all the people of Burundi, including their leaders,
and they will feel safe and secure as they pursue solutions for long-
lasting peace and stability in their efforts to create democratic
institutions.

We should also salute our peacekeeping forces in Burundi. Their sacrifices
are being noticed and highly appreciated. They should know that by being in
Burundi they are performing the task of protecting human lives, as they
would be expected to do in our country.

A word of appreciation should also go to Deputy President Zuma for the
important role he plays in building bridges for the warring factions in
Burundi. We support his endeavours, and hope God will give him strength and
wisdom to achieve this important mission.

It is for this noble reason that the UCDP supports the Burundi Protection
Support Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

Mr K A MOLOTO: Chairperson and hon members, South Africa has committed
itself to making a contribution to world peace. Human development thrives
only in peaceful conditions, whilst war results only in the unnecessary
destruction of the productive resources of any country, thus leaving
suffering and displacement of communities.

Children are the most vulnerable in any armed conflict. Therefore, it is
proper that we should contribute to laying the foundation for the peaceful
interaction of all citizens of Burundi. Given the facts presented before
the Portfolio Committee on Finance, the ANC is convinced that the
requirements of section 201(3) of the Constitution, and section 16 of the
Public Finance Management Act have been fulfilled.

Too much innocent blood has been shed. Let us draw wisdom from the biblical
beatitudes: ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the
sons of God.'' African lives are also precious. No amount of money could
equate to the lives of ordinary babies and the vulnerable. They have every
right to live in peace and reach adulthood. South Africa has the resources
and political will to contribute to the attainment of peace in Burundi. Let
us sow the seeds of peace in Burundi. May God richly bless South Africa and
find us righteous in His sight. The ANC supports the peace process and the
allocation of resources for its attainment. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, South Africa is a segment of a much larger
entity that is Africa. Thus we have duties towards the larger entity as a
stable Africa will contribute to a stable South Africa. The Burundi
situation needed intervention. The status of our former President Nelson
Mandela and our country's miraculous new democracy has placed global
confidence in the leadership, management and experience of South Africa.

This is a key factor contributing to the call for our assistance. The MF
supports the disbursement of the money appropriated for the Burundi
protection support. However, we must make every effort to ensure that other
role-players honour their commitment to contribute financially.  The
donations made by the European Union and the Belgium government are
encouraging. It is good news that South Africa's initiative is well
supported by the Burundi transitional government and army. The MF applauds
the South African efforts that not only serve to assist Burundi, but
contribute to building a good working relationship with other nations
involved, for example with regard to unity and security.

The idea has to be sold to the public to ensure a positive reaction and
understanding that assistance to the globe is a necessity in ensuring
stability in South Africa and economic growth on the African continent. The
MF supports the Burundi Protection Support Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

[Ms N F MATHIBELA: Mr Chairperson, I speak as an African woman who
understands hardship. The women of Africa know hardship, especially the
women who belong to the ANC. [Applause.] As I am standing here, I am making
an appeal that, as women of South Africa, we must support the establishment
of a democratic union of Africa. We know that we have suffered for many
years. The brunt of that suffering was directed at women.

When our Government talks about the Burundi conflict, we are reminded that
the Freedom Charter states that there will be peace, agreement and
friendship in the land. Every year, the President talks about the child,
saying that the African child must never suffer again. We regard the
children of Burundi as our children - the children of South Africa. We are
supporting the government of Burundi by sending our soldiers there to fight
against those who are against peace so that we may live in peace on this
continent of ours.

Friendship is desirable. South Africa is a country that has a recently
elected democratic Government. When we came into power, in 1994, we
undertook to co-operate with the neighbouring states in order to ensure our
mutual development. Africa belongs to all who live in it, and South Africa
is going to ensure that there is peace on this continent. We know how it
was during the days of war. We were brought up to believe that the man is
the breadwinner. When the men are out fighting the enemy, during times of
war, the people who bear the burden of looking after the children are the
women. Should those men die on the battlefield, the women do not have
anything with which to look after their children. That is why children run
away from home to seek help elsewhere. That is when they fall prey to con
men and criminals who promise them jobs which, they later realise, are not
real jobs but an introduction to prostitution.

As the women of the ANC, we are saying that wars have no positive outcomes
and they cannot build a nation. Wars destroy nations. We have confidence in
what our Government is doing currently, especially what Deputy President
Zuma is doing. May God be with him and bless him so that we may be able to
stop the wars that are raging on the African continent. Some people are
complaining about the amount of money that is being used in the attempt to
bring about peace in Burundi. Money is earned and spent, but a person who
dies at war does not come back.
We are helping African countries to develop and to revive their economies.
Therefore we, as the women of the ANC, are saying that we must continue to
support Burundi. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I would like to apologise to hon
members. Ms Nomvula Mathibela was delivering her maiden speech in the
National Assembly. Please applaud her. She spoke very well. [Applause.]

Die agb mnr Aucamp was 'n bietjie laat, maar ek gaan hom 'n kans gee om te
praat. [The hon Mr Aucamp was a bit late, but I am going to afford him an
opportunity to speak.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Agb Voorsitter, is dit nodig dat u dit moet invryf?

Op 12 Oktober 2001 is in Beeld berig dat Suid-Afrika na verwagting sowat 50
soldate bydra tot 'n mag van tussen 200 en 300 in Burundi. En verder:


  Suid-Afrika, Senegal, Ghana en Nigerië sal soldate bydra tot die mag en
  ook later tot 'n vredesmag. Die vredesmag sal eers ontplooi word as al
  die strydende partye in Burundi die vredesooreenkoms onderteken het en
  die VN 'n resolusie daaroor uitgevaardig het, het militêre bronne gister
  bevestig.

Kort daarna lees ons mnr Guy Verhofstadt, premier van België, het sowat R45
miljoen beskikbaar gestel vir die ontplooiing van die mag. Hy het
terselfdertyd onderneem om 'n verdere R153 miljoen van die Europese Unie te
kry om bykomende uitgawes te dek. Hiervan het dadels gekom. Hierdie
beloofde geld van die EU het nie gerealiseer nie, ook nie die soldate van
Senegal, Nigerië en Ghana nie. Is dit nie dalk 'n geval van ``fools rush in
where angels fear to tread'' nie?

Mnr Helmut Romer-Haitman, 'n kenner van Jane's Defence Weekly, het gesê dit
sal waansin wees om hulle te stuur as die strydende groepe hulle nog nie
tot 'n formele skietstilstand verbind het nie. Suid-Afrika se soldate sal
geen ondersteuning hê as hulle in die middel van die skietende strydendes
beland nie. Met die aankoms van die troepe in Burundi het die Tutsileier,
Mokatsi, gesê dat die Suid-Afrikaanse troepe indringers van buite is wat
beveg sal word. Dit is 'n duidelike bewys van die afwesigheid van 'n
aanvaarde vredesooreenkoms.

Die stuur van Suid-Afrikaanse troepe na Burundi was oorhaastig, ondeurdag
en nie in ooreenstemming met die Suid-Afrikaanse verklaarde beleid oor die
beskikbaarstelling van troepe in die buiteland nie. Daar kan nawetend gesê
word dat ons reg opgetree het en dat die soldate besig is om goeie werk te
doen. Dit is maar net genade en kon net sowel anders gewees het. Soos met
die Rassismekonferensie onttrek ander lande hul beloofde skenkings omdat
daar nie aan sekere basiese vereistes voldoen word nie en Suid-Afrika moet
alleen die gelag betaal. Daarom kan die AEB nie hierdie wetgewing steun
nie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, is it necessary that you should rub it in
like that?

On 12 October 2001 it was reported in Beeld that it is expected that South
Africa would contribute approximately 50 soldiers to a force of between 200
and 300 in Burundi. And further:


  Suid-Afrika, Senegal, Ghana en Nigerië sal soldate bydra tot die mag en
  ook later tot 'n vredesmag. Die vredesmag sal eers ontplooi word as al
  die strydende partye in Burundi die vredesooreenkoms onderteken het en
  die VN 'n resolusie daaroor uitgevaardig het, het militêre bronne gister
  bevestig.

Shortly thereafter we read that Mr Guy Verhofstadt, the Premier of Belgium,
made available approximately R45 million towards the deployment of this
force. At the same he undertook to obtain a further R153 million from the
European Union to cover additional costs. Nothing came of this. The
promised money from the EU did not materialise, neither did the soldiers
from Senegal, Nigeria and Ghana. Is this perhaps not a case of fools rush
in where angels fear to tread?

Mr Helmut Romer-Haitman, an authority from Jane's Defence Weekly, said that
it would be madness to send them in if the warring factions had not
committed themselves to a formal cease-fire. South Africa's soldiers would
have no support if they landed up in the middle of the shooting fighters.
With the arrival of the troops in Burundi the Tutsi leader, Mokatsi, said
that the South African troops were intruders from the outside who would be
fought. This is clear proof of the absence of an unacceptable peace
agreement.

The sending of South African troops to Burundi was overhasty, ill-
considered and not in accordance with the South African declared policy
about the supply of troops to foreign countries. With hindsight it could be
said that we acted fairly and that the soldiers are doing good work. This
is only by grace and could just as well have been otherwise. As with the
Racism Conference certain countries withdrew their promised donations,
because certain basic requirements were not complied with and South Africa
then has to foot the bill alone. For this reason the AEB cannot support
this legislation.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Mr Chairperson, again let me express my
appreciation to all those who have participated in the debate. The hon
Bekker used an analogy today. He said that we must get our ducks in a row.
Hon Bekker must please never use that analogy on a day that we are playing
cricket. [Laughter.] What we have to do here is to comply with section 201
of the Constitution and section 16(4) of the Public Finance Management Act.
I am satisfied that we are fully compliant.

It is important just to go back. After the death of the late Mwalimu
Nyerere, President Mandela was asked to lead the Arusha peace process.
Having achieved peace in Burundi, it was necessary to secure that peace. In
this regard, I am therefore quite dumbfounded by the approach of the hon
Groenewald, a military man down to his last hair, who would have us wait to
bed down that peace until everything is sorted out. One can never throw
away peace once one has secured it.
We had to act, and act correctly. I would like to submit to all members of
this House that, having considered all the issues at hand, we acted
timeously and dealt with the other issues. Similarly, if we had to wait
until all of the EU commitments ``put their money where their mouth is'',
we would not have secured peace in Burundi.

These circumstances have arisen given the exigencies of the need to secure
peace in Burundi. I ask that hon members understand it in that context.
Apropos the calculations of Dr Koornhof of R186 000 per soldier, I think
the Deputy Minister of Defence has dealt with that issue to a large extent.
The bulk of the expenditure was on transport. Planes, both large Antinovs
as well as Boeing 747s, had to be hired to get troops and equipment there.
That accounted for R74 million. The equipment and facilities for the troops
accounted for R19 million. So, that took a large chunk out of the money
already.

I want to assure members of this House that dealing with these kinds of
operations always creates uncertainties. I think if the hon Aucamp pulled
out the reports from Beeld and all the other newspapers he would have seen
that the figures were substantially higher. We are engaged with the
Ministry and the Secretary of Defence, Mr Grundling in particular, to work
continuously and diligently to ensure that the costs are reduced to the
bare minimum. This is our best estimate we have at this stage. This is what
we are asking Parliament to approve. We recognise the uncertainties, but I
want to ensure hon members that we are trying to live within the spirit of
both the Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act. We have come
here to ask for the approval of the appropriation. The appropriation must
be passed within 120 days of the announcement having been made, and we
trust that the circumstances are appreciated by all. [Applause.]

Bill read a second time.

                      SOCIAL GRANTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Mr F BHENGU: Mhlalingaphambili [Chairperson], Qhudeni [hon members], right
at the outset I want to commend the President and the Minister of Finance
for the allocation of R2 billion to resolve a very serious matter that
touches, to my mind, on a theme that the ANC highlighted as part of our
campaign directed towards poverty alleviation and clean and efficient
governance. I will also touch on how the themes of education, human rights,
and safety and security link up with our strategy plan for this year.

In terms of South African law, someone who is too sick to work, a woman who
has reached the age of 60 years or a man who has reached the age of 65
years, is entitled to a social grant provided by the state. In our
Constitution we also refer to the right of our people to have access to
social security and to have their social rights respected.

What happened, to an extent largely in the Eastern Cape, but certainly
across the country, is that beneficiaries who were entitled to social
grants did not receive them. Let us be clear about this: delays in payment,
as well as the effect of regulations introduced in 1977, resulted in severe
hardship for many poor households.

We have changed the problematic regulations. From 1 December 2001 a
beneficiary is eligible for payment of the grant from the day of approval.
What we have learnt as governing party is that we cannot allow
administrative inefficiencies to stand in the way of our people claiming
their rights. So, we have to ensure that those officials in Government
departments who are unwilling really to serve our people are weeded out.

I want to echo the sentiments of the President, in his state of the nation
address, when he said: ``Payment for honest work is more fulfilling and
sustainable than theft.'' We must, in the Public Service, be driven by the
principle of Batho Pele, ``people first''. This means that where there are
problems in accessing a grant because of officials in the Department of
Home Affairs being unable to provide that person with an ID or where the
application of a disabled person is being blocked by the relevant health
authorities, those officials must be removed or re-educated so that they
understand and commit to the principles of Batho Pele.
In the Department of Social Development, in the Eastern Cape alone, ten
officials have already been found guilty of fraud and corruption, and they
have been removed from their posts. The cost of that corruption to
Government was more than R10 million. This we cannot tolerate.

In that province an internal fraud unit has been set up to ensure that this
practice is stopped. In addition, it has set up multidisciplinary
committees consisting of, among others, the SAPS, the banks and the office
of the Attorney-General, in order to co-ordinate all fraud cases in which
departmental officials are involved.

This is what we mean when we say, ``stand up and act''. The Eastern Cape
province has also started monitoring transactions at pay points, thus
eliminating a large proportion of discrepancies in the payment of grants.
We encourage the province to continue with these processes and to report
the progress that they are making with regard to rooting out inefficiency
and corruption.

We further commend the province in their efforts to process the back
payment of grants in an orderly and efficient manner, and we also encourage
those persons who were affected by class action to come forward with all
their information and documentation, so as to assist the department in this
process.
The province has established that more than 2 300 beneficiaries cannot be
traced. Because of this, we call on communities to assist in getting the
information of the back payment of grants out to all relevant persons, so
that bona fide beneficiaries can now get what is rightfully theirs.

We welcome the allocation in the budget of the Department of Social
Development that focuses especially on the training of social security
personnel in all the provinces, as well as the introduction of norms and
standards for social security delivery.

We as parliamentarians must, through our constituency offices, also play
our role in keeping an eye on the level of service delivery, and where
there are problems, bring this to the attention of the relevant department.
This we must do in the spirit of Vukuzenzele.

And so we say that in this month of human rights, as a starting point, let
us be aware of the fact that Government respects the right of older
persons, the disabled, and the poorest of our children to receive social
grants. Old age and disability grants, for example, have been increased
from R390,00 in 1994 to R620,00 this year. In addition the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework makes provision for further increases over the medium
term that will be above the level of inflation.

Let us educate our communities about their responsibility not to allow the
abuse of these grants once Government has paid them. We must not allow
beneficiaries to fall prey to unscrupulous money lenders and confidence
tricksters, who now see the opportunity to make a lot of money. The
provinces will have to be clear about the manner in which money will be
paid out and I want to commend those provinces that have already put on the
table their strategy to deal with these payments.

Once the process is clear, let us play a role in ensuring that we identify
all those persons in our constituencies and communities who are eligible
for back payment, and let us then assist in making sure that they
understand how payments will take place and what amounts are due to them.
Let us speak out publicly against abuse and corruption so that we
collectively raise consciousness about how we want to see the process
unfold. In this way we will be contributing in enabling beneficiaries to
access their rights in a safe and secure manner.

I have already heard this includes ... abameli mntwanenkosi, amagqwetha ...
[... lawyers Chairperson, lawyers ...]

... about groups of people in some of the provinces who are preparing
themselves for attempts to defraud Government and the rest of society, by
applying for back payment of grants, when in fact they are not eligible for
this. We as communities must be vigilant and educate ourselves about what
is morally the right thing to do.

Le nto mntwanenkosi yenzeka phaya kwelaa phondo sikulo, apho sidibana khona
nala magqwetha encedisana naba bantu bangenamqolo, oorhoxotyeni. [This,
Chairperson, happens in our province, where we get to meet these lawyers
helping these crooks.]

We must also be mindful that in many cases the aged beneficiaries are not
able to access the full grant amount, because they are being harassed,
intimidated and abused by greedy relatives. We understand that the grant is
a lifeline for whole families, but we can never let it become an excuse for
people to rob their elderly relatives of what is a right in terms of South
African law. Therefore, when older persons are given the responsibility of
caring for grandchildren, we call on schools to ascertain whether the
parents support those grandchildren or whether they are dependent on the
old age grant. In such cases schools must make sure that they do not take
school fees out of an old age grant, but rather find other ways of fully
subsidising the learners. This is especially the case where children have
been orphaned by HIV/Aids and where there simply are no parents to take
care of their children.

The impact of HIV/Aids is already placing a heavy burden on our elderly
generation. Let us provide that basket of services - health services,
education and social security - in a manner that is sensitive to the
reality of our people's lives.

Lastly, we also learnt with shock that last year thousands of beneficiaries
were forced to pay a commission on the cashing of social security cheques.
This is unacceptable and one may expect that the larger the amount, the
larger the deduction. I believe that we should be very clear about the fact
that no matter what the payment system provided by the provincial
government and preferred by the beneficiaries, shortcomings and
administrative capacity must not disadvantage beneficiaries in this manner.

We support negotiations with the financial sector that are aimed at finding
ways in which beneficiaries will be able to access their grants via bank
accounts without the burden of paying expensive banking fees. We should
also encourage the re-establishment of the Post Bank as a payment agency
and ensure that post office agencies are brought to the people rather than
being closed in the rural areas, as has been the case in some provinces.

Mandigqibezele mntane'nkosi. [Let me finish, Chairperson.] Let us not fall
into the trap of lambasting all public servants. There are those dedicated
and committed ones who work long hours under difficult circumstances, and
there are also many volunteers who are assisting in this process.
[Applause.]

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Chairperson, the Democratic Alliance is extremely pleased
to see this Bill being enacted.

This Bill takes a first, but crucial, step in finally settling a period of
untold hardship for many social grant beneficiaries that is a result of the
disastrous re-registration process. Therefore, the DA is pleased to be able
finally to support this Bill.

It is, however, distressing to note that after having to deal with the
traumatic consequences of the incredibly insensitive and cruel
mismanagement of the re-registration process, it took a court ruling for
the state to make good its obligations to some of the most vulnerable in
our society. This in itself speaks volumes about the real commitment on the
part of many public servants in the fight against poverty.

This entire episode further demonstrates the need to review the entire
means test system. A large number of the irregularities which the re-
registration process sought to rectify emanated from the opportunities the
means test regulations provided for crooked officials to defraud the
department.

I hope that this experience will refocus the state on the prime function of
a social security system, namely to protect vulnerable members of society
from destitution, and in contrast to the current attitude of merely
complying with bureaucratic rules and regulations, the poor application of
which caused the problems in the first place. But before the intended
beneficiaries of this Bill can celebrate, there are a few issues that
remain to ensure that the funds reach the intended targets.

Although the funds will be disbursed to the provinces by way of conditional
grants, special heed needs to be taken to guarantee that these funds fulfil
the expectations of the High Court ruling. These funds cannot be used to
top up provincial social development budgets, thereby freeing up money to
be released in other departments in the provinces.

Further, in order to survive during this traumatic period and in
anticipation of full payback, many beneficiaries ran up high debts. Of
these many have since passed away, more often than not leaving their
estates to poverty-trapped relatives with the burden of repayment.

This raises the question as to whether moneys to which beneficiaries in
such cases are entitled, in terms of the High Court ruling, will be made
available to those who now suffer the burden of these debts. This is a
crucial question, since social grants do not form part of a deceased
person's estate.

At this juncture I must point out that this Bill should not only seek to
right wrongs, but also seek to lighten that burden which is the ultimate
result of the horrible bungling on the part of the state. It therefore
becomes insufficient for the Bill merely to make the money available. The
Department of Social Development must take the appropriate steps to ensure
justice in this regard.

It is my and my party's sincere hope that this Bill will finally put to
rest the terrible experience of thousands of beneficiaries, and put us in a
position in which we can sincerely say, ``never again''. The DP supports
the Bill.

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Chairman, when a mother applies for a child grant or when
a person in desperate need applies for a grant from Government, he or she
does expect a response in a reasonable time. We all know about the delays
and the unacceptably long waiting periods before approval is given.

The High Court has correctly ruled that the needy and the indigent cannot
be punished and penalised for the delays in administration and that this
grant should be paid retrospectively from application.

The IFP welcomes this ruling, and we are grateful that those entitled to
grants will receive this extra windfall. This is a very large amount, being
in excess of R2 billion, and it will have to be disbursed in a relatively
short period.

We also know that this is a once-off expenditure, and that it is not going
to be repeated. The IFP is therefore concerned about the capability of
Government and particularly of provinces to see to it that these moneys end
up in the correct pockets. Caution must be taken that we do not open up an
opportunity for corruption of officials.

May I then say, just in passing, with regard to the hon Bhengu, that from
our side we do not believe that the corrupt official can be re-educated.
There is only one way for that person, and that is out.

With these cautionary words, the IFP will support the Bill.

Mr N M NENE: Chairperson, hon members, in the state of the nation address
the President made a commitment to the beneficiaries of social grants that
whatever inequities they have been victims of in terms of their pension
payments, the ANC Government will make good. The Minister of Finance did
the same in his Budget speech, and today we give effect to these
commitments.
I want to remind the hon member Da Camara that what we are addressing today
is not the making of the ANC as Government. We are, however, repealing an
Act of Parliament of 1992.

This Bill provides for R2 billion to be allocated to the national
Department of Social Development to enable it to dispose of the matter
without further delay. Approximately 1,8 million poor people are going to
benefit from these arrear payments.

These arrears developed because of the inequitable regulations in terms of
which beneficiaries were paid from the date of approval, and not from the
date of application and the date on which they qualified. That legislation
has since been amended to allow the beneficiaries to be paid from the date
of application if they qualified. The hon member Bhengu has elaborated on
this. This additional allocation will be made available to all nine
provinces as determined by, and in terms of the conditions imposed on, the
Division of Revenue Act of 2001.

I also want to assure the hon member that the wishes of his party, the DA
or the DP, will also be met, because regarding those people that have
passed away - if one looks at the categories - about R220 million has been
allocated to 96 cases, amongst which are lapsed cases, those  of people who
have passed on.

There are also active members. An amount of R1,7 billion has been provided
for 1,8 million beneficiaries, the majority of whom are in the highly
impoverished provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and the Northern
Province. There are also suspended members. An amount of R43 million has
been allocated to 16 000 such cases, and the administration costs are
estimated at R33 million.

The information that will be used to determine the legitimate beneficiaries
is available through Socpen, the social pension system, and we trust that
this information is reliable and can be relied on as a starting point.
There are, however, a number of related problems, some of which hon members
have raised, with regard to the payment of social grants ranging from lack
of infrastructure, to unscrupulous financial institutions, which are
effecting stop orders on pensioners' grants, some even without the consent
of the beneficiaries. These matters are receiving the attention of the
department and will need to be resolved so that the poor do not lose out at
the end of the process.

The level of take-up varies from province to province and every effort is
being made to ensure that all eligible beneficiaries are brought into the
net.

The department has also established a commission to look into the entire
social security system in order to address the poverty crisis in a more
holistic way. Once this report has been completed, its recommendations will
be considered. We look forward to this report, but whilst we are waiting
for it, we need to ensure that the take-up is improved to include all
eligible beneficiaries.

Let me take this opportunity to call upon all members to mobilise our
community structures, churches and community-based organisations to arise
and act to ensure that beneficiaries get what is rightfully theirs. The ANC
supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The TEMPORARY CHAIRPERSON (Mr A Mlangeni): Good morning, all of you.
[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Chairperson, allow me to congratulate you. Indeed it is an
honour and a privilege to address the honourable House when you are in the
Chair.

The Social Grants Appropriation Bill relates to beneficiaries who became
part of the system between 1 April and now. The cost estimates of this Bill
are as follows: Active cases - R1,7 billion; lapsed cases - R22 million,
which refers to 96 cases; suspended cases - R43 million; and the
administrative cost of this grant will be R33 million. The money allocated
will flow as a conditional grant to the provinces before the end of this
financial year.

These funds will alleviate the plight of the poor. It appears that the
income situation of millions of South Africans has deteriorated in the past
12 months. A recent study conducted by Mike Sampson, which was submitted to
the Portfolio Committee on Finance, found that 26,9 million people had been
estimated to live below the absolute poverty line, defined as R400 per
adult in a household in this country. Of this 26,9 million live below the
absolute poverty line, 10,4 million live in ultra-poor households. What the
report found, and what is rather perturbing, is that many of the adults in
these households earn less than R193 per month.

In the 2002-03 Budget the social pension was increased to R620 per month
and the child support grant rose to R130 per month, which is commendable.

What is of concern, however, is that today the costs of administering
grants, pensions and so forth, have become fairly high. I think we have to
look at this again. Welfare agencies have also expressed concern at the
number of children that are being abandoned once they are no longer
eligible for child grants. A possible solution is that we extend the child
support grant beyond the age of seven. Social pensions and social support
grants are recognised as key factors regarding the alleviation of poverty.
The New NP supports this Bill.

Om saam te vat: Armoede is vandag werklikwaar een van die verskynsels wat
haas elke persoon in hierdie land beïnvloed. Dit is gebiedend noodsaaklik
dat ons alle moontlike rolspelers betrek om hierdie probleem te bestry wat
verreikende maatskaplike gevolge vir ons inhou. 'n Ekonomie en 'n
samelewing kan nie vooruitgaan as daar nie voldoende voorsiening gemaak
word vir die verligting van armoede nie. Daarvolgens doen ons ook 'n
beroep, nie alleen op die openbare sektor nie, maar ook op die
privaatsektor. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[To summarise: Poverty today is, indeed one of the phenomenons that affects
almost every person in this country. It is urgently necessary that we
involve all possible role-players in order to combat this problem which may
have far-reaching social consequences for us. An economy and a society
cannot prosper if adequate provision is not made for the relief of poverty.
Therefore, we are also making an appeal not only to the public sector, but
also to the private sector. [Applause.]]
Mr G W KOORNHOF: Mr Mlangeni, I am happy to see you in the Chair and I know
that you will be as good a Chairperson as you are an excellent golfer.
[Laughter.]

We welcome the statement by both the President and the Minister of Finance
that administrative failures and weaknesses in legislation and regulations
cannot and will not be tolerated. Such failures and weaknesses have a
detrimental effect on many South Africans, especially the poor, with
respect to service delivery. In addition, it causes budgetary uncertainty
for different spheres of government.

We commend the trustees of the Black Sash who brought a court action
against the Minister of Social Development and won it based on unfair
regulations. It confirms the important role that civil society can play and
must play to make sure that service delivery is fair and appropriate.

This Bill ensures that more than 1,8 million beneficiaries will receive
what is due to them. The majority of these beneficiaries are children and
old people, and reside in the provinces of the Eastern Cape, the Northern
Province and KwaZulu-Natal.

Three important aspects now come into play regarding this Bill. Firstly,
the administrative capacity of provinces to handle this additional burden
must be strengthened. We want to put on record that this capacity-building
process, for which R33 million has been budgeted for administration, should
not be misused by only empowering party-political functionaries to
administer the payout of these arrear payments in various provinces.

Secondly, the Department of Social Development should monitor this process
of successful implementation with a hands-on approach. It has been alleged
recently that problems with service delivery may in many instances be
attributed to public officials refusing to make payments instituted by
court orders, regulation or legislation. We should not allow this to
happen, especially with the paying of arrears of social grants. Public
servants should do their job properly. I fully associate myself with the
sentiments expressed by Mr Bhengu earlier in this debate.

Thirdly, every effort should be made to keep to the indicated time frame
for this process to be completed before the end of this calender year, but
at least within the 2002-2003 financial year.

The UDM supports the Social Grants Appropriation Bill and hopes that the
implementation process will be effective, so that beneficiaries, especially
old people and children, qualify for this grant and will benefit.
[Applause.]

Mr J H NASH: Chairperson, poor hon Da Camara starts off his speech as a
member of the DP and ends his speech a member of the DA - that confused
party once again. They do not know whether they are coming or going. Poor
chaps! [Laughter.] They must please make up their minds. Read my lips:
there is no DA in this Parliament. They must get it right the first time.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

As for the member making a noise here, he sits here with a document of the
DA. There is no DA here. Read my lips. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

It is a real honour to take part in this debate today. Why are we debating?
It is because we are carrying out a mandate spelt out by our President in
his state of the nation address. President Mbeki is a people's President.
He sent us out to speak to our voters and to listen. During the President's
recent visits to all parts of the country he heard the pleas of our people,
pensioners and the poor, and so he requested our Minister of Finance,
Comrade Dr Minister Manuel ... The Minister must please not get any more
honorary doctorates; he can see what a long title he already has. It is
because he is passionate to help those who are less privileged in our
country.

Today I want to address those public servants whose daily task it is to
serve the poor. Here I want to stress that the officials in welfare,
health, the police and the courts are trying their best to follow the Batho
Pele, ``people first'' policy. But in the basket of good apples there are
officials who thrive on being over-officious, and those who abuse people
because they have so-called power. Every day we get complaints from people
who have waited for long periods and have still not received their pensions
or grants. Some have been waiting for more than a year, or even longer.
Some have had their grants taken away and they do not know why this has
happened.

An appointment was made by a lady from Molteno to go to East London for
treatment. This meant that she had to get up at 3 am in the morning to meet
the ambulance at 5 am, and travel three hours to East London, only to be
told that she had to come back the next month because the doctor was not
available. The medicine was not available that day. So the poor old lady
had to wait until the next week when the ambulance driver would collect the
medicine for her. That meant seven days of pain and suffering!
[Interjections.]
Every day one hears of people who come for their pensions only to be told,
when they get to the office, that there was no money for them. What did the
frail old person have to do to get to the pay point? He or she had to get
up at 3 am or 4 am, walk to the bus stop, travel 30 km to the nearest pay
point, wait in a long queue to be seen, only to be told to come back the
next month.

Officials are impatient with these old people. They do not even take the
trouble to go outside, to see which people are old and frail and take them
to a separate queue and deal with them speedily. In the cold, rainy and
windy weather these old pensioners have to wait. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Where is Stofile?

Mr J H NASH: Where is the spirit of ``Batho Pele''? Where is the
compassion? This is what we have to inculcate in our officials, to think of
what they are doing.

The hon member is asking where Stofile is. What is he doing in the northern
suburbs of Port Elizabeth? Must I tell him? Nothing! [Interjections.] It is
not only Stofile that must be doing something, he, as a member there, must
do something. He must go out to the people and help them to fill in their
pension forms.

An HON MEMBER: He does not go home!

Mr J H NASH: He does not go home, yes, the hon member is right there.
[Interjections.] This is what we have to inculcate. The public servants
should think of the frustration they are causing. They should help their
people. When a doctor is confronted with a man or woman who has lost both
legs, whose hands are twisted and shrivelled with arthritis, the doctor
should not say that this person is fit to work and should go home. The
doctor should help that person, fill in that form. [Time expired.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Chairperson and Minister, Mr Nash gave us a very
passionate report which is very factual, and I want to commend him on it
because that is the reality out there in our communities. I want to say
that I am very pleased to say that the ACDP supports the President, Mr
Mbeki, on the firm position that he has taken on dealing with public
servants who do not fulfil their function and perform their duties. So,
thank you very much, Mr President.

I would like to say that our children's human development is a grave
concern. Without the proper social infrastructure, our youngsters and our
elderly struggle to live a normal life. Unemployment among parents is a key
factor that robs our youth of prolonged schooling opportunities, as they
need to work at an early age to support the family. The luxury of a basic
living standard is difficult to comprehend, because in many instances
families rely on the grant that a family member receives from the
Government. Many people have waited for a year or two and have not received
anything. It is very sad when one goes to the community and one hears of
people who have to go to bed without food. It is incomprehensible and
unacceptable.

Government has, in the current financial year, made a once-off conditional
grant of R2 billion towards poverty relief. Provincial departments will be
able immediately to gain access to their funds for distribution to those
who, as a result of regulation, have suffered from inequitable grant
payments, as well as ineffective and inefficient service delivery. I would
like to thank the Minister for that R2 billion. I know it is going to be
used wisely, but the Minister should please work on the department to see
that this actualy gets through to the people who need it most. The ACDP
supports the Social Grants Appropriation Bill.

[Mrs M A SEECO: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the UCDP I wish to thank the
national Minister of Finance for the Budget allocation of the Department of
Social Services. We also noted that the other departments' budgets were
also increased. We accept that, as members of one family, we have to share
what we have.

The department's intention is to help the disabled, the elderly, children
and babies, more especially indigent children and orphans. We all know that
there is a lot of joblessness and poverty, therefore this department has to
come to the nation's rescue. This budget will, in particular, develop our
future leaders and presidents.

With that in mind, we urge that this department's allocation be increased.
This would make our work - particularly that of us, the mothers in this
poverty-stricken nation, as demonstrated above - lighter. We appeal to the
House to rule that the department be given more funds.

The Motswana of yesteryear said: ``You can deny me food, as long as you
feed my child''. The UDM says that the Batho Pele principle should be
promoted by granting the department this R2 billion increase, to enable it
to work for the nation.

Forward, Batho Pele [People First], forward!]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, I take this opportunity to congratulate you. I
believe it has been a long walk from the chains to the chair.

The PAC supports this Bill, particularly its once-off retrospective effect.
We believe that the Minister has done very well in looking after this
section of our community. I would only encourage the Minister to do more,
because I believe that the minimum that people get in social grants can be
increased. I think the Minister wants to increase this amount, and I want
to encourage him to move in the direction of increasing it at every
opportunity he has.

We believe that the question of social grants is a question that is very
important for our communities, particularly the way in which the people
receive their grants. I think we should do more to ensure that the areas
where they receive their grants are improved and actually made very
comfortable. This is not just a question of economic need, but a question
of dignity, a question of affirming these people, because they need
affirmation.

Many people travel long distances, sometimes in the rain, and wake up very
early in the morning to leave. Sometimes the officials are a bit too
officious in the way they treat the people. I believe that we must attend
to this section. We must move to a banking system, so that it can help this
community better than it is doing now, although the banks themselves are a
problem. There are too many long queues there too.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRPERSON (Mr A Mlangeni): Order! Your time has expired, Dr
Mogoba.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, I would like to congratulate you and say that
the PAC supports this Bill.

Mnu J Z KATI: Mhlalingaphembili nentlangano yonke iphelele elapha
ePalamente, ndincoma ikakhulu umsebenzi owenziwe ngunondyebo, ndincome
nomsebenzi kaMongameli kunye nabantu asebenza kunye nabo. Ukuba

ndifuna ukuthi, kuyo yonke into eyenzekayo, sizinikiwe iintonga ngoku
zimbini. Siyahamba siya ebantwini siyakulwa, siyakubaxelela ukuba nabu
ubutyebi size nabo.

Ndisafika kwesi sihlalo ndikuso, andifuni kuthetha kakhulu, ndakuthi kanti
sendisona. I-ANC iyawamkela lo Mthetho uYilwayo. Bekunga kunganjalo
naninina, de kuye nakweminye imithetho eza kuthi ize nemali. Sifuna enye.
Mayingapheleli kule. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa speech

[Mr J Z KATI: Chairperson and the whole membership gathered here in
Parliament, I would like to congratulate mostly the work of the hon
Minister of Finance and that of the President and their teams. If they did
not work as a team, it would mean that the hon the President's plan would
not have succeeded. The reason it succeeded was because of the people that
he works very well with; they share the same ideas. That makes it easy then
to reach a decision. The role that the hon Minister of Finance and the
President played was very significant.

In the rural areas it is painful. Apparently in certain homes people go to
sleep without food. Today I think that the hon the President and the hon
the Minister of Finance have empowered us so that we could go to the people
and tell them that we are bringing the wealth that we said we wanted to be
shared amongst people. [Applause.] Therefore, that is our job. That is why
we say that we should go to our constituencies and tell the people. Our
offices are often filled with people who would like to be helped. They are
demanding the right that is not granted to them.

By this I am trying to say hon Members, that there is so much difficulty
there because often a person would be registered but payment would not be
forthcoming, and for a very long time the person would come to us, the
leaders. It is difficult for us too sometimes, as we would not be helped.
Sometimes you would go (as a leader) to lay a complaint in support of that
person, and you would not get assistance. Through the steps taken by the
hon the President and the hon the Minister of Finance, I wish that the
money could follow and hopefully a report would be submitted which would
state what the money was spent on. Fat cats please step aside. I am asking
the people who like filling their pockets up to wait and step aside; the
money must go to the people. I want to say that we feel empowered now and
we are ready to take up work. We are going to the people to fight, we are
going to tell them that we have brought wealth. I am new in this portfolio.
I do not want to say much in case I make mistakes. The ANC welcomes this
Bill. I wish it would be like this at all times and with all the other laws
that will bring money. We want more. This should not be the last.
[Applause.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF views the problem of disbursement of
moneys in this department as a serious one. As the efficient disbursement
of social grants is of paramount importance, taking into account the harsh
realities of poverty, we need to learn from this experience.

The department must ensure that timeframes are set and adhered to
rigorously by the provinces. And the provinces, in turn, have to ensure
that the backdated funds reach the intended beneficiaries as soon as
possible to alleviate suffering and discontent.

The MF does not stand here to criticise the department, as we are all aware
of the department's achievements and the difficulties it encounters in
doing so. However, an excuse may not serve to cushion the harsh
predicaments encountered by beneficiaries because of this backlog. This has
been damaging the visibility of the success of our Government.
Beneficiaries need to be informed that these are not handouts and that
there is a genuine concern for their wellbeing and a serious commitment by
our Government, and that the department is taking steps in this situation.

The MF welcomes and applauds the Government and the Minister of Finance for
setting aside R2 billion for payment of grants in arrears.  A serious look
at the department's infrastructure should be taken so as to find what
hampers the performance of the department. The MF supports the Social
Grants Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

The TEMPORARY CHAIRPERSON (Mr A Mlangeni): Order! Hon members, I have just
been informed that the hon Kati was making his maiden speech. I was not
informed before he gave his speech. So, we wish to congratulate you, Mr
Kati, on your wonderful speech. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb ``Adjunk-Adjunkspeaker'', hierdie wetgewing, waarvolgens
daar bykomend R2 miljard uit die sentrale Begroting aan die provinsies
beskikbaar gestel word vir terugwerkende betaling van maatskaplike
pensioene en toelaes van 1,8 miljoen mense, word deur die AEB ondersteun en
verwelkom. Hiermee erken ons ons verpligting teenoor individue wat van
April 1998 tot Desember verlede jaar vir die eerste keer vir toelaes
gekwalifiseer het, maar uitbetalings eers later of glad nie ontvang het
nie.

Hierdie agterstand in die betaling het by die provinsies opgehoop weens die
lang tydsverloop tussen die wettige aansoek en die inwerkingtreding van die
maandelikse uitbetalings. Ons mag nie toelaat dat die kwesbares en die
weerloses ly as gevolg van administratiewe onbeholpenheid nie. Hierdie is
die regte ding om te doen en ons het geen keuse nie.
Die AEB betreur egter die feit dat administratiewe rompslomp en
onbeholpenheid hierdie agterstallige bedrag veroorsaak het. Ons moet ook in
gedagte hou dat maatskaplike pensioene aangewend word vir daaglikse
oorlewing deur die ontvangers daarvan. Lang wagperiodes bring onvermydelik
groot ongerief en ontbering mee vir hulle wat daarop geregtig is. Dit het
baie arm huishoudings swaar getref. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon ``Deputy Deputy'' Speaker, the AEB supports and welcomes
this legislation, in terms of which an additional R2 billion from the
central Budget is made available for the backdated payment of social
pensions and grants of 1,8 million people. We hereby acknowledge our
obligation to individuals who, from April 1998 until December of last year,
qualified for the first time for grants, but who only received payments
later on or not at all.

This backlog in payments accumulated with the provinces because of the long
period between the legal application and the commencement of the monthly
payments. We may not allow the vulnerable and defenceless to suffer because
of administrative ineptness. This is the right thing to do and we have no
choice.

The AEB, however, deplores the fact that administrative red tape and
ineptness have caused this backlog. We must also keep in mind that social
pensions are being utilised for daily survival by their recipients. Long
periods of waiting inevitably bring on great discomfort and hardship to
those who are entitled to them. This has hit many of the poor households
very hard.]

We must remember that backpay cannot stand in for last year's hunger or
last winter's cold.

Administratiewe masjinerie moet onverwyld in orde gekry word om sodanige
ongerief asook sulke abnormale uitgawes in die toekoms te voorkom. Die AEB
wil drie dringende vrae aan die Minister stel: Watter maatreëls word getref
om hierdie vertragings te voorkom? Hoe ver het die Departement van
Bevolkingsontwikkeling gevorder met die vaartbelyning van die uitbetaling
van maatskaplike pensioene? Watter maatreëls word getref om te verhoed dat
die Regering se tweede span, naamlik die provinsies, en sy derde span, die
munisipaliteite, die beste pogings van sy eerste span oorskadu en in die
wiele ry?

Die AEB steun hierdie wetgewing. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[The administrative machinery must be fixed up at once in order to avoid
such discomfort as well as such abnormal expenditure in future. The AEB
would like to pose three urgent questions to the Minister: What precautions
are being taken in order to avoid such delays? How far has the Department
of Population Development progressed with streamlining the social pension
payouts? What measures are being taken to prevent the Government's second
team, namely the provinces, and its third team, the municipalities, from
outclassing the best efforts of their first team by putting a spoke in
their wheel?

The AEB supports this legislation.]

Mrs B M NTULI: Chairperson, hon members and Ministers, Batho Pele! The
Social Grants Appropriation Bill is a Bill that is going to change the
lives of our old people in the rural areas. It is going to transform their
lives because they are going to be able to put bread on the table, buy
clothes to cover their bodies and buy blankets to cover themselves in
winter. This is how committed this Government is, the Government of the
people. This is an indication that the ANC-led Government cares for the
aged. This is, indeed, a very brave step.

Lokhu kuyakhombisa ukuthi umbuso kaKhongolose uzimisele kangakanani ukwenza
impilo yabo bonke abantu ibe ngcono. Le-R2 billion iyokwenza lokho nje
kuphela. [This shows how determined the ANC Government is to improve the
lives of all people. This R2 billion will be used for that purpose only.] A
country that is not able to take care of its elderly people is a crazy
country.

Ake ngithi ukucaphuna kulokho obekwenzeka esikhathini esiphambili.
Esikhathini esiphambili laba bantu abadala bebesebenza kololiwe, sasisho
njalo kulesiya sikhathi. Babesebenza kungabantu abamhlophe nabantu
abamnyama. Bekuthi uma sebebadala sebephuma impesheni laba abamhlophe
bekuba nemali ebekwa eceleni abazokhokhelwa yona, kukhokhelwe namakhosikazi
abo kuze kukhokhelwe ngisho nabantwana babo uma bona sebefile. Kulaba
bakithi kwakuthiwa nje ``baie dankie'' abeseyahamba ayohlala ekhaya, ancele
izithupha adle imbuya ngothi.

Omama bethu laba ababesebenza emakhishini, bepholisha izitubhi ezinde
eziyophuma ngesango, laba asebebulawa ngamadolo namhlanje, abangakwazi
ukusukuma namhlanje, bebethi uma sebephuma kulo msebenzi sebegugile,
bashaywe emahlombe kuthiwe ``baie dankie.'' Bebedla u`` u-baie dankie''
bona uma befika ekhaya. Lona-ke ohleli esihlalweni ophethe umkhilosho
ongakaze enze lutho, ubeye ahole imali yendoda yakhe ephuma kwaloliwe,
eyoze idliwe nayizizukulu zakhe.

Lo mThetho uzosiza ukulungisa khona lokho okonakala ekuqaleni. Bekonakele,
kuzolungiswa-ke manje. Nabo laba abasemakhaya bazophumelela ukuthola okuya
ngasethunjini, baphumelele ukujabula. Kanti labo mama basemakhaya uma
sebethole le mali izokwenza impilo yabo ibe ngcono. Phela labo mama ngomama
bomthandazo, bayanikela nasemasontweni. Sengathi sengiyababona uma
sebehlabelela bethi: (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Let me refer to what used to happen in the past. Older people used to work
for the railways. That is what we called it at that time. They worked as
white and black people. When they got old and it was time for them to
retire, the whites used to get money that was put aside for them. That
money used to be paid to their wives and even their children when they
passed away. To the blacks the employers used to say ``baie dankie'' and
the person went home and starved.

Our mothers, who used to work in the kitchens and clean the long stoeps
that end at the gates, are the ones that are experiencing knee pains these
days; they cannot stand up today. When they retired because of old age,
they would be patted on the shoulders, and they would be told ``baie
dankie''. They ate ``baie dankie'' when they got home. The person who used
to sit on a chair and do the crocheting the one who did nothing, continued
to earn her husband's salary from the railways, the money that would also
be received by her grandchildren.

This Bill will help to correct those mistakes of the past. It was wrong,
and now it is going to be corrected. Even those who are at home will get
something to eat; they will succeed and be happy. As for the women at home,
once they have received this money, their lives will improve. These women
are women of prayer, they make donations in church. It is as if I see them
when they sing: ``Kganthe Jesu o na mpona ha ke lla jwalo''. [``And Jesus
heard my cry''.]]

... sebesa umnikelo wabo beyobonga uNkulunkulu ngalokho akwenziwe.

Siyabonga kuNgqongqoshe ngezandla zombili. Sithi, halala! Kuhle lokhu
akwenzele abantu bakithi. Bazophumelela futhi ukukhokhela omasingcwabisane
babo. Izophela le ndaba yokuthi uma eselele umuntu omdala ingabi bikho
imali yokumngcwaba. Siyabonga kuNgqongqoshe sithi phambili ngalo msebenzi
omuhle kangaka awenzile! Lokhu esikwenza namhlanje kuzoguqula izimpilo
zogogo emakhaya. Bazokwazi nokuya esibhedlela, banakekele impilo yabo kanye
nokudla abakudlayo futhi badle kangcono.

Ngithe ake ngithinte ngale ndaba yalapho abaholelwa khona. Akunamithunzi
lapho abahlala khona, akunazindawo zokukhosela noma imvula ina banethwa
izimvula, kanti uma ilanga lishisa bashiswa yilanga. Akunazindawo
zokuzikhulula laphaya futhi akunamanzi. Sicela ukuthi nalokho kulungiswe
ukuze kuthi lapho bekuleziya zindawo bakwazi ukuhlala ngokukhululeka kube
mnandi.

Ngizozama ukugcina ngalokhu. Ake sizame ukuziphucula lezi zindawo,
siphucule nendlela abantu abahanjiswa ngayo uma beyohola impesheni.
Kwesinye isikhathi uyaye uthole laba abagula kakhulu sebeqhutshwa
ngamabhala uma besiwa lapho abaholela khona. Bekungaphuculwa lokho ngokuthi
mhlawumbe asayinelwe kube khona nalo muntu ozomnakekela noma kube
nesithuthi esizobathutha sibahambise lapho futhi bangabi selayinini omude
ukuze bezothola imali yabo masinyane.

UNgqongqoshe wezimali uthe: (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[They are making donations, they are saying thank you to God for what has
been done. We want to say thank you to the Minister. We say
congratulations! This is a good thing that he has done for our people. They
will now succeed in paying their funeral organisations. This will now put a
stop to a situation in which an older person dies and people find
themselves not having money to bury him or her. Thank you, Minister, we say
forward with the good work that you have done! What we are doing today will
change the lives of grannies at home. They will now be able to go to
hospital and care for their health and improve the quality of the food they
eat.
I would like to say something about the place in which they receive their
pensions. There is no shade, there are no places with roofs to shield them
during rainy and sunny times, because they are burnt when it is sunny.
There are no toilets or water. We would like these things to be provided
for them so that they can wait freely and happily for their money.

We will do this in the end. Let us try to improve these places as well as
the ways in which these people are transported to the places where they
receive their pensions. Sometimes one finds that wheelbarrows transport
those who are terribly sick. That can be improved by having someone to sign
for them and someone to care for them or to provide them with transport.
They should not stand in a long queue; instead they should get their money
quickly.

The Minister of Finance said: ``Tlala e kotsing. Ka sesotho sa Limpopo re
re mma o tlile, tlala o nyele.'' [``Hunger is in trouble. In Limpopo Sotho
people say mother has arrived, and now hunger has vanished.'']

Sithi akube kuhle ekhaya, abantu bakithi bajabule, baphumelele ukuthokoza
ebudaleni babo. Ayikho into ebuhlungu njengokuhlala kabuhlungu usumdala.
Ngelinye laba basebenzi abadlala ngabo nabo bazoba badala. Sithi phambili
ngombuso kaKhongolose, phambili! Phambili ngalokhu okuhle okwenziwa
uNgqongqoshe, phambili! [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[Things must be good at home; our people must be happy in their old age.
There is nothing more painful than living badly when you are old. One day
those workers that ill-treat older people will get old. We say forward with
the ANC Government, forward! Forward with the good thing the Minister has
done, forward!] [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, at last this House has a chairperson
with wing and a decent handicap. Congratulations! There is nothing to say
after Mma Ntuli has spoken.
There is really nothing to say, but let me just pick up a what the hon
Bhengu said earlier, because I think that it is pertinent. Part of what we
are dealing with here is the failure of democracy. It happens because we do
not observe in our constituencies the failings of public servants.
Therefore, if there is one plea arising out of this, it is that we correct
these issues when we realise them. Far better that we correct them in the
interests of people, and that we remain committed to Batho Pele, than that
we come here and make grand statements. It is not about statements or
resolutions or getting faces in the newspapers; it is about people in a
complex system like ours, in a complex democracy like ours, where decisions
about the administration of pensions are taken low down in the
administration, far from where we are. It is necessary that we correct
these issues when we are alive to them. It there is anything out of this
experience, my pleading would be that we correct that.

The second issue is that the court did not rule this. There was an out-of-
court settlement. In terms of the agreement between the Black Sash as
litigants and the Department of Social Development, these are the
agreements reached and then confirmed by the court.

The third point, to Dr Rabie, is that I am of the view that Mike Sampsons'
figures are suspect. But having said that, we must not in any way move away
from the fact that grinding poverty is a reality for many South Africans.
We must work to eliminate that. Let this be a beginning. Let us take these
issues to our people and ensure that the true beneficiaries benefit from
this. Let us root out freeloaders in society and let us ensure that we can
get resources to the poorest of the poor.

Siyabulela kakhulu! [Thank you very much!]
