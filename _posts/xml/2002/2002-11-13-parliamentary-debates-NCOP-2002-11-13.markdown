The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  It  is  interesting  that  when  you   are
multilingual everybody understands  you.  Nobody  had  any  difficulty  with
that!

                       PRECEDENCE TO ORDER OF THE DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That, after the second Order of the  Day,  precedence  be  given  to  the
  seventh Order of the Day.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

          FAILURE OF ZIMBABWE'S LEADERSHIP TO GOVERN THEIR COUNTRY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the failure of Zimbabwe's leadership to govern that country  and
           the great depression that has come over that land because of the
           hurtful policies placed upon that land by President Mugabe;


       (b)  that our policy of quiet diplomacy has not assisted in  any  way
           the people of Zimbabwe, despite the claim,  predictably  so,  by
           its Foreign  Minister,  Mr  Mudenge,  on  the  success  of  this
           approach;


       (c)  that Zimbabwe is depleted of all resources and now comes to  beg
           for assistance from this  country  for  the  despair  they  have
           brought upon themselves through their corrupt practices; and


       (d)  that we strongly disagree with the position  taken  by  Minister
           Zuma that we should put behind us the mistakes made by Zimbabwe;
           and


  (2) therefore -


       (a)  first and foremost, strongly  condemns  Zimbabwe's  undemocratic
           and destructive policies that brought them to this crisis;


       (b)  acknowledges the failure of our policy on  quiet  diplomacy,  as
           this approach did not provide the diplomatic impact  to  prevent
           the violent farm  evictions,  the  food  crisis  and  subsequent
           economic fall of Zimbabwe;
       (c)  deplores the statement by Minister  Zuma  that  Zimbabwe's  past
           must be forgotten,  as  if  treatment  of  its  people  and  the
           destruction of its land by the Zimbabwean authorities are  trite
           and insignificant events in the history of that country; and


       (d)  supports the role of  South  Africa  to  provide  assistance  to
           resolve our neighbour's crisis, but  that  stringent  conditions
           must apply and that early internationally  supervised  elections
           be held as an urgent priority.

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  Is  there  any  objection  to  that  motion?
[Interjections.] There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes  notice
of a motion.

               PAYMENT OF TRADITIONAL HEALERS BY MEDICAL AIDS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes a newspaper article saying that medical aids may have to accept
       traditional healers;


  (2) further notes that research has shown that more than  70%  of  blacks
       prefer  to  consult  inyanga  [traditional  healers]   and   izangoma
       [diviners], rather than Western-trained medical doctors;


  (3) is of the opinion that if the medical aids are prepared  to  pay  the
       bills of homeopaths, they should pay the bills of traditional African
       healers and practitioners; and


  (4) therefore appeals to the traditional healers to  organise  themselves
       in a formal structure that will regulate their industry.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to  that  motion?  There
is  an  objection.  The  motion  therefore  becomes  notice  of  a   motion.
[Interjections.]

I was aware of what you were doing. There is an objection.

            AMENDMENT TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION BILL
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That -


  (1) notwithstanding Rule 173(2) of  the  National  Council  of  Provinces
       Rules, an amendment amending clause 64(2) of the International  Trade
       Administration Bill [B 38D - 2002] be tabled for consideration by the
       Council today in terms of Rule 173(5)(b) of the Council Rules; and


  (2) the Council notes that a copy of the amendment has  been  distributed
       to all members in the Chamber.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      NONCEBA FAMILY COUNSELLING CENTRE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that -


       (a)  there are not enough places where children can seek help if they
           are victimised;


       (b)  at national level the SA Council for Child  and  Family  Welfare
           deals with more than 20 000 abused children annually;


       (c)  child abuse, neglect and exploitation is  a  national  emergency
           that deserves the undivided attention of the executive, all  our
           legislatures, non-governmental  organisations  and  the  private
           sector;


       (d)  in Khayelitsha, a community of more than half a million  people,
           where it is estimated that one  in  every  three  children  will
           suffer serious sexual abuse before the age of  18,  the  Nonceba
           Family Counselling Centre is the only facility to  which  abused
           and neglected children can turn for help; and


       (e)  this centre deals with an average of 30 cases a day;


  (2) thanks both the Kromboom Rotary Club and BP for their help in getting
       the said centre off the ground; and


  (3) endorses the call by the Premier of the Western Cape for  support  by
       the private sector for NGOs dealing with child abuse.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          DISASTER MANAGEMENT BILL

      (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Local
                   Government and Administration thereon)

The MINISTER FOR  PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson  and  hon
members, the Bill which is before the House today  signals,  both  in  needs
orientation and  effects,  a  paradigmatic  shift  from  an  approach  which
emphasised mitigation of  the  effects  of  disasters  to  one  which  gives
precedence to the prevention of disasters.  The  emphasis  of  the  Disaster
Management Bill  is  on  insulating  our  environment  and  population  from
disasters and their pernicious impacts.

If the disasters still occur despite  and  in  spite  of  our  precautionary
measures, then we have the responsibility to  ensure  that  the  impacts  of
those disasters are effectively mitigated.  The  Bill  visualises  that  all
three spheres of government, ie national, provincial and  local,  will  take
separate but  complementary  responsibilities  to  deal  with  the  problems
associated with disasters. For instance, provinces have  the  responsibility
to craft disaster management plans and strategies that  will  eventually  be
an integral part of the national disaster management strategy.

Disaster management,  being  a  multisectoral  and  multidisciplinary  task,
demands  maximum  integration  and  co-ordination  between  and  within  the
spheres of government. Our work in this functional area must  be  understood
within the context of the responsibility we have to ensure that  our  people
reside and work in areas that are livable and have conditions  that  promote
sustainable development.

We have recently witnessed instances  where  the  impressive  work  that  is
being done in the development nodes, especially the  rural  ones,  has  been
threatened by erosion arising from all  manner  of  disasters.  Since  these
areas were designated as nodes because they are pervasive with  poverty,  it
is clear that the poor are most vulnerable to disasters.  The  frontiers  of
prosperity  are  not  likely  to  expand  enough  to  encompass   previously
marginalised areas, unless we bring disaster management  to  the  centre  of
our development work.

In keeping with Government's delivery policy orientation,  the  Bill  exorts
civil society  in  all  its  dimensions  to  play  an  active  role  in  the
prevention of disasters, as well as  in  disaster  mitigation.  This  is  an
important element of  preparedness.  It  harnesses  the  energies  of  local
people, both by way of civic education and the organisation of  communities,
to cope with disaster. Civic education to teach people about the dangers  of
threats such as veld fires and the risk of  lighting  fires  in  dry,  bushy
areas are critical to a preventative strategy.
If people are more informed and are aware of the dangers  facing  them,  the
risk of these dangers is lessened. Similarly,  the  more  prepared  a  local
community is to deal with a disaster, the better  the  community  will  cope
with  the  disaster  when  it  finally  strikes.  The  Bill  makes  specific
reference to the need for disaster management  volunteers.  It  is  critical
that local organisational structures such  as  ward  committees  and  civics
take up the challenge to meet the need for disaster management.

From all points of view, this is a good Bill. I commend  it  to  the  House.
[Applause.]

Mr B J MKALIPHI: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister  and  members,  during  the
historic visit of this Council to the Eastern Cape province at  the  end  of
July this year, some of the members of this institution were for  the  first
time witnesses to the ravages  of  a  natural  disaster.  Some  of  us  were
astounded by the sheer magnitude of the devastation in that province.

What this disaster demonstrated to us was the  reality  that  disasters  are
particularly severe on poor and vulnerable communities.  And  as  the  Chief
Whip of this House, the hon Enver Surty, pointed out during the  President's
debate yesterday,  this  Council  was  able  -  in  an  unprecedented  move,
together with local government representatives and traditional leaders -  to
visit disaster-affected areas, sympathise with the victims  and  render  the
necessary support, where possible.

The Disaster Management Bill before this House  today  is  informed  by  the
White Paper on Disaster Management which was published in  1997.  It  brings
about  a  uniform  and  integrated  approach   to   co-ordinating   disaster
management in all spheres of government,  and  to  promote  and  assist  the
implementation of disaster management measures in all  sectors  of  society.
In order to achieve this, the Bill  focuses  on  disaster  management  as  a
continuous,  integrated,  multisectoral  and  multidisciplinary  process  of
planning and implementation.

Further, the Bill provides for the  establishment  of  a  national  advisory
forum. The forum will be chaired by the the head of  the  National  Disaster
Management  Centre,  which  is  to  be  given  certain  special   functions,
including,  among  others,   the   identification   and   establishment   of
communication links with disaster management  role-players  in  the  private
and public sectors,  as  well  as  the  development  and  maintenance  of  a
directory of contact persons and institutional role-players.

The select committee trusts that this disaster  management  centre  and  its
management  and   support   structures   will   be   strengthened   by   the
implementation of  this  Bill.  We  believe  that  this  Bill  and  disaster
management in practice is an integral part of our legislation  and  policies
that are aimed at alleviating  the  plight  of  the  poorest  of  the  poor.
Because our people were historically resigned  to  the  peripheries  of  the
most vulnerable corners of the South African landscape, this Bill is  indeed
timeous if one considers that the year 2002  was  the  year  of  sustainable
development.

Given  the  severe  impact  that  disasters  have  on   these   marginalised
households - as the disaster in  the  Eastern  Cape  and  similar  disasters
elsewhere in our  country  profoundly  demonstrated  -  the  need  for  this
legislation has, in fact, become acute. It is geared towards  improving  the
state of preparedness and risk reduction, not only relief and recovery.

Moreover, the recent Johannesburg World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development
has exposed the extent to which developing countries like ours  are  lagging
behind with regard to the  lack  of  the  elementary  knowledge  that  other
communities elsewhere have about disasters.

It has made the following observations in this regard: loss of  biodiversity
continues; fish stocks continue to be depleted; and deserts claim  more  and
more fertile land. The adverse  effects  of  climatic  changes  are  already
evident. Natural disasters are  more  frequent  and  more  devastating,  and
developing countries more vulnerable.

In conclusion, it is incumbent on us as a legislature  to  join  hands  with
all sectors of our communities and ensure that they are  educated,  informed
and actively prepared for the disasters in the sky, in the seas and  in  the
veld. [Applause]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, hon Minister, the DA is of  the  opinion  that  the
Disaster Management Bill, together with the establishment of an  appropriate
risk management strategy for the agricultural sector, will  contribute  much
to ensure that the  inevitability  of  disaster  is  reduced  to  manageable
proportions.

Three phases in the approach to disaster management are highlighted  in  the
Bill: before, during and after. It is difficult to say  which  is  the  most
important: whether it will be the work of the National  Disaster  Management
Centre in predicting or preventing disaster; the  management  capability  of
provincial and local government to act expeditiously during a  disaster;  or
the role of the Treasury after the event, which  must  assist  in  restoring
conditions which prevailed before the disaster.

What is not necessarily  highlighted  by  the  Bill  but  is  borne  out  in
practice is the need for  swift  and  meaningful  assistance.  I  will  give
members an example of the way in which real events occurred, as they did  in
the Highveld of the Eastern Free State, in Mpumalanga and  in  KwaZulu-Natal
in September 2001.

An unusual conjuncture of circumstances characterised  by  devastating  veld
fires followed by extremely cold conditions during September  2001  resulted
in enormous damages in terms  of  livestock  losses,  as  well  as  loss  of
grazing  land,  infrastructure,  plantations  and  crops  for  thousands  of
farmers in the above-mentioned provinces.

Strong winds fanned runaway veld fires,  turning  them  into  infernos  that
left a path of destruction among human beings, human habitation,  machinery,
livestock, plantations and food crops. High day temperatures contributed  to
a situation in which cattle  shed  their  winter  coats,  making  them  more
vulnerable to  extremely  cold  temperatures  which,  at  that  stage,  were
neither foreseen nor predicted.

The warm, dry conditions were immediately followed by an unprecedented  wave
of bitterly cold conditions on 12 September  2001.  This  caused  many  farm
animals that had survived the veld  fires  to  die.  Emerging  and  communal
farmers, in particular, were affected extremely negatively in that  many  of
these farmers lost most of their herds  and  in  many  cases  all  of  their
livestock. This catastrophic climatic phenomenon is  the  first  experienced
within living memory in those areas.

No insurance is available for animals  that  die  in  cold  and/or  freezing
conditions, while insurance against other natural risks - excluding  animals
in transit - is unaffordable, since premiums amount to approximately 16%  of
the value of the insured product. The number of claims totalled 16  000  and
the direct losses totalled between R18 million and  R248  million.  However,
losses are also loss of income and production capacity.

As far as my understanding of this particular situation goes,  the  Minister
for Agriculture and Land Affairs has promised assistance  to  the  value  of
50% of the animal losses, but more than a year later  the  disaster  remains
with the victims and compensation has not been forthcoming. In the  meantime
stock prices have virtually doubled - gains in  which  these  farmers  could
not participate, but will double their costs when they replace the  animals.
This uncertainty and delay is unacceptable.

The  suffering  caused  by  the  event  itself   reinforces   the   critical
requirement that action following disasters be  undertaken  with  tremendous
dedication and speed, so that such suffering is not  prolonged.  This  will,
indeed, be the final test for the success of this Bill, which has  our  full
support. [Applause.]

Mr J J DOWRY (Western Cape): Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  members,  today
is the first time that I will address the NCOP and it is, indeed, an  honour
and a privilege to participate in this debate in this distinguished House.

With the Disaster Management Bill South Africa will  have  a  framework  for
national  disaster  management.  This  will  most  definitely   provide   an
integrated and uniform approach to disaster management,  not  only  for  the
national,  provincial  and  local  spheres  of  government,  but  also   for
statutory functionaries, NGOs, the private sector and communities.

For the first time we have legislation which will  merge  fragmented  pieces
of legislation into one comprehensive disaster management  policy.  This  is
focused on the consolidation of disaster management in South  Africa,  where
the burden of responsibility is on all three spheres of government.

This Disaster Management Bill is also a unique piece of  legislation  as  it
is based on international standards. Its foundation  is  the  UN's  disaster
management  continuum  consisting  of   risk   reduction   principles   like
prevention, mitigation and preparedness,  as  well  as  recovery  principles
like response, relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction.

The Disaster Management Bill will take us from  the  predominantly  reactive
civil  protection  approach  to  a  dynamic  proactive  disaster  management
approach.  All  role-players  in  the  drafting  of  this   Bill   must   be
congratulated, specifically Louis Buys and his team  in  the  Department  of
Provincial and Local Government, on paving the way since 1997 to make  South
Africa a leading country in terms of disaster management.

The Western Cape supports this Bill, as  it  is  guiding  legislation  which
will assist this province in dealing with disaster management.

Die Wet op Munisipale  Stelsels  is  baie  duidelik  in  die  voorskrif  dat
wanneer funksies en bevoegdhede na munisipaliteite oorgedra word, daar  eers
sekere voorgeskrewe stappe moet wees. Eers nadat  die  proses  deurloop  is,
kan die aangeleenthede by wyse van wetgewing  aan  munisipaliteite  oorgedra
word. Daarom is dit van kardinale belang om nie net die  verantwoordelikheid
met baie besliste verpligtinge aan munisipaliteite oor te dra nie, maar  ook
die  nodige  finansiële  ondersteuning.  In  die  geval  van  die   betrokke
wetgewing is dit die nasionale  Regering  wat  funksies  oordra  en  is  dit
daarom noodsaaklik dat die nasionale  Regering  ook  sy  verantwoordelikheid
moet nakom deur nie net die finansiële ondersteuning te voorsien  nie,  maar
ook  die  kapasiteitsbou-inisiatiewe  te  help   vestig.   (Translation   of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The Municipal Structures Act is very clear in  its  instruction  that  when
functions and powers are transferred to municipalities,  certain  prescribed
steps should first be followed. Only once the  process  has  been  followed,
can matters be transferred to municipalities by means of  legislation.  That
is why it is of cardinal importance not only to transfer the  responsibility
to municipalities  with  very  firm  obligations,  but  also  the  necessary
financial support. In the case of the legislation in  question,  it  is  the
national Government that transfers functions and it is  therefore  essential
that the national Government also  meets  its  responsibility  by  not  only
providing financial support, but also assists  with  establishing  capacity-
building initiatives.]

In the Western Cape we have had recent examples of natural  disasters  which
were tragic by their very nature. The wide-spread flooding and storm  damage
during the  past  winter  months  brought  untold  misery  and  hardship  to
thousands of people. In the past we have had  earthquakes,  oil  spills  and
forest fires, and with every disaster we gained more experience to  help  us
cope with the next one.

Ten einde  die  moniterings-,  koördinerings-  en  ondersteuningsfunksie  in
rampbestuur na te kom, het die provinsiale regering  van  die  Wes-Kaap  die
volgende programme ontwikkel en ook gefinansier: Die daarstel  van  'n  GIS-
gebaseerde  rekenaarprogram  vir  rampbestuur  wat  deur   alle   munisipale
owerhede,  provinsiale  departemente  en  veiligheidsmagte   in   die   Wes-
Kaapprovinsie gebruik  gaan  word.  Tans  word  ondersoek  ingestel  na  die
daarstel van 'n  rampbestuursrisiko-  en  kwesbaarheidsmodel  vir  die  Wes-
Kaapprovinsie.  Die  model  sal  alle  moontlike   rampgevare   wetenskaplik
ontleed. Die projek word  tans  in  samewerking  met  die  Universiteit  van
Kaapstad en die Universiteit van  die  Vrystaat  ten  uitvoer  gebring.  Die
finansiering van 'n helikopter vir ondersteuning in brandbestryding  in  die
Kaapstad    metropolitaanse    gebied,    én    die     finansiering     van
brandbestrydingstoerusting      by      informele      nedersettings      en
brandbestrydingsvoertuie ter ondersteuning van nooddienste op  die  N1  word
verskaf. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In order to comply with the monitoring, co-ordinating and support  function
in disaster management, the provincial government of the  Western  Cape  has
developed and also financed the following programmes: The introduction of  a
GIS-based computer programme for disaster management that will  be  used  by
all municipal authorities, provincial departments  and  security  forces  in
the Western Cape province. At present investigation is being made  into  the
introduction of a disaster management risk and vulnerability model  for  the
Western Cape. The model will scientifically analyse all possible  disasters.
The  project  is  at  present  being  undertaken  in  association  with  the
University of Cape Town and the University of the Free State.  Financing  of
a helicopter for support in fire-fighting in the Cape metropolitan area,  as
well as fire-fighting equipment at informal  settlements  and  fire-fighting
vehicles to support emergency services on the N1 is being provided.]

Disaster management is not a competency  of  Government  alone,  be  it  the
national, provincial or local government. The partnership  with  communities
is the critical element  in  the  success  or  failure  of  each  and  every
disaster management plan. That is why I am  pleased  with  the  emphasis  on
disaster management volunteers in the Disaster Management Bill.

A delegation from the Western Cape visited Germany  in  October  last  year.
The delegation came back from Germany and expressed its admiration  for  the
role and input of volunteers from local  communities  in  fire-fighting  and
disaster management. In the state  of  Bavaria  in  Germany  volunteers  are
solely responsible for fire-fighting in municipalities with a population  of
less than 100 000. They  are,  however,  provided  with  all  the  necessary
equipment and training.

There is a critical need for volunteers in the Western Cape,  especially  in
our disadvantaged  communities,  where  people  are  often  the  victims  of
devastating fires and flooding. It is  said  that  international  experience
has shown that more or less  8%  of  any  given  community  is  involved  in
voluntary work in their community. The legislation we are debating today  is
a  start  in  the  process  to  involve  volunteers.  I  want  to  use  this
opportunity today to urge our communities in  the  Western  Cape  to  become
involved in fire-fighting and other  emergency  spheres  such  as  emergency
rescue, disaster and resource management.

Ek  sal  my   plig   versaak   as   ek   nie   ten   minste   die   verskeie
noodlenigingsorganisasies bedank vir die voortreflike rol  wat  hulle  reeds
in die Wes-Kaap gespeel het, en nog sal speel nie. Daarom wil ek  graag  die
geleentheid gebruik  om  hulde  te  bring  aan  die  Rooikruis,  St  John's-
ambulansdiens,  die  Nasionale  Seereddingsinstituut,   die   Life   Savers-
organisasie, die Noodhulpliga, SANZAF en  ander  geloofsorganisasies,  asook
Meals on Wheels. Hierdie is almal organisasies wat uit vrywilligers  bestaan
en wat reeds die lot van duisende mense verlig  het.  Vandag  wil  ek  hulle
bedank vir hul toewyding en hul verbintenis  tot  naastediens.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I would be failing my duty  if  I  did  not  at  least  thank  the  various
disaster relief organisations  for  the  outstanding  role  that  they  have
played and will play in the Western Cape. For that reason  I  want  to  take
the opportunity to pay  tribute  to  the  Red  Cross,  St  John's  Ambulance
Service, the National Sea Rescue Institute, the  Life  Savers  organisation,
the First Aid League, SANZAF and other religious organisations, as  well  as
Meals on Wheels. All of these organisations consist of volunteers  and  they
have already brought relief to the plight of thousands of people. I want  to
thank them today for their dedication and commitment to charity.]

Let me conclude by saying that we can have  the  best  legislation  and  the
best intentions in the world, but words on paper mean nothing  unless  there
is the  capacity  to  deliver  and  the  will  to  properly  implement  this
legislation.

The Western Cape  has  accepted  the  challenges  with  regard  to  disaster
management and, together with our municipalities  and  our  communities,  we
will confront the barriers of ignorance and negativity. I am confident  that
we have the necessary expertise and knowledge in this province to  implement
this legislation and manage any disaster confronting us. [Applause.]

Mr J HORNE: Agb Voorsitter, agb Minister en  lede  van  die  Huis,  alhoewel
daar  ver  gevorder  is  met  navorsing  om  rampe  te   voorspel   en   kan
voorsorgmaatreëls tydig daarteen geneem word, is daar rampe,  veral  van  'n
natuurlike aard, wat  skielik  sonder  enige  waarskuwing  en  met  ernstige
gevolge plaasvind, en wat soms baie lewens eis.

Ons huidige wetgewing wat rampe betref, is meer  toegespits  op  wat  gedoen
kan word ná ernstige rampe, terwyl die wetsontwerp onder  bespreking  vandag
onder meer die  belangrikheid  van  voorkoming  en  verligting  en  'n  nuwe
benadering tot  rampbestuur  bepleit.  Belangrike  rolspelers  hier  is  die
regering, privaatsektor, gemeenskappe en nieregeringsorganisasies.

Alhoewel rampe die kwesbaarheid van alle mense  raak,  het  die  geskiedenis
ons geleer dat dit veral die arm en  agtergeblewe  gemeenskappe  die  meeste
raak. Die instelling van 'n effektiewe rampbestuurstrategie is van  uiterste
belang. Koördinering, samewerking,  opleiding  en  gemeenskapsbewustheid  is
van kardinale belang.

Alhoewel  rampe  geklassifiseer  kan  word  as  nasionaal,  provinsiaal   of
plaaslik om primêre verantwoordelikheid daarvoor aan te dui,  moet  al  drie
vlakke van regering betrokke raak in hierdie verband. Daar is  egter  kommer
oor hoe arm munisipaliteite rampbestuursentrums gaan  finansier,  aldus  sal
daar duidelike riglyne aan munisipaliteite gegee moet word hoe  om  geld  te
bekom, want dit mag  en  kan  'n  wesenlike  probleem  word.  Die  nasionale
rampbestuursentrum moet so gou as moontlik ingestel word  om  paraatheid  te
verseker.

Ten slotte, openbare verhore is gehou rondom hierdie wet en die  kommer  wat
daar uitgespreek is, is sover as moontlik geakkommodeer in die wet.

Aldus,  die  Nuwe  NP  steun  die  wet.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  members  of  the  House,
although much progress has been made with research to predict disasters  and
precautionary measures against  them  can  be  taken  timeously,  there  are
disasters, especially of a natural nature,  which  occur  suddenly,  without
any warning, with  serious  consequences  and  which  sometimes  claim  many
lives.

Our present legislation relating to disasters is aimed at what can  be  done
after serious disasters, whereas the Bill under  discussion  today  focuses,
inter alia, on the importance of prevention and relief,  and  makes  a  plea
for a new approach to disaster management. In this  regard  important  role-
players are  the  Government,  the  private  sector,  communities  and  non-
governmental organisations.

Although disasters affect the  vulnerability  of  all  people,  history  has
taught us that they most affect the poor and  disadvantaged  communities  in
particular. The introduction of an effective  disaster  management  strategy
is of the  utmost  importance.  Co-ordination,  co-operation,  training  and
community awareness are vitally important.

Although disasters can be classified as national,  provincial  or  local  to
indicate primary responsibility for them,  all  three  tiers  of  government
should become involved in this regard. However, there is concern  about  how
poor municipalities are going to finance disaster  management  centres,  and
therefore municipalities will have to be given clear guidelines  on  how  to
acquire money, because this might and could  become  an  essential  problem.
The national disaster management centre  must  be  established  as  soon  as
possible to ensure preparedness.

In conclusion, public hearings were held on this law, and the  concern  that
was expressed there has been accommodated  in  the  legislation  as  far  as
possible.

The New NP therefore supports the Bill.]

Mr O P DIKGETSI: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, members of the House,  the
White Paper on Disaster Management identified the  need  to  develop  a  new
approach in dealing with disaster management in the country.

It is on this premise that the  Disaster  Management  Bill  provides,  inter
alia, for an integrated and co-ordinated  disaster  management  policy  that
focuses on preventing or reducing the  risk  of  disasters,  mitigating  the
severity of disasters, emergency preparedness, rapid and effective  response
to disasters and post-disaster recovery.

To this end the province has already embarked on a process of reviewing  the
integrated development plans  of  all  municipalities  in  the  province  to
ensure that disaster management forms an integral part  of  the  development
planning at local government level.

In preparing the readiness of role-players,  the  province,  in  conjunction
with the Department of Provincial and Local Government, has already  trained
29 councillors, 25 functionaries and 22 volunteers.  However,  there  is  an
acute need to roll out training for other role-players.

In terms of the Bill, the Minister will be  able  to  publish  the  national
disaster management framework that will provide  an  appropriate,  coherent,
transparent and inclusive policy on disaster management  for  the  whole  of
the Republic. The framework will also give effect to the application of  co-
operative governance on  issues  of  disaster  management  among  the  three
spheres of government. This will  also  encourage  us  in  the  province  to
ensure that the only two category B  municipalities  and  all  the  district
municipalities  in  the  province  that  have  the  capacity  to  deal  with
disasters are in a position to share their resources and knowledge with  the
other needy municipalities.

Most significantly, the framework will facilitate  the  involvement  of  the
private  sector,  non-governmental  organisations,  technical  experts   and
volunteers in disaster management, something that does not exist now.
The framework will also provide a framework within  which  organs  of  state
may fund  disaster  management  with  specific  emphasis  on  preventing  or
reducing the risk of disasters, including  grants  to  contribute  to  post-
disaster recovery and rehabilitation.

Due to the nature of municipalities in the province, namely that  there  are
small municipalities and vast distances between those municipalities in  the
province, it is necessary to consider making a once-off allocation or  grant
to those needy municipalities to enable them to deal  with  basic  disasters
that may occur in their jurisdictions.

Members will agree with me when I say that the promulgation of this Bill  is
long   overdue.   Its   promulgation   will,   inter   alia,   ensure   that
municipalities, organs of state, the  private  sector  and  non-governmental
organisations  in  the  province  prepare  disaster  management  plans   and
strategies on  prevention,  mitigation  and  response  initiatives  for  the
disasters that the province is prone to, namely droughts, fires and  floods.
The effect of this will necessitate  additional  funding  and  personnel  in
both provincial and local government spheres.

The Bill will also ensure that provincial and municipal disaster  management
centres execute their significant role of monitoring, measuring  performance
and evaluating disaster management plans, as well as prevention,  mitigation
and response initiatives on disasters.

The provincial and  municipal  disaster  management  centres  will  annually
compile  a  report  which  will  be  submitted  to  the  Minister  and   the
legislature. The report will, inter alia, entail the results  of  monitoring
of prevention and mitigation initiatives, disasters  that  occurred  in  the
province, their magnitude and severity, as well as the effects they had  and
recommendations on how to deal with problems encountered.

Currently none of the  31  municipalities  in  the  province  have  budgeted
sufficiently for  disaster  management.  As  a  result,  there  are  serious
problems when  communities  should  be  assisted  with  funds  for  disaster
prevention, mitigation, recovery and  rehabilitation.  The  promulgation  of
the  Bill  will  ensure  that  provincial  and  municipal  organs  of  state
contribute financially  to  preparedness,  response  efforts,  post-disaster
recovery and rehabilitation.

The  successful  implementation  of  the  Bill  is   also   dependent   upon
municipalities obtaining the co-operation and assistance  of  dedicated  and
willing  South  Africans   who   will   serve   as   volunteers   in   those
municipalities. The recruitment of these citizens puts an obligation on  the
province and municipalities to train them on how  to  deal  effectively  and
efficiently with disasters.

Let us make it our duty to encourage our friends, families,  neighbours  and
comrades to join the units  of  volunteers  that  will  be  established.  We
concur with the hon Minister that this is a good Bill.

Nksz P C P MAJODINA: Sihlalo obekekileyo, mandilibulele  ithuba,  Mphathiswa
namalungu   eBhunga   lamaPhondo.   Intatho-nxaxheba    kwingxoxo-mpikiswano
kuMthetho  oYilwayo  ojongene  neentlokele  eMzantsi  Afrika.   Lo   Mthetho
ubandakanya  wonke  ummi  woMzantsi  Afrika.  Lo  nguMthetho  oza  kuncedana
nokukhuthaza abantu ukuba bazikhusele  iintlekele  zingekehli.  Ukwakhuthaza
ukusetyenziswa  kolwazi  lwemveli   ekulweni   neentlekele.   Thina   sizazi

Ndiyabulela. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

USIHLALO WEBHUNGA LESIZWE  LAMAPHONDO:  Bathi  isiXhosa  sinzima.  Ndiyabona
ukuba lo mntu utolikayo  ebebambekile  kakhulu  namhlanje.  (Translation  of
Xhosa speech follows.)

[Ms P C P MAJODINA: Hon Chairperson, let me thank you for the opportunity  I
am given. Minister and members of the NCOP, with regard to participation  in
the debate on the Disaster Management Bill, this is  a  Bill  that  includes
everybody. This is a Bill that will assist in  encouraging  people  to  help
themselves  before  disaster  strikes.  It  also  encourages  the   use   of
indigenous knowledge to combat disaster.

We really know disaster. We are not just talking boldly about  something  we
don't know. We are victims  of  floods,  of  snow,  of  veld  fires  and  of
tornadoes.  This  Bill  also  strengthens  the   law   against   those   who
deliberately undermine it. It places a  responsibility  on  all  spheres  of
government to set up councils that will deal with disaster when it  strikes.
It also encourages the citizens of South  Africa  to  commit  themselves  to
patriotism and to be volunteers at a time when they are supposed  to  be  in
mourning. Moreover, those persons will be easily identifiable by the  attire
they will put on so that we don't find our  people  being  helped  by  bogus
helpers.

Minister, when a particular area has been  declared  a  disaster  area,  let
there be some movement and something that accompanies it, because  when  you
appear and say that you have declared an area a disaster  area,  the  people
expect to be moved  from  the  trying  times  and  put  in  eternal  heaven.
However, you arrive at such  a  place  and  depart  with  dust  having  been
stirred up, never to be seen  again.  It  should  be  noted  that  when  you
arrive, it does raise the hopes of the people.

The other area is the fact that  even  with  us,  people  smeared  with  red
ochre, the primitive, can be helped by this Bill and can be provided for  in
this single rondavel that I own. It is not only intended to cater for  large
households, but it says disaster is disaster, no matter who  experiences  it
or where it occurs. We are grateful for this Bill.

Minister and Chairperson of the NCOP, disaster is an  uprising  against  the
Government, because whilst we are focused on  improving  the  lives  of  our
people, it would set us back. The ANC  supports  this  Bill.  Municipalities
are given authority to move people away from places that might be  hazardous
to them. Municipalities must also use amended regulations to  remove  people
who are destroying the land and placing their lives at risk.

Minister, this is a baby, a tender infant. Give it  some  ``isicakathi''  [a
preparation made from various medical roots] so that the baby  can  walk  on
its own. Thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: They say isiXhosa is difficult. I  notice  that
the person who is interpreting was under great pressure today.]

Mr K PANDAY (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Chair,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,
allow me at the  very  outset  to  state  that  kwaZulu-Natal  supports  the
Disaster Management Bill.

The Disaster Management Bill  is  a  very  important  piece  of  legislation
because, for the first time in the history  of  our  country,  there  is  an
attempt to look at the remedies for the  situation  in  a  holistic  manner.
This in itself is a commendable endeavour. To  my  mind  the  basis  of  any
serious disaster strategy is the effort to prevent  and  mitigate  disasters
instead of simply managing them. The Bill  goes  far  enough  in  addressing
such an initiative.

Disasters  take  different  forms.  They  are   natural   or   human-created
situations that cause or threaten to cause death,  injury,  disease,  damage
to the  environment  and  the  destruction  of  the  life  of  a  community.
Throughout the years we had disasters caused by  tornadoes  in  the  Eastern
Cape and elsewhere; floods on the Cape Flats and  the  Cato  Manor  squatter
camp; veld fires throughout the country; fires in  informal  settlements  in
Gauteng; and tens of deaths at the Ellis  Park  soccer  derby.  Indeed,  the
list is almost endless.

Disasters are destructive. They demoralise  people  psychologically,  weaken
them  emotionally   and   create   serious   health,   poverty,   financial,
environmental and other social problems. There are innovations  in  the  Act
to counteract many of these problems, but there are  also  several  critical
questions that need to  be  asked  and  commented  upon  in  a  constructive
manner, to help everyone relook and revisit the Bill in its entirety.

Intergovernmental structures and frameworks are thorough and  comprehensive.
However,  the  very  wide  and  consultative  composition  of  the  National
Management Advisory Forum might turn it into an inflexible and  bureaucratic
state organ incapable of making the necessary decisions  and  interventions.
Although  co-ordination  and  consultation  are  of   importance   in   such
circumstances, in most cases disasters demand urgent  measures  and  actions
that only a flexible decision-making body can undertake.  The  action  taken
must be swift and instantaneous.

The establishment of a National Disaster Management  Centre  is  a  priority
that needs to  become  a  reality  very  soon,  as  its  work  can  lead  to
prevention and  mitigation.  The  same  is  true  of  provincial  management
centres that would be in constant consultation  and  co-operation  with  the
national centre.

The fact that the Bill requires all levels  and  spheres  of  government  to
draw up their own disaster  management  documents  is  important,  as  those
responsible will be able to utilise  their  historical  knowledge  of  their
areas in the completion of their  task.  The  process  of  co-operation  and
consultation between the various levels and spheres is  exemplified  in  the
Bill and is of primary importance. However, we propose that there be  yearly
evaluations at all spheres and levels of government.

Chapter 6  needs  revisiting,  especially  when  one  examines  closely  the
punitive measures regarding the prevention or  mitigation  of  disasters  in
relation  to  provinces.  It  is  always  important  to  have  a   reserved,
centralised  disaster  fund,  so  that  the  financial  exhaustion  that  is
mentioned in the document becomes measurable.  Clause  57(e)  provides  that
the national Government will refuse to help a  devastated  area  because  of
the exhaustion of funds or a possible inadequate prevention on the  part  of
the local government structures. These are key questions  that  need  to  be
answered.

Chapter 7 deals with a  very  crucial  matter  in  disaster  management,  ie
volunteers. It is accepted that volunteers need to be well trained  in  most
aspects of disaster management by the municipality.  However,  the  language
used in the document  at  present  needs  to  be  changed,  as  it  strongly
resembles military command structures. Disaster management  volunteers  need
to be well-trained and disciplined, but they  should  not  follow  military-
style patterns of command and organisational structures. The Bill  fills  an
immeasurable gap in our country's legislative framework.

In conclusion, we from KwaZulu-Natal wish all  our  Muslim  colleagues  well
over the period of fasting. May Allah - peace be upon Him  -  be  with  them
and their families. [Applause.]

Ms W TUSI  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members  and
special delegates, I wish to thank the  Chairperson  for  affording  me  the
opportunity to debate on this important Bill. I must first  applaud  members
of the NCOP for the sterling work they have done in  bringing  the  Bill  to
finality.

The country has  experienced  different  types  of  disasters  in  different
areas. They were either natural or man-made disasters. We have  had  floods,
snow,  veld  fires  and  fires  that  have  destroyed  homes   in   informal
settlements. During these unfortunate events  lives  were  lost  and  people
lost their  property  in  the  form  of  houses,  furniture,  livestock  and
agricultural products in the case of farmers. This  has  adversely  affected
our communities. It is therefore not a question of choice that  we  have  to
have this Bill.

We as a Government have an obligation to prevent  and  protect  our  country
and its citizens against these types of calamities. The Disaster  Management
Bill will enable us to respond appropriately to  disasters.  It  provides  a
legislative  framework  that  will  enable  the  Government  to  fulfil  its
obligation of looking after the country.

The Bill comes out very clearly on co-operative  governance,  as  stated  in
Chapter 3 of the Constitution. It also provides a legislative  framework  to
assist Government to respond whenever there are disasters that occur or  may
occur in Southern  Africa.  It  also  enables  us  to  have  information  on
international expertise and assistance in respect of disaster management.

We from KwaZulu-Natal support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, I do not normally talk for a  long  time,  but
because this Bill is very long, we will have to add another five minutes  to
my time. [Laughter.]

I must say that, as the ANC, we are very happy with clause  7  of  the  Bill
which deals with rapid response when a national disaster has been  declared.
We are very happy. We know exactly when  the  department  should  intervene,
and when we should intervene. That clause is very clear to everybody.

We are also very happy with clause 2(k), which indicates to  everybody  what
is going to happen in terms of funding.  That  clause  says,  among  others,
that when we develop our framework, we should look  into  ways  of  ensuring
that all spheres of government contribute. We should  also  make  sure  that
there is funding for this purpose. We are happy with that clause. Nobody  is
supposed to be complaining about funded or unfunded mandates.

We must thank Dr Louis Buys who is in the national centre.  Clearly,  whilst
we are debating this Bill today, the department is not  just  sitting  down,
waiting for us to pass this piece of legislation, after which it would  then
start preparing. They already have  mechanisms  in  place,  and  I  am  very
impressed and happy with that particular arrangement.

I must say that, in our briefings as the committee,  Dr  Buys  did  sterling
work. We hope that those were not just words, and that we  will  see  things
happening in practice. My colleague, Penny Majodina, said that we  come  out
in full force only when there is a disaster. I hope  that  is  not  what  is
going  to  happen,  because  we  are  now  talking  about   prevention   and
mitigation. We are moving away from reaction.

It is against this background that the ANC is in full support of this  Bill.
All the parties in our committee also  indicated  that  they  were  in  full
support. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson, let me  first
thank all the hon members who took part in the discussion of  this  Bill.  A
special word  of  thanks  goes  to  members  of  the  select  committee  for
processing the Bill, as well as for giving their full support  to  both  the
Ministry and the department. I  also  want  to  once  again  thank  all  the
members of the NCOP for the continuing concern they have  shown  about  this
problem of disasters.

The chairperson of the select committee, the hon  Mkaliphi,  emphasised  the
need for the necessary capacity to be put in  place  to  operationalise  the
provisions of this Bill once it becomes an Act  of  Parliament.  I  want  to
assure him that everything necessary  is  being  done  to  ensure  that  the
requisite capacity is in place. Right now  capacity-building  processes  are
underway in five provinces. Very soon we want to  make  sure  that  all  the
provinces are given  the  necessary  attention  with  respect  to  capacity-
building.

It was also emphasised that the law alone is not  going  to  solve  all  the
problems that we have. The Bill creates enabling conditions and a  framework
for dealing with the problem. Indeed, the fact that the law is in  place  is
very important.

I must say, lastly,  that  we  are  overwhelmed  by  the  support  which  we
received from this Council. We hope that we will continue to hold  hands  to
make sure that this problem is dealt with effectively.

The hon Maloyi said that we need to make sure  that  there  is  no  unfunded
mandate. However, he also noted that, although the Bill does  not  say  this
explicitly, it says that apart from making sure that there  is  no  unfunded
mandate, there should be no unmandated funding. [Laughter.] I cannot  assure
the House that that will not happen. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Bill  accordingly  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section   65   of   the
Constitution.

                   INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Economic and
                          Foreign Affairs thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND  INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  hon  members  and
delegates,  the  International  Trade  Administration  Bill  has   undergone
extensive consultation and debate, both inside and  outside  of  Parliament,
and we are pleased that the crucial moment of voting the Bill  into  law  in
this House has now arrived. As we get ready to  pass  this  Bill,  it  bears
reminding ourselves of the significant changes that  this  law  proposes  to
introduce, and of the motivation for them.

In an important sense, this Bill  is  an  affirmation  of  the  current  and
expected contribution of international trade to South Africa's  economy,  as
well as to the economies of our regional  neighbours,  particularly  in  the
Southern African Customs Union. Consequently, therefore,  the  establishment
of an effective system of international trade administration  is  imperative
to enable trade to contribute to economic growth and  development,  as  well
as rising incomes, investment and employment.

Government's policy of openness  to  trade  with  the  world  requires  that
economic operators, whether they be importers  or  exporters,  are  afforded
certainty,  efficiency  and  redress  to  enable  them  to   conduct   their
businesses and to sustain and grow their businesses. In establishing such  a
system through this Bill, we are placing trade policy in  the  driving  seat
of trade administration, ie allowing the lowering and  raising  of  tariffs,
the adjudication of unfair trade, etc, to be informed by national  interests
and policy objectives, and not by special interests and ad hoc lobbying,  as
used to happen in the past.

Moreover, our country's membership to agreements under the WTO,  SADC,  Sacu
and the EU means that practically all  of  South  Africa's  trade  with  the
world is governed by binding international trade laws  and  disciplines.  In
this sense, therefore, the clarity and certainty that  this  Bill  seeks  to
introduce to our trade administration is also an  obligation  to  our  trade
partners.

In essence, therefore, the International Trade Administration Bill is  about
adherence to good governance  that  we  so  much  seek  to  promote  -  good
governance in the domestic economy and as a member of  global  and  regional
trade systems.  Looking  at  the  Bill  itself,  the  requirement  that  the
Minister consults  stakeholders  in  issuing  trade  policy  statements  and
directives - as foreseen in our Constitution and in  laws  like  the  Nedlac
Act - is, indeed, good governance.

We welcome this emphasis in the Bill, which came from the  deliberations  of
the two committees of Parliament and the select committee of  the  NCOP,  as
well  as  from  inputs  and  submissions  that  were   received   from   the
stakeholders.  The  requirement  that  the  Minister  should  publish   such
statements and directives in the Gazette, as well as  the  policy  mandates,
procedures and decisions that are taken at the Sacu  level,  are  also  good
governance. So too is the spelling out of procedures for the  investigation,
evaluation and adjudication of customs duty and trade applications, as  well
as  the  spelling  out  of  the  functions  of   the   International   Trade
Administration Commission and the criteria for its composition.

In the regional context, the Bill both  affirms  and  anticipates  the  very
significant  historic  changes  foreseen  in  the  new   renegotiated   Sacu
agreement with Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland which was signed  by
our President and his Sacu counterparts only three weeks ago on  21  October
2002. The elevation of the signing of this agreement to  the  heads-of-state
level  symbolises  the  high  level  of   importance   attached   to   equal
participation and democratic decision-making which the  new  Sacu  agreement
introduces. It is also an expression of the free commitment of Sacu  leaders
to deeper regional economic integration and co-operation in our region.

The importance of these changes in South Africa's relations  with  our  Sacu
partners is clearer  when  one  considers  the  past  history  of  virtually
complete domination of the customs union by South Africa, because  what  was
clearly the case is that the members of  the  customs  union  were  not  all
equal in the arrangements  of  the  customs  union,  and  that  increasingly
created problems for South Africa. A range of difficulties  occurred,  there
being an assumption, for example,  that  anti-dumping  actions  we  took  as
South Africa were also applicable in the other Sacu member states.

It took the policy review of the WTO to point to us that this  was  actually
not the case, and that it  was  necessary  for  each  member  state  of  the
customs union to have a national centre of its  own  that  would  deal  with
these actions on behalf of their own nationals. It was also  the  case  that
South Africa was making decisions  on  tariffs  without  any  obligation  to
consult other member states of the customs union.

Accordingly,  straight  after  1994  we  embarked  on  some  very  difficult
negotiations around the Sacu. There were  two  areas  of  concern  in  these
negotiations, and that created the most difficult problems. The first one  -
the one I have just dealt with - was that, in  essence,  the  customs  union
was not democratic and did not allow for real economic integration  and  co-
operation.

Secondly, the revenue formula in that agreement, from South  Africa's  point
of view, led to the possibility that there would  be  a  distortion  of  the
moneys collected and the moneys to  be  paid.  Against  this  backdrop,  the
International Trade  Administration  Bill  is  a  progressive  and  forward-
looking piece of  legislation  in  making  provision  for  consultative  and
democratic decision-making between South Africa and  our  Sacu  partners  in
the administration of the customs union.

Clearly, in preparing to pass this Bill so soon after  the  signing  of  the
new Sacu agreement, we are making impressive progress  in  establishing  the
required governance infrastructure for economic growth, integration and  co-
operation in our region. However, there is still a lot of work to do and  we
shall have occasion to debate all this when the Sacu agreements come  before
this House for ratification in the new year.

In  conclusion,  I  wish  to  extend  our  sincere  gratitude  to  both  the
committees of Parliament and the  select  committee  of  the  NCOP  for  the
detailed, vigilant and constructive manner in which  they  dealt  with  this
Bill. I would particularly like  to  thank  the  select  committee  for  the
amendment before the House on which members are going to vote  later  today.
I would also like to thank the stakeholders who  debated,  participated  and
made submissions to the portfolio committee and this  committee  during  the
public hearings.

And whilst I am busy with gratitudes and thanks, I would like  to  sincerely
thank the chairperson of the committee, Mr  Mohseen  Moosa,  a  comrade  and
long-standing member of this Council, for leading this committee  thus  far.
We thank him for his vigilance, his incisive remarks  and  his  relationship
with the Department of Trade and Industry in particular, which  enabled  him
to ask the right questions at the right time, and for always keeping  us  on
our toes in terms of this Council's oversight task over the executive. I  am
hoping that as he leaves this august body to  go  to  greener  pastures,  he
will continue to add value to his partners, and whoever he is going to  work
with, in the same way that he has added value to this Council.

We are confident that in passing this Bill, this Council will  be  effecting
a major strengthening of  the  necessary  institutional  framework  for  the
continued growth of  this  economy  and  for  mutually  beneficial  economic
relations with our partners in Sacu. I hope that all  the  hon  members  and
parties represented here are going to support this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I want to thank the Deputy Minister for the  kind
words she expressed here. On many occasions I  have  had  the  privilege  of
working on historic pieces of legislation and laws that have had a very far-
reaching vision and impact.

In one of my last tasks in Parliament I once again rise - and  am  delighted
- to move the International Trade Administration Bill  before  this  Council
for adoption. This Bill is going to change the way in which trade  relations
take place in South Africa and Southern Africa. It is also going to  be  one
of the engines on which Nepad in the Southern African regions will rest.

It modernises the Board of  Tariffs  and  Trade  into  a  world-class  trade
administration in the form of Itac, the International  Trade  Administration
Commission. Simultaneously, it designs  international  trade  administration
to catapult the Sacu trade relations into a new phase.

The new Itac will play a massive role in trade administration  in  the  Sacu
region by providing support and assistance, and will serve as an example  to
the other regions and customs unions  in  the  rest  of  Africa  within  the
jurisdiction of the broad Nepad principles. It also  brings  together  eight
laws into one law in a creative and innovative fashion.

Under the able leadership of a rising star in our public  service,  the  new
Deputy  Director-General  for  International  Trade  and  my  former   Cosas
comrade, Mr Tshidiso Matona sitting  over  there,  as  well  as  Ms  Nomonde
Maimela, the present CEO of the Board of Tariffs  and  Trade,  who  will  no
doubt be the CEO of Itac - a bright, young and beautiful woman -  this  Bill
will usher in a new era in  South  African  trade  relations  and  in  trade
relations generally. African and offshore trade  are  predicted  to  be  the
largest growth points in our economy over the next 10 years, and we wish  Mr
Matona and his colleagues well in this job.

The committees of Parliament made amendments to this law during the  process
of passing it through Parliament. Amongst these, we changed the name of  the
body from Cita to Itac, in order to reduce confusion with other bodies  with
similar names. An important amendment was made during  the  NA  process,  in
order to take into consideration certain Cosatu viewpoints, when we  refined
the  objects  of  the  Bill  to  also  include  the  promotion  of   growth,
development, investment and employment in  the  Sacu  region  and  in  South
Africa generally. Many amendments were proposed by our provinces  and  their
committees. These were also taken on board.

I also want to  briefly  explain  the  amendment  that  appears  before  the
members of the House at the moment. What happened was, during  the  drafting
process we had the Sacu agreement which was signed about  two  weeks  ago  -
members will remember seeing it in the newspapers.  However,  the  agreement
has not come into effect yet, so we have a clause in the Bill that  suspends
the operation of certain parts of the Bill until the  Sacu  agreement  comes
into effect.

One of those is clause 16(3) of the Bill.  When  we  made  that  annotation,
instead of writing 16(3), somehow they wrote 16 as a whole, leaving out  the
(3), with the result that we  had  literally  suspended  all  the  important
things such as customs, duties, etc. In  fact,  there  would  have  been  no
point in passing this Bill if we left  the  clause  like  that.  So  we  are
really just correcting that, because it  was  never  the  intention  of  the
legislature to do that. We are  correcting  that  by  adding  ``(3)''  after
``16'' in order to clearly explain what  we  are  suspending,  ie  the  Sacu
agreement issues until that agreement comes into effect.
We also made a number of amendments which members  are  aware  of.  Many  of
them are just refinements and others an attempt to work  out  organisational
arrangements so that they work better. Some of them are  just  issues  of  a
legal nature, to ensure that the Bill is not challenged  in  the  future  or
that there are no loopholes through which people might slip  when  the  Bill
is effectively in operation.

I want to thank the provinces, members of our committee and provincial  MPLs
for all the good work they have done on this Bill. This is  my  second  last
speech in the NCOP. I have worked with the DTI for four years  now.  I  wish
to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  Deputy  Minister,  Ms   Lindiwe
Hendricks; the Minister, Mr Alec Erwin; Dr Alastair Ruiters,  the  Director-
General; Mr Matona and Mr Rudin, the two  new  deputy  Directors-General  of
the DTI; Mr Naidoo, who has been of great help to the committee and who  has
worked very well with this Council; and many others in  the  department  for
an engaging and exciting relationship during the past four years.

I leave the chair of the economic affairs committee with  sadness  and  fond
memories, as well as a deeper understanding of many things. This is  because
of the DTI, and I thank them for this. I wish them well in  their  important
work of driving the economy to higher levels, and  give  them  my  assurance
that I will be close by, continuing to work with them on some very  exciting
things I will also  be  doing  along  the  way  once  I  leave  this  place.
[Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister of Trade  and  Industry  and
colleagues,  the  purpose  of  this  Bill,  the  International   Trade   and
Administration Bill, is to establish a new body,  namely  the  International
Trade  Administration  Commission,  which  is  to  regulate  and  administer
international trade instruments. It will separate the  Department  of  Trade
and  Industry's  implementation  functions  from  its   administrative   and
regulatory functions. It  also  establishes  the  SA  Customs  Union  Tariff
Board, which  will  rely  on  national  bodies  to  undertake  a  number  of
supporting functions in formulating recommendations  on  a  common  external
tariff and trade remedies.

Daar is reeds 'n lang aanloop tot die wetsontwerp wat vandag ter  tafel  lê.
Die wetsontwerp vloei voort uit die Republiek  se  politieke  en  ekonomiese
beleidsverpligtinge en keuses waarvoor hy direk na die  eerste  demokratiese
verkiesing te staan gekom het,  naamlik  ekonomiese  hervorming  waarmee  'n
gesonde ekonomiese  onderbou  deur  middel  van  vervaardiging  en  uitvoere
verseker kon word; 'n hervormde handels- en tariefbeleid  as  grondslag  vir
die bevordering van doeltreffendheid en  mededingendheid  wat  weer  op  hul
beurt, as gevolg van laer koste en pryse, 'n heilsame invloed  op  die  land
se algemene welvaart sou hê;  en  die  demokratisering  van  Suid-Afrika  se
verhoudings met sy onmiddellike bure, naamlik  die  BLNS-landstate  met  wie
ons 'n gemeenskaplike doeanegebied deel, wat die heronderhandeling  van  die
Suider-Afrikaanse Doeane-unieooreenkoms van 1969 nodig gemaak het.

Die bekragtiging  van  die  Wêreldhandelsorganisasie-ooreenkomste  in  1995,
asook  ooreenkomste  tussen  die  Europese  Unie  en  die  Suider-Afrikaanse
Ontwikkelings- en Ekonomiese Gemeenskap vir die  bevordering  van  uitvoere,
inwaartse beleggings en streeksintegrasie, was ook verdere  aansporings  vir
die voortsetting van die tariefhervormingsproses.

Die beleidsbenadering ten  opsigte  van  handels-  en  tariefhervorming  het
onder andere ook ten doel om laer beskermingsvlakke vir insette in die  vorm
van kapitaalgoedere en grondstowwe, asook  vir  uitsette  in  die  vorm  van
vervaardigde goedere  te  verleen  sodat  Suid-Afrikaanse  firmas  in  staat
gestel word om hul insette op wêreldmarke te verkry en sodoende weer in  die
plaaslike en wêreldmark met hul produkte mee  te  ding.  Ten  einde  hierdie
doelwitte te bereik, is dit ook nodig dat die  doeanetariefstruktuur  verder
vereenvoudig word - waarvoor Suid-Afrika  in  1995  'n  onderneming  in  die
Wêreldhandelsorganisasie gegee het.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[There has already been a long run-up to  the  Bill  that  is  being  tabled
today. The Bill emanates from the Republic's political and  economic  policy
obligations and choices that it was faced  with  directly  after  the  first
democratic elections, namely economic transformation  that  could  ensure  a
healthy economic substructure through production and exports; a  transformed
trade and tariff policy as the basis for promoting efficacy and  competition
which in turn will have,  due  to  lower  costs  and  prices,  a  beneficial
influence on the country's general prosperity; and  the  democratisation  of
South Africa's relationships with its immediate neighbours, namely the  BLNS
states with whom we share a common  customs  territory,  that  has  made  it
necessary to renegotiate the 1969 Southern African Customs Agreement.

The ratification of the World Trade  Organisation  Agreements  in  1995,  as
well as agreements between the  European  Union  and  the  Southern  African
Development and Economic Community for  the  promotion  of  exports,  inward
investments and regional integration were also further  incentives  for  the
continuation of the tariff transformation process.

The policy approach regarding trade and tariff transformation is also  aimed
at rendering lower protection levels for  inputs  in  the  form  of  capital
goods and raw materials, compared  to  that  for  outputs  in  the  form  of
produced goods in order to enable  South  African  firms  to  procure  their
inputs on world markets  and  in  this  way  to  compete  again  with  their
products in the local and world markets. To realise these objectives, it  is
also necessary for the customs tariff structure to be simplified  even  more
- for which South Africa has given an  undertaking  in  1995  in  the  World
Trade Organisation.]

This Bill seeks to provide a framework to carry  out  South  Africa's  legal
obligations under the  Southern  African  Customs  Union  Agreement  and  to
establish the International  Trade  Administration  Commission,  which  will
carry  out  the  investigation  and  adjudication  of  international   trade
applications or complaints in the Republic. It  also  repeals  the  existing
Board of Tariffs and Trade Act and the present  Import  and  Export  Control
Act. The responsibility for  issuing  import  and  export  permits  will  be
assigned to the Itac.

The New NP agrees with the  establishment  of  an  efficient  and  effective
system for the administration of  international  trade,  which  will  foster
economic growth and industrial development in South Africa and within Sacu.

Before I end my speech, I would also like  to  add  my  good  wishes  to  my
colleague, Mohseen Moosa, in his new endeavours. I want to tell  him  to  go
out and make lots of money! [Laughter].

We support this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr E S MBATHA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister  and  hon
members of the Council, I think it is proper, before I make  my  speech,  to
actually thank the hon Minister for  introducing  this  wonderful  piece  of
legislation to the nation.

South Africa  has  since  1994  been  part  and  parcel  of  the  globalised
community of nations, and  a  leading  economic  and  social  force  in  the
Southern African region and the African continent. The Department  of  Trade
and  Industry,  in  its  effort  to  enhance  its  delivery  capacity,   has
introduced the International Trade Administration Bill of  2002.  This  Bill
has been designed to separate the DTI's implementation  functions  from  its
administrative and regulatory functions, and  is  in  line  with  up-to-date
international trends.

It is a Bill that streamlines the legal obligations  of  our  country  under
the Sacu agreement. It repeals a number of  important  Bills,  such  as  the
Board of Tariffs and Trade Act, Act 107 of 1986, and the Import  and  Export
Control Act, Act 45 of 1963. The main innovation of  the  new  Bill  is  the
creation of a new body, the International Trade  Administration  Commission,
Itac,  as  an  independent  body   that   will   regulate   and   administer
international trade instruments.

Its main responsibilities are very wide and varied, and  deal  with  alleged
dumping,  subsidised   exports   and   disruptive   competition.   It   also
investigates and evaluates applications for amendment of custom  duties,  as
well as the evaluation of issuing of  permits  in  respect  of  rebates  and
certificates in terms of the Customs and Excise Act  or  import  and  export
control permits.

The proposed Itac will have a full-time Chief Commissioner and Deputy  Chief
Commissioner, as well as up to 10 additional  full-time  members  and  part-
time commissioners. Its independence is guaranteed, and it is authorised  to
deal with established bodies in terms of the Sacu agreement.

It is up to Itac to investigate and evaluate applications received in  terms
of the various existing laws which need to be in accordance  with  the  Sacu
Tariffs Board regulations. General standards are set out  regarding  various
processes,  especially  the  dumping  of  goods.  It  will  also  carry  out
investigations and inspections, including searches. There are  a  number  of
stringent conditions regarding the enforcement of the Bill through  standard
offence  provisions,  especially  regarding   unauthorised   disclosure   of
confidential information and other such offences.

The setting up of Itac and the implementation of  the  Sacu  agreement  will
have serious financial implications for the country, as new structures  mean
that additional funds will be required.  The  present  calculations  do  not
stipulate figures for the years to come, as South Africa may bear the  costs
of additional adjustments to the  BLNS  states.  It  is  hoped  that  future
negotiations between  the  Minister  of  Finance  of  our  country  and  the
Ministers of the respective member states will be to  our  benefit.  If  the
Bill becomes law during the present financial year, a separate  budget  will
become a necessity as the body will be separate from the DTI.

Several state departments and Ministries were consulted in respect  of  this
Bill, such as the National Treasury,  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  the
Department of Foreign Affairs,  the  SA  Revenue  Service,  the  Competition
Commission and Nedlac.

However, it is felt that there are several  stakeholders  that  should  have
been consulted, as the Bill will most likely have repercussions in terms  of
dumping, environmental imbalances, import and export  regulations,  and  the
like. It is strongly felt that the private sector,  universities  and  other
researchers in the field, as well as NGOs and trade unions should have  been
widely consulted.

We feel  strongly  that  the  Bill  has  the  potential  to  streamline  the
implementation mechanisms of the DTI in  the  years  to  come.  Despite  the
feeling  that  the   new   proposed   mechanisms   will   possibly   further
bureaucratise the DTI, I just want to be on record as saying  that  KwaZulu-
Natal strongly supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr J L THERON: Agbare  Voorsitter,  Adjunk-Minister  en  kollegas,  hierdie
wetsontwerp voorsien 'n meer effektiewe wetlike en regulerende raamwerk  vir
internasionale handel, veral wat  betref  'n  doeane-unie.  Die  wetsontwerp
stig 'n onafhanklike Kommissie vir Internasionale Handel  en  Administrasie,
of KIHA, om internasionale handel en tariewe tussen  lede  van  die  doeane-
unie lede te reguleer en te administreer.

Die doelwit van die wetsontwerp is om ekonomiese groei  en  ontwikkeling  in
Suider-Afrika  te  versterk   en   om   inkomstevlakke,   indiensneming   en
investering te verhoog deur  'n  effektiewe  en  doeltreffende  stelsel  vir
internasionale handel  daar  te  stel.  Die  Demokratiese  Party  ondersteun
natuurlik hierdie doelwitte en sal alles in ons vermoë doen om te  help  dat
hierdie doelwitte realiseer.

Die Suider-Afrika doeane-unie het natuurlik baie voordele  vir  Suid-Afrika:
Die totale mark het ongeveer 6  miljoen  mense  wat  groter  afset  moontlik
maak; 'n bruto binnelandse produk van meer as R60  biljoen;  Suid-Afrika  se
uitvoere na die res van die unie is meer as R29 biljoen;  invoer  vanaf  die
unie is meer as R7 biljoen;  die  doeane-unie  help  mee  om  ekonomiese  en
politieke stabiliteit in  Suider-Afrika  te  bevorder;  en  die  doeane-unie
verskaf 'n platform vir groter internasionale ekonomiese integrasie.

Hierdie voordele kan natuurlik verder uitgebou word deur 'n meer  effektiewe
internasionale handelsraamwerk wat hierdie wetsontwerp se doelwit is.

Die belangrikste of sleutelbepalings van die  wetsontwerp  sluit  in:  Behou
die vrye handel tussen die doeane-unielede  en  gee  gemeenskaplike  tariewe
vir handel; pas die inkomste uit die doeane-unie aan; stig nuwe  instellings
om die doeane-unie te administreer en te implementeer; voorsien die  doeane-
unie van 'n hoofkwartier en voorsien 'n gemeenskaplike  beleid  oor  handel,
doeane,    landbou,    industrie,     mededinging     en     'n     dispuut-
beslegtigingsmeganisme.  Die  Demokratiese  Party  ondersteun   al   hierdie
genoemde  sleutelbepalings  en  vertrou  dat  die   voordele   van   hierdie
wetsontwerp sal realiseer, en daarom ondersteun ons dit graag.

Ek wil graag ook afsluit deur die agb Mohseen Moosa sterkte toe te wens  vir
die nuwe weivelde wat hy gaan betree,  en  ons  hoop  is  dat  hierdie  nuwe
weivelde vir hom baie vrugbaar sal wees. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Hon Chairperson, Deputy Minister and colleagues,  this  Bill
offers a more effective legal and  regulatory  framework  for  international
trade, particularly in respect of a customs union. The Bill  establishes  an
independent Commission for International Trade and Administration, or  ITAC,
so as to regulate and administer international  trade  and  tariffs  between
customs union members.

The objective of the Bill is to reinforce economic  growth  and  development
in  Southern  Africa,  and  to  increase  income  levels,   employment   and
investment  by  establishing  an  effective   and   efficient   system   for
international trade. Of course, the DP  supports  these  objectives  and  we
will do everything in our power to help realise them.

Of course, the Southern African customs union has many advantages for  South
Africa: The total market involves about 6  million  people,  which  makes  a
larger sale  turnover  possible;  a  gross  domestic  product  of  over  R60
billion; South Africa's exports to the rest of the union amount to over  R29
billion; imports from the union stand  at  R7  billion;  the  customs  union
assists in promoting economic and political stability  in  Southern  Africa;
and the customs union provides  a  platform  for  increased  world  economic
integration.

These advantages  can  of  course  be  extended  through  a  more  effective
international trade framework, which is the objective of this Bill.

The most important or key provisions of the Bill include: Retain free  trade
between customs union members and extend joint  trade  tariffs;  adjust  the
revenue from the customs union; establish  new  institutions  to  administer
and  implement  the  customs  union;  provide   the   customs   union   with
headquarters and provide a joint  policy  on  trade,  customs,  agriculture,
industry, competition and a dispute settlement mechanism.  The  DP  supports
all of the said key provisions and trusts that the advantages of  this  Bill
will be realised, and we therefore gladly support it.

I would like to conclude by wishing the hon  Mohseen  Moosa  well  regarding
the new pastures that he is about to set foot on, and  we  hope  that  these
new pastures will be very fertile for him.]

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chair, hon Deputy Minister and hon members,  we  are  living
in an era where physical borders between countries are eroding.  Central  to
that is the international trade that takes place between  countries  through
their imports and exports.

In the times that we live in, no country can truly survive  without  trading
with others, because the reality is that today's  economic  success  of  any
country is not only linked to, but also depends  on  how  well  that  nation
trades with other nations.

It is true that the challenges facing economies,  in  particular  developing
economies, are to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  their  citizens;  to
increase  job  opportunities;  and  to  ensure  economic  growth  which   is
sustainable. International  trade  plays  a  very  important  role  in  that
regard. How it is administered is even more fundamental.  Therefore,  it  is
the object of this Bill to foster economic growth and development  in  order
to raise incomes and promote investment and employment in the  Republic  and
within the customs area by establishing an efficient  and  effective  system
for the administration of international trade.

It is a  fact  that  globalisation  comes  with  its  own  challenges.  With
countries trading among each other comes problems such as those of  dumping,
drug smuggling - the list is endless. These  are,  therefore,  some  of  the
reasons why international trade needs  to  be  administered.  This  Bill  is
based, among others, on that premise.

Dumping, which refers to the introduction of goods into the Republic  or  in
the common customs area at an export price that  is  less  than  the  normal
value of those goods, is bad for any economy that seeks to flourish and  for
developing countries in particular,  which  many  a  times  are  victims  of
dumping and often bear the consequences. It is thus important  to  put  laws
in place that protect  their  democracies  against  dumping.  Therefore,  by
improving on the administration of our trade, we also  protect  our  economy
against the consequences of dumping.

This Bill  further  provides  for  the  International  Trade  Administration
Commission to  investigate  and  evaluate  alleged  subsidised  exports  and
disruptive competition  with  this  amendment  and  for  the  Commission  to
monitor, review and report to the Minister on matters that may  be  assigned
to it from time to time.

To conclude, if trade is properly administered in any economy, the  economic
environment becomes more viable for business and investment, as well as  the
growth of local industries, in particular infant  industries,  thus  further
contributing to the prosperity of that economy.

The ANC supports this Bill and also  encourages  all  the  members  of  this
Council to do so. [Applause.]

Mr E RASOOL (Western Cape): Mr Chairperson, Deputy Minister and  colleagues,
I think the International Trade and Administration Bill comes at  about  the
right time for South Africa, and more so for the Western Cape. In a  rapidly
globalising world we - particularly in this province, but elsewhere as  well
- have gone through the pain of  the  deregulation  tariffs,  especially  in
sectors like the clothing and textile industry.

However, I think even that industry is beginning to see that  we  are  going
to reap the benefits of inserting ourselves fully into a  new  international
trade regime. We have done that through the  process  of  repositioning  key
industries like the clothing industry in particular, as  well  as  the  wine
industry in the Western Cape, so as to utilise the  opportunities  available
for international trade. The full exploitation of  key  international  trade
agreements for exports, in particular,  and  the  favourable  exchange  rate
have helped in our general connectivity  with  the  world.  We  also  import
products from the rest of the world.
We understand that, at this point, this Bill helps us to enhance  our  trade
capacity and to also defend ourselves against negative trade practices  such
as dumping, which has been spoken about before. We are saying that it  comes
at the right time, because it replaces outdated legislation with  regard  to
administrating trade.

So what we are saying is that for  the  administrative  procedures  to  give
effect to  the  SA  Customs  Union  agreement  and  to  set  up  a  regional
commission  for  international  trade  administration,  it   is   absolutely
critical to set out the procedures, particularly those detailed  in  Chapter
4 of the Bill, which we believe is generally well thought out and are  solid
in their approach.

However, there is one area of concern that we do have, and that is that  the
procedure is likely to take approximately six months to  take  effect.  This
is acceptable in usual circumstances, but we believe that  for  us  to  move
rapidly and utilise the full effect of  this  Bill,  there  may  be  certain
exceptional or urgent circumstances that may require some fast-tracking.  We
are hoping that that will be dealt with in some way or other.

We are also encouraged by the fact that  this  Bill  has  passed  through  a
number of relevant stakeholder entities, including Nedlac, which means  that
their concerns have also been addressed. We also  think  -  even  though  we
support the Bill - that we need to create an independent  body  to  regulate
and administer international trade, as well as establish a Southern  African
customs union tariff board. We think that that would be useful,  because  it
would allow Government to get on with its core task  of  implementing  trade
policy and strategies, and ensuring that there is concomitant growth.

We need to bring out - this is not spelt out  clearly  in  the  definitions,
but we are not, at this point, recommending any amendments to it - the  fact
that independence refers  to  the  perceived  professional  conduct  of  the
commission, in the sense that no member of the commission or  party  related
to the fulfilling of any tasks that are in the interest  of  the  commission
should have any direct or indirect business or  personal  relationship  with
the parties applying for any matter to be considered by the commission.

We also want to further enhance the discussion around the notion of  experts
that is  contained  in  the  Bill,  which  we  think  should  represent  the
interests of important sectors or provinces. That  specialist  interest  and
knowledge about  the  different  sectors  or  even,  for  that  matter,  the
provinces should be contained in the definition of an expert.

It is in that context that I  feel  fairly  happy  that  both  our  standing
committee at the provincial level  and  our  economics  cluster  within  the
Western Cape government have full confidence in this Bill.

On behalf of the Western Cape, we support the Bill without  any  amendments.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairperson, may I just add my  congratulations  and  that
of my party to our colleague, Mr Moosa, who goes off now to earn  his  bread
and an honest day's living in the private sector. We wish him well. We  hope
that we will see him here from time to time,  and  he  knows  that  he  will
always have friends here.

My hon colleague, Mr Theron, talked about the balance of  trade  between  us
and the BLLS countries, and he spoke about a favourable  balance  of  trade.
This is quite interesting, if one looks at that,  because  not  only  do  we
have a favourable balance of trade with them, but the quality of  our  trade
is very good in the sense that we  export  to  them  much  more  value-added
goods than we do to Europe, South East Asia and so on. [Interjections.]

The benefits for them, of course, is the fact  that  they  are  getting  the
economies of scale of access to  our  economy,  because  many  of  them  are
landlocked micro states with small populations. Of course, they also do  not
have access to a home market, effectively making  South  Africa  their  home
market. Without access to such  a  market,  they  would  never  be  able  to
develop at all.

They also have the economies of scale of our  infrastructure.  For  example,
they have access to the cheapest electric power in the world. Were  they  to
generate their own power, it would be 10 times the price  they  are  paying.
So there is  a  huge  trade-off.  There  are  huge  benefits  for  everybody
concerned.

There are conflicts because, to date, when South Africa raised high  tariffs
to protect the industry in South Africa, the trade-off  for  them  was  that
they would receive the benefits of those tariffs.  Up  to  80%  of  some  of
these countries' budgets were income from that pool.

Of course, as we reduce and  continue  to  implode  the  tariffs,  so  their
incomes will come down, but hopefully this will be balanced by  an  increase
in economic  activity.  We  should  also  encourage  people  to  locate  new
investors with greenfields operations in those countries.

From the private sector's point of view, we will continue to need  decisions
that must be professional, swift  and  accessible.  I  like  the  fast-track
device that the amendment is bringing in. It is essential, because if  there
is dumping, nobody can wait for eight, nine months or  even  a  year  for  a
group of Ministers  to  meet.  It  is  impossible.  The  industry  does  not
function like that.

Also, the border posts will have to be very effective and efficient.  It  is
going to mean upgrading, not only of our own, but also perhaps some  of  our
neighbours' borders in the level of efficiency, effectiveness, training  and
so on. I see in the Revenue Bill  that  we  passed  in  the  committee  this
morning that there  is  a  provision  for  a  multinational  customs  device
whereby a country can have one border post for two  or  more  countries,  so
that  the  public  does  not  have  to   go   through   two   border   posts
simultaneously.

So there is going to be a great need for training and upgrading because  not
only does the border of South Africa now become the outer parameter  of  the
BMLS, but we also have to protect our international agreements, for  example
our agreements with America.

America opened their most favoured agreements to South Africa,  and  not  to
India or China who want to locate their factories here in  South  Africa  in
order to get under  the  tariff  wall  in  America  by  sewing  labels  into
garments in our part of the world. I am sure the hon Minister  is  aware  of
that, but it is something one can only cure if one has an effective  customs
regime, so that training will be very important indeed.

However, we support this legislation. It is good  legislation  which  brings
us closer, from our point of view. It  also  builds  our  market  size  and,
although it is small in relation to our total market, at the margins  it  is
very important. As the hon Minister knows, it is at the margins where  one's
production is the most profitable.
We support the legislation. [Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, Deputy Minister, hon members, we  in  Mpumalanga
welcome the introduction of the International Trade Administration Bill  for
reasons that will be explained hereafter. Hon members will recall  that  the
South African Custom Union, as implemented by the apartheid regime prior  to
the ascension to power of the ANC-led  Government  in  1994,  highlighted  a
number of serious problems.

Amongst them was a formula-based sharing of the proceeds  of  trade  between
the Sacu members. This membership included the so-called TBVC states,  which
were essentially and  factually  part  of  South  Africa.  The  formula  was
therefore skewed in favour of South Africa, which led to the  continued  but
unfair economic domination of South Africa over all the other  members.  The
earnings of the workers from what was then called  the  neighbouring  states
from the mines of South Africa  were  part  of  the  formula.  Surely  these
earning were not part of the trade?

As a result of this formula-based  agreement  other  members,  except  South
Africa, were not encouraged to develop their  export  potential  and  became
increasingly dependent on South Africa for most of their consumer needs.  It
is therefore commendable that the object of the Bill, as clearly stated,  is
to foster economic growth and the development of industry  in  the  Republic
and within the common custom area.

As  a  province  which  shares  borders  with  two  SADC  countries,  namely
Swaziland and Mozambique, and a province with a strong industrial  base,  we
welcome the following provisions in the Bill. Firstly, the Minister's  power
to regulate imports and exports: The dumping of  foreign  cheap  goods  into
the local economy has serious economic repercussions.  For  example,  prices
in  the  local  market  become  distorted,  demand  is  affected  and  local
production stagnates. The only  winner  in  this  instance  is  the  foreign
country which is dumping.

Secondly,  the  establishment  and   functions   of   the   Commission   for
International  Trade  Administration:  The  commission  is  independent  and
subject only to the Constitution and the law. This will ensure  impartiality
and fairness in the dispensing of its mandate,  especially  with  regard  to
customs duty, antidumping, countervailing duties and other functions.
We note with  appreciation  that  the  Bill  provides  for  the  sharing  of
information with Sacu institutions and member  states.  This  provision,  in
our view, will ensure that the playing fields of knowledge  and  information
is  indeed  levelled,  and  that  in  the  process  cordial  relations   are
established and maintained. The maintenance of such relations  will  require
enforcement. For legislation to be effectively and efficiently  implemented,
there should be enforcement mechanisms in place.

In conclusion, it is in the interests of  the  masses  of  the  province  to
eradicate poverty and grow the economy. This can only  be  achieved  through
this  Bill.  We  in  Mpumalanga  support   the   International   Trade   and
Administration Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, hon members,  the  object  of
the Bill is very crucial  to  the  provinces  as  it  focuses  on  fostering
economic growth and development  in  order  to  raise  incomes  and  promote
investment and employment in the Republic  and  within  the  common  customs
area. Therefore, those who  will  receive  anything  from  this  Bill  will,
without any doubt, be our provinces. It is a fact that  trade  is  important
in any democracy. Furthermore, the administration  of  trade  is  even  more
important, for if not administered,  the  result  will  be  drastic  to  the
economic growth of that democracy.

Allow me to highlight some points of interest from  our  province,  Limpopo.
The very first point is that we are interested in the marketing  regulations
for agricultural products that are to be put in place,  as  our  economy  in
Limpopo largely rests on agriculture. Secondly, we are  also  interested  in
the protection of the infant industry as opposed  to  the  survival  of  the
fittest, looking at the number of years that are given  to  that  particular
industry. We are also looking forward to  the  antidumping,  countervailling
and safeguarding measures that are supposed to  be  put  in  place  by  this
Bill.

Let us now look at the institutional set-up. The Council of  Ministers  will
be the supreme decision-making body and will be working with the  commission
- a tribunal which will be composed of an independent body  of  experts.  We
are also looking at where  the  secretariat  is  going  to  be  located.  Of
greatest importance is the revenue-sharing formula, the  management  of  the
revenue pool and then the determination of the excise duties.
We as the Limpopo province are also looking  at  the  transitional  measures
that are supposed to be put in  place  and  the  determination  of  the  old
agreement that the Deputy Minister  alluded  to  not  long  ago.  This  Bill
further tightens the bond and economic relations with our neighbours, as  it
provides for the implementation of certain aspects of the  Southern  African
Customs Union, Sacu, agreement in the Republic. It further makes  provision,
within the framework of the Sacu agreement, for  the  continued  control  of
the import and export of goods and the amendment of custom duties.

It is important to note that some  provinces  are  directly  linked  to  the
neighbouring countries.  For  instance,  my  province  strategically  shares
borders with Botswana, Zimbabwe  and  Mozambique,  which  are  some  of  our
important trading partners in the Southern Sahara. Botswana is also part  of
the Southern African Customs Union. Therefore, I would not be pompous  if  I
say that my province prides  itself  on  its  strategic  location  which  is
viable for economic activity, hence the change  from  Northern  Province  to
Limpopo.

It is not called the gateway to the  rest  of  Africa  for  no  reason.  The
international airport at Polokwane, which is on  its  way  to  becoming  the
gateway to Africa, is contributing to our economic development,  linking  us
to our neighbours, and is central to our trade  relations  and  development.
To us the Maputo Corridor, which will  be  a  major  route,  will  link  the
province directly to the Mozambican port,  creating  development  and  trade
opportunities, particularly in the province. It is important  to  note  that
the province link with Maputo has been declared the main corridor.

Diverse and internationally renowned mining  operations  contribute  20%  of
the value of Limpopo's economic production, making this the  primary  driver
of economic activity after  the  government  services.  Substantial  mineral
reserves include the platinum group metals, diamonds,  coal,  chrome,  iron,
iron ore and copper. The  province  exports  primary  products  and  imports
goods  and  services.  It  is  an  attractive  location  for  investors.  An
extensive range of economic activities in this province  serves  the  widely
dispersed population and also caters for the needs of its neighbours.

The  Limpopo  province's  investment  initiative,  the  province's  official
marketing and investment promotion authority,  assist  investors  to  access
project  finance;  obtain  exports  and  imports,  targeting  mining;   agro
processing and eco-tourism. Owing to the above facts, I  am  sure  that  one
can see the important role  that  trade  is  playing  and  can  play  in  my
province. Therefore, by establishing the International Trade  Administration
Commission,  Itac,  whose  function  will  include  the  investigation   and
evaluation  of   alleged   dumping,   subsidised   export   and   disruptive
competition, this ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  I  would  like  to
thank the hon members who spoke on  this  Bill  and  explained  the  details
thereof. Indeed, as they have noted, this is by far the most  advanced  form
of economic  integration  on  the  African  continent  and,  frankly,  as  a
structure it probably rates with any other  structure  in  the  world  today
because of its comparative and participative dimensions.

I would like to say that I could not agree more with the  comments  made  by
Dr Conroy. I thank him for the detail on the restructuring  of  our  economy
from an inward to an outward-looking one, with very positive spinoffs.

I also thank Mr Mbatha for the detailed information on the  composition  and
the duties of the commission. Indeed he is correct in  saying  that,  whilst
we have a budget for Seta, more money will be needed in order to set up  the
institutions that are required by this legislation. I would not  agree  with
him, though, that more  consultation  would  have  improved  this  piece  of
legislation.

It is our view that the  Bill  has  undergone  extensive  consultation  with
members of both Houses of Parliament, as well as all the  stakeholders  that
are relevant to the Bill and to its substance. It  is  also  our  view  that
there  must  be  a  balance  between  consultation,  getting  to  work   and
implementation. So we are very confident that  the  inputs  of  stakeholders
have been taken into account by the committees and are actually effected  in
the amendments that are part of the Bill.

I have noted the comments  of  Mr  Rasool.  Indeed,  they  are  very  useful
comments. I think some of them have been taken care of  by  the  amendments,
but most of them will be dealt with in terms of the  regulations  that  will
form part of the implementation of this legislation.

Mr Durr's comments are noted. Indeed, whilst we have  said  the  balance  of
trade between us and our BLS neighbours is  favourable,  it  is  not  always
healthy to have a favourable balance with one's trading partners. So  he  is
correct to say in his own breath that we ourselves need to  ensure  that  we
help our partners to actually improve and diversify their own production.

It is our duty as South Africans to help our partners, not only in  the  BLS
region, but also those in the SADC region,  to  try  to  improve  their  own
industrial base, to move to manufacturing, to  diversify  their  production,
and to beneficiate their products so that at the end of the day there  is  a
balance in terms of intra-Africa trade.

Having said that, I would like to thank all hon members  for  their  support
for this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the following amendment be agreed to: That  clause  64(2)
of the International Trade Administration Bill  [B38D-2002]  be  amended  by
substituting ``16'' in line 31 of page 25 with ``16(3)''.

Declaration of vote:

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, the hon members must  know  that  we  come  from
different provinces and we do not have ancestors who will  speak  on  behalf
of other provinces. Owing to the short notice that the province  of  Gauteng
has been given, we are unable to adopt the amendments because they were  not
processed on time in the legislature.

Therefore the Gauteng province, unfortunately, is  unable  to  vote  for  or
against the Bill, due to the problem that I have cited.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga,  Northern
Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

ABSTAIN: Gauteng.

Amendment accordingly agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution.

Question put: That the Bill, as amended, be agreed to.

Declaration of vote:

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, Gauteng still stands by its position.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga,  Northern
Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

ABSTAIN: Gauteng.

Bill, as amended, accordingly agreed to in accordance  with  section  65  of
the Constitution.

                           PATENTS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  the
second amendments that I am presenting to  the  House  today  are  the  ones
proposed to the Patents Act. These amendments are largely technical.

However, there is one major substantive amendment  proposed.  I  will  first
present  the  technical   amendments,   and   thereafter   the   substantive
amendments.  The  proposed  technical   amendments   relate   primarily   to
clarifying sections of the Act that  are  either  inconsistent  or  unclear.
These are the following.

Sections 32 and 61 require amendments to bring the wording  of  the  Act  in
line with that of article 29(1) of the TRIPS Agreement. It is proposed  that
various clauses under section 43 be amended with an insertion of  the  words
``National phase of an international application''. This  will  clarify  the
relationship that South African patent registrations have with  the  process
of international applications.

Further, there are changes  proposed  to  several  sections  to  ensure  the
consistent use of language.  Some  sections  refer  to  the  disposal  of  a
patent, whereas others refer to the sale of  a  patented  article.  Further,
certain sections require amendment as they refer to a  section  of  the  Act
which was amended in 1997. As a  result  of  the  amendments  they  are  now
referring to the correct section of the Act.

The second area I referred to earlier is the substantive change to the  Act.
This relates to section 69(a) of the Act on the introduction  of  the  early
working of  a  patent.  The  purpose  of  this  amendment  is  primarily  to
facilitate access to cheaper medication, as well as  to  promote  our  local
pharmaceutical industry. As the Patents Act currently  stands,  no  one  may
conduct research into or develop an alternative to a product with an  active
patent.

Also, products may not be approved by the relevant authority,  such  as  the
Medicines Control Council, before the patent expires. For  example,  when  a
particular medicine has an active  patent,  no  generic  substitute  may  be
developed in South Africa until the patent  expires.  Furthermore,  no  drug
may be registered or approved during this period. This  has  the  effect  of
extending the term of the patent by the period that it takes to  register  a
new drug or a generic substitute.

It, furthermore, disadvantages our domestic industry, as many foreign  firms
do not have to wait for the expiry of the patents  in  their  own  countries
and can start conducting research and  developing  the  products.  Once  the
patent expires in South Africa, they can register the  substitute  with  the
MCC and import their product as soon as it is approved. However,  our  local
industry can only begin to research and develop an alternative product  when
the patent has expired, as they cannot obtain access  to  the  specification
of the medicines. They are placed at a disadvantage in comparison  with  our
international producers of generic medicines.

The amendment seeks to allow  research  and  development,  as  well  as  the
registration of products to be allowed during the time  of  the  patent,  as
long as that is done for noncommercial use. Similar provisions  are  applied
in international jurisdictions such the  USA,  Canada,  Australia,  the  EU,
India and Israel. In some countries these provisions have been coupled  with
the extension  of  patents  for  the  period  that  approval  takes  or  the
exclusivity of data for a particular period of time.

These amendments do not propose  similar  provisions,  as  data  exclusivity
should be dealt with by the relevant approval authority, such  as  the  MCC.
More work  is  required  to  determine  whether  patent  term  extension  is
required. However, our initial assessment was that it was not necessary.  As
the Department of Trade  and  Industry  we  will  engage  further  with  the
industry and the MCC in this regard.

In conclusion, the  proposed  amendments  are  in  line  with  international
practice and the TRIPS Agreement. They seek to facilitate access to  cheaper
medicines on the one hand, and to promote our local pharmaceutical  industry
on the other.

I table the amendments before this House. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  I  have  been
informed that the Whips have agreed that there will be one  debate  for  the
third, fourth and fifth Orders of the Day.

                       MEDICAL SCHEMES AMENDMENT BILL

               MEDICINES AND RELATED SUBSTANCES AMENDMENT BILL

           OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES IN MINES AND WORKS AMENDMENT BILL

               (Consideration of Bills and of Reports thereon)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, it was indeed a pleasant  surprise  for
me when I learnt that the NCOP had decided  to  debate  these  three  Bills.
They could not have taken a better decision, because even though  these  are
three separate Bills, they are closely related and are the  cornerstones  of
the transformation of the health sector in our  country.  The  ANC  promised
the people of South Africa universal access to affordable  health  care  and
these Bills go a long way towards achieving this objective.

The first Bill that I would like to address is  the  Medicines  and  Related
Substances Amendment Bill. Hon members will recall  this  Bill's  particular
history in South Africa and the world as a whole. We passed Act 90  of  1997
in this Council, but were held to ransom  by  the  pharmaceutical  industry.
This ended up in a long and drawn-out court battle, but at the  end  of  the
day  a  last-minute  settlement  justified  our  firm  adherence  to   these
principles.

I would like to outline very briefly the key principles that  are  enshrined
in the Bill which I am asking  the  hon  members  to  approve.  The  overall
objective of this Bill is to ensure that all South Africans have  access  to
safe, efficacious and quality medicines at affordable costs.  Among  others,
this  will  be  achieved  through  generic  substitution.  When  a   patient
purchases medicine from a pharmacy, the pharmacist is obliged to inform  the
patient of any cheaper and equivalent generic drug and that he  is  free  to
exercise his choice regarding which medicine he wants to buy. The public  is
often deceived and swayed  to  believe  that  generic  medicines  are  cheap
because they are of a poor  quality  and  not  as  effective  as  brand-name
drugs. I want to tell hon members now that nothing  could  be  further  from
the truth. Those whose profits are  threatened  by  this  Bill  resist  this
progressive change and are responsible for spreading this propaganda.
The Bill promotes the rational use of medicine  by  prescribers,  dispensers
and patients through provision of  the  necessary  training,  education  and
information. Anyone who is licensed to dispense medicines will therefore  be
obliged to attend a course to learn about  good  dispensing  practices.  The
Bill makes it very  difficult  for  the  prescriber  and  the  dispenser  of
medicines to be influenced  by  pharmaceutical  companies  through  perverse
incentives. This means that there will be  no  incentive  for  a  doctor  to
prescribe for a patient a specific medicine for any reason, because this  is
a drug of choice for the condition of the patient and  this  Bill  therefore
eliminates these perversive incentives.

The Bill promotes the  local  production  of  medicines,  which  means  that
medicines should be cheaper, while supporting local  production  means  that
one supports local economic development, including the creation of jobs,  to
grow our economy. The Bill will also make  it  possible  for  the  Medicines
Control Council to work effectively and efficiently. The  Medicines  Control
Council is the body that is  appointed  by  the  Minister  to  register  all
medicines that are introduced into our country. This is  a  body  comprising
scientists and experts with diverse skills which are necessary  to  do  this
work  effectively,  using  technically  sound  and  objective  criteria  and
guidelines to license medicines and clinical trials.

Only last week the National Assembly passed an amendment to the Patents  Act
and this Council has just done so  too.  This  amendment  will  promote  the
early introduction of generic medicines into  the  market  and  this  is  an
important step  towards  the  promotion  of  local  manufacture  of  generic
medicines. The Medicines and Related Substances  Amendment  Bill  will  also
facilitate the appointment of a pricing  committee  that  will  introduce  a
transparent pricing system  which  will  clearly  indicate  the  price,  the
professional fee and the wholesale and distribution fees. This  will  assist
the Department of Health in identifying the major cost drivers  of  medicine
prices and introduce measures to contain them.  I  implore  hon  members  to
support this Bill before us today.

Similarly, I would like them to consider the Medical Schemes Amendment  Bill
which is also before this Council. This amendment Bill will  strengthen  the
legislative  framework  to  protect  consumers  in   the   medical   schemes
environment. Health care brokers are an integral component  of  the  medical
schemes environment and, to the extent that brokers conduct  their  business
professionally and are motivated by the best interests of the  clients  they
serve, they can significantly advance the policy objectives of  the  Medical
Schemes Act and contribute to  a  stable  and  sustainable  medical  schemes
environment. However, if professional standards are allowed to slip  and  if
perverse financial and other incentives influence  the  advice  and  service
providers by brokers, negative repercussions are  experienced  by  consumers
and the medical schemes industry as a whole.

The purpose of this legislation therefore is to ensure that  the  incentives
of brokers are as far as possible aligned with interests  of  the  consumers
they serve, and that brokers are awarded  appropriately  for  genuine  value
added. The Medical Schemes Amendment Bill,  read  in  conjunction  with  the
Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Bill,  commonly  known  as  the
FAIS Bill, will go  a  long  way  towards  ensuring  that  professional  and
minimum  ethical  standards  are  maintained  among  brokers  and  that  the
incentives of brokers are aligned with the interests  of  their  clients.  I
would therefore like to assure the hon members that this Bill is  absolutely
in compliance with and complementary to the FAIS Bill.

I would like to  discuss  the  Occupational  Diseases  in  Mines  and  Works
Amendment Bill. In the past occupational health was treated as a  Cinderella
service. Over 1 million workers  who  die  from  work-related  diseases  and
injuries throughout the world  annually  demonstrate  this  fact.  In  South
Africa the burden  of  disease  resulting  from  working  in  the  mines  is
unacceptably  high.  Approximately  25  000  compensation  applications  are
received annually for occupational lung diseases resulting from  working  in
the mines. Types of diseases that commonly occur are silicosis,  asbestosis,
coal mines pneumoconiosis and chronic obstruction of the airways -  diseases
which are caused by inhaling dust in the mines.

In order to continually improve the efficiency of  the  system  and  prevent
backlogs, consultations were held with  relevant  stakeholders.  In  1997  a
tripartite committee was convened to do this work. This committee  consisted
of the following  stakeholders:  the  National  Union  of  Mineworkers;  the
Mineworkers Union; the Chamber of Mines; and the Departments of  Health  and
of Minerals and Energy. The primary task of the tripartite committee was  to
consider sections of the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act  which
affected its efficient administration. This was necessitated  by  amendments
to the Act in 1994 which made its interpretation and  administration  a  bit
difficult. The tripartite committee made three important recommendations.

The first amendment relates to the change in the period  for  re-examination
of ex-mineworkers. Currently the Act states that an ex-mineworker can be re-
examined, but the Director of the Medical Bureau  of  Occupational  Diseases
can refuse this request if the period of re-examination  is  less  than  six
months. However, research by the  WHO  on  public  health  surveillance  and
International Labour  Organisation  standards  indicate  that  the  6-month-
period is too short and needs to be extended to 24 months due  to  the  slow
progression of the compensatable diseases which are not detectable by  x-ray
within a short period of six months. In addition, the frequent  exposure  to
6-monthly  x-rays  negatively  affects  the  health   of   the   individual.
Furthermore, there is a safeguard in this amendment Bill, which states  that
if a doctor has seen the ex-miner and has given a letter  of  referral,  the
24-month period does not apply.
The second amendment relates to the issue of  who  is  responsible  for  the
payment of the medical costs  of  the  ex-mineworker.  Section  36A  of  the
principal Act is amended to provide that the owner of a controlled  mine  or
a works shall from the date of commencement of a compensatable  disease  pay
the legitimate and proven costs related to medical care incurred  by  or  on
behalf of a person in his or her service, or who was in his service  at  the
commencement of a compensatable disease. The Bill places the  responsibility
for  compensation  on  the  employer  of  a  mine  where  the  disease   was
contracted, even if the mineworker has moved to work for another employer.

The third amendment relates to problems we have  been  experiencing  by  the
unscrupulous behaviour of certain persons representing or  assisting  people
who are claiming compensation. More often than not, these people who  assist
ex-mineworkers end up with the lion's  share  of  what  is  awarded  to  the
claimants. This Bill makes it a criminal offence for any person who  assists
a mineworker in claiming compensation to charge exorbitant fees. It does  so
by setting a limit of 0.5% of the payable amount as the maximum that can  be
taken by the intermediary.

I now put before the Council these three Bills. By approving  the  Medicines
and Related Substances Amendment Bill, all South Africans will  have  access
to affordable, safe, efficacious and quality  medicines.  By  approving  the
Medical Schemes Amendment Bill, the practices of brokers will  be  regulated
in line with our health policy objectives and  the  ethical  guidelines  set
out  by  the  Financial  Services  Board.  And  finally,  by  approving  the
Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works  Amendment  Bill,  we  will  ensure
that mineworkers will enjoy better health care and  compensation  when  they
contract diseases in their work environment.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the team  of  officials  from
my department, led by  the  Director-General  Dr  A  N  Tsaluba,  for  their
sterling work and their contribution to the effecting of  these  amendments.
Let me also express my deepest  appreciation  to  the  Select  Committee  on
Social Services for debating these Bills and coming to an agreement  on  the
proposed amendments. In a special way I would like to congratulate  the  hon
Ms  Jacobus,  chairperson  of  this  committee,  for  her   leadership   and
facilitation of a very robust debate in the select committee.
I implore this Council to support these three important amendment  Bills  to
ensure that all South Africans,  and  in  particular  the  mineworker,  have
universal access to basic health care and are  protected  from  unscrupulous
practitioners in the health care sector. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, I am being intimidated by colleagues here at  the
back.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  You  are  very  much  protected.  Dr
Conroy, please do not intimidate the member!

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, hon Minister and members of the House - I am  not
sure if there are still special delegates around -  all  three  Bills  under
discussion today reflect minor amendments on  paper,  but  with  significant
and far-reaching consequences for our people.

These three Bills reflect the commitment of this  Government  to  accessible
and affordable health care in order to improve the quality of  life  of  its
citizens. In speaking  about  these  three  Bills,  I  will  just  highlight
aspects thereof which I thought would be of  importance  for  the  House  to
note - and I am convinced that the Minister must have a spy  in  my  office,
because it so happens that every time when we speak here  our  speeches  are
almost identical! I am convinced that  the  Ministry  must  be  getting  the
information from somewhere! [Interjections.]

On the  Occupational  Diseases  in  Mines  and  Works  Amendment  Bill,  the
Minister has covered all the areas I wanted to cover in my speech  and  that
will be captured in Hansard, so I will not dwell on those.  May  I  then  be
allowed to talk about the Medicines and Related Substances Amendment Bill.

To begin with, I would like to highlight some of  the  principal  tenets  of
our national draft  policy,  which  is  of  particular  importance  to  this
amending Bill.  Firstly,  the  establishment  of  the  registration  process
ensures the safety, high quality and efficacy of our  drugs.  Secondly,  the
prescription of medicines by their generic names  in  both  the  public  and
private sector or in our institutions is encouraged.

The  first  amendment  of  the  Bill  relates  to  the  insertion   of   two
definitions, ie the definitions of  magistrate  and  practitioner.  This  is
basically done  to  bring  them  in  line  with  some  of  our  more  recent
legislation,  therefore  I  will  not  dwell  on  those.  Amongst  the  more
substantive  amendments  is  the  following:  Firstly,  the   marketing   of
medicines. The Minister also alluded to that area. This  amendment  provides
for the Minister to  make  regulations  to  provide  for  the  marketing  of
medicines and an enforceable code of practice relating  to  this.  This,  of
course, will be done after  consultation  with  the  relevent  stakeholders,
including our big friends, the pharmaceuticals.

This will prevent a situation where all and sundry jump onto  the  marketing
bandwagon and market all manner  of  medicines  to  unsuspecting  consumers,
therefore  rendering  them  vulnerable  to  harmful  substances.  The   next
amendment that I think is of importance is that of section 14 of Act  90  of
1997, where an obligation is  placed  on  the  pharmacist  or  the  licensed
dispensing person to advise or  to  take  reasonable  steps  to  inform  the
patient of the benefits of generic substitutions of this medication.

It is known that generic medication is usually  much  more  affordable  than
the branded medication. Therefore, doctors would  prefer  to  prescribe  the
latter for obvious reasons, ie the profit  they  can  make  by  doing  this,
especially to patients who have access to medical aid and  are  ignorant  of
the benefits, both health and financewise, of these alternatives.

I must also say that this places a responsibility on  Government  to  ensure
the registration of good quality generics, if available, and to  liaise  and
engage the Department of Trade and Industry,  the  SA  Revenue  Service  and
other relevant stakeholders to expedite the importation of these generics.

Secondly, I wish to talk about the establishment of the  pricing  committee,
which the Minister alluded to. I find this amendment in particular to be  of
huge significance, especially  when  we  talk  about  the  affordability  of
medicines. In many instances pharmacists and other  dispensing  persons  buy
medicines at great discount  from  distributors  and  wholesalers,  but  for
purposes of profitmaking do not pass these discounts on to  their  consumers
or patients.

The mandate of the pricing committee would therefore  be  to  determine  the
price charged for all medicines dispensed by pharmacist or persons  licensed
to dispense. Of course, these prices will be determined  after  consultation
and negotiation with the dispenser, as the Minister said.  We  believe  that
this amendment lends substance to  the  Government's  commitment  to  access
affordable  health  care  and  cost-containment  to  ensure   overall   cost
effectiveness. Clauses 9, 11 and 13 are basically technical  amendments,  so
I would therefore also not dwell on them.

As for the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill, the first  amendment  deals  with
the redefinition of a broker which is consistent with the  policy  framework
or the financial, advisory and  intermediatory  services.  It  also  clearly
spells out which services the broker can and cannot provide.  The  insertion
of a new definition  of  broker  services,  which  allows  for  an  expanded
definition of the term,  will  now  enable  health  brokers  to  provide  an
ongoing  service  and  advice  to  members  on  the  most  appropriate   and
affordable services available to them. This extends their  previous  mandate
beyond just introducing members to medical schemes. This, we  believe,  will
protect users against  unscrupulous  and  exploitative  medical  aid  scheme
brokers or so-called service providers.

In conclusion, I would like to thank the  Minister,  Dr  Tshabalala-Msimang;
her department, under the very able leadership of Dr Ntsaluba, the Director-
General and his officials - some of whom  are  present  here  with  us;  the
state law advisers for their assistance to the select  committee  -  and,  I
must say, under a very tight schedule; Johannes, the  parliamentary  liaison
officer, whom I saw earlier on; and last, but not least, the members of  the
select committee, who diligently participated in  the  processing  of  these
Bills.

The committee, therefore,  places  before  the  Council  the  Medicines  and
Related Substances Amendment Bill, the Occupational Diseases  in  Mines  and
Works Amendment Bill, and the Medical Schemes  Amendment  Bill,  the  latter
with the additional amendments from  the  select  committee  which  will  be
referred to the portfolio committee for concurrence.

I place these Bills before the Council for adoption. [Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon colleagues, the  Medicines  and
Related Substances Control Act, Act 90 of 1997 was the subject  of  a  court
action by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers  Association.  The  PMA  withdrew
its challenge in April 2001, after consultation with leading  world  figures
like Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan. This was a conciliatory gesture  on  the
part of the PMA in the interests of health care in South Africa.

Die wetsontwerp wat ons vandag voor ons het, is egter voorskriftelik en  gee
oormatige mag aan die Minister. Baie van die  partye  wat  voorleggings  aan
die portefeuljekomitee gemaak het, was  bekommerd  oor  die  onafhanklikheid
van die MCC, die Medicines  Control  Council.  Daar  word  byvoorbeeld  geen
voorsiening gemaak vir nominasies vanuit die openbare sektor  nie.  Die  MCC
is veronderstel om 'n spesialiskomitee te wees en dus  sou  'n  mens  verwag
dat  daar  'n  spesifieke  getal  lede  sou  wees  met   spesifieke   kennis
verteenwoordigend van sekere sektore. 'n Mens sou dus ook  verwag  dat  daar
lede in die raad sou dien met kennis  van  die  vervaardigingindustrie.  Die
wet spesifiseer egter dat sodanige persone nie in die  raad  mag  dien  nie.
Dit is dus duidelik dat politieke oorwegings swaarder weeg  as  die  belange
van die mense.

Klousule  8  maak  voorsiening  vir  die   instelling   van   'n   ''pricing
committee''. Dié komitee besluit oor sy eie reëls en regulasies en ons  sien
dit  as  ondemokraties.  Die  hoofdoel  van  die  ``pricing  committee''  is
pryskontrole en dit druis in teen die Regering se beleid van vrye handel.

Om te appelleer teen die Medicines Control Council se besluite blyk vir  ons
problematies te wees.

Die Minister  van  Gesondheid  en  die  Direkteur-Generaal  blyk  beide  die
implementeerders van die wetgewing te wees,  asook  om  in  beheer  van  die
appèlle daarteen te wees.

Die DP kan dus nie hierdie wetgewing steun nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The Bill before us today is indeed prescriptive and gives excess  power  to
the Minister. Many of the parties who  made  submissions  to  the  portfolio
committee were worried about the independence of the MCC, ie  the  Medicines
Control Council. No provision  is  made  for  nominations  from  the  public
sector. The MCC is supposed to be a committee of specialists and  one  would
expect that it would  have  a  specific  number  of  members  with  specific
knowledge and representative of certain sectors. One would also expect  that
members would serve on the council with knowledge  about  the  manufacturing
industry. The Act specifies that such persons may not serve on the  council.
It is evident that political considerations play a far more  important  role
than the needs of the people.

Clause 8 provides for the inception of a pricing committee.  This  committee
decides on its own rules and regulations and we regard it  as  undemocratic.
The main purpose of the pricing committee  is  price  control  and  it  goes
against Government's policy on free trade.

To appeal against the decisions of the Medicines Control  Council  seems  to
us to be problematic. The Minister of Health and the  Director-General  both
seem to be the implementators of this legislation, and are  also  in  charge
of appeals against it.

The DP cannot support this legislation.]

With regard  to  the  Medical  Schemes  Amendment  Bill,  7  million  people
subscribe to  private  medical  schemes  in  South  Africa.  It  is  a  very
competitive  industry  and  the  consumer  is  often  the  loser  owing   to
manipulation by brokers and their agents.

The object of this amending Bill is to broaden and  tighten  the  definition
of a broker, to ensure  proper  accreditation  and  to  determine  desirable
business practice and good conduct.

The proposed amendments will improve governance  and  oversight  of  medical
schemes;  secondly,  protect  schemes   against   fraud;   thirdly,   reduce
opportunistic behaviour by consumers;  fourthly,  offer  protection  to  the
consumer against unlawful and abusive conduct, both by medical  schemes  and
unscrupulous brokers;  and,  fifthly,  create  greater  financial  stability
within the private health care sector.

The DP supports this amending Bill.

With regard to the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Amendment  Bill,
the mining industry is an important pillar of  the  South  African  economy.
The industry is a major  employer.  In  2000  it  employed  nearly  400  000
workers. The fear of  injury  and  sudden  death  when  working  underground
remains the most feared consequence for the workers.  The  reality  is  that
the annual certification for pneumoconiosis plus new cases of TB  in  miners
exceed the annual number of injuries reported.

Silica inhalation and silicosis greatly increase the risk of TB  in  miners.
Lung disease and hearing loss are two main mining-  related  diseases  which
are capable of killing them.  Many  ex-miners  suffer  from  pneumoconiosis,
which is the deposit of dust in the lungs and the lungs' reaction to it.

The amendment Bill will enhance the quality of life of  miners  who  may  be
ill as a direct result of an occupational disease.  It  also  addresses  the
responsibility of the mining industry towards  its  workers  in  respect  of
occupational diseases.

The DP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

[I want to allay the fears of those who are fearful of  changes,  by  saying
that their safety under the leadership of the ANC-led Government  under  the
leadership of  President  Mbeki  is  certain,  because  this  Government  is
safeguarding the interests of all the  people.  This  Bill  is  evidence  of
this.]

The Medical Scheme Amendment Bill before us must be seen in the  context  of
all that has gone before, to ensure  that  poor  transparency  and  lack  of
oversight over the medical scheme industry is firmly relegated to the  past.
Before the previous Act was legislated, members of medical  schemes  had  to
bear the unreasonably high cost of services that  was  being  flouted  under
the guise of administration and commission costs.

The activities of primary and subsidiary  stakeholders  within  the  medical
scheme industry were often suspect and sometimes even illegal. In the  past,
everyone would get onto the bandwagon to milk  the  consumer,  resulting  in
convenient  arrangements  and   payoffs   among   and   between   companies,
administrators, brokers and almost  everyone  who  sought  to  gain  from  a
medical scheme client.  Discriminatory  treatment  against  the  chronically
ill, the elderly, the poor and those responsible for extended  families  was
the order of the day. At the end of the day the Act stepped very  firmly  on
sensitive toes in the industry in an effort to ensure  the  accountable  and
transparent industry of today.

The current amending Bill before us ties up some  loose  ends  in  governing
the behaviour of brokers in the industry. There  were  some  delays  in  the
processing of the  Medical  Schemes  Amendment  Bill  due  to  the  imminent
passage of the Financial Advisory  and  Intermediatory  Services  Bill.  The
problem centred mainly  on  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Council  of  Medical
Schemes to give accreditation to health brokers. The  contention  by  virtue
of the FAIS Bill gives this right to the Financial Services Board where  the
Medical Schemes Amendment Bill gives same right to the  Council  of  Medical
Schemes.

This amendment as it currently stands, makes provision  for  the  Department
of Finance, through the FSB, to ensure that accreditation is  given  to  all
financial  advisors,  including  health  brokers,  thereby   ensuring   that
uniformity and minimum standards are  maintained  across  all  sectors  that
utilise the services of brokers. Similarly, the Department  of  Health  will
exercise  its  responsibility  through  ensuring  that   policy   objectives
contained in the Medical Schemes Act - governing areas  such  as  stability,
nondiscriminatory access, distribution of  risks  and  other  activities  of
health brokers - are closely monitored.

The Department of Health is  placed  in  an  ideal  position  where  it  can
protect the users of medical schemes from unscrupulous health  brokers.  The
new amendment that is before the NCOP now has a clearer  and  more  expanded
definition for  the  terms  ``broker''  and  ``broker  services.''  The  new
definition for broker allows for the health broker  to  be  consistent  with
the policy framework stipulated in the FAIS  Bill.  The  provisions  of  the
FAIS Bill, as well as the  expanded  definition  of  broker  services,  will
enable health brokers  to  provide  ongoing  services  and  give  advice  to
members of medical schemes. This extends  its  current  framework  in  which
health brokers essentially introduce members to medical schemes.

Provision has been made for conditions of  accreditation,  and  the  CMS  is
currently working with the  department  and  the  industry  to  improve  the
existing formulation. The accreditation process has been ongoing  since  the
year 2000. According to the Health department, this has meant  that,  almost
all  the  health  brokers  who  applied  for  this   had   either   received
accreditation or had been rejected. The amendment provides  for  consistency
between  the  CMS  accreditation  process   and   a   regulatory   standards
established underphase.

I believe one of the most significant changes brought about by the  amending
Bill is the prohibition placed on the  brokers,  whereby  they  may  not  be
directly or indirectly compensated for  providing  broker  services  by  any
person other than a medical scheme; a member or prospective member,  or  the
employer of such member or  prospective  member  in  respect  of  whom  such
broker services are provided;  or  a  broker  employing  such  broker.  This
clarity goes a long way to stamp out the current  corrupt  practices  within
the industry, where brokers are compensated every time they bring ...  [Time
expired.]

Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, hon Minister and members,  the  three  amendment
Bills  have  received  full  support  from  the  UDM.  In  our  view,  these
amendments are necessary in order to address  specific  situations  relating
to the principal Acts. Clause 1 of the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill  deals
with the definition of a broker. In this regard a proposal went through  the
Portfolio Committee on Health to extend the definition  to  include  persons
who are otherwise excluded from such definitions if such persons  choose  to
be accredited as brokers, or who actively market or canvass  for  membership
of medical schemes.

The importance of the amendment in clause 2 is  that  it  provides  for  the
accreditation of a broker by  the  Council  for  Medical  Schemes  upon  the
payment of a prescribed fee, and that  no  broker  may  be  compensated  for
services rendered before such accreditation has taken place.

There is also merit in clause 2 of  the  Medicines  and  Related  Substances
Amendment Bill. It grants the Minister the right  to  appoint  a  person  to
fill a vacancy in the Council  for  this  period.  The  appointment  of  the
Registrar and the Deputy Registrar by the Minister after consultation,  with
the Council is also commendable. I underline the word  consultation  because
it is an indication that the Minister will be taking  an  informed  decision
when she makes the appointment. The functions of the  Registrar  and  Deputy
Registrar are also outlined in Clause 3 of the Bill.

The appointment of the pricing committee  is  another  important  aspect  of
this Bill. We were informed by the department during the briefing  that  the
pricing  committee  does  not  set  prices,  but  rather  interrogates   the
manufacturers'  prices.  Also,  the  importance  of  the   provision   which
prohibits the selling  of  medicines  at  a  price  higher  than  the  price
contemplated  in  terms  of  another  provision  in  this  Act   cannot   be
overemphasised. Therefore, it is my belief that a measure of  price  control
on medicines is effected.

Appeal procedures against the decisions of the  council  and  the  Director-
General are also clearly understood and accepted.  The  appointment  of  the
chairperson contemplated in 9(C) of the Bill on the basis  of  knowledge  of
the law is fully supported, although it is our view that experience -  which
the same paragraphs serves to delete - should also  be  taken  into  account
when appointments are made.
Regarding the Occupational Diseases  in  Mines  and  Works  Amendment  Bill,
clause 1 amends the principal Act by extending the period within  which  the
Director-General may refuse an application for the medical examination of  a
person  suffering  from  any  of  the   occupational   diseases   that   are
compensatable in terms of the Act from 6 to 24 months, as the  Minister  has
already indicated. [Time expired.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, I might not finish my  speech  as  it  is  eight
pages long. I will just try to summarise it. We know that South Africa,  for
whatever reason, is increasingly being regarded as a haven of would-be  drug
dealers from across the globe. I just want us to remind  ourselves  of  this
fact. With an acute awareness of  this  dilemma,  the  SAPS,  Department  of
Safety  and  Security,  SA  National  Defence  Force  and   other   agencies
responsible for the safety of our citizens have over  the  past  few  months
and years found huge caches of illegal drugs at our  airports  and  habours,
all destined for the very lucrative global drug-trafficking market.

Some of these drugs are mandrax tablets, crack cocaine  and  dagga,  all  of
them banned substances.  These  are  easily  detectable  by  monitoring  the
influx of huge consignments at our ports of entry. However, there are  other
legal drugs that are not easy to detect which are  finding  their  way  into
our  shores  through  syndicates  with  expertise  in   the   manufacturing,
marketing and distribution of these drugs.

All the sectors involved in the combating of illegal drugs into our  country
have found that there has been a significant loophole in the  South  African
legislation  which  inhibits  the  stricter  control  of  these   contraband
medicines. One of those loopholes has been the control  mechanism  governing
the importation and exportation of legal medicine in  the  normal  cause  of
the purchasing and selling of medicine, such  as  cycoclopic  and  narcotics
both within and outside of our borders.  We  have  found  ourselves  running
into control problems.

To help alleviate this  problem,  the  amendment  to  section  22(a)  is  an
attempt to ensure that the sale of certain Schedules 5 and 6  substances  in
the pharmaceutical industry is recorded in a register of sold  products.  In
addition, to provide for  proper  checks  and  balances,  they  should  also
reconcile what they have sold with what is left in stock four times a  year,
ie at the end of March, June, September and December.
All of these balances must be completed within 14 days. After the due  date,
these stricter measures will hopefully make everyone aware  of  the  problem
and thus more accountable for both the large-scale  theft  of  drugs  within
the legitimate industry and the  prohibition  of  the  drug  smugglers  from
carrying out their operations.

Section 22(a) has also  been  substantially  strengthened  by  making  it  a
prerequisite that a Schedule  8  substance  only  be  acquired  through  the
Director-General for  the  purpose  of  providing  these  drugs  to  medical
practitioners  only.  Even  then,   the   patient,   through   the   medical
practitioner, must have the prescribed condition  requiring  the  treatment.
Thereafter, both the council and the Director-General need  to  approve  the
treatment.

Similarly, this amending Bill has included drugs contained in  Schedules  5,
6, 7 and 8 for tighter control, in an effort to combat the drug  trafficking
trade and to meet the international guidelines governing the exportation  of
certain drugs.  Some  of  these  drugs  have  very  lucrative  international
markets and without the necessary control mechanisms in place,  we  will  be
unable to stem the tide of the illegal drug trade.
The other immense challenge that this amending Bill tackles head-on  is  the
problem of the pricing of drugs. We will  all  remember  vividly  our  fight
with large pharmaceutical companies on the issue  of  parallel  importation.
We won that battle and generic substitution is  part  of  our  daily  lives.
However, the lack of control with regard to appropriate  pricing  mechanisms
is threatening to undermine our purpose of  providing  affordable  medicines
to the poor. There has been a substantial public outcry  regarding  the  way
the industry is manipulating the cost of medicines within itself.

In conclusion, when the Bill is implemented,  it  is  envisaged  that  there
will be greater interaction between the  industry's  pricing  mechanism  and
the pricing committee established by  this  Bill.  The  pricing  committee's
role  is  to  be  proactive  and  practical,  especially   when   it   makes
recommendations to the Minister on the  issue  of  escalating  drug  prices.
This role will become increasingly important if drug prices in South  Africa
are found to be inappropriately high vis-á-vis prices  elsewhere  in  Africa
or internationally. As an example, this pricing committee will be  empowered
to recommend parallel importation.

For all these, including other  pieces  of  legislation,  the  ANC  supports
these Bills.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  member,  you  have  done
well. You were able to finish within your allocated time.

Dr P J C NEL: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister, dit is vir my 'n voorreg  om
aan hierdie debat deel te neem. Dat ons vandag drie gesondheidswette in  een
sitting hanteer, weerspieël die  belangrike  rol  wat  die  Departement  van
Gesondheid in die wel en weë van die gemeenskap speel. Dit is dan  ook  geen
wonder  dat  die  agb  President  dit  goed  gedink  het  om  'n   bykomende
adjunkministerpos vir Gesondheid te skep nie. Ek wil hom gelukwens  daarmee,
asook met sy keuse van die persoon wat hy in die pos aangestel het.  Ek  wil
dan ook die agb lid Schoeman baie geluk wens met die aanstelling.

Hierdie wetsontwerpe het dit basies ten doel om die belange van die  publiek
wat gesondheidsdienste benodig, te beskerm en daarom steun die  Nuwe  NP  al
drie hierdie wetsontwerpe.

Die Wetsontwerp op Mediese Skemas  poog  om  die  lede  van  die  skemas  te
beskerm teen die voortdurende styging in die  finansiële  bydraes  van  lede
tot die mediese skema.  Die  bekamping  van  onbeheersde  uitgawes  op  nie-
mediese koste kan die styging in mediese inflasie ook bekamp. As 'n mens  in
ag neem dat die bedrag wat spandeer is aan  makelaarskommissie  alleen  R290
miljoen beloop het in die jaar 2001, dan besef mens 'n  dat  'n  gedragskode
en 'n duidelike omskrywing van die funksies van makelaars waarvoor  die  wet
voorsiening maak, baie noodsaaklik is. (Translation of Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, it is a  privilege  for  me  to
participate in this debate. The fact that we are dealing with  three  health
Acts in one sitting reflects the important  role  which  the  Department  of
Health plays in the wellbeing of the community. It is then  no  wonder  that
the hon President thought it a  good  idea  to  have  an  additional  deputy
minister's post created for health. I would  like  to  congratulate  him  on
that, as well as with his choice of person that he appointed in the post.  I
would then also  like  to  congratulate  the  hon  member  Schoeman  on  his
appointment.

These Bills basically have as their aim the protection of the  interests  of
the public who needs health  services,  and  for  that  reason  the  New  NP
supports all three these Bills.

The Medical Schemes Amendment Bill aims to  protect  the  members  of  these
schemes against the  continuing  rise  in  the  financial  contributions  of
members to these medical schemes. The combating of uncontrolled expenses  of
non-medical costs can also fight the increase in medical inflation.  If  one
takes into account  that  the  amount  spent  on  brokers  commission  alone
amounted to R290 million in the year 2001, then one realises that a code  of
conduct and a clear definition of the functions of brokers,  for  which  the
Act makes provision, are essential.]

I would  now  like  to  deal  with  the  Medicines  and  Related  Substances
Amendment Bill, which is a very serious business and has been for  the  past
five years.  The  principal  Medicines  Act  of  1965  was  amended  by  the
promulgation of the Medicines and Related Substances Act, Act  90  of  1997.
This Act has, however, never been  implemented,  as  the  hon  Minister  has
already told us, due to the fact that the SA Medicine and  Medical  Services
Regulatory Act, the so-called Samdra Act, which was supposed to replace  Act
90 of 1997, had to be withdrawn  because  it  was  procedurally  incorrectly
promulgated.

The legislation in front of us attempts to address  some  of  these  issues.
The dispensing of medicine  by  medical  doctors  has  always  been  a  very
sensitive issue, as medical doctors regard it as  their  undefeatable  right
to dispense medicine. Unfortunately, in a few instances dispensing became  a
major  part  of  their  practices  and  has  also   given   rise   to   many
irregularities.

The New NP therefore supports the concept of a licence to dispense, but  has
some reservations about the prescribed way in which such licence  should  be
obtained. The amendment to section 22(C)(2) states that a licence shall  not
be  issued  unless  the  applicant  has  successfully  completed  a   course
determined by the SA Pharmacy Council, after consultation with the  relevant
professional board.

We are not in favour of a course being determined by  the  council,  because
it would mean that two  different  professional  boards  will  regulate  one
profession. Surely that  would  jeopardise  interprofessional  relationships
that are so necessary in the health family. The New  NP  proposes  that  the
relevant professional boards determine their own respective  courses,  after
consultation with the SA Pharmacy Council.

Die Wysigingswetsontwerp op Bedryfsiektes in Myne  en  Werksplekke  poog  om
die werker te beskerm en wat daar omtrent hierdie wet te sê is,  is  alreeds
gesê. Ek wil dit nie herhaal  nie,  maar  ek  wil  net  graag  noem  dat  ek
verskriklik dankbaar is dat hierdie wetsontwerp die  situasie  verhoed  waar
dit baie kere gebeur het dat 'n sogenaamde agent of raadgewer wat die  eiser
help, met die grootste deel van die vergoeding wegkom.

As 'n mens in ag neem aan watter  gevaarlike  omgewing  die  mynwerker  elke
werksdag van sy lewe blootgestel word,  dan  is  dit  'n  skande  dat  hulle
uitgebuit word deur gewetenlose mense. Die mynwerker verdien elke  sent  van
die  vergoeding  wat  hom  toekom.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[The Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Amendment Act aims to  protect
the worker and what was to be said about this Act has already been  said.  I
do not want to repeat it, but I  would  only  like  to  mention  that  I  am
terribly grateful that this Bill remedies the situation where in many  cases
a so-called agent or advisor who helps the claimant,  walks  away  with  the
biggest portion of the compensation.

If one takes into  account  the  dangerous  environment  the  mineworker  is
exposed to every working day of his life, then it is a shame that  they  are
exploited by unscrupulous people. The mineworker deserves every cent of  the
compensation which he rightfully deserves.]]

Despite some reservations in the second Bill,  we  support  all  the  Bills.
[Applause.]

(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, the hon the  Minister  and  his  department,
the august National Council of Provinces, today three laws  which  are  very
crucial to our lives are being reviewed.

I will be brief and I will just touch on each of those laws that  are  being
reviewed. The amendment of section 32 in the amendment Act of 2002  will  be
achieved if it is kept in mind that indigenous medicines  are  also  useful.
People would not be using them so extensively if they were not effective  at
all.

We would like to commend the contribution of the Department  of  Health  for
showing  respect  for  natural  healing  medicines.  More  research   should
continue in this field  in  order  to  uplift  the  standard  of  indigenous
healers regarding  health-related  matters.  There  should  be  healthy  co-
operation and looking down upon others should come  to  an  end,  especially
regarding the indigenous  medicines  which  have  been  in  use  since  time
immemorial. The department is taking a significant step forward. We  of  the
IFP support this Bill since we have many indigenous healers  and  herbalists
in KwaZulu-Natal.]

The IFP supports the amending  Bill,  as  it  deals  mainly  with  technical
issues. We support any effort to  improve  scheduling  and  control  of  the
import and export of medicine, as well as to amend the powers to search  and
seize in order to make them constitutional.

Okulandelayo ngizothi fahla fahla ngezifo esizithola lapha emsebenzini.

Lokhu kuchibiyela sengathi kuzocacisa okuningi  okuyizinkinga  uma  umqashwa
esegula, ikakhulu uma umsebenzi awenzayo kuyiwona oyimbangela yokugula.

Zolo  lokhu  bekunodaba   olusematheni   futhi   luyinzukayikeyi   kubaqashi
abakhiqiza  i-asbhestosi.  Abantu  bagula,   iningi   labo   lashona   futhi
abangaluthola usizo  olufanele.  Kukhona  abanye  abaphathwa  isifo  sofuba,
amazwibela awo umsebenzi njalo. Abanye bakhubazeka ingqondo,  umuntu  agcine
esenesithuthwane ayengene emsebenzini ephila saka.

Ukuvimbela  ukuxhashazwa  komqashwa  ngumqashi,   lo   mThetho   sichibiyelo
uyayibeka  imininingwane   okudingeka   ibe   yisisekelo   sokuthi   umqashi
angabalekeli   izindleko   uma   umqashwa   esegula.   Lokhu   kungukuvikela
inkombankombane, omunye nomunye evikela iso lakhe.

Lo mThetho sichibiyelo uphinde uzibale  nezifo  ezivamise  ukugulisa  abantu
emsebenzini abawenzayo. Sicela abaqashi ukuba benze indawo  yomkhiqizo  wabo
ibe indawo ephephile. Abaqashwa  mabanikezwe  izivikelo  ezilusizo  ekulweni
nezifo,  kube  khona  abezempilo  abanakekela   izisebenzi   zabo.   Kukhona
engithanda ukukubeka  ophikweni  lenhlangano  yosizo  lwezokwelashwa.  Imali
abayithathayo inkulu kakhulu. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[I will now briefly move to the diseases that are acquired at work.
It looks as if this amendment will clarify many  problematic  aspects  which
are encountered when an employee gets sick, especially if that  sickness  is
directly linked to the type of work  which  that  employee  does.  Recently,
current  affairs  carried  reports  of  the  conundrum  that  was  faced  by
employers in the asbestos industry. People were  sick.  Most  of  them  died
without getting appropriate help. Some developed TB as a result of the  work
that they did. Others were mentally disabled  and  ended  up  with  epilepsy
while they had started working absolutely healthy.

In order to prevent the exploitation of an employee  by  an  employer,  this
amending Bill lays down the details  which  will  form  the  foundation  for
preventing employers from avoiding paying costs when an  employee  is  taken
sick. That is intended to avoid an abdication of responsibility,  with  each
party pointing a finger at the other.

This amending Bill also specifies  those  diseases  with  which  people  are
usually infected in their places  of  work.  We  would  like  to  appeal  to
employers to ensure that the places where production takes place  are  safe.
Employees must have access to protection  measures  that  are  effective  in
combating diseases. There should be health workers whose task it is to  look
after workers. I would also like to make a  comment  regarding  medical  aid
schemes. They deduct hefty amounts of money.]

The deductions are high when compared to the benefits that the  member  gets
when claiming. The allocation of benefits are so high  for  rare  conditions
that the company benefits more at the expense  of  the  contributors.  [Time
expired.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson and hon members of the House, I  also  want  to
take this opportunity to congratulate our beloved Comrade  Moosa  on  moving
on to greener pastures. [Laughter.] I have known  Mr  Moosa  to  be  a  very
capable man, especially during the  time  when  we  were  dealing  with  the
Equality Bill. I saw that he could withstand the storms that were  there  at
that time. I congratulate him and wish him well in his new venture.

Except for the Medicines and Related Substances Amendment  Bill,  the  Bills
under discussion are so short that it is practically  impossible  to  debate
them without repeating what the previous speakers  have  said.  So,  due  to
time limitations, I do not intend to dwell on the details, but to browse  on
the peripheral aspects of the Bill.
For purposes of my contribution, it is sufficient to  mention  that  in  the
Medical Schemes Amendment Bill, one of the main purposes  of  the  amendment
is to broaden the definition of ``broker'' in order to include  the  ongoing
provision of advice, services  and  the  admission  of  members  to  medical
schemes. In the Occupational Diseases in Mines  and  Works  Amendment  Bill,
the amendment seeks to extend the period within  which  the  director  could
refuse an application for medical examination ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member,  your  time  has  expired!
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Order! Yes, hon member, are you rising on a point of order?

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, I do not think this  is  fair,  because  the  hon
member was still ``browsing on the peripheral aspects!'' [Laughter.]

Mr B J TOLO: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, special delegates,  hon  members,
you will forgive me for some repetitions. [Laughter.] I  rise  to  speak  on
the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Amendment Bill.

Mining has always been and  remains  a  cornerstone  of  the  South  African
economy. It has over the years directly  and  indirectly  contributed  about
43,1% of our GDP. It remains an important foreign exchange  earner  for  our
country to this day, but it is also worth mentioning that the  profitability
of the mining industry, especially before 1994, was mainly due to  the  fact
that the national oppression of black people aided, to a large  extent,  the
super exploitation of the workers. It means that there was  a  very  healthy
relationship between class exploitation and national oppression.

For the mine owners, healthy working conditions was a  foreign  concept,  as
their interest was profit, and profit  alone.  For  many  years  mineworkers
have had to bear the enormous burden of  unbearable  working  conditions  in
the mines. Diseases emanating from these mines were the order  of  the  day.
Occurrences  of  occupational  diseases  were  the  rule,  rather  than  the
exception to the rule. Miners themselves would often be  unaware  that  they
were operating in a hazardous environment,  until  they  developed  symptoms
associated with the contamination that they were exposed to.

The  mineworker,  who  is  invariably  black,  having  worked  under   those
conditions for many years, becomes weak,  sick  and  even  aged  before  his
time. The mine owners, realising that they  can  no  longer  squeeze  labour
power out of these workers, would then  bundle  them  into  buses  and  drop
them, like squeezed oranges in the former homelands - the labour reserves  -
and even in the neighbouring countries. Those buses  would  then  return  to
the mines with other young and strong men to restart the cycle.

Sophia Kisting corroborates the above in an article she wrote  entitled  The
Asbestos Legacy: A Collective  Response,  in  which  she  actually  outlines
steps that should be taken in South  Africa  to  address  the  problem.  She
says, among other things, and I quote:


  Poor working conditions on asbestos mines resulted in extensive exposure.
  Communities living near the mines were also exposed.

She goes on to say, and I quote:


  The majority of the ex-mineworkers are now unemployed  and  dependent  on
  the public health service for their health care. The mining companies, by
  and large, did not make provision for the follow-up care of  workers  who
  developed asbestosis and related diseases years after they had  left  the
  mines.

This Council is aware of the many sad stories that we can  tell  about  what
is happening in this country in relation to this matter  of  asbestosis  and
other toxic substances found in the mines. The  story  that  comes  to  mind
here is that of Libode in the Transkei, where 37% of the former  mineworkers
were found to be suffering from  pneumoconiosis  -  this  is  a  jawbreaker,
members will forgive me for that - and 65% of these people did  not  receive
any compensation.

There is also the story in Lesotho, where about 800 retrenched  miners  were
actually medically examined and it was found that 40% of them suffered  from
the very same disease, and not one of them is  receiving  any  compensation.
We can go on and on - the bottom line  is  that  asbestos  and  other  toxic
substances in the mines cause irreparable damage to our people.

The development of strong trade  unions  in  the  mines,  coupled  with  the
advent of democracy in our country, mitigated the working conditions in  the
mines today. To a large extent, it is no longer a matter of profit,  but  of
``health comes first''.

The Bill before us today further betters the lives of  mineworkers  and  ex-
mineworkers. Clause 1 of the principal Act, among other  things,  says  that
any person who works or has worked in the mines  may  apply  for  a  medical
examination to the director to determine whether  he  or  she  suffers  from
compensatable diseases. It further indicates that the  director  may  refuse
if that person has been examined within a period  of  six  months  preceding
the date of the application. This suggests that  examinations  can  be  done
every half-yearly.

This Bill changes this to six years, as stated earlier on. This  is  due  to
the fact that there was some realisation that these  diseases  take  a  long
time to progress and that the very x-rays themselves, if one is  exposed  to
them for a long time, can become harmful, as the Minister indicated.

The original provision  of  clause  2  was  that  a  person  affected  by  a
compensatable disease must only be compensated for  a  period  of  not  more
than two years after contracting the  disease.  This  clause  suggests  that
compensation will be for a maximum of two  years  and  that  beyond  that  a
person will receive no compensation. This, we think, was unfair.  This  Bill
changes that, and this becomes open-ended. Once a person  has  contracted  a
disease, he or she will be compensated as long as the  cause,  as  indicated
earlier on, is legitimate and proven.

Many people working in the mines are either illiterate  or  semi-literate  -
of course, this is not their fault. From time to time ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member! [Laughter.]

Mr B J TOLO: The ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, I am sure you will agree with  me  that
the previous speaker ended on a very sound note. It is not their fault.

I think that all that needed to be said has  been  said.  I  would  like  to
thank very much all members who participated in  the  debate  on  the  three
amendment Bills. These amendments will assist us to ensure,  as  I  said  at
the  beginning,  access  to  affordable,  safe,  efficacious   and   quality
medicines in our country. I would  like  to  thank  the  members  again  for
supporting the amendments.

I would just like to address myself seriously to  Mrs  Gouws,  and  I  think
that is the only comment that I will  make.  Firstly,  frankly  speaking,  I
think that it was a shame that the member was held at  ransom  in  terms  of
the Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Act, Act 90 of  1997.
I think that it is a shame. Therefore, I am really  surprised  by  what  Mrs
Gouws said. Of course, I honestly believe that what she  said  is  not  what
she believes as an individual. I really do not think that that is  what  she
believes, because how could she come here to Parliament and say that she  is
an elected  representative  of  the  people,  that  she  will  defend  their
interests, ensure that we provide them will quality  health  care  and  then
stand up here and oppose this very  important  Bill?  [Interjections.]  Yes,
the hon member did that.

I am convinced that that is not what she believes as  an  individual.  I  am
sure of that since I have interacted with her, gone with her to the  Eastern
Cape and she told me how much she  was  concerned  about  ensuring  that  we
provide quality health care. I would really be surprised  if  that  is  what
she believes in. I am convinced that she does not believe in  what  she  has
just said. [Interjections.] There is now a possibility for her  to  identify
with those who are really interested in the  quality  of  the  life  of  our
people, and that is to cross the floor. [Interjections.] She  will  then  be
in an environment where she can actually speak  freely  in  defence  of  the
people of this country. [Interjections.]

However, let me just also remind Mrs Gouws that the withdrawal of  the  case
was not really out of the goodness of the hearts of PMA.  She  knows  pretty
well that the international pressure was mounting against PMA. So, they  did
not do that because they had suddenly thought: Oh, well, we need to be  nice
to these South Africans. There was pressure on  them.  The  hon  member  may
probably not know that there was quite an amount of negotiations  that  went
on behind closed doors between ourselves and PMA.

Really, it was not because PMA wanted to demonstrate  that  they  were  very
reconciliatory. It was not that. There were serious  debates  behind  closed
doors until we reached a situation where they, indeed, said that that  could
not continue because they recognised that they were wrong. We then set up  a
seven-a-side committee and we have been working. So, I do not know  who  the
hon member is defending. She cannot defend them, because she does  not  know
what was happened between us and pharmaceutical companies. In fact,  we  had
a series of meetings with the pharmaceutical companies. As  the  hon  member
knows, we have said that we have been developing regulations with them.  So,
I do not know who is she defending. Mrs Gouws just does not a have a leg  to
stand on in the defence of the pharmaceutical companies. They  know  exactly
that what they were doing was immoral and wrong. [Interjections.]

It is probably important for me to say that we have now almost concluded  to
develop the regulations through the members of this House and their  support
for those amendments,  particularly  regarding  the  Medicines  and  Related
Substances Amendment Bill. I think that what the hon members  are  assisting
us to do now is to get on with our  business,  particularly  to  assist  the
President to promulgate  this  Bill  into  law  so  that  we  can  begin  to
implement it in order to ensure that  we  can  actually  access  affordable,
safe, efficacious and quality medicines in our country.

What surprises me is that it is the  same  DP  that  is  always  complaining
about the fact that they cannot find  medicines  in  our  clinics.  When  we
create a vehicle to ensure that they can access affordable  medicines,  they
are the ones who oppose it. What do  they  actually  want?  [Interjections.]
What are they actually looking for? I really cannot understand  it.  Let  me
just say that as a South African, it really hurts me.  It  really  hurts  me
that when we try to improve the quality of life of our people, there is  one
party that stands against that very noble objective for which  we  are  here
in Cape Town, in Parliament. I think that they really need to rethink  their
stand, honestly. I am saying that very very sincerely.

This will be the last time  this  year  that  I  stand  before  this  august
Council to debate. Very soon we should rise as Parliament and we  should  be
going to our constituencies to do some work.  I  do  wish  all  hon  members
productive work in their constituencies. Soon, thereafter, we shall  all  be
going on holiday. I wish all hon members  a  good  restful  break  and  they
should be ready to start again next  year.  It  will  soon  be  the  festive
season. It is too early to wish the hon members  a  merry  Christmas  and  a
happy new year, but because I will not be seeing the members again, I  might
just as well do it now. I do  wish  the  hon  members  an  exciting  festive
season. However, as we enjoy the festive season, I hope that we will  commit
ourselves in the coming days, starting on 25 November  to  10  December  and
stretching beyond the festive season, and that we will always remember  that
violence destroys our humanity.  Therefore,  I  hope  that  all  of  us  can
participate in these 16 days of activism  on  no  violence  in  our  country
against women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities and  the  men
of our country. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Malibongwe! [Let us praise it!]

HON MEMBERS: Igama lamakhosikazi! [Let us praise the name of the women!]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That concludes  the  debate.  I
shall now put the question in respect of the third Order.  The  question  is
that the Bill,  subject  to  the  proposed  amendments,  be  agreed  to.  In
accordance  with  Rule  63  I  shall  first  allow  political  parties   the
opportunity to make their declarations of vote, if they so  wish.  It  seems
there is none.

We shall now proceed to the voting. Those in favour will say ``Aye''.

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Those  against  will  say  ``No''.  I
think the ayes have it. The majority of members  have  voted  in  favour.  I
therefore declare the Bill, subject to the proposed  amendments,  agreed  to
in terms of section 75 of the Constitution. [Applause.]

I shall now put the question in respect of the fourth  Order.  The  question
is that the Bill be agreed to. In accordance with  Rule  63  I  shall  first
allow political parties the opportunity to make their declarations of  vote,
if their so wish. It seems there is none.

We will now proceed to the voting. Those in favour will say ``Aye''.

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Those against will say  ``No''.  There
is none. I think the ayes have it. The majority of  members  have  voted  in
favour. I therefore declare the Bill agreed to in terms  of  section  75  of
the Constitution. [Applause.]

I shall now put the question in respect of the fifth Order. The question  is
that the Bill be agreed to. In accordance with Rule 63 I shall  first  allow
political parties the opportunity to make their  declarations  of  vote,  if
they so wish. It seems there is none.

We will now proceed to the voting. Those in favour will say ``Aye''.

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Those  against  will  say  ``No''.  I
think the ayes have it. The majority of members  have  voted  in  favour.  I
therefore  declare  the  Bill  agreed  to  in  terms  section  75   of   the
Constitution.

                      MERCHANDISE MARKS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I rise to call on the House to support  quite  an
exciting little law, the Merchandise Marks Amendment Bill. For those who  do
not know what this Bill is about, it tries to outlaw  ``ambush  marketing.''
Now that may sound like a big word, but look  at  the  following  situation:
You are watching rugby, cricket or soccer on TV - Kaizer Chiefs and  Orlando
Pirates are playing - and an SA Breweries or some other advert  is  flighted
just after a player has scored a goal.

All  the  people  who  usually  advertise  there  pay  for  it.  These   are
sponsorships that make events happen. Sometimes one can have an  event  that
is of public interest -  say,  a  very  big  community  event  -  where  big
sponsors put a lot of money into it to make it happen. Sometimes  it  is  an
event that is meaningful to the country, the community and so forth.

However, there are others who do not sponsor. What they  do  is,  they  take
advantage of that publicity without sponsoring the event, ie without  giving
any money. Mr Raju will know  what  I  am  talking  about!  [Interjections.]
Somebody would lift a balloon in a street behind the  stadium  and  all  the
people who have come to the event would see it. They would then  think  that
these people are  also  sponsoring  the  event,  when  in  fact  they  would
actually be doing it from outside the venue and getting lots of TV  and  all
sorts of mileage out of it. The  truth  of  the  matter  is,  they  are  not
sponsoring the event; they are not giving a cent towards the event.

So what this Bill does, is to  try  to  outlaw  those  who  practise  ambush
marketing. Sometimes these people put big advertisements outside  the  gates
of the venue or across the road. One also finds small-scale business  people
who sell T-shirts and those kind of things. Now some of these people  do  in
fact make some contribution in the form of stall rentals, but some  of  them
do not.

What this Bill does, is to allow the Minister to  designate  certain  events
as important events that require protection  in  terms  of  the  Merchandise
Marks Bill. If anybody ambushes such events, they  would  be  committing  an
offence. It is a very interesting little law.
What we have also done through the amendment process is to  make  sure  that
when the Minister designates events, he or she  takes  into  account  proper
participation by black business and small enterprises in the event, so  that
they can also benefit from it without being forced to sell from  across  the
road. In that way we  will  be  making  sure  that  smaller  businesses  and
participants also take advantage of the event.

So that is really what this Bill is about. I want to call on the Council  to
support this Bill.

However, before I sit down, I want to use the balance of my time to  make  a
statement because, as my colleagues know, this is my very last speech  after
nine years in Parliament.

When I was saying a few words earlier on I had forgotten about someone  very
important in the DTI, a person called Mr Johan Strydom. He is not here  now,
but he was earlier. He is a dedicated lawyer who  works  very  hard  on  all
these pieces of legislation; a real  technician  and  committed  person  who
dedicates a lot of time to what he does. I omitted to mention the good  work
he has done for our committee, and I want to apologise to him for  that.  On
behalf of the committee, I want to tell him  that  we  appreciate  the  good
work he has done. I am sure Mr Raju will convey that to him.

In conclusion, I want to say that I have stood up in this House before  many
presiding officers. We started out with the late Mr Kobie Coetzee,  who  was
the President of the Senate at the time. We then  had  Dr  Motsuenyane,  who
was also a very prominent leader of the House at the time and played a  very
big role indeed. We then had Mr Terror Lekota, and then my good  friend  and
colleague, Mr Bulelani Ngcuka. We now have Ms Naledi Pandor.

We also had Mr Mushwana, and we now have Mr Mahlangu. We had great minds  in
this House. We had Prof Mchunu. Ntate Bhengu will remember Prof  Mchunu.  He
was a professor of law, and my very first committee in this  House  was  the
Justice committee. I want to tell Kgoshi Mokoena that I  was  privileged  to
chair that committee. I was privileged to have no less  than  eight  lawyers
in that committee, ie Prof Mchunu, Mr Bulelani Ngcuka, Mr  Enver  Surty,  Mr
Mohamed Bhabha, Mr Radue, who was a lawyer from the opposition  NP,  and  Mr
De Villiers from the FF.

We were a bunch of lawyers and when a law came to  that  committee,  it  was
ripped to pieces and fixed again, over and over again. It was a lot of  fun.
When we first came here there was a Mr Alex van Breda. He  used  to  be  the
Chief Whip of the NP in the years before we came here  in  1994.  There  was
this young 31-year-old lawyer called Moosa. Van Breda, who  had  never  been
challenged as the Chief Whip of the NP in the  old  days,  suddenly  had  to
contend with an arrogant 31-year-old, and  I  must  tell  hon  members  that
there were brawls!

Mr Surty, the Chief Whip, will remember the brawls which  lasted  until  the
day Mr Van Breda left. Mrs Lubidla will remember that he sat  on  the  other
side - and if members were to go to the Hansard they would see  this  -  and
said: ``I never  thought  that  I  would  leave  Parliament  because  of  an
individual. That man sitting across the bench, Mr Moosa, is one of the  good
reasons why I think my time is up and I should leave.'' I will never  forget
that day.

So there were some exciting times. We had to collapse  and  break  down  all
the apartheid laws when we came here in 1994. Laws  such  as  the  detention
laws and others were still in place, and  we  had  to  systematically  break
them down. There were no rules in this place. We had to put  new  rules  and
structures in place.

We also had to set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In  addition,
there was the new constitutional process; the Bill  of  Rights;  Chapter  8,
the judicial chapter, etc. In  my  recent  years  in  the  Economic  Affairs
committee we had very exciting things, ie the National Industrial  Strategy,
the mining law, and the Equality Bill that I had to chair, etc.

I have had some very good times in these past nine  years,  really  exciting
years, and I have learned a lot. When I came here at the age of 31  years  I
was a little boy, but I have become a man in the past  nine  years.  I  have
grown emotionally and politically as an individual. I would  like  to  thank
all hon members, every single one of them,  for  these  very  exciting  nine
years. I will never forget those years. All the members, every one of  them,
have coloured it in some way, and have had an influence on the fabric of  my
life. That will be with me for the rest of my life.

In conclusion, I want to say that there were a few  members  -  people  like
the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, Mr  Surty  -  who  made  an  indelible
impression in my life, and I want to thank them. I want to thank  Ms  Naledi
Pandor and yourself, Ntate Bhengu, for the very, very good  discussions  and
good times we had. I also  want  to  thank  the  members  of  my  provincial
delegation, comrade Joyce Kgoali and other comrades. I want  to  thank  them
for the nine years of exciting times;  a  time  of  growth.  I  will  always
remember them. They should please not forget that I am here.  I  am  leaving
the NCOP, but I remain a committed member of the ANC, committed to a  better
life for all, wherever I go and in whatever I do. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, Mr  Moosa.  Perhaps  I  can
steal one second to say that I  am  also  very  grateful  to  have  had  the
opportunity to work with you, specifically in the select committee  and  the
joint standing committee. What has fascinated me about you is your  incisive
and perceptive mind.

Secondly, you have great respect for others, something which is  lacking  in
quite a number of us.

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, this Bill seeks to amend the  Merchandise  Marks
Act, so that intrusive or ambush marketing becomes  illegal.  It  gives  the
Minister wide discretionary powers in this respect, and  applies  to  events
and protected events in that no person may use a trademark  in  relation  to
such an event in a manner that is calculated to achieve publicity  for  that
trademark.

The motivation behind these amendments  is  to  give  the  sponsors  of  the
Cricket World Cup 2003 the right to market the event  to  the  exclusion  of
others. This Bill  has  severe  implications  for  small  businesses.  Small
business can, therefore, not market and sell their products  freely  at  the
cricket events, which will be to the detriment  of  especially  poor  people
trying to make a living.

Lastly, we also  feel  that  this  Bill  has  been  rushed  through  without
adequate  consultation  and  without  consolidation  from  the   competition
authorities, as well as  representation  by  small  business.  The  DP  can,
therefore, not support this Bill. [Interjections.]

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  members,  I  am  informed
that the Whippery have agreed that there be just one debate for the  eighth,
ninth and 10th Orders of the Day.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
     AFFAIRS - INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST
 BOMBINGS; INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF
    TERRORISM; PROTOCOL ON THE CONTROL OF FIREARMS, AMMUNITION AND OTHER
                    RELATED MATERIALS IN THE SADC REGION

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Mr Chairperson, the bombings  that  took  place  in  the
past few weeks are still haunting some  of  us.  South  Africans  are  being
subjected to faceless and cowardly bombers  who  are  trying  to  provoke  a
state of terror among the general public.

This reminds me of the debate we had in the committee, where  members  tried
to define terrorism. I remember that  hon  members  like  Joyce  Kgoali  and
Beauty  Dlulane  were  very  vocal  in  trying  to  define  terrorism.   The
International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings  and  the
International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing  of  Terrorism
will provide important tools to the Government of South Africa and the  SAPS
in their campaign against terrorism.

The two treaties require parties to criminalise  the  prescribed  behaviour,
ie  engaging  in  international  terrorists  bombings  and  fundraising  for
international terrorism, and to either arrest and extradite the offender  to
another country that has jurisdiction to prosecute, or submit the  case  for
prosecution.

The committee was unanimous  in  endorsing  these  treaties.  No  democratic
country can tolerate terrorism; no self-respecting country would  sugar-coat
terrorism, no matter how  people  could  try  to  justify  certain  actions.
Terrorism has got no place in a democratic country.

Under the Convention  for  the  Suppression  of  Terrorist  Bombings,  South
Africa will be required to, among other things, establish jurisdiction  over
and make punishable under our  democratic  and  domestic  law  the  offences
described; to  extradite  or  submit  for  prosecution  persons  accused  of
committing or aiding in the commission of the offences; and to assist  other
countries in connection with criminal proceedings under the convention.

Under the Convention for the Suppression  of  the  Financing  of  Terrorism,
South Africa will be required to take appropriate  measures,  in  accordance
with its domestic legal principles, to ensure the  detection  and  freezing,
seizing or forfeiting of any funds used or  allocated  for  the  purpose  of
committing the offences described.

I know members are aware that, as a country, we are currently busy  drafting
the required antiterrorism legislation which will make it  possible  for  us
to implement these two treaties or conventions. At the same time,  as  South
Africans, we are mindful of  the  fact  that  there  is  a  vast  difference
between terrorist activity and a struggle for self-determination.  Unlike  a
certain country which has been playing big brother, we do  not  confuse  the
two.

We also believe that international co-operation to combat  terrorism  should
be  conducted  in  conformity  with  the  principles  of  the  UN   Charter,
international law  and  relevant  conventions.  These  treaties,  formulated
under the auspices of the UN, allow us to  formulate  a  joint  response  to
terrorism, taking into account the  concerns  regarding  the  definition  of
terrorism and  the  unilateral  use  of  action  in  the  violation  of  the
principles of the UN Charter and international law.

I want to deal with the SADC Protocol on  Firearms.  There  are  people  who
easily use or display firearms as if they are displaying their front  teeth.
It also takes them not more than an hour to manufacture them.  South  Africa
is mindful of the need to prevent, combat and eradicate  the  manufacturing,
trafficking, possession and use of firearms and ammunition.

We believe that there is an urgent need for effective control of  these.  As
a country, we have already taken a number  of  steps  to  curb  the  use  of
firearms and other related  material.  Members  will  recall  that  we  have
passed a new Firearms Control Act and Parliament  is  currently  considering
the explosive Bill. The SADC protocol  can  only  serve  to  strengthen  and
complement these efforts.

The committee has mandated yours truly, on behalf of the department and  the
whole country, to ask the House to support and endorse these  treaties.  The
committee  I  am  referring  to,  ie   the   committee   on   security   and
constitutional affairs, is not like an ordinary committee. This  year  alone
it managed to pass 20 Bills in this Chamber.

This powerful committee also managed to influence this  Council  to  endorse
16 treaties, excluding these ones. As  members  are  aware,  that  does  not
include their normal interaction with the departments  or  their  visits  to
the provinces. That is the committee I am talking about.

It is now my pleasure and privilege to,  once  again,  on  behalf  of  these
dedicated troops, submit these three treaties to the hon members to  do  the
right thing. [Applause.]
