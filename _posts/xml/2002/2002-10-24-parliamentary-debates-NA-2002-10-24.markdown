                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mrs P TSHWETE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the theme of the month of October is ``the  rights  of  the
           child''; and


       (b)  further notes that that the Department of Social Development is
           considering legislation that will provide a comprehensive
           framework for the promotion of children's rights and the
           protection of children against abuse and exploitation;


  (2) believes that this reflects the commitment of the ANC Government to
       defending and upholding the rights of children and the ANC's
       commitment to creating a caring society and a nation that embraces
       the value of ``every child is my child''; and


  (3) welcomes the initiatives of the Department of Social Development to
       pioneer legislation which will protect and uphold the rights of
       children ...

[Time expired.] [Applause.]
Adv P S SWART: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its regret at the murder of British tourist, Diane Conway,
       in Mpumalanga on Tuesday;


  (2) conveys its condolences to her husband, who was wounded in the
       incident, and to her family;


  (3) notes that thousands of South Africans are murdered each year,
       including 108 police officers so far in 2002;


  (4) welcomes media reports that a large number of detectives have been
       detailed to track down Mrs Conway's killer; but


  (5) insists that the murder of South Africans receives the same attention
       and careful investigation to provide an effective deterrent to crime.

Prince N E ZULU: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  I  shall  move,  on
behalf of the IFP, on the next sitting day of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) appreciates the normalisation of port operations in the Durban
       harbour after the disruptions caused by the Cosatu strike called to
       oppose the Government's liberalisation of the economy early this
       month;


  (2) notes that the port of Durban is the most important in Africa and the
       largest in the southern hemisphere, and that targeting it for
       disruption has dire consequences for an untold number of innocent
       people in the hemisphere; and


  (3) calls on the Government to review the commitment of the tripartite
       alliance to the philosophy of a shared economy which attracts foreign
       investment or a rigid nationalised stereotype.

Mr N H MASITHELA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the window period allowing political representatives to cross
           the floor at local government level ended on Tuesday, 22 October
           2002; and


       (b)  this period has resulted in a reconfiguration of the political
           landscape and realignment of political forces in the country;


  (2) believes that the new political realignment represents a rejection of
       the racial polarisation of the country's political paradigm
       engineered by the DA's ``fight back'' strategy;


  (3) welcomes the new political realignment and reconfiguration of the
       political landscape; and


  (4) calls on the DA to reconsider its strategies as they only perpetuate
       racial divisions amongst the people of South Africa.

[Applause.]

Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Voorsitter, ek stel namens die Nuwe NP voor:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met misnoeë kennis neem van die volgende growwe, rassistiese,
       beledigende uitlating wat Dinsdag per selfoon aan 'n lid van die Nuwe
       NP gestuur is:


         'n Hotnot kon nog nie 'n teelepel ontwerp nie. Hoe het jy gedink,
         gaan julle dit regkry om George oor te neem. Julle is te ...
         onnosel. Lank lewe die DA - Die Baas.

[Tussenwerpsels.]


  (2) verder kennis neem dat die Nuwe NP in besit is van die nommer
       waarvandaan dit gestuur is en, ongeag die sender van hierdie
       boodskap, die Menseregtekommissie gaan versoek om hierdie saak
       dringend te ondersoek; en


  (3) tesame met die Nuwe NP, hierdie haatspraak in 'n baie ernstige lig
       beskou en glo dat Suid-Afrikaners dit ten sterkste sal veroordeel,
       want Suid-Afrika het nie plek vir mense met hierdie gesindheid nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion
follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN: Chairperson, I move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with disappointment the following rude, racist, insulting
       expression that was sent per cellphone to a New NP member on Tuesday:


         'n Hotnot kon nog nie 'n teelepel ontwerp nie. Hoe het jy gedink
         gaan julle dit regkry om George oor te neem. Julle is te f...
         onnosel. Lank lewe die DA - Die Baas.


  (2) further notes that the New NP is in possession of the number from
       which it was sent and, regardless of the sender of this message, will
       request the Human Rights Commission to urgently investigate this
       matter; and


  (3) together with the New NP, views this hate speech in a very serious
       light and believes that South Africans will strongly condemn this,
       because South Africa does not have room for people with such an
       attitude.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the UDM at the next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) acknowledges the importance of tourism to the South African economy,
       and its positive contribution to job creation;


  (2) notes that the success of the South African tourism industry has
       resulted in South Africa being one of the best performing tourist
       destinations in the world in the past year;


  (3) condemns the criminal violence to which some tourists have been
       exposed during their visits to South Africa, recognising that such
       attacks have a direct effect on South Africa's desirability as a
       tourist destination;
  (4) extends its sympathy to the Conway family and to Mr John Conway, who
       is currently in a Nelspruit hospital, after being shot and witnessing
       the death of his wife at the hands of a criminal in their hotel room
       in Mpumalanga; and


  (5) urges the Government to ensure the safety of visitors to this
       country.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move, on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC in the Free State held a successful meeting with a
       broad spectrum of the Afrikaner community in the Braam Fischer
       Building, Bloemfontein, yesterday;


  (2) further notes that this historic meeting provided a platform for
       South Africans with different backgrounds to engage in a dialogue on
       issues which are of mutual concern;
  (3) believes that dialogues of this nature contribute positively towards
       new patriotism, nonracialism and nation-building;


  (4) congratulates the ANC in the Free State on embarking on this historic
       dialogue; and


  (5) urges all organisations and leaders to emulate this example and
       encourage dialogue amongst South Africans in order to build national
       unity and reconciliation.

[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die  volgende
sittingsdag, namens die AEB, sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis –


  (1) kennis neem van 'n klaarblyklik regeringsbetaalde radio-advertensie
       waarin versoening en verandering in Suid-Afrika voorgehou word;
  (2) ook kennis neem dat hierdie advertensie, in sy poging om 'n
       verbeterde situasie sedert 1994 te illustreer, onder andere 'n
       uitspraak van voormalige minister Carel de Wet oor kontak oor die
       kleurskeidslyn aanhaal, asook die uitspraak van die oud-minister van
       justisie, Jimmy Kruger, dat ``ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. die dood van Steve Biko hom koud
       laat'';

[Tussenwerpsels.]


  (3) saamstem dat 'n aanhoudende selektiewe fokus op die foute van een
       groep in die verlede, nie versoening nie, maar vervreemding in die
       hand werk, en ook nie, soos die nuwe Uitsaaiwet vereis, in die
       openbare belang is nie;


  (4) glo dat die tyd aangebreek het om die sogenaamde ``sondes van die
       vaders'' te begrawe en daardie hoofstuk af te sluit; en


     5) die Regering en die SABC versoek om die advertensie te staak en te
        vervang deur een wat nie teer op die verlede nie, maar op die
        toekoms fokusseer.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note of a radio advertisement, apparently paid for by
       Government in which reconciliation and change is favoured;


  (2) also notes that this advertisement, in its effort to illustrate an
       improved situation since 1994, inter alia quotes a statement made by
       former minister Carel de Wet about contact across the colour bar, as
       well as the statement by the former minister of Justice, Jimmy
       Kruger, that the death of Steve Biko left him cold;


  (3) agrees that the repeatedly selective focus on the mistakes of one
       group in the past does not bring about reconciliation, but
       estrangement and this is not, as required by the new Broadcasting
       Act, in the public's interest;


  (4) believes that the time has come to bury the so-called "sins of the
       fathers" and close that chapter; and


  (5) requests the Government and the SABC to discontinue the advertisement
       and replace it with one that does not hanker back to the past, but
       focuses on the future.]

Mr N MTHETHWA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC Policy Conference of 2002 resolved that -


       (a)  the Government must expedite the separation of social security
           from social development; and,


       (b)  consistent with this resolution, the Cabinet has approved the
           establishment of the SA Social Security Agency to distribute
           social grants;


  (2) believes that the establishment of the Social Security Agency will
       improve the distribution of social grants and will extend the social
       net to include all people who qualify for social security;


  (3) further believes that the establishment of the Social Security Agency
       will contribute to rolling back the frontiers of poverty; and


  (4) welcomes the plans to establish the Social Security Agency.

[Applause.]

Mr B G BELL: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its dismay at efforts by the ANC mayor of Govan Mbeki
       municipality, Mdibanisi Tsheke, to reinstate a council official who
       was dismissed after being found guilty on multiple fraud, corruption
       and misconduct charges;


  (2) condemns the mayor's suspension of the municipal manager on gross
       insubordination charges for refusing to reinstate the guilty
       official;


  (3) demands a full forensic investigation into this matter as well as
       allegations that tenders were awarded to companies which made large
       donations to the mayor's soccer club; and


  (4) calls on the ANC in Mpumalanga to clean up corruption in the
       province.

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on  the
next sitting day of the House on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that five of the eight South African beaches that were recently
       accredited with ``blue flag'' status are located in the province of
       KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) further notes that ``blue flag'' status is a well-known environmental
       and tourism campaign in Europe, providing local and international
       visitors with proof that the awarded beaches adhere to international
       safety, cleanliness and other tourist standards; and


  (3) congratulates all eight beaches accredited with this honour and hopes
       that they will maintain the high standards they have set.
Ms E THABETHE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that South Africa will appoint an ambassador to the World Trade
       Organisation in Geneva;


  (2) further notes that the imminent appointment of the ambassador
       reflects the ANC Government's acknowledgement of globalisation and
       global structures of economic governance;


  (3) believes that this will provide an opportunity for South Africa to
       effectively lobby and network during the current Doha round of the
       World Trade Organisation's negotiations which, amongst other things,
       are designed to put pressure on the European Union, Japan and the US
       to scale down heavy subsidies to their farmers;


  (4) also believes the massive scaling down of subsidies to farmers in the
       countries of the north will level the playing field and will allow
       commodities and agricultural products from developing countries to
       compete on an equal footing with those of the north;


  (5) further believes that this reflects the commitment of the ANC
       Government to building a better and fairer world for all; and


  (6) welcomes the decision of the ANC Government to appoint an ambassador
       to the World Trade Organisation.

[Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the approval by Cabinet yesterday of legislation which
       provides for compulsory testing for HIV of rape suspects if requested
       by the rape victim, and urges the Government to bring it to
       Parliament as soon as possible;


  (2) believes this is a victory for all the women of South Africa as a
       measure to combat violence against women and the spread of HIV/Aids;


  (3) notes that this has been part of the New NP's policy on  measures  to
       combat Aids and protect victims of rape since 1999 and that  the  New
       NP has supported this at every opportunity; and


  (4) also believes it can look forward to many positive outcomes from the
       close co-operation between the ANC and the New NP in terms of their
       co-operative governance agreement.

[Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, I shall move at the next sitting of the House:
  That the House -


  (1) acknowledges that the founding principles of the African Union and
       Nepad are rooted in the principle of human rights, and, without its
       enforcement, any other political and economic successes achieved
       under the auspices of these programmes will not bring an improvement
       to the lives of the people of Africa;


  (2) further acknowledges that human rights abuses lend credence to the
       incidence of Afro-pessimism and the negative perceptions of the
       African continent;


  (3) notes with concern the continued occurrence of various forms of gross
       human rights abuses, including such atrocities as the systematic rape
       of innocent civilians, military and police-inspired torture and the
       use of children in warfare in many parts of the African continent
       from the Ivory Coast to Burundi, from the Democratic Republic of
       Congo to Zimbabwe, and from Rwanda to Sudan - and that the death in
       detention of Learnmore Jongwe, a Zimbabwean MP, is an example;


  (4) unreservedly condemns the occurrence of such human rights  abuses  as
       antithetical to the dignity of African people; and ...

                       JUDICIAL MATTERS AMENDMENT BILL

       (Consideration of Report of Portfolio Committee on Justice and
                     Constitutional Development thereon)

Report adopted without debate.

                  ADMINISTRATION OF ESTATES AMENDMENT BILL
                       JUDICIAL MATTERS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, colleagues, I will be dealing with two separate pieces of
legislation during this input, beginning with a piece of legislation whose
discriminatory provisions need to be relegated to the legislative dustbin
as swiftly as possible, so that we can completely eliminate any distinction
in terms of race when dealing with intestate estates.

Although it is now nearly nine years since our country's transition to a
society based on democratic values, social justice and fundamental human
rights, we are still faced with an anachronistic and discriminatory piece
of legislation on our Statute Book, namely the Black Administration Act.

The existence of this piece of legislation has, since 1994, been a constant
and painful reminder of this country's deeply divided past. The
Constitutional Court recently pointed out that the concepts on which the
Act was based, ``the memories it evokes, the language it continues to
employ and the division it still enforces are antithetical to the society
envisaged by the Constitution''.
There can be no doubt that we would have wanted to do away with this
archaic Act long ago. However, the obstacles created by this Act are
difficult to resolve without delay because they relate to practical
problems of administration and policy questions, which relate to achieving
equality in our society.

The Constitutional Court faced a similar question. As one of the presiding
judges asked at the time:


  How, then, may we cleanse our Statute Book of all traces of a law which
  was a pillar of the past, of a deeply divided society characterised by
  strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice, while at the same time
  preventing undue dislocation and hardship?

I am referring to the case of Moseneke v The Master in which the
Constitutional Court declared a section of the Black Administration Act of
1927 inconsistent with the Constitution.

I will not do justice to this debate if I do not briefly refer to the
contents of a section of the Act and the main objects of the Bill now
before us. I am, however, happy to announce that the promotion of this Bill
represents another nail in the coffin of the Black Administration Act.

The offending section provided that if a black person died without a valid
will, the appointment of an executor was not necessary and, further, that
the Master did not have powers in connection with the administration and
distribution of the relevant estate. The Constitutional Court also declared
regulation 3(1) of 6 February 1987, which was made in terms of the
provisions of the Act, invalid, but suspended the order of invalidity until
6 December 2002.

It is important to note that reporting an intestate estate of a black
person was previously confined to magistrates' offices, and the court
subsequently ordered that the regulation should be interpreted so that the
beneficiaries of an intestate black estate had the choice of reporting the
estate to a magistrate or the Master. It should be emphasised that the
Constitutional Court's decision dealt with estates that devolve according
to common law and not with estates that devolve according to customary law.

The Bill proposes that an estate of a deceased person, which does not
devolve according to customary law must be administered under the control
of the Master of the High Court. The Bill states clearly that the Master
will not have jurisdiction or functions in respect of any property that
devolves according to customary law.

I wish to point out that this Bill should be regarded as an interim
measure. This is because the SA Law Commission's investigation into the
customary law of succession is in its final stages of completion. We
eagerly await the relevant report from the commission.

The law of succession dictates who the beneficiaries of a deceased person
are. The rules for the administration of estates, on the other hand,
prescribe the procedure for the administration of the estate, namely how
creditors should be paid and how benefits should be transferred to
beneficiaries. Under customary law where a beneficiary steps into the shoes
of the deceased, there is no clear distinction between the rules for the
administration of estates and the law of succession.

Pending the finalisation of the Law Commission's review of the customary
law of succession, no changes are proposed to the administration of estates
that devolve according to customary law.

The Moseneke judgment pointed out to us that the benefits of administering
deceased estates by magistrates, such as convenience and low cost, can also
be accomplished by a nondiscriminatory provision. The Justice department
considered all possibilities and concluded that the best way to reap the
benefits of a central records system, while achieving service accessibility
across the board, was to administer all estates under the control of the
Master.
The Bill therefore inserts a new section in the Administration of Estates
Act in terms of which provision is made for the designation of service
points where officials of the department will exercise functions on behalf
of and under the direction of the Master. The new section provides that the
Minister may designate officials at service points to exercise powers and
perform duties on behalf of and under the direction of the Master. The
relevant provision was based on statistics and information of officers who
currently fulfil certain functions regarding the administration of estates
at magistrates' offices.

Turning to the second Bill, it is almost traditional that a Judicial
Matters Amendment Bill, the purpose of which is to correct deficiencies
that may have arisen in practice in certain Acts of Parliament and to
repeal certain redundant provisions, comes at the end of a parliamentary
session. The Bill usually contains a variety of amendments which do not
require individual amending Bills. The Bill before Parliament today is no
exception - it is a real omnibus of legislation.
I do not intend explaining the technical amendments to the House today.
Many are straightforward and require no explanation. Allow me to make a few
remarks about some of the provisions which have a little more substance.

A few of the amendments in the Bill bring some older provisions on our
Statute Book into line with the constitutional dispensation, such as the
amendment to the Stock Theft Act of 1959, which is intended to address an
undesirable presumption in line with a judgment of the Constitutional
Court. In a similar vein, the amendments to sections 415 and 417 of the
Companies Act emanate from judgments of our Constitutional Court from which
we obtained guidance.

These amendments, in keeping with the right against self-incrimination,
prohibit self-incriminating evidence obtained in interrogation proceedings,
as contemplated in the Companies Act, from being used in subsequent
criminal proceedings, except in perjury-related criminal proceedings.

We are amending a section of the Magistrates' Courts Act of 1994 which
allows the court to rescind default judgments in cases in which plaintiffs
have agreed in writing that such judgments be rescinded. This will come as
a relief to many poor debtors who have found themselves in financial
difficulties and who get court orders against them, causing untold hardship
when they later try to obtain credit of any sort.

Often the debt in question is subsequently paid in full, but yet the debtor
still has to bear the consequences of having a court order against him or
her. In many cases, the people involved are those most marginalised in our
society, those who are so often exploited, particularly within the credit
framework.

The General Law Amendment Act of 1962, among others, provides that a person
who has sole custody of his or her minor child in terms of an order of
court and who, contrary to such order, refuses the other parent access to
the child, is guilty of an offence. These provisions also criminalise the
failure of a sole custodian parent to notify the noncustodian parent of a
change of address of the sole custodian parent. The Bill seeks to amend
that provision in order to make it clear that the provision will apply to
any custodian parent, whether sole or not.

The Bill also amends the SA Law Commission Act so as to effect a name
change; it will now be known as the SA Law Reform Commission. This will
focus attention on the core business of the commission, and that is dealing
with law reform. The amendment will also bring the commission's reporting
obligations in line with those of the Public Finance Management Act.

I have so much more to say, but I will just limit myself to closing
remarks. I thank, once again, the very diligent portfolio committee members
and their chair, as well as the officials who supported them through the
process. I propose that the Bill be accepted by the House. [Applause.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Chairperson ... [Interjections.] Listen, your party has
received so many hidings this week I would have thought that you would keep
quiet today.

Chairperson, I rise on behalf of the ANC in unconditional support of these
two pieces of legislation, namely the Administration of Estates Amendment
Bill and the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill. I will constrain my comments
today to the former, that is the Administration of Estates Amendment Bill.

Once again, this House, unfortunately, has to deal with an aspect of the
Black Administration Act of 1927. I would like to remind this House that on
26 September 2000, during the passing of the Limitation of Legal
Proceedings Against Government Institutions Bill, this House adopted a
report on that occasion which dealt with the Black Administration Act. In
terms of paragraph 6 of that report, the House accepted the following, and
I quote:


  The Committee expresses its concern that it had to amend the Black
  Administration Act, 1927 (Act No. 38 of 1927), once again, on a piecemeal
  basis. The Committee is aware that the said Act was one of the
  cornerstones of the previous dispensation and reflects many of the
  injustices of the past. The Committee also expresses the view that it is
  unacceptable that six years after the new constitutional dispensation
  came into being, the above-mentioned Act has still not been reviewed in
  its entirety with a view to bringing it into line with the Constitution.
  In this regard, it was further brought to the Committee's attention that
  on 5 September 2000 the High Court of Pretoria, in the case of D E
  Moseneke and Others v The Master of the High Court (Case No. 20006/2000),
  declared the provisions of clause 3(1) of the Regulations promulgated in
  terms of the above-mentioned Act to be invalid, unconstitutional and of
  no force and effect. In the light of the above, the Committee recommends
  that each Member of the Executive who is responsible for a Department
  that administers specific sections of the above-mentioned Act, and
  especially those Members who are responsible for the Departments of Home
  Affairs, Justice and Constitutional Development and Land Affairs, be
  requested to review the sections which their respective Departments
  administer with a view to bringing those sections into line with the
  Constitution. As it appears that the above-mentioned Act is administered
  by various different government structures, which may explain why no
  Department is taking responsibility for the review of the whole Act, the
  Committee recommends that this matter also be brought to the attention of
  the President. The Committee urges the Minister for Justice and
  Constitutional Development to consider referring the review of the whole
  of the above-mentioned Act to the South African Law Commission as a
  project of the highest priority.

Now from the briefings that we have received, I have to say, unfortunately,
that not much seems to have happened in this regard. The matter has been
referred to the Law Commission, but the Law Commission still has not
appointed a committee to research the matter. They are in the process of
doing so, and that means that it is still going to be some time before we
have a review of this Act.

As far as I can establish, it also seems that none of the departments that
administer aspects of this Bill have brought any legislation before
Parliament, except, of course, for this piece of legislation, to deal with
the matter before us today. We would, once again from the committee, urge
that this matter be moved forward as fast as possible. We all know that
this Bill was a cornerstone of the previous dispensation and it really
needs to be removed rapidly from the Statute Book.

Now, let me deal with a specific matter before us today in respect of the
Black Administration Act and that is the amendments that we brought about
in this Administration of Estates Amendment Bill. I start with a quote by
Judge Sachs in the Moseneke judgment, and it reads as follows:


  The Black Administration Act has been described by this Court as an
  ``egregious apartheid law which anachronistically has survived our
  transition to a nonracial democracy''. Subordinate legislation made under
  it has been referred to as part of a demeaning and racist system, as
  obnoxious, and as not befitting a democratic society based on human
  dignity, equality and freedom. The Act systematised and enforced a
  colonial form of relationship between a dominant white minority who were
  to have rights of citizenship and a subordinate black majority who were
  to be administered.


  ... It is painful that the Act still survives at all. The concepts on
  which it was based, the memories it evokes, the language it continues to
  employ, and the division it still enforces, are antithetical to the
  society envisaged by the Constitution. It is an affront to all of us that
  people are still treated as ``blacks'' rather than as ordinary persons
  seeking to wind up a deceased estate, and it is in conflict with the
  establishment of a nonracial society where rights and duties are no
  longer determined by origin or skin colour.

It is this issue we are addressing today, because Judge Sachs then went
further to declare section 23(7)(a) of the Black Administration Act
inconsistent with the Constitution and invalid with immediate effect. This
section provided that the appointment of an executor was not necessary in,
nor did the Master of the High Court have any powers in connection with,
the administration and distribution of the estate of any black person who
died without leaving a valid will. Previously, of course, under the Black
Administration Act, such estates were dealt with as intestate estates of
black persons and, of course, within the magistrates' court.

Judge Sachs, further, also found that Regulation 3(1) of Regulation 200 of
1987 to be invalid and suspended the order of invalidity until 6 December
2002. This is why we are urgently passing this law today, of course, to
meet that deadline. The court ordered that the regulation should be
interpreted so that beneficiaries of an intestate estate of a black person
had a choice to report the estate to a magistrate or the Master. The court
emphasised that the decision deals with estates which devolve according to
common law only, and not with estates which devolve according to customary
law.

What all this means in a nutshell is that during the previous dispensation
the administration of estates was dealt with on a racial basis. If one was
a white person, then one's intestate estate was dealt with in terms of the
Administration of Estates Act and the rules and regulations which emanated
from that legislation, and the Master's office was the institution which
looked after and dealt with the estate. If one was classified an African
person, then one's intestate estate would fall under the Black
Administration Act, and the magistrates' court would deal with the matter
in terms of different rules and regulations.

This, now, is being taken away ...

Mr G B D McINTOSH: [Inaudible.]
Adv J H DE LANGE: You were one of those who supported those laws, so I
would not be too loud if I were you.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Oh, do you think so?

Adv J H DE LANGE: Yes. Go and look at the records. You will see you people
supported that law.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: You are ignorant.

Adv J H DE LANGE: No, I am not ignorant. You are the ignorant one, because
you are the ones that supported such laws that created such racial
divisions in our country.

Mr M J ELLIS: Do not talk rubbish, Johnny.

Adv J H DE LANGE: Go and look at the law. You will see who supported it. I
have looked at it. Go and look at it. [Interjections.] You got a hiding
this week already; do not get another hiding today. Be careful.
[Interjections.] You used to have a lot of councils in the Western Cape.
Today you only have nine councils left. We have 22 councils.
[Interjections.] That I call a hiding. If I were you I would keep quiet. I
would not raise these issues. [Interjections.] In any case, let us get back
to the unbundling of racism, as supported by yourselves.

The unbundling of racism is as follows. As I have explained, those laws
will no longer be the same. In terms of this judgment, African people were
now given an option. They could either deal with the matter in terms of the
Master's office or they could deal with it in terms of the magistrates'
court.

This regime will only be in place until 6 December. Once we have passed
this Bill, then the Act will come into operation on 5 December. From that
moment onwards, for the first time ever in this country, the estates of
whites and blacks who have died and who have not left a will, will
henceforth be dealt with in terms of the same law - the Administration of
the Estates Act - and by the same institution - the Master's office.
Of course, there was one worry which we did have in this regard and that
was that Masters' offices are only situated in a few places in this
country, usually the seat of a High Court. We were very worried that poor
people and people in rural areas would have difficulty accessing Masters'
offices. So we have also changed the law to allow the department now to
appoint an official at a court who acts on behalf of and under the Master
in each magistrates' court.

Henceforth, blacks and whites will still be able to do what blacks did in
the past. They will be able to go to the magistrates' court and deal with
their administration of estate matters generally, but intestate estate
matters in particular, at the magistrates' court. The only difference is
that this will be done under a different law and the official will now act
as a representative of the Master's office.

May I also just thank all those persons involved in making sure that this
piece of legislation was at last brought before Parliament in order for us
to get rid of something rather obnoxious from our past. I would,
particularly, like to thank Mr Cronje of the Law Commission and Mr Koos van
der Merwe, not this House's Koos van der Merwe, another Koos van der Merwe
- there are so many of them in the Master's office - for all their efforts
in this regard. [Laughter.]

Then, lastly, to show that I am magnanimous, I really want to thank all the
opposition parties in this Parliament for supporting this piece of
legislation and for getting rid of what some of them caused, created and
supported in the past. [Applause.]

Mnr N J J van R KOORNHOF: Mnr die Voorsitter, sedert my vertrek in 1998 om
regeringsdiens te gaan verrig in die Wes-Kaapse regering, lewer ek vandag,
ná bykans vier jaar, weer 'n toespraak in dié raadsaal.

Agb LEDE: Hoor, hoor!

Mnr N J J van R KOORNHOF: Dit is lekker om terug te wees, en nog steeds so
baie bekende gesigte te sien. Dit is vandag nie 'n nuwelingstoespraak nie,
maar 'n hertoetredingstoespraak, en dit sal kort wees. Ek praat ook, soos
die agb De Lange, oor die eerste deel van hierdie wetgewing. Ek hoop om in
die komende maande wat oorbly van hierdie termyn, 'n positiewe en opbouende
rol in hierdie raadsaal te speel.

Die DP verwelkom die wysigings aan hierdie wetgewing. Soos gestel deur die
agb Adjunkminister en die agb De Lange, moes hierdie wysigings lankal reeds
plaasgevind het. Die SA Regskommissie is nou al geruime tyd besig met die
hersiening van die erfreg, veral met betrekking tot die inheemse reg. Dit
is 'n jammerte dat hierdie proses altyd so tydsaam verloop. Alhoewel die SA
Regskommissie 'n verduideliking gee daarvoor, is die vertraging nié altyd
goed vir die bouproses om vertroue te vestig in 'n regstelsel nie.

Die SA Regskommissie moet nog terugrapporteer oor die harmonisering van die
inheemse reg en die gemene reg rakende die erfreg. Dit is veral belangrik
dat die regte van vroue hier beskerming moet kry. Nog te dikwels veroorsaak
die sinergie tussen ras, geslag en kultuurgewoontes die vermoë om te
diskrimineer, veral teenoor weduwees.

Te dikwels nog word menseregte ondergeskik gestel aan die gesag van 'n
tradisionele hiërargie. Natuurlik is dit belangrik dat 'n balans tussen die
inheemse reg en die gemene reg gehandhaaf moet word, maar daar is 'n
verpligting om die regte wat in die Grondwet beskerm word, ook te beliggaam
in die daaglikse weë en wandel van burgers, en dit vind plaas deur
wetgewing.

Die huidige wetswysigings word verwelkom en reguleer nou minstens die
administrasie van alle intestate boedels, buiten dié wat deur die inheemse
reg beheer word, vir die eerste keer onder die heerskappy van die Meester
van die Hooggeregshof, soos genoem deur die agb De Lange. Die feit dat
landdroshowe nou dienspunte vir die Meesterskantoor se personeel word, is
'n voorwaartse stap vir dienslewering in die land.
Dit is goed om kennis te neem dat die bogenoemde dienspunte nou ook
beskikbaar is vir die publiek ten opsigte van alle ander
Meesterskantooraangeleenthede. Dit is 'n baie gunstige verbetering. Ek hoop
en vertrou dat die Meesterskantoor se personeel vinnig en effektief
ontplooi sal word binne die landdroskantore.

Die DP steun graag die wetswysigings. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr N J J VAN R KOORNHOF: Mr Chairperson, since my departure in 1998 to go
and perform Government service in the Western Cape government, I am again,
after almost four years, delivering a speech in this chamber.

Hon MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

Mr N J J VAN R KOORNHOF: It is nice to be back, and still to see so many
familiar faces. This is not a maiden speech today, but a re-entrance speech
and it will be short. I am also speaking, like the hon De Lange, about the
first part of this legislation. I hope to play a positive and constructive
role in this chamber in the coming months remaining in this term.

The DP welcomes the amendments to this legislation. As stated by the hon
Deputy Minister and the hon De Lange, these amendments should have taken
place a long time ago. The SA Law Commission has now for a considerable
time been busy with the revision of the law of succession, especially with
regard to indigenous law. It is a pity that this process is always so time
consuming. Although the SA Law Commission does provide an explanation for
it, the delay is not always good for the building process to establish
faith in a legal system.

The SA Law Commission still has to report back on the harmonisation of
indigenous law and common law in connection with the law of succession. It
is especially important that the rights of women should receive protection
here. Too often the synergy between race, gender and cultural customs still
causes the ability to discriminate, especially against widows.
Too often human rights are still made secondary to the authority of a
traditional hierarchy. Of course it is important that a balance should be
maintained between indigenous law and common law, but there is an
obligation also to embody the rights which are protected in the
Constitution in the daily comings and goings of citizens, and this takes
place through legislation.

The current statutory amendments are welcomed and now at least regulate the
administration of all intestate estates, except those which are controlled
by indigenous law, under the authority of the Master of the Supreme Court,
as mentioned by the hon De Lange. The fact that magistrates' courts now
become service points for the personnel of the Master's office is a forward
step for service delivery in the country.

It is good to note that the above-mentioned service points are now also
available to the public in respect of any other Master's office matter. It
is a very favourable improvement. I hope and trust that the personnel of
the Master's office will be deployed in the magistrates' offices quickly
and effectively.

The DP gladly supports the statutory amendments. [Applause.]]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, I rise on behalf of the IFP to fully support
both Bills that are in front of us. Knowing the hon Johnny De Lange as well
as I do, both on the sports field and in Parliament, I know that he gives
more than 16 ounces to the pound. Where he gets the additional ounces from
I do not know, but I will vouch for the fact that he does do that.

This raises a very important and pertinent point in that we who make the
laws, also need to reflect deeply on the laws we are making. This is
because it would indeed be a terrible thing if the legacy we leave behind
is one in which the laws we make today - the things we do badly - have to
be followed and painfully undone by those who succeed us.

In this respect, if one of the laws is still, anachronistically, on the
Statute Book eight years after we have achieved our democracy, the question
then arises: How many more such laws may still be hiding somewhere waiting
to be taken out and replaced, with the old laws consigned to the dustbin?

In that respect, I think we should also say that if Rule 49(5), similarly,
is a Rule that is no longer consistent with our Constitution and no longer
in sync with our Constitution, then how many hundreds, maybe even thousands
of rules and regulations - and I do not think I would be exaggerating if I
said that there may even be ten thousand rules and regulations - are being
used at the moment and do not fit in with the constitutional provisions
that now exist?

This is why it is imperative that the subcommittee that is charged with the
responsibility of looking at delegated legislation should come into being
quickly, because every single one of these rules that is out of sync and
that is still functional and operational is an impediment to someone in
respect of doing business, or going about his or her ordinary life and
doing the ordinary things.

So it would be our function to try to be as reflective as we possibly can
be in order to remove the last remnants of those laws that are still
discriminatory and which still do not function in the spirit of the
Constitution that we now have.

One of the issues we should also highlight here is that it is a great
pleasure to be able to stand up on behalf of an opposition party and give
our full support to legislation that is build on a consensual basis. This
signifies not just to our nation but the world at large that this
Parliament not only believes in the importance of the Constitution but
walks the talk; that not only does it pay lip service to the Constitution
but that, in effect, it is deeply sworn to upholding the Constitution and
to doing every single thing that help not only the Constitution, but also
the great reconciliation process that we have embarked on.

Although my colleague Abram Mzizi sat through the painful, hard hours when
these changes were being made, I have the pleasure to be able to say, on
his and on our party's behalf, that if this spirit prevails, then it is not
only good for the party that is the majority party, but also for Parliament
as a whole; it is good for all of us in the country as a whole that we
continue to respect one another's views, that we continue to build
consensus and that we continue to build laws which we can be proud of in
the future.

This is unlike the laws today which we are repealing, because these laws
were made with a different mindset. They diminished the humanity of the
people who lived in this country and did not accord the human dignity that
all should have been accorded. What we are now doing is affording that
dignity.

What I like about the Administration of Estates Amendment Bill is that it
is going to reach out to rural people; that not only will it be good on the
Statute Book, but it will be good in the way in which it is implemented.
For these reasons the IFP supports these two Bills. [Time expired.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, these Bills are both technical in nature, and
the New NP supports them both. The Judicial Matters Bill is a compendium of
small but necessary technical amendments.

The Administration of Estates Amendment Bill, while technical, is of
significance along the road to building a nonracist and nonsexist
democracy, as other speakers have also pointed out. It not only amends the
Administration of Estates Act, but also a provision in the notorious Black
Administration Act of 1927, a racist and discriminatory piece of
legislation, which is inexplicably still part of our law. I associate
myself with the remarks of other speakers today that this law is a shameful
blot on the body of law applicable in our fledgling democracy, and there
can be no justification whatsoever for its continued existence.

We have Judge Dikgang Moseneke, who is now a candidate for appointment to
the Constitutional Court, to thank for this piece of legislation. By taking
his father's estate to the courts, he successfully challenged the
inherently discriminatory practice of distinguishing between black and
white intestate estates devolving according to the common law - the former
being administered by magistrates, as has been pointed out, and the latter
being administered by the Master of the High Court. He won the case and
Parliament was given a deadline of 6 December to amend the law. As usual,
we are making the deadline by the skin of our teeth.

Although this amendment impacts only on black estates devolving under the
common law and not customary law, it nevertheless raises wider questions
about the customary law of succession. We were advised in the committee by
officials of the Justice department that the regulations under the Black
Administration Act cannot be fully amended or even repealed until the
customary law of succession is amended.

In the meantime, a Bill to amend the customary law of succession is still
bogged down in consultations being conducted by the SA Law Reform
Commission, as it will be known once we pass the Judicial Matters Amendment
Bill before us today.

The original Bill amending the customary law of succession was tabled in
this House in 1998. However, the Government buckled under pressure from
traditional leaders and referred the Bill to the Law Commission. Last
Friday, four years later, the project committee dealing with the Bill for
the commission reported to Parliament's Monitoring Committee on Improvement
of Quality of Life and Status of Women on the progress being made or the
lack of it.

According to the project committee, the first round of investigations and
consultations has been completed. The committee found that women spoke with
one voice in supporting the amending Bill, noting that under the present
customary law of succession women's interests were sidelined and even
compromised, and that race, gender and culture interacted in a way that
discriminated directly and indirectly against black widows.

Traditional leaders were also consulted. While the KwaZulu-Natal leaders,
to their credit, welcomed the projected reforms, traditional leaders from
the Eastern Cape, the Free State, the Northern Province, North West and
Mpumalanga did not accept the elimination of the principle of primogeniture
contained in the draft Bill and rejected many of the reforms.

For this reason and ignoring the unanimous position of women consulted, the
project committee has embarked on another seemingly open-ended round of
consultations. The memorandum to the Bill before this House optimistically
states that the commission has almost finalised its investigation.
Unfortunately, this was not the impression that was given by the project
committee to the women's status committee last Friday. It is a great pity
that the Constitutional Court has not laid down a deadline for the full-
scale reform of the customary law of succession.
Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson, hon members, the UDM fully supports the two
Bills before the House.

The Administration of Estates Amendment Bill shall come into operation on 5
December 2002, or any earlier date as the President may determine by
proclamation in the Gazette. Currently, estates of deceased persons are
administered differently in that all the estates of white persons are
reported to the Master of the High Court, whereas those of blacks are
reported either to a magistrate or to the Master of the High Court.

From 5 December 2002, all persons irrespective of their colour shall report
estates to the Master, except property ``if the devolution of the property
is governed by the principles of customary law, or of the estate of a
person if the devolution of all the property of the person is governed by
the principles of customary law, and no documents in respect of such
property or estate shall be lodged with the Master, except a will or a
document purporting to be a will''.

This Act shall apply in respect of the estate of persons who died on or
after the date of commencement of this Act, and it shall not affect the
estates that have been reported before 5 December 2002. There shall be a
Master's office at each magistrates' office where a deceased estate can be
reported, and all persons appointed or acting in these offices shall
perform duties assigned to them by the Master of the High Court.

The Minister may designate posts in, or additional to, the fixed
establishment of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development
so that people can report a deceased estate without travelling long
distances and/or spending moneys to acquire the services of attorneys, as
is currently the case.

Persons appointed to, or acting in, posts which have been designated by the
Minister, must exercise the powers and perform the duties delegated to them
on behalf of, and under the direction of, the Master.

This Bill will reduce the workload at Masters' offices as some of the
administration of estates will be finalised at the service points within
the area of jurisdiction of the Master. It is now imperative that all
people be informed or educated in one way or another, particularly those in
remote and rural areas. [Time expired.]

Mr M T MASUTHA: Chairperson, hon members, I must apologise to our masses
out there in that I would have loved to give my speech today in both
Tshivenda and Shangaan, but it would have taken a little longer for me to
master reading those languages in Braille. Unfortunately, I did not have
enough time, so I have to speak in English.

We are today seized with the task of considering the Administration of
Estates Amendment Bill of 2002, which seeks to realign our law regarding
the administration of estates of deceased persons in line with our
Constitution, following the ruling of the Constitutional Court in the case
of Moseneke and Others v the Master of the High Court, delivered in 2001.
The Constitutional Court in the aforesaid matter ruled that section
23(7)(a) of the Black Administration Act, 1927 to be inconsistent with the
Constitution and thus invalid with immediate effect. This section rendered
the appointment of an executor unnecessary in, and excluded the Master of
the High Court from, the administration and distribution of ``the estate of
any black'' who died without leaving a valid will.

In like manner, the court also declared regulation 3(1) of R200 Gazette No
10601 of 6 February 1987 invalid, but suspended the order of invalidity
until 6 December 2002, the day immediately after this Act comes into
effect, which is 5 December this year. It ordered that the regulations
should be interpreted in such a way that beneficiaries of ``an intestate
black estate'' have a choice to report the estate to a magistrate or the
Master, that is the reporting of an intestate estate of a black person
having been previously confined to a magistrate. This will basically extend
the possibility of such reporting to be done to the Master as well.
This judgment articulated the view that the benefits of administering
deceased estates by magistrates, such as convenience and low cost, can also
be accomplished in a nondiscrimatory dispensation. The court also
emphasised that the decision dealt with estates that devolve according to
common law only and not with estates that devolve according to customary
law.

After considering the various possibilities, the Department of Justice and
Constitutional Development opted for the administration of all estates
under the control of the Master of the High Court with the designation of
service points where officials of the department would act on behalf of and
under the direction of the Master. This would, in most instances if not
all, be in magistrates' offices. The beauty of this, of course, is that
deceased estates of white people, which, under the current dispensation,
are dealt with by the Master's office, which is located only in High Court
offices in the country - and as hon members know, the High Courts are not
as dispersed across the country as magistrates' offices - can now also be
dealt with at the magistrates' court level, thus extending the benefits of
accessibility and low cost to white people as well.

This will yield the benefit of centralising record keeping and control in
the Master's office whilst, at the same time, maintaining and even
promoting accessibility and assistance for people at grass-roots level on a
nonracial basis.

The officials of the department that I referred to can, for instance, issue
appointments of executors in small estates, convene meetings of
beneficiaries and assist with the finalisation of small estates. In some
cases, however, the officials will merely forward documents to the Master
and assist with enquiries.

Although the Bill before us deals with the administration of deceased
estates and not with the substantive issues of African customary law of
succession, may I beg the House's indulgence to raise some issues relating
to the latter, which is currently a subject of enquiry by the SA Law
Commission.

There are two distinct yet very closely related legal regimes under which
colonial and apartheid rulers governed blacks, namely African customary
law, which is based on customs that have evolved amongst African
communities themselves, and African law which reflected, in the main,
colonial and apartheid rules created specifically to govern Africans
couched mainly in legislation such as the Black Administration Act, No 38
of 1927, the provisions of which the Constitutional Court has ruled in the
Moseneke case to be discriminatory and thus unconstitutional, aspects of
which, sadly, are still on our Statute Book several years after we have
relieved ourselves of these regimes.

In their book entitled A Sourcebook of African Customary Law for Southern
Africa, 1991, published originally as Acta Juridica, Bennett, Devine,
Hutchinson and others interrogate, amongst other things, whether the
African family and women's rights are ``friends or foes''. On page 136 of
the article they state the following, and I quote:


  It is now fairly well documented that what is applied in many African
  countries as customary law is, in Martin Chanock's popular phrase,
  ``neither customary nor law''. In this paper I adopt the view of
  customary law which is influenced by recent accounts of the interaction
  between African custom and colonial rule.

They then proceed to state the following, and I quote:


  These accounts describe the shift from custom to customary law, which
  took place most prominently in the sphere of the family during the
  colonial period in most of Africa, the process consistently involving an
  alliance between the colonial administration and African male elders, the
  latter as the traditional holders of power over strategic resources,
  namely land, cattle, women and children ... They sought to manipulate the
  institutions such as lobola and guardianship. The colonial
  administration, for its part, either misunderstood the nature of African
  institutions or held a view of African society which saw women as
  rightless entities under the authority of men. Whatever their different
  motivations, these forces between them promoted, in the name of
  tradition, the emergence of rigid rules of customary law.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, I do not intend dealing with the details of the
Bill, suffice to say that this ammendment will assist all persons dealing
with intestate estates, no matter what their race, to access the Master's
office via their local designated magistrates' court.

We also share the sentiment that it is shocking that almost nine years into
our new democracy we still have the Black Administration Act on our Statute
Book. Whilst we appreciate that the SA Law Commission is investigating this
Act, in particular to harmonise the customary and common law rules for the
administration of estates, we trust that this Act will be speedily
repealed.

In order to move this process forward, we would urge all stakeholders to
speedily resolve the problems surrounding the customary law of succession
so that the surviving spouse and children are protected, whilst not
abandoning those positive aspects of the customary law of succession.

The case of Mrs Mildred Mtembu and her daughter, who were thrown out of
their home by the father-in-law, highlights the plight of women and
children in customary law matters and should never be allowed to happen
again.

In so far as the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill is concerned, the ACDP
fully supports the proposed amendments. Of particular significance are the
proposals relating to the attorney's profession. As an attorney myself, I
am embarrassed that the profession has been wracked by such a large number
of highly public cases involving the theft of clients' funds, with the Road
Accident Fund fraud being at the forefront.

We trust that the amendments to the Attorneys Act relating to the Fidelity
Fund and the provision of professional indemnity insurance will serve to
better protect the public from unscrupulous legal practitioners. We also
look forward to increased criminal prosecution of such persons.

In conclusion, the ACDP supports these amending Bills. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, there are so many laws and provisions
concerning every sector of concern or aspect of running the country -
common law, statutory law, with constitutional law structuring this
process.

With the entire transition from a colonial state to an apartheid state and
now, proudly a democratic state, changes to legislation have been crucial.
With a diverse and enormous legal system it is not easy for such a
transition to be made. There are many factors to be taken into account, but
the constant testing of laws against the national Constitution is an
important and valuable way of bringing all legislation into line with
current state needs, wants and standards.

The constitutional principles upon which the Constitution has been designed
form the foundation of our society with all legislation being part and
parcel of it. It is worrying that our society is faced with laws that have
not reached the amendment stage, and that we may still be choking on
apartheid laws. This might suggest that the Government still holds to some
discriminatory standard, which is certainly not the case. The public must
be reassured that transition is still happening and that it will not stop
till it has reached every corner and till the law's content has been
brought into line with the South African democracy.

The amendments made to both Bills appear, once again, to bring legislation
into line with democracy and the South African standards that the MF stands
for.

A number of matters are attached to the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill,
but time constraints prevent me from touching on them. The MF, though, is
pleased by the hard work of the Justice department to fill the loopholes in
our judicial system. Now it is hoped that the courts can be made more
secure in holding prisoners, as prisoners breaking out of prison in Cape
Town for the second time is not a good reflection on our system.

The MF supports the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill, and has no reservation
about the amendments made in terms of the administration of estates. We
support the original Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Voorsitter, oor die Judicial Matters Amendment Bill, die
volgende oor een aspek daarvan. Klousule Artikel 3 stel 'n onduidelikheid
reg in die bestaande wetgewing, wat redelike toegang van 'n geskeide ouer
tot sy kinders reël. Die AEB verwelkom hierdie regstelling, wat die reg van
toegang van so 'n ouer bo alle twyfel stel.

Uit ondervinding in die bediening, weet ek dat kinders dikwels deur die
ouer wat toesig het, gebruik word, misbruik word, as speelbal en
strafmaatreël teen die geskeide eggenoot, so half met die verwronge
uitgangspunt van "possession is nine points of the law."

Die AEB steun die uitgangspunt in die Suid Afrikaanse reg dat nie die
twiste van die ouers nie, maar die belang van die kind, die deurslaggewende
faktor moet wees. Ek wil by die behandeling van hierdie wetsontwerp 'n
dringende beroep op geskeide ouers doen: moenie jul kinders die slagveld
maak van jul eie gevegte nie.

En verder: geen wet kan die onverkwiklike situasie van 'n egskeiding en die
posisie van die kinders volkome reël nie. Billikheid en volwassenheid deur
die ouers bly die deurslaggewende faktor. Moenie dat onskuldige kinders die
sweep word waarmee u u gewese man of vrou wil bykom nie. Hulle het nie
daarvoor gevra nie.

Oor die wetsontwerp op boedeladministrasie verwelkom die AEB die reëlings
wat hierdie wetsontwerp wil tref om enersyds die diskriminerende maatreëls
in die bestaande wet, soos deur die Konstitusionele Hof uitgewys, reg te
stel, maar terselfdertyd, deur die toewysing van bestaande
justisiepersoneel tot die kantoor van die Meester, die regsproses van
boedeladministrasie vir almal toeganklik te maak. Sodoende word die vakuum
wat geskep is, deur dié uitspraak ordelik gevul.

Verder doen die AEB 'n beroep op sowel die Regering as op groot finansiële
instellings om gesamentlik 'n bewusmakingsveldtog te loods en eenvoudige,
toeganklike en goedkoop fasiliteite te skep ten einde alle Suid-Afrikaners
aan te moedig en in staat te stel om testamente op te stel. Dit is 'n
basiese reg van elke persoon om self te beskik oor sy eie besittings.
Intestate boedels moet sover moontlik uitgeskakel word.

Die AEB steun albei hierdie wetsontwerpe. (Translation of Afrikaans speech

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, concerning the Judicial Matters Amendment
Bill, just the following about one aspect thereof: Clause 3 removes an
uncertainty in the existing Act which regulates reasonable access of a
divorced parent to his or her children. The AEB welcomes this correction
which puts the right to access of such a parent above all doubt.

I know from experience in the ministry that children are often used, and
abused, as puppets and punitive measures against the former spouse by the
parent who has custody, almost with the distorted point of departure that
possession is nine points of the law.

The AEB supports the point of departure in South African law that not the
disputes of the parents, but the interest of the child should be the
determining factor. In dealing with this Bill I want to make an urgent
appeal to divorced parents: Do not make your children the battlefield of
your own battles.

Furthermore, no Act kan completely regulate the unsavoury situation of a
divorce and the position of the children. Reasonableness and maturity by
the parents remain the determining factor. Don't let innocent children
become the whip with which you try to get at your former spouse. They did
not ask for that.

Concerning the Administration of Estates Amendment Bill, the AEB welcomes
the regulations that this Bill seeks to implement, on the one hand to
rectify the discriminatory measures in the existing Act, as pointed out by
the Constitutional Court, but at the same time by making the judiciary
process of estates administration accessible to everyone by the allocation
of existing justice personnel to the office of the Master. Thus the vacuum
which has been created by the verdict will be filled orderly.

Furthermore the AEB calls upon the Government as well as large financial
institutions to launch a joint awareness campaign and establish simple,
accessible and cheap facilities in order to encourage and enable all South
Africans to draw up wills. It is a basic right of every person to dispose
of his or her own possessions. Intestate estates should be eliminated as
far as possible.

The AEB supports both these Bills.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Chairperson, the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill makes
provision for various divergent issues; they are totally unrelated to each
other. However, as the name indicates, the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill
intends to amend various procedural, and to a certain extent, make
substantive changes to the South African law. For instance, the name of the
SA Law Commission is amended to read the SA Law Reform Commission - one of
the more formalistic amendments.

Van belang, is die wysiging van Artikel 1 van die Algemene Regswysigingswet
van 1962 ten einde voorsiening te maak dat 'n ouer aan wie beheer en toesig
oor 'n minderjarige kind toegestaan is, ingevolge 'n hofbevel, hetsy hy of
sy alleen of gesamentlike beheer en toesig toegestaan is, skuldig is aan 'n
oortreding indien die een ouer die ander ouer toegang tot die minderjarige
kind weier - 'n aspek wat die Demokratiese Party steun. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Of importance is the amendment to Section 1 of the General Law Amendment
Bill of 1962 to make provision for a parent to whom control and custody of
a minor child was awarded in accordance with a court order, regardless of
whether it is joint or sole custody, to be guilty of an offence if the one
parent refuses the other access to the minor child. This is something which
the Democratic Party supports.]

Of more importance is the insertion of a clause in the Attorneys Act of
1979 which allows the board of control of the Fidelity Fund to enter into a
contract with a company carrying on professional indemnity insurance
business for the provision of group professional indemnity insurance to
practitioners.
Provision is also made for every attorney to pay an amount annually in
respect of the cost of group professional indemnity insurance. It is,
however, still doubtful whether full cover is provided to those members of
the public who, from time to time, are negatively affected by the lack of
professionalism by attorneys in the execution of their duties towards their
clients as members of the public.

It is our view, judging from numerous complaints received from the public,
that this matter should be investigated by the Department of Justice and
Constitutional Development in order to establish whether the Fidelity Fund,
in fact, fulfils its role as indemnity insurance for the provision of group
professional insurance to practitioners in order to ultimately benefit the
public.

The DA also welcomes the application of the Attorneys Act of 1979
throughout the country by repealing the apartheid-originated Attorneys,
Notaries and Conveyancers Admission Acts as applicable in the former
Transkei and the former Bophuthatswana in order to alleviate numerous
problems, evidently flowing form their reincorporation.

Vanweë die noodsaaklike aard van die wysiginge voorgestel, steun die DP
hierdie wetsontwerp. [In view of the necessary nature of the proposed
amendment, the DP supports this Bill.]

Mr J H JEFFERY: Chairperson, as the Deputy Minister said right at the start
of the debate these are technical Bills, and during the inputs from the
different speakers a number of provisions have been highlighted.

Most of the speakers have focused correctly so on the Administration of
Estates Amendment Bill, correctly so because it repeals a discriminatory
provision on our Statute Book. I think it will also, though, be of benefit
to everybody in that access to the magistrates' office for the
administration of estates will then be easier for everybody in the country.

I wanted, really, to highlight some provisions of the Judicial Matters
Amendment Bill, in particular, as the previous speaker highlighted, is the
change of name of the SA Law Commission to the SA Law Reform Commission.

There is also a provision for an opportunity for the President to appoint
two additional members of that commission. It is hoped that these
additional people will assist the Law Commission, or the Law Reform
Commission, as it will be known, with the workload that it faces in order
to assist it in fulfilling its duties.

I think the most important provision of the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill
is the amendment to the Attorneys Act which, hopefully, should result in
greater protection for the public when there are problems with attorneys
that members of the public have gone to.

Lastly, there was, as is contained in our report, a clause relating to
problems that attorneys and candidate attorneys from the former Transkei
and Bophuthatswana faced that was to be included in this Bill and that was
taken out by the committee. As our report states, the measures in this
clause were intended to be of an interim nature pending the enactment of
the Legal Practice Bill.

However, because of presentations, it would appear as though the matter is
not as straightforward as originally thought. The committee has therefore
requested the department, in its report to this House, to have further
consultations and revert back to the committee in February of next year. It
is hoped then that we can address that further outstanding issue, which is
also a legacy of our past. With those words, I support the Bill.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, I would like to thank all the opposition parties for their
support of the Bill. I do recognise the importance of the concerns that
they expressed in terms of the pace of the work of the SA Law Commission,
or the SA Law Reform Commission as it will soon be known. The Minister has
also expressed concern about this.

I do need to point out that this is not a case of nothing having been done.
In fact, nearly all the aspects of the justice part of the Black
Administration Act have been dealt with to the extent that they can be. In
fact, the Minister responded to the committee's recommendation exactly a
month after it was given, by calling upon the SA Law Commission to
investigate the matter of customary estates.

Quite clearly, we are caught in a catch-22 situation. The issue of
customary estates has to be dealt with before we can get rid of the other
provisions in this ghastly piece of legislation that still hangs over our
heads. Let me just say that the attention of the other departments has been
drawn to this matter.

However, what happens is that there are also huge provincial implications.
Many portions of the Act also have implications within the provinces, and
these vary from province to province. It is an extremely complicated reform
process, but the criticisms around the pace are fully appreciated.

I would just like to say that the comments will be taken seriously and will
be taken back to the Minister. I would also just like to refer to the issue
around children and the comment by the hon Aucamp of children not being the
battleground of two parents. I am going to take an irregular opportunity
here to remind all those parents who default on maintenance payments that
this is another area in which children suffer - when the battle between
parents is not kept in the purview of the parents and the impact is on the
children.

Maintenance is not about two adults; it is, in fact, about the children. I
would appeal to all of us to make sure that the people we know, and the
people that are our brothers and sisters and fathers and sons, pay their
maintenance - an irregular use of the podium, but this is a very important
message.

Obviously, the comments related to the profession were appreciated.
Everybody is unanimously in support of the Bill. It clearly is a step
forward and we, too, in the Ministry look forward to getting rid of this
ghastly piece of apartheid legislation that hangs over our heads as a sorry
reminder of a sad past. [Applause.]

   (Consideration of Report of Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local
                             Government thereon)

Report adopted without debate.

                    LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)
An HON MEMBER: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Igama
lamakhosikazi! [The name of women!]

Chairperson, hon members, the process of local government transformation
has been proceeding steadily and systematically, and has been in accordance
with the overarching plan that was set in motion by the Local Government
Transition Act of 1993. This plan envisaged three phases, namely the
preinterim phase, the interim phase and the final phase. We are now in the
final phase, which started on 5 December in the year 2000.

The final phase itself unfolds in three stages. The first stage - the
establishment stage - is expected to be completed by the end of this year,
which entails a formal amalgamation and development of the new local
government structures.

The second stage, which starts at the end of this year, is set to address
consolidation and stabilisation of the local government dispensation, and
this stage will run until the year 2005. This will require a concerted
effort by all three spheres of government to attend to the full
implementation of the systems and practices of local government. It goes
without saying, therefore, that capacity-building efforts will have to be
intensified.

The last and third stage in this phase is to ensure sustainability in local
government, and this stage is envisaged to take effect from 2005 and to
reach its peak in the year 2010. As hon members can see, we have come a
long way in South Africa on a course to completely restructure the system
of local government.

The new local government dispensation was heralded by the successful
elections in 2000. The start of this new dispensation can be compared to
the birth of a baby; and just as a newborn baby must be nurtured and will
experience growing pains, so too the new local government system must be
nurtured and will experience growing pains. It is some of these growing
pains that the Local Government Laws Amendment Bill seeks to address.

The establishment stage that I referred to earlier highlighted the need to
further refine the legal framework applicable to local government, and, to
this end, the Bill seeks to amend the Organised Local Government Act of
1997, the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers Act of 1998, the Local
Government: Municipal Demarcation Act of 1998, the Local Government:
Municipal Structures Act of 1998, the Local Government: Municipal Systems
Act of 2000 and the Local Government: Municipal Structures Amendment Act of
2000.

This Bill is intended to address the anomalies in the current legislation
in order to create certainty. A number of these amendments are of a
technical nature, whilst the rest of the amendments seek to clarify and to
restate policy. The latter were informed by the practical realities that
are being experienced on a daily basis by councillors and local government
practitioners.

The process of transforming local government presents numerous challenges.
It can be expected that from time to time similar legislative interventions
may be necessary. It should be noted that our system of local government is
widely recognised as a model for best practices as far as local government
is concerned. This was confirmed during deliberations at the WSSD local
government session. It follows, therefore, that our attempts to confront
the challenges rising from the implementation of our local government
system should be seen as giving direction to the international community
for further improvement of local government models.

In conclusion, let me assure the House that the Ministry and the Department
of Provincial and Local Government have taken note of the concerns raised
by the portfolio committee in its report regarding the late introduction of
the Bill to Parliament. This is regretted.

The Ministry and the department further note the concerns raised in the
committee's report regarding the transgression of the Remuneration of
Public Office Bearers Act, the repeal of relevant provisions of the
provincial ordinances and the expediting of the Property Rates Bill. We
undertake to attend to these matters expeditiously.

We would like to thank the portfolio committee for their meticulous
processing of this Bill despite the limited time afforded them. Our thanks
also go to the departmental team that developed and processed the Bill, and
to the stakeholders who submitted constructive inputs.

In commending this Bill to this House for discussion, may I remind members
as well as the nation of the words of the then chairperson of the White
Paper on Local Government Political Committee, Comrade Pravin Gordan, who
said in the foreword of the White Paper:


  Actually implementing the policies contained in this paper will take a
  supreme effort, tremendous resilience and constructive participation of
  all role-players. It will require our participation and rolling up of
  sleeves, our acting like citizens, as opposed to mere atomised consumers
  of municipal services. It will require very specific commitment and
  effort from national and provincial government and, not in the least,
  from councillors and the administrators within local government.

May I say that we believe that the intention of this piece of legislation
is to assist in facilitating the smooth implementation of our new local
government system. In following this route, we are sure to overcome the
challenges that confront us from time to time on the road to a transformed
system of local government. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon members on my left are
transacting personal business instead of national business. Could I please
call you, hon members, to order.

Mrs G M BORMAN: Chairperson, there were some aspects of this Bill that
needed extensive consultation, and the haste with which we have had to ram
it through Parliament is quite unacceptable. I am pleased that the Deputy
Minister has referred to that and, also, it has been acknowledged in the
portfolio committee's report on the Bill.

In the time available I will confine myself to just three aspects. Clause
20 of this Bill seeks to amend the Local Government: Municipal Structures
Act in order to validate the Property Valuation Ordinance of 1993 in the
Cape. This affects municipalities in the Western, Eastern and Northern Cape
provinces.

The Cape Town Unicity is a case in point. Valuations, which are essential
to the revenue of municipalities, were last done in 1979. Cape Town did its
valuations on the basis of an old ordinance, because the proposed Property
Rates Bill, which has been promised for years, just did not materialise. I
ask the hon the Deputy Minister: How long are we going to have to wait for
this Bill? Is it until we have more court cases and total chaos in our
municipalities? That aside, it would seem that the amendment is a technical
one, and the DA supports it.

Clause 43 in this Bill, amending section 118 of the Local Government:
Municipal Systems Act, is also of concern. When owners of properties
occupied by tenants come to sell their properties, they sometimes find that
the tenants have run up huge service charge backlogs. The owner cannot be
responsible for something he has not contracted into. If the contract is
between the municipality and the tenant, the tenant must pay. If the
contract is between the municipality and the owner, then the owner must
pay.

There are currently court cases pending in which arrears of R12 000 and R1
million for electricity have been allowed to mount up, because the
municipality's credit control is slack. Who pays? It is not the tenant, nor
the municipality that has allowed the debt to run up, but the property
owner who wants to sell his property. He can only sell his property when
the municipality has issued a clearance certificate stating that all
arrears for the past two years have been paid. This is unjust. It is
unfair. This legislation fails to address this very real anomaly, and I
submit that it needs to be amended to cover the property owners in the
cases I have referred to. For this reason, the DA cannot support clause 43.

Clause 44 of the Bill amends schedule 1 to the Local Government: Municipal
Systems Act, which says that ``a councillor may not be in arrears to the
municipality for rates and service charges for a period longer than three
months''. Needless to say, the DA fully supports this amendment, but asks
what action will be taken against defaulting councillors. Public
representatives should be expected to set an example for the citizens that
they represent.

With the exception of clause 43, the DA supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr Y I CARRIM: Mr Chairperson, comrades and friends, this Bill, as
explained by the Deputy Minister, deals mainly with minor technical
amendments to six pieces of local government legislation to ensure their
proper implementation.

These amendments make it clear that the core principles and values of the
new local government system are essentially sound. What is called for is
the more effective implementation of the new model. For this, all of us
have a responsibility. It is a responsibility that we must fulfil with much
greater determination.

The main substantive issue addressed in the Bill is the extension of the
transitional period for MECs' authorisations of the division of powers and
functions between district and local municipalities from 5 December this
year to 30 June 2003.

As the House is aware, district and local municipalities share powers and
functions. These have to be divided between them. The Minister, after
appropriate consultation, decides on this division in respect of water,
sanitation, electricity and health. The local government MECs decide on the
division of all the other powers and functions on the basis of the capacity
of municipalities, as assessed by the Municipal Demarcation Board.

On the eve of December 2000, when the local government elections were being
held, it was decided to retain the status quo in respect of the division of
powers and functions for a two-year period, and to change it thereafter.
This period lapses on 5 December 2002. The six-month extension is necessary
mainly to give stakeholders more time to prepare, and to ensure that the
coming into effect of the new allocation of powers and functions coincides
with the beginning of the municipal financial year and that it is property
budgeted for.

As conveyed in our report to Parliament, the committee feels that
consideration must be given to the following. Firstly, there should be
alignment of the publication of the notices of the Minister's
authorisations of the four national powers and functions and the MECs'
publication of the notices of the adjustments of the remaining powers and
functions must take place. The publication of these notices must take place
by no later than the end of January 2003 in order to give municipalities
adequate time to prepare and to budget accordingly.

Secondly, there must be alignment, over time, of the Minister's
authorisations of powers and functions and the MECs' adjustments of the
powers and functions. Thirdly, the Minister's authorisations and the MECs'
adjustments should be reviewed over time to ensure that the important role
allocated to district municipalities, both in legislation and policy, is
fulfilled.

The Bill also deals with technical amendments relating to the Cape
Valuation Ordinance, as the hon Borman explained. Related to this issue is
the dispute between the Cape Town metropolitan municipality and a section
of its ratepayers. It is regrettable that a section of the ratepayers is
exploiting an unfortunate technical loophole as the basis for their legal
action against the Cape Town municipality to address their concerns over
the current equitable valuations and rates policy of Cape Town.

While it is right for the parties to the dispute to pursue legal action,
the committee feels that all the parties to the dispute should seek to
resolve their differences through discussions and negotiations. The
committee feels, moreover, that these ratepayers' concerns with the current
equitable valuations and the rates policy might be more usefully served by
engaging with the municipality on the current valuations and rates policy.

Aggrieved parties, it is felt by the committee, should also utilise
appropriate objection and appeal procedures more effectively. If the effect
of the current valuations results in undue financial burdens on any
category of ratepayers, the municipality needs to explore, through its
rates policy, whether there is anything it can do to provide appropriate
relief to these ratepayers.

Many of the basic political issues underlying the dispute will be addressed
in the pending Property Rates Bill ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, hon members! I appeal
to you in that I think you are now really becoming too rowdy. This is
making it difficult for Mr Carrim, who is now trying to speak at the top of
his voice, to be heard. Please show him and the other speakers who will be
following him respect.

Mr Y I CARRIM: I just want to go on to say that all stakeholders will be
given a full opportunity to participate in shaping the new property rates
dispensation when the Property Rates Bill comes before us.

I agree that the Property Rates Bill should be brought to Parliament
expeditiously, but I think it is important that the department and the
Ministry consult the various stakeholders. It is not true that we have this
problem just because the Property Rates Bill has not been brought to
Parliament, as Mrs Borman suggested.

In fact, there is a problem with the fact that on 27 April 1994, when the
Constitution adopted all existing legislation, this Cape Valuation
Ordinance was not in effect. It came into effect on 1 July 1994. This three-
month gap explains why we have the current problems that we have.
Hopefully, this Bill will redress that.

Finally, I want to say that in processing the clause dealing with the
remuneration of councillors, the committee noted that municipalities are
providing allowances and benefits to councillors in contravention of the
Remuneration of Public Office Bearers Act. They do so, in fact, in terms of
the provisions in provincial ordinances, but these provincial ordinances
have no legal effect since the enactment of the remuneration Act.

The committee recognises that councillors' salaries and allowances need to
be adequate, but the dissatisfaction of municipalities around this should
be negotiated through the appropriate channels. The present practice of
transgressing the remuneration Act is wholly unacceptable. The Ministry and
department should discuss this with Salga and other appropriate
stakeholders.

The committee feels that, firstly, the Ministry and department should take
active steps to stop this practice. Secondly, the MECs for local government
should act more decisively against these transgressions. Thirdly, the
Ministry and department should seek to have the relevant provisions of the
provincial ordinances repealed. These matters, we believe, can be amicably
addressed through sensitive negotiations involving all the stakeholders.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! UDM members, I have been
requesting compliance; it is in that area that you are continuing to defy
the request by the Chair. Could I please call you to order? You may now
continue, Mr Carrim.

Mr Y I CARRIM: Chairperson, I am about to finish. I just want to say,
finally, that we would like to convey our thanks to the Ministry and the
department, in particular to Jackie Manche, and Petra Bouwer who is here
and who is, as usual, enormously helpful and co-operative and extremely
hardworking. Thanks also go to Adv Khulong, who is not here; and my warmest
thanks go to Chris Sibanyoni, the researcher attached to our committee if
only for 25% of his time, but we, nevertheless, express our deepest thanks
to him. [Applause.]

Mr P F SMITH: Chairperson, colleagues, in supporting this Bill I would like
to make three points. The first relates to process matters. This Bill is
brought to us as a fast-track item. There is a national crisis and this
Bill, with its 48 clauses, must go through.

One had anticipated piles of urgent matters in it, but in reality there
were two clauses out of the 46 - maybe three at a stretch - that were
vaguely important and that had to be processed this year. The rest should,
really, have been held over till next year. Although we did deal with the
matter expeditiously, I really think, as a matter of principle, that the
executive needs to know that we do not approve of this kind of behaviour.
We think the committee should have rejected all the other clauses forcing
them to reappear next year before us.

However, be that as it may, that is a process matter, and two of the issues
were important. I am pleased to say that we agree with the content of those
and that they have been processed adequately.

As far as the two substantive issues are concerned, the first relates to
the extension of the transition from the end of this year to the end of
June. The reason being that one cannot now, in midstream, have an
adjustment of powers and functions of municipalities without causing chaos,
particularly with regard to their budget cycle. They are now in the middle
of a budget cycle, and to expect 284 municipalities to start readjusting
their budgets as of consequence of readjusted powers and functions is not
realistic. Therefore we approve of that.

However, we are of the view that in granting the extension we really should
have put in this legislation that a fixed commitment be made by the MECs in
law - meaning that we would have written into the law an obligation on them
to resolve this matter timeously and to publish their determinations in
January, so that everybody would know where they stood come the budget
process.

We were led to believe by the department that this would not be necessary;
they gave their word that it would all be done timeously and to that their
reassurance should be taken for what it is. We will hold them to that. We
will see, in January, whether it is all done in time, but we really urge
that this is done timeously, because if it is not done in time we will have
further chaos down the road as municipalities engage in budget processes
not knowing what their powers and functions are going to be.

Finally, there is this matter of the rates issue. The fact of the matter is
that there is no rates law governing the collection and levying of rates in
three provinces in this country. That is not simply an anomaly, but a
rather serious crisis if someone were to go to court to seek to have the
basis upon which they are being rated nullified by law. This is, of course,
precisely what is happening in Cape Town, where there is a rates action
group and a couple of ratepayers who are taking the City of Cape Town to
court on the basis that there is no law governing their being rated.

Now we had a bit of a problem, because the Bill that we are amending is
retrospective in effect. This is, first of all, to validate the provincial
ordinance in terms of which all these municipalities in the three provinces
have, in fact, been levying their rates. Secondly, this Bill is
retrospective to take care of this pending litigation.

I must say that retrospective legislation is problematic in any event, but
to do so in respect of pending litigation, which has the effect of
nullifying the applicants' case, is more problematic.

However, we had to weigh that up against whatever is the lesser of two
evils. Ultimately, it is more important that we save a potential crisis in
terms of rates legislation - this vacuum or lacuna - than that we satisfy
the applicants before the court.

We must add, of course, that the basis of the evidence that they will be
using in court was not, in fact, discovered by them. It was provided to
this Parliament by Cape Town and by the Western Cape government, who simply
lacked the legal competence to resolve the matter. So, had the applicants
themselves discovered all the information and on that basis we were
nullifying it, this may have been more problematic. However, given the fact
that they are simply piggybacking on information that was already in the
public domain this is less important.

We would also like to say that it is very important to note that although
some of the issues raised by the applicants - not in their court case - in
their submissions to us are valid in terms of perhaps consultation,
unhappiness with certain elements of the rating policy and so forth, it
really is not the purpose of this legislature to accept that they can use
this lacuna in the law as ``a stick to beat the municipality with'' which
is, in fact, to quote their own words. We would urge that they negotiate
their problems with the municipality in question. The chair of the
committee and the committee itself have offered to help mediate in this
matter and we hope they take it up.

We are pleased to support the Bill. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon Mr W P Doman returns
to this Chamber, but this is nonetheless his maiden speech.

Mr W P DOMAN: Chairperson, my first sitting day as a member of Parliament
was on 2 February 1990, when Mr F W de Klerk delivered his speech about
transforming South Africa into a democracy. So I am always happy to say
that since I entered politics, things started to change for the better.

In my maiden speech later that year I made the plea that all South
Africans, but especially leaders at all levels, should sharpen their
negotiation skills and emphasise that an attitude of give-and-take should
be internalised because that is the very essence of negotiation.

I am very happy to say that through such an attitude a win-win situation
has, to a very large extent, prevailed in South Africa over the past
decade. This was also evident in the committee which dealt with this Bill
with its 49 clauses. The New NP supports this Bill.

Met klousule 34 het dit om verskeie redes nodig geword om 'n definisie te
gee van wat 'n munisipale diens is. Die komitee kon uiteindelik nie 'n eng
definisie gee nie, maar moes rekening hou met die feit dat munisipaliteite
se rolle verander het van 'n diensorganisasie wat 'n paar kerndienste met
eie personeel en bronne lewer na 'n ontwikkelingsgerigte liggaam wat
markgerig alle hulpbronne moet benut. Uit die Wet op Plaaslike Regering,
Munisipale Stelsels, 2000, blyk dit duidelik dat ontwikkeling, nie
regulering nie, die sleutelrol is wat munisipaliteite nou moet vertolk.

Gevolglik het ons vandag raadslede nodig wat soos entrepreneurs moet dink
en wat nie daarop ingestel moet wees om alles en almal in hul
jurisdiksiegebied te reguleer nie. Hulle moet nou vra watter potensiaal lê
opgesluit in ons munisipale gebied wat volhoudend ontwikkel kan word met
die doel om, soos die stelselwet sê, die lewensgehalte van almal te
verbeter. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[With clause 34 it has for a variety of reasons become necessary to give a
definition of what a municipal service is. In the end the committee could
not give a narrow definition, but they had to take into consideration the
fact that the role of municipalities changed from being a service
organisation with a few core services with its own personnel and resources,
to an organisation geared towards development and being market-orientated
in order to utilise all resources. In accordance with the Local Government:
Municipal System Act, 2000, it seems clear that development, and not
regulation, is the key role that municipalities should play.

Consequently we need councillors today who should think like entrepreneurs
and not be focused on regulating everything and anything in their
jurisdiction. They should now ask what potential lies within our
municipalities that must be developed on a continuous basis with the aim,
as the system Act stipulates, of improving the quality of life of
everyone.]

This also challenges Parliament and the provincial legislatures to create
the legislative framework which can serve as instruments with which
municipalities can fulfil their developmental tasks. We should not
overregulate, and when we legislate we should allow for municipalities to
render effective services as cheaply as possible to compete in the private
sector for money and investments and to really develop their communities in
an integrated way.

The whole concept of reinventing government, which was coined in relation
to local government in the USA by Ted Gabler and others, is starting to
take root in local government in South Africa. Its simple message is: More
laws will not solve problems; allow for human initiative to do that.
[Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, I am not a member of the portfolio committee.
However, I wish to refer to the amendment in clause 43. Section 118(3) of
the original Act, the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, Act 32 of
2000, states that an amount due for municipal service fees, surcharges on
fees, property rates and other municipal taxes, levies and duties is a
charge upon the property in connection with which the amount is owing and
enjoys preference over any mortgage bond registered against the property.

The problem here, I believe, is that this particular provision is
discriminatory and unfair. What happens here is that when the owner of the
property wishes to dispose of it, that owner is called upon to make good
whatever amounts are owed by tenants of that particular property. In many
instances the local authority has no credit control system, in spite of the
fact that the above Act provides clearly that they should have a policy in
place.

In instances like these, where the local authority has failed to collect
service charges from tenants and where the owner of the property is not
informed as to who the tenant is that he is seeking to connect up with, it
is unfair to then expect the owner to make good because the local authority
has failed. To my mind that is a principle that cannot be supported.

I want to appeal to the hon the Deputy Minister to look at this aspect very
seriously, so that we can bring about an obligation on local authorities to
keep the owners of properties informed when their tenants are not meeting
their commitments.

Furthermore, there is another anomaly ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member, unfortunately your
time has expired.

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, can I not have some injury time? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I gave you a few seconds, but you
were starting on a new point.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon members and chairperson of the portfolio
committee, as hon members know, Mrs Southgate, who is a member of this
committee, raised quite a lot of issues during the debate on this amending
Bill. I would like to repeat the concerns raised by her.

First and foremost, the validity of the Cape Property Valuation Ordinance
is at present being challenged in court. Secondly, whilst we appreciate
that the consequence of a successful challenge would be the repayment of
rates already paid, we are concerned regarding the constitutionality of
retrospective legislation, particularly where it knocks out the court case
in the Cape.

We, consequently, have reservations about supporting the amendment to
section 93 of the Local Government: Municipal Structures Act, and for these
reasons the ACDP will abstain from voting for or against this Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the light is flickering before I have even
started.

One of the greatest features of South Africa's democracy is the separation
of powers that are curtailed by the national Constitution in chapter 3 on
co-operative government. The division between national, provincial and
local government has worked out well. The backlog and the impersonalisation
of centralised government have been much relieved by this democratic
process.

It has, however, not been a very easy process and many times it has
resulted in conflict, but we have managed to work things out. That is what
co-operative government is all about. The differences that arise in debate
are healthy. As a representative Government, these differences are as a
result of the will of our people, and it is the Government's task to work
out strategies to the satisfaction, protection and best interests of each
citizen and South Africa as a whole.

Local government, though separate, is felt to have curtailed powers, but
this is not so. Within our three-tier system, power and authority are
shared from level to level. A local government area belongs in the
provincial arena which, in turn, belongs in the national arena. We are all
interrelated and these spheres help to sift through and magnify the needs
of our community.

The MF supports the Local Government Laws Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Rev A D GOOSEN: Chair, one of the objectives of our portfolio committee is
to advance the implementation of the new system of local government. We
have thus far pursued this goal with great vigour and determination. So, in
spite of differences we may have in the committee, we nevertheless share a
common interest. It is thus in working as a unit that we can strive to make
the new system work.

A great deal of time is spent in processing legislation consensually. The
chair, especially, tries his utmost to get everybody on board. Should a
person have a problem with any particular clause in a Bill, no effort is
spared in trying to resolve the issue amicably.

The ACDP is abstaining from voting on the Bill just because they have a
problem with clause 20. Throughout the proceedings, the hon Rhoda did not
indicate that she was opposed to clause 20. Then, suddenly, on the day of
the vote, she opposes the Bill. As a Whip she does not even know that you
can oppose a clause in a Bill while supporting the Bill as a whole.

She was very confused - an MP from another party had to help her to make
sense of what she was saying. The hon Rhoda's opposition to the Bill had
absolutely nothing to do with the Bill itself; it was purely political
opportunism. The Bill contains mostly technical amendments, and the
substantive issues are not politically motivated. Now, maybe her
researcher, or somebody else, helped her to understand why she had to
oppose the Bill.

As for the hon Southgate, I would say that she should stop her holier-than-
thou attitude, which is so often displayed in this House and which does not
augur well for good relationships. I would suggest that she be less self-
righteous and reveal a spirit of humility.

I suppose the ACDP opposes clause 20 mainly because they want to protect
the privileges of rich ratepayers in Cape Town. May I just add one or two
points here by saying that prior to 1998, the MECs were responsible for
determining the allowances of councillors, but when the Remuneration of
Public Office Bearers Act of 1998 came into being, the MECs could no longer
do the determining. So, when both the MECs for Gauteng and the Western
Province sent out circulars determining the allowances in the 1998-99
financial year, this was not consistent with the Act.

The clause pertaining to the validation of the Cape Property Valuation
Ordinance has a bearing on the dispute which ratepayers have with the Cape
Town metro. The committee has empathy for those who are detrimentally
affected by huge increases in rates in certain areas, especially those who
are residing along the Atlantic seaboard.

But while we would urge the aggrieved parties to enter into negotiations
with the Cape Town metro, we also appreciate that, through the recent
valuations, the playing fields have been levelled to suit all areas. Until
now, it has been the ratepayers in the lower income groups and areas who
have been paying higher rates and subsidising the rich.

I would say that the ACDP is opposing clause 20 mainly to protect the
privileges of rich ratepayers on the Atlantic seaboard. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chair, I would
like to thank each and every member who participated in this debate. I know
it was not a very exciting debate today, but I thank them very much for
their contributions and for clarifying for the other members, who were
speakers here today, what this Bill is about, particularly for speakers
like the hon Mr Green, who simply did not understand the message from the
hon Southgate. It is a pity that he is abstaining from voting and not
supporting this Bill. Nevertheless, I say thank you very much.

Again, may I repeat, this Bill is mainly a technical matter. It is not, as
people want to make it out to be, a matter that is talking about the
valuation, as the hon Borman was saying. Incidentally, the hon Borman is a
member of the committee and in the committee report the hon Borman agreed
that the Property Rates Bill should be introduced in Parliament next year,
but when she comes to the podium she posed ...

Mrs G M BORMAN: I did not.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Excuse me. But
when she comes to the podium she wants to know from me when this Property
Rates Bill will be introduced when, in fact, they have agreed that it will
be introduced next year. [Interjections.]

The hon Borman was stating that the amendment creates undue ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, hon Deputy Minister, if
you will just take your seat.

Hon member, are you rising on a point of order?
Ms G M BORMAN: Yes, I am rising on a point of order, Chairperson. The
Deputy Minister is misleading this House. She has been given incorrect
information ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, that is not a point of
order. [Interjections.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: It is a point of order, Chairperson, because she is
misleading the House. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That is not a point of order. Hon
member, will you indicate what the issue is on which the Deputy Minister is
misleading the House. [Interjections.] Hon Borman, what is the issue?

Mrs G M BORMAN: Chairperson, she is misquoting from a report that was
tabled in the committee, because in the report I actually spoke about the
urgency, and corrected what they spoke about as being a reasonable need to
bring this before Parliament. I corrected that and said that I thought
there needed to be an urgency about this. So there is incorrect information
here.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Again, hon member, the issue
that you are raising could be one of perception; it is not a hard fact on
which you are raising a point. If you have a substantive argument that the
Deputy Minister is knowingly and willingly misleading the House, well, that
is an issue on which you can rise. Yes, hon Ken Andrew?

Mr K M ANDREW: Chair, surely, with respect, this is not simply a question
of debate, it is a question of parliamentary documents that are actually
tabled and distributed in Parliament. Now, in the past, there was a
convention, which has now fallen away, in which if you were going to quote
from such a document, you, in fact, had to give the reference so that other
members could check whether you were quoting correctly or not. It is not
simply an issue of a matter of opinion or what somebody said or did not
say, it is what is in a document, that is an official parliamentary report
from a committee.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Ken Andrew, again, from the
perspective of the Chair: How is the Chair required to uphold the veracity
of a statement being made by either member? The only way in which this can
be done is via a substantive motion, because the Chair can only judge on
the basis of the information that is in front of the Chair, and the Chair
at the moment does not have the document that you are referring to.
Therefore, I cannot uphold the point of order that you are raising.

Mr K M ANDREW: Chair, I accept your dilemma and the problem, but I would
suggest that given the fact that there is a dispute of fact on a
parliamentary document, a written report from a committee, one request the
speaker - not the Speaker in the sense of yourself, but the hon Deputy
Minister on this occasion - to actually refer to what part of the report
she is quoting from so that it can be checked whether or not she is
misleading the House. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Andrew, again, I think  you
raise an issue about a pointed reference made by the  Deputy  Minister,  and
then you want me from the Chair to be able  to  give  a  ruling  as  to  the
validity or the nonvalidity  of  that.  This  is  impossible.  Therefore,  I
revert again to my original ruling, which is that  it  is  not  a  point  of
order and if you do  wish  to  raise  a  point  of  order,  please  bring  a
substantive motion in order that we can be referred to the  actual  document
and to the actual statement of the Deputy Minister so that the  veracity  or
otherwise of the point can be interpreted. [Interjections.]
Hon Deputy Minister, you may continue.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson,
coming back to the third Order of the Day, we considered the portfolio
committee report. The last point in the report states that he committee
feels that the negotiations with the relevant stakeholders of the Property
Rates Bill should be completed reasonably soon, and that that Bill should
be introduced in Parliament next year.
My question is: Why is the hon Borman asking me when the Property Rates
Bill will be introduced, when it is clearly stated in this report, which we
considered today? [Interjections.] I just want to prove that those hon
members are arguing over nothing. [Interjections.] They are arguing over
nothing.

I would also like to make the point that the hon Borman, in respect of the
amendment to section 118, is incorrect in stating that the amendment
creates undue hardship for home owners, because this is already law and the
amendment does two things: it creates certainty in respect of the duration
of the validity of the clearance certificate, and it makes special
provision for first-time home owners who receive houses from the state.

I just want, again, to thank very much all those who participated in the
debate. It is a pity that DP members always try to oppose even when there
is no need to. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
Bill read a second time.
