ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

Mr D A HANEKOM: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President George Bush and President Thabo Mbeki will  take
       the centre stage  at  the  opening  of  the  United  Nations  General
       Assembly;


  (2) further notes that President Mbeki will use this opportunity to  urge
       extreme caution in respect of the dangers associated with the planned
       attack of Iraq;


  (3) believes that such unilateral moves would pose a  serious  threat  to
       world peace  and  security  and  will  exacerbate  turmoil  in  world
       markets,  deepen  levels  of  poverty  and   could   result   in   an
       unprecedented increase in terrorist activities; and


  (4) calls on President George  Bush  and  British  Prime  Minister,  Tony
       Blair, to desist from unilateral militaristic approaches  and  state-
       sponsored terrorism against other nations.

[Applause.]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes a recent decision by the Supreme Court of Appeals that  tenants
       who default on  rental  payments  and  buyers  who  default  on  bond
       payments will be protected against eviction;


  (2) believes that this ruling -


       (a)  does not comply with the intentions of Act 19 of 1998 which  are
           to protect both the landlord and the tenant; and


       (b)  will have a negative effect on the property market as well as on
           the   availability   of   rental   accommodation,   particularly
           accommodation for poorer people; and


  (3) therefore calls  on  the  Minister  of  Housing  to  investigate  the
       implications of this judgment as a matter of urgency.

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness that  a  19-year-old  man,  whom  members  of  the
       community believed to be guilty of housebreaking, was beaten to death
       in Phillipi;


  (2) further notes that he is  just  one  of  several  victims  of  street
       justice in the Cape Peninsula over the last few days; and


  (3) urges members of the communities not to take the law into  their  own
       hands, but to inform the police if they  suspect  that  a  person  is
       guilty of any crime.

Mr P J GOMOMO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has come under
       pressure from his country to explain Britain's  imminent  involvement
       in a war on Iraq;


  (2) further notes reports that the United States Congress is  unconvinced
       of the need to embark on a war against Iraq;

[Interjections.]


  (3) believes that this reflects a strong view that war will undermine the
       rights of the people of Iraq and will lead  to  unnecessary  loss  of
       life and destruction of property;

[Interjections.]


  (4) further believes that the  United  Nations  is  the  only  legitimate
       structure which can  determine  whether  Iraq  has  weapons  of  mass
       destruction; and


  (5) echoes the voice of the people and political representatives  in  the
       United States and in Britain who are opposed to a military  onslaught
       against the people of Iraq.

[Applause.]

Mr C B HERANDIEN: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the New NP welcomes and supports the Minister of Housing's
       quick response in seeking legal  advice  on  possible  Constitutional
       Court action following the recent ruling of the Appeal Court  on  the
       interpretation  of  the  Security  of  Tenure  Act  as  well  as  the
       Prevention of Illegal Evictions and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act;


  (2) further notes  that  in  the  light  of  the  New  NP's  constructive
       engagement with Government, the New NP asked the Portfolio  Committee
       on Housing to acknowledge our human rights with regard to housing but
       also to -


       (a)  protect the property rights of investors;


       (b)  protect the rights of financial institutions;


       (c)  protect the rights of estate and letting agents; and


       (d)  protect the rights of  tenants  who  will  have  to  pay  larger
           deposits and higher rent; and


  (3) also notes that the New NP urges  the  Minister  to  deal  with  this
       matter in an amicable way, by  revising  the  Act,  as  South  Africa
       cannot afford uncertainty in the housing market.

[Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes media reports of the intention of  US  President  George  Bush,
       echoed by Tony Blair, to attack the state of Iraq;

[Interjections.]

That racist should shut up! [Interjections.]


  (2) further notes that this stated intention is tantamount to a  flagrant
       disregard for the ``rule of law'' ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Hon member, no hon member may  accuse  any
members of this House of being racist. Can you please withdraw that?

Mr S ABRAM:  Madam  Speaker,  fine,  they  are  not  racist,  but  they  are
prejudiced against dark skinned people. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, when you withdraw, I would not like  you  to
extend your statement. I would like you to withdraw.

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I withdraw. [Interjections.]


  (2) further notes that this stated intention is tantamount to a  flagrant
       disregard  for  the  ``rule  of  law''  in  the  face  of  widespread
       international and multilateral opposition to such a course of action,
       and that it flies in the face of international law and convention;

[Interjections.]


  (3) calls upon the international community to reject  the  intentions  of
       the USA, which will result in misery, destruction  and  the  loss  of
       lives of innocent Iraqi civilians;

[Interjections.]


  (4) further calls specifically upon South African representatives at  the
       UN to resist any attempt by the USA to get approval for a destructive
       course of action that will endanger not only  the  stability  of  the
       Middle East, but the whole world; and

[Interjections.]


  (5) calls upon the millions of sober-minded  and  peace-loving  Americans
       and British people, and others around the globe, to mount a  campaign
       of writing letters, signing petitions and communicating with  US  and
       UK embassies, expressing their opposition to military  action.  [Time
       expired.]

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Ms L MABE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Comrade Siphiwe Lawrence Zuma, President of the SA Student
       Congress and the SA Universities SRCs died at Newcastle  Hospital  on
       Wednesday, 11 September 2002;


  (2) further notes  that  Comrade  Siphiwe  Zuma  and  his  comrades  were
       involved in a car accident  on  their  way  to  attend  the  National
       Congress of the SA Democratic Teachers Union;


  (3) also notes that the African National  Congress  dips  its  banner  in
       honour of this young revolutionary, a dedicated cadre of our movement
       to the end; and


  (4)  expresses  its  condolences  to  his  family  and  friends  and  the
       leadership collective of Sasco and the progressive  student  movement
       as a whole.

Dr C P MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee kennis  dat  ek  op  die  volgende
sittingsdag van die Huis, namens die VF, sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)   daar  tans  oorweldigende  steun  deur   verskillende   groepe,
           byvoorbeeld die Oorlegforum, Vriende vir Afrikaans, Groep van 63
           en  'n  Afrikaanse  groep   van   17   bekende   Suid-Afrikaners
           uitgespreek word ten gunste van die behoud van die  Universiteit
           van Stellenbosch as 'n Afrikaanse universiteit;


       (b)  Christa van Zyl, 'n derdejaarstudent aan  die  Universiteit  van
           Stellenbosch, 'n taalpetisie begin het  waarin  gevra  word  dat
           Afrikaans behoue moet bly by die Universiteit van  Stellenbosch;
           en


       (c)  hierdie petisie van Van Zyl oorweldigende reaksie op die  kampus
           uitlok, en dat tot onlangs reeds meer  as  2  000  studente  die
           petisie onderteken het; en


  (2)  haar  gelukwens  en  sy  volle  ondersteuning  uitspreek  vir   haar
       lofwaardige poging om, in haar eie woorde,  ``die  taalfakkel  op  te
       neem'', en om sodoende saam met  al  die  ander  drukgroepe  te  help
       toesien dat Stellenbosch 'n Afrikaanse universiteit bly.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  that enormous support is currently being  expressed  by  various
           groups, such as,  for  example,  the  Oorlegforum,  Vriende  vir
           Afrikaans, Groep van 63 and an Afrikaans group of 17  well-known
           South Africans, in favour of the retention of the University  of
           Stellenbosch as an Afrikaans university;


       (b)  Christa van Zyl, a  third-year  student  at  the  University  of
           Stellenbosch, has started a language petition  in  which  it  is
           requested that Afrikaans should survive  at  the  University  of
           Stellenbosch; and


       (c)  this petition of van Zyl's is  eliciting  enormous  reaction  on
           campus and that until  recently  more  than  2000  students  had
           already signed the petition; and


  (2) congratulates her and expresses its full support for her praiseworthy
       attempt to, in her own words, ``take up the language torch''  and  in
       so doing, along with the other  pressure  groups,  help  ensure  that
       Stellenbosch remains an Afrikaans university.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  it  has  been
brought to my attention that when the hon Ms Mabe was reading her notice  of
motion, expressing  condolence,  a  member  from  the  DP  benches  shouted:
``Aids!'' when she said that Comrade Zuma had passed away. [Interjections.]

We would submit that that is not parliamentary, and that it  displays  gross
insensitivity to the problems we face as a nation. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I would like any  member  who  might  have  said  so  to
please withdraw that, because I do not think that it will be fair.

Mr B G BELL: Madam  Speaker,  I  apologise.  It  was  totally  unacceptable.
[Interjections.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the  ongoing  tug-of-war  between  the  Mpumalanga
       Education  Department  and  Laerskool   Middelburg,   regarding   the
       declaration of the school as a dual-medium one by the Department  and
       the opposition thereto by the school;


  (2) prays fervently that children should not become the subject matter of
       a dispute between people who hold  different  views  on  how  schools
       should be run;


  (3) brings to the attention of  the  school  authorities  that  a  public
       school has to be accessible to all children who live in its vicinity,
       regardless of their  race,  sex,  pigmentation,  language  or  social
       background;


  (4) pleads with the education authorities in the province and the  school
       to ensure that the interests of the learners are the guiding  factor;
       and


  (5) calls on the Minister of Education to step in to resolve  the  absurd
       situation in which education is denied to  English-speaking  children
       by the school.

Mrs M L NGWENYA: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  held  in
       Johannesburg resolved to  halve  the  proportion  of  people  without
       access to safe drinking water and sanitation by 2015;
  (2) further notes that this move is part of plans to  provide  a  healthy
       environment through improving sanitation in households and in  public
       institutions;


  (3) believes that this represents a conscious attempt by world leaders to
       create a  friendly  global  environment,  and  to  reduce  levels  of
       poverty; and


  (4) welcomes this decision taken at the Summit, as this will improve  the
       quality of life of people, especially the poor throughout the world.

[Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -
       (a)  that is has  been  five  months  since  the  KwaZulu-Natal  Aids
           Project secured R800 million from the Global Fund;


       (b)  that Government has yet to approve the funding and is basing the
           delay on the fact that proper protocol was not followed; and


       (c)  that the reality is that Government is  hoping  that  the  delay
           tactics will cause the loss of this funding  because  Government
           is reluctant to support the KwaZulu-Natal  bid,  which  includes
           anti-retroviral therapy; and


  (2) calls on Government and  the  Minister  of  Health  to  stop  playing
       childish games, and to allow the funding  to  be  channelled  to  the
       rightful proposers so that they can continue with their projects.

[Applause.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that, on  1  October,  the  ``kerb-to-kerb''  public  transport
       system, which consists of wheelchair-friendly minibuses, and is aimed
       at people with disabilities unable to use existing  forms  of  public
       transport, will be introduced to Cape Town;


  (2) hopes that this  service  will  be  affordable  to  all  people  with
       disabilities;


  (3) acknowledges that this service will be of  great  assistance  to  the
       disabled community; and


  (4) congratulates the people responsible for bringing this service to the
       people.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that the spin doctor of the  provincial  government  of
       the Western Cape, which was controlled by the DA, paid R123 000 to DA
       spin doctor Ryan Coetzee between April and July last year;

[Interjections.]


  (2) believes that the DA abused taxpayers' money to fund  its  own  party
       operation and has failed to separate party structures from government
       structures;


  (3) further believes that the conduct of the DA during its reign of power
       in the Western Cape demonstrates hypocrisy  and  opportunism,  as  it
       agitates for clean, transparent  and  accountable  government,  while
       having done exactly the opposite during this period; and

[Interjections.]


  (4) calls on the DA to come clean on the allegations  of  corruption  and
       maladministration during their reign of power in the Western Cape.

[Applause.] [Interjections.]

                      ANNIVERSARY OF STEVE BIKO'S DEATH

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that today is the twenty-fifth  anniversary  of  the  death  in
       detention of the founder member and father of the Black Consciousness
       Movement in this country, Stephen Bantu Biko;


  (2) recalls the monumental contribution that Biko made to the  liberation
       struggle in his quest to bestow a human face on our country; and


  (3) salutes this gallant and fine Son of the Soil.

[Applause.]

Agreed to.

        CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL TO BE REFERRED TO AN AC HOC COMMITTEE

                             (Draft Resolution)

the Majority Party's as follows:

       SOUTH AFRICAN MARITIME AND AERONAUTICAL SEARCH AND RESCUE BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Mr Chairperson, Acting President, colleagues  and
hon members, it is a pleasure to introduce the debate  on  the  SA  Maritime
and Aeronautical Search and Rescue Bill, 2002.

Before 1958, there was no formal organisation  responsible  for  search  and
rescue in South Africa. However, an obligation for ships to  assist  vessels
in distress was enshrined in a tradition and international  treaties.  On  1
October 1958, the department of transport became  responsible  for  the  co-
ordination of the SA Maritime and Aeronautical Search and Rescue  Programme,
and the permanent committee for search and rescue was created.

In  October  1961,  the  government  widened  the  scope  of  the  permanent
committee and changed its title to the  Permanent  Executive  Committee  for
Search and Rescue. There are two conventions  which  are  relevant  in  this
regard ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Honourable  members,  can  we  settle
down please? I am sorry, Minister. Please continue.

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: The two conventions relate  to  maritime  matters
and aviation-related  matters.  The  International  Convention  on  Maritime
Search and Rescue, which is  commonly  known  as  the  SAR  Convention,  was
adopted in Hamburg in 1979. It was  aimed  at  developing  an  international
search and rescue plan so that, no matter  where  an  accident  occurs,  the
rescue of persons in distress will be co-ordinated by a  search  and  rescue
organisation and, where  necessary,  by  co-operation  between  neighbouring
search and rescue organisations. The adoption of  this  convention  saw  the
Pecsar being changed to the SA Search and  Rescue  Organisation  in  keeping
with  its  national  character  and  to  identify  it  as  a  South  African
organisation.

The convention makes provision, amongst  others,  for  rescue  co-ordination
centres and sub-centres. It outlines operating procedures to be followed  in
the event of emergencies or alerts or during search and  rescue  operations.
This includes the designation of  an  on-scene  commander  and  his  duties.
Parties to the convention are required to establish ship  reporting  systems
under which ships report their position to a  coastal  radio  station.  This
enables the  interval  between  loss  of  contact  with  a  vessel  and  the
initiation of search operations to be  reduced.  It  also  helps  to  commit
rapid  determination  of  vessels  that  may  be  called  upon  to   provide
assistance,  including  medical  help,  where  necessary.  That  relates  to
maritime matters.

Then there is the Convention on International Civil  Aviation.  Annexure  12
to that convention  follows  the  ideas  which  are  contained  in  the  SAR
Convention. I am happy to report that South Africa,  as  a  party  to  these
conventions, has already complied with most, if not all, of  the  provisions
of these conventions.

I just want to briefly give members two examples of disasters in  which  the
SA Search and Rescue Organisation intervened  with  a  view  to  search  and
rescue. First and foremost is the Helderberg  disaster  when  an  SAA  plane
went down 300 km off Mauritius on 28 November 1987. Our  search  and  rescue
organisation co-ordinators were called to be in charge of  this  search  and
rescue effort in co-operation with the Mauritian  authorities.  That  is  an
aviation example.

Then there is a maritime example, which I want to use. Members  will  recall
that, on 4 August 1991, a luxury liner, the Oceanos, sank  off  Koffie  Bay.
All the 571 Greek passengers on the liner  were  saved.  This  accorded  the
organisation in our country international  recognition  and  respect.  There
are many other incidents of successful rescues to which I can  refer.  There
is no need, however, to go into those details at this  stage.  But  I  would
like to thank all those who have been involved in our Sasar, the  SA  search
and rescue efforts. I also want to thank the National Sea Rescue  Institute,
whose members render  voluntary  service.  They  have  rendered  outstanding
services to the country. I also want to thank Samsa, the SA Maritime  Safety
Authority, for the work which it has done in this regard.

The South African Maritime and Aeronautical Search and Rescue Bill seeks  to
provide a legal framework and statutory framework for  the  provision  of  a
certain  rescue  service  in  South  Africa.  It  also  provides   for   the
incorporation  of  the  international  conventions   -   the   International
Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue,  1979,  and  Annexure  12  to  the
Convention of International of International Civil Aviation, 1944 - so  that
they become part of South African Law.

Lastly, I thank all members of the portfolio committee  for  its  work  with
regard to this matter,  all  the  members  of  Sasar  -  the  Department  of
Defence, Telkom SA, the Police, Air Traffic  Navigation  Services  Co.  Ltd,
the SA Maritime Safety Authority, S A Airways  and  many  other  people  who
have helped making certain that rescue is put high on the  agenda  of  South
Africa and to make it a success. [Applause.]

Mr J P CRONIN: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister  and  fellow  members,  I  think
that the hon the Minister has very adequately covered the Bill and there  is
no need, in summary, to say very much.

This South African Maritime and Aeronautical Search  and  Rescue  Bill  does
two basic things. On the one hand, it incorporates into  South  African  law
two very important international conventions on search and rescue  to  which
our  country  already  is  a  signatory,  and  further  provides  the  legal
framework for the SA Search and Rescue Organisation, Sasar, as it  is  often
called.

Sasar has existed since 1958. It is  basically  a  co-ordinating  committee,
bringing together the skills and resources of a wide  range  of  appropriate
entities  that  may,  from  time  to  time,  be  involved  in  maritime   or
aeronautical search and rescue operations. These  entities  include  the  SA
Police Service, the  SA  National  Defence  Force,  the  SA  Civil  Aviation
Authority, the SA Maritime Safety  Authority,  Air  Traffic  and  Navigation
Services Co.  Ltd,  Telkom,  local  governments,  the  National  Sea  Rescue
Institute and so forth.

South Africa, by international agreement, has a very  extensive  search  and
rescue area.  It  includes  not  just  our  own  land  territory,  but  very
extensive areas of the south Atlantic Ocean and the south  Indian  Ocean  as
well. Unlike the wealthiest countries, such as the UK or the United  States,
we cannot afford to have a permanent coastguard-type agency,  for  instance.
So  we  have  this  co-ordinating  structure  that,  by  all  accounts,  has
performed exceptionally well over many years and the hon  the  Minister  has
mentioned a number of high-profile cases. In  fact,  just  yesterday,  there
was another ship in  distress  off  Richards  Bay  and  the  crew  were  all
successfully evacuated from it.

Included on the Sasar structure are appropriate government  departments  and
public agencies, but also some NGOs and, most noticeably, the  National  Sea
Rescue Institute. The NSRI made  a  useful  presentation  to  the  portfolio
committee on this Bill. We would like to commend, as the  hon  the  Minister
has just done, the approximately 650 NSRI  volunteers  who  maintain  rescue
stations all along our coastline, 24 hours a day, from Sodwana  to  Saldanha
Bay. We think that this voluntary work  is  extremely  commendable  in  this
year of letsema or volunteerism.

We had, as the hon the Minister knows, a slight wobble in the processing  of
this Bill as a  portfolio  committee.  We  had  already  completed  what  we
thought was the formalisation of the Bill and we were  bringing  it  to  the
National Assembly when Telkom made a very belated plea to us.  They  pointed
out to us that  the  draft  legislation  did  not  make  provision  for  the
proposed restructuring and perhaps privatisation  of  Telkom,  nor  for  the
proposed second and what would be a competing fixed line operator.

As a committee, we thought that Telkom had a  legitimate  point  and  so  we
brought the Bill back to the committee. We removed all  specific  references
to Telkom and made a more general reference to the obligations, in terms  of
sea  and  rescue  operations,  of  any   provider   of   a   public   switch
telecommunication service.  We  are  happier  with  this  as  the  portfolio
committee, and I think that holds true across parties. We believe Telkom  is
happier, and so is the department.

The ANC supports the SA Maritime and Aeronautical Search  and  Rescue  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr S PILLAY: Mr Chairman, the SA Maritime and Aeronautical  Rescue  Bill  is
an essential one and seeks to incorporate international  marine  search  and
civil aviation conventions into  South  African  law.  It  also  establishes
Sasar as an organisation  to  act  as  the  authority  responsible  for  the
implementation of those conventions. It is an important Bill.  Not  only  is
it important, it is  also  essential.  The  recent  spate  of  aviation  and
maritime disasters clearly indicate that we need to drastically improve  our
efficiency in terms of search and rescue. This Bill puts  in  place  certain
mechanisms and  lays  obligations  on  specific  government  departments  to
implement the aims and objectives of Sasar.

The South African coastline is renowned  for  its  devious  and  treacherous
seas, and not a day goes by without the National Sea Rescue Institute  being
involved in the rescue of some type of seacraft and its personnel  that  are
in distress. We need to give recognition  to  the  excellent  work  by  this
institute in saving lives and property. The NSRI was  established  about  35
years ago and their growth has been steady  and  consistent  to  the  extent
that they now operate 27 stations using 58 vessels.

All these are  operated  by  approximately  600  volunteers  who  selflessly
provide time and money to this noble cause. Other than an annual grant  from
the Department of Transport, much of the operational funds and capital  come
from public donations. Every effort  should  be  made  by  the  Minister  to
obtain more funds for them to continue this essential service  and  be  more
effective. At present, they receive an annual grant  of  a  mere  R400  000.
Sasar's executive committee has recommended that this  amount  be  increased
to R600 000 in addition to a further R600 000 per annum that  will  be  used
for fuels and lubricants in search and rescue operations.  It  is  essential
to note that the NSRI will be  hosting  the  World  Lifeboat  Conference  in
March 2003, which will be another first for South Africa.

Aircraft  and  sea  vessel  passengers  and  crews  will  be  able  to  have
additional peace of mind,  in  the  event  of  a  distressful  incident,  in
knowing that a fully functional search  and  rescue  organisation  has  been
established from which they will be able  to  receive  any  assistance  they
require. The establishment of Sasar should  not  be  viewed  as  an  end  in
itself but as the beginning  of  a  journey,  and  we  encourage  all  South
Africans to become participants in it.  Section  6  states  that  Sasar  may
perform its functions outside the Republic. This is an  excellent  thing  to
have happened. However, consideration must be given to the cost involved  in
any search operation. I would not want the  taxpayer  to  continuously  bear
the  financial  burden  of  operations  outside  of  South  Africa   without
financial assistance from the countries requesting such assistance.  Section
19 is of particular importance. Here  I  would  encourage  the  Minister  to
communicate with all Ministers to obtain their assistance by  ensuring  that
a notice with  this  emergency  number  is  displayed  in  every  government
office. Minister Asmal should not be excluded  from  this  notice,  as  this
notice should be displayed in every school as well.

The Minister should also encourage the Minister of Safety and  Security  and
the Minister of Defence to add elements of this legislation,  including  the
dedicated emergency number, into their training  programmes.  To  illustrate
this point, my colleague, the hon Farrow, contacted  four  different  police
stations and asked them whether they knew who he could contact to  effect  a
search and rescue operation. Predictably, none of them knew. In a  life  and
death situation, this is not acceptable. Section 20 places an obligation  on
the aeronautical rescue co-ordination and the maritime rescue  co-ordination
centre to have a free flow of information, as it  would  result  in  a  more
effective search and rescue service. This  would  require  personnel  to  be
properly trained and cost-minded. [Time expired.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Mr Chairman, hon Minister,  colleagues.  South  Africa  has
the most ... Before I start, I want to apologise for  my  voice.  I  have  a
terrible flu.

South Africa has  the  most  advanced  economy  and  infrastructure  on  the
African continent. In addition, our country sits astride  one  of  the  main
strategic links between east and west and north and south.  The  consequence
of our special strategic and  geographic  position  is  the  fact  that  our
airspace and coastal waters provide lines of  communications  and  trade  to
thousands  of  aeronautical  and  maritime  operators,  both   foreign   and
domestic.  Inevitably,  the  laws  and  nature  dictate  that  some  of  the
operators will experience problems and  emergencies  as  they  traverse  our
airspace or coastal waters. As a responsible  member  of  the  international
community, South Africa has for decades accepted certain search  and  rescue
obligations to assist those operators that find themselves in distress.

The Sasar was established  as  far  back  as  1958  but,  astonishingly,  no
legislation expressly providing for its  establishment  or  functioning  was
ever enacted, even though South Africa  was  a  signatory  to  international
conventions dealing with search and rescue operations. Since our  return  to
the  international   community   in   1994,   the   International   Maritime
Organization and the International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  requested
that this oversight be ratified as soon as possible.

The IFP supports the Bill before the House as it provides a legal  framework
for search and  rescue  services  in  South  Africa  and  provides  for  the
incorporation  of  the  International  Convention  on  Maritime  Search  and
Rescue, 1979 and Annexure  12  of  the  Convention  on  International  Civil
Aviation, 1994 into South African law.

When the Portfolio Committee on Transport first  considered  the  Bill,  the
proposal was that any aircraft or vessel  in  distress  had  to  report  its
situation to the SAPS. As we know,  it  is  no  secret  that  the  SAPS  has
suffered badly from lack of resources, and  we  accordingly  felt  that  the
response  time  would  not  be  adequate  to  deal   with   such   emergency
notifications. When one is in distress, one is really in distress.  Instead,
the committee agreed that a national dedicated  emergency  reporting  number
would be created and manned by the national  Department  of  Transport.  The
IFP fully supports this change.

After we had finalised the Bill, but before it came to  this  House,  Telkom
SA Limited objected to its statutory inclusion in  the  composition  of  the
Sasar on the basis that it may be privatised in  future,  and  it  would  be
unfair  to  prescribe  a  statutory  role  to  a  private  company  in   the
functioning of a state organisation. The Portfolio  Committee  on  Transport
felt Telkom had a convincing argument and it was therefore removed from  the
composition  of  Sasar.  The  IFP  supported  this  move   as   it   clearly
demonstrated  to  us  that,  beyond  the  merits  of  the  argument,  public
participation in the legislative process is a worthy and  valuable  exercise
as the unintended consequences of our  well-meant  decisions  are  sometimes
not immediately obvious. As a result, the legislation is much improved.

The IFP supports the Bill.

Mnr J J NIEMANN: Mnr die Voorsitter, al wat ek kan bydra tot hierdie  debat,
is om n Afrikaans te praat, maar my inhoud  is  presies  dieselfde  wat  die
Minister op 'n baie bekwame wyse aan ons oorgedra het, asook die  voorsitter
van die komitee en die vorige sprekers. As ek nou enigiets moet sê, moet  ek
herhaal wat reeds presies  gesê  is.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Ek  kan  dit  altyd
mooier doen. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr J J NIEMANN: Mr Chairman, all that I can contribute to  this  debate  is
to speak Afrikaans, but my content is exactly the same  as  that  which  the
Minister very competently conveyed to us, as well as the chairperson of  the
committee and the previous speakers. If I have to say anything at all,  then
I would have to repeat exactly what has already been said.  [Interjections.]
I can always do it better.]

As a matter of fact, I want to say it in English. In short, this  Bill  just
creates a legal framework for the provision  of  maritime  and  aeronautical
search and rescue services in South Africa. That is what it boils down to.

Finish en klaar. Baie dankie aan die Minister. Goeie wetgewing. Die Nuwe  NP
steun hierdie maatreël. [Applous.] [``Finish  en  klaar.''  [Over  and  done
with.] Thank you very much to the Minister. Good law. The  New  NP  supports
this legislation. [Applause.]]

Mr D G MKONO: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, it is vital  for  this
Parliament to ensure that South Africa remains on track  and  in  sync  with
international law and convention. The Bill before us today seeks to  achieve
exactly that goal in terms of maritime and aeronautical  search  and  rescue
activities. Given the escalation of maritime  and  aeronautical  traffic  in
and around our borders, the establishment of the Sasar  organisation  cannot
come at a more apt moment in time. Only yesterday, rescue operations had  to
be carried out off the coast of South Africa on  a  vessel  experiencing  an
uncontrolled fire on board.It is apt,  especially  in  terms  of  the  often
treacherous seafaring conditions along our coastline and the importance  for
South Africa and  many  of  its  landlocked  neighbours'  economies  of  our
harbours for export and import facilities.

The ability of the SA Government to mount search and rescue missions  cannot
be overstated. Notwithstanding South Africa's  long-standing  reputation  of
assisting troubled vessels such as the courageous effort earlier  this  year
when  a  vessel  became  stranded  in  Antarctica,  improved  co-ordination,
capacity and funding can only be welcomed. The  UDM  supports  the  holistic
and integrated approach  that  underpins  this  Bill  as  reflected  in  the
composition of Sasar under section 5, subsection 1, where all  the  relevant
bodies in  the  maritime  and  aeronautical  services  and  regulations  are
included. Similarly,  the  creation  of  rescue  co-ordination  centres  and
subcentres will ensure proper,  timely  and  integrated  search  and  rescue
management.

Finally,  we  cannot  disregard  the  new  world  of  transport  safety  and
regulations that we live in post 11 September 2001.  In  this  regard,  too,
the Bill is a necessary and adequate measure. Therefore,  the  UDM  supports
the Bill.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon Minister and members,  the  SA  Maritime  and
Aeronautical Search and Rescue Bill provides the  legal  framework  for  the
provision of a search and rescue service in South Africa, to  empower  those
responsible to carry out their tasks  effectively  and  to  incorporate  the
international convention  on  maritime  search  and  rescue  into  our  law.
Currently, organisations involved in search and rescue are  doing  so  on  a
voluntary basis with the Department of Transport being expected to  pay  for
fuel and lubricants used during search and rescue operations.

Today I would like to pay special tribute  to  the  NSRI  which,  since  its
inception in May 1967, has, as at July 2002, conducted  11  222  search  and
rescue operations, has assisted 18 141 persons and 3  787  boats  and,  most
significantly, has saved 1 865 lives. In the 35 years  of  their  existence,
they have had only one fatality.

The ACDP supports this Bill. [Time expired.]

Mrs N D MBOMBO: Chairperson, the South African Maritime Aeronautical  search
and Rescue Bill legislates  for  a  structure  that  has  actually  been  in
existence for some years. The South African Search and  Rescue  organisation
was launched in 1958. Sasar has  been  providing  the  research  and  rescue
function on behalf of  the  South  African  Government,  which  is  also  in
accordance with the various international conventions to which South  Africa
is a signatory.

The Sasar is in fact a co-ordinating structure in the case of a  search  and
rescue operation. The Sasar draws on the resources and expertise of  various
role-players. Many of these role-players are  from  Government,  the  SANDF,
the  SA  Police  Services,  the  National  Port  Authority,   air   traffic,
navigational services, the SA Maritime Association, the  Civil  Association,
Telkom, etc.

The Sasar has also been able  to  call  on  the  services  of  a  number  of
voluntary organisations including the National Sea Rescue Institute and  the
Mountain Club of South Africa. Search and rescue efforts  involving  vessels
at sea or aeroplanes very often require international co-operation.  Indeed,
South  Africa  is  a  signatory  to  two  international  conventions  -  the
International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue  and  the  Convention
on Civil Aviation. This Bill formally incorporates  these  conventions  into
South  African  law.  South  Africa  also  has  a  number  of  international
obligations in terms  of  various  treaties  to  assume  responsibility  for
extensive parts  of  the  southern  Atlantic  and  southern  Indian  Oceans.
Although it has been in existence since 1958, the  co-ordinating  structures
did not have any legislation providing for their existence.  This  has  been
identified as a potential weakness by our key international  partners.  Most
of them have relevant national legislation.

This is what we are seeking to correct  in  this  Bill.  Passing  this  Bill
might  also  have  the  additional  advantage  that  it  could  enable   the
Department of Transport to subsidise a little more generously  some  of  the
voluntary organisations, in particular. Over the last few years,  Government
has given an annual subsidy of R400 000 to the  NSRI.  We  are  hoping  that
consideration might be given to a slightly more generous  approach  to  this
important voluntary organisation.

The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, I want to  comment  on  one  or  two
aspects. The firstly is that of our international obligations. I  think  the
hon Pillay referred to our search  and  rescue  efforts  being  extended  to
include neighbouring  countries,  for  example.  The  reality  is  that  the
conventions imposed obligations upon  us.  They  are  not  just  obligations
which we have taken upon ourselves even though, without the  conventions,  I
believe South Africa, being  a  caring  society,  would  have,  nonetheless,
accepted  the  responsibility.  The  IMO   has   designated   an   area   of
responsibility, to which the hon Cronin referred. On the  western  side,  it
is approximately half-way between South Africa and  South  America.  On  the
eastern  side,  it  is  approximately  half-way  between  South  Africa  and
Australia. On the northern  side,  it  borders  on  Namibia,  Angola,  South
Africa and Mozambique and proceeds right down to  the  South  Pole.  So,  in
terms of the IMO designation, we have a huge area of responsibility.

Secondly, with regard to our international obligations, what  we  are  doing
is to negotiate, not only with our neighbouring countries,  but  with  other
countries generally, across the globe, wherever possible, and to enter  into
mutual agreements on certain rescue matters. We  have  already  concluded  a
large  number  of  agreements  and  we  are  in  the  middle  of  conducting
negotiations for other agreements as well.
I am very supportive of the efforts of the NGOs, and I am thinking  here  in
particular of the NSRI. A number of members have spoken about. I do  believe
that, if  it  is  possible,  the  subsidies  paid  to  the  NSRI  should  be
increased. [Applause.] At the same time, I  encourage  entities  which  also
report to me to make donations  to  the  NSRI.  For  example,  the  airports
company in South Africa makes a substantial donation to NSRI as  well.  But,
because of the nature of its services and the  sacrifices  members  of  NSRI
make, the voluntary nature of the service by over 600 members,  I  do  think
they are an organisation worthy of support.

Lastly, I want to make the point that our biggest weakness, at  the  moment,
relates to fishing vessel safety. There has been interaction between  myself
and the SAMSA. Two  conferences  have  already  been  held,  and  SAMSA  are
currently preparing a draft action plan so that  we  address  the  issue  of
fishing vessels adequately. So, without going into  detail,  I  give  notice
that I will be coming to the portfolio committee with a report on  the  work
which we are doing on fishing vessel safety because  if  one  looks  at  the
incidence of loss of life at sea, generally, it has involved  small  fishing
vessels and many of those losses can be avoided.

Finally, I take this opportunity and thank the  portfolio  committee  again.
As could be heard from the contributions which all  the  hon  members  made,
very useful and constructive suggestions have been made.  I  want  to  thank
the portfolio committee, its chairperson, Jeremy Cronin, for  work  that  it
has done and, once again, I thank all those involved in  search  and  rescue
efforts. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                      ROAD ACCIDENT FUND AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, there is no need for me to dwell  at
length on the amendments for which we seek the approval of this House.
Basically, we are asking that a provision which makes  the  Director-General
of Transport  a  member  of  the  board  be  amended  to  enable  him,  when
necessary, to be represented by a substitute. The reason for  this  is  that
there have been a number of occasions on which the Director-General has  not
been available, which is not good for the Road Accident Fund Board.

Secondly, the Act provides that the board is to have at  least  11  but  not
more  than  12  other  members,  appointed  by  the  Minister  of  Transport
according to the procedure laid down in the Act.  This  minimum  of  11  and
maximum of 12 members has created a problem. The second amendment  therefore
seeks to  create  a  bit  of  flexibility  and  provides  for  an  appointed
membership of at least eight but not more than 12 persons. Then we will  not
run into trouble if one or two people should resign.

Lastly, I have a problem with the fact that the  procedure  whereby  members
of the board are appointed is very cumbersome. The  process  commences  with
the publication, by the  Minister,  of  a  call  for  nominations.  This  is
followed  by  the  publication  of  a  list  of  nominees.  Then  comes  the
establishment of a five-member selection committee, on which the two  Houses
of Parliament are also represented. This is followed  by  public  interviews
of the nominees. This is  then  followed  by  recommendations  made  by  the
selection committee to the Minister and thereafter the  Minister  makes  the
appointments.

In general, I do not have a problem  with  that  procedure.  It  is  a  good
procedure, which protects me to a  large  extent.  It  involves  the  House,
which is able to participate in these processes. The problem I  have  raised
is where vacancies occur.  The  question  is  whether  the  same  cumbersome
procedure should be followed if  a  vacancy  occurs.  The  purpose  of  this
amendment, and my proposal to the House, is that I should  not  be  required
to follow this cumbersome procedure.

It  is  not  intended  to  create  an  opening  for  the  Minister  to  make
appointments willy-nilly, the way he likes. I do not envisage, for  example,
that during the course of a year  there  would  be  more  than  one  or  two
vacancies. It is in order to deal with that kind of situation that there  is
a proposal that the Minister should be  allowed  to  make  the  appointment,
taking into account the criteria laid down in the Act. This is only  insofar
as vacancies are concerned.

When the new board is to be appointed, the original procedure  and  all  the
criteria and safeguards will remain in place. This is the  aspect  which,  I
know, has  caused  some  pain  and  concern  to  members  of  the  portfolio
committee. I want to assure hon members, however, that this is  designed  to
deal with a situation only where a vacancy occurs and  no  other  situation.
[Applause.]

Mr A R AINSLIE:  Mr  Chairperson,  Minister  and  colleagues,  I  think  the
Minister has dealt very  convincingly  with  the  need  for  the  amendments
before us today. In doing so, he has also highlighted the importance of  the
Road Accident Fund.

While nothing can make up for the trauma and loss  suffered  by  victims  of
road accidents and their  loved  ones,  the  Road  Accident  Fund  at  least
provides some measure of relief. This relief is  especially  important  when
it comes to assisting poor households whose breadwinner has been  killed  or
seriously injured in a road smash, and so many of  them  do  happen  in  our
country. It is an important institution, therefore, and it needs to  operate
efficiently and responsibly in pursuing its objectives.

In order to do this, the  fund  needs  a  strong  and  properly  functioning
board. This is the purpose of the Bill before us today.  It  proposes  three
amendments to the principal Act, so as to ensure the smooth  functioning  of
the  board.  The  Minister  has  gone  into  great  detail  regarding  these
amendments and I do not believe there is any need for me to do so.

However, I do want to emphasise the importance of clause  1,  which  enables
the Director of Transport, who is a member of the board,  to  designate  any
senior officer in the national Department of Transport as a substitute  when
unable to attend board meetings. This will not only assist the  quorum,  but
will also ensure that the department is represented at all meetings  of  the
board.

The Minister has emphasised the importance of clause 1(b)  and  has  pointed
out the  cumbersome  procedure,  under  normal  circumstances,  involved  in
actually appointing members to the board. The overall objective of the  Bill
is therefore to ensure a properly  functioning  board.  This  is  made  more
important in view of the imminent report  of  the  Satchwell  Commission  of
Inquiry. There have been several vacancies on the board over  the  past  few
months, making it difficult for the board to function.

Section 9 of the principal Act provides for a procedure to  appoint  members
to the board every three years. There is no provision  for  the  filling  of
vacancies. The section 9 procedure would be far too long and  costly  to  be
used for this purpose. This Bill, therefore, gives  the  Minister  power  to
fill such vacancies.

We  understand  the  concerns  of  some  opposition  parties  regarding  the
authority given to the  Minister  to  appoint  members  to  the  board  when
occasional vacancies occur. The identity of those parties will no  doubt  be
revealed when they speak a little later  on.  However,  their  concerns  are
exaggerated and invalid.

Firstly, the Minister is required to take  into  account,  when  applicable,
the categories of persons to be appointed, as listed in the  Act.  Secondly,
he may only fill a  vacancy  for  the  unexpired  portion  of  the  previous
member's term of  office.  Thirdly,  and  most  importantly,  the  Satchwell
Commission's report,  once  tabled,  will  give  us  the  opportunity  of  a
thorough examination of the nature of road  accident  compensation  and  the
structure  of  the  institutions  that  are  best  suited  to  deliver  such
compensation.

It makes no sense at all to engage in a time-consuming  process  of  filling
vacancies  on  the  board  or  to  begin  a  long  drawn-out   exercise   of
restructuring the board before the report of the Satchwell Commission.  Yes,
this report is now overdue, but I have no doubt that, once published, it  is
going to be a world-class piece of work that will give us the basis  for  an
extensive review of the whole system.

It does make sense to ensure  that  the  Road  Accident  Fund  continues  to
operate effectively. This requires the board to be properly  constituted  at
all times. That is why the Minister must be in a position to fill  vacancies
as they arise.

The ANC supports the amendments. [Applause.]

Mr S B FARROW: Chairperson, the Bill before us, although  minor  in  nature,
can play a major part in ensuring good corporate governance in a fund  which
has, for many years being dogged by poor management, corruption and  a  lack
of direction. I trust that the Minister, having now been  given  this  power
to appoint vacancies to the board in exceptional  cases  where  resignations
occur during a term of office, will ensure that  only  competent  candidates
are considered and  that  the  parliamentary  portfolio  committee  is  kept
informed about such appointments.

The fund is technically insolvent and costs  the  petrol  consumers  of  our
country some R2 billion annually or approximately 16 cents for  every  litre
we put in our tanks. The objectives  of  the  fund  and  how  it  helps  out
victims of those injured in motor vehicle  accidents  is  not  questionable,
but the methods of how claimants are paid out and what  these  victims  have
to go through to process their claims and the fact that some 48%  of  claims
go into attorneys' costs and administration is unacceptable.

A recent question put to the Minister revealed that the fund  has  paid  out
R134 million to attorneys and counsel  for  the  financial  year  ending  30
April 2001. Due to the fact that many of  these  claims  were  corrupt,  the
Minister quite rightly instituted a commission of inquiry into the  fund  by
Judge Satchwell in October 1998. The public  had  great  expectations.  Yet,
some four years later, we still have not had sight of that report despite  a
number of extensions. A recent media report which came from  the  Minister's
office  saying  that  it  would  be  out  by  the  end  of  August  has  not
materialised.

I trust that this report will not be subjected to  any  further  delay.  The
terms of reference given to Judge Satchwell were clear and  one  would  have
thought that with numerous previous White Papers and recommendations  coming
out of investigations and from the Government, a clear strategy would  have,
by now, emerged as to how the fund should be managed, who qualifies and  how
the payment is made.

Similar funds operate in many countries and one does not  have  to  reinvent
the wheel. A simple user-friendly claim system needs to  be  put  in  place,
the claim needs to be finalised in the way  of  payments,  and  it  is  then
approved accordingly. Yet, it appears that the fund has become  the  milking
cow  for  the  minority  of  unscrupulous  attorneys  and  doctors  bent  on
maximising  their  costs  through  unnecessary  litigation,  corruption  and
excessive claims to the detrimental  effect  on  the  poor  and  unfortunate
victim.

It is gratifying, therefore, that the at last the RAF management  and  board
has started to bring these crooks to  book,  and  the  SA  Law  Society  has
commenced a campaign to accredit the attorneys who have clients at heart  of
this nature. The recent arrest of  49  people  for  operating  a  fraudulent
scheme to siphon off millions of rands from the fund  in  the  Eastern  Cape
and the R20 million fraud involving two East Rand lawyers appears to be  the
tip of the iceberg, and should be encouraged and supported.

The DA has consistently called for  investigations  of  this  nature  to  be
undertaken by the special investigation unit, and we will continue to do  so
until such time that all the fraud and corruption has been  eradicated  from
the fund. These investigations could not have happened sooner, and  the  RAF
Board has some serious business ahead of them. Now that  they  are  free  of
conflicts of interest and a new CEO is running the fund, the public  is  now
awaiting an improved performance and the assurance that  the  public  moneys
are better managed.

However, the process can  only  begin  once  the  Satchwell  report  finally
reaches Parliament as there is no doubt that further amendments to the  Road
Accident Fund Act will be forthcoming,  after  which,  hopefully,  the  fund
will be put on a sound financial and management footing.

The DA will, needless to say, support this amendment. [Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chairperson, I must really thank the Minister for his  very
clear message about why this Bill is necessary. It is common knowledge  that
thousands of accidents occur on  South  Africa's  roads  every  year.  These
accidents affect many thousands of our citizens through  loss  of  life  and
serious injuries. They also take a  heavy  toll  on  our  economy,  but  the
effects of road accidents are most keenly felt  by  the  thousands  who  are
seriously injured through loss of employment, productivity and normal life.

The Road Accident Fund, therefore, plays a vital role  in  compensating  the
victims of road accidents for the losses they have suffered. It  is  in  the
public and national interest that the RAF function at the  highest  possible
level of efficiency as it is not only funded by taxpayers' money,  but  also
ensures that victims receive equitable and  timeous  compensation.  But  the
RAF is, in many respects, a critically ill organisation. I do not think  the
Minister will deny that. I will return to this issue later.

The Bill before us today has three main objectives. First,  it  enables  the
Minister of Transport to fill an occasional vacancy  on  the  RAF  Board  by
appointing  another  person  for  the  unexpired  portion  of  the  previous
member's  three-year  term  of  office.  When  the  Portfolio  Committee  of
Transport debated this issue, my initial stance was that it was  unnecessary
to give the Minister such powers as an appointment could be  made  from  the
existing  shortlist  of  candidates  that  had  already  gone  through   the
selection process.

However, after thorough consideration, I now fully  support  this  amendment
as it has become clear to my party and I that it would assist  in  improving
the RAF's performance. The IFP feels that any change that  will  enable  the
RAF to operate more effectively for the victims of road accidents is a  step
in the right direction. The IFP also supports the other two main  objectives
of the Bill that, firstly, enable  the  Director  General  of  Transport  to
designate any other senior officer in the national Department  of  Transport
to act as a substitute on the board, and secondly, that the  RAF  Board  has
an appointed membership of at least eight but not more than twelve.

The IFP will, therefore, support the Road Accident Fund Amendment Bill.

Ek kan nie glo dat daar iemand is wat dit nie steun  nie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
[I cannot believe it  that  there  is  someone  who  does  not  support  it.
[Interjections.]

Earlier on, I alluded to the problems being experienced in and by  the  Road
Accident Fund. This is no secret as the allegations of corruption and  fraud
by the officials of the RAF and professionals deriving work  from  the  fund
follow the media headings on a regular basis. There is  also,  at  least,  a
suspicion that the fund is technically bankrupt. The Government is aware  of
the problems, as it appointed Judge Satchwell to investigate, but  the  fact
of the matter is that almost four years later, we are still awaiting on  the
results from Judge Satchwell.

The IFP feels that drastic changes are needed to restore  public  confidence
in the RAF, and we call on the Minister to make those  changes  as  soon  as
possible. The victims of road accidents deserve that and  I  know  that  the
Minister will, and he wants to. [Applause.]

Mnr J J NIEMANN: Mnr die Voorsitter, die Minister  en  die  vorige  sprekers
het ook  reeds  die  posisie  van  die  direkteur-generaal  behandel,  asook
hierdie 11:8-verhouding teenoor die raad, maar ek wil stilstaan  by  artikel
10(9) van die hoofwet, wat voorsiening maak  vir  'n  openbare,  deursigtige
proses om raadslede aan te stel. Die Minister en al die vorige sprekers  het
ook daarna verwys.

Die proses neem nou 'n aanvang  deurdat  die  Minister  'n  uitnodiging  vir
nominasies  publiseer,  gevolg  deur  die  publikasie   van   'n   lys   van
genomineerdes, die instel van die keurkomitee van vyf lede,  waarin  hierdie
twee Huise van die Parlement verteenwoordig word,  openbare  onderhoude  met
die genomineerdes en, ten slotte, doen die keurkomitee aanbevelings aan  die
Minister.

Ewe skielik is die proses te tydrowend  om  te  volg.  Nou  wil  die  agbare
Minister die wet so wysig dat hy homself  die  drakoniese  reg  toe-eien  om
enige vakature of vakatures wat nog mag ontstaan, te vul deur die  aanwysing
van enige  ander  persoon  in  daardie  vakante  pos,  of  poste,   vir  die
oorblywende tydperk van daardie vakature. Dit beteken die agb  Minister  kan
in die loop van die tydperk wat oor is, twee, drie,  vier,  vyf,  selfs  ses
raadslede op sy eie aanstel. Gevolglik beteken dit die Minister kan  feitlik
sy eie persoonlike raad aanstel.

Ek het geprobeer om die agbare Minister tot ander insigte te bring.  Ek  het
daar by hom in die bank gaan sit,  en  sy  antwoord  was  kort  en  kragtig:
basta. Dit is jou demokratiese reg om te verskil. Maar natuurlik is  dit  my
demokratiese  reg  om  te  verskil.  [Tussenwerpsels].  Ek  wil  die  agbare
Minister sê dit is 'n vergryp teen die  sogenaamde  demokrasie  waaroor  die
Regering so liries raak. As gevolg van hierdie  vergryp  van  deursigtigheid
en gebrek aan demokratiese beginsels kan  die  Nuwe  NP  die  wysigings  nie
steun nie.

Die vorige spreker het gesê hy kan nie glo  dat  iemand  nie  die  wysigings
steun nie. Maar kom ons staan 'n bietjie stil by daardie punt. By  die  heel
eerste vergadering wat ons gehou het, was  die  portefeuljekomitee  eenparig
in hul besluite om nie  hierdie  reg  uit  te  brei  na  die  Minister  nie.
Eenparig ! Daar was nie een ou wat  verskil  het  daarmee  nie.  Twee,  drie
vergaderings daarna - maar nou moet  ek  sê  daar  het  baie  dinge  in  die
tussentyd met die voorsitter gebeur - toe hou hulle weer vergadering en  wat
gebeur toe? Toe kom die Minister ons tegemoet en hy sê hy  wil  op  'n  slag
hoogstens twee mense vervang wanneer vakatures ontstaan. Toe kom die  DP  en
die IVP en hulle maak beswaar teen die twee, en  nou  stem  hulle  daarvoor,
noudat dit baie erger is as die uitbreiding van net die twee.  Ek  dink  dit
is ongelooflik wat hier aangaan. [Tyd  verstreke.]  [Applous.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J J NIEMANN: Mr Chairman, the Minister and the  previous  speakers  have
also already dealt with the position of the  director-general,  as  well  as
the 11:8 ratio in relation to the council, but I want to  dwell  on  article
10(9) of the main Act  which  makes  provision  for  a  public,  transparent
process for the  appointment  of  councillors.  The  Minister  and  all  the
previous speakers also referred to this.

The process is initiated  by  the  Minister  publishing  an  invitation  for
nominations, followed  by  the  publication  of  a  list  of  nominees,  the
establishment of the selection committee of five  members,  on  which  these
two Houses  of  Parliament  are  represented,  public  interviews  with  the
nominees, and finally the selection committee makes recommendations  to  the
Minister.

Suddenly the process is too  time-consuming  to  follow.  Now  the  hon  the
Minister wants to amend the Act in such  a  way  that  he  appropriates  for
himself the Draconian right to fill any  vacancy  or  vacancies  that  might
still eventuate by the appointment of any other person to that  vacant  post
or posts for the remaining period of that vacancy. This means that  the  hon
the Minister can, during the period that is left, appoint two, three,  four,
five, or even six councillors on his own. Therefore,  thus  means  that  the
Minister can just about appoint his own personal council.

I have tried to bring the hon the Minister to other  insights.  I  sat  with
him on the bench and his answer was short and  sweet:  that's  that.  It  is
one, democratic right to differ. But naturally it is my democratic right  to
differ. [Interjections.] I want to tell the hon the Minister that it  is  an
offence against the so-called transparency about which the Government  waxes
so lyrical. As a result of this offence against  transparency  and  lack  of
democratic principles, the New NP cannot support the amendments.

The previous speaker said that he could  not  believe  that  anybody  had  a
problem supporting the amendments. But let us dwell a little on that  point.
At the very first meeting we held, the  portfolio  committee  was  unanimous
about not extending this power to the Minister.  Unanimous!  There  was  not
one person who differed with that view. Two or three meetings  thereafter  -
but now I have to say that many things  happened  in  the  meantime  to  the
chairperson - a meeting was once again held, and what  happened  then?  Then
the Minister accommodated us and he said he wanted to replace  at  most  two
people at a time if  vacancies  should  arise.  The  DP  and  the  IFP  then
objected against the two, but now they are voting  in  favour  thereof,  now
that it is much worse than the extension of just the two. I think that  what
is happening here is unbelievable. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr D G MKONO: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members the Road Accident  Fund
Bill before us aims to render the representation of the National  Department
of Transport on the board  of  the  Road  Accident  Fund  more  flexible  by
including the DG or his or her rep.  It  also  aims  to  limit  the  minimum
number of appointed members of the board from eight to 12.

Clause 1(c) and (d) of the Bill facilitates  and  enables  the  Minister  to
fill an occasional vacancy by appointing any other person to  serve  on  the
board for the unexpired portion of the previous member's three-year term  of
office. We therefore welcome and support these  efforts  as  this  fund  was
established for the purpose of paying compensation in  accordance  with  the
Act for loss or damage wrongfully caused by the driving of  motor  vehicles.
The constitution of the board is governed by section  10  of  the  principal
Act. It is therefore the responsibility of the Minister to ensure that  this
fund  has  a  board  that  exercises  overall  authority  and  control  over
financial position, operation and management of this fund.

We therefore support this Bill.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, the board of the  Road  Accident  Fund  exercises
overall authority and control and  the  financial  position,  operation  and
management of the Road Accident  Fund  is  subject  to  the  powers  of  the
Minister of Transport.

The Fund is undoubtedly facing a  financial  crisis  and  had  an  actuarial
deficit of  R13,3  billion  at  the  end  of  April  2001.  This  represents
outstanding claims that will have to be paid in future. We  understand  that
the situation  is  deteriorating  as  claims  were  increasing  faster  than
increases in the fuel levy which finances the fund. This, together with  the
large-scale fraud by both outsiders logging false claims and the fund's  own
staff processing or inflating claims  falsely,  contributed  to  the  fund's
problems.

In view of the above, the amendments  were  to  be  welcomed  as  they  made
provision for a more streamlined board by reducing  the  minimum  number  of
board members. The ACDP supports these amendments  and  we  trust  that  the
board will successfully overcome the  severe  challenges  it  faces  and  to
provide  the  South  African  public  with  a  cost-effective  body  to  pay
compensation for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision.

Mr J P CRONIN: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and  hon  members,  as  we  have
heard, three small amendments have been proposed to the Road  Accident  Fund
Act. They have been brought to  Parliament,  because,  basically,  the  Road
Accident Fund Board has not been quorating. There are  several  reasons  for
this failure to quorate. However, in essence, the  problem  stems  from  the
fact that there has been considerably public scrutiny, including  from  this
Parliament, of the Road Accident Fund.

Among the questions that  have  been  raised  have  been  concerns  about  a
potential conflict of interest within the board itself. There  were  members
of the board who at least potentially - one is  not  saying  `actually'  but
`potentially' - through their professional private  activities,  could  have
found themselves on both sides of the street simultaneously, taking  on  the
fund on behalf of claimants and yet also providing leadership  to  the  fund
at the same time.

Members  of  the  portfolio  committee  raised  the  above   matters   quite
forcefully at our meeting with the Road Accident  Fund  Board  earlier  this
year in May. At about the same time,  and  I  am  not  saying  that  it  was
necessarily connected, a number of board members  resigned  from  the  board
without necessarily conceding that they  were  involved  themselves  in  any
wrongdoing.  These  particular  resignations  and  some  others  highlighted
unintended inflexibilities in the original Road Accident Fund Act  in  terms
of the functioning of the board and in terms  of  filling  vacancies,  hence
these amendments that have come to us.
It is the third amendment that has particularly caused some  debate  in  the
portfolio committee, namely the amendment allowing  the  Minister  to  fast-
track replacement appointments in the case of  vacancies.  In  the  existing
Act, the board is appointed through a fairly complex process.  The  Minister
provides a selection committee, which is basically  constituted  of  members
of the NA and NCOP, with a short list and we then conduct public  interviews
of these short-listed candidates and we summit to  the  Minister  a  shorter
list for his final selection.

Some of the hon members have participated in this process and we think  that
it is a good one. It enables us to ask questions in public, on  the  record,
about potential conflicts of interest, for instance. It further  enables  us
as parliamentarians to contribute  to  transforming  the  character  of  the
board and therefore the fund. It also,  as  the  hon  the  Minister  himself
says, protects the  Minister  from  any  potential  allegations.  The  final
selection will, after all, have travelled through an open  public  interview
process. However, there is one drawback. It can be a very lengthy process.

Those who are cynical about parliaments, and they might  be  in  the  media,
should have come to watch the portfolio committee, because  in  the  process
of  considering  these  amendments  our  proceedings  overturned   all   the
stereotypes about political  parties  in  this  Parliament.  Mr  Farrow  ...
[Interjections.] No! No! I am about to offer a bouquet. Mr Farrow of the  DP
immediately expressed his understanding for the hon the Minister's  concerns
and accepted the amendment.  So  who  says  that  the  DP  is  comprised  of
kneejerk oppositionists? It is a very  unfair  allegation.  [Interjections.]
[Laughter.]

Mr Niemann of the New NP has consistently expressed his  party's  opposition
to the proposed amendment. He has been  very  consistent  in  this.  He  has
argued that the appointment of substitutes to a board, especially the  board
of a controversial public entity like the Road Accident Fund,  needs  to  be
vetted in public. Who said that the New NP is neatly in the  pocket  of  the
ANC Government? [Interjections.] [Laughter.]

Mr Slabbert of the IFP was, yes, predictably unpredictable, and in  this  he
was perhaps true to  the  stereotype  about  his  party,  i.e.  that  it  is
unpredictably or predictably unpredictable. But  the  stereotype  says  that
his party is always destructive in  this  predictable  unpredictability  and
that  would  be  extremely  unfair  to  Mr  Slabbert.  He   was   incredibly
constructive and helped us to make progress.

What about the ANC? [Interjections.]  Well,  there  were  several  different
views in the ANC. As  the  ANC,  we  appreciate  the  somewhat  lengthy  but
transparent appointment process and we are reluctant to  depart  from  that,
albeit   for   temporary   midterm   substitutions.   We   debated   various
possibilities as the ANC, for example,  capping  the  number  of  substitute
appointments, whilst some argued for using the extra names  left  over  from
the short list. We debated these things in the ANC study  group  and  indeed
in the portfolio committee as ANC members.  Who  says  that  the  ANC  is  a
monolithic entity, intolerant of internal debate or even public debate?  Not
me! [Interjections.] [Laughter.] [Applause.] We proved it in  the  portfolio
committee! [Interjections.]

In the end, the ANC, and as a majority in the  committee,  agreed  to  amend
the legislation to enable  the  Minister  to  fast-track  appointments  when
vacancies occur in midterm only, not at any  other  time.  We  agreed  as  a
committee that these amendments should be seen in the wider context  of  the
Road Accident Fund that will have to undergo major  transformations  in  the
coming years. We are awaiting, with interest and some impatience,  and  here
I agree with Mr Farrow, the final publication of the  much-anticipated  Road
Accident Fund Commission Report.

Finally, we would like to commend the existing Road Accident Fund Board  and
its CEO, Mr Kgomongwe. They are operating in  very  difficult  circumstances
and we  know  that  they  have  had  difficulties.  However,  despite  these
challenges, the board has been giving leadership to the fund. The spates  of
arrests that others have mentioned are one indication of this. It is a  sign
that the board wants to clean up the act of the fund and we  would  like  to
assure them of our full support in this matter.

The ANC, in its various guises, supports the Road  Accident  Fund  Amendment
Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, hon  members,  my  approach  to  the
Road Accident Fund and its problems is the following:  First,  even  if  the
fund had worked optimally, it appears to have outlived  its  usefulness  and
the reason for that is the many limitations of the fund. Many countries,  as
hon members have pointed  out,  have  moved  in  different  directions.  For
example, there are countries that  have  moved  away  from  the  fault-based
system. We still have the fault-based system.

One of the reasons for the large  amount  of  litigation  and  millions  and
millions being spent on it is the denial by the fund that  the  insured  was
negligent, and then a battle ensues because a claimant claims on  the  basis
of negligence. The fund then says that the insured  was  not  negligent  and
then the matter goes to court. The court has to decide,  and  that  involves
lengthy litigation, large amount of expenses,  a  great  deal  of  pain  for
everyone. The question is that whether time has not  come  for  us  to  move
away from that kind of system.

Secondly, certain claims are kept. Passengers claims in taxis, for  example,
are kept. Some  people  says  it  is  unconstitutional,  yet  it  is  there.
Thirdly, there have been many problems within  the  management,  within  the
fund itself, problems which the current board and the ceo  have  done  their
best to deal with. As the hon Cronin has indicated, they have done  sterling
work. I want to indicate that, in the efforts of the board to  expose  fraud
and corruption including maladministration, it has always  enjoyed  my  100%
support. I meet with the chair of the board, the  chief  executive  officer,
and I encourage them to deal with the matter. I can tell  hon  members  that
it is not very  easy  for  them.  Without  going  into  details,  there  are
syndicates involved that operate in a highly sophisticated  way.  When  they
see their  source  of  funding  threatened,  all  kinds  of  things  happen,
including threats. So they operate in a very difficult environment.

That is why the work of the Satchwell Commission is  so  important.  But  as
hon members have pointed out, the Satchwell Commission  has  been  going  on
and on. I sympathise with Judge Satchwell, even though I am also  impatient.
I share the views of hon members that we must get that  report  as  soon  as
possible.

I sympathise with Judge Satchwell because she  is  a  perfectionist.  And  I
know the work that she has done. I spoke to her yesterday and her  work  has
been completed. It is the question of putting together the  report,  getting
it to typesetters and doing all those practical things  to  make  sure  that
that report is perfect. There are lots of practical things to be done.

Judge Satchwell assures me that she is giving urgent attention to those  and
we are hoping that, over the next month, we will see the end  of  that  saga
and we will have a three-volume report, because it is a three-volume  report
that she will be representing to us. I think that that report  is  going  to
present us with an opportunity of reviewing the fund entirely,  and  for  us
then to emerge with a fund which  will  serve  the  best  interests  of  the
country in the new kind of situation.

I am not going to comment on the amendments again as hon members  have  done
so. I want to thank everybody, including the hon Niemann. I want to  say  to
hon members that he always takes the  trouble,  besides  being  vibrant,  he
comes over. He talks to me and tells me that he is going to oppose this,  or
that he is going to support that, whatever the case may be.  And  I  welcome
this interaction between ourselves. Even to him I want to say thanks. But  I
appeal to the House to support the Bill.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Chairperson, I raise on point of order. Before the hon  the
Minister steps down, will he take a question?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, will you take a question?

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, he has asked very nicely and I  will
take the question.

The CHAIPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Proceed, hon member.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Chairperson, seeing that the Minister is going  to  appoint
members to the board all by himself, will  he  take  the  responsibility  if
that appointed member screws up?

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, I  did  not  want  to  discuss  this
issue. There appears to be, in some quarters, a suspicion of the  executive.
Everything that the executive does must be so scrutinised  that  one  cannot
trust the members of the executive.

I want the hon member to know that there are many other things  that  we  do
where we take  decisions,  and  many  people  that  we  appoint  to  various
positions. And I think that the executive is responsible for  administration
not Parliament. I do believe that Parliament must  scrutinise  and  monitor,
but I am very confident that, in any democracy, the executive has a role  to
perform and we are essentially talking now about executive functions.

But in so far as filling vacancies are concerned, I  am  not  asking  for  a
blank  cheque  to  appoint  members  of  the  board.  We  are  dealing  with
occasional vacancies which may occur. In that kind of situation, I  want  to
ensure that the board continues to function effectively. I put the  proposal
to the House, the House has debated it and members  of  the  different  have
debated it, and the think that that is the best way to go.  And  I  am  very
grateful to those who have taken that position. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

Division demanded.
