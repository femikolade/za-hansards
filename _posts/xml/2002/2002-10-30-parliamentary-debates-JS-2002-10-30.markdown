                        PROCEEDINGS AT JOINT SITTING
                                    ____

Members of the National Assembly  and  the  National  Council  of  Provinces
assembled in the Chamber of the National Assembly at 14:02.

The Speaker took the Chair and requested members  to  observe  a  moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

WELCOMING ADDRESS  OF  PRESIDENT  STEPHANOPOULOS  OF  THE  REPUBLIC  OF  THE
HELLENIC

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, we are honoured to have with us  today  His
Excellency President  Stephanopoulos  of  the  Hellenic  Republic,  who  has
accepted our invitation to address this Joint Sitting. I now call  upon  the
hon Archie Lucas to introduce His Excellency to you.

Mr G A LUCAS: Madam Speaker, Chairperson of the NCOP, hon President  of  the
Republic of South Africa, His Excellency Thabo Mbeki, hon President  of  the
Republic of the Hellenic, His  Excellency  Constantine  Stephanopoulos,  hon
Deputy  President  Jacob  Zuma,  hon  speakers  from  various   legislatures
assembled here today, hon  Ministers  and  Deputy  Ministers,  distinguished
guests accompanying the hon President of the Republic of the  Hellenic,  and
hon members of Parliament.

Having been graced by the presence of President Constantine  Stephanopoulos,
on behalf of our democratic Parliament,  I  would  like  to  extend  a  warm
welcome to a free and democratic South Africa to  His  Excellency  President
Stephanopoulos. For granting South Africa this privilege, I  would  like  to
assure him that our people will usher him in  with  true  hospitality,  care
and love.

President Stephanopoulos was born in 1926 in Patras - I was  very  young  at
the time, probably not even born yet. [Laughter.]  He  studied  law  at  the
University of Athens, and upon completion he practised as a  lawyer  in  the
city of Patras from 1954 to  1974.  His  political  involvement  started  as
early as 1964 - I was still not born yet ...  [Laughter]  ...  when  he  was
first elected to the Greek parliament  under  the  banner  of  the  National
Radical Union Party, representing the region of Arcachia.

He was subsequently elected as a deputy of  the  New  Democracy  Party  from
1974 until 1985. In  August  1985  President  Stephanopoulos  left  the  New
Democracy Party and became the founding member  of  the  Democratic  Renewal
Party in September of the same year. After four  years  he  was  elected  to
parliament under the banner of the Democratic Renewal Party.

Whilst in the National Radical Union  Party,  hon  President  Stephanopoulos
assumed numerous government  responsibilities  after  the  collapse  of  the
military regime in 1974. He has served as the under-secretary  for  commerce
in the government of national  unity,  minister  of  interior,  minister  of
social services and, finally, minister to the prime minister  until  October
1981.

After  the  elections  for  the  European  Parliament  in  June  1994,   the
Democratic Renewal Party was  subsequently  dissolved,  and  Mr  Constantine
Stephanopoulos withdrew from political activism until he was called upon  to
assume his new responsibilities as President of  the  Republic  of  Hellenic
after the elections of 8 March 1995. On 8 February 2000  he  was  re-elected
as President of the Republic  of  Hellenic,  whose  term  runs  until  2005.
President Stephanopoulos  has  been  awarded  the  highest  of  honours  and
decorations from numerous states. Lastly, the President has two sons  -  who
might be older than I am - and one daughter.

Once more, I welcome President Constantine Stephanopoulos to  South  Africa.
It is our firm belief that his visit to our country will cement and  further
improve relations between our countries. We are confident  that  this  visit
will further  contribute  positively  to  the  process  of  our  continental
renewal, led by the African  Union  and  further  strengthened  by  the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development - Nepad.

It is our firm belief that this  century  must  and  shall  be  the  African
century, and only through his ongoing support and interest  in  the  African
continent can we, indeed, deliver Africa from the shackles of  poverty  into
prosperity and a  better  life  for  all.  We  thank  him  for  gracing  our
Parliament with his presence, and may he feel at home. [Applause.]

     ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF HELLENIC

Madam Speaker of the National Assembly, Chairperson of the National  Council
of Provinces, His Excellency the President of the Republic of South  Africa,
Mr Thabo Mbeki, hon members of Parliament, it is a great honour  for  me  to
have this opportunity to address the Parliament of South Africa,  for  which
I have deep respect.

Parliament as an institution is, in my view and indeed in reality, the  most
important and purest  expression  of  democracy,  and  the  only  system  of
government worthy of man. It is in parliament  that  ideas  are  freely  and
creatively debated  on  an  equal  basis,  and  this  constitutes  the  most
important characteristic of a democratic political system.

Not only is it an honour, but it is also a great  pleasure  to  be  in  this
great country, so endowed with natural beauty  and  friendly  people.  Among
them are the members of the Greek community, which has already been  present
here for more than a century and has experienced,  with  true  satisfaction,
together with the  rest  of  the  people  of  South  Africa,  the  peaceful,
democratic rebirth of this country during the past decade.

This Parliament represents a people that is demonstrably  committed  to  the
principles of peaceful,  dignified  and  enterprising  co-existence  between
different ethnic groups and religions, a people for whom the  protection  of
the global values of freedom and democracy is a priority.
It is true this great country has encountered serious  difficulties  on  the
road to freedom, equality and  justice.  However,  the  hard  struggles  and
heroic  sacrifices  necessary  for  the  success  of  this  country's  great
endeavours have borne valuable fruit and have made South Africa a source  of
inspiration to the whole world. Having managed to completely heal in such  a
wonderful way the wounds left by a hard and divisive past,  this  Parliament
has been able to make this country a pioneer of development on  the  African
continent.

Today South Africa enjoys general recognition as a leader and  a  factor  of
stability in this part of the world. The  creation  of  the  African  Union,
with South  Africa  the  first  country  to  hold  the  presidency  of  this
organisation, is proof of this country's role in the development  effort  of
the whole continent. The  appeal  of  South  Africa's  initiatives  in  this
framework, especially in relation to the proper  use  of  natural  resources
and the effective protection of  the  environment,  is  underscored  by  the
enthusiastic reception to President Thabo Mbeki's initiative called the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development.

The successful organisation of the World Conference Against  Racism,  Racial
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban  last  year  as
well as the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in  Johannesburg,
constitute additional proof  of  the  role  South  Africa  plays  in  global
issues.

Although geographically they are not neighbours,  Greece  and  South  Africa
are linked by their common attitude in  respect  of  international  law  and
legal order, the inviolability of  international  borders,  the  defence  of
human rights and, last but not least, the implementation of  United  Nations
resolutions. [Applause.]

In relation to the latter, I believe that both our countries  recognise  the
important role that the United Nations plays in international  matters,  its
contribution to date and its great potential in  seeking  solutions  to  the
many issues of  our  world.  The  United  Nations  must  be  given  all  the
necessary  powers  to  contribute  to  the   settlement   of   all   chronic
international problems, among which, as hon members are certainly aware,  is
the problem of the continued occupation of part of the Republic of Cyprus.

Greece lies between Europe and Africa, and Asia is a  natural  link  between
the neighbouring areas of these continents. As a result  of  this  strategic
position, our country suffers more  than  others  the  consequences  of  the
crises in our wider region. We are therefore obliged to contribute  as  much
as possible to their settlement.

As a member of the European Union and of Nato, Greece always tried, and  has
succeeded, in maintaining very close relations with  the  countries  of  its
neighbourhood in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Caucasus, in order  to
play, to the extent that is possible, a constructive and balancing role.

I believe I can say with certainty that  the  development  and  progress  of
humanity constitute a common and basic goal of  all  democratic  governments
and, of course, of both our countries. Nevertheless, besides  our  unanimous
stand for progress and our persevering effort to achieve it,  the  obstacles
are far from having  been  overcome,  which  obstacles  are  caused  by  the
negative elements of our contemporary societies.

The tragic events of 11 September in  New  York  and  Washington,  and  also
recently in Bali and Moscow, have shown that modern democracies  should  not
be complacent. On the contrary, they should be vigilant in order to  protect
what people have struggled to achieve. Terrorism is  a  global  threat  that
can only be countered by the  joint  efforts  of  all  democratic  countries
within the framework of international law, and by eradicating its causes.

Another plague that the new century has inherited from the previous  one  is
poverty, which brings with it criminality and the scourge  of  transmittable
diseases.  Many  countries  of   the   beautiful   African   continent   are
unfortunately suffering from poverty and its consequences. The economic  and
social development of Africa is important, not only to its inhabitants,  but
also to all of us - the whole world.

We live in the era of globalisation. Its main characteristics are the  speed
of communications, a worldwide  market  and  the  freedom  of  transactions.
Nevertheless,  alongside  the  obvious  advantages  of  globalisation,   the
marginalisation of a great part of the world's population  proves  that  the
system has failed to provide satisfactory  answers  to  a  number  of  major
problems which concern a large part of our planet.

The prosperous cannot continue to prosper while the unfortunate continue  to
live in misfortune. [Applause.] We must strive to seek  solutions  to  these
vital problems. We must open up our minds and use our imagination  in  order
to find ways to effectively relieve  the  burdened  economies  and  smoothly
integrate these countries into the global production and trade practices.
We must find ways to facilitate  these  countries'  ability  to  sell  their
products and to relieve them of their excessive  debt.  Global  co-operation
should promote social justice and prosperity for all mankind,  a  task  that
is the responsibility mainly of the developed economies.  Only  by  bridging
the gap between the rich and the poor will it  be  possible  for  peace  and
security to prevail on earth. This is our duty to future generations. It  is
necessary to show more understanding, greater solidarity  and  certainly  to
provide more financial resources to the countries in need.

Our country, a member of the European Union, is  happy  about  the  constant
strengthening of the bonds between  South  Africa  and  the  European  Union
through the Agreement on Trade, Development and Co-operation. Greece,  which
will hold the presidency of the European Union during the first semester  of
next year, will try to be  instrumental  in  making  sure  that  the  second
European Union-Africa Summit of next year in April gives further impetus  to
the co-operation between the two sides, thereby bringing about benefits  for
the whole African continent. [Applause.]

Greece believes in the idea of a united  Europe  and  is  convinced  of  the
necessity of its enlargement. The introduction of  a  single  currency,  the
euro, is of historic importance. It will contribute  decisively  to  further
economic growth, and it will facilitate trade  and  price  stability.  There
is, nevertheless, another important goal for  Europe  to  be  achieved:  the
adoption of a common foreign and defence policy.  This  new  dimension  will
allow the European  Union  to  play  a  more  active  role  collectively  in
international affairs, not only economically, but  also  politically,  which
will serve its great noble ideals and its fundamental principles.

Tomorrow, continuing with my visit in this beautiful country, I  shall  take
the tour of Robben Island, the place where human courage and  a  desire  for
dignity, equality, justice and freedom have proven that they can neither  be
imprisoned nor fettered in any way. [Applause.] A few months ago I  had  the
opportunity of welcoming unofficially former President Mandela,  and  I  was
able to assure him of the great respect that the Greek people have for  him,
something which he himself also witnessed.

 Let me, once more, express my  deepest  esteem  for  the  people  of  South
Africa and honour the victims of the struggle for  freedom  from  apartheid.
[Applause.] Looking at the future, I remain certain that Africa, with  South
Africa as the pioneer, has entered the new millennium in a dynamic way,  and
that it will continue to advance  steadily  on  the  road  to  progress  and
prosperity. [Applause.]

                               VOTE OF THANKS

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, Chairperson of the NCOP, His  Excellency  the
hon President of South Africa, President Mbeki, the  hon  President  of  the
Hellenic  Republic,  President  Stephanopoulos,  Deputy  President,   Deputy
Chairperson of the NCOP, Ministers,  members  of  Parliament,  distinguished
guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed  a  privilege  for  me  today  to
thank the hon President Stephanopoulos.

We are privileged to have such a distinguished person in  our  midst.  South
Africa has enjoyed an excellent  relationship  with  his  country  over  the
years, and there are very strong  ties  between  our  countries.  The  Greek
community in South Africa numbers some 50 000 to 60 000 people,  and  it  is
to our advantage that the Greek government  has  encouraged  this  community
not to leave, but rather to play a positive and constructive  role  wherever
possible in South Africa, as they have done and continue to do.

Direct investment from Greece in South Africa is estimated  at  some  US$350
million, and this rises to an estimated US$750  million  if  investments  by
Greek expatriates are taken into account. These  investments  are  estimated
to have created approximately 100 000 job  opportunities  in  South  Africa.
Bilateral trade in our country has increased tremendously over the past  two
years, and certainly the tourism agreement that was signed in 1998 has  been
beneficial both to Greece and South Africa.

Whilst we have thousands of Greek countrymen  and  -women  residing  in  our
country, we also know that Greece  is  a  popular  tourist  destination  for
South Africans. We must not forget Greece has in its  midst  our  ambassador
and ex-parliamentarian Jannie Momberg - our loss is their gain.  [Applause.]
We are also aware and very appreciative of  the  development  aid  that  has
been made available to South Africa for specific projects.

We share many concerns, as His Excellency has  referred  to,  poverty  being
one of those concerns and something that we have really got to do  something
about. We look forward to the relationship we enjoy and we believe  that  it
will continue and strengthen in the future.

It has been a pleasure to have His Excellency in South Africa and  hear  him
speak. I am certain I speak for all when I say thank you to His  Excellency.
We wish him a pleasant stay. May he enjoy the rest  of  his  stay  in  South
Africa, and may he have a safe journey back  to  his  own  country.  We  are
certain he will want to return for another visit to  our  magnificent  South
Africa.  Sas  efcharistó,  Kyrié  Proéthre.  [Thank  you,   Mr   President].
[Applause.]

The Joint Sitting rose at 14:28.
