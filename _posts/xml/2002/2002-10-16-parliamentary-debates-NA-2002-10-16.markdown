                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr N J GOGOTYA: Chair, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  three South African  soldiers,  Thabani  Sydney  Mbele,  Phillip
           Mello and Petrus Potsane, died  during  an  airborne  extraction
           exercise at Rusizi River near Bujumbura in Burundi last  Friday;
           and


       (b)  that the fourth soldier, Kgokong Abram Huma, went missing during
           this training exercise;


  (2) expresses condolences to the families and  friends  of  the  deceased
       soldiers; and


  (3) reiterates its unwavering support for our soldiers who are on a peace-
       keeping mission in Burundi.

[Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Mr Chairman,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  I
shall move the following motion:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  in the 2000 elections voters in  large  numbers  voted  for  the
           creation of a strong alternative to the ANC; and


       (b)  the faith of many voters in the  democratic  system  is  damaged
           when representatives cross the floor for career  advancement  or
           for reasons which have nothing to do with principle;


  (2) believes that the best way to establish  the  current  views  of  the
       electorate and the voters themselves is to hold an election; and
  (3) resolves, in terms of section 50(1) of the Constitution, to  dissolve
       the National Assembly.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Chair, I give notice that I shall move  on  behalf  of  the
IFP  at  the  next  sitting  of  Parliament:  [Laughter.]   [Interjections.]
[Applause.]


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the establishment in South Africa of the Freedom Park Trust,
       which provides the deepest research arm into the origins of man,  his
       potentials and technological achievements on planet earth;


  (2) notes with appreciation the  research  findings  on  the  comparative
       experiences of the likes of Prof  Harriet  Ngubane  and  other  world
       figures in this regard, which date back more than three billion years
       ago; and


  (3) calls on all visionaries, Dr Serote included, to continuously  deepen
       their minds in search of the  unknown  until  the  intended  outcome,
       which is the closure of the chapter on  human  sufferings,  conflicts
       and tribulations, is achieved in our lifetime.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Mr Chairperson, I am very glad that this  bad  loser  from
the DA is back in the House so that I can tell him the following, because  I
want to move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Constitutional Court ruled in favour  of  floor-crossing  at
           the local government level on 4 October 2002;


       (b)  following this ruling, the Democratic Alliance processes of self-
           destruction have been expressed through  the  crossing  over  of
           many DA councillors in the City of Cape Town to the  ANC/New  NP
           alliance; and


       (c)  the defection from the DA has been evident in other parts of the
           country as well;
  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the death-knell of the  DP  is  a  reflection  of  a  principled
           rejection of racial divisions and racial stereotypes perpetuated
           by Tony Leon and his ilk; and


       (b)  the crossing of the floor  from  the  Democratic  Alliance,  the
           ``Death'' Alliance, represents an overwhelming support  for  the
           ANC/New NP partnership to build national unity and  development,
           and to fight poverty; and


  (3) congratulates all the popular representatives who left the Democratic
       Alliance and joined the partnership for national  unity,  change  and
       development in South Africa.

[Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall  move
on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes the latest media gimmick by the hon Leader of  the  Opposition,
       Tony Leon, in calling for a general election immediately;


  (2) also notes that this is just an attempt to cover up the DP/DA's  loss
       of hundreds of councillors and the majority of DA-controlled councils
       over the past couple of days;


  (3) acknowledges the hypocrisy of the hon Leon,  because  not  only  have
       they supported this legislation, but for years they have been at  the
       forefront of arguing for this legislation, and the hon  Leon  himself
       begged  Deputy  President  Zuma  for   the   introduction   of   such
       legislation; and


  (4) believes that the hon Leon should -


       (a)  rather apologise for supporting  legislation  that  he  and  his
           party are now discrediting because they  are  at  the  receiving
           end; and


       (b)  realises that it is ludicrous to call  for  a  general  election
           which will cost the taxpayers millions of rands, just  to  prove
           that his support is dwindling.

[Applause.]

Ms N C NKABINDE: Mr Chair, I shall move on behalf of the  UDM  at  the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the news that a local  pharmaceutical  company,  Aspen,  has
       successfully negotiated with an international company  to  produce  a
       generic version of Nevirapine locally;


  (2) notes that the generic version will be produced  at  a  substantially
       reduced cost, and that this drug will be available not only for South
       Africa, but for export to 13 other countries in the region;


  (3) salutes the  efforts  of  the  many  South  African  doctors,  health
       professionals and the private sector who have proven their  full  and
       unequivocal commitment to treating people living with HIV/Aids; and
  (4) calls upon the national Government to stop delaying the full  rollout
       of antiretroviral treatment in public hospitals, so that we can start
       saving the lives of the millions of infected South Africans.

[Applause.]

Ms N R NTSHULANA-BHENGU: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Banyana Banyana powered  their  way  into  the  African  Women's
           Championships in Nigeria to  be  held  next  month  with  a  4-0
           victory over Zambia; and


       (b)  this win in front of a large and buoyant  crowd  of  the  team's
           home supporters gave Banyana Banyana an 8-1 aggregate  win  over
           their opponents;


  (2) congratulates Banyana Banyana on this convincing victory; and


  (3)  wishes  the  team  the  best  of  luck  in   the   African   Women's
       Championships.

[Applause.]

Ms M A SEECO: Chairperson, on behalf of the UCDP, I hereby move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Boksburg police managed to arrest two  men  on  Sunday
       for indecent behaviour at Wild Waters Resort, and for touching  girls
       inappropriately at the swimming pools; and


  (2) congratulates Captain Thobile Xakeka on behalf of the Boksburg police
       for exercising the child protection we are emphasising.

[Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, I shall give notice on the next sitting day  of
the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the PAC's deep concern about daily evictions of  the  poor  and
       landless from land they live on, without their  being  provided  with
       appropriate alternative land or accommodation;


  (2) acknowledges that this causes more suffering to people who  are  poor
       and powerless and who have no means to challenge their evictions from
       land in court;


  (3) notes that the PAC supports the Western Cape Anti-Eviction  Campaign,
       which involves hundreds of  Khayelitsha  residents  who  will  gather
       outside the Mitchell's Plain Magistrates Court tomorrow,  17  October
       2002;


  (4) also notes that the PAC is disturbed that transformation increasingly
       means conforming to the  previous  Group  Areas  Act  of  the  former
       apartheid regime, where people were uprooted  from  land  inhumanely;
       and


  (5) once again urges a just solution to the  land  question  by  amending
       section 25(7) of the Constitution.

Mr A MLANGENI: Comrade Chair, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the ANC held a Policy Review Conference on  27  -  30  September
           2002 in Johannesburg;


       (b)  this conference was a culmination of  months  of  discussion  in
           branches, regions and provinces of the  ANC  to  review  current
           policies and chart a framework for the  strategic  direction  of
           our programme for change which will  be  endorsed  in  the  51st
           National Conference in December 2002; and


       (c)  this  important  conference  confirmed  the  ANC-led  Government
           policies as appropriate in providing a strategic  framework  for
           social and economic transformation in our country;


  (2) believes that this historic event reflects the commitment of the  ANC
       to democratic processes within its ranks, and to the  achievement  of
       this noble objective in society as a whole; and


  (3) welcomes the draft resolutions of the ANC National Policy Conference.

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Ek gee hiermee kennis  dat  ek  sal  voorstel  namens  die
DA/DP:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  ons die Grondwet alle  amptelike  tale  beskerm,  wat  Afrikaans
           insluit; en


       (b)  die  Minister  van  Onderwys,  een  van  die  Nuwe  NP  se  nuwe
           kampvegters, Kader Asmal, uitgevaar het  teen  die  voorstanders
           van Afrikaans as universiteitstaal op  Stellenbosch  deur  hulle
           uit te kryt as diegene  ``that  still  uphold  the  ideology  of
           superiority'';


  (2) besef dat die ANC se aandrang op slaafse onderdanigheid die regte  in
       die Grondwet bedreig; en


  (3)  die  ANC/Nuwe  NP-alliansie  se  vermoë  bevraagteken  om  ooit  die
       behoeftes van die meerderheid kiesers in Stellenbosch, of  selfs  die
       Wes-Kaap, ten opsigte van taal te kan verteenwoordig.[Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN: Mr Chairman, on behalf of the  DP  I  hereby  give  notice
that on the next sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  our Constitution protects all the official languages,  and  this
           includes Afrikaans; and


       (b)  the Minister of Education, one of the New  NP's  new  champions,
           Kader Asmal, railed at the advocates of Afrikaans as  university
           language at Stellenbosch by  denouncing  them  as  those  ``that
           still uphold the ideology of superiority'';


  (2) realises that the ANC's insistence on slavish subservience  threatens
       the rights in the Constitution; and


  (3) questions the ability of the ANC/New NP alliance of ever  being  able
       to represent the needs of the majority of voters in Stellenbosch,  or
       even the Western Cape, with regard to language. [Applause.]]

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Chairman, I shall give notice on behalf of the IFP at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  that  the  CPIX  inflation  figure  has  increased  more  than
       expected;


  (2) wishes to point out that the increase in the consumer price index  is
       not directly related to interest rates and money supply;


  (3) cautions that a further increase in the repo rate would be even  more
       detrimental to the country; and


  (4) believes that a further increase will lead to further job losses  and
       the curtailment of economic growth.

Mr M H FAZZIE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Mrs Mabel  Notancu  Timakwe,  the  sister  of  the  former
       President Mandela, passed away last night in Qunu, Eastern Cape;


  (2) expresses heartfelt condolences to Comrade Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela,
       the family of the deceased and friends; and


  (3) joins the Timakwe and Mandela families in mourning for the deceased.

May her soul rest in peace!

[Applause.]

           NEW CHAIRPERSON: HRC AND COMMISSION ON GENDER EQUALITY

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Chairperson,  I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister for Justice and  Constitutional  Development,
       honourable Penuell Maduna, announced that Mr Jody Kollapen  had  been
       appointed as Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission and Ms  Joyce
       Piliso-Seroke as Chairperson of the Commission for Gender Equality;
  (2) believes that these patriots will provide the necessary leadership to
       these  institutions  and  will  make  a  positive   contribution   to
       strengthening democracy;


  (3) congratulates Ms Joyce Piliso-Seroke and Mr Jody  Kollapen  on  their
       appointments; and


  (4) wishes them and the  institutions  supporting  democracy  which  they
       chair every success in their mission.

            ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION OF ROAD TRAFFIC OFFENCES

                               AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading Debate)

Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, I rise on a point of order. The point  of  order
is as follows: the Bill that we are now going to discuss is a Bill  amending
the main Act on road traffic offences. The problem is that the Bill that  is
in front of the House is printed  in  two  languages,  namely,  English  and
isiZulu, in accordance with constitutional rules. The point I am  making  is
not with regard to  the  languages  themselves,  but  to  the  principle  in
general with regard to the language situation in Parliament.

The problem is that the main Act, Act 46 of 1998, that we are  now  amending
in terms of the process this afternoon, is still in two  languages,  namely,
English and Afrikaans; English being the official text,  and  the  Afrikaans
being the official translation. Again, I am not talking about  the  specific
languages.

The problem is that we have a situation, as regards the department  and  the
portfolio committee, that the amending Bill is now  again  in  English,  but
that the other language is different to the one in  the  original  Act.  The
practical implication is this: When the process goes through Parliament,  in
the end, we will have an isiZulu translation of the amending Bill that  does
not make sense at all on its own, because there is no main Act  in  isiZulu.
The original official translation in Afrikaans will become useless,  because
there is no official translation in Afrikaans of the amending Bill.

The practical implication in the end would be that there would only  be  one
official version, which would be the English version. The  problem  is  that
by accepting this procedure, even though the Joint Rules make provision  for
this in Rules 220 to 222, the  process  leads  us  to  the  unconstitutional
position where  we  would  be  in  contravention  of  section  6(3)  of  the
Constitution  that  expects  Parliament  to  use  at  least   two   official
languages.

Although the process can go ahead, there are practical  language  situations
which cause this problem, and it leads Parliament into  an  unconstitutional
position. If the Chair would like to study this with  regard  to  the  whole
language issue and  come  back  to  us  on  this  at  some  stage,  I  would
appreciate that.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, can I suggest that we raise  this
issue in the Rules Committee meeting which will be sitting in the  next  few
days? I think it is a matter for debate in that  particular  committee,  and
we can then continue with this debate and you can raise it there.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Thank you,  Chairperson.  Road  Traffic
management comprises many functional areas. To be effective in road  traffic
management the various functional areas have to  operate  efficiently  in  a
system.  The  effectiveness  of  the  law  enforcement  relies  heavily   on
successful adjudication  of  road  traffic  offences.  At  the  moment,  the
adjudication of  traffic  offences  is  not  the  highest  priority  in  the
judicial system. Many traffic offences  are  not  brought  to  finality  and
there is a continuous downward trend in the finalisation of offences.

The result of the downward trend  is  that  the  possibility  of  successful
prosecution of traffic offences is ever  decreasing.  This  is  one  of  the
major factors that has a detrimental  effect  on  law  enforcement  efforts.
Another important factor influencing traffic law enforcement  negatively  is
the fines. Fines differ vastly from one jurisdictional area  to  the  other,
causing frustration among road users and law enforcement officials. In  many
cases, the  fine  does  not  befit  the  crime  that  was  committed,  which
particularly in the case of low fines, has a further detrimental  effect  on
the traffic law enforcement.

There is no proper record keeping of previous  traffic  offences,  therefore
each traffic offender is almost always treated  as  a  first  offender.  The
current system is therefore open to  fraud  and  corruption.  This  must  be
addressed in a very firm and effective manner. To improve the current  state
of affairs, the Department  of  Transport  has  started  to  develop  a  new
system, namely the Administrative Adjudication of  Record  Traffic  Offences
System.

This Act was published in the Government Gazette of 11 September  1998.  The
Act provides for the establishment of the Road Traffic  Infringement  Agency
through which offences will be administratively adjudicated. The  objectives
of  the  agency  are:  to  administer  a   procedure   to   discourage   the
contravention  of  road  traffic  laws,  to  support  the  adjudication   of
infringements; to enforce penalties  imposed  against  persons  contravening
road traffic laws; to provide specialised prosecution support services;  and
to undertake community  education  and  community  awareness  programmes  in
order to ensure that individuals understand their rights and options.

Systems used in other countries to collect fines were researched before  the
South  African  AARTO  was  developed.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  debt-
collecting agencies overseas achieved success rates in collecting  fines  of
more than 90%. The concept is so successful that  the  collection  of  other
outstanding debt is also done  through  such  agencies.  Amendments  to  the
Administrative  Adjudication  of  Road  Traffic  Offences  Act,  1988,  will
further improve the Act.

The amendment Bill provides for the offender to have an option of the  right
to be heard in a court of law, while serious offences must  be  heard  in  a
court of law. A definition was inserted for a representation officer,  while
a credit card driving licence is in terms of the amendment  Bill  acceptable
identification. The Act previously referred to national and provincial  laws
only, but now municipal laws have also been included.

On an institutional level the problem identified is  that  the  Act  is  not
flexible enough to allow a board comprising members  from  a  public  sector
only. It  forces  a  specific  representation  by  the  public  and  private
sectors. The flexibility  has  now  been  built  into  the  amendment  Bill.
Membership of the board has been increased from five  to  seven.  Previously
the Act mandated the registrar to recommend to the Minister of Justice  that
sheriffs  or  deputy  sheriffs  be  appointed.  The  amendment  Bill   makes
provision for  the  Minister  of  Transport,  after  consultation  with  the
registrar, to  make  recommendation  to  the  Minister  of  Justice  on  the
appointment of sheriffs and deputy sheriffs  so  as  to  ensure  the  proper
performance of the agency's functions.

The period within which the fines should be paid was increased from 28  days
to 32 days. A further concession was that fines  and  other  costs,  if  any
could be paid, in instalments. Offenders will be notified  in  a  prescribed
manner of the number  of  demerit  points  recorded  against  their  crimes.
Previously, a representation officer had only two options, namely,  to  find
the infringer guilty or not guilty.

The amendment Bill now mandates the  representation  officer  to  refer  the
infringer to a court of law, should the representation  officer  be  of  the
opinion that a court  hearing  may  be  beneficial  to  bring  the  case  to
finality. The amendment Bill furthermore stipulates clearly what  course  of
action should be followed in the case of payment being  dishonoured  or  not
made.

The  amendment  Bill  further  specifies  the  responsible  entity  for  the
recording of demerit points, and the surrendering of revoked  documents.  If
revoked documents are not surrendered, the offender  will  be  guilty  of  a
serious offence. The amendment Bill also makes provision for the case of  an
infringer who opted to go to court, but  did  not  appear  in  court  to  be
finalised administratively.

It also provides  road  users  the  opportunity  to  access  their  personal
records of demerit points upon the payment of the  prescribed  fine.  It  is
currently planned that the Act will  start  functioning  during  April  2003
when the computer system  will  be  ready.  The  institutional  mobilisation
precedes  the  functional  mobilisation  and  has  already  started   before
September 2002. [Applause.]

Mr  J  P  CRONIN:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  members,  the  original
Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act was passed in  this
House way back in 1998. Unfortunately AARTO, the Act, and  the  institutions
that supported specifically the Road Traffic  Infringement  Agency  and  its
board, have  not  yet  been  established.  As  a  portfolio  committee,  and
certainly as its ANC component,  we  have  enthusiastically  contributed  to
moving this amendment Bill  rapidly  through  the  committee  stage  in  the
belief and fervent hope that we are now clearing  the  way  to  getting  the
AARTO system up and running as soon as possible. I was pleased to  hear  the
hon Minister saying that this will be done by April 2003.

Since it is now some four years since the passing of the  original  Act,  it
may be useful to remind ourselves and the public of some of  the  underlying
background principles and objectives of this Act that we  are  now  amending
in a few minor and technical ways.

Law enforcement is obviously clearly critical to the overall  management  of
our road traffic system.  The  effectiveness  of  law  enforcement  depends,
amongst other things, on effective adjudication of traffic offences. But,  I
suppose for understandable reasons, traffic offences  are  not  the  highest
priority in our often overburdened judicial system.

There  has  been  a  dramatic  and  very  worrying  deterioration   in   the
finalisation of road traffic offences. Finalisation  of  these  offences  in
terms of the Criminal Procedures Act dropped in the case of spot fines  from
75% in 1989 to a pathetic 25% in 1997. In the case  of  summonses  with  the
option of a fine, these dropped from 72% in 1989 to  51%  in  1997.  In  the
case of summons to appear in court, 71% in 1989 down to 25% in 1997. We  are
quoting figures from 1997 because that is the last year for which  there  is
comprehensive  data.  However,  according  to  the  national  Department  of
Transport, there is  enough  evidence,  in  their  words,  to  suggest  this
downward  trend  in  finalising  cases   involving   traffic   offences   is
continuing.

There are many inter-related problems and anomalies.  As  the  Minister  has
said,  fines  differ  vastly  from  one  area  to  another,   which   causes
frustration amongst drivers and especially amongst law  enforcers.  In  some
cases the fines are pathetically low and bear no resemblance to the  offence
committed. There is no proper  record-keeping  and  therefore  each  traffic
offender in virtually every case is treated as a first offender,  regardless
of the track record.

Because of the enormous variations and inconsistencies  and  the  fact  that
often a traffic fine becomes a matter of bargaining on the spot, the  system
is open to enormous fraud, corruption and abuse.  Against  this  background,
the original AARTO system we are now slightly amending  seeks  to  establish
standard  national  penalties  for  specified  offences.  So  there  is   no
negotiation or arbitrariness about it.
It seeks to encourage offenders in the case of  infringements,  not  serious
criminal infringements, to have their cases dealt with not  in  the  courts,
but  through  an  alternative   and   less   expensive   and   more   speedy
administrative  system.  It  seeks  to   provide,   nonetheless,   for   the
constitutional right to be heard in a court of law if the alleged  infringer
wants to persist in that route. Finally, it provides for  a  demerit  points
system.

Depending on the severity of the infringement or the  offence,  up  to  four
demerit points can be given for a single offence. There is  a  threshold  of
12 demerit points and when these 12 demerit points are exceeded,  a  driving
licence,  professional  driving  permit  or  an  operator's  card  will   be
suspended. A third  suspension  will  result  in  the  cancellation  of  the
licence.

There is also a provision for good  behaviour  to  prevent  one  from  being
stuck at 12 demerit points for the rest of one's life. Demerit  points  will
diminish one per every three months of an offence-free period. What is  also
very important in the conceptualisation of AARTO is that  while  drivers  of
public transport and freight transport vehicles and so  on  will  be  issued
with demerit points themselves personally for offences,  provision  is  also
made for joint responsibility with operators for offences such as  speeding,
overloading and unroadworthiness which are often caused  by  bad  management
or pressures put  by  operators  onto  drivers  themselves.  Operators  will
therefore also receive demerit points for offences of that kind.

Finally, the whole system depends on effective national  information-keeping
so that we should be able to keep track of people are repeat  offenders  and
of what the demerit points situation is. Therefore, this depends on  getting
the National Traffic Information System up and running.

In conclusion, we are not just dealing narrowly with road  offences.  It  is
important to understand that we are trying through Arrive Alive,  AARTO  and
its amendments, the Road to South African Safety, to cultivate and foster  a
different attitude towards the public spaces that  we  all  share,  such  as
roads. It  is  very  important  to  encourage  different  social  behaviour.
Hopefully, AARTO and its implementation will contribute towards doing  this.
The ANC obviously supports the amendments to the AARTO Act.

Mr S B FARROW: Mr Chairperson, the original Act, which was  assented  to  in
1998, had very good intentions. It was proclaimed in order to  promote  road
traffic quality by  providing  for  a  scheme  to  discourage  road  traffic
contraventions  and  to  facilitate  the  adjudication   of   road   traffic
infringements, while supporting the prosecution  of  offences  in  terms  of
national and provincial laws through the introduction of the demerit  system
administered by the board.

Since 1998 much water has gone under the bridge, so to  speak.  Firstly,  we
have new municipalities and metros whose laws now  have  to  be  taken  into
consideration. The new smart card drivers' licence was also introduced,  and
we have this national contraventions register which was updated and  brought
in line to ensure that offenders  were  brought  to  book,  irrespective  of
where the offence took place.

This process, despite having taken a number of years to come into  effect  -
and it still has not really been finally sorted out - has effectively  meant
that some of our  members,  including  myself,  have  really  witnessed  the
effect of this when we tried to relicense our vehicles without  having  paid
outstanding fines.
We also had a situation whereby infringers were not being informed of  their
rights and, where they had failed to  comply,  they  were  issued  with  the
necessary warnings before executing a warrant against them, if  they  failed
to appear in court or to pay the fine.

Although I am not sure that the Road Traffic Infringement  Agency  was  able
to deliver on the service, it  certainly  deserves  our  support.  The  Bill
before us required amendments to some 23 sections of the  original  Act  and
can be fully justified, but only if we are going to  be  serious  about  the
efficiency of our traffic management.

The DP, therefore, supported the amendments in the portfolio committee  and,
in particular, the need to increase the numbers, the representation and  the
competency of the board, with the proviso that the portfolio  committee  was
kept advised of these appointments. This inclusion was  done,  not  to  give
the Minister more work, but to ensure  that,  as  parliamentarians,  we  can
hold the Minister, who makes these appointments,  accountable  and  that  we
can effectively play the oversight role that we were elected to do.

The original Act is quite clear about the functions of  the  board  and  its
agencies. With the amendment before us, hopefully, the DA can look  forward,
in years to come, to improvements in the downward trend of traffic  offences
not brought  to  finality.  At  the  moment,  the  adjudication  of  traffic
offences is not the highest of priorities in the judicial  system,  and  the
current system is open to fraud and corruption.

The agency and its board have a major role to play in this  regard,  as  the
Act requires them to provide both training and law enforcement equipment  to
authorise officers, prosecutors and issuing authorities, and  I  trust  that
they will take this part of their role more seriously.

The amendments are not about improving the systems of  fine  collections  by
allowing offenders to pay fines  within  a  32-day  period  and  prescribing
options for the payment of fines by instalments as opposed to having  to  go
to court. It  is  about  the  effectiveness  of  law  enforcement  and  zero
tolerance.

All in all, the amendments of the Act should  greatly  improve  the  current
state of affairs, and at the same time honour the constitutional  rights  of
those offenders who are not properly administered to  by  the  Act  and  who
wish to be heard in a court of law. Unfortunately, demerit  points  will  be
applicable to all traffic offences in future, but good behaviour  will  also
be taken into  account.  This  will  entail  proper  record-keeping  and  an
effective database in order for it to work efficiently.

The DA would like to encourage the Minister to get the AARTO system  working
as soon as possible in order that evaders and habitual  offenders  meet  the
full wrath of the law, and in so doing, bring about a  fair,  equitable  and
uniform system of penalties throughout South Africa. Only this will be  able
to bring about respect for and control over the lack of law  enforcement  in
our country which kills, maims and injures thousands of  people  every  year
on our roads.

The DP supports the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Mr Chairperson, I think that most of the  members  in  this
House would agree with me that the South African road users  are  among  the
worst in the world. Our  national  accident,  death  and  injury  statistics
appear to support this statement. It is, therefore, no surprise  that  South
African road users also excel at the number of road  traffic  offences  that
are committed annually, as is borne out by  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of
traffic tickets that are handed out by our law enforcement agencies.

The major problem is that the vast majority of  these  traffic  tickets  are
simply ignored by offenders, and the authorities do not  have  the  capacity
to trace and impose further sanctions on these offenders.

Furthermore, traffic offences have for long been dealt with in terms of  the
Criminal Procedure Act, which has  led  to  a  situation,  as  said  by  the
Chairperson, where  only  25%  of  spot  fines  in  1997  were  successfully
finalised. In the case of summonses to appear in court again,  only  25%  of
cases were successfully finalised in 1997.

Although no recent statistics are available,  the  Department  of  Transport
believes that the downward trend is continuing. The negative impact of  this
downward trend on effective law  enforcement  in  the  road  traffic  sector
cannot be overemphasised. The Minister and the Department of Transport  have
gone to great lengths to strengthen traffic law enforcement and road  safety
awareness, but their efforts will come to naught if  traffic  offenders  are
not prosecuted relentlessly and effectively.

The 1998 principal Act was designed  to  address  the  shortcomings  in  the
successful  prosecution  of  traffic   offenders   via   an   administrative
adjudication process that was supposed to address  the  obstacles  presented
by  the  criminal  justice  system  to  successful  prosecution  of  traffic
offences.

The Bill before us today aims to  further  streamline  the  process  and  to
strengthen the hand of the law enforcement  authorities  to  prosecute  road
traffic offenders quickly and effectively. The idea is a sound one and,  for
that reason, the IFP will support the Bill as a whole.

However, what we simply cannot  support  is  the  provision  that  offenders
will, in future, be able to pay off their fines in instalments. If the  idea
behind the principal Act  of  this  amendment  Bill  is  to  streamline  the
administrative  process  of  dealing  with  traffic  offences,   then   this
provision represents a backward step.

The required additional administrative capacity and  massive  administrative
problems associated with acting as a debt collecting agency will, no  doubt,
hinder the very situation the law  was  designed  to  deal  with,  in  other
words, speedy administrative adjudication of traffic offences.

We know that the authorities are experiencing massive problems with  traffic
offenders who have supplied false or fictitious addresses or names, and  who
have presented fraudulent licences and identity documents.  The  problem  in
this regard will be multiplied many times over, as the authorities will  now
also have to run after offenders who have defaulted  on  their  instalments,
who have fallen behind with their payments or who  have  simply  disappeared
without paying.

In the end, this provision will not achieve  the  desired  effect  and  will
only add to the already huge number of traffic offenders who  simply  ignore
tickets and summonses, and it will  amount  to  yet  another  body  blow  to
effective road traffic law enforcement.

Without relentless and competent law enforcement, South Africa will  not  at
any time soon solve the carnage on our roads.

Mnr J J NIEMANN: Mnr die Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP  steun  hierdie  wetgewing.
Ek wil graag uit 'n ander hoek die  gevolge  van  hierdie  wetgewing  belig.
Suid-Afrika het 'n lewenstryd om die dood van die pad af  te  hou.  Jaarliks
word miljoene rande bestee  aan  verskillende  veldtogte  om  inligting  oor
padveiligheid oor te dra,  onder  meer  bewusmaking  by  skole  en  allerlei
inrigtings. Feitlik daagliks lees ons van voetgangers wat doodgery  word  en
fietsryers wat sterf.

Elke dag is daar talle motors wat  betrokke  is  in  noodlottige  ongelukke,
busse wat om die een of ander rede van die  pad  af  loop,  en  talle  mense
sterf. Die Minister verwys selfs na sekere voertuie as doodskiste op  wiele.
Dwarsdeur die land is tienduisende matrikulante besig met hul  eindeksamens.
Talle is besig met die skryf van hul laaste eksamen van die  lewe,  want  na
die matriekeksamen begin die jollifikasie van die sogenaamde  grootmenswees.
Duisende jongmense trek saam op verskillende vergaderplekke waar jol  hoogty
vier. Dikwels word morele standaarde by die ouers agtergelaat, en  is  drank
en spoed met pa se kar of bakkie die paspoort tot die ewige lewe.

Hierdie  wetgewing  is  juis  daar  om  uiteindelik  'n  ommekeer   in   die
sterftesyfer op ons paaie te bring, en dit terug te bring na  internasionaal
aanvaarbare vlakke. Daardeur sal tienduisende lewens gespaar  word,  waarvan
duisende dié van hoogs opgeleide en professionele burgers is. Daar  sal  ook
biljoene in man-ure gespaar word in die arbeidswêreld.

Tans bestaan daar 'n kultuur om 'n mens nie te steur  aan  padveiligheid  of
verkeerswette nie, en gevolglik betaal die oortreders nie  die  boetes  nie,
of koop eenvoudig geregsdienaars om en verskyn bloot net  nie  in  die  howe
nie. Miskien  is  dit  ook  as  gevolg  van  die  feit  dat  die  regstelsel
verkeersoortredings nie  as  'n  baie  hoë  prioriteit  stel  nie.  Met  die
inwerkingstelling van hierdie wet sal die miskenning  en  traak-my-nieagtige
houding teenoor verkeersveiligheid en verkeerswette egte tot 'n  einde  kom.
Ek hoop so.

Ek wil 'n paar voorbeelde noem. Ons paaie sal uiteindelik vernietig word  as
gevolg van geweldige oorlading van vragvoertuie. Met dié  wet  sal  nie  net
die eienaar beboet word nie, maar ook die bestuurder. Albei sal  volgens  'n
puntestelsel benadeel word. As 'n  bestuurder  weer  gevang  word,  kan  dit
uiteindelik lei tot die opskorting van sy bestuurderslisensie, maar ook  die
eienaar kan sy permit om vrag te vervoer tydelik verloor.  Ook  diegene  wat
onpadwaardige voertuie besit of bestuur,  staar  dieselfde  strawwe  in  die
gesig,  maar  so  ook  die  ``smart  guy''  wat  dink  hy  kan  wegkom   met
verkeersoortredings. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J J NIEMANN: Mr Chairman, the New NP supports this legislation. I  would
like to view the effects of  this  legislation  from  another  angle.  South
Africa is involved in a life struggle to keep death off the roads.  Millions
of  rands  are  being  spent  annually  on  various  campaigns   to   convey
information on road safety, among others awareness campaigns at schools  and
all types of institutions. We read virtually  daily  about  pedestrians  who
are knocked over and killed and cyclists who die.

Every day many cars are involved in fatal accidents, buses  which  for  some
or other reason leave the road, and  many  people  die.  The  Minister  even
refers to certain vehicles as coffins on wheels. Throughout  the  land  tens
of thousands of matriculants are writing their final examinations. They  are
also writing the final exams  of  their  lives,  because  after  the  matric
examinations  the  revelry  of  so-called  adulthood  starts.  Thousands  of
youngsters get together at various places where the party runs  riot.  Often
moral standards are left behind with the parents, and  liquor  and  speeding
with dad's car or bakkie become the passport to eternal life.

This legislation is there particularly to bring  about  a  reversal  of  the
death rate on our roads by bringing  it  back  to  internationally  accepted
levels. In this way tens of thousands of lives will be spared, thousands  of
which are those of highly trained and  professional  citizens.  Billions  in
man-hours will also be saved in the labour market.

At present there is a culture of noncompliance with road safety and  traffic
laws, and therefore the offenders do not pay the fines  or  they  bribe  the
officers and simply do not appear in court.  It  may  also  be  because  the
judicial system does not regard traffic offences as  too  high  a  priority.
However, with the commencement of this law,  the  disregard  and  devil-may-
care attitude towards traffic safety and traffic laws could come to an  end.
I hope so.

I want to name a few examples. Our roads will  eventually  be  destroyed  by
the gross overloading of goods vehicles. With this law not only the  owners,
but also the drivers will be fined. Both will be prejudiced according  to  a
points system. If a driver is caught again, it could lead  to  the  eventual
suspension of his driver's licence, but the owner can also temporarily  lose
his licence to  haul  freight.  Those  who  possess  or  drive  unroadworthy
vehicles may face similar penalties, but the same applies to the  smart  guy
who thinks he can get away with traffic offences.]

Mr D G MKONO: Hon Minister and hon members, the Administrative  Adjudication
of  Road  Traffic  Offences  Amendment  Bill  aims  to   provide   for   the
determination of tariffs by the  Minister,  who  should  also  prescribe  an
extended period for payment of infringements and matters  related  to  that.
The Bill also aims to regulate the composition of  the  board  to  represent
and control the agency which comprises 5 persons appointed by the  Minister,
and who by virtue of their relevant experience and technical  expertise  are
suitably qualified to perform the functions of the agency under the Act.

The board may appoint  not  more  than  25  persons  as  deputy  registrars.
Section 2 of the principal Act promotes and encourages compliance  with  the
national, provincial and municipal laws relating  to  road  safety,  thereby
rewarding law-abiding behaviour by reducing demerit points where  they  have
been incurred if infringes or offences are not committed  over  a  specified
period. If a person incurs demerit points which are  recorded  against  that
person in the national contravention register,  and  those  points  are  not
reduced as contemplated in clause 28, but exceed the total  contemplated  in
clause 29(d), that person is disqualified - with effect from 32  days  after
such excess points have been incurred - from driving  or  operating  another
vehicle.

Whilst we welcome and support this effort, the  UDM  is  worried  about  the
acute shortage of traffic officers on our roads as  their  visibility  would
go a long way towards  discouraging  traffic  regulation  offenders  on  our
roads. The UDM would also like to  encourage  government  to  intensify  the
road safety education campaign in an  endeavour  to  curb  road  carnage  as
hundreds of thousands of commuters are losing their lives  day  in  and  day
out through negligence and reckless driving by taxis and bus operators.  The
UDM supports the Bill.

Mr S N SWART: Mr Chairman, this Bill seeks to regulate and increase  from  5
to 7 the composition of the Road  Traffic  Infringements  Agency  Board,  to
provide for the appointment of sheriffs to carry out the agency's  functions
and to prescribe an extended period for the payment of  infringement  fines.
Whilst the main objectives of such fines is not  to  swell  the  coffers  of
local authorities but  to  punish  road  users  for,  and  deter  them  from
committing traffic offences, it is undeniable  that  local  authorities  are
losing millions of rands due to nonpayment of  fines.  There  is  clearly  a
need to increase the capacity and numbers of sheriffs to serve  summons  and
execute warrants of arrest. It is  also  significant  that  where  a  person
incurs demerit points resulting in being disqualified  from  driving  for  a
third time, that person must hand in his driver's  licence  to  the  issuing
authority forthwith, and  failure  to  do  so  will  amount  to  a  criminal
offence.

The  ACDP  supports  the  amendment  Bill  and  trust  that  effective   law
enforcement will reduce the carnage and loss of lives that  we  see  on  our
roads.
Miss S RAJBALLY: Siyabonga ngegama lamakhosikazi! [Praise be to the name  of
women!]

Chairperson, the media have provided us with enough  coverage  of  the  high
rate of road accidents throughout South Africa. All hon members need  to  do
is listen to the radio guide on traffic congestion or watch Morning Live  to
note that the morning does not pass without there being an accident report.

It is even more unfortunate to  note  that  many  of  these  road  accidents
involve innocent, traffic-abiding and licensed drivers who  fall  victim  to
the negligent driving of another driver. Accidents do happen,  but  when  it
is the result of  negligence  and  other  irresponsible  reasons,  something
needs to be done about it. The Minority Front supports the need  to  put  in
place certain provisions to enable us to deal with  a  desperate  situation.
Lives are being claimed and even worse is  that  it  is  costing  the  state
money as well. The Minority Front does  compliment  the  department  on  the
increase, nicknamed the ``pizza boys'', that has increased sufficiently  the
performance of drivers on the road. They have  made  the  public  ...  [Time
expired].

Mdi H F MALEBANA: Mohlomphegi Modulasetulo, [Hon Chairperson]

Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Government for realising that  the
salaries  of  traffic  officers  have  to  be  improved.  This  will  reduce
corruption that always occurs on our roads.

[People want to be able to do  their  daily  chores  and  plan  their  lives
without any hassles, especially those caused by road accidents.

Road accidents cause havoc in people's lives and destabilise people's  lives
through unnecessary deaths and severe injuries. It  is  therefore  the  road
user's responsibility to see to it that he/she observes  the  rules  of  the
road. This calls for rules of road safety to be given a high priority.]

The Administrative Adjudication  of  Road  Traffic  Offences  Act  is  being
amended so as to regulate the composition of the board.  The  Minister  will
appoint five members who will include public  servants  with  expertise  and
experience in order to be able to  perform  their  duties.  In  consultation
with the  Minister,  the  National  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  will
nominate a Director of Public Prosecutions also to serve on the  board.  The
registrar of the agency and the board may appoint not more than  25  persons
to serve as deputy registrars in the provinces.

To ensure the proper performance of the agency's functions, the Minister  of
Transport, after consultation with  the  registrar,  may  recommend  to  the
Minister of Justice to appoint the sheriffs. The period  for  notifying  the
infringer is extended from 28 days to 32 days after the date of the  service
of the infringement.

paragraph follows.)

[The Act allows for the person who infringes it to be fined for  a  specific
number of days. In that case, the infringer can get a reduced fine, if  paid
on time.

The infringer can make arrangements with the magistrate to pay his/her  fine
in certain terms until he/she finishes. If the accused is unable to pay  the
fine, notification in a registered letter will be sent to him/her to  remind
him/her about the offence and that  he/she  is  behind  with  the  payments.
Failing that, a letter showing the urgency of payment will be sent.  If  all
that fails, the after effect will be that property will  be  attached,  like
what the Scorpions are  doing,  and  licences  withdrawn  or  licence  discs
removed from vehicles.]

If the infringer pays insufficient funds, or pays  with  a  cheque  that  is
dishonoured by the bank, the process of informing  him  or  her  must  start
again. This time the full amount owed must be paid within 32 days,  together
with the notice fee and including the  interest,  failing  which  a  warrant
will be issued against him or her and he or she will get the demerit  points
recorded in the national contraventions register.

The infringer on whom an enforcement order is served may pay  at  the  local
registering authority or at  a  drivers  testing  licence  centre.  If  this
happens, then the national contraventions register will be  updated  to  the
effect that a payment, with all  penalties,  has  been  received.  Then  the
infringer will be informed in a prescribed manner, that is, in writing.

If the enforcement order is revoked, the  national  contraventions  register
must be updated and the infringer must be informed accordingly  and  his  or
her driver's licence or the endorsement on the  identity  document  must  be
cancelled.

If all fails and there is still no compliance, then a summons may be  issued
in terms of the Criminal Procedure  Act  of  1977.  The  prosecutor  has  to
notify the issuing authority or the agency in writing of the outcome of  the
case if he declines to prosecute. The clerk of the  court  must  notify  the
agency that must update the national contraventions register, and this  time
no admission of guilt may be accepted.

bootledi. (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[If all that fails, the infringer receives  a  warrant  of  arrest,  and  if
points accumulated show some irresponsibility on the road,  his  licence  is
repossessed.]

The national contraventions register must indicate this. The infringer  must
hand in his or her licence to the authority for retention.

Motho yo a tshelago molao ka  go  otlela  koloi  ka  morago  ga  go  tšeelwa
mangwalo a bootledi o otlwa ka go golegwa goba go lefa goba a golegwe  a  be

[A person  who  drives  after  his  licence  has  been  repossessed  can  be
arrested, asked to pay or both. It is the responsibility of every  infringer
to go and check out whether he/she  has  gained  points  after  obeying  the
law.]

After the demerit points have been registered, a point  is  reduced  by  the
agency after every three months.

[All this is done with the intention to encourage people to obey  the  rules
and road signs, to emphasise the importance of co-operation on the road,  to
emphasise safety and to reduce the number of court cases.]

All this is possible if we all co-operate, if we do not speed or  drink  and
drive. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Mr Chairperson, I would like  to  thank
the hon members and all the parties who participated in this  discussion.  I
also thank them on behalf of Minister Omar, especially  for  the  fact  that
all the parties enthusiastically support the rule of law and would  like  to
see this legislation and these amendments going forward.

Indeed, this will go a long way towards reducing  the  number  of  accidents
that we have on our roads, encourage new drivers to  be  much  more  careful
and improve the driving capability and vigilance of the older drivers,  like
some of us in this House. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.
