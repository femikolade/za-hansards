                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the German fugitive, Jurgen Harksen, alleged that -


       (a)  the Mayor of Cape Town, Mr Gerald Morkel, solicited R100 000
           from him to assist with building purposes;


       (b)  he funded Morkel's rental house in Higgovale to the tune of R45
           000;


       (c)  he paid former finance MEC, Mr Leon Markovitz, R500 000 in cash
           as part of the payment of R750 000 for the purchase of the
           Sports Café in the Waterfront for tax reasons; and


       (d)  Markovitz was paid a few million rands by Arabella Country
           Estate in Kleinmond to ensure smooth development;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the allegations made by Harksen against key leaders of the DA
           warrant an investigation that is open and transparent; and
       (b)  the response of the DA to these allegations demonstrates
           hypocrisy as they claim to be crusaders against corruption and
           yet drag their feet in dealing with this problem within their
           own ranks; and


  (3) calls on Mr Tony Leon and the DA to -


       (a)  embark on transparent investigations into the allegations of
           corruption within their own ranks; and


       (b)  act decisively against those members.
[Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the controversial march on 24 May 2002 in Johannesburg by
       the Congress of South African Students was marked by looting, theft
       and general chaos;
  (2) further notes that no official permit was granted for the march,
       making it illegal;


  (3) supports the Gauteng MEC for Education in his efforts to restore
       order by instituting a disciplinary hearing and other related
       measures;


  (4) condemns Cosas for its threats to disrupt education; and


  (5) appeals to Cosas to abandon its destructive struggle tactics and to
       help build a positive environment for learning.

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the device named the ``Drager Alcotester'', used for
       testing alcoholic content on motorists, has on several occasions been
       disputed as inaccurate by motorists;
  (2) further notes that such disputes cause many offending motorists to
       escape being prosecuted, which is tantamount to getting away with
       murder, as they might injure or kill themselves or other road users
       during drunken driving;


  (3) regrets that this state of affairs is going to continue over a long
       period of time, given that the only two experts on the device are in
       Durban and Pretoria; and


  (4) appeals to the Department of Transport to extend knowledge on the
       device to all towns and provinces.

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  taxi services on the Alexandra, Rosebank and Randburg routes in
           Gauteng have been disrupted during the past week, leaving
           thousands of commuters stranded without transport due to
           disputes between taxi drivers and taxi owners; and


       (b)  the dispute is about where the pick-up points should be;


  (2) condemns the actions of the taxi drivers and owners concerned and
       reminds them that thousands of commuters rely on taxis on a daily
       basis as their only means of transport;


  (3) calls on the taxi associations concerned to resolve their internal
       disputes and to use the taxi rank facilities that are provided, and
       further calls on the traffic officials to enforce the law; and


  (4) commends the speedy intervention of the Gauteng department of
       transport in assisting to resolve the internal disputes of the taxi
       associations concerned.
[Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mev die Speaker, ek sal namens die Nuwe NP voorstel:
  Dat die Huis -


  (1) die klaarblyklike voornemens van die Regering entoesiasties steun om
       sowel Suid-Afrika se pad- as sy spoornetwerk oor die volgende aantal
       jare uit die opbrengs van privatisering en die herskedulering van die
       begroting dramaties op te gradeer;


  (2) meen dat so 'n stap deurslaggewend sal bydra tot ekonomiese groei,
       werkskepping en die uitroei van armoede; en


     3) besef dat 'n goeie vervoer-infrastruktuur ook 'n voorwaarde is vir
        die suksesvolle sosio-ekonomiese herlewing van Afrika.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the NNP:


  That the House -


  (1) enthusiastically supports the apparent intentions of  the  Government
       to dramatically upgrade South Africa's road and  rail  networks  over
       the coming few years from  the  proceeds  of  privatisation  and  the
       rescheduling of the budget;


  (2) is of the opinion that such a step will contribute decisively towards
       economic growth, job creation and the eradication of poverty; and


  (3) realises that a sound transport infrastructure is also a prerequisite
       for the successful socioeconomic revival of Africa.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf
of the UDM during the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) appreciates and supports the research by the Stellenboch University-
       based Maritime Education and Research Institute, which has found that
       the Coega industrial development zone and deep water port at Port
       Elizabeth are vital to the economic growth of South Africa, Southern
       Africa, and the whole of the African continent;


  (2) is delighted that this industrial development zone will create
       employment opportunities of about 22 000 direct and indirect
       permanent posts, and some 54 000 construction-related posts;


  (3) welcomes the Coega Development Corporation's innovative plan to
       ensure that unskilled people are trained to meet the needs and
       expectations of investors; and


  (4)  congratulates  the  Stellenbosch   University,   Coega   Development
       Corporation and the Ministry of Trade and Industry on their plans  to
       swing the economic and industrial pendulum from the  one  time  world
       famous great Egyptian port of Alexandria ...
[Time expired.]

Mr A MLANGENI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with sadness the passing on of Ronald Mkhandawire,a former
       coach of Orlando Pirates;


  (2) further notes that yet another South African artist, a great
       sportsman in his lifetime, died a lonely and reclusive death;


  (3) recalls that the late Ronald Mkhandawire was the coach of the
       mercurial Buccaneers, which won the 1995 African Cup of Nations;


  (4) recognises that the late Ronald played a pivotal role in the
       Buccaneers' historic championship victory, a first by a South African
       team at a continental level competition;


  (5) acknowledges that this Zambian-born coach made a significant
       contribution to South African football;


  (6) mourns the loss of this great sportsman and sends condolences to his
       family; and


  (7) calls on the South African public and sport authorities to honour our
       sporting greats accordingly.


[Applause.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that Israel is facing an intense onslaught from
       many directions, in that -


       (a)  in excess of 400 Israelis, from babies to the elderly, have died
           and many others have been maimed for life, as attacks taking
           various forms have indiscriminately been unleashed throughout
           the country; and


       (b)  blatantly biased and sensational reporting in the media has
           fomented hatred and prejudice against Israel and Jewish people,
           which has led to unprecedented levels of anti-Semitism in most
           countries around the world;


  (2) congratulates ``Bridges for Peace'' on the rally held on 19 May 2002,
       which was addressed by Rev Kenneth Meshoe, President of the ACDP, to
       express solidarity with Israel and express the earnest desire of
       Christians for peace in the Middle East that will benefit all people;
       and


  (3) calls on the Government and all South Africans to play a peace-making
       role in the Middle East situation by not taking sides, but by
       offering assistance in bridging the divide between the peoples of
       this region.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  DA member Kenneth Dayi was shot and killed at a community
           meeting in Crossroads informal settlement on 21 April this year;


       (b)  other residents were injured in the shooting; and


       (c)  ANC councillor De Pouche Elese was seen firing his gun;


  (2) further notes that more than a month has passed and still no arrest
       has been made in connection with the death of Mr Dayi;


  (3) concludes that ANC members appear to be above the law and the lives
       of opposition supporters are treated as cheap by the Government; and


  (4) calls on the ANC to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that justice
       takes its course.

Mrs D M MOROBI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -

       South Africa;

       Tyamzashe, and his fellow members on their appointments;

       Magwaca, to the Board as commendable; and


  (4) commends the Minister of Sport and Recreation on the announcement of
       these appointments.
[Applause.]

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that beneficiaries of an RDP housing project in Clarens were
           expected to pay between R250 and R10 000 in order to obtain
           houses;
       (b)  that the Free State Housing Department is unable to supply
           reasons for this top-up payment;


       (c)  that a report by the Department mentions that payments were made
           to the then mayor of Clarens and current mayor of Ditlhabeng,
           who was also the developer; and


       (d)  that it appears that the ANC promotes individuals under whose
           authority corrupt practices take place; and


  (2) calls on the ANC in the Free State to take Batho  Pele  seriously  by
       holding their public representatives to  account  for  their  corrupt
       practices and malfeasance.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the IFP I shall move:


  That the House -

       Africa for more than 100 years and a large body of circumstantial
       evidence about its efficacy and safety;


  (3) views with concern the vacuum that still exists in relation to
       developing, protecting, licensing, patenting and marketing of
       traditional medicines; and


  (4) calls on the Medical Research Council, the  Ministers  of  Trade  and
       Industry and of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology to -


       (a)  foster development of indigenous plants;


       (b)  put an end to plant piracy; and


       (c)  enable South Africans to add billions to our GDP through a
           flourishing market in medicinal herbs.

Ms N E LAMANI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the team spirit in the Bafana Bafana camp under the
       leadership of coach Jomo Sono is at an all-time high;


  (2) notes that the Bafana Bafana championship-winning victories over the
       highly rated Scotland and Turkey sides in the Reunification Cup bear

  (2) die Minister van Buitelandse Sake versoek om so gou as moontlik
       wetgewing in te dien wat die aangeleentheid permanent sal regstel; en
  (3) sy dank uitspreek teenoor alle diplomate wat, dikwels onder  moeilike
       omstandighede, Suid-Afrika se belange in die buiteland bevorder.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with gratitude the fact that  taxation  of  the  allowances  of
       diplomats, which was to have come into effect on 1  March,  has  been
       temporarily deferred;

       soon as possible that will put this matter right permanently; and

    SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(1) TO CONDUCT SECOND READING DEBATE ON HEALTH
                       DONATIONS FUND ACT REPEAL BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the  draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That Rule 253(1) be suspended for the purposes of conducting  the  Second
  Reading debate on the Health Donations Fund Act Repeal Bill [B 20 - 2002]
  (National Assembly - sec 75).

Agreed to.

                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Rulings)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I would like to make some rulings.
On 14 May 2002, the hon Mr Landers raised a point of order with regard to a
remark made by the hon Mr Groenewald, who had interjected and said ``oubaas
se honne'' when the hon Mr Oosthuizen was delivering his speech. I said
that I would rule on the matter later.

I have now had an opportunity to read the unrevised Hansard and to consider
the contested remark. I have consulted first-language Afrikaans speakers
and am satisfied that the term ``oubaas se honne'' was used idiomatically
in the sense of dutifully carrying out an instruction or performing a duty
for or on behalf of one's senior or boss. In that sense and in that context
I do not regard the remark as unparliamentary.

However, we cannot overlook how other members may perceive such a remark
and we must be sensitive to the fact that different members, depending on
their cultural backgrounds, may respond differently to a particular remark.
I, therefore, appeal to hon members generally to moderate their language.

Again on the same day, 14 May 2002, the hon Andrew raised a point of order
with regard to a remark made by the hon Oosthuizen that was addressed to
the hon Lee. In referring to the hon Lee, the hon Oosthuizen said:


  The difference between you and me is that I have no price tag, you have
  one.

This remark reflects on the integrity of the member, and I therefore ask
the hon Oosthuizen to withdraw it. [Laughter.]

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, out of respect for the Chair, the Rules
of this House and this institution, I withdraw that remark unconditionally.

But may I add that I do so, not because Mr Lee ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! No, hon member, I do not want an addition.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: I withdraw unconditionally, Madam Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much for the withdrawal. [Applause.]

The House adjourned at 16:19.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on European Convention on Extradition, dated 22 May 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the request for approval  by  Parliament  of  the
         European Convention on  Extradition,  referred  to  it,  recommends
         that the House, in terms of section  231(2)  of  the  Constitution,
         approve the said Protocol, with the declaration that:


         (1)     the Republic of South Africa, for the purposes of Article
              2 of the Convention, shall not extradite any person unless the
              punishment awarded for a conviction in respect of which he or
              she is being sought, is a sentence of imprisonment of at least
              six months; and


         (2)     for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention, the term
              "nationals" is defined, in terms of South Africa's legal
              system, as persons who have acquired South African citizenship
              by means of birth, descent or naturalisation. This includes
              persons with citizenship of South Africa and of another
              country. These persons will all be liable to be extradited.
              South Africa's acceptance of dual citizenship will therefore
              not bar the extradition of a person where he or she is also in
              possession of a citizenship of a country which prohibits the
              extradition of its nationals.


     Report to be considered.

2.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional
     Development on SADC Protocol Against Corruption, dated 22 May 2002:
         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development,
         having considered the request for approval by Parliament of the
         SADC Protocol Against Corruption, referred to it, recommends that
         the House, in terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution, approve
         the said Protocol.


         The Committee is of the opinion that, in accordance with Article
         12 of the Protocol, the Director-General of Justice and
         Constitutional Development should be designated as the authority
         for purposes of co-operation and assistance under this Protocol.


     Report to be considered.
