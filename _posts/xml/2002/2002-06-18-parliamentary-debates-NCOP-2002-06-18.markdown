                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter,  ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting van die Raad gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem dat -


   (1)      die leier van die DP/DA, Tony  Leon,  die  afgelope  naweek  die
        Noord-Kaap besoek het, en oor  die  nasionale  media  die  stelling
        gemaak het dat 80% van die DA-raadslede na  die  oorloopgeleentheid
        by die DA gaan bly;


   (2)      die leierskap van die DP vantevore al die waarheid gerek het  om
        by omstandighede te pas;


   (3)      daar geen substansie vir die  stelling  is  nie,  aangesien  die
        raadslede in die  Noord-Kaap  lojaliteit  aan  die  DA  voorgee  om
        sodoende skorsing deur die DP/DA vry te spring;


   (4)      die Nuwe NP om verskoning vra  dat  mense  met  integriteit  die
        leuen, wat deur die  DP/DA  geskep  is,  moet  leef,  want  dit  is
        onbillik; en


   (5)      die einde egter in sig is vir hulle  wat  vasgevang  is  in  die
        DP/DA-kokon van negatiwiteit om  vry  te  breek  en  deel  van  die
        hoofstroompolitiek te word waar hulle 'n verskil kan maak  aan  die
        lewens van al die mense om ons, eerder as om op  die  sypaadjie  te
        sit en kritiseer.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move that on  the  next  sitting  day  I
shall move:


  That the Council notes that-


   (1)      the leader of the DP/DA, Tony Leon visited the Northern Cape the
        past weekend, and made a statement in the national media  that  80%
        of the DA councillors will remain with the DA after the opportunity
        to cross the floor;


   (2)      the leadership of the DP have previously stretched the truth  to
        fit the circumstances;


   (3)      there is no substance to the statement, as  the  councillors  in
        the Northern Cape are feigning loyalty to the DA in order to  avoid
        suspension by the DP/DA;


   (4)      the New NP apologises that people with integrity  have  to  live
        the lie, created by the DP/DA, for this is unfair; and


   (5)      the end is, however, in sight for  those  caught  in  the  DP/DA
        cocoon of negativity to break free and to become part of mainstream
        politics where they can make a difference to the lives of  all  the
        people  around  us,  rather  than  sitting  on  the  sidewalk   and
        criticising.]

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad: -


  (1) kennis neem dat in die plaaslike  regeringsverkiesing  van  2000  die
       Demokratiese Alliansie 'n totaal van 1 370  raadslede  verkies  gekry
       het, en dat bykans 600 hiervan uit die Nuwe NP-stal gekom het; ...
[Tussenwerpsels.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order! Order, hon member!

Mnr J L THERON:


  (2) in die lig hiervan sal dit baie insiggewend wees om daarop te let dat
       verreweg die oorgrote meerderheid van hierdie  raadslede  ongetwyfeld
       by die DA gaan bly; en


  (3) verder daarop let dat die oorgrote meerderheid van die raadslede  dus
       gaan bly staan by die manifes waarvolgens hulle verkies is.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting  of  the
House I shall move:


  That the Council notes that -


   (1)      during the local government elections  of  2000  the  Democratic
        Alliance had a total of 1 370 councillors elected and  that  nearly
        600 of these came from the New NP stable;


   (2)      in the light of this, by far the majority of  these  councillors
        will undoubtedly stay with the DA; and


   (3)      the majority of the councillors  will  therefore  stand  by  the
        manifesto according to which they were elected.]

[Interjections.]

                 SENSELESS MURDERS ON FARM IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)
Dr E A CONROY:  Voorsitter,  ek  stel  voor  sonder  kennisgewing:  [I  move
without notice:]


  That the Council -
  (1) joins the uMshwati mayor, Moses Mkhize, in his  condemnation  of  the
       unnecessary and senseless murder of Mr Robin and  Mrs  Joan  Dent  on
       their farm in KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) expresses its deepest sympathy to the Dent couple's sons Jonathan and
       Nicholas and their family and friends in their hour of mourning;


  (3) wishes Nicholas Dent strength in the period of recuperation following
       his traumatic experience during which he had to witness the murder of
       his parents and was  then  forced  to  help  the  murderers  as  they
       escaped; and


  (4) will continue to play a reconciliatory role to  prevent  inflammatory
       behaviour which could contribute to repetitions  of  this  event  and
       similar shocking events.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

      RECOGNITION OF OUR PRESIDENT'S CONTRIBUTION ON HIS 60TH BIRTHDAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the birthday of our President takes place at  a  time  when  our
           continent is free;


       (b)  our President is one of the  principal  architects  of  the  New
           Partnership for Africa's Development;


       (c)  his birthday will be celebrated with the imminent birth  of  the
           African Union;


       (d)  he has committed our country and its representatives to  achieve
           peace and resolve conflict in Africa and the world;


       (e)  he celebrates his  birthday  as  the  ANC  celebrates  its  90th
           anniversary and is committed to the struggle for the eradication
           of poverty and re-affirming the dignity of our people; and


       (f)  in recognition of the richness of the leadership  provided,  the
           World Summit on Sustainable Development will  be  conferring  on
           the soil of our land;


  (2)  wishes  him  a  very  happy  60th  birthday,  many  happy  years  of
       contentment, continued wisdom, integrity  and  spiritual  well-being;
       and


  (3) recognises -


       (a)  his immense contribution and commitment to  the  achievement  of
           peace, the deepening of democracy and  eradication  of  poverty,
           the development of our continent and his perennial struggle  for
           the affirmation of the dignity of all persons; and


         (b)     that the 60 years of  his  life  bear  testimony  that  the
              integrity and noble commitment of an individual can alter  the
              course  of  humanity  from  a  situation  of  conflict  to   a
              transition to peace and justice.

Happy Birthday, Mr President.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, I move without notice:

       successful events in the Free State province in honour of Youth Day -




       (a)  a moral regeneration summit;

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             LACK OF ACCESS TO MONTHLY SOCIAL GRANT FOR CHILDREN

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) notes with concern that children throughout the country are  starving
       because they have not been registered and  consequently  cannot  gain
       access to a monthly social grant;


  (2) further notes that this unacceptable situation  is  being  caused  by
       administrative  impediments  and  a  lack  of  interdepartmental  co-
       operation; and


  (3) appeals to the Department of Social  Development  and  to  the  other
       departments concerned to make a  co-ordinated  effort  in  addressing
       this problem, and to put together a task  team  that  will  focus  in
       particular on the registration of children.

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Chairperson I recommend the following as an amendment:


  That, in paragraph (1), ``throughout'' be  substituted  by  ``in  certain
  parts of''.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mrs Vilakazi, there is a proposed amendment  to
the motion. Is it acceptable?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Yes, Chairperson, it is acceptable.  Amendment  agreed  to
in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution, namely:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern that children in certain parts of the country  are
       starving because they  have  not  been  registered  and  consequently
       cannot gain access to a monthly social grant;


  (2) further notes that this unacceptable situation  is  being  caused  by
       administrative  impediments  and  a  lack  of  interdepartmental  co-
       operation; and


  (3) appeals to the Department of Social  Development  and  to  the  other
       departments concerned to make a  co-ordinated  effort  in  addressing
       this problem, and to put together a task  team  that  will  focus  in
       particular on the registration of children.


                   INCREASE IN DRUG USE THROUGHOUT COUNTRY
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its concern at an enormous increase in drug use  throughout
       the country;


  (2) notes that, according to the Cape Times of today, 18 June  2002,  the
       number of users has multiplied in the past five years;


  (3) further notes with shock that children  as  young  as  11  years  are
       treated for addiction;


  (4) expresses its concern at the fact that drug centres are  battling  to
       cope with the unprecedented demand for treatment; and

       prevention of drug abuse and of the entry of illegal drugs  into  the
       country.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

    CALL TO REFRAIN FROM USING ``KILL THE FARMER; KILL THE BOER!'' SLOGAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) calls upon all who use or encourage the  outdated  political  slogan,
       ``Kill the farmer; kill the boer!'' to refrain from doing so  in  the
       future;


  (2) notes that it was a slogan created for a different time in  different
       circumstances and now,  in  our  current  circumstances,  amounts  to
       unconstitutional hate speak; and


  (3) endorses the need for ongoing reconciliation and  the  reconstruction
       of our society.
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to  that  motion?
There is an objection. The motion therefore  becomes  notice  of  a  motion.
[Interjections.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it  possible  to  record
the names of the people who objected to that motion? [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: There is no such requirement in  terms  of  our
procedures. [Interjections.] Order! Order, hon member, all you  need  to  do
is object. The objection has been recognised through converting the  motion.
I think that is sufficient.

Hon members, I have been informed that there  will  be  one  debate  on  the
three orders that are printed on the Order  Paper.  I  would  also  like  to
alert our members to the fact that the select committee reports relating  to
the three orders have been placed on the desks of members in the House,  and
you should have the reports before you.

You should know that the report of the  Select  Committee  on  Security  and
Constitutional Affairs, on the Constitution of the Republic of South  Africa
Second Amendment Bill, should refer to the Bill B17B-2002 and the  amendment
B17C-2002.

     CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

               (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon.)

   LOSS OR RETENTION OF MEMBERSHIP OF NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES
                                    BILL

               (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon.)

            LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPAL STRUCTURES AMENDMENT BILL

                 (Consideration of Bill and Report thereon.)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  this
is the second occasion on which I have had the pleasure to participate in  a
debate in this House on the legislation dealing with the issue  of  crossing
the floor. The first was when the public debate on  the  first  Constitution
of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Bill took place in this  House  as
required by section 74 (5)(c) of  the  Constitution.  Hon  members  are,  no
doubt,  aware  that  this  Bill,  which  regulates  crossing  in  the  local
government sphere, is but one of four pieces  of  legislation  dealing  with
crossing of the floor, the others being the subject of today's debate.

The Bills in question are the following: The first is the Loss or  Retention
of Membership of National and  Provincial  Legislatures  Bill,  which  deals
with the issue of crossing the  floor  in  the  National  Assembly  and  the
provincial  legislatures.  The  second  Bill  is  the  Constitution  of  the
Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Bill, which  creates  a  mechanism
for adjusting the composition of a province's delegation to the NCOP in  the
event  of  a  significant  change  in  the  composition  of   a   provincial
legislature. The final member  of  the  quartet  is  the  Local  Government:
Municipal Structures Amendment Bill, which aims to harmonise the  structures
Act with the provisions of the first Constitution-amending Bill which, as  I
have said, addresses crossing the floor in the local government sphere.

Hon members will recall that when the first Constitution-amending  Bill  was
debated in this House, I made the following remarks, among others:


  It is already apparent,  from  the  comments  received,  that  there  are
  certain  areas  of  the  proposed  legislation  that  will  require  some
  refinement and I believe that those matters will shortly  be  dealt  with
  comprehensively by the relevant committees of Parliament.


  I do not wish to pre-empt the possible changes, save to remark  that  the
  provisions of the membership Bill will obviously have to be brought  into
  line with those of the Republic of South  Africa  Constitution  Amendment
  Bill because we want to ensure that the principles governing  changes  of
  party membership and mergers or subdivision of parties will be  the  same
  at national, provincial and local government levels.

I am of the view that the relevant  portfolio  committees  in  the  National
Assembly  and  the  select  committees  in  the  NCOP  displayed   exemplary
dedication and co-operation in their deliberations on this legislation.  The
committees  held  public  hearings  on  the   legislation   and   considered
submissions made by a  variety  of  role-players.  From  the  way  that  the
committees  developed  and  refined  the  various  draft  versions  of  this
legislation, it  is  clear  that  they  have  displayed  extraordinary  zeal
towards improving the legislation, and I  think  that  we  have  achieved  a
balanced concept which we can be proud of.

The Select Committee on Security and  Constitutional  Affairs  has  proposed
amendments to both the Constitution of the Republic of South  Africa  Second
Amendment Bill and the membership Bill which, albeit of a technical  nature,
will no doubt serve to further clarify the  practical  implications  of  the
procedures envisaged in the legislation. Whilst  recognising  the  need  for
legislation of this kind, we  are  committed  to  ensuring  that  the  basic
tenets underlying our system of democracy should remain intact.

Any provisions relating to changes of party membership and changes in  party
representation should  be  carefully  crafted  so  as  not  to  threaten  to
destabilise any tier or sphere of government. The main principle  underlying
the proposed legislation was  that  changes  of  party  membership,  mergers
between parties and, for that matter,  any  subdivision  of  parties  should
only be allowed for very limited periods of time.

With the wisdom of hindsight,  the  first  Constitution  amending  Bill,  as
originally published for comment, improved upon this concept by  stipulating
fixed periods which would be allowed for such  changes  in  the  legislation
itself, unlike the original proposal put forward  by  the  membership  Bill,
which would entail that the President of the Republic would,  from  time  to
time, determine such periods by proclamation in the Gazette.
The mechanism eventually established  in  the  legislation  entails  that  a
member of a national  or  provincial  legislature  and  a  councillor  in  a
municipal council will be allowed to change  party  membership  or  a  party
will be allowed to merge or to subdivide, or to subdivide  and  merge,  only
during the first 15 days following the commencement of the legislation  and,
thereafter, only during a period of 15 days from the first to the  15th  day
of September in the second year  following  the  date  of  an  election  and
during a period of 15 days from the first to the 15th day  of  September  in
the fourth year following the date of an election. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I want to  express  my  sincere  thanks  to
members of the Select Committees on Security and Constitutional Affairs  and
on Local Government and Administration. We  are  where  we  are  because  of
their  preparedness,  dedication,  unselfishness  and  commitment.  If   hon
members are the stars, then I am the moon.

On 7 April we explained in this very Chamber what this legislation  was  all
about. We went further to explain what needed to be done  when  members  and
councillors want to cross the floor. Again we explained  how  parties  could
merge  or  subdivide.  During  those  deliberations  we  made  a   call   to
stakeholders to come and participate in our public hearings. South  Africans
responded positively. Thanks to them, dear South Africans, and  I  can  only
say to them, the fruits of their labour will last longer than the colour  of
their skin.

Because of the interaction with stakeholders or their contribution,  we  are
bringing before this Council modified legislation by bringing in a  balanced
piece of legislation. The final version we are committing  to  this  Council
takes into account all concerns raised by stakeholders. It is  accommodative
and polished.

Before one touches on some key issues in  this  legislation,  there  is  one
disturbing matter I must mention. I was reliably  informed  that  there  are
parties and some individuals who are busy forcing their councillors to  sign
some forms accepting that they are crossing the floor. We are told  that  if
a councillor refuses to sign, he or she is threatened with  being  replaced.
We are told that there are those who have signed already.

I want to draw the attention of these parties  to  the  provisions  of  item
7(1) of the proposed new Schedule 6A in the  Constitution  of  the  Republic
South Africa Amendment Bill. It categorically states that  any  crossing  of
the floor, merging of parties or subdivision can only take place during  the
window period, not before or after.

All forms signed  before  the  window  period,  in  my  opinion,  should  be
nullified. In terms of the resolution  we  passed  few  days  ago,  relevant
parties, the Speaker's Office, and the Secretary to Parliament are  expected
to deal with some of these logistics and modalities.

I want to formally propose  that  a  member  or  a  councillor  be  required
personally to submit his or her form to the relevant  office,  and  that  no
party be allowed to submit forms on behalf of a member or a  councillor.  If
it is discovered that councillors  were  forced  into  signing  those  forms
before the stated period, those councillors must  expose  those  parties  or
those individuals for who they are.

We cannot tolerate people who are not ashamed of adjusting  their  underwear
in public. In terms of the original Bill we  presented  to  Parliament,  the
window period  was  going  to  be  twice  a  year,  that  is,  February  and
September. But after a lengthy discussion  and  having  taken  into  account
inputs by stakeholders, both committees agreed that the window period  would
be twice in a five-year term. To put it a little  more  simply,  the  window
period will be in the second year and the fourth year after an election.  If
I were in a classroom I  would  demonstrate  by  using  my  fingers  to  say
crossing, no crossing; crossing, no crossing. [Laughter.] But because  I  am
in Parliament I cannot do that.

For example, the next crossing for the national and  provincial  governments
will only be in the next Parliament, but the  local  governments  will  have
their next bite in September 2004.

Members will recall that in the original draft  there  was  going  to  be  a
threshold in all the window periods - that is, a 10% requirement  was  going
to be in place whenever there was to be a window period. Thanks to the  wide
consultations we had with parties and some NGOs, that requirement  will  not
be there in the first window period. Immediately after the  commencement  of
this Act, it will be a free-for-all. This will be  during  the  transitional
arrangement.

What is going to happen is that during this first window  period,  a  member
or a councillor can take his jacket or her  clutch  bag  and  cross  to  the
party of his or her choice, or form a new party. But in future, it  will  be
a threshold all the way.

I want to sound a word of caution to people who  are  going  to  cross  that
floor: They will be allowed to cross only once during  that  window  period.
They  should  think  before  they  cross,  because  some  parties  might  be
interested in their seat, not in them.

Owing to the constraints  of  time,  I  am  not  going  to  talk  about  the
composition of the council  after  crossing,  how  seats  are  going  to  be
allocated to  parties  in  the  subcouncils,  how  the  councils  should  be
reconstituted after crossing, or how the first meeting  is  to  be  convened
after crossing. Those are just technical and administrative. That  would  be
like combing my hair in the kitchen, or handing  out  business  cards  at  a
funeral, or cleaning one's ear with one's little finger in public.

Permanent delegates in the NCOP are going  to  be  directly  and  indirectly
affected by this legislation. Any crossing  in  the  provincial  legislature
will affect the NCOP's permanent delegates directly. Those crossing  in  the
provincial legislature will have an impact on this  Council.  Unfortunately,
some members in this Council might be replaced.

It is a pity that whilst members in the  NA,  MPLs,  councillors  and  their
parties will be exercising their right during the window period, members  in
the NCOP cannot. But, of course, it is understandable,  because  members  in
the NCOP are appointed, not directly elected. That is the only difference.

Even though this cannot be legislated, I want to suggest that  something  be
done to allow members who might be affected by any crossing in a  particular
legislature to buy back their pensions for the period they were supposed  to
be in this Council.

On behalf of the select committee, I would like to submit our amendments  to
the Loss or Retention of Membership of National and Provincial  Legislatures
Bill, as tabled before Parliament. I will not read them because members  can
do so  for  themselves.  They  have  been  agreed  to  by  all  parties  and
provinces.

Immediately after today's debate, the long-awaited  window  period  will  be
opened. Parties are ready to receive new members and councillors  are  ready
to move.

Let us allow them to exercise their rights. Those parties  who  did  not  do
their homework will be kicking and screaming like  little  babies.  All  one
will hear will be, ``We was robbed.'' Dear patriots, loyal  South  Africans,
let us support this legislation. King Solomon once  said,  ``In  all  labour
there is profit.'' Let us go and do it,  because  we  can.  I  have  spoken.
[Applause.]

Mr  L  G  LEVER:  Chairperson,  the  three  Bills  before  this  House   are
collectively and  colloquially  known  as  the  ``crossing  of  the  floor''
legislation. The concept of crossing the floor is  not  a  new  one.  It  is
something that my party has been  advocating  since  the  earliest  days  of
constitutional negotiations. The reason we have  been  advocating  a  system
allowing floor-crossing seems to have  been  lost  in  the  context  of  the
present debate. The provision for crossing the floor is to  allow  a  member
to leave a party when the  party  changes  its  agenda  and  policies  in  a
fundamental manner, without losing  his  or  her  seat  in  the  legislature
concerned.

In the present context in which these three Bills come  before  this  House,
the motivation behind these Bills is diametrically  opposed  to  allowing  a
member to maintain his or her compact with the  electorate.  The  motivation
for these three Bills is to allow for a marriage of convenience between  the
ANC and the New NP. It is simply to allow  the  ANC  to  grab  and  maintain
power in the Western Cape and the  Cape  Town  Metro.  [Interjections.]  The
whole motivation  for  the  present  three  Bills  comes  out  of  the  deal
consummated between the ANC and the New NP.

Who will win the first round of the floor crossing?  That  is  the  question
that is on everyone's lips. I do not know who will win, but I do  know  that
the New NP contributed 592 local government councillors  to  the  Democratic
Alliance. For the New NP to break even, they need to  persuade  all  592  to
return to their old political home. I am sure some of the  previous  members
of the New NP will accept the invitation to return to their old home, but  I
am equally sure that a significant number will stay in their  new  political
home. [Interjections.]

As members of the NCOP cannot, by law, cross  the  floor,  I  cannot  invite
fellow hon members of this House to join me in the  DA  ...  [Interjections]
... but their colleagues in the  other  legislatures  are  most  welcome  to
join. [Interjections.]

Despite the fact that the present three Bills  come  before  this  House  to
cater for political expediency, we support the legislation because  we  feel
that the short-term expediency will pass, and in the long term, as a  result
of this legislation, ordinary members of Parliament  and  members  of  other
legislatures  will  achieve  greater  respect  and   autonomy   from   their
particular political parties. [Applause.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Madam Chair, hon minister and hon members, we  know  before
a horse dies it has to kick its last kick. The DA is doing that now.

The lifting of restrictions on politicians crossing the floor is one of  the
most significant legislative developments coming from Parliament  since  the
drafting of the final Constitution. Contrary to the  lie  which  the  DA  is
spreading about the real purpose of this legislation, the ANC believes  this
legislation is a definite sign that our democracy is maturing.

Moreover, we believe legislation such as this has become necessary to  cater
for political realignment and to prevent  the  formation  of  racial  blocs,
which contribute to racial polarisation, and which are  aimed  primarily  at
preserving racial privileges. I find it  very  difficult  to  reconcile  the
DA's objections to certain aspects of the legislation  with  their  previous
support for legislation of this kind.  If  hon  members  would  recall,  the
proposal to allow members of  legislatures  to  cross  the  floor  was  very
vocally supported by the DP.

In fact, former DP politician Colin Eglin was among those who, as  long  ago
as 1994, championed floor-crossing  legislation.  The  DA  itself  submitted
proposals to Deputy President Jacob Zuma last year, on how best to lift  the
antidefection clause.  According to the DA's Tertius Delport, the DA  has  a
fundamental objection against the inclusion of the  clause,  which  requires
the support of at least 10% of a party's members before they can  cross  the
floor to another party.

Why are they so afraid of  this  10%  requirement?  [Interjections.]  Is  it
because they are not confident enough of retaining their  members?  I  would
not be surprised if they lacked a bit  of  confidence,  given  the  scandals
that have rocked this party in recent times. I will understand if there  are
a lot of DA members who might feel uncomfortable with the DA right now,  and
would want to leave the party because  of  its  association  with  unsavoury
characters. We have already seen one of the DA's most  senior  Western  Cape
politicians quitting politics as a result of these scandals.

I am sure there are also a lot of DA members who are uncomfortable with  the
confrontational and autocratic style of the DA  leadership.  Many  of  these
members want to make a contribution to reconciliation  and  nation-building,
but they are prevented from doing so by the DA's  confrontational  style  of
politics. If this legislation is adopted, justice will  eventually  prevail,
particularly in the Western Cape, where the ANC  has  won  the  majority  of
votes, but was excluded by virtue of the DP's ambitions to  get  a  foothold
in  Government,  which  they  hoped  to  use  to  show  they  are  a  viable
alternative to the ANC. [Applause.]

Mr S NGWENYA (Gauteng): Madam Chair, Minister Maduna, hon members,  first  I
would  like  to  commend  the  Springbok  boys,  for  having  beaten  Wales.
[Interjections.]

Section 19 of the Constitution of our country states that:


  Every citizen is free to make political choices, which includes the right
  to form a political party;  to  participate  in  the  activities  of,  or
  recruit members for, a political party ...

Implicitly, intimidation or  coercion  of  any  form  is  outlawed.  This  I
mention to concur with member Kgoshi Mokoena. As we rise  to  support  these
Bills, it has come to our attention that  certain  parties  in  Gauteng  are
unashamedly doing exactly what member  Mokoena  is  doing,  forcing  certain
councillors to sign those forms, lest they be  taken  out  of  the  council.
[Interjections.] This is a party that  presents  itself  in  the  media  and
everywhere  else  as  a  morally  and  ethically  ``skoon  papier''   party.
[Laughter.]

Since 1995 some political representatives at national and  provincial  level
have in actual fact been under political  bondage  within  their  respective
parties. They had to conform to party policies and/or  leadership  style,  a
top-down type of leadership style, which they may no longer agree  with.  In
certain  instances,  of  course,  these  members'  rebelliousness   or   ill
discipline could be the cause of their own frustration.

It may well be that some amongst these are dedicated and diligent  political
representatives. They sincerely still want to play a meaningful role in  our
country's long and arduous walk of social transformation.  Yet  it  is  also
true that  some  may  just  be  habitual  political  opportunists,  bent  on
misusing the system for their self-interest -  cheque  collectors.  I  would
concur with member Mokoena when he tries to warn us that people  should  not
jump into crossing the floor without proper thought,  they  must  think  and
think and think.

Some have expressed the views that the Bills before  us  are  a  recipe  for
political chaos. Others even go so far  as  to  say  that  these  Bills  are
immoral, whilst some say we are going against the international  civil  ways
of democracy. These are South  Africans  who  are  caught  in  a  particular
situation at a particular point in history, and they  do  not  know  how  to
handle  this.  It  would  be  naive  of  any  of  us  to  presume  that  the
electorate's political thinking ability is switched  off  immediately  after
the elections, for the following three to five years.

Research findings after  research  findings  after  the  elections  of  1994
demonstrate how electorates have  been  changing  allegiance.  To  say  that
these Bills are immoral, is ridiculous, as is  the  conclusion  that  it  is
immoral to introduce these Bills now. Yet, since the first election of  1994
to date, numerous researches have demonstrated how electorates have  shifted
their voting patterns between the election periods.

Yesterday the Markinor research here in the Western  Cape  showed  that  the
DA/DP  has  dropped  from   22%   to   11%   since   the   last   elections.
[Interjections.] The issue is not whether one  believes  this  or  not;  the
issue is that  this  does  happen.  Electorates  are  not  static  in  their
thinking, in their preference; they will change. Perhaps Markinor is  wrong.
To suggest that we are doing something to be scoffed  by  the  international
community is ludicrous. Who determines what is international and  what  not?
When President Bush defines what terrorism is, and what is not, and  cajoles
everybody into believing him, was that the international  standard?  Why  do
people now tell us that we are going to be the laughing stock?

If South Africa shifts  from  a  100-day  assessment  period  of  the  newly
inaugurated President to a six-month assessment, because  of  certain  sound
factors that suit the South African situation, why would this  be  abnormal?
People would say, why do we not follow the so-called  civilised  world?  But
we have our own material conditions to address.

By introducing these Bills, we  are  striving  to  enhance  the  culture  of
democracy in our country. Any person who, during the window  period,  should
have the need to freely migrate  to  another  party,  or  party  wanting  to
subdivide and unite with another, must only do so after  a  well-thought-out
process, free from fear or intimidation, as section 19 of  our  Constitution
advocates. People must think of the consequences of the potential  of  their
misjudgment of future events. Even more important is  that  henceforth  most
political parties, if not all, are going to embark on a revamping  of  their
political management systems, political  training  and  quality  control  of
candidates particularly for the  forthcoming  general  elections.  No  party
would like just to accept any type of  person  because  they  have  come  to
them, as Kgoshi indicated.

Parties, particularly for councillors, will have to  have  thorough  quality
control of their candidates. No  more  ...  yiza,  singene  nje,  siphangele
mfondini. [... come, let's go in and work, mate.]

Unfortunately, these Bills, for some amongst us, may be  a  political  death
knell, as my comrade said. Some may lose their political seats in  terms  of
provincial representativity, hence the  complaints  of  political  chaos.  A
sincere word of sympathy may be expressed to such  persons,  but  then  they
have a chance of salvaging their situation  rather  than  sticking  to  some
sinking ships. They can jump to the passing rescue ship  within  the  15-day
window of political salvation and stop moaning. They have freedom of  choice
of political home.

Democracy was  never  intended  to  be  a  static  phenomenon.  It  is  both
evolutionary and revolutionary, as will be the Bills before us  today,  once
the President has asserted to them - and only then,  so  people  should  not
start marakalas now. Then the political stage in our country  will  be  once
more revolutionised and evolution within parties will have  to  take  place.
There will be no holy cows. More important is going to be the social  impact
of grappling with the new situations.

It would in the doubting Thomases' interest to  bear  in  mind  the  message
from an interesting advert on TV. It goes like this: You snooze,  you  lose.
Walala, wasala. [You sleep, you lose.] [Kwaqhwatywa.] [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, the Bills before this  House  today  undoubtedly
will go down in the annals of our  history  for  what  they  are,  but  more
particularly  because  of  how  the  Constitution,  which  is  said  to   be
sacrosanct, has actually been tampered with.

The IFP has never opposed pieces  of  legislation  coming  from  the  ruling
party just for the sake of opposing them,  and  as  a  result  it  has  been
labelled in some quarters as an appendage of the ANC. This  does  not  worry
us because we know our principles. But today, we are facing  a  very  unique
problem - the problem of political morality contained  in  these  Bills.  We
cannot sacrifice our moral beliefs for political expediency, for we  believe
that morality is the surest pledge of freedom.

The  constitutional  provision  prohibiting  members  of   Parliament   from
crossing the floor introduced the so-called  imperative  mandate  theory  of
representation  to  the  South  African  parliamentary  system,  whereby   a
representative would be bound by the mandates issued by the political  party
on  which  he  or  she  was  elected  as  a  member   of   Parliament.   The
constitutional provision in question is the one that requires  a  member  of
Parliament or legislature to vacate his or her seat if  he  or  she  resigns
from his or her political party of loses his or her membership of the  party
for whatever reason.

The South African parliamentary system has adopted  the  imperative  mandate
theory  of  representation  as  opposed  to  the  free  mandate  theory   of
representation, which has been attributed to  our  party  list  proportional
representation electoral system. In terms of the free  mandate  theory,  the
representative is not bound by  any  mandate  whatsoever,  but  is  free  to
exercise his or her mandate and is bound only by the dictates of his or  her
own conscience. Retaining the imperative mandate  theory  whilst  purporting
to allow members to cross the floor is a contradiction  in  terms.  This  is
what gives us a major problem with these Bills.

The IFP believes that it would be morally and constitutionally wrong for  an
individual to decide overnight that he or she wants to cross the  floor  and
violate the mandate of the voters who  voted  for  the  party  to  represent
their needs. The will of the people, as expressed  in  an  election,  should
not be negated and substituted by the will of an individual or  a  group  of
individuals.

It makes one shudder to think that our young  Constitution  can  be  amended
willy-nilly for reasons of expediency. The Constitution  is  not  a  toy  to
play with. We know very well that this is being done simply  to  accommodate
the Western Cape situation for the ANC-New NP coalition. We have no  problem
with that per se. We only have a problem with the process  to  achieve  that
goal, which is indeed nefarious. [Interjections.]

Because we respect the electoral mandate  and  the  electoral  will  of  the
people who voted for us, the IFP cannot support  these  Bills  because  they
are,  we  believe,  immoral  and  unacceptable.   We   oppose   the   Bills.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order,  hon  members!
The hon member has the right to freedom of expression.

Mr P D N  MALOYI:  Chairperson,  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development,  Comrade  Penuell  Maduna,  permanent  and  special  delegates,
ladies and gentlemen, I once more stand before you to present the  views  of
my province  on  the  Loss  or  Retention  of  Membership  of  National  and
Provincial Legislatures Bill and the Constitution of the Republic  of  South
Africa Second Amendment Bill.

Item 23A of Schedule 2 to the Constitution of the Republic of  South  Africa
of 1993 dictates to us that if an opportunity arises, an Act  of  Parliament
can be passed within a reasonable period after the  coming  into  effect  of
the new Constitution of 1996 to amend the item in order to provide  for  the
manner in which it would be possible for a  member  of  the  legislature  to
move from one party to the other without losing his  or  her  seat  and  for
different parties to merge or subdivide into more than one party.

The North West province is of the opinion - with which I  suspect  that  all
of us agree - that our democracy is dynamic; it is not stagnant.  It  allows
material conditions to assist in dictating the way forward.

We are a learning nation, and a learning nation is a nation that is able  to
set the trend. I am therefore proud to stand before the House and  pronounce
that we are trend-setters.

This is an opportune time to allow members of Parliament to  move  from  one
party to another and to allow parties to merge  or  subdivide.  It  is  also
necessary that mechanisms should be  set  up  to  avoid  a  situation  where
individuals would want to change parties like  underwear  for  opportunistic
reasons.

Moving from one party to the other due to ideological differences cannot  be
regarded as being opportunistic, but at the  same  time  nobody  can  justly
claim that he or she has an ideological difference with the  party  if  that
person does not have a sizeable number of persons behind him  or  her.  That
is why the present piece of  legislation  before  us  tries  to  cover  that
aspect. It talks about the 10% threshold. The province of the North West  is
satisfied that this Bill attempts to balance the two concepts.

As a consequence of the Loss or Retention  of  Membership  of  National  and
Provincial  Legislatures  Bill  there  might  be  some  changes   of   party
representation in the provincial legislature which might lead to changes  in
delegations to the National Council of Provinces.

The Constitution of the Republic  of  South  Africa  Second  Amendment  Bill
provides that if, as a consequence of this legislation,  there  are  changes
in the composition of a provincial  legislature,  that  legislature  should,
within 30 days of  such  changes,  redetermine  how  many  of  each  party's
delegates are to be permanent and how many are to be  special  delegates  to
this House.

On 27 May 2002, we briefed our province on the two Bills  and,  on  13  June
2002, we received a negotiating mandate from our  province  indicating  that
the province supported the two Bills. Finally, on 18 June, which  is  today,
we received a final mandate that says the North West delegation  should,  on
behalf of the province, vote in favour of the two Bills.

With the powers vested in me by the  North  West  province,  I  support  the
passage of the Loss or Retention of Membership of  National  and  Provincial
Legislatures Bill and urge all parties to support the  Constitution  of  the
Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Bill. [Applause.]
Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, the New NP  fully  supports  this  legislation,
including the technical amendment which  merely  provides  for  a  deadlock-
breaking mechanism. My party is on record as having been all  along  against
an antidefection clause and in favour of a  free  mandate.  We  have  always
believed and still do that members of  legislatures  or  councillors  should
not represent only the interest of their constituency,  political  party  or
ward, but  should  represent  the  best  interests  of  the  entire  nation,
province or municipality. Hence our slogan, ``South Africa first''.

The fact that public representatives will, after the coming  into  operation
of these Bills, be in a position to act in terms of their conscience and  in
terms of what is in the best interests of our nation as a  whole,  coincides
not  only  with  one  of  the  most  important  principles  on   which   our
Constitution and  our  new  dispensation  are  based,  namely  participatory
democracy, but also with the principles and policies of the New NP.

Tydens  die  1999-verkiesing  het  die  Nuwe  NP  sy  verbintenis   tot   'n
konstruktiewe benadering en deelnemende regering  herbevestig.  In  2000  is
die DA gevorm in die hoop  dat  Suid-Afrika  se  vernaamste  opposisiepartye
saam  'n  konstruktiewe  alternatief  vir  die  ANC-Regering  sou  kon  bou.
Ongelukkig het ervaring getoon dat die DP-element  in  die  DA  meer  daarin
belang gestel het om 'n negatiewe opposisie  te  wees,  en  politieke  punte
teen die Regering te verdien, eerder as om te help om  Suid-Afrika  te  maak
werk. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[During the 1999 elections  the  New  NP  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  a
constructive approach and participatory government. The  DA  was  formed  in
2000 in the hope that  South  Africa's  most  prominent  opposition  parties
would jointly be able  to  build  a  constructive  alternative  to  the  ANC
Government. Unfortunately, experience has shown that the DP element  in  the
DA was more interested in being a negative opposition and scoring  political
points against the Government than in helping to make South Africa work.]
This was not what we had expected and had in mind. We could  not  share  the
DP's attitude that what was bad for South Africa was good for the DP/DA.  We
believe that all South Africa's people must  work  together  and  all  South
Africa's public representatives must act in the best interests  of  all  our
people and our whole  nation,  and  not  only  the  narrow  interests  of  a
specific  segment  of  our  people  or  a  specific  constituency  or  their
particular political parties, if we are to achieve the best for our  country
and for our people.

During the 2000 local government elections many councillors from the New  NP
were elected under the  DA  banner.  The  DP/DP  will  now  say  that  these
councillors cannot cross the floor to the New NP because they do not have  a
mandate to do so. That would be a lie. Councillors have  a  moral  right  to
join the New NP.

In nearly all democracies worldwide it is more than just acceptable,  it  is
the established practice that public  representatives  are  free  to  change
party affiliation when their conscience leaves them no other choice or  when
they believe it to be in the national interest.  In  fact,  councillors  who
cross the floor to the New NP will do so because the DA has broken trust  on
its two most important promises in  the  2000  local  government  elections.
They promised to be a party for all the people. However, the DA soon  became
a party for only some of the people. What the DP leadership had in mind  was
only a larger DP. Their heart was simply not big enough to have a  place  in
the sun for all the New NP's voters. The DA promised to be the New  NP  plus
the DP.

However, immediately after the  elections  the  DP  started  an  attempt  at
purging New NP leaders. We now look forward  to  welcoming  all  councillors
and public representatives who share our vision, patriotism and  message  of
hope and who want to  make  a  constructive  contribution  to  making  South
Africa work.

DA councillors and DP public representatives have a  clear  choice.  On  the
one hand the DP says that what is bad for South Africa is good for  the  DA.
We say, ``South Africa first''. [Applause.] They have a message of fear  and
we have a message of hope. They believe in ``fight  back  forever''  and  we
say ``building together''. [Applause.] They believe in a home for  some  and
we say a home for all the people. They shout from the sidelines and  we  say
participatory government. They want to go back to the past and we  say:  Let
us move forward together to the future. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  members,
let the screams stop.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, it is indeed  a
marathon year full of challenges for all of us, as we are  tasked  by  South
Africans to insist on the paramountcy of transformation  on  the  agenda  of
society and Government, and full of inspiration as we see how  the  majority
of our people, while still living in squalor, disease and pain, rise to  the
challenge and walk hand in hand with Government to create a better life  for
all.
The  Local  Government:  Municipal  Structures  Amendment  Bill  before   us
proposes to amend paragraphs  (c)  and  (f)  of  section  27  of  the  Local
Government: Municipal Structures Act, Act 117 of 1998. This is  due  to  the
fact  that  the  proposed  constitutional  amendments  will   render   these
paragraphs redundant.

These amendments stem from the consideration of the  Loss  or  Retention  of
Membership of National and Provincial Legislatures  Bill,  which  creates  a
mechanism in terms of which members of the National Assembly  or  provincial
legislatures can change their party membership without losing  their  seats,
since at present the Constitution does not provide for  similar  changes  of
party membership, mergers between parties or the subdivision of  parties  in
the context of  the  local  government  sphere.  The  department  propose  a
constitutional amendment in respect of the  local  government  sphere  which
deals comprehensively with crossing the floor, the mergers  of  parties  and
the subdivision of parties within the municipal councils,  the  Constitution
of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Bill, which was deliberated on  by
this House a few weeks ago.

This Bill also proposes other amendments to the Local Government:  Municipal
Structures Act of 1998 to  give  effect  to  the  constitutional  amendments
which  require  the  reconstitution  of  structures  and  committees  of   a
municipal  council  in  the  event  of  the  reconstitution   of   a   local
municipality's representation in the district municipality.

Furthermore  this  Bill  will  also  regulate  the  following.  Firstly,  it
provides for the term of office of local government representatives  in  the
district  municipality  in  the  event  of  there  being  a  change  in  the
composition of the councils. Secondly, it regulates  the  first  meeting  of
the council after the change of membership,  or  merger  or  subdivision  of
parties. Thirdly, it redetermines the size of a metropolitan subcouncil  and
the allocation of councillors to those seats.  Fourthly,  it  regulates  the
submission  of  party  lists.  Lastly,  it  provides  for  any  transitional
arrangements.

This Bill is monumental in that local government is also the  immediate  and
sometimes the only point of contact between citizen and Government. This  is
the sphere of government where we can only say that it  is  the  facilitator
of government, for it is local government which makes land available, be  it
for  housing,  industry,  tourism  or  recreation.  It  is  therefore   this
importance that necessitated the amendment of  the  Constitution  so  as  to
bring  local  government  into  line  with  the  national   and   provincial
legislatures, which were provided for in the Constitution.

We have heard all sorts of comments and  accusations  about  us  creating  a
scenario for marriages of convenience and all such other nonsensical  ideas.
May I put on record that this amendment does not just come out  of  nowhere.
It flows directly, even from 1955, when people never dreamt  that  we  would
have a Government of this nature in this country. People would now come  and
say that there was convenience in 1955 when  people  were  meeting  secretly
and took such decisions. We are implementing those decisions right now.
The  hon  Maloyi  has  highlighted  that  these  amendments  do  not  depart
considerably from the  Constitution  because  during  the  drafting  of  the
Constitution  provision  was  made  for  such  eventualities  that  we   are
implementing. Where is this departure from  the  spirit  and  later  of  the
Constitution? Where is this marriage of convenience?

Those hon members voted for this Constitution and we were there when it  was
being made. They were aware that such an event would arise.  Now  they  come
and scream that we are departing from our mandate. No, we  are  implementing
precisely the mandate that we were given by the people. [Applause.]

Cllr R M MASEDI (Salga): Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members  of  the
Council and special delegates, the last time we stood  at  this  podium  and
spoke on this issue of the crossing of the floor, Salga raised a  number  of
concerns, most of which will be covered in this input.

The Local Government: Municipal Structures Amendment  Bill  deals  with  the
consequences of the constitutional amendments providing for the crossing  of
the floor in municipalities. As my colleague who stood here on the  occasion
on the debate on the constitutional  amendment  stated,  Salga  accepts  the
principle that a councillor who crosses the floor will  retain  his  or  her
seat within the framework of the law,  and  we  wholeheartedly  support  the
legislation.

One of the points we raised during that  debate  was  the  question  of  the
frequency of the crossing. As  Salga  we  were  deeply  concerned  with  the
instability that would  have  been  caused  to  our  municipalities  if  the
crossing of the floor had  been  allowed  to  happen  as  envisaged  in  the
previous drafts of the crossing-of-the-floor bills - that  is,  in  February
and September of each year in the second,  third  and  fourth  year  between
elections.

As Salga we are happy  to  note  that  our  concerns  have  been  given  due
consideration and that the crossing of the floor will  only  take  place  in
September of  the  second  and  fourth  year  between  the  elections,  thus
creating the land of stability required to  advance  democracy,  development
and effective delivery of  services  at  the  local  sphere  of  government.
September is also appropriate because it comes after the annual adoption  of
municipal budgets in July, and  so  the  crossing  will  not  undermine  the
crucial budget adoption process.

We are also happy that the disparity or the inconsistencies of the  crossing
between the ward and provincial councillors  have  been  addressed.  We  are
satisfied that all the councillors are going to be treated  the  same  under
the new legislation.

Our system of a developmentally oriented local government is  new  and  must
therefore be  nurtured.  We  cannot  allow  a  system  to  be  fundamentally
tampered with, resulting in instability, little or no service  delivery  and
ultimately the disillusionment of the very people we are supposed to serve.

The current electoral system in the Local Government:  Municipal  Structures
Act is very closely linked to the model of local government. The  model  was
significantly based on the prohibition of  floor  crossing.  In  respect  of
both the constitutional amendment and the amendment of the principal Act  by
this Bill, there has been a concern to provide for floor-crossing in  a  way
that does not erode the foundations of the new model  of  local  government,
especially the concepts of democracy underpinning it.

We therefore believe that the suite of legislation that would  regulate  the
crossing of the floor by councillors will contribute to the  development  of
our fledgling local government system. It  will  bring  stability  to  those
councils where difficulties  have  been  experienced  as  a  result  of  the
internal party-political dynamics.

The provisions to allow for the crossing of the floor have consequences  for
the composition of district councils,  metropolitan  subcouncils  and  other
municipal structures and committees. Among other matters the  Bill  provides
for the reconstitution  of  metropolitan  subcouncils  in  terms  of  a  new
formula that makes provision for floor-crossing.

Whilst  it  is  difficult  at  this  stage  to  fully  anticipate  all   the
consequences that the crossing of the floor will have for  local  government
structures, Salga will monitor developments closely and  will  not  hesitate
to return to this forum should insurmountable  difficulties  be  experienced
in the implementation of the legislation.

We would also urge the Department of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  to
play  a  full  and  effective  role  in  ensuring  that  all  the  practical
consequences  of  floor  crossing  are  catered  for  through   legislation,
including regulations. We cannot afford to find  ourselves  in  a  position,
three or  four  months  down  the  line,  where  councils  are  involved  in
protracted litigation as a result of inconsistent application of the law.

Similarly, the provisions on  crossing  the  floor  also  confer  additional
responsibilities on the Independent Electoral  Commission.  Salga  therefore
urges the IEC to put the necessary infrastructure and  procedures  in  place
to ensure that the provisions of item  7  of  the  new  Schedule  6  (a)  as
provided for in the Constitution of the Republic of South  Africa  Amendment
Bill could be implemented smoothly in the local government sphere.

Salga notes further, and with appreciation, the  efforts  by  the  Portfolio
Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  in  compiling  the
following  pro  forma  notices:  firstly,  the  notice  to   the   electoral
commission; secondly, change of membership of a party; thirdly,  becoming  a
member of a party; and lastly, ceasing to be a member of a party.  It  would
be  the  absence  of  such  pro  forma  notices  that  may  result  in   the
inconsistent application of the law and resultant court challenges.

We must continue building our local government system. We must  continuously
seek new and imaginative ways of delivering on  our  election  promises.  We
must do so without sacrificing the principles  of  democracy  that  underpin
our system of government. We must continue tirelessly  in  these  endeavours
so that we may  ultimately  realise  a  better  life  for  all  our  people.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, there are  very  many  anomalies  left  in  this
legislation which need clarification, and I am  therefore  pleased  to  hear
what the Minister had to say in his introductory remarks.

Take, for example,  the  unfairness  of  a  provincial  parliamentarian  who
changes his or her mind and crosses  the  floor.  This  parliamentarian  not
only changes the mind of the 35 000 or so voters that put him or her  there,
but also, by force majeure, then could change the mind or endanger the  seat
of the member  of  the  NCOP  of  the  same  political  party,  thus  doubly
frustrating the views of the electorate, I  ask  the  Minister  to  look  at
that, please.

We are not against the principle of crossing the floor at all. What  we  are
against at the moment is the prematureness of this measure, given  the  fact
that the Slabbert commission has  just  been  appointed  and  currently  has
already started hearings on the subject.  In  fact,  my  party  has  already
appeared before them, as have other parties.

As Slabbert himself said - or Idasa said,  in  recent  hearings  before  the
House - to finalise  the  provisions  of  the  membership  Bill  before  the
Slabbert commission has offered its recommendations would, in  our  opinion,
pre-empt the matter, in effect putting the cart before the horse.  We  agree
with that.

We also think that it is premature. We think the legislation is designed  to
meet the short-term needs of a particular political party,  and  we  do  not
think it is right to tinker with the Constitution in that way.  In  fact  it
is a precedent that we believe could later come back to haunt us.

Thirdly,  we  are  concerned  about  the  indecent  haste  in  ramming   the
legislation through when its consequences have  not  been  dealt  with.  For
example, in the case of a departing member who loses his  or  her  seat  and
the  money  to  support  that  seat,  who  deals  with  the  liabilities  or
contingent liabilities that he or she  leaves  behind  -  the  lease  for  a
constituency office, hire-purchase agreements, staff and so on?  That  is  a
matter I think will also have to be considered.

We are not against the principle of crossing the floor. We think,  in  fact,
that it could be a useful tool in a democratically  elected,  representative
parliament,  but  not  with  the  current  list   system   of   proportional
representation that we have as it is  currently  constituted.  That  is  our
view. It is significant that our  view  is  shared  by  other  authoritative
bodies, for example the  IEC  itself,  which  said  recently  when  it  gave
evidence before  the  committee  that  there  were  problems  and  that  the
instability created by  crossing  the  floor  and  by  parties  merging  and
subdividing would  be,  and  I  quote,  ``much  worse  than  nationally  and
provincially at local government level''. The IEC added:


  There  are  a  substantial  number  of  smaller  parties  represented  in
  municipal councils, as well as a relatively large number of hung councils
  where no one party holds an  absolute  majority.  This  instability  will
  undoubtedly filter through to district councils and local councils.

Salga themselves said in their evidence that even three times in five  years
will cause instability. We agree that that could create instability.

We also have no less an authority  than  the  Constitutional  Court  itself.
[Time expired.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL:  Chairperson, I think the member  is  very  fortunate.  I
wanted to ask him a question, but fortunately his time ran out.

Mr J F AULSEBROOK (KwaZulu-Natal): Mr Chairman,  I  must  begin  by  stating
that the legislature of KwaZulu-Natal, by a simple majority,  supported  the
section 74 and 76 Bill, but I will express the views of  the  three  parties
that opposed the Bill in our legislature, which went to a  division  in  the
House. Those parties were the ACDP, the UDM and the IFP. I want to  make  it
very clear the position that I occupy here today.

Please allow me once again  to  briefly  motivate  our  stand  in  principle
against these Bills. In the 1999 election, not a single representative,  MPP
or MP, in the Republic of South Africa received  a  single  vote.  No  one's
name appeared on any ballot papers. Not one of those public  representatives
can prove that they received a single vote. The voters voted  for  political
parties  on  the  basis  of  their  policies,  their  principles  and  their
collective leadership.

I challenge any member of the House to prove otherwise.  The  names  on  the
ballot paper were the names of political parties. This proves that  we  were
all democratically elected in the system we have  in  this  country  through
our parties. We, whose names appeared  on  party  lists,  were  collectively
elected and serve at the grace of our parties. That, whether we like  it  or
not, it is beyond all  doubt  and  is  the  position,  given  our  electoral
system. I ask what it means when we say that we serve  as  a  collective  of
our parties that nominated  us?  In  most  cases  we  were  elected  through
internal democratic processes within our parties.

We now need to  look  at  the  principle  of  the  issue  we  are  debating,
certainly from the perspective of those parties that opposed  it,  which,  I
submit, is contained in the question: What gives the  individual  the  right
to violate the basic principle of representative democracy?  The  answer  is
obvious and very simple. Nothing. An MP has no right to  turn  his  back  on
the voters who voted for his party, no moral right. By turning his  back  on
voters such an MP is telling us, ``I do not care what you think.  I  do  not
care what mandate you gave me. I do not care about you, I  only  care  about
my own selfish position and my own political future.''

Had the electoral system been  different,  if  it  were  constituency-based,
things could, of course, have been viewed very differently. If  an  MP  were
elected in a constituency where the voters voted especially for him or  her,
that would be a very different story. Voters from  a  member's  constituency
who  elected  that  member  may  be  consulted  and  may  then  support  the
individual's crossing of the floor. In  that  case  crossing  of  the  floor
would be the  right  thing  to  do  and  morally  justifiable.  But  if  the
electorate does not support members' crossing, then those MPs and MPPs  will
soon discover that it is a short  cut  to  ending  their  political  career.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  there  is  so
much noise in that corner that we  cannot  hear  Mr  Aulsebrook.  Would  the
member please continue.

Mr J F AULSEBROOK: Why do I mention this, as it is not applicable to us  MPs
and MPPs? Purely because there are those who argue  that  nearly  all  First
World democracies - we have heard that in this House from  two  members  who
spoke earlier - provide for crossing the floor in  their  legislation.  That
may be true, but they fail to acknowledge that it  takes  place  within  the
parameters of a very different electoral system.

Given what I have said, I am rather surprised that the  ex-DP  component  of
the DA has seen fit to support this legislation. I would have  thought  that
they would share the view that if an MP or MPP were dissatisfied with  their
party, they would do the right thing and resign.

Now let us turn to local government, where a similar Bill provides  for  the
crossing of the floor. It is turning certain municipalities into a merry-go-
round of political prostitution.

We are aware that this amendment within our  given  electoral  system  would
open the door for the  undemocratic  behaviour  that  is  being  experienced
currently at municipal level, and we have heard that  from  members  of  all
parties here. Public representatives have generally not been  held  in  very
high esteem by the electorate in this country, although  we  have  all  been
working hard at improving that image.  Indiscreet  behaviour  by  individual
members, regardless of their political party,  usually  reflects  negatively
on all the members. This legislation could exacerbate  the  problem  -  that
is, the public negative perception of public representatives.

The second principle on which we oppose this Bill is the ad  hoc  manner  in
which the Constitution is being changed and dealt with.  In  this  case  the
motivation for this change appears to be more for political expediency  than
to improve the democracy of this country. [Time expired.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  know  some
members do not like some of the comments, but a member  must  be  given  the
opportunity to address the House.

Mr N V E NGIDI (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, in 1996 the  IFP  went  to  the
Constitutional Court and called  the  antidefection  clause  immoral.  Today
they are  standing  in  this  House  and  calling  the  laws  that  regulate
defection immoral. Where do they stand?  [Interjections.]  It  is  with  the
greatest pleasure that I rise to support the Bills regulating  the  crossing
of the floor.

I believe  that  if  these  Bills  become  law,  democracy  will  have  been
entrenched in this country. I believe that the pillars of freedom for  which
we fought for so long and sacrificed so much will be cast in  iron.  Members
of Parliament, provincial legislatures and local government will taste  real
freedom. For the first time they will be able to belong to parties of  their
choice without any fear.

These Bills herald the end of the suffocating grip that  party  bosses  have
over their membership. No longer must a person remain in a party  even  when
his or her conscience dictates otherwise. Members of Parliament will now  be
able to follow their conscience and  leave  a  party  that  is  patently  no
longer true to the ideals and principles that attracted that member to  that
party in the first place.

The Bills are particularly  good  for  KwaZulu-Natal.  This  is  a  province
where,  at  times,  when  one  decides  to  follow  the  dictates  of  one's
conscience, dire consequences visit one. Killing those who change  political
allegiance will no longer benefit anyone as the death of a member  will  not
bring back the seat to the party that has lost it. Inherent  to  this  Bill,
therefore, is the protection of lives. Furthermore, the DP  will  no  longer
subject its members to lie-detector test to ensure their loyalty.

Those opposed to the Bill have  argued  that  the  Bills  will  bring  about
instability in South African politics.  Nothing  can  be  further  from  the
truth. Firstly, crossing the floor  can  only  take  place  twice  within  a
parliamentary term. During the present term it will take  place  only  once.
Secondly, crossing of the floor can only happen  after  a  year  has  passed
after general elections. The Bills have safety valves to ensure stability.

Another argument put forward even more forcefully is that the Bills  distort
the will of the electorate. When voters exercise their right to  vote,  they
do so on the basis of issues. They do not vote for political  parties  based
on a whim or inexplicable fancy, but do so on the basis of a programme  that
a party puts forward in its election manifesto. Voters then  expect  parties
to do specific things in Parliament, if the party veers away  from  what  it
promised, the electorate will withdraw its  support.  The  same  right  must
therefore be afforded to members of Parliament. Why should anyone be  forced
to remain in an unhappy marriage.

It has also been argued that the Bills are a result of the events  that  are
unfolding in the Western Cape and the desire of the ruling party to  control
the province. I have my doubts as  to  the  veracity  of  these  claims.  My
doubts are based on my knowledge of debates  that  have  been  taking  place
within the ruling party. I would therefore hold the view  that  the  Western
Cape events may have  precipitated  the  process,  but  definitely  did  not
initiate it.

Even if there is truth in these arguments,  I  believe  that  the  worth  of
these Bills cannot be judged on what is happening in the Western Cape  only.
These are not Western-Cape-only Bills; they have national  application.  The
architects of these Bills must have looked at the national picture. We  need
to agree that these Bills deepen and entrench  democracy  in  this  country.
Beside crossing the floor it is going to affect not only one party, but  all
parties.

By the way, events that are unfolding in Western  Cape  started  just  after
the 1999 elections, not when we started debating these Bills.  South  Africa
is not the only country where crossing of the floor takes place.  India  may
be  the  only  country  now  that  still  prohibits  defections  within  its
political system. Recently in the USA,  a  Republican  senator  who  was  no
longer happy with George W Bush's policies crossed the  floor,  moving  away
from the Republican Party and there was no train smash.

I believe that we should embrace these  Bills,  for  their  time  has  come.
[Applause.]
Mnr C ACKERMANN: Mnr die Voorsitter, hierdie pakket van  wetgewing  lei  nog
'n nuwe era en 'n opwindende era in die  Suid-Afrikaanse  politiek  in.  Die
Wes-Kaap steun dit met geesdrif. Alhoewel neergekyk word op  Afrikaregerings
en  hoe  hulle   die   demokrasie   toepas,   staan   Suid-Afrika   op   die
spreekwoordelike  bogrond,  die  rots   van   Gibraltar   wat   betref   ons
konstitusionele ontwikkeling. Trouens, ons is verskeie lande ver vooruit  op
hierdie gebied  en  ons  word  toenemend  beskou  as  'n  rolmodel  waarheen
onderontwikkelde lande op konstitusionele gebied kan beweeg.

Suid-Afrikaners kan opreg  trots  wees  op  ons  land  se  prestasie  om  'n
Grondwet daar te stel wat nie alleen eie aan die Afrikabodem  is  nie,  maar
wat ook  die  toon  aangee  in  ontwikkelende  lande  en  selfs  in  moderne
demokrasieë.   Ons   eie   voorsitter   se   toespraak   by    die    eerste
Wêreldkonferensie van Tweede Kamers in Parys het hierdie impak van die Suid-
Afrikaanse model bevestig. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C  ACKERMANN:  Mr  Chairman,  this  package  of  legislation  introduces
another new and exciting era in South African  politics.  The  Western  Cape
supports it with enthusiasm. Although African governments and the manner  in
which  they  apply  democracy  are  disparaged,  South  Africa  is  on   the
proverbial high ground, the rock of Gibraltar concerning our  constitutional
development. As a matter of fact, we are far ahead of several  countries  in
this  field  and  we  are  increasingly  viewed  as  a  role   model   which
underdeveloped countries can emulate in the constitutional sphere.

South Africans can  truly  be  proud  of  our  country's  accomplishment  of
creating a Constitution that is  not  only  peculiar  to  the  territory  of
Africa, but is also a leading example in developing countries  and  even  in
modern  democracies.  Our  own  chairperson's  speech  at  the  first  World
Conference of Second Chambers in Paris confirmed this impact  of  the  South
African model.]

This package of legislation will, of course, have  a  major  impact  on  the
present political scene in  South  Africa.  Constitution  and  constitution-
making is a process and therefore not static. Realignment in  South  African
politics is a given; it is a certainty, and  therefore  the  need  for  this
legislation to create a stable democracy to serve South Africa first.

I have no doubt that this legislation will probably have a great  impact  on
the Western Cape local government, both positive  and  negative  impacts  on
the DP-Democratic Alliance. On the positive  side,  the  Cape  Town  unicity
will be free of the shackles of the present DP/DA leadership.

I am prepared to give a 100:1 bet that Gerald Morkel will be removed as  the
mayor of the Unicity of Cape Town. [Applause.] Who wants  Gerald  Morkel  in
any  case?  This  is  the  latest  report  from  Sapa  today  on  the  Desai
commission, and I want to read it to hon members:


  Alleged German fraudster Jürgen Harksen has claimed that Gerald  Morkel's
  lawyer phoned him on the eve of his latest  round  of  testimony  to  the
  Desai commission, urging him to stick to a particular version  of  events
  ... The commission's leader of evidence, Adv Webster, reported back  soon
  after that a number the call  came  from  was  apparently  that  of  Paul
  Katzeff, Morkel's attorney. ``He told me I  must  stick  to  the  version
  (that) I have not given money to Morkel's court case,'' Harksen told  the
  commission. ``In other words Mr Katzeff was telling you to  lie?''  asked
  Adv Peter Hodes, who is appearing for Morkel and the Democratic Alliance.
  ``To use your words, yes,'' replied Harksen.

Here is another report from the SA Broadcasting Corporation:


  Jürgen Harksen, German fugitive and alleged fraudster, today said he  was
  prepared to spill the beans on  links  between  Gerald  Morkel  and  Vito
  Palazzolo, alleged Mafia kingpin.

So who wants Morkel, who is dancing with  the  Mafia  and  disregarding  the
rule of law in South Africa? [Interjections.]
The DP/DA is too scared to get rid of Gerald Morkel because they are  afraid
he will spill the beans and expose Tony Leon. [Interjections.]

If that party does not want to serve Cape Town's interests and  if  they  do
not want to serve South  Africa's  interests,  the  representatives  of  the
people  in  Parliament  will  do  so   by   supporting   this   legislation.
[Interjections.]

South Africa does not deserve a leader of the opposition  and  DA/DP  leader
who regularly drags South African politics  through  mud  baths.  I  am  now
reading for the House from statements, statements  by  Tony  Leon.  His  own
deputy leader, a black person who was  a  distinguished  colleague  of  this
House - what does Mr Leon say about William Mnisi? ``DP leader Tony Leon  on
Wednesday turned on his former deputy, William Mnisi, for defecting  to  the
NP, describing him as a confused and bedraggled rat, who had clambered  onto
a sinking ship.'' [Interjections.]

Here is another quote from Hansard in Parliament, on the  late  Minister  of
Safety and Security. What does he say about that  Minister?  He  said:  ``It
sends into the Ministry of Safety and Security a buffoon, a blusterer and  a
bully to go and fix it.'' Next is what he said about the President of  South
Africa - on the President of South Africa, by the Leader of the  Opposition!
- ``Mr Mbeki is treating the DA like he  treats  anyone  and  anything  that
gets in his way. He is a ruthless man who does not like  to  be  thwarted.''
[Interjections.]

This is a shame: to say that the President  is  a  ruthless  man;  that  the
senior Minister of Safety and Security is a buffoon; that his  own  previous
deputy leader, a black person, is a bedraggled rat.  We  need  leaders  that
deserve respect in South  Africa,  not  fight-backs  clouded  with  personal
smears. [Interjections.]

Through his actions he has placed a question mark over all  politicians  and
put them in a  bad  light.  This  is  not  acceptable.  The  realignment  of
opposition politics can only benefit if this legislation makes it  possible.
South Africa needs  more  respectable  opposition.  It  needs  participatory
government.  It  needs  contributing  to  the  Government  from   opposition
benches, whilst maintaining the right to differ.

But, on the other hand, this legislation will also have  a  negative  effect
on politicians. Those who decide to stay  in  the  DP-DA  will  have  a  big
surprise. I predict today that councillors who stay  in  the  DP  will  soon
have a letter from the national chairperson, Mr James Selfe, or  maybe  from
the hon Krumbock, telling them to give up to 10% of their  gross  salary  to
the party. [Interjections.] Where will they get the funds to pay  all  their
legal costs that are jumping into the hundreds of thousands of rands?  Where
will they get money  to  pay  their  overdraft,  according  to  reports,  of
millions of rands? Where will they get money for their  extravagant  rallies
and meetings where they rent crowds and bus them in?  [Interjections.]  They
want to create perceptions of  a  party  that  is  enjoying  their  support.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr L M Mushwana): Order! I see  you  are
jumping up like popcorn; you do not want to sit down.  [Laughter.]  Can  you
settle down, hon members, and just listen.

Mr C ACKERMANN: The  South  African  official  opposition,  the  DP/DA,  has
become a dishonour for our young democracy. May this legislation lead  to  a
broader representation of different race groups in  political  parties.  The
Western Cape will play a  positive  role  to  bring  about  a  better  South
Africa. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I only wish that today's  debate
was broadcast live for the nation to hear the impassioned  plea  of  members
of the New NP seeking to be released from this bondage which  they  describe
eloquently as immoral. It would be immoral if  the  majority  party,  having
noted  the  plea  and  having  noted  the  circumstances   which   subjected
councillors and public representatives to this - what  they  describe  as  -
``immoral'' bondage, to turn their back and say, ``Well, we have no role  in
it. We do not want to shape the political discourse of  the  future.  We  do
not want to alter the landscape in such  a  way  that  we  could  perpetuate
nation-building and reconciliation''.

Mr Lever has quite conveniently alluded to the marriage between the ANC  and
the New NP. What he has forgotten to tell this House is about the  estranged
relationship or the divorce that has occurred between the  New  NP  and  the
DA. That marriage was, in fact, consummated. It assumed a new  and  separate
name, which is the  cause  of  the  misery  and  remorse  that  members  are
suffering today, and it became very clear, not out of the  evidence  that  I
produced or adduced in this House, but from the  words  of  Mr  Matthee:  We
wanted to move  forward;  they  wanted  to  move  backwards.  We  wanted  to
reconcile and build; they wanted to alienate and  destroy.  [Interjections.]
Certainly, those were constructive grounds for a legitimate  and  reasonable
divorce. We commend the New NP for initiating the  divorce  proceedings  and
bringing some sanity to the political terrain. [Applause.]  [Interjections.]


I heard with interest the comments by Mr  J  Aulsebrook  from  the  KwaZulu-
Natal delegation. One  will  note  from  the  speakers'  list  that  he  was
speaking as a spokesperson for his province. He is duly  mandated  in  terms
of its rules and in terms of the Constitution to be a spokesperson for  that
particular legislature. And  within  the  constitutional  framework  of  the
National Council of Provinces and its relationship  with  the  legislatures,
it  is  very  clear  that  permanent  delegates,  on  issues   that   affect
legislation which affect the provinces, speak as mandated representatives.

Now I find it rather rather extraordinary when a  legislature,  through  its
own mechanisms, through  its  own  internal  rules,  develops  a  particular
process in which that mandate is conferred. It does so, in  the  context  of
KwaZulu-Natal,  as  follows:  Where  there  is  not  75%  agreement  in  the
committee regarding the support of legislation, it would  refer  the  matter
to plenary where a vote would be taken and the will of  the  majority  would
prevail. That is the democratic process to which the IFP, the  ANC  and  all
political parties subscribe, notwithstanding this democratic process.

Mr Aulsebrook finds it rather extraordinary. I find it beyond  comprehension
that he would come here now, given the fact that the will of  the  democracy
had been expressed in the legislature in relation to this  legislation,  and
put a position that is adverse to that taken in  the  legislature.  This  is
the kind of latitude we should not tolerate in the context of  matters  that
affect a province.

If, at all, Mr Aulsebrook came and approached the Chief Whip and  said,  ``I
would, on behalf of the IFP, wish to put forward a particular view which  is
adverse to that of the mandate that was conferred to me'', certainly in  the
process of our democracy and in the  manner  that  is  consistent  with  our
democracy, we would have permitted such articulation of the  views,  however
ineloquent they may have been.

I think what is central to this debate is  a  lack  of  understanding  of  a
constitutional provision, which was referred to by the hon  Mr  Nona  Maloyi
and by the chairperson of the  Select  Committee  on  Local  Government  and
Administration. This is that, in terms of the Constitution, any crossing  of
the floor could occur by virtue of national legislation which may be  passed
within a reasonable  time.  The  Constitution  quite  clearly  sets  certain
thresholds for certain amendments. If it is, for example,  an  amendment  to
section 1 of the Constitution, a 75% majority is required.

If it is a Bill of Rights amendment, one  requires  a  two-thirds  majority.
Yet when it comes to  an  amendment  to  the  electoral  process  to  permit
crossing of the floor, one  requires  a  simple  majority  and  not  even  a
constitutional  amendment.  If  at  all  these  members  were  true  to  the
Constitution and subscribed to its values,  they  would  not  be  surprised.
Given the background, given  the  fact  that  they  previously  vociferously
opposed the ANC when it said that it would not allow crossing of  the  floor
and wanted to retain a pure PR system, given the  fact  that  that  was  the
position of both the IFP and the DP, to now suggest that  this  relationship
is tainted or immoral is somewhat beyond my understanding.

I think the House has spoken. It is very clear and evident that these  Bills
have to be supported. May I conclude  by  saying  that  the  NCOP,  in  this
particular process, reached out to the nine provincial legislatures as  well
as  local  government  structures.  What  we  have  here  in  terms  of  our
amendments, particularly with regard to the frequency  of  the  crossing  of
the floor, the timing when it should occur, is in fact a reflection  of  our
interaction with provincial  legislatures  and  local  government.  We  must
build on that exercise.

Furthermore, it was very heartening to  listen  to  Salga  participating  in
such a meaningful way in this debate. We want to draw attention to the  fact
that, given the interest that was shown by local government  delegations  in
the various provinces, we would like to dedicate the next  provincial  week,
8-13 November, to purely local government  issues  and  we  would  like  the
local government associations to join hands with the NCOP  in  reaching  out
to the various legislatures, as  partners  in  identifying,  discussing  and
debating various issues and challenges that confront local government.  With
these words, I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson,  thank
you very much. I am rising essentially to thank hon  members  for  what  has
been a very good and successful debate on these Bills. However,  it  becomes
unavoidable to make a few observations in respect of  some  of  the  remarks
that were made in this House.

Regarding the remarks by Kgoshi Mokoena, I agree with them  totally.  It  is
improper in the extreme on the part of anybody to  circulate  forms  and  go
around intimidating public representatives in the vain hope that  they  will
not defect from parties that are doing this. We would want to  believe  that
all decent party representatives are going  to  insist  that  their  parties
desist from doing this kind of thing.

Secondly, a remark relating to the pensions  buy-back.  Unfortunately,  this
law cannot entertain that. It is not the right place, therefore,  to  debate
that, but if it does arise as an issue, the hon members who  feel  concerned
that they could be entitled to this benefit should  make  sure  that  it  is
appropriately discussed.

I think we must commend the IFP for  doing  what  I  believe  is  the  right
thing, namely participating in a constitutional debate. All along they  have
been boycotting such debates. At the same time,  if  we  respond  by  simply
denying the passing of this sort of  legislation,  we  are  sacrificing  our
morality on the altar of political expediency.

The hon member has reminded us that in 1996 the same argument  was  made  by
the IFP to the Constitutional Court, but the wind was blowing in  a  totally
different direction. In other words, one acts immorally by not doing it  and
one acts immorally by doing it. I would want to  be  addressed  one  day  on
this obvious inconsistency. We are not  acting  unconstitutionally,  but  we
are doing what the Constitution says we may do. The  Constitution  itself  -
quite wisely, so it turns out - says that we may pass legislation, and  that
is exactly what we are doing. No court of law, including the  Constitutional
Court, would find that we are acting unconstitutionally by doing that.

I want to help those who are much younger than I am to  understand  the  DP.
It has a very interesting and chequered history. Many moons ago,  they  were
indeed opposed to universal suffrage in  this  country  and,  instead,  they
were advocates and  preachers  of  the  gospel  of  a  race-based  qualified
franchise   for   blacks.   [Interjections.]   White   hobos   without   the
qualifications that Dr  Mandela  has  qualified  merely  because  they  were
white. Mandela had to have a certain standard of education,  be  a  property
owner, according to them.

Recently they were screaming blue  murder  on  media  allegations  regarding
what was happening in Zimbabwe between the government and judges. When  they
do the same thing, we are supposed to scream, ``Hallelujah! It is right  now
to do so!'' Again, when not so long ago, we were actually  saying  that  the
law  enforcement  agencies  must  investigate  certain  allegations  against
members of the ANC, such as Toni Yengeni, they screamed that it  was  right.
When the spotlight tended to shift in their direction, it was  wrong.  There
is manipulation and abuse, without telling the country who  is  responsible.
[Applause.]

More than that, they are then saying that - it is quite correct, by the  way
- due process requirements apply to all. They never had the decency  to  say
that even those members of the  ANC  who  had  been  investigated  were  not
guilty till proven so. They were guilty until  they  could  establish  their
own innocence, according to  the  DP.  This  is  sheer  nonsense  and  sheer
inconsistency. Again, it is characteristic of the DP.

Lastly, it is interesting that in this day and age, when indeed we  want  to
believe that we as a country have consciously turned our backs  on  whatever
the past represented, they still use spies and things like that.  If  it  is
true that what they were doing here extended to the violation  of  the  law,
it goes without saying that those who were running  those  spy  circles  and
intercepting people's communications will have to pay. It is criminal to  do
so under the law, unless one is part of an entity that is recognised by  law
as having the authority to do so and  one  is  doing  so  on  the  basis  of
permission by a judge and it relates to particular  offences  as  listed  in
the annexure to the law. If one is going beyond that, one is  guilty  of  an
offence.

They were doing it here, even buying machines to spy on us here, because  we
are within the four kilometre radius. Things that they  were  frowning  upon
as long as they were done by other people,  allegedly,  are  being  done  by
them here. Again, subjecting duly elected members of this  House  and  other
legislatures to lie detectors is  something  which  does  not  belong  in  a
democracy. [Interjections.] I want to  believe  it  belongs  elsewhere,  but
then again, they are being consistent. The old saying tells  us:  A  leopard
will never change its spots. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  shall  now
put the question in respect of the first order. The  question  is  that  the
Bill, B17B-2002, and the amendments in  B17C-2002  be  agreed  to.  As  this
decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the  Constitution,  I  need
to ascertain very clearly  whether  delegation  heads  are  present.  Can  I
ascertain in the Eastern Cape? Where is  the  delegation  head?  Thank  you.
Free State? Gauteng? KwaZulu-Natal? Mpumalanga? Thank  you.  Northern  Cape?
Northern Province? North West? Western Cape? [Interjections.] Thank you.

I shall now also allow provinces the opportunity to make  their  declaration
in terms of Rule 71 if they so wish. Is there any province wishing  to  make
any declaration of vote? There is obviously none.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the  question.  I  shall  do  this  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against  or  abstain  from  voting.

terms of section 74(3)(b) of the Constitution.

I shall now put the question in respect of the second  order.  The  question
is that Bill B25-2002 and the amendments in B25A-2002 be agreed to.  I  have
already ascertained that delegation heads are present. Any province  willing
to make a declaration of vote? There is none. We shall  once  again  proceed
to voting on the question. Please  indicate  whether  you  vote  in  favour,
abstain or against. Eastern Cape?

in favour. [Applause.] I therefore  declare  the  Bill  and  the  amendments
agreed to in terms of section 65 of the Constitution.

We now come to the question with respect to the third  order.  The  question
is that the Bill be agreed to. In accordance with  Rule  63  I  shall  first
allow political parties the opportunity to make their  declaration  of  vote
if they so wish. Any political party? There is none. We  shall  now  proceed
to the voting on the question. Those in favour will say ``Aye''.

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Those  against  will
say ``No''. I think the ayes have it. The majority of members have voted  in
favour. I therefore declare the Bill agreed to in terms  of  section  75  of
the Constitution.

On that note, that will conclude the business of the day and  the  House  is
adjourned.

The Council adjourned at 17:02.
