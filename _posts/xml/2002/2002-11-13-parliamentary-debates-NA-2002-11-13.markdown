                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The SPEAKER: Before proceeding to the peace and security cluster,  there  is
a ruling I wish to make which concerns the hon Mr Ellis.  Hon  members  will
recall that during the debate on the Broadcasting Bill on 23  October  2002,
the hon Mr Ellis took  up  a  point  of  order  and  asked  whether  it  was
permissible for the hon  Mr  Kekana  to  refer  to  a  party  as  racist.  I
undertook to check the Hansard. I have done so, and I should  like  to  rule
on the point of order as follows: Mr Kekana's  remark,  as  it  appeared  in
Hansard is, and I quote: ``The DP is guided by racist and reactionary  views
such as those of a Dr Albert Hertzog.'' The reference is to the  views  that
guide a political party. We have consistently ruled  that  references  to  a
party are not unparliamentary even when those same references may have  been
unparliamentary if they had been directed specifically at  members  of  this
House. The remark is therefore in order. [Applause.]

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr P A GERBER: Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Huis namens die ANC sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat  Ralph  Rabie,  ook  bekend  as  Johannes  Kerkorrel,
       tragies oorlede is;


  (2) erkenning verleen aan sy baanbrekerswerk as woordkunstenaar, waar  hy
       apartheid met woord en noot beveg het, en hom sodoende die wrewel van
       die destydse regering op die hals gehaal het;


  (3) bevestig dat sy sang bygedra het tot die bevryding van die  Afrikaner
       en sy taal;


  (4) hom eer as kameraad en kind van Afrika; en

  Ewige kind van Afrika.

[Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.] (Translation  of  Afrikaans  notice  of  motion
follows.)

[Mr P A GERBER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Ralph Rabie, also known as Johannes  Kerkorrel,  has  died
       tragically;


  (2) recognises his pioneering work as  a  literary  artist,  in  that  he
       fought apartheid with words and music and in so  doing  incurred  the
       resentment of the then government;


  (3) confirms that his music contributed to the liberation  of  Afrikaners
       and their language;


  (4) honours him as a comrade and a child of Africa; and


  (5) expresses its condolences to his next of kin, friends and fans.


  Halala, halala,


  Ewige kind van Afrika.

[Interjections.]] [Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Modulasetulo, ke go itsise gore ke  tlaa  dira  tshitshinyo
[Chairperson, I shall move at the next sitting of the House]:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the Mugabe regime is mainly to blame for the self-infected
       famine and fuel crisis in Zimbabwe;


  (2) strongly believes that  South  Africa  must  assist  the  victims  of
       President Mugabe's disastrous policies; and


  (3) resolves that such  assistance  must  be  subject  to  the  following
       conditions:


       (a)  food relief must be free of government and Zanu-PF  interference
           and manipulation;


       (b)  Zanu-PF heavyweights who have taken over farms must  immediately
           leave the farms, giving preference to the less privileged across
           the spectrum of the Zimbabwean nation;


       (c)  the bilateral agreement must be ratified immediately to  protect
           South African investments in Zimbabwe; and


       (d)  Zanu-PF must return to negotiations with the opposition.
Mr E T FERREIRA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a police sergeant and two other people  were  arrested  in
       Durban for allegedly hijacking a van which contained medicines  worth
       more than R300 000;


  (2) further notes that the hijacking took place after a  bogus  roadblock
       was set up; and


  (3) realises that incidents like this, where the police are  involved  in
       crimes, cause the public to lose faith and confidence in policemen.

Dr A N LUTHULI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -
       (a)  November is celebrated as environmental month  under  the  theme
           ``Partnerships  for  Responsible  Environmental  Management   in
           pushing back the frontiers of poverty''; and


       (b)  this celebration emphasises South Africa's  continued  focus  on
           eradicating  the  legacy  of  racism,  sexism,  colonialism  and
           apartheid and is  centred  on  the  Government's  commitment  to
           integrated sustainable development;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  a clean environment is a human right which  all  South  Africans
           are entitled to and is essential  for  a  better  life  and  the
           realisation of sustainable development; and


       (b)  this month's celebration highlights the need for all the  people
           to forge partnerships  with  the  Government  to  implement  the
           decisions of the World Summit on Sustainable Development; and


  (3) calls on all South Africans to work with the Government  to  build  a
       clean environment and fight poverty.

[Applause.]

Mnr A BLAAS: Voorsitter, hiermee gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Huis namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  generaals in die SANW  weens  bedrog  gearresteer  en  offisiere
           weens swak gedrag aangekla is;


       (b)  die paraatheid van die Weermag in die media bevraagteken word;


       (c)  kundiges in strategie die vermoë van  die  SANW  as  onvoldoende
           bevestig;


       (d)  die Weermag jaarliks  groot  verliese  ly  as  gevolg  van  swak
           administrasie;


       (e)  die dissipline en moraal in die SANW 'n laagtepunt bereik het;


       (f)  te veel onbevoegde en  swak  gekwalifiseerde  personeel  in  die
           Weermag geakkommodeer moet word; en


       (g)   die  rasionalisasieproses  in  die  Weermag  te  lank  neem  om
           afgehandel te word; en


  (2) 'n beroep op die  Regering  doen  om  geld  beskikbaar  te  stel  vir
       uittreepakkette sodat ongeskikte personeel kan aftree  en  die  dooie
       hout uitgekap kan word.

[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  generals in the SANDF have been arrested on charges of fraud and
           officers have been charged with poor conduct;


       (b)  the readiness of the Defence Force is being  questioned  in  the
           media;


       (c)  strategy experts are confirming that the ability of the SANDF is
           inadequate;


       (d)  the Defence Force annually suffers big losses  as  a  result  of
           poor administration;


       (e)  the discipline and morale in the SANDF have reached their lowest
           point;


       (f)  too many incompetent and poorly qualified personnel have  to  be
           accommodated in the Defence Force; and


       (g)  the rationalisation process in the Defence Force is  taking  too
           long to finalise; and


  (2) appeals to the Government  to  make  money  available  for  severance
       packages so that unsuitable personnel can retire and dead wood can be
       hacked out.

[Applause.]]

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns the latest proposed tariff increases announced by Telkom and
       Eskom;


  (2) expresses its concern for the South African  consumer  who,  after  a
       year of rampant escalating food and fuel prices, must  now  bear  the
       brunt of increases in telephone and electricity tariffs;


  (3) acknowledges that these administered prices  contribute  directly  to
       inflation, which therefore makes a mockery of inflation targeting and
       calls by the Government for consumers to tighten their belts;


  (4) condemns the spin-doctoring that Telkom is increasingly engaging  in;
       and


  (5) calls upon the Government and  regulators  to  immediately  institute
       investigations  into  the  perceived  necessity  for   these   tariff
       increases in order to protect the consumer and the economy.

My belt is already tight. [Laughter.]

Mrs B TINTO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Western Cape Department of Education has  launched  an
       employment equity plan to empower  black  people,  women  and  people
       living with disabilities;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  this is a demonstration of the  commitment  of  the  ANC/New  NP
           partnership to transform the Western Cape and build unity  among
           all people in the province; and


       (b)  this reflects the commitment of this  partnership  to  eradicate
           all forms of inequality and poverty in our country; and


  (3) commends the Western Cape Department of  Education  for  unveiling  a
       plan to do away with the inequalities of the past.

[Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD:  Voorsitter,  hiermee  gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting van die Huis namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die gemeenste politieke tegniek  is  om  'n  standpunt  aan  jou
           opponent toe te dig wat hy nooit gehuldig het nie;


       (b)  dit presies is wat mnr Marthinus van Schalkwyk,  Nuwe  NP-leier,
           met die VF probeer doen oor  die  bomaanvalle  -  deur  by  elke
           moontlike geleentheid die  bewering  te  maak  dat  die  VF  die
           bomaanvalle net ``gekwalifiseerd'' veroordeel; en


       (c)  mnr Van Schalkwyk feitelik verkeerd is,  dat  dit  'n  politieke
           leuen is, en dat die VF die bomme en geweld  veroordeel  het  en
           gesê het dat die grondwetlike pad gevolg moet word  om  probleme
           op te los; en


  (2) 'n beroep doen op mnr Van Schalkwyk om eerder argument teen  argument
       te  toets  om  so  respek  vir  politici   terug   te   bring   onder
       Afrikaanssprekendes en kiesers in die algemeen.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the worst political technique is to impute a point  of  view  to
           one's opponent that he never held;


       (b)  this is exactly what Mr Marthinus van Schalkwyk, leader  of  the
           New NP, attempted to do with the FF  with  regard  to  the  bomb
           attacks - by making the allegation at every possible opportunity
           that the FF is only expressing  ``qualified  condemnation''  for
           the bomb attacks; and


       (c)  Mr  Van  Schalkwyk  is  factually  incorrect,  that  this  is  a
           political lie and that  the  FF  has  condemned  the  bombs  and
           violence and has said that the  constitutional  path  should  be
           followed to solve problems;


  (2) appeals to Mr Van Schalkwyk rather to test argument against  argument
       in order to restore respect for politicians among  Afrikaans-speaking
       persons and constituents in general.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  a  media  release  by   the   so-called   Boeremag   claiming
       responsibility  for  the  recent   bomb   attacks   in   Soweto   and
       Bronkhorstspruit; and


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  this media release does not reflect Afrikaner  frustrations  and
           alienation, frequently addressed by the AEB in this  House,  but
           rather a radical and extreme form of pseudoreligious fanaticism,
           as revealed by phrases such as ``the revenge and  the  wrath  of
           the God of  the  Boerevolk''  and  ``warriors  of  our  heavenly
           Father'';


       (b)  Christianity rejects any concept of a so-called ``holy war'', as
           clearly demonstrated by Jesus Christ  when  He  said  to  Peter:
           ``Put your sword back in its place, for all who draw  the  sword
           will die by the sword''; the  only  sword  of  Christians  being
           described in Ephesians 6 as ``the sword of the Spirit, which  is
           the word of God'';


       (c)  God cannot be  nationalised  by  any  single  ``volk'',  but  He
           gathers his children from all the nations on earth; and


       (d)  this declaration should not be  generalised  as  reflecting  the
           view of either Afrikaners or Christians  in  South  Africa,  the
           vast majority of whom are committed to the  peaceful  resolution
           of the challenges facing our country.

[Applause.]
Ms P N MNANDI: Chairperson of Chairs, I hereby give notice that on the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  IBM(SA) handed  over  ten  Kidsmart  computers  to  the  African
           Selfhelp Association on  12  November  2002  at  Sehlaba  Sabana
           Preschool in Soweto;


       (b)  these computers are designed to  expose  preschool  children  to
           technology and help them to develop literacy, numeracy and  life
           skills; and


       (c)  this is part of IBM's early learning programme  which  is  being
           implemented in 500 preschools worldwide, and  70  preschools  in
           South Africa have benefited from this programme;


  (2) believes that this programme will contribute positively to  enhancing
       future learners' interest in science and technology and  will  lay  a
       solid foundation for the development of human resources ...

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member,  your  motion  will  be  printed.
Thank you for the new title.

Mnu R S NTULI: Sihlalo, ngiphakamisa ukuthi ekulaleni  okulandelayo  kweNdlu
ngizophakamisa:


  Ukuthi iNdlu -


  (1) ikwamukele ukuthi -


       (a)  abantu abangama-45% baphila ngama-R20,00 ngelanga;


       (b)   ngakho-ke,  umbono  kaMongameli   wokuthi   ububha   buyancipha
           emiphakathini uyamangalisa; futhi


       (c)  isabelo semali eyisisekelo eyi-R110,00 ngenyanga ingasiza abantu
           abayizigidi eziyi-12;


     2)  sinxusa  ukuba  uHulumeni   we-ANC   ayeke   ukusebenzisa   izimali
        zomphakathi ngokunganaki,  kodwa  ulekelele  abampofu  ngokubanikeza
        sabelo semali eyisisekelo njengoba i-Democratic Alliance icela.


[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu notice of motion follows.)

[Mr R S NTULI: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day  of
the House, I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  about 45% of people are living on R20,00 per day;


       (b)  the President's view  that  poverty  is  being  reduced  amongst
           communities is therefore surprising; and


       (c)  a basic income grant of R110,00 per month can  help  12  million
           poor people; and


  (2) appeals to the ANC Government to stop  using  the  community's  money
       carelessly and to assist poor people by instituting  a  basic  income
       grant as the Democratic Alliance has requested.

[Applause.]]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 11 people caught delivering dagga worth R4  million  at  a
       vehicle compound at Airport Industria  in  Cape  Town  were  arrested
       after a shootout with police on Saturday, 9 November 2002;


  (2) further notes that the arrests were made possible as a result of  two
       alert security guards who alerted the authorities  when  they  became
       suspicious and realised something illegal was going on; and


  (3) congratulates all who played a part in the arrest of the suspects.

Mr M J G MZONDEKI: Chairperson, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism,  the
           hon Rejoice Mabudafhansi, launched two major clean-up  campaigns
           on 9 November 2002 in Stellenbosch and  Strand  in  the  Western
           Cape;


       (b)  these clean-up campaigns are part of the Government's activities
           to celebrate November as environment month; and


       (c)  these activities seek to mobilise communities to work towards  a
           cleaner and greener environment;


  (2) believes that this reflects the commitment of the ANC  Government  to
       upholding the right of all South Africans to a clean environment;


  (3) welcomes the launch of the clean-up campaign; and


  (4) urges all South Africans to emulate this shining example.

[Applause.]

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF JOINT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS AND MEMBERS' INTERESTS
        - BREACH OF CODE OF CONDUCT BY MRS N W MADIKIZELA-MANDELA, MP

Mr L T LANDERS: Mr Chairperson, having  received  a  formal  complaint,  and
having afforded the hon Madikizela-Mandela all the rights and processes  due
to her in terms of the law and the  Rules  of  this  Parliament,  the  Joint
Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests agreed to appoint  a  panel  from
amongst its members who would conduct a formal hearing into that  complaint,
because a dispute had arisen and been declared between the  hon  member  and
the Joint Committee as to the facts.

On 13 August 2002, the panel duly convened to conduct the hearing, at  which
the hon Madikizela-Mandela was not present. In terms of our  Rules  and  the
Code of Conduct, such a hearing may be  proceeded  with,  notwithstanding  a
member's absence, provided that the panel is satisfied that the  member  had
been given due notice of it.

After consideration of the evidence and facts presented  to  it,  the  panel
reached the findings and recommendations, and proposed  the  sanctions  that
are contained in the report before this House today, which were  unanimously
adopted by the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests.

Accordingly, and on behalf of the Joint Committee  on  Ethics  and  Members'
Interests, I hereby humbly beg this House to adopt this report. [Applause.]

  The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:


  That the Report be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HOME AFFAIRS - ILLEGAL
                   ZIMBABWEAN FARM LABOUR IN SOUTPANSBERG
Mr M I SCOTT: Mr Chairperson, the secretariat of the Portfolio Committee  on
Home Affairs have provided me with the following status report  for  noting.
In 2001, the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Home  Affairs  went  to  Messina  to
investigate  the  status  of  illegal  Zimbabwean   farm   labour   in   the
Soutpansberg. The committee  tabled  the  report  to  Parliament,  dated  13
November 2001.

Developments in the province overtook the recommendations of  the  committee
and the Departments  of  Labour  and  Home  Affairs,  and  the  Soutpansberg
Agricultural Union reached an agreement, which was  signed  by  these  three
role-players who made provision, firstly, that farmers  must  apply  to  the
Department of Labour to make use of Zimbabwean farm labour;  secondly,  that
the Department of Labour will in turn give the Department  of  Home  Affairs
the necessary authorisation for the  required  permits;  and  thirdly,  that
Home Affairs would then provide the permits after  receiving  the  requisite
authorisation from the Department of Labour. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:


  That the Report be noted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly noted.

  CONSIDERATION OF INTERIM REPORT OF JOINT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS AND MEMBERS'
               INTEREST - COMPLAINT AGAINST MR T S YENGENI, MP

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:


  That the Report be noted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly noted.

   CONSIDERATION OF SECOND REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS

Mr F  BEUKMAN:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  I  thank  the  House  for  this
opportunity  to  speak  on  behalf  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public
Accounts. It  is  important  that  the  reports  of  Scopa  should  get  the
necessary priority in terms of the proceedings of the House.

The Second Report of the Standing Committee on  Public  Accounts,  dated  30
May 2001, deals with the process followed  by  Scopa  in  dealing  with  the
issues raised in the well-documented 14th report for 2000  to  the  National
Assembly, relating to the strategic defence package procurement.

The report deals firstly with the progress of the  investigation;  secondly,
interaction with Ministers; and thirdly, the engagement with  correspondence
from the Leader of Government Business. It also deals  with  the  activities
of the Joint Investigating Team, the broad framework of  the  investigation,
the  investigation  of   alleged   irregularities   and   other   areas   of
investigation.

The report mainly deals with the opinion of Scopa and  the  outcome  of  the
meeting with the Joint Investigating Team on 7 February 2001. It also  deals
with  the  question  of  the  inclusion  or   exclusion   of   the   Special
Investigating Unit and the recommendation  of  Scopa  in  that  regard.  The
report also documents the outcome of  the  meeting  with  the  committee  of
Ministers, consisting of Defence, Trade and Industry and Finance.

The report also records the request of Scopa to the Portfolio  Committee  on
Trade and Industry  to  evaluate  and  report  on  the  issues  relating  to
guarantees of national industrial participation and to indicate  whether  it
is satisfied that targets will be met.

The report also deals with the question of documentation in relation to  the
period immediately prior to the committee  finalising  its  14th  report.  A
vast  amount  of  documentation  pertaining   to   the   strategic   defence
procurement was made available to the previous chairperson  and  there  were
subsequent interventions to allow all committee members to  have  access  to
these documents.

In conclusion, I want to quote from the last paragraph of the report -


  ... the committee will continue to exercise its oversight job, but should
  any further evidence pertaining to the  arms  deal  come  to  hand,  this
  evidence will be placed before the Joint Investigating Team  for  action.
  The committee will submit its final report to the National Assembly after
  the Joint Investigating Team has completed its work.

This report does not  represent  the  unanimous  opinion  of  the  committee
members. Consensus could not be reached on substantial issues raised in  the
14th report. These substantial differences are recorded in  the  minutes  of
the committee's meeting.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:


  That the Report be noted.

Motion agreed to (Inkatha Freedom Party dissenting).

Report accordingly noted.

The House adjourned at 17:18.

         2002, reports as follows:


         A.  Background and objectives


              The Committee, having visited the Departments  of  Agriculture
              and of Land Affairs and its institutions at the  beginning  of
              the year (14 to 18 January 2002), unanimously  agreed  at  its
              last meeting of the second term to undertake another visit  to
              Pretoria.


              The main objectives were:


              1.  To provide members with insight into the activities of the
                  two Departments and their institutions at national level.


              2.  To monitor and assess progress made by the Departments and
                  their bodies since the January visit. The  Committee  also
                  proposed information sessions to  engage  the  Departments
                  on specific issues.


              The delegation, under the leadership of the Chairperson, Mr  N
              H Masithela (ANC), comprised of Dr E A Schoeman (ANC), Ms B  M
              Ntuli (ANC), Ms O R Kasienyane (ANC), Ms N F Mathibela  (ANC),
              Mr L J Modisenyane (ANC), Bishop M S Mogoba (PAC), Mr Z Kotwal
              (ANC), Mr M A Maphalala (ANC), Mr P H K Ditshitelo (UCDP),  Mr
              D K Maluleke (DP), Mr G B Bhengu (IFP), Mr N  W  Mudau  (ANC),
              Adv S P Holomisa (ANC), Mr J Ramrock (Committee Secretary), Mr
              S  Makeleni  (Committee   Assistant),   Mr   A   N   Mthombeni
              (Parliamentary  Officer)  and   Ms   V   Dlaku   (Departmental
              Official).


         B.  Workshop on biotechnology


              The meeting was attended by the Minister for  Agriculture  and
              Land Affairs, Ms  Thoko  Didiza,  with  the  Director-General:
              Agriculture, Ms B Njobe, who clarified  the  position  of  the
              government with regard to biotechnology. The Minister spoke of
              policy  directions  and  challenges  ahead  in  dealing   with
              biotechnology issues in  South  Africa,  the  region  and  the
              continent. She  reminded  members  of  the  pivotal  role  the
              agriculture sector plays in the economy of the country.  South
              Africa is the only country in the region with a grain surplus.


              The Director-General provided background  on  the  Genetically
              Modified Organisms Act, 1997. There was agreement on a  common
              approach and view that biotechnology  was  necessary.  It  was
              noted  that  people  confronted  with  poverty   and   hunger,
              especially those in rural areas, do not  have  the  luxury  to
              choose between genetically modified and organic food.


              Mention  was  made  of  experiences  and  benefits  gained  by
              countries  in  Asia  during  what  was   called   the   "Green
              Revolution". At present there are talks of a second one,  this
              time worldwide.


              Officials from Departments  like  Health  and  Arts,  Culture,
              Science and Technology also made presentations. Members of the
              Portfolio Committees on Health and on Arts,  Culture,  Science
              and Technology participated in the workshop.


         C.  Policy options for Biotechnology Development in SA


              The Director  for  Genetic  Resources,  Dr  Moephuli,  made  a
              presentation on policy options for  Biotechnology  Development
              in South Africa. He spoke  about  the  challenges  facing  the
              country in dealing with biotechnology. South Africa  has  only
              15% arable land, and a large rural sector. With an  increasing
              population, the demand for food will become greater, resulting
              in reduced per capita natural resources and a  declining  fish
              population. Dr Moephuli also  addressed  members  on  National
              Imperatives, regulation of genetically modified organisms  and
              trade policy on biotechnology.


              Discussion points


              (a)  Extent   of   research   conducted   by   government   on
                  biotechnology and investments.


              (b) Ethical and moral sides of biotechnology  with  regard  to
                  food security.


              (c) Clarity on impact of Intellectual Property Rights  to  the
                  poor.


              (d) Clarity on known side effects of GMOs.


              (e) Extent of awareness to public on benefits of GMOs.


              (f) Clarity on arguments advanced by anti-GMO groupings.


              (g) Political implications for GMOs.


         1.  Food control


              An official from the Department of Health, Ms F W  Jansen  van
              Rijssen, made a  presentation  on  food  control  issues.  She
              focused on:


              *   Interaction of Department with other affected Departments


              *   Food from GMO


              *   Definitions of GMO


              *   Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act, 1972, and its
                 regulations


              *   Consultations


              *   Labelling


              *   SA's position on mandatory and voluntary labelling


              *   Context of "GMO-free" foods.


              Discussion points
              (a) Labelling  cost  distortions  and  labelling  segregation,
                  which could cause "class" divisions among consumers.


              (b) Compromise  of  food  safety  as  a  result  of  usage  of
                  analytical methods that are not reliable.


              (c) Capacity to evaluate number  of  GMOs  and  evaluation  of
                  whether some were rejected because of health reasons.


              (d) Labelling of products that undergo processing, and how  to
                  keep trace thereof until it becomes final product.


         2.  National Biotechnology Strategy for SA


              An official from the Department of Arts, Culture, Science  and
              Technology, Ms M Pyoos, gave a  perspective  on  the  National
              Biotechnology Strategy  for  South  Africa.  The  presentation
              focused, amongst others, on the background and  objectives  of
              the  strategy,  National  Development  Imperatives   and   the
              Implementation Framework. He also spoke about the Intellectual
              Property Rights Policy and what gave rise to it.


              Discussion points


              (a) Explanation of 14% not supportive of GMOs in participation
                  processes as organisations or individuals.


              (b) Structuring  of  Science  Budget  Vote  for  research  and
                  development.


              (c)  Challenges  for  capacity-building   of   young   science
                  students.


              (d) Room for strengthening research and development strategy.


              (e) SA does not generate patents, resulting in  dependency  on
                  other countries.


              Resolutions
              (a) Need to have clear approach of communicating  GMOs  issues
                  to public.


              (b) Challenge of mandatory labelling  would  require  capacity
                  and therefore  makes  voluntary  labelling  an  option  as
                  well.


              (c) Convincing arguments on benefits of GMOs are essential, as
                  no GMO crops currently available have any side effects.


              (d) GM-produced food is as safe  as  food  produced  otherwise
                  (according to the scientific presentation).


              (e) The need to distinguish GM foods and biotechnology.


              (f) Regulatory processes to prevent human cloning.


              (g) Acknowledgement of  political  and  technical  aspects  of
                  biotechnology. Passage of GMO  Act  by  Parliament  was  a
                  case  in  point  of  political   will.   Recent   Zimbabwe
                  rejection of GM-food aid  from  USA  indicates  that  more
                  research and awareness are needed.


              (h) Three South African  non-governmental  organisations  that
                  are  anti-GMO  must  be  engaged  for  clarity  on   their
                  position.


              (i) Discussions in respect of GMOs at interdepartmental  level
                  are encouraging and should continue.


              (j) Strong need for research to produce vaccine against  polio
                  in SA to limit dependency on other countries.


              In concluding the discussion, the issues of ethics  and  moral
              as well as the communication aspects were dealt with to  cover
              some of the  questions  posed  during  the  presentations.  An
              understanding was reached that the ethics and morale debate is
              a life debate and a world-wide phenomenon.


         D.  Land Bank


              The CEO of the Land Bank, Mr Fandeso, gave  the  delegation  a
              progress report. Some of the points he covered, included:


              1.   Update  on  the  Strategic   Plan   for   South   African
                  Agriculture. The Bank had 20 farms and sold  19  to  black
                  commercial farmers.


              2.  Development  book,  which  targets  loans  to  poor  rural
                  individuals.


              3.  Skills and capacity building.


              4.  Alliance and partnership. The Bank has a pilot youth  farm
                  project. An agreement has been reached with  the  National
                  Youth Commission, involving four farms.


              5.  Funding. The Bank has a Skills and Development  Fund  that
                  offers   bursaries    to    students    from    previously
                  disadvantaged  communities.  More  than  20  students  are
                  benefitting from this at present.


              6.  Equitable access  and  participation  strategy.  The  Bank
                  established "Mobile Banking" facilities  in  rural  areas,
                  thus reaching many poorly resourced communities.


              Discussion points


              (a) Extent of coverage of flood relief programme, for  example
                  in fire damaged areas.


              (b) Farms to be managed by National Youth Commission.


              (c) Proposed amendment to Land Bank Act.


              (d) Spreading of satellite operations.


              (e) Relationship between ABSA and Land Bank on  assistance  to
                  farmers.


              (f)  Down-grading   of   Bank   (concern   over   the   recent
                  Constitutional Court case).


              (g) Development of programme for mobile banking.


              (h) Land Bank programmes with Agri-Bank.


              (i) Extent of Agri-SA assistance to (10) projects for emerging
                  farmers.


              (j) How does Bank market itself?


         E.  Workshop on Agricultural International Trade


              1.  This was presided over by the deputy director  general  of
                  Agriculture, Ms Njabulo,  with  Ms  Vangile  Titi  as  co-
                  chair.


              2.  Ms Vangile Titi presented a framework  for  bilateral  and
                  multilateral engagements.


         F.  NEPAD

              NEPAD". The focus areas of the presentation were:


              *   Challenges
              *   NEPAD priorities
              *   Key processes to date
              *   Focus on agriculture
              *   Future processes.


              African Heads of State have selected agriculture, one  of  the
              high priority sectors for future investment,  in  view  of  it
              being the largest contributor to GDP and  employment  in  most
              African countries. This will require, among others,  increased
              productivity,  market  access  and  competitiveness   of   the
              agricultural sector. NEPAD will focus on six major constraints
              hindering progress in African agriculture:


              1.  The problem faced by rural population in getting access to
                  markets  and  resources   required   for   investment   in
                  agriculture relative to people living in urban areas.


              2.  Inadequate and inefficient agricultural systems.


              3.  Low purchasing power of rural people.


              4.  Climate uncertainty and lack of access to irrigation.


              5.  Weak institutional support (e.g.  research  and  extension
                  services).


              6.   Inadequate   attention   by   donors   and   multilateral
                  institutions to the agricultural sector.


              The  NEPAD  goal  is  an  agriculture-led   development   that
              eliminates hunger and eradicates poverty and food  insecurity,
              thereby opening the way for expansion of  exports  and  trade,
              putting the continent on a higher economic growth path  within
              an   overall   strategy   of   sustainable   development   and
              preservation of the natural resource base.

              maize, winter cereals and  wool),  and  the  validity  of  the
              schemes extended to July 2003. The reason  for  the  extension
              was to enable respective liquidation  committees  to  finalise
              outstanding issues related to levies and asset ownership.

              The  Committee  values   this   form   of   interaction   with
              stakeholders, because it is both necessary and productive, and
              it forms part of the Committee's oversight role. The Committee
              believes, from what was  observed,  that  the  Departments  of
              Agriculture  and  of  Land  Affairs  are  pursuing  the  right
              directions, and  that  they  should  be  commended  for  their
              achievements.


              The Committee notes in  particular  the  significant  progress
              made by the Land Claims Commission in the processing  of  land
              claims.
              The  Committee  expresses  its  sincere  appreciation  to  the
              Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs, Thoko  Didiza,  the
              Deputy  Minister,  Adv  D  du  Toit,   the   Director-General:
              Agriculture, Ms B Njobe, the Director-General:  Land  Affairs,
              Dr P Mayende,  heads  of  the  institutions  visited  and  the
              various officials, for the support and hospitality accorded to
              the delegation and for contributing  to  the  success  of  the
              visit.
