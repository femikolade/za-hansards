                              NOTICES OF MOTION

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, please take your seats.

Mrs J CHALMERS: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with sadness the untimely death of Comrades  Ben  Baartman  and
       Wilfred Rhodes;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  Comrade Ben Baartman was a former combatant of uMkhonto weSizwe,
           an ANC stalwart and a communist to the end; and


       (b)   Comrade  Wilfred  Rhodes  was  a  pioneer  in   building   mass
           organisations in our communities in the  Western  Cape  and  was
           instrumental in building the Cape Housing Action Committee; and


  (3) also notes that the African National  Congress  dips  its  banner  in
       honour of these selfless comrades who have dedicated all their  lives
       to the freedom of the people of South Africa.

Lala kahle [Rest in peace], Comrade Baartman. Lala kahle, Comrade Wilfie!

[Applause.]
Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker, I give notice on behalf of the DP that I  shall
move:


  That the House -


  (1) deplores the chilling manner in which the Deputy Minister of  Foreign
       Affairs  described  critics  of  Government  policy  on  Zimbabwe  as
       ``subversive'';


  (2) notes that the ANC  is  adopting  the  same  dismal  tactics  as  the
       apartheid  National  Party  government  in   labelling   critics   as
       subversive enemies;


  (3) further notes that because of Zanu-PF's  land  grab  policy  and  the
       South African Government's failure to act, the rand has today sunk to
       R10,81 to the US dollar; and


  (4) finds the Government's paralysis inexcusable  in  the  light  of  the
       human tragedy unfolding in Zimbabwe and the damaging consequences for
       the South African economy.
[Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf
of the IFP at the next sitting:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns the events around the Inanda Seminary,  an  exclusive  girls
       institution of higher learning in KwaZulu-Natal, which is under siege
       as the police and the squatting community  wage  a  battle  on  their
       doorstep;


  (2) reminds the surrounding community of the  importance  of  the  school
       because of leaders produced there, that it is the home of the  Shembe
       church and that it is the resting place of one of  the  forebears  of
       the struggle, Dr J L Dube; and


  (3) calls on the leadership in the area to ensure the protection of those
       young girls in their dormitories,  the  reverence  of  the  place  of
       worship and the peaceful rest of the heroes of the struggle.

[Applause.]

Mr M J G MZONDEKI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of  Labour,  the  hon  Membathisi  Mdladlana,
       introduced a code of good  practice  on  19  August,  which  requires
       companies to employ a minimum number of workers with disabilities;


  (2) further notes that this code of good practice will serve as  a  guide
       for employers and employees in promoting equal opportunities and fair
       treatment for people with disabilities;


  (3) believes that this demonstrates the ANC-led  Government's  commitment
       to policies aimed at -


       (a)  reversing all forms of discrimination; and


       (b)  empowering all marginalised sections of our population;


  (4) notes that the ANC commends the Minister of Labour for  embarking  on
       this important policy initiative; and


  (5) calls on all companies and individuals to heed the new regulations.

[Applause.]

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I  shall  move  on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the Premier of  the  Western  Cape,  Mr  Marthinus  van
       Schalkwyk, and his new cabinet on their first 60 days in  office  and
       more specifically on returning stability and good governance  to  the
       province;


  (2) notes with appreciation his vision to build  a  world-class  province
       that cares and breaks new ground in  bringing  different  communities
       together to build a common future - as evidenced by  new  initiatives
       like the Partnerships for Progress project, which links schools  from
       different communities;


  (3) applauds his prioritisation of front-line  delivery  in  the  Western
       Cape through, inter alia, additional  emergency  vehicles,  new  Aids
       pilot projects and an intensified roll-out of nevirapine,  innovative
       tourism initiatives to create jobs and a renewed focus  on  education
       as the key to escaping poverty; and


  (4) urges the premier and the New NP-ANC coalition government to continue
       with their efforts to improve the lives of all the people.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the UDM at  the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns the suppression of freedom of thought and speech, since this
       strikes at the very heart of our constitutional democracy;


  (2) confirms that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, and that the
       survival of democracy depends on people taking a stand  and  speaking
       up, especially when freedom of thought and speech are under threat;


  (3) expresses its unreserved dismay  that  the  centralist  and  isolated
       leadership of the ANC has forced Jeremy Cronin, SACP MP, to apologise
       for voicing concerns which are  shared by many, about the current ANC
       leadership's increasing distance from the needs  and  aspirations  of
       the majority of  South  Africans,  under  the  guise  of  adopting  a
       principled stand; and


  (4) is alarmed at the  ever-growing  list  of  people,  including  Nelson
       Mandela and Desmond Tutu on the topic  of  HIV/Aids,  who  have  been
       berated and vilified by ANC leaders for speaking the truth.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a white woman entrepreneur and ANC activist, Ms Wanda Stoffberg,
           was physically and verbally abused by a group  of  white  right-
           wingers for serving black customers in her  butchery  in  George
           last year; and


       (b)  those involved in this criminal act have not been apprehended by
           the police;


  (2)  further  notes  that  the  DA-controlled  George  municipality   has
       instructed her to close down her butchery;


  (3) believes that -


       (a)  the actions of the DA-controlled municipality of  George  served
           to fuel racial tensions and  divisions  amongst  the  people  of
           George; and


       (b)  in so doing undermined the efforts of our  Government  to  build
           one nation; and


  (4) notes that the ANC calls on -


       (a)  the police to expedite the investigation of this case; and


       (b)  the DA ...

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I will  move  on  behalf  of
the ACDP at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that certain home owners are cashing in on the demand for  World
           Summit accommodation by letting out their houses  at  exorbitant
           prices - some for up to R30Â 000 a day; and


       (b)  that these actions have been criticised  by  the  South  African
           Tourism chief, Cheryl Carolus, and the South African Chamber  of
           Business for being ``short-sighted''  and  ``severely  denting''
           the country's ``image'' overseas; and


  (2) calls upon all South Africans to be responsible  and  not  overcharge
       visiting delegates, as we are faced with an unprecedented opportunity
       to market South Africa as one of the  cheapest  and  best  value-for-
       money destinations worldwide, and, in so doing, to encourage visiting
       delegates to return to South Africa in the future as tourists.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall on behalf of  the
UCDP move:


  That the House -


     (1)    notes with great concern that -


          (a)     prisons that have been placed under scrutiny by  the  Jali
               Commission so far  have  revealed  that  a  good  number  of
               officials, some in high  offices,  are  a  disgrace  to  the
               nation;


          (b)     internal disciplinary hearings they hold are a farce; and


          (c)     recommendations for appointment teem with  corruption  and
               nepotism while certificates obtained  fraudulently  are  the
               order of the day;


  (2) further notes that we pray for the strength of  the  members  of  the
       commission to delve deeper into the rot; and


  (3) calls on the Minister of Correctional Services to come  down  heavily
       on the officers concerned to ensure that our prison system is rid  of
       these clots in the circulation system of our Public Service.

[Applause.]

Ms P N MNANDI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the ANC Women's League in the Western Cape organised a rally  of
           local  women  and  woman  refugees  from  the  DRC,  Angola  and
           Mozambique on Sunday, 18 August, at Du Noon, Milnerton; and


       (b)  this rally  highlighted  human  rights  abuses  of  refugees  in
           general and woman refugees in particular in our communities;


  (2) believes that the abuse of the rights of refugees is a  manifestation
       of an endemic problem of racism, xenophobia and related  intolerances
       in our communities;


  (3) further believes that this rally represents a  conscious  attempt  to
       build solidarity among the African people to fight xenophobia;


  (4) further notes that the ANC commends the ANC  Women's  League  in  the
       Western Cape.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that -


       (a)  the ANC-run Johannesburg Metro is unable to conduct an efficient
           billing system for municipal services;


       (b)  despite having been in power in Johannesburg  for  a  number  of
           years, the ANC has still  not  managed  to  introduce  processes
           which will prevent the current chaos; and


       (c)  many residents receive incorrect accounts totalling hundreds  of
           thousands of rands, others receive no accounts at all, and still
           others receive accounts for properties  which  they  sold  years
           ago;


  (2) therefore calls on the ANC to take urgent steps to  ensure  that  the
       finances of South Africa's largest city are restored to good health.

[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that business leaders in various sectors of  the  economy  have
       joined forces with the SA Revenue Service (Sars) to help root out tax
       evaders and fraudsters;


  (2) expresses its appreciation to the private sector for  the  assistance
       they are providing in rooting out tax  evasion  and  fraud  in  South
       Africa; and


  (3) urges all businesses and other institutions,  not  already  assisting
       Sars, to get involved and lend their support and assistance.

Mr W M SKHOSANA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House notes -


  (1) that financial institutions have not made the R11,3 billion available
       to fund low-cost housing as pledged in the job summit;


  (2) also notes reports that banks claim that low-cost  housing  has  cost
       them R1 billion in debts;
  (3) believes that -


       (a)  the reconstruction  and  development  of  our  country  requires
           productive partnership between our people,  the  Government  and
           the business sector; and


       (b)  the financial institutions have an obligations to contribute  to
           efforts aimed at alleviating poverty and building one nation;


  (4) calls on financial institutions, including banks, to  make  resources
       available for building houses for the poor; and


  (5) further calls on all those who have been granted loans  by  banks  to
       repay them, thus making these institutions sustainable.

[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the New NP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes with amusement the confusion amongst DA councillors with regard
       to the DA's ``fight back'' slogan, which appears  to  have  become  a
       ``fight all'' slogan, in light of the following incident:


       During a special council meeting the leader of the DA in Mogale city,
       Krugersdorp, grabbed the microphone out of a fellow DA member's  hand
       and ordered him to shut up and sit down; and


  (2) believes that the DA leadership should  call  a  special  meeting  to
       clarify councillors' misinterpretation of  the  DA's  ``fight  back''
       slogan, and to remind them that it does not  mean  that  they  should
       fight each other.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

                   WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  South Africa  will  host  more  than  100  heads  of  state  and
           government,  approximately  60  000  delegates   and   a   large
           contingent of international media representatives attending  the
           World Summit on Sustainable Development;


         (b)     the theme of the Summit is "People, Planet and  Prosperity"
              and will be officially opened on 26 August 2002; and


         (c)     President Thabo Mbeki opened a  Summit  Art  Exhibition  at
              Ubuntu Village on Tuesday, 20 August 2002;
     (2)    believes that this important Summit will assume as  its  primary
         responsibility the intensification of the struggle  to  secure  the
         social and economic upliftment  of  all  people,  and  seeking  the
         realisation of this goal in a manner that  protects  and  preserves
         our global environment;


     (3)    welcomes all WSSD delegates who have descended on  South  Africa
         to attend this Summit; and


     (4)    wishes them every  success  in  the  deliberations  during  this
         historic Summit.

Agreed to.

             BANKING SECTOR COMMITMENT TO HELP POOR WITH HOUSING

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -
  (1) notes the banking sector's commitment to help provide  housing  funds
       for the poor and to ensure life cover on mortgage bonds  for  people,
       regardless of their HIV status; and


  (2) welcomes this decision by the banking sector because it will  improve
       the lives of many people.

Agreed to.

 CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FROM MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM
  FOR EXCLUSION OF TWO PORTIONS OF LAND FROM KALAHARI GEMSBOK NATIONAL PARK
                    IN TERMS OF NATIONAL PARKS ACT, 1976

The SPEAKER: Order! The report of the portfolio committee,  printed  in  the
ATC of 20 August, requires a technical correction. The portion of  the  land
referred to in paragraph (a) should read ``San'', and  the  portion  of  the
land referred to in paragraph (b) should read ``Mier''  and  not  the  other
way around. The corrected version of the report, which  we  are  asking  hon
members to approve, is on members'  desks.  The  ATC  will,  of  course,  be
reprinted with the corrected version of the report.

There was no debate.

Exclusion of two portions of land from Kalahari Gemsbok  National  Park,  as
recommended by the portfolio committee, approved. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, this is a historic occasion and it is  appropriate
that we take this decision just  before  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development.

In terms of the agreement, the park and  the  Minister  of  Agriculture  and
Land Affairs will transfer approximately 28Â 000  hectares  of  land  in  the
park to the  San  community.  [Applause.]  This  land  is  adjacent  to  the
southern boundary of the park. It is referred to as the  San  Heritage  Land
and the San community will be the owner.

Further under  the  agreement,  the  Minister  will  transfer  approximately
30Â 000 hectares of land in the park to the  Mier  community.  This  land  is
adjacent also to the southern boundary of the park. It  is  referred  to  as
the Mier Heritage Land, and the Mier community will the owner of this  land.
[Applause.] Both areas will be jointly referred to as the Heritage Land.

Earlier today I received the full documentation on  the  transfer  of  these
lands. It is sent to the Parliament of South Africa, in  appreciation,  from
the two communities and I will depositing it in the library. I also  commend
it to all hon members. [Applause.]

                                DEFENCE BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF  DEFENCE:  Madam  Speaker,  it  has  taken  eight  years  of
consistent work to bring the Defence Bill to this  point,  its  tabling,  in
the National Assembly. Every year since 1995 the Ministry has forwarded  the
Bill to the programming committee in  Parliament,  but  because  every  year
since 1995 the Bill was nearing completion, it has been held up.

The problems during the course of these  eight  years  have  centred  around
achieving a balance between what this Government wants to say  ideologically
about defence in a  democracy  and  the  feasibility  of  implementing  that
policy. The Defence Act provides  the  framework  within  which  a  military
force operates, deploys its troops,  is  funded  and  interacts  with  civil
society and other states.

However, the nature of military missions  and  what  determines  them  often
changes more dramatically than the legislation itself.  The  challenge  then
becomes ensuring that the Act, whilst designed primarily around a  defensive
posture and based on peace and security  perspectives,  does  not  become  a
straitjacket for actions related, for example, to  the  various  deployments
in peace establishment, peace enforcement and support.

The Defence Act will operate alongside a battery  of  other  defence-related
legislation, like the Armscor Act, the  Defence  Special  Account  Act,  the
Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance  Act,  the  National  Conventional
Arms Control Act and the Public Finance Management Act, to name but a few.

Thus, for example, with the ratification of  the  PFMA  and  new  rules  for
accounting officers, the chapter in the Bill on the responsibilities of  the
Secretary for Defence had to be readjusted and aligned  with  the  new  Act,
itself a long process. It also had to be  agreed  to  by  the  parliamentary
defence committees, then go back again to the state law advisers  and  last,
but not least, the chapter in question had to be retranslated.

The length of time it has taken to draw up this Bill reflects  the  enormity
of the task of defence and the complexity of the process  of  law.  The  old
Defence Act, written in 1957, reflected the strategic  position  of  defence
at the height of the apartheid regime.  Whilst  some  aspects  of  that  Act
could be retained with the advent of  democracy,  the  defence  posture  had
been transformed from offensive to defensive. The practical implications  of
the defence posture find expression in this Bill.

The issue of a new Act  was  raised  formally  in  1989  at  the  unofficial
meeting in Lusaka between the  old  SA  Defence  Force  and  MK  -  uMkhonto
weSizwe  -  and  then  followed  through  the  inter-related  constitutional
discussions before the Transitional Executive Council, prior to 1994.

Negotiations around defence and the changing defence policy, as  articulated
in the White Paper on Defence, were instrumental in the decision to draw  up
a new Bill and not to further amend the 1957 Act. However, there  were  some
changes that could not  wait  for  the  rewriting  of  the  Bill.  The  most
important of all the changes introduced in 1994 was that of civil  oversight
and the creation of a Defence Secretariat.

The first amendment to the 1957 Act accommodated  the  Defence  Secretariat,
and the second amendment placed  the  Defence  Secretary  as  not  just  the
accounting officer but also as  the  head  of  the  department.  Again,  the
Department of Defence had to align itself  with  the  legislation  from  the
Public Service. The status of uniformed members of the SA  National  Defence
Force  had  subsequently  also  to  be  aligned  with  the  Public   Service
legislation.

Some problem areas remain and are still under debate. They include  military
unions, military versus constitutional justice and clear lines of  authority
and power. These are still in the process of transformation and growth.

I have tried to give hon members a taste of the complexities of  drawing  up
this  legislation.  The  Bill  itself  delineates  the  components  of   the
Department  of  Defence  and  sets  out  their   functions.   The   civilian
secretariat for defence enshrined in our Constitution is established, as  is
the composition of the  SA  National  Defence  Force,  the  Defence  Force's
structure and functions re the four services, its head, the Chief of the  SA
National Defence Force, and his or her functions. How and when  the  Defence
Force can and will be employed is described in chapter 3.

Chapter 4 deals with law enforcement powers of the Defence Force at sea  and
is in line with  the  international  laws  governing  maritime  affairs  and
procedures. Chapters 5 and  6  deal,  in  turn,  with  the  appointment  and
functions of military police and the Defence Intelligence division.

Chapter 7 deals with what I have previously  referred  to  as  a  myriad  of
structures, the hierarchy through which  decision-making  is  taken  in  the
department. Provision is also made for a reserve force council. I  highlight
that because hon members have expressed concern, in  recent  months,  as  to
the state of the reserve force. This provision  ensures  that  attention  is
given to the reserve force.

Chapters 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 centre  primarily  around  individual  members
and how they function within the institution of Defence.  Chapter  14  deals
with conditions around a state of national defence.  Chapter  15  is  to  do
with co-operation with  other  forces  and  forces  visiting  South  Africa.
Chapter 16 deals with boards of inquiry, and chapter 17  with  offences  and
penalties.

The  Bill  has  been  discussed  by  defence  committees  since   1994.   An
interesting reflection on the development of our democracy  is  to  look  at
who sat on the past defence committees and  where  they  are  now.  The  hon
Lindiwe Sisulu and Nosiviwe  Mapisa-Nqakula  are  now  Minister  and  Deputy
Minister respectively; Rapu Molekane is one  of  our  ambassadors  overseas;
Thabang Makwetla is now a provincial MEC in the province of Mpumalanga;  and
hon members Mpho Scott, James Ngculu, Ntshiki  Mashimbye  and  Zo  Kota  are
chairpersons of parliamentary committees.

Dr Ian Phillips is the adviser to the Minister for  Public  Enterprises  and
Mr Linda Mti and Jenny Shreiner are Director-General  and  Deputy  Director-
General respectively of Correctional Services.  Mr  Velaphi  Ndlovu  made  a
valuable contribution and has now moved back to KwaZulu-Natal. Gen  Constand
Viljoen and Pieter Breytenbach are  both  now  in  retirement.  Hon  members
Gerhard Koornhof, Douglas Gibson, James  Selfe  and  Petrus  Groenewald  are
still in the House but, sadly, no longer with the committee.

Many decision-makers today are familiar with this Bill and have  contributed
to its completion. I must extend thanks, yet again, to the Defence Act  work
group, set up by my predecessor, the late Minister Modise  in  1995.  Messrs
Laurie Nathan, Dave Scrooby, Fink Haysom, Johan Potgieter  and  Ms  Caroline
Dreyer must all be recognised for their contribution.

My thanks extend to our previous Defence Secretaries, Mr  Pierre  Steyn  and
Mr Mamatho Netsianda, as well as Mr Aboobaker  Ismail,  not  forgetting  our
two previous Ministers,  Joe  Modise  and  his  deputy  at  that  time,  now
Minister Ronnie  Kasrils,  and,  of  course,  to  all  the  members  of  the
Department of Defence who stuck with this Bill through thick and thin.

Because this Bill embraces such a  huge  area  and  deals  with  the  living
reality, there will always be changes  and  amendments  to  be  made.  These
should  be  made  in  a  manner  that  provides  stability  in  the  defence
environment without rigidity. May I also  say  to  the  chairperson  of  the
committee, Ms Thandi Modise, that its  completion  is  a  great  achievement
which was led by herself. [Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, ...
... batswana ba re se ileng se a bo se ile, lesilo  ke  moselatedi.  [It  is
useless crying over spilt milk.]

After 46  amendments,  portions  thereof  being  declared  unconstitutional,
after the dawn of democracy in this country, the Defence Act  of  1957  must
go. It has served its purposes; it is outdated.

The Defence Bill of 2001 before us today lays down the statutory  basis  for
the  implementation  of  the  new  and  progressive  policies.   This   Bill
incorporates national, regional and  international  policies.  It  moves  us
towards our own understanding of national security, as  defined  in  section
198 of the Constitution of South Africa, which says


  National  security  must  reflect  the  resolve  of  South  Africans,  as
  individuals and as a nation, to live as equals,  to  live  in  peace  and
  harmony, to be free from fear and to seek a better life.

The Constitution states clearly that national security  is  subject  to  the
authority of Parliament  and  the  national  executive,  and  that  national
security must be pursued in compliance with laws.

Clause 2 of the Defence Bill reflects on these  provisions  and  the  ideals
stated in the White  Paper  on  Defence.  It  sets  out  very  strongly  the
authority and the responsibility for policy formulation and execution.  This
clause also outlaws party-partisan behaviour and prejudice, and  shifts  the
SANDF  radically.  It  says  that  the  Defence  Force  must   respect   the
fundamental rights and dignity of its members, and of all persons.

Read together with Clause 105,  which  outlaws  offensive  behaviour,  these
clauses begin to protect not only the individual members, usually  those  in
the lower ranks, but also those of different colours and  races  within  the
Defence Force. This clause protects people who usually  find  themselves  in
fear of, offended or oppressed by members of the Defence Force.

Clause 105 does not confine itself to verbal and physical  abuse  only,  but
goes further, and I quote:


  ... humiliates or shows hostility or aversion to any other person on  the
  grounds of that person's race, gender, sex,  pregnancy,  marital  status,
  ethnic or social origin, colour,  sexual  orientation,  age,  disability,
  religion, conscience, belief, culture, language or birth ...

It was deliberately phrased widely to protect both members  of  the  Defence
Force and people outside of it. This means that  anybody  who  commits  such
behaviour is guilty of an offence.  This  also  means  that  people  can  no
longer be subjected to this within the confines of the Defence Force.

Chapter 3 of this Bill is especially  important  to  the  ANC.  It  makes  a
distinction between things military, which are  the  responsibility  of  the
Chief of the Defence Force, and things administrative and  political,  which
are the preserve of the Minister and the Secretary for Defence.
In its deliberations on this chapter, members  of  the  portfolio  committee
reiterated  their  belief  in  civilian  authority.  They  agreed  that  the
Secretary for Defence is the head of Department  and  the  chief  accounting
officer. How the Secretary for Defence delegates his or  her  powers  was  a
subject for a very  lively  debate,  and  the  committee  then  drafted  the
amendment to be what is now reflected by clause 9.

During the public  hearings  it  became  very  clear  that  South  Africans,
together with the members of the committee,  agreed  that  the  position  of
Secretary for Defence must be occupied by a civilian.  Emphasis  was  placed
on not having military officers who could jump out of military clothes  into
civilian clothes and occupy  this  position.  What  was  referred  to  as  a
``greening'' period was discussed.

The Bill in Clause 18(2) provides that the President or  the  Minister  must
inform Parliament promptly and in appropriate detail of the reasons for  the
deployment of the  SA  National  Defence,  of  the  place,  of  the  numbers
involved, of the period involved, and of how much it is going to  cost  this
country. Clause 18(3) provides that if Parliament does not  sit  during  the
first seven days  after  the  deployment,  the  President  or  the  Minister
``must'' provide  the  information  required  to  an  appropriate  oversight
parliamentary committee.

The President employs the Defence Force in fulfilment  of  an  international
obligation, to go to war, or in a state  in  which  this  country  is  under
attack. He might also deploy the Defence Force in support of the police.  If
he or she does this, he must report to this House.

The Bill also takes into consideration that it is not  always  possible  for
the Minister or for the President to deploy the Defence Force. It  therefore
empowers the Secretary for Defence, in concurrence with  the  Chief  of  the
Defence Force, to do so, and  for  this  decision  to  be  ratified  by  the
Minister. The Minister is still required to report back to  Parliament,  and
Parliament then exercises its power in terms  of  whether  it  agrees  with,
rejects, changes, or substitutes  the  authorisation  given  by  either  the
Minister or the President on the  deployment  of  the  SA  National  Defence
Force.

This  provision  is  important  because  it  entrenches  the  authority   of
Parliament, as a representative of the people,  to  hold  the  executive  to
account. It also means that all employment will be  clearly  considered  and
calculated. Nobody would want to be embarrassed by Parliament rejecting  the
authorisation or altering such  authorisation.  It  also  means  that  South
Africa can never go to war, at least not for more than seven  days,  without
Parliament expressing itself one way or the other.

It also means that Parliament, and not just the President, the  Minister  or
the Chief of the Defence Force, takes  the  responsibility  for  deployment,
for costs, for injuries and for the body bags that  would  be  involved.  It
also means that this House has serious powers of war.

The portfolio committee held public hearings on the  employment  of  the  SA
National  Defence  Force  in  support  of  the  SA   Police   Service.   The
Constitution, in terms of clause 201(2), provides for this deployment.  This
Bill elaborates on this provision and states that this  deployment  must  be
gazetted within 24 hours. The public hearings revealed that  South  Africans
were against this. We did not want to see the continued  deployment  of  the
security forces, and we did not want to carry  the  burden  of  the  Defence
Force being unleashed on the civilian population. However, we are also  very
realistic that it will happen.

We therefore continued to deliberate on this, and crafted the police  powers
to be given to members of the Defence Force, as  is  now  reflected  in  the
Bill.

Clause 20 was a product of soul-searching, heated  debate  and  negotiation.
It recognises that the Defence Force will be  deployed  and  must  be  given
those powers  under  the  supervision  of  the  police,  and  that  in  this
deployment they must be protected.

Clause 20 also recognises that the Defence Force must be  suitably  equipped
and empowered when they do border control duty. They must have the power  to
apprehend, question or, subject to the provisions of the Criminal  Procedure
Act, be able to arrest and detain without a warrant anybody  who  is  caught
doing anything illegal. They must also be able to arrest anybody  without  a
warrant who is seen as an illegal foreigner, and who will then be  subjected
to the provisions of the Act on illegal immigrants. This clause  means  that
when one deploys, one must equip and one must train and train.

Clause 50 of the Bill deals with the limitations of rights  for  members  of
the Defence Force and its employees. It allows for members and employees  to
be  subjected  to  searches,  to  inspections,   to   screening   of   their
communications, to  security  clearances  and  to  shared  accommodation  or
privation according to the exigencies of military training and operations.

This clause restricts the right to demonstrate, to picket, to  petition  and
to assemble. It limits access to sensitive places  and  installations.  This
clause also states that movement may be limited or  confined,  as  the  case
may be, and that all  full-time  serving  members  may  be  moved  from  one
geographic spot to another.

As a result of conscription in this  country,  hundreds  of  South  Africans
stayed longer at university, some South Africans went into exile, some  went
to prison and others were seriously harmed.  As  a  nation  we  agreed  that
South Africa would only have one Defence Force, and that that Defence  Force
would be an all-volunteer force.

Clause 89 of this Bill empowers the President, by proclamation,  to  declare
a state  of  national  defence,  as  contemplated  in  section  209  of  the
Constitution, if the country is threatened  by  war.  Clause  90  gives  the
President the power to mobilise the citizens for service if the  country  is
under attack. This provision also makes sure that people below  the  age  of
18  cannot  be  mobilised.  It  also  makes  provision  for  exemptions  and
deferment of people. In other  words,  there  is  no  way  South  Africa  is
thinking of bringing back conscription.

We must, however, look at what other countries are doing. For  instance,  if
we look at Nigeria's national service programme,  it  allows  the  youth  to
spend time doing community work, to gain experience and to serve.  It  helps
the youth to get out of crime, to  begin  to  contribute  and  to  begin  to
identify the careers they might want to have in later life.

The Bill recognises the ``one force'' concept  -  the  SA  National  Defence
Force as a regular force and as a reserve force. Clause 53(2)  outlines  the
conditions of training, the  enrolment  procedures,  transfers,  promotions,
etc. This actually means that we cannot - we dare not - not change  the  way
we are budgeting currently, because if we do not do so, we will continue  to
have a reserve force which, whether we like it or not, is not  ready  to  be
deployed. This will, in fact, weaken  our  strength  in  a  way  that  other
countries are strengthened by having reserve forces.

I want to take this opportunity to thank state law  advisers  Mr  Hoorn,  Mr
Hercules and Ms Bulisile for the great amount of  help  they  gave  to  this
committee. I also want to thank Dr Laurie Nathan  for  always  being  there,
members  of  the  Department  of  Defence,  and  members  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Defence. I extend my appreciation to them all. [Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Madam Speaker, this Bill repeals the outdated  Defence  Act
of 1957. It is long overdue  and,  in  certain  respects,  the  old  Act  is
arguably in contradiction to the Constitution  of  1996.  It  aims  to  give
effect to the Constitution,  which  states  that  security  forces  must  be
structured and regulated by national  legislation.  Furthermore,  this  Bill
gives effect to the Constitution in that a civilian secretariat for  defence
must be established in terms whereof accountability  is  vested  not  within
the SANDF, but within the secretariat.

Furthermore, the Bill gives effect to  the  "one  force"  concept  in  terms
whereof the SANDF comprises both the regular as well as  the  reserve  force
components. However, in practice it has been proven that  this  "one  force"
concept is a totally misguided concept. The reserve force is nonexistent  at
present, with the exclusion of the leadership. It receives a meagre  sum  of
approximately  R3  000  per  unit  per  month  in  order   to   ensure   its
survivability. This state of affairs is, in fact, killing  off  the  reserve
force component under the pretext of a lack of funding. We in  the  DA  have
expressed our concerns time and time again in  this  respect.  Excuses  have
been made, not only by the Department, but in particular by the Minister  of
Defence.

With regard to the regular component of the "one force" concept in terms  of
the Bill, which, by its very nature, cannot address  the  following  issues,
is a Defence Force in which financial priorities are  skewed.  Approximately
50% of troops are not fit for duty owing to old age and/or illness of  which
HIV/Aids seems  to  be  a  major  contributor.  There  is  also  a  lack  of
equipment. Buildings are in critical need of repair and buildings  in  which
people have to train and buildings  used  for  storing  important  equipment
need attention.
The question is: How can this Bill assist in  resolving  these  issues?  The
answer is quite clear: only to a  limited  extent.  Political  will  by  the
Minister is required, not - as allegedly reported in the media this  morning
- spying on labour unions. It is strange to note that Parliament is  dealing
with this Bill, the cornerstone of the Department  of  Defence,  whilst  the
updated Defence Review is still not forthcoming.  The  Defence  Bill  should
follow policy - the updated Defence Review - and not the  other  way  round.
However, what is most concerning is  the  lack  of  political  will  by  the
Minister of Defence to address some of these issues.

There has been  acceptance  of  this  atrocious  state  of  affairs  without
displaying any initiative. We  currently  have  a  Defence  Force  which  is
totally oversized. Neither the provisions of this  Bill  nor  the  political
will has been demonstrated in terms of how these  issues  are  to  be  dealt
with.

This department has been turned into a social welfare department and, may  I
venture to say, an armed social welfare  department.  This,  instead  of  an
effective and disciplined military force.  We  have  troops,  albeit  sickly
troops, lying  in  units  without  money  to  transport  these  members  for
exercises. We have  a  force  with  too  many  generals.  Whether  they  are
employed outside the four arms of service or not is irrelevant. We have  had
newspaper reports of generals waiting at home to be  retired,  and  generals
who are absent from the force owing to  ill  health,  age  or  incompetence.
What is the Minister doing about this?

No Defence Bill can address all these issues. Only firm  political  will  by
the Ministry of Defence, which has been sorely  lacking,  can  do  this.  We
have enough excuses, explanations and theories. We have had enough plans  of
action and documents. When can we expect to see  results  in  terms  of  all
these abovementioned issues?

The problems in this department have to a certain  extent  been  created  by
the Defence budget allocation of 41% to the Strategic  Defence  packages  at
the expense of other capital, operating and personnel expenditures.

Despite the abovementioned facts, we have a Bill with which we  agree.  This
Bill is an attempt to provide the most  fundamental  basis  for  the  future
creation of an effective and efficient National  Defence  Force.  Membership
of the SANDF will be voluntary. However, persons employed in the SANDF  will
be obliged to remain in service during time of  war,  a  state  of  national
defence or a state of emergency. We agree with that. These  provisions  are,
equally, to be found  in  most  other  civilised  countries.  No  compulsory
service in terms of conscription is therefore envisaged  in  terms  of  this
Bill. The DA supports this notion.

It is furthermore important to point out that the  Bill  also  provides  for
the employment of the SANDF in co-operation with the  SAPS  on  a  temporary
basis  only.  We  also  support  this.  We  are  opposed  to  the  permanent
employment or deployment of the SANDF  with  the  Police  Service  in  civil
society, as this  could  potentially  lead  to  the  militarisation  of  our
community.

Although the Bill provides  for  a  sound  basis  on  which  the  SANDF  can
develop, the most crucial factor lies in the will  to  exercise  and  fulfil
the provisions of this Bill. We have seen many Bills being  passed  by  this
Parliament with very few effectively implemented. This Bill  should  note  a
new beginning and not only be a continuation  of  the  disastrous  state  of
affairs. The good intentions of this Bill will be lost should  the  Minister
of Defence continue to manage this department as he has done  in  the  past.
[Applause.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Madam  Speaker,  hon  Ministers  present  and  colleagues,
South Africa's 1993 interim Constitution established what is  now  known  as
the SA National Defence Force as the only Defence  Force  of  this  country,
and that is important. Lest we  forget  that  the  Defence  Act  during  the
apartheid era regulated the different South African races and that they  had
to belong to separate armies with separate names and with  separate  duties.
This Bill rectifies just that dilemma.  What  a  crazy  world  we  lived  in
during those days. This is but one of  the  discrepancies  which  this  Bill
rectifies.

It is unfortunate that the present SA National Defence  Force  was  governed
by  the  old  Defence  Act  of  1957  even  after  the  1996  South  African
Constitution  came  into  being.  This  is  indeed  unfortunate.   Our   new
Constitution, in section 199, provides that the  country's  security  forces
have to be dealt with and regulated by national legislation. Section 204  of
our Constitution further provides that a civilian  secretariat  for  defence
must  be  established  by  national  legislation.   Therefore,   this   Bill
represents the national legislation as required by our Constitution.

But what is important and should be welcomed by all of us is that this  Bill
repeals the old apartheid  Defence  Act,  which  divided  our  armed  forces
accordingly. The main objective of this Bill is, of course, to regulate  the
defence of our country  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  the  1996
Constitution.

It must be pointed out, however, that the provisions of the old Defence  Act
dealing with military discipline are not being repealed by  this  Bill.  The
IFP wishes to make an earnest appeal to the hon Minister to attend  to  this
matter urgently and with no delay at all.

Other important objectives this Bill includes are  that  the  Department  of
Defence consist of the Defence Secretariat,  the  SANDF  and  the  auxiliary
forces. The Bill will allow for full-time regular forces as  well  as  part-
time reserve forces. It recognises the Secretary for Defence  to  head  this
department and to act as an accounting officer, as required  by  the  Public
Finance Management Act. The main feature of  this  Bill  is  that  it  gives
effect to the decision contained in the 1998 White Paper on Defence in  that
membership of the SANDF will be voluntary.

In moving away from the old apartheid order to  the  new  democratic  order,
this Bill is very explicit in that no member of the SANDF  may  prejudice  a
political party nor further the interest of any political party. This is  an
important part of this Bill.

For those  in  Defence  who  are  contemplating  a  coup  to  overthrow  the
Government by illegal means, this Bill is very clear in that  no  member  of
the SANDF is obliged to obey a manifestly illegal order  to  carry  out  any
illegal activity. So there one has it with the coup generals.

The IFP admits that this Bill does not  go  far  enough  in  regulating  the
imbalances of the past in our Defence Force - that we must admit - but  this
is a start which is irreversible. It must carry on and  do  so  quickly.  We
must continue to transform our national Defence Force so that it  can  be  a
happy and proud family of all those who serve our country.

The IFP supports this Bill. [Applause.]
Mr D M DLALI: Madam Speaker,  today  marks  a  very  important  day  in  the
defence industry as we are about to vote for the long-awaited Defence  Bill,
which  will  completely  change  the  manner  in  which  Defence  has   been
operating.

Let me deal with the following matters in this Bill  before  us  today.  The
Government has adopted a broad holistic approach  to  security,  recognising
the various nonmilitary dimensions of security and the  distinction  between
the security of the state and the  security  of  the  people.  The  greatest
threats to the security of South African people are  socioeconomic  problems
like poverty and unemployment.

This Bill then seeks to address the intention of making sure that  there  is
clear co-operation and distinction between  the  role  of  the  SA  National
Defence Force and the SA  Police  Service  in  their  deployment  in  crime-
related matters, like cross-border control, stock theft and others.

The Government has adopted a narrow conventional approach  to  defence.  The
primary function of the SANDF is defence against  external  aggression.  The
other  function  is   secondary:   Where   self-defence   capabilities   are
insufficient  for  certain  secondary  functions   such   as   peace-support
operations  and  internal  deployment  in  co-operation   with   the   SAPS,
additional capabilities may be required. That is why chapter 3,  clause  19,
of the Bill deals with police powers.

This Bill directly addresses the joint operation between the SAPS and  SANDF
in terms of clause 20, chapter 3, particularly clause 20(2). The powers  and
duties referred to here may only be exercised or performed for the  purposes
of  the  prevention  of  crime,  the  maintenance  of  law  and  order,  the
successful  execution  of  that  employment,  or  the  preservation  of  the
internal security of the Republic. This does not include  the  investigation
of crime when it comes to SANDF members employed by the SAPS.

Regarding international peace and  stability  obligations,  this  Bill  also
seeks to address the obligation of peace on  the  South  African  Government
and that of co-operation with other states. This is why we  need  to  deploy
our troops, if necessary, within the region and on the continent as a  whole
in pursuit of peacekeeping. Conflicts, if not  resolved,  impact  negatively
on neighbouring states in the form of a range of  nonmilitary  threats,  and
include the spread of disease,  large  numbers  of  refugees  and  displaced
people, and cross-border trafficking in drugs, stolen goods and small  arms.


Our country is committed to the development of a  common  security  approach
in Southern Africa. The SANDF could provide assistance in  many  ways,  such
as controlling cross-border traffic in small arms, training, education,  and
in upgrading weaponry and equipment. This will entail  SADC  states  shaping
their political, security and defence policies in  co-operation  with  other
states. The Government may be called on by neighbouring  states  to  play  a
number of supportive roles.

The discipline of our armed forces cannot be compromised. Any member of  the
force is subject to punishment and prosecution,  and  all  members  who  are
under instruction and training at any defence training institution, unit  or
base in the Republic are subject to the code.

If an instruction, order or command is not clear, conveyed  properly  or  in
the language understood by a particular uniformed personnel member,  soldier
or troop, who is to blame? Is it the poor soldier  or  officer  giving  that
order, instruction or command? In my view,  all  instructions  and  commands
are given to be understood. If not, the poor soldier should  not  be  blamed
or disciplined at all.

This takes me to the military justice system in  which  there  are  so  many
common offences, such as absenteeism, disobedience and insubordination.  Why
are there so  many  terminations  of  service  within  the  system?  Is  our
military justice system operating in the manner in which it is  supposed  to
operate in that justice should not only be done but should also be  seen  to
be done? If not, we need to look seriously at the system itself.

For example, how can one be confident of a system if, as an  accused  person
who is, say, African, one has to appear before  a  white  presiding  officer
and a white prosecutor, is being charged by a  white  person,  and  is  also
afforded an interpreter who does not understand one's language  and  culture
properly  and  has  to  expect   that   person   to   interpret   for   one?
[Interjections.]

Nobody would have any confidence in that arrangement, or in a  system  which
does not deal with  simple  administrative  justice  or  the  rights  of  an
accused person. Are our personnel, or line management,  trained  or  skilled
enough to understand fair procedures and  administrative  justice?  Why  are
there so many Africans who leave or  terminate  their  services  within  the
system? These are all questions without answers that need  to  be  answered,
not by a speaker or by the portfolio committee, but  by  the  Department  of
Defence. Those who are operating the system need to get down to business  as
a matter of extreme urgency.

The image of the Defence Force needs to prevail. It could  happen  that  the
issues raised above are the cause of incidents taking place at various  army
units and bases, such as the incidents in Bloemfontein, Limpopo, North  West
and many other areas in which uniformed personnel sometimes resort to arms.

We as the portfolio committee do not know why. We need to be told  by  those
who are responsible. Why are so many former African soldiers not  interested
in any of the armed forces, or why do they decide  to  leave  or  resort  to
committing so-called offences?

All these questions need to be answered. The Bill before  this  House  today
and other pieces of legislation seek to address these matters.  If  not,  we
need to look again at other pieces of legislation which were meant  to  deal
with these matters and recall them, amended if necessary.
This Bill should also be able to address the issue  of  different  cultures,
because it is very clear that within the force itself there are  individuals
who are not prepared to deal with  the  fact  that  there  are  other  force
members in uniform who may not share the same culture and  who  may  need  a
different approach to their culture. On the basis of that  there  are  those
who are intolerant of others and who have a very negative  attitude  towards
those who do not share their culture. All these matters may lead  to  nonco-
operation  amongst  force  members.  They  may  also  lead  to  absenteeism,
disobedience, insubordination and drunkenness.

These cultural matters need to addressed very  urgently  in  order  for  the
image  of  the  force  to  be  maintained.  They  also  sometimes  lead   to
discrimination by those who do not share the same  culture:  ``Therefore,  I
need to discriminate against you, or because of  my  seniority  I  can  then
undermine you''. If  discrimination  exists,  it  needs  to  be  eradicated,
uprooted and destroyed completely wherever it exists.

There is no place for any type of discrimination or undermining in terms  of
cultural matters by anybody in the Defence  Force.  We  call  on  those  who
experience this to come forward and use the Constitution  of  the  Republic,
which  protects  all  citizens  of  South  Africa  against   any   type   of
discrimination and racism and against any type of undermining by one  person
against another.

Never,  and  never  again,  will  any  citizen  of  South  Africa  feel  and
experience any  type  of  racism  or  discrimination,  or  racism  based  on
ethnicity; or will any citizen feel that his or her  religious  freedom  has
been undermined. All religious freedoms are guaranteed and protected by  our
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

This Bill also seeks to address representivity within the Defence  Force  at
all levels, because it is clear at  this  stage  that  representivity  is  a
problem in various ranks and in terms of gender.

When  the  portfolio  committee  visited  the  various  units  or  bases  it
discovered that there was a serious lack  of  representivity.  One  rank,  a
lower rank, would be dominated by one race and another rank, a senior  rank,
would  be  dominated  by  another  race.  This,  of  course,  needs  serious
attention. I hope the portfolio committee will deal with this. For  example,
how many African navy chiefs, drivers or commanders are commanding  or  will
command our ships and those coming into our waters? How  many  Africans  are
being trained to take over and command ships coming into our  waters?  [Time
expired]. [Applause.]

Mr A BLAAS: Madam Speaker, I would  just  like  to  react  to  some  of  the
remarks that the previous speaker made. It is my conviction that members  of
the Defence Force have moved well beyond any form of  discrimination  either
of the basis of colour, culture or race. If there  is  one  department  that
has gone a long way in trying to  eradicate  these  constraints  it  is  the
Defence Force. Granted there there may still be  work  to  be  done.  But  I
consider it unfair to make such remarks in this House; they do not  put  the
Defence Force in the right perspective.
Die verdedigingskonsepwet is 'n stuk wetgewing wat oor 'n lang  periode  kom
en waaraan baie tyd bestel is. Baie energie, beredenering  en  dinkwerk  ten
opsigte van  die  maatreÃ«l  het  bygedra  tot  die  tertafellegging  van  'n
weldeurdagte stuk wetgewing.  Weens  die  omvang  van  die  wetgewing,  moet
aanvaar word dat praktiese probleme kan ontstaan by die toepassing  hiervan.
In sulke gevalle sal die nodige wysigings noodwendig aangebring  moet  word.
Die NNP het  geen  besware  teen  die  beoogde  wetgewing  nie  en  sal  dit
gevolglik steun.

Soos reeds vermeld is, dit is 'n totale nuwe maatreÃ«l. Dis goed deurdink  en
gedebatteer en nie kontroversieel nie. Dit herroep 24 ander wette geheel  of
gedeeltelik.   Die    meerderheid    is    vorige    verdedigingswette    of
verdedigingswetswysigings.  Hierdie  wetsontwerp  bepaal  die  samestelling,
optrede en administrasie van die Suid Afrikaanse Nasionale Weermag.

Die filosofie agter hierdie wetgewing is  reeds  breedvoerig  aan  die  Huis
voorgelÃª, en ek gaan nie verder daarop kommentaar lewer nie.  Aangaande  die
inhoud van hierdie spesifieke wetgewing is  daar  'n  paar  aksente  wat  ek
graag wil noem. Die eerste is  die  samestelling  van  die  departement  van
verdediging. 'n Duidelike onderskeid word gemaak tussen die  burgerlike  rol
en die skerp kant van die weermag. Dit word gemanifesteer in  die  vestiging
van 'n Verdedigingsekretariaat en 'n Nasionale Weermag,  onder  afsonderlike
hoofde. Beide die Sekretaris van  Verdediging  en  die  Hoof  van  die  SANW
rapporteer aan die Minister. Die Sekretaris van die Weermag mag nie  'n  lid
van  die  weermag  wees  nie.  Hy  het  spesifieke,  gedelegeerde  magte  en
verantwoordelikhede. Die Sekretaris is dan ook die hoof-uitvoerende  beampte
en verantwoordelik ingevolge wetgewing op die bestuur van openbare fondse.

Die weermag vorm die skerp kant van  die  SANW.  Volgens  die  Grondwet,  is
hulle veronderstel om paraat te wees om die Republiek  teen  alle  moontlike
bedreigings te beskerm. Dit noodsaak dat wapentuig, magspeile  en  opleiding
so moet wees dat dit alle  waarskynlike  bedreiging,  in  ag  genome  sekere
risiko's, die hoof moet kan bied.
Die verdeling van die funksies tussen die sekretariaat en die  weermag  stel
egter    eise    aan    hierdie    verhoudings.    Dit    verg     toegewyde
kommunikasiemeganismes en-strukture om misverstande te voorkom.  Aanduidings
is dat daar maar van tyd tot tyd spanning  tussen  hierdie  twee  komponente
is.

Die burgerlike dimensie in die weermag het egter ook  voordele  deurdat  die
weermag nie meer 'n reguit sy eie is nie.

'n Verdere aspek is dat voorsiening  gemaak  word  vir  'n  voltydse  en  'n
reserwemag  binne  'n  eenmagkonsep.  Dit  beteken  dat  alle  lede  eenders
behandel moet word. Almal  is  vrywilligers.  Lede  van  die  reserwemag  is
deeltydse  lede  van  ander  beroepe,  maar   moet   beskikbaar   wees   vir
magsuitbreiding, indien nodig, en moet gevolglik ten volle opgelei wees  vir
die aangeduide take en moontlike bedreigings.

Die konsep gaan noodwendig addisionele druk  plaas  op  die  reeds  beperkte
operasionele fondse. Lede moet gewerf en opgelei word, en moet  uniforms  an
ander uitrusting ontvang. Hulle moet in  staat  wees  om  hul  taak  te  kan
verrig. Hulle is 'n integrerende  deel  van  die  weermag.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The draft defence Bill is a piece of legislation that has been a long  time
coming, and a lot of time has been spent on it.  A  great  deal  of  energy,
discussion and thought in  respect  of  the  Bill  has  contributed  to  the
tabling of a well-considered piece of legislation. Because of the  scope  of
the Bill, we must accept that practical problems can arise when we  come  to
its implementation. The necessary amendments would have to be brought  about
in such cases. The New NP has no objection to the proposed  legislation  and
will therefore support it.

As mentioned earlier, this is a totally new law. It has  been  well  thought
through and discussed, and is not controversial. It repeals  24  other  laws
entirely or partially. The majority are previous  defence  Acts  or  defence
amendment  Acts.  This  Bill  determines  the   composition,   conduct   and
administration of the South African National Defence Force.

The philosophy behind this law has been presented to the  House  in  detail,
and I will not comment any further on it. However, there are a few points  I
want to make about the contents of this specific  Bill.  The  first  is  the
composition of the Department  of  Defence.  A  clear  distinction  is  made
between the civic role and the sharp edge of  the  Defence  Force.  This  is
manifested in the establishment of a  Defence  Secretariat  and  a  National
Defence Force under separate leaders.

Both the Secretary of Defence and the Chief  of  the  SANDF  report  to  the
Minister. The Secretary of Defence may  not  be  a  member  of  the  Defence
Force. He has specific delegated powers and responsibilities. The  Secretary
is also the Chief Executive Officer, and is responsible in terms  of  public
financial management legislation.

The armed forces form  the  sharp  edge  of  the  SANDF.  According  to  the
Constitution, they are supposed  to  be  prepared  to  defend  the  Republic
against all possible threats. This means  that  weapons,  force  levels  and
training must be such that they can resist any apparent threat, taking  into
account certain risks.

The division of functions between  the  secretariat  and  the  armed  forces
does, however, place certain demands on  these  relationships.  It  requires
dedicated    communication    mechanisms    and    structures    to    avoid
misunderstandings. There are  indications  that  there  is  tension  between
these two components from time to time.

The civic dimension in the Defence Force has advantages  as  well,  however,
in that the Defence Force is no longer a  law  unto  itself.  An  additional
aspect is that provision is made for a full-time and a reserve force  within
a single-force concept. This means that all  members  must  be  treated  the
same. All are  volunteers.  Members  of  the  reserve  force  are  part-time
members in other professions, but must be available for force  expansion  if
needed, and must consequently be fully  trained  for  identified  tasks  and
possible threats.

The concept is, of  necessity  going  to  place  additional  strain  on  the
already limited operational funds. Members must be  recruited,  trained  and
issued with uniforms and other equipment. They have to be  able  to  perform
their functions. They are an integral part of the Defence Force.]

The employment of the National Defence Force is  another  issue  I  want  to
highlight.  In  addition  to  the   employment   as   anticipated   in   the
Constitution, the Defence Force may be deployed under  prescribed  rules  to
assist other departments and to effect national border control.

A clear distinction is drawn between border control  for  crime  prevention,
which the responsibility of the SA Police Service and only done  in  support
of  the  Police  Service,  and  national  border  control,  which   is   the
responsibility of the National Defence Force for the purpose  of  protecting
the integrity of the Republic. In the latter case, they have  very  specific
powers.

With reference to law  enforcement,  under  special  circumstances  military
vehicles and  personnel  of  the  Defence  Force  may  be  used  to  enforce
provincial and national laws. The general rule,  however,  is  that  Defence
personnel do not have law-enforcement powers. They  operate  in  support  of
other  departments.  The  military  police,  however,  have  law-enforcement
powers in respect of members of the Defence Force.

In conclusion, these are but a few aspects of  a  very  comprehensive  Bill.
One fundamental principle apparent in  this  Bill  is  that  the  rights  of
Defence Force members are protected in a fair  and  reasonable  manner.  The
defence structure is not a law on its own. The respective  councils,  boards
and other mechanisms ensure an open and fair  compensation  to  all  members
without compromising the discipline and requirements of the  Defence  Force.
The Defence Force is focused on defence and trained to  do  just  that,  and
will only be used for that purpose.

This Bill is a  well-thought-through,  comprehensive  piece  of  legislation
which the New NP will definitely support.

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, as we  have  not  been  allocated  sufficient
time for a proper debate, I am, accordingly, unable to do  justice  to  this
debate. However, I would like to  issue  a  challenge  to  the  Minister  on
whether it is prudent to expand the  role  of  Defence,  as  we  have  done,
without increasing the budget.

It is a relief that we finally have a  Defence  Bill.  There  is  no  doubt,
though, that there is room for  improvement  in  the  future.  There  is  an
ongoing challenge in the text of the Bill to enshrine the culture  of  human
rights  constitutionalism  whilst  fostering  discipline.   Discipline   and
freedom are difficult principles  to  marry.  This  Bill  has  attempted  to
strike this delicate balance. The challenge in Defence is  to  educate  line
managers in middle management to embrace the  culture  of  human  rights  in
their leadership.

Chapter 3 of the Bill is of  special  importance  in  my  view,  because  it
ensures the separation of powers between the Chief of the Defence Force  and
the Defence Secretariat to ensure a degree of  civil  military  control.  It
also gives Parliament an opportunity  to  veto  a  budget  if  it  deems  it
necessary to do so.

Although necessary at this stage, we must  reach  a  time  when  Defence  is
completely relieved of police functions. The Defence powers of  arrest  will
undoubtedly precipitate territorial tensions between the two forces. In  the
end, the police must be capacitated to play their role  effectively.  Having
said this, we support the Bill.

Mr K W MORWAMOCHE: Madam Speaker and hon members, the Defence  Bill  outlaws
racism and sexism in the armed forces and proposes stiff jail sentences  for
soldiers who break the law. It will transform the  lives  of  those  in  the
military.
The Bill brings Defence legislation in line with the  Constitution  and  the
Bill of Rights by allowing soldiers to  join  unions,  thereby  giving  them
speedy and fair access to justice in the military.  The  Bill  will  mandate
officers presiding over disciplinary cases to hand down maximum  jail  terms
of five years, without the option of  a  fine,  on  members  who  are  found
guilty.

The Bill seeks to replace the present apartheid legislation as  the  current
Act is a relic of apartheid. The new Bill seeks  to  bring  Defence  matters
into line with the Constitution, the new military  disciplinary  legislation
and the White Paper on Defence. The present Defence  Act  is  considered  an
offensive apartheid handbook, because it  still  refers  to  terrorists  and
contains other measures that are no longer appropriate.

The proposed Act does not emanate from, or is  a  direct  response  to,  the
much-publicised  shooting  at  Tempe,  but  it   will   undoubtedly   punish
perpetrators of such incidents.

The Defence Bill is one of three pieces of legislation that aim to make  the
SA National Defence Force a more culturally sensitive organisation  that  is
home to all, black and white. It aims to ensure that there is not  a  repeat
of racially motivated incidents such as the one which occurred at Tempe.

As I have said, this Bill is not a response to the shooting  at  Tempe,  but
it has certainly made the proposed law much more important, if  not  urgent.
Racism is not only confined to the army;  it  is  a  societal  problem.  But
surely the army is one organ  of  state  in  which  one  cannot  afford  the
effects of racist behaviour?

When members of the US army were on board a ship, fighting the Vietnam  War,
black and white soldiers literally fought each other all the way. We  cannot
allow such a cancerous situation  to  happen  in  the  SA  National  Defence
Force.  Commanding  officers  who  tolerate  or,  even   worse,   perpetuate
discrimination are not  fit  for  public  office  and  should  therefore  be
removed  from  such  positions.  The  military  disciplinary  code  and  the
Military Discipline Supplementary Measures Act  have  also  made  discipline
more friendly to the accused in military hearings.

[Mr Chairperson and hon members, Chapter 10 gives the Minister the power  to
consider requests from the Chief of the Defence  Force  for  land  on  which
soldiers may conduct training exercises,  regardless  of  whether  the  land
falls under traditional leader and his or her subjects or whether  it  is  a
privately  owned  farm.  This  chapter  allows  the  Minister  to  make   an
announcement in the Government Gazette, in two official languages  that  are
used in the area in which the piece of land  that  the  Minister  wishes  to
give to soldiers is located. The Minister will seek out a representative  of
that tribe or the person whose farm they want to use. They may use it for  a
long time or for a short time.

The Minister and the representative will negotiate an amount  that  will  be
paid as compensation for  using  the  land.  This  shows  that  the  ANC-led
Government is not like previous governments,  where  it  was  common  for  a
person to wake up in the morning only to find  soldiers  erecting  tents  on
his or her land, and when they objected they  were  threatened  with  death.
This means that our Minister of Defence will negotiate with each  and  every
person who falls under this democratically elected Government on the use  of
his or her land.

After the temporary use of the land, the soldiers will  ensure  that  it  is
cleared of all potential hazards that the owner  may  encounter  after  they
have left. They will ensure that no bullets or bombs are left  behind  where
the soldiers were being trained.]

Ek wil die wens uitspreek dat die pad wat vir die Minister  van  Verdediging
voorlÃª, altyd skoon sal wees. [Applous.] [I want to express  the  wish  that
the  road  ahead  for  the  Minister  of  Defence  will  always  be   clear.
[Applause.]]

Mnr P  J  GROENEWALD:  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  kort  titel  van  hierdie
wetsontwerp sÃª dit is om voorsiening te maak vir  die  verdediging  van  die
Republiek, en vir sake wat daarmee verband hou.

Verskeie sprekers het gesÃª  dat  hierdie  wetsontwerp  die  nÃ¡-apartheidsera
inlei. Dit sluit ook die era van die integrasieproses van sewe  verskillende
weermagte af. Ons moet nou besef dat daardie prosesse afgehandel is, en  dat
ons moet vorentoe kyk na die nuwe weermag.

Klousule 64 in hierdie  Wetsontwerp  op  Verdediging  handel  spesifiek  oor
dissipline. Dit was nog  altyd  die  VF  se  standpunt  dat  'n  weermag  so
effektief is soos wat sy  dissipline  is.  As  daar  nie  dissipline  in  'n
weermag is nie, het 'n mens nie 'n goeie weermag nie.
Ek het die agb Adjunkminister 'n vraag gevra na aanleiding van  gerugte  dat
daar mense is wat by die huis sit en wat 'n vol salaris kry,  maar  wat  nie
rapporteer vir diens nie. Die agb Minister het my  geantwoord  dat  daar  17
senior offisiere is wat 'n salaris van R274 515 per maand verdien, maar  nie
vir diens rapporteer nie. Dit beteken daar is R3,3  miljoen  per  jaar,  van
die belastingbetaler se geld, wat betaal word vir mense wat  nie  rapporteer
vir diens nie.

Daar is gerugte in omloop dat daar senior offisiere is wat selde nugter  is,
en daarom nie kan rapporteer vir diens nie. Ek wil  die  agb  Adjunkminister
vra om hierdie gerugte stop te sit deur vir ons te sÃª hoekom  hierdie  mense
nie by die werk is nie, hoekom  hulle  by  die  huis  sit  en  hoekom  hulle
salarisse  kry.  Dit  getuig  van  swak  dissipline.  Ons  moet   dissipline
terugbring; anders beteken hierdie  wetsontwerp  niks  nie.  Ten  spyte  van
alles, sal die VF  hierdie  wetsontwerp  steun.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, the short title of this Bill says  it  is
to provide for the defence of the Republic and matters connected therewith.

Several speakers have said that this Bill ushers in the post-apartheid  era.
This also concludes the era of the integration process  of  seven  different
defence  forces.  We  must  now  realise  that  these  processes  have  been
finalised and that we should look ahead to the new Defence Force.

Clause 64 in this Defence Bill deals specifically with  discipline.  It  has
always been the viewpoint of  the  FF  that  a  defence  force  is  only  as
effective as its discipline is. If there  is  no  discipline  in  a  defence
force, then one does not have a good defence force.

I asked the hon Deputy Minister a question on account of rumours that  there
are people sitting at home and receiving  a  full  salary  but  who  do  not
report for duty. The hon Minister answered my question  that  there  are  17
senior officers who receive a salary of R274 515 per month, but who  do  not
report for duty. This means that R3,3 million of the  taxpayers'  money  are
being paid to people per annum who do not report for duty.

There are rumours doing the rounds that there are senior  officers  who  are
seldom sober, and for that reason cannot report for duty. I want to ask  the
hon Deputy Minister to stop these rumours by telling  us  why  these  people
are not at work, why they are sitting at home and  why  they  are  receiving
salaries. This attest to poor discipline. We should bring  back  discipline,
otherwise this Bill means nothing. Despite everything the  FF  will  support
this Bill.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the  Defence  Bill  is  a  most  comprehensive
Bill, touching on almost every aspect of the  defence  of  our  country.  It
replaces and repeals all previous Acts, 43  of  them,  from  1961  to  1997.
These Acts were passed by the South African Parliament  and  parliaments  of
the homelands of Venda, Ciskei, Transkei and Bophuthatswana.

The task of integrating the old defence  force  of  the  Republic  of  South
Africa, the liberation armed forces and the armies of the  homelands  was  a
daunting one, but also one that was undertaken  with  great  zeal  and  was,
relatively-speaking,  achieved.  There  could  still  be   pockets   needing
integration and fine-tuning.

The Bill has many significant  characteristics,  but  only  a  few  will  be
commented upon. The Bill brings the Defence Force into line with the  Public
Service, creating a strong civic administrative  wing  under  the  Secretary
for Defence. The duties and  powers  of  the  Defence  Secretariat  and  the
Secretary for Defence are well defined.

The Bill also redefines the role, duties and powers  of  the  Chief  of  the
Defence Force in such a way that he has  a  clear  focus  and  role  as  the
military, operational and administrative head of the Defence Force.

The other area that is clarified  in  the  Bill  is  that  of  the  military
police. The task of the military wing in the sphere of policing is  crucial,
particularly when it is expected in modern times that the  country  and  the
world will be living in peace  times.  Internal  peacekeeping  becomes  very
important,  and  a  relationship  with  the  normal  police  department   is
necessary.

The army in modern times is expected to contribute to peace in  neighbouring
states. With the advent of the African Union,  the  country  needs  a  well-
trained army to  discharge  its  responsibility  in  maintaining  peace  and
development in Africa. This represents a new area of  responsibility,  which
is exciting and challenging.

The Defence Bill will modernise our armed forces and enable them to  reflect
the values enshrined in our Constitution and the Bill  of  Rights.  The  PAC
supports this Bill.

Mr S B NTULI: Madam Speaker, colleagues, hon Minister of Defence  and  other
Ministers, and members, I am delighted to participate in this  debate  today
because it is historic in the sense that  it  takes  place  in  August,  the
month in which  women  of  this  country  marched  to  protest  against  the
discriminatory pass laws and apartheid.

This debate is also significant in the sense  that  this  is  the  month  in
which this Bill is passed, and we can proudly say today after so many  years
that there is transformation in the SANDF. For the first time we have  women
generals: Maj Gen Sedibe and Maj Gen Van der Poel. [Applause.]

I  read  in  the  paper  about  the  initiative  by  Portnet,  one  of   the
parastatals, to have a ship sailed and  manned  by  women  only  sailing  in
South African waters. This also shows that if those women in the 1950s  were
marching at the time to identify themselves with the  struggle,  today  they
should see that things did not just end there with the  pass  laws,  because
even now  there  are  skills  and  opportunities  opening  up  to  them.  We
congratulate them. [Applause.]

Therefore, we in the ANC obviously  commend  and  congratulate  the  Defence
Force, and congratulate Portnet on its venture. We also urge the  Department
of Defence to look into the environmental and working  conditions  of  women
to enable them to perform their duties in a way that is equivalent  to  that
of their male counterparts.

The Bill states that the functions of the Chief  of  the  SANDF  are,  among
other things, that he or she ``is  responsible  for  the  development  of  a
nonracial, nonsexist and nondiscriminatory institutional culture within  the
Defence Force in accordance with the Constitution  and  departmental  policy
on equal opportunity and affirmative action''.

In order  for  this  function  to  become  realisable,  it  means  that  the
Department of Defence should do certain things,  among  other  things,  with
regard to transformation. In terms of transformation there are  areas  which
warrant serious attention in order to improve the image and  performance  of
our Defence Force. An example regarding regimental sergeant majors  is  that
there is a dire need for the department to look at the role and  composition
of the ranks component of regimental sergeant majors within  the  SANDF  and
to see if it is in line with the transformation  agenda  envisaged  in  this
Defence Bill and espoused in the Constitution.

The department should look into whether this unit or level of  authority  is
representative enough. Does it have  equity?  Does  redress  apply  in  this
area? Most importantly, the department should look  into  whether  the  unit
lives up to its functional expectations.

Another important aspect of transformation  is  the  need  for  the  correct
ranking of Defence Force members.  In  1955  the  ANC  crafted  the  Freedom
Charter, which states in the 8th heading that  the  doors  of  learning  and
culture shall be opened  to  all.  Thus,  the  question  the  Department  of
Defence needs to answer is: Is the department doing enough to  create  space
for skills development for its members? Alternatively, does  the  Department
of Defence create opportunities for serving members of  the  Defence  Force,
excluding those who are working as civilians in the Defence Force? Does  the
department create opportunities for serving members to have  a  career  path
beyond their time of service?

Once these serving members of the Defence Force acquire  or  pass  military-
related studies, does the SANDF appreciate them and rank  them  accordingly?
It is important that this be done in order to boost  the  soldiers'  morale,
improve  their  socioeconomic  situation  and  enhance  their   professional
soldiering skills. This is why the  Freedom  Charter's  statement  that  the
doors of learning and culture shall be opened to all is relevant.

Appropriate ranking will also facilitate transformation within  the  Defence
Force  establishment  to   ensure   gender   equity,   affirmative   action,
representivity, and the whole transformation of the Defence Force  in  order
for it to be in line with our Constitution.

Appropriate ranking will  also  accelerate  transformation  in  the  reserve
force, as we are aware that in respective areas one finds that  the  reserve
force, when operating on a mission, is not reflective of  society.  We  have
already had reports of some of the negative acts  that  emanate  from  these
kinds of operations that lack representivity.

I also want to turn to civic education. This unit needs to be revisited.  As
part of the transformation process, society  is  now  exposed  to  different
cultures,  religions,  genders  and  different  practices  which  constitute
societal diversity.

We are also called  upon  to  play  a  role  in  Africa  through  the  Nepad
programme. In addition to  the  professional  capabilities  of  our  Defence
Force, issues of gender equity, human rights and labour rights are  becoming
more pertinent.

I will now focus on the functions of the military police. The Bill  provides
clear guidance on how the military police should  execute  their  work.  For
the purposes of enforcing this Act or any other law,  including  the  common
law in so far as it applies to the department, any  member  or  employee  of
the department,  or  to  any  person,  area,  land  or  premises  under  the
protection or control of the Department, a member  of  the  military  police
should help in the prevention and combating of crime, the  investigation  of
offences and the maintenance of law and order.

Whilst exercising these powers, the military  police  should  act  with  the
necessary precaution. For example, once they arrest a criminal, they  should
hand the criminal over to the police as soon as possible so that  this  does
not actually have implications for the  limited  resources  of  the  Defence
Force. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, it must have been a  mammoth  task  to  draw  up
this unique piece of legislation. The mere fact that about 50 separate  Acts
have been consolidated  into  one  standard  Bill  on  the  SANDF  is  proof
positive, and this  document  provides  everyone  in  South  Africa  with  a
blueprint of our National Defence  Force.  The  AEB  congratulates  everyone
concerned and we support this Bill.

We have three requests. In  the  first  instance,  clause  19  of  the  Bill
provides that units of the Defence Force may be employed to help the  Police
Service in the combating of crime and  the  reservation  of  law  and  order
within the Republic. Clause 35 states that the  intelligence  division  must
co-operate with any other intelligence service or body created by  or  under
any other law.

Die AEB vra dat die Weermag se intelligensiediens aangewend word om eens  en
vir altyd die magte wat agter plaasmoorde in  Suid-Afrika  werksaam  is,  te
ontmasker. Pas verlede  week  nog,  is  'n  regse  komplot  teen  die  staat
ontbloot en die verdagtes gearresteer. Proaktief, voordat  enige  bose  daad
nog gepleeg kon word, is opgetree.

Waarom kan dieselfde uitnemendheid nie aangewend word  om  plaasmoorde  eens
en vir altyd hok te slaan nie? GekoÃ¶rdineerde aksie tussen die polisie,  die
weermag en die intelligensiediens is noodsaaklik om agter die bron  van  die
aanvalle te kom. Om die uitvoerders van plaasaanvalle te arresteer,  is  nie
genoeg nie. Die beplanners en instigeerders moet  ontmasker  en  uitgeskakel
word.

Tweedens beplan die SANW nuwe rangkentekens regdeur, en teen hoÃ«  koste.  In
die lig van die Minister se antwoord verlede week  in  hierdie  Huis  op  'n
vraag van die AEB dat die burgermag begrotingsgewys aan die agterspeen  moet
suig, doen die AEB 'n beroep op die Minister. Laat vaar die nuwe  rangtekens
en wend daardie miljoene aan vir die opleiding van ons reserwemagte.

In artikel 74 maak die wet voorsiening vir reÃ«ls en  regulasies  in  verband
met medaljes en  dekorasies.  Onlangs  is  medaljes  van  45  verdienstelike
gevalle weerhou, omdat daar, soos in die pers beweer is,  nie  genoeg  swart
kandidate was vir medaljes nie. Kan die Minister duidelik sÃª  of  die  reÃ«ls
wat kragtens artikel 74 geld, meriete as maatstaf gaan hÃª, sodat elkeen  wat
'n medalje verdien, dit wel kry, en sodat elkeen wat dit kry,  weet  dat  hy
het dit verdien. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The AEB asks that the Defence Force's  intelligence  services  be  used  to
uncover once and for all the forces that are behind farm  murders  in  South
Africa. Just last week a right-wing plot against  the  state  was  uncovered
and the suspects were arrested. Action  was  taken  proactively  before  any
evil deed could even be committed.

Why can the same excellence not be applied to eliminate  farm  murders  once
and for all? Co-ordinated action between the police, the Defence  Force  and
the intelligence services  is  essential  to  discover  the  source  of  the
attacks. It is not enough to arrest the perpetrators of  farm  murders.  The
planners and instigators must be uncovered and eliminated.

Secondly, the SA National  Defence  Force  is  planning  new  rank  insignia
throughout, and at great cost. In the light of  the  Minister's  reply  last
week in this House to a  question  from  the  AEB  that  the  citizen  force
suckles from the hindmost teat as far as the budget is  concerned,  the  AEB
wants to make an appeal to the Minister. He should  give  up  the  new  rank
insignia and apply those millions to the training of our reserve forces.

Section 74  of  the  Act  makes  provision  for  rules  and  regulations  in
connection with medals and decorations. Recently medals were  withheld  from
45 deserving cases because, as was alleged in  the  press,  there  were  not
enough black candidates for medals. Can the  Minister  clearly  say  whether
the rules applicable in terms of clause 74 will have merit  as  a  yardstick
so that everyone who deserves a medal will get one  and  that  everyone  who
gets a medal will know that he or she deserves it?]

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Madam Speaker, Minister, members, this Bill  is  necessary
to regulate the  activities  of  the  Department  of  Defence,  the  Defence
Secretariat and the SA  National  Defence  Force.  It  covers  many  aspects
relating to defence, and I hope that it will enable the SANDF to  carry  out
its constitutional  mandate  to  ``defend  and  protect  the  Republic,  its
territorial integrity and its people in accordance with the Constitution''.

The Bill covers other  functions,  such  as  assistance  to  the  SA  Police
Service. We are aware that this is not an ideal task for the SANDF. At  this
stage, however, the SAPS do not have the capacity to effectively combat  all
forms  of  crime,  specifically  cross-border  crime.  The  committee   made
provision for this in clause 18(1)(d) of the Bill, in  terms  of  which  the
President may employ the SANDF to effect national border control. This  must
be carried out in conjunction with clause 20(11) which states  that  members
of the Defence  Force  must  receive  appropriate  training  prior  to  such
employment and must be equipped accordingly. Armed  with  this  legislation,
the SANDF may legitimately protect  our  citizens  on  the  borders  of  our
country.

Clause 89 of this Bill also allows the President to instruct  the  SANDF  to
carry out its constitutional mandate, as mentioned earlier,  by  proclaiming
a state of national defence. The state of national defence may  be  declared
not only during war,  or  armed  attack  or  conflict,  but  includes  other
contingencies such as biological or chemical warfare and even cyber attack.
As we move deeper into the new millennium, this provision  may  need  to  be
revised in the future to  make  provision  for  biological  manipulation  of
human beings such as in cloning; in robot and nanotechnology;  and  even  in
conflicts in and for control over outer space. Military terminology  in  the
United States already includes terms  such  as  satellite  defence  systems,
microrobots,   unmanned   armoured   vehicles   and    performance-enhancing
exoskeletons.

The new world is one in which the nation-state as we know it  is  playing  a
diminishing role,  and  organisations,  institutions  and  individuals  that
operate across national boundaries will be able  to  threaten  the  personal
security,  way  of  life  and  economic  welfare  of  our   people   without
threatening our country's territorial integrity.

We will have to be progressive in our approach  to  the  new  threats.  This
requires not only an evolving  constitutional  and  legal  framework  and  a
vibrant  and   flexible   socioeconomic   network,   but   also   a   modern
technologically sound security apparatus to deal with possible threats  that
may emerge. This Bill may serve our purposes at present,  but  I  foresee  a
very different  Defence  Bill  that  regulates  very  different  notions  of
defence and defence force in the future.

In closing, allow me once again to thank the members of the department,  and
the state law advisers  who  assisted  and  advised  the  committee  on  all
aspects relating to this  Bill.  Their  input  is  greatly  appreciated  and
valued. The DA supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L V J NGCULU: Madam Speaker, today  we  are  debating  the  Defence  Bill
eight years after the advent of democracy in our  country.  Cynics  may  say
that we have delayed an important piece of legislation, legislation that  is
central to the stability of our democracy and security of South Africa.

Yet, given the critical importance of this  legislation,  it  was  necessary
that it not be rushed, as its implications were far-reaching. It is  in  the
nature of the ANC never to be sporadic in its approach, but to be guided  by
the careful consideration of the interests of the country.

We believe that the  process  is  more  important  than  just  the  outcome.
Therefore, the decision was that the route to  the  adoption  of  this  Bill
would be consultative in order for it to be credible and acceptable  to  all
South Africans, including serving members of the security forces.

So the Government continued  to  rely  on  the  old  Defence  Act  of  1957,
together with other supplementary pieces of legislation.  Some  would  decry
this is an act of capitulation, but  it  was  important  to  take  one  step
forward and two steps backward whose displacement value  was  the  stability
of the country. This had its hiccups and some resented this,  but  today  we
cannot deny the fact that this was visionary leadership on the part  of  our
Government.

The then Minister of Defence, the late Comrade Joe  Modise,  in  his  wisdom
decided to set up a work group comprising the Department of  Defence,  other
relevant government departments, Parliament and civil  society  whose  brief
was to produce a piece of legislation that would be acceptable  to  all.  In
this way, the Bill was subjected to  the  most  thorough  deliberations  and
debates in which everyone's views mattered. Thereafter, the very  same  Bill
had to undergo a similar process in the portfolio committee deliberations.

We therefore stand on this podium today confident that the  Bill  before  us
is something we all can identify ourselves with. We  are  excited  that  our
Parliament is once again adopting a piece of legislation that has  been  the
subject of public participation.

This Defence Bill seeks to repeal the 1957 Defence Act and  to  provide  for
defence in a democracy. Of course, the provision in  the  1957  Act  dealing
with the military disciplinary  code  will  be  dealt  with  in  a  separate
process.

The Bill establishes the position of the Secretary for Defence as  the  head
of department and the accounting officer. This is a provision  that  clearly
subjects the uniformed members,  in  particular,  to  civilian  control.  It
further outlines the principles in terms of which any member of the  Defence
Force or auxiliary service and any employee must exercise his or her  powers
in the execution of his or her duties.

These principles emphasise the following. The formulation and  execution  of
defence policy is subject to the authority of Parliament  and  the  national
executive. The primary objective of the  Defence  Force  is  to  defend  and
protect the Republic, its people and its territorial integrity. The  Defence
Force must perform its functions in accordance  with  the  Constitution  and
international law. No member of the Defence  Force  may  obey  a  manifestly
illegal order. The Defence Force must respect  the  fundamental  rights  and
dignity of its members and of all people.

It is clear from the aforementioned that the issue of the  constitutionality
and accountability of the Defence Force is embedded in this Bill.  The  Bill
clearly spells out the powers of the Minister when it comes to  the  Defence
Force and the Department of Defence, and that the Minister may do  or  cause
to be done all things which are necessary  for  the  effective  defence  and
protection of the Republic, its territory and its inhabitants.

The Bill also confirms the provision  in  the  Constitution  that  only  the
President may authorise the deployment of the Defence Force,  and  that  the
President must inform Parliament promptly and in appropriate detail  of  the
reasons, place, number and duration of such deployment. It is  important  to
highlight that this Bill outlines the role  and  accountability  of  defence
intelligence  to  the  Minister  of  Defence  in  accordance  with  relevant
legislation, and that the inspector general of the department  must  monitor
the personnel structures of, adherence to the  law  and  procedures  by  and
activities of the intelligence division.

In other words, the Bill in front of us is  a  Bill  that  firmly  puts  our
Defence Force and the country among  the  nations  that  respect  civil  and
democratic control. It is also unequivocally  clear  that  the  Constitution
reigns supreme and that Parliament is where everybody accounts.

Never again will it be possible for politicians and officers  to  abuse  the
Defence Force for narrow ends. Never again can those who abuse  the  Defence
Force claim ignorance or be excused for turning a  blind  eye.  Never  again
should the Defence Force be regarded as an  aggressor  in  the  region,  but
rather as a bringer of peace, stability and friendship  to  the  nations  on
the continent.

There are some in this House and outside it who would like  to  portray  the
Defence Force, that is, the SA National Defence Force,  as  incompetent  and
unable to fulfil its duties. What  is  unfortunate  is  that  most  of  them
served in the old SADF without question or murmur.

Characteristic of this particular trend is what we actually  heard  the  hon
Schmidt say  today.  This  represents,  in  particular,  the  characteristic
nature  of  the  DA:  that  nothing   out   of   South   Africa   is   good.
[Interjections.] They continue to  adopt  an  apocalyptic  attitude  to  the
democratic dispensation.

Hence, one will find the hon  Schmidt  complaining  in  portfolio  committee
meetings that he is tired of transformation. He  complains  about  old  age,
HIV/Aids,  buildings,  lack  of  equipment,  etc.  Yet,  very  recently,  we
discussed in this House the terms  of  the  armaments  acquisition  and  the
joint investigation report. Again, it was the very same DA that  strenuously
in this House  opposed  the  acquisition  process.  Yet  today  he  has  the
audacity to complain of the lack of equipment. What a despicable display  of
hypocrisy!

The hon Schmidt complains about the old age of members and there  being  too
many generals. Perhaps the hon member has a short memory.  For  the  record,
he should be reminded that the current Defence Force is the  result  of  the
amalgamation  of  seven  armies.  I  repeat:  It  is  the  result   of   the
amalgamation of seven armies, and is not the SADF in which the  hon  Schmidt
served. Maybe the hon Schmidt  would  have  liked  to  see  members  of  the
liberation armies laid off. Of course, if members  had  been  laid  off,  he
should be reminded, there would have been disaster, anarchy and conflict  in
our country. Integration was the necessary route to take for  the  stability
and security of our country.

All ranks, therefore, of those who served  should  and  must  be  respected.
Some, in particular those in the liberation  movement,  also  served  for  a
very long time, most of  them  from  its  inception  in  1961  when  MK  was
actually founded. They may be old in the eyes of the hon Schmidt, but to  us
they served honourably the  cause  of  liberation.  [Applause.]  Of  course,
looking through the racist prism of the DA, they are perhaps a spent  force.
[Interjections.] The ``old'' is seen by  the  DA  to  mean  only  those  who
served in the liberation movement,  but  there  are  also  old  members  who
actually served in the old defence force.
We must confirm and be proud that the Defence  Force  is  founded  today  on
principles  of  constitutionality  and  democratic   accountability,   these
principles actually making up a historic mission for the Defence Force.

They forget that the Defence Force today is imbued  with  democratic  values
and enjoys much support. Those of us who  have  studied  peoples'  wars  and
done military studies all know that no force on earth can defeat  a  defence
force supported by the people and founded on democratic values.  [Applause.]
We should therefore reject all such  insinuations  with  the  contempt  they
deserve. The SANDF today stands respected not only in South Africa,  but  on
the continent and abroad.

We take this opportunity to remember in particular the late Joe  Modise  who
steered MK and later  the  new  SANDF  to  levels  cherished  by  all  South
Africans.

As we celebrate this Defence Bill, we are reminded of  the  epitaph  at  the
Elmina Castle in Ghana. It says, and I quote:


  In everlasting glory of the anguish of our ancestors. May those who  died
  rest in peace. May those who returned  find  their  roots.  May  humanity
  never again perpetuate such injustice against humanity. We the living vow
  to uphold this.

We support the Defence Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, having listened to the members of  the
various parties comment on this Bill I am also taking  this  opportunity  to
cast my mind back in history. I am reminded as I look across the House  that
on many occasions we traversed the length and breadth of our country in  the
eighties with individuals like Prof Mohamed, Mawa Ram Cobin and  Dr  Jassat.
We listened to voices including that of  Norman  Middleton  and  many  other
individuals from within our  communties  at  that  time,  a  time  when  the
previous regime offered the tricameral solution.
As we addressed meetings, some of those people I mentioned  said:  ``We  are
being offered fake votes - the tricameral parliament - so  that  we  may  be
conscripted to carry real bullets against our own people.''

I think it is important this afternoon to recall that  and  to  be  grateful
that, as a result of  those  efforts,  South  Africans  today  are  able  to
conclude and adopt a piece of  legislation  that  pulls  them  together  and
places them as one solid united people that will  confront  the  enemies  of
their country without taking each other's lives.

It is efforts like those that we have  to  acknowledge  this  afternoon.  We
also have to address  the  question  raised  of  why  some  members  of  the
National Defence Force have been granted permission to stay at  home  whilst
they receive their salaries.  We  must  look  at  that  question  seriously,
because that step has been taken. I have authorised it, and that is what  is
happening now.

It is happening because, at that time, the men and women  who  were  driving
towards a democratic future had no pension payouts. They  had  no  guarantee
of any future when their years of retirement came.

This Parliament has been very sensitive to  this  question.  It  has  passed
legislation authorising the executive to level out the  pension  payouts  of
those who served in the SA Defence force and other statutory forces, and  to
bring them on par with those who came from the liberation forces who had  no
pension payouts  whatsoever.  It  has  taken  the  executive  some  time  to
implement this. Many of these men and women are long past  their  retirement
age. They are old; some of them are  ill.  I  could  not  insist  that  they
report for duty every day, but I could  not  dismiss  them  without  pension
payouts.

I therefore accepted the advice of my directors-general that they should  be
allowed to stay at home whilst we finalise these pension  payouts,  because,
in any event, we have an excess of personnel in the National  Defence  Force
today. Now I can inform Parliament that we  are  ready  to  proceed,  and  I
therefore retire them now. [Applause]. So that is the reason.  There  is  no
other hidden agenda.

I also want to say in very brief terms that the National Defence Force is  a
voluntary force today. If there are people who are not  happy  to  serve  in
the National Defence Force in terms of the  conditions  that  prevail  there
today, they are free to resign and seek employment elsewhere. [Applause.]

But if there are people who  think  that  they  can  stay  in  the  National
Defence Force and transgress the law  and  codes  of  the  National  Defence
Force, they will find that there is no patience whatsoever with  them.  This
is because the SA National Defence Force  remains  a  military  institution.
There are some individuals who are trying to misuse  the  advantage  of  the
military unions. I want to say for the record that they are called  military
unions, but they are not unions in the traditional sense that  Cosatu  is  a
union or any other of the other labour unions.

These are actually associations. They are associations intended  to  provide
members of the National Defence force with additional  mechanisms  by  which
they can draw our attention and Government's attention to  the  problems  or
difficulties they may experience, but they are not unions.

There are therefore special regulations.  No  member  of  these  unions  may
belong to any union formation that is allied to a political party,  because,
in terms of the Defence Bill, no member of the National  Defence  Force  may
further or prejudice the interest of any political party. A  member  of  the
National Defence Force found busy with such activity as may  be  interpreted
in this way, will be in trouble with me, with the department  and  with  the
legal processes of the country.

The SANDF must serve the people of South Africa without exception.  And  the
SANDF requires men and women who  are  loyal;  who  devote  themselves  like
former President Nelson Mandela and like so many  of  our  people  who  gave
their lives to advance the freedom and democracy of this  country.  That  is
who we want there. One serves under  special  circumstances,  and  sometimes
one might not be happy with the conditions.  But  one  is  there  first  and
foremost because one has chosen to serve the people in that capacity.

Therefore, this talk that I lack political will by children  who  were  only
born after we had brought about democracy, who were not there  when  I  went
to jail, who were not there when we were eating mealies  on  Robben  Island,
must stop. [Laughter.] [Interjections.] A level of humility is required.

Before young  stars  speak  on  this  issue,  they  should  really  consider
carefully who they are  talking  to  and  what  they  are  saying  to  them.
[Applause].

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

             STATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Chairperson,  hon
members, prior to the year 2000  the  provision  of  information  technology
services and goods to Government  was  fragmented.  This  is  precisely  why
today we bring before this House the debate on the Sita amending Bill -  the
State Information Technology Agency Amendment Bill.

In terms of this IT fragmentation in Government, almost every  department  -
through its own mechanisms and the state tender board  -  bought,  developed
and maintained its own information systems.

Government information  and  technology  was  clearly  in  quite  a  chaotic
situation. Largely exploited by the industry, which  was  aware  that  there
was a lack of co-ordination  among  Government  departments,  this  industry
could  hence  sell  any  system  or  product  to   government   departments,
irrespective of whether the systems or products were able to interrelate  to
one another.

Drastic measures had  to  be  undertaken  to  rationalise  and  improve  the
control and delivery of information  technology  to  Government.  The  State
Information Technology Agency was established to address this  urgent  need.
As a result of the promulgation of the State Information  Technology  Agency
Act - Sita - in 1998, Sita came into being.

The Act provided for the compulsory  participation  by  all  departments  in
Sita  as  and  when  requested  by  departments  and  approved  by  Cabinet.
Government eagerly awaited the benefits that were  to  be  realised  through
the establishment of Sita.  But  it  soon  became  evident  that  the  State
Information Technology Agency could not be all  things  to  all  clients  or
government departments.

As  we  redefine  our  understanding  of  the  needs  of  Government  in   a
transforming  society  and  as  Government  and,  indeed,  the   world   are
increasingly reliant on information technology for  the  effective  delivery
of goods and services, it becomes necessary to review, revise and renew  our
approach to the provision of IT services.

The Presidential Review  Commission  highlighted  this  prior  to  the  1999
elections, in which it indicated that Government was faced by  a  number  of
serious issues in the information technology environment.

The following  major  issues  were  identified  then,  and  many  are  still
apparent today. Government is without doubt the biggest  spender  on  IT  in
South Africa. The return on investment, or the  value  added  to  Government
services and  to  the  citizens  of  the  Republic,  is  difficult,  if  not
impossible, to measure.

Departments were operating in an information technology vacuum.  There  were
duplications of applications and systems, and the benefits  of  co-operation
and co-ordination and the opportunity to share from experience were  wasted.
Although Government was the biggest spender on IT  in  South  Africa,  there
was no meaningful way to  leverage  the  spending  power  of  the  state  to
achieve economies of scale.

Departments  acted  autonomously  and  did  not  take   into   account   the
consideration that information about persons -  individual  or  legal  -  is
often shared amongst departments. The systems developed by  departments  did
not allow for the easy interchange of information.

One of the most important considerations in a government  IT  system  is  to
ensure that the system  conforms  to  the  security  standards  required  by
government and to prevent illegal access  to  information  and  systems.  We
daily face, through practical experience, the reality of individuals  trying
to illegally enter government information systems. The current Act does  not
allow Sita to address these problems in a streamlined and focused  way,  and
this has to be corrected.

An in-depth analysis of the structure, tasks and organisation  of  Sita  was
undertaken during the year 2000. The conclusion was that  the  structure  of
Sita had to be aligned, not only to meet the demands  of  its  clients,  but
also to address the shortcomings as identified in  the  Presidential  Review
Commission report.

Restructuring Sita without amending the current  Act  in  order  to  empower
Sita to achieve the objectives of the Presidential Review  Commission  would
be a waste of effort  and  taxpayer's  money.  Hence,  Sita  had  to  become
empowered to act firmly, while having  the  necessary  freedom,  to  achieve
what we identified as the ``IT House of Value''.

This involves the user  and  the  citizen's  convenience  through  increased
productivity at minimum cost and maximum efficiency  and  is  based  on  the
pillars of security and interoperability among  government  departments,  on
the elimination of duplication and on  achieving  economies  of  scale.  The
``IT House of Value'' has to be built on the foundation of an elite  core  -
and I use this consciously, an elite core - of skilled  performance-oriented
personnel.

The current Act calls for a forced approached in which departments  have  no
option, except when they would like to join and partake  in  Sita.  It  also
demarcates this Government IT domain as the monopolistic  playing  field  of
Sita with no alternatives for participating departments.

In the amending Bill we changed the approach  somewhat.  In  areas  such  as
transversal systems, systems that are common to a number  of  departments  -
and this includes Persal, which is the payment and HR system -  we  use  the
strong-arm technique, and departments must participate. They have no  choice
there. But with regard to specific systems and applications, supporting  the
core activities of departments,  we  allowed  departments  to  make  a  free
choice as to whether they would like to use Sita or not; or, and if they  do
not, to invite industry to supply such services.

Now  this  forces  Sita  to  pursue  excellent   performance,   to   attract
departments and, where necessary, to enter into strategic partnerships  with
industry in order to meet the requirements of Government. I will  come  back
to this issue in relation to the partnerships in the industry.

However, we also want Sita to do a  lot  more.  In  the  amending  Bill  the
agency has been mandated to become the single channel  for  the  procurement
of IT goods and services, as agreed to  with  the  National  Treasury.  This
applies irrespective  of  whether  the  goods  or  services  are  mandatory,
transversal, or optional departmental-specific applications and systems.

During this procurement process, Sita has to certify  systems  in  terms  of
interoperability; evaluate and certify the services or  goods  in  terms  of
compliance with the accepted security  standards  applicable  to  government
information services; and then, of course, Sita  has  to  identify  possible
duplications  and  combine  requirements  of  procurement  through  the  co-
ordination of all the procurement  and  acquisition  needs  of  departments.
This will  enable  Sita  to  negotiate  maximum  discounts  and  to  achieve
economies of scale through the leverage of the buying muscle of Government.
The  amending  Bill  also  allows  Sita  to  restructure,   reorganise   and
streamline its organisation and processes to  meet  the  challenges  of  the
next decade without neglecting the founder members  that  were  involved  in
the establishment of Sita.

On the point I raised earlier regarding strategic  partnerships  in  the  IT
sector, we  also  seek  to  broaden  the  base  of  economic  activity,  and
Government has a critical role in  the  development  and  expansion  of  the
capacity of emerging and existing black IT enterprises.

Hence, this amendment makes this possible, and Sita is not  small  in  terms
of turnover. It operates  in  a  dynamic  environment  in  which  technology
matures and even becomes obsolete in a matter of three  to  five  years.  In
view of this environment, Sita thus requires a dynamic company,  and  it  is
essential that the board of Sita be strengthened and expanded.

Hon members are aware that we have already put a new  board  in  place  that
brings different skills to the table under the chairpersonship of  Ms  Zodwa
Manase, who is in the box on my right. And, in the expansion  of  the  board
that the amendment allows, we want to further expand the skills base on  the
board.  This  can  be  accommodated  amongst  the   appointed   nonexecutive
directors.

To further ensure that Sita remains competitive, the Act  is  being  amended
to ensure that there is adequate consultation on the costs of its  services,
on the one hand, and that departments are  allowed  a  choice  in  terms  of
successful contracting at reasonable market rates, on the other  hand.  Like
any other provider of goods and services, Government must  continually  seek
ways to add value to the product it provides.

Sita is an agency that provides Government with a product,  a  product  that
enhances many services that  each  government  department  provides  to  its
clients - the people of South Africa. Hence, we would also like  to  have  a
situation in which members of the  public  can  access  public  services  24
hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year. That is what  we  are
moving towards.

We therefore place before this House  a  Bill  that  seeks  to  enhance  and
improve, that seeks to build on the lessons we have learnt, and  that  seeks
to increase efficiency, effectiveness and render state-of-the-art  services.
The adoption of this Bill by Parliament will herald the beginning of  a  new
era that will allow Sita to become a true partner  in  improving  Government
operations through enabling the technology of information systems.

It is fitting that  we  bring  this  amending  Bill  as  we  embark  on  and
participate in the World Summit on Sustainable Development, because the  use
of IT services by Government is a core  component  in  providing  integrated
and  effective  services,  services  that  seek  to  eliminate   waste   and
duplication, services that ensure that the different spheres  of  government
- different departments and institutions  of  Government  -  know  what  the
other is doing and share the information  and  technology  that  they  have.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Chairperson, hon  members,  the  DA  welcomes  any  attempt  to
improve service delivery to the public as these  amendments  today  seek  to
do.

The objectives of the Bill are twofold: firstly, the improvement of  service
delivery to the public through the provision of information technology -  ie
computers - information systems and related  services;  and,  secondly,  the
promotion of the efficiency of departments and organs of state  through  the
use of information technology.

What struck me most of all, given that  have  I  visited  a  lot  of  courts
lately, is what this could mean for the  justice  system,  and  particularly
victims of crime. I would like to elaborate by giving a  practical  example.
During the recent constituency period, I visited 15  courts  in  Gauteng  as
part of a fact-finding mission regarding child courts.

What I discovered  was  an  almost  complete  information  vacuum  in  which
magistrates and prosecutors try cases and attempt  to  convict  the  guilty.
This lack of  information  at  their  fingertips  is  often  the  difference
between a conviction and letting a rapists or murderer go free. In my  view,
computers can be used effectively to catch criminals.

Only in one court did all prosecutors have their own computers, but none  of
these were networked within the office and no prosecutor or  magistrate  had
access to the Internet. The implications of this are  enormous.  Apart  from
drowning in paper, prosecutors cannot research  cases  properly  since  many
courts do not have libraries and those that do need extensive  updating.  By
having access to the  Internet,  prosecutors  would  not  only  be  able  to
network with each other, but also be able  to  keep  up  to  date  with  the
latest judgments, a vital requirement of their work.

Another  way  in  which  the  Internet  could  be  of  great  assistance  to
prosecutors and magistrates is that they would be able to keep  up  to  date
with amended legislation. Currently,  it  takes  months  for  amendments  to
trickle down to the courts.

Lastly, by having basic equipment such  as  computers,  the  opportunity  to
link all courts throughout the country  becomes  a  real  possibility,  thus
allowing for a  protected  database  to  be  developed.  This  would  enable
prosecutors to establish if an accused person  applying  for  bail  has  had
similar or other charges against him or her in another part of the  country.
This  would  empower  prosecutors  with  facts  when   dealing   with   bail
applications that could mean the difference between life and death.

We know from example that lack of  such  information  could  result  in  the
court granting bail, which could lead to crimes being  committed  while  the
accused is out on bail. This has happened on several occasions recently.

I trust that the criminal justice cluster  will  be  the  first  to  receive
attention in respect of this  Bill.  I  cannot  overemphasise  the  lack  of
information in courts which, to my mind, allows the  guilty  to  walk  free.
Information is power, and nowhere is it needed more than in the courts.

While the DA  welcomes  any  legislation  that  talks  about  improving  the
efficiency of Government's service delivery, a  few  questions  need  to  be
raised with the  hon  Minister.  Firstly,  will  the  Department  of  Public
Servive and Administration measure Sita's effectiveness and  performance  in
order to  demonstrate  that  there  actually  has  been  an  improvement  in
efficiency and financial savings; if so, how will they  do  this?  Secondly,
does Sita have a business plan or strategy to implement  the  objectives  of
this Act? Thirdly, does  Sita  currently  have  the  capacity  to  meet  the
objectives of this Act?

The DA supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr  U  ROOPNARAIN:  Chairperson,  members  of  this  honourable  House,  the
amendments we are debating today will largely  facilitate  Sita's  operation
which is about implementing a regulatory ideal or  a  new  revised  business
model. There is no doubt that digital technology is the dynamo  that  drives
our economy.

In the two or three minutes that are left to speak  I  will  just  give  hon
members a  capsule  commentary  on  the  Bill.  Initially,  the  nature  and
contours of the Bill  demonstrated  a  web  of  intricate  ambiguities.  For
example, the  IFP  had  deep  reservations  about  the  clause  ``wide  area
network'' and about certain definitions, such as  that  for  ``agency''  and
``organ  of  state.''  These  were  really   confusing   and   contradictory
expressions.

The term and foci of ``wide area network'' seemed to insinuate the  creation
of a backbone for the third national operator, and, in  addition,  this  was
not aligned  with  the  Telecommunications  Act.  Another  problem  was  the
insufficient amount of consultation with affected entities like  Telkom  and
Transtel. The IFP also raised concerns  about  pre-existing  relations  with
the various IT vendors and the  repercussions  after  these  amendments  are
implemented.

Another problem was Sita having a multiplicity of  roles,  such  as  player,
procurer, broker and referee. This was cold comfort to us as members of  the
committee. Today we have a revised Bill, a Bill that is clear,  without  any
superfluous, contradictory or confusing expressions.

The Bill also  emphasises  Sita's  role  in  using  IT  to  improve  service
delivery through increasing productivity, guides  Sita's  operation  in  the
deployment of IT applications and in eliminating IT duplication.  In  short,
it is a good Bill.

The IFP will support all efforts to ensure that Government  gets  value  for
money  out  of  IT  procurement.  Furthermore,  we  believe  that  developed
economies  should  not  dominate  in  every  category  of  information   and
communication technology, but that South  Africa  needs  to  get  to  centre
stage and become part of this technological revolution.

In closing, I just want to say that it would  be  churlish  not  to  support
this Bill. The IFP supports the Bill.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Chairperson, in light of the New NP's commitment  to
being a partner in the process of creating a better  South  Africa  for  all
its people, the New NP welcomes the  Government's  rationale  of  developing
Sita as an ``IT House of Value''.

The purpose of this Bill is to provide  a  further  building  block  in  the
effort to bring about meaningful changes that are aimed at improved  service
delivery to the public  by  providing  information  technology,  information
systems and  its  related  services  that  require  a  sustained  system  to
departments and organs of state within a secured environment.

In die Departement van die  Staatsdiens  en  Administrasie  se  voortdurende
strewe na effektiwiteit binne die departement,  maak  die  wysiging  in  die
wetsontwerp voorsiening vir  die  uitbreiding  en  versekering  van  hierdie
proses. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In the Department of Public Service and Administration's constant  striving
to bring about efficiency in the  department,  the  amendment  in  the  Bill
makes provision for the extension and assurance of this process.]

It is true that there were very  specific  concerns  raised  by  Telkom  and
Transtel with regard to the delivery of certain services  by  Sita.  It  is,
however,  noteworthy  to  mention  that  these  concerns   were   adequately
addressed by the director-general and his legal team. This  proves  the  New
NP's policy that problems  only  get  solved  adequately  when  one  engages
constructively, rather than always adopting a stance of fight back like  the
DP usually does, as cool heads and  open  minds  usually  turn  a  perceived
problem into a golden opportunity. [Interjections.]

We believe that the amendments provided for by  this  Bill  will  strengthen
Sita's efforts to provide information  technology  and  information  systems
training  aimed  at  alleviating  information  technology  skills  shortages
within Government.

The provision of effective IT resource management will  provide  and  manage
application  software  development  and  maintenance  services.   Technical,
functional and business advice to departments must  seek  to  provide  value
for money to departments and convenience to citizens. Departments are  still
greatly dependent on contractors, whereas Sita  should  be  responsible  for
providing IT technology and information systems to management services.

The New NP  is  of  the  opinion  that  this  Bill  will  enable  government
departments, with the help of Sita, to provide an integrated,  accurate  and
up-to-date population register in the future;  provide  educational  records
linked to the population register;  provide  access  to  Sars  tax  systems;
provide  biometrics  integrated  with  the  Deeds   Register,   unemployment
records, health records for prompt  feedback  on  eligibility  and  ease  of
pension payments; and, furthermore, provide biometrics integrated  with  the
population register and  links  to  Justice,  the  police  and  Correctional
Services, to name but a few. Therefore, the New  NP  has  no  hesitation  in
supporting this Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Chairperson, the State Information  Technology  Agency  is  a
company established in 1999 by  the  Sita  Act,  Act  88  of  1998.  It  was
established to provide IT and IS services  and  other  related  services  to
departments that chose to avail themselves of its services.

It has since been found that the agency has actually functioned  efficiently
and  that  the  participating  departments   have   benefited   from   their
association with Sita. They stick out like a sore thumb.

The  general  demand  for  greater  efficiency   in   the   functioning   of
nonparticipating departments has necessitated the extension of the field  of
involvement of Sita in those departments and in other organs of  state,  and
for Sita to serve as  an  intermediary  in  these  fields,  particularly  in
respect of procurement. Certain technical corrections have also to  be  made
to the original Act.

The UDM believes that Sita has proved itself capable  of  greatly  improving
service delivery in departments, and therefore supports  the  amending  Bill
without reservation or further comments on its provisions.

However, I would like to comment on the cautious processing of this Bill  by
members of the committee -  across  party  lines  -  and  the  diligent  and
professional manner in which the chairman of the committee,  hon  member  Mr
John Gomomo, led the committee through the intricacies of the provisions  of
this Bill. This was highly commendable. So hon member Mr Moss can  see  that
we do not only criticise where necessary; we speak  whether  he  listens  or
not.

Having had one's concerns addressed and  one's  questions  answered  in  the
committee by ever-ready officials, some of whom are sitting in the  box,  it
has been rendered superfluous for me to ramble on  ad  nauseam  about  every
detail. Therefore, the UDM supports the amending Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon members, the amendments in this Bill for  the
purpose of increased performance in service  delivery  by  Sita  necessitate
that  Government's  information  systems  be  effectively  aligned.   Sita's
primary  role  is  to  ensure  that  Government's   information   technology
functions at optimum standards.

The complexity of  multiple  networks  that  are  not  properly  aligned  to
Government  business  can  create   insecurity   and   unpredictability   in
information systems operations. It is especially essential for  the  process
of co-operative government to have information systems in  which  the  lines
of communications are efficiently aligned.

The other area of importance is the  greater  security  needed  in  managing
information systems. The  increasing  use  of  technology  demands  that  we
acquire the best systems to protect our  national  security.  If  these  are
some of the information areas Sita is called on to improve, then  this  Bill
will help to provide the framework to achieve these objectives.

The ACDP therefore supports this Bill without reservation.

Mr P J GOMOMO: Chairperson, the main objectives of this  Bill  is  to  lower
costs, increase productivity and enhance service delivery to the  public  in
such a way that  there  is  security  of  information  and  the  absence  of
duplication, all to ensure the  realisation  of  Government's  ``Information
Technology House of Value''.

The desirability of this arises from the fact that the Sita Act, which  this
honourable House passed in 1998 in its current form, does  not  provide  for
the realisation of the objectives intended in terms of this Bill.  It  is  a
fitting observation to say that this Bill is  a  technical  intervention  in
order to provide for an environment conducive to the realisation of a  grand
plan, which this House conceptualised four years  ago  when  it  passed  the
Sita Act.

In this current democratic political dispensation there is always  the  need
for transparency and yet there is also a need for  accountability,  and  the
key to that is that the communication network should be so organised  as  to
achieve maximum output with reasonable costs. Information  technology  is  a
useful tool in the realisation of our political mandate. This  amendment  to
the Sita Act is there to sharpen this tool.

The Portfolio Committee on Public Service  and  Administration  visited  the
Sita site in April this year, and that visit  demonstrated  to  me  and  the
committee the fact that Sita is an institution that  is  well  resourced  to
perform within expectations. I regard the  intervention  in  terms  of  this
Bill as an important contribution.

Our own experience will also remind us of the fact that the  duplication  we
have in dealing with the  information  technology  needs  of  Government  is
unfortunate and amounts to unaccountable  expenditure.  There  is  no  doubt
that the provision of this Bill will alleviate all this. It is also a value-
adding exercise to have the  Bill  before  us  as  it  will  give  Sita  the
function of providing the  necessary  service  for  government-to-government
communication, without the involvement of other parties.

In dealing  with  this  Bill,  the  portfolio  committee  engaged  with  the
original draft by the Department of Public Service and Administration  in  a
manner that showed a commitment to  insisting  on  the  correctness  of  the
actions of the executive. There was robust debate, and  all  efforts  seemed
to want to get us to come out with a workable piece of legislation of  which
we could all be proud.

To this end I  want  to  thank  all  members  of  the  committee  for  their
contribution. I must say that they are wonderful people. Even  when  we  had
to finalise our report on this Bill, we adopted it as  a  committee  without
dissension and expected a smooth debate in this House, as has been the  case
today.

I also want to commend Transnet and Telkom  for  their  concerns  about  the
Bill in terms of the way it was  originally  drafted,  particularly  because
they did not keep quiet but came forward  to  raise  issues  that  concerned
them. Some  of  them  received  only  short  notice  to  appear  before  the
committee and yet they performed exceedingly well.

The fact that the final Bill, which we are debating  today,  took  on  board
the issues they raised through the necessary amendment of the original  Bill
is indicative of the reality that the ANC is not paying lip service when  we
talk about a consultative legislation process, because we mean that  we  may
be influenced and that people should come forward.

Finally,  I  want  to  salute  the  Department   of   Public   Service   and
Administration for their professionalism in dealing  with  this  Bill,  and,
more so, for the manner in which they  proved  responsive  to  the  call  of
democratic governance. I must say that after the  department  held  meetings
with Transnet and Telkom to clarify areas of potential conflict  with  their
respective mandates, the work of the committee was made simpler as we  could
not have just proceeded with the Bill as if ignoring the concerns raised  by
those two institutions. The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 16:43.
