The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  We  shall  now
proceed to Questions as per the Order Paper.

Firstly, I take this opportunity to welcome the hon Deputy President to  the
House. Secondly, I have just been informed that there is a  delegation  from
the Czech Republic in the gallery. I also take this opportunity  to  welcome
them. They are from the senate of the Czech Republic. [Applause.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter,  ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem dat -


  (1) die Nuwe NP die raadslede gelukwens wat reeds die besluit geneem  het
       om -


       (a)  uit die ``fight back''-milieu van selfvernietiging  van  die  DA
           weg te breek;


       (b)  deel van die oplossing in Suid-Afrika te word; en


       (c)  nie bloot op die kantlyn te staan en kritiseer, en politiek  vir
           'n uitgesoekte elitistiese groep in die media te pleeg nie;


  (2) daar egter nog raadslede met  integriteit  is  wat  besig  is  om  te
       konsulteer en 'n besluit te neem;


  (3) die Nuwe NP hulle sterkte toewens en hoop om hulle binnekort  in  die
       hoofstroom van die Suid-Afrikaanse politiek te verwelkom; en


  (4) dit aangenaam is  om  in  hierdie  Raad  aan  te  kondig  dat  genoeg
       raadslede vandag in Stellenbosch Munisipaliteit, anders as  wat  Tony
       Leon laas week aangekondig het, na die Nuwe NP oorgestap het  en  van
       die DA bevry is.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting  of
the Council I shall move:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) the New NP congratulates the councillors who have already  taken  the
       decision to -


       (a)  break  away  from  the  DA's  ``fight  back''  milieu  of  self-
           destruction;


       (b)  become part of the solution in South Africa; and


       (c)  not merely stand on the sidelines, criticising,  and  engage  in
           politics for a select elitist group in the media;
  (2) there are some councillors with integrity left who are consulting and
       making a decision;


  (3) the New NP wishes  them  well  and  hopes  to  welcome  them  to  the
       mainstream of South African politics soon; and


  (4) it is a pleasure to announce in this Chamber that enough  councillors
       crossed  the  floor  to  the  New  NP  today  in   the   Stellenbosch
       Municipality and have been set free from the  DA,  in  contrast  with
       what Tony Leon announced last week,

[Applause.]]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  of
this Council, I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that 1 409 DA councillors were elected in 2000 and that 612  of
       them were members of the  New  NP,  nominated  by  Mr  Marthinus  van
       Schalkwyk;


  (2) further notes with pleasure that only 228 of these  councillors  have
       turned their backs on the voters and rejected their mandate; and


  (3) expresses the hope that the rest of the councillors will  resist  the
       temptation of joining the ANC-New NP alliance ... [Interjections.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I rise on a  point  of  order.  It  is  not
parliamentary for a member to  quote  unconfirmed  figures  in  this  House.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon member,  we
do not know whether or not those figures have been confirmed, because we  do
not have the statistics here. Please continue, Mr Lever.

Mr L G LEVER: Thank you, Chairperson.


  (3) ... in return for  jobs  and  perks,  and  that  they  will  continue
       providing efficient and good government where the DA is in power, and
       principled and effective opposition where it is not.

               DEMORALISING MESSAGES OF THE LOVE LIFE CAMPAIGN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That this prestigious Council -


  (1) expresses its shock and dismay at the demoralising  messages  of  the
       Love Life campaign that are plastered on billboards, and that are  in
       taxis  and  the  printed  media,  especially  in  the  residences  of
       marginalised communities;


  (2) notes that while the sports programmes of the Love Life campaign  are
       truly  commendable,  its  messages  are  debasing,  shocking  and  in
       conflict with the tutorial and moral guidance that young  people  are
       seeking;


  (3) further notes that examples of such negative messages are as follows:


       ``Sex is Sex: Show me the money.''
       ``I only do it skin-to-skin.''
       ``I wanted to wait, but Abram was inside me before I could say no.'';


  (4) endorses the Love Life campaign for victims of HIV/Aids;


  (5) notes that this House desires to see the Love Life campaign  use  its
       extensive resources more on abstinence and  education  on  sexuality,
       than on its misleading and lewd messages; and


  (6) notes that we must let the people know and  hear  our  objections  to
       such bad ideas that are against our  true  African  culture  on  such
       matters.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Is  there  any
objection to the motion? Yes, there is. In the light of the  objection,  the
motion may not be proceeded with. The motion without notice  will  become  a
notice of motion.

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) sy dank uitspreek teenoor die SAPD in die Wes-Kaap wat daarin geslaag
       het om die vertroue van die publiek in  dié  diens  te  herstel  deur
       gisteraand die laaste van die drie lede van Pagad  wat  in  September
       ontsnap het, aan te keer; en


  (2) sy hoop uitspreek dat -


       (a)  daar eerder op hierdie suksesse as op nalatigheid gebou sal word
           ten einde 'n veilige en wetsgehoorsame omgewing vir  alle  Suid-
           Afrikaners te skep; en


       (b)  dat geen toleransie vir misdaad 'n werklikheid  in  die  praktyk
           sal word.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its gratitude to the SAPS in the Western Cape for regaining
       the public's trust in this service by last night arresting  the  last
       of the three Pagad members who escaped in September; and


  (2) expresses the hope that -


       (a)  these successes rather than negligence  would  be  built  on  in
           order to create a safe and law-abiding environment for all South
           Africans; and


       (b)  in practice zero tolerance for crime will become a reality.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       die ywer wat aan die dag gelê is  om  hierdie  eksamen  sonder  enige

       dit sal voortduur;


  (3) sy dank teenoor die ouers uitspreek vir die bystand, betrokkenheid en

  (4) besef dat die sukses van Suid-Afrika by die opvoeding  van  ons  jeug
       begin; en


  (5) al die provinsies uitdaag om hierdie jaar  te  probeer  om  beter  te
       doen, en om die voorbeeld wat die Noord-Kaap verlede jaar gestel  het
       toe sy matriekuitslae die beste in die land was, na te volg.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

  PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION OF ROAD
                       TRAFFIC OFFENCES AMENDMENT BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat wetsontwerp Nr 42 van 2002, naamlik  ``Administrative
       Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Amendment Bill''  môre  in  die
       Nasionale Vergadering gedebatteer word;


  (2) met kommer kennis neem dat die taal van die amptelike  vertaling  van
       die wetsontwerp nie dieselfde is as die amptelike vertaling  van  die
       Hoofwet wat die Parlement in 1998 goedgekeur het nie;


  (3) voorts met kommer kennis neem dat die uitwerking hiervan sal wees dat
       die Hoofwet, soos gewysig, net in een taal bly voortbestaan; en


  (4) verder van mening is dat dit nie in die gees  van  die  Grondwet  van
       Suid-Afrika is nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that  Bill  No  42  of  2002,  namely  the  Administrative
       Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Bill will  be  debated  in  the
       National Assembly tomorrow;


  (2) takes note with concern that the language of the official translation
       of the Bill is not the  same  as  the  official  translation  of  the
       principal Act which Parliament approved in 1998;


  (3) furthermore notes with concern that the consequence of this  will  be
       that the principal Act, as amended, will only continue  to  exist  in
       one language; and


  (4) is further of the opinion that this is  not  in  the  spirit  of  the
       Constitution of South Africa.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Are  we  not
anticipating a Bill which is to go before Parliament tomorrow,  even  though
it is not in this Chamber? I just want to check whether it  is  correct  for
us to move in advance, before a Bill is actually debated in the House.

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I would imagine that it would not be correct  for
the Council to do so, and that it would be appropriate then to  register  an
objection to the motion, or to have the motion withdrawn.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! For the  sake  of  principle  and
clarity, could we reserve the decision on this motion until we are clear  on
this matter and have checked whether we  can  anticipate  the  merits  of  a
debate that is still to go before Parliament, even though it is  in  another
House?

            AWARD TO MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DR DLAMINI-ZUMA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pride that the Minister of Foreign Affairs,  Dr  Nkosazana
       Dlamini-Zuma,  has  been  selected  to  receive  an  award   by   the
       International Women's Forum;
  (2) further notes that this honour is in recognition  of  her  leadership
       qualities and the contribution she has made to public office; and


  (3) congratulates the Minister on her achievement.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        CORPORATE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Economic and
                          Foreign Affairs thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson and hon members,  the
amendments before us today may be small, but they herald a new  era  in  the
way that the Companies Office operates.

In an effort to improve service delivery, my department has amalgamated  the
old Companies and Close Corporations Registration Offices  and  the  Patents
and Trade Marks Registration Offices into a single office to now become  the
Companies and Intellectual Property Registration Office,  Cipro  for  short.
That was in the year 2001.

In April of this year, and  in  consultation  with  the  National  Treasury,
Cipro was converted into a trading entity within  the  Department  of  Trade
and Industry, but  still  under  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act.  The
trading entity status was granted to Cipro on  condition  that  it  recovers
its operational costs from funds generated for services rendered by it.

Cipro has therefore two years from the passing of this  legislation  to  set
up structures that will enable it to collect  moneys  for  the  services  it
renders to its various stakeholders and clients.

The first amendment by  this  Bill  to  the  Companies  Act  and  the  Close
Corporations Act will make this possible. It will also place  the  Registrar
of Companies in a position  to  apply  modern  and  market-related  ways  of
payment, which will also benefit the public at large.

The second very important matter addressed  by  the  amending  Bill  is  the
reintroduction of annual returns, both by companies and close  corporations.
As members may know, annual returns by companies  were  abolished  in  1986.
This was due to the lack of capacity within the department at  the  time  to
deal with them. The result thereof was  that  the  database  in  respect  of
corporate entities suffered drastically because of the lack of integrity  of
the information contained therein.

Reliable information about South African business  entities  has  become  of
utmost importance to South African and foreign investors, and  also  to  our
own incentive drive as a department. Furthermore,  many  other  stakeholders
rely on this information, starting from our courts to  the  banking  sector,
the SA Revenue Service, the police, tender  boards,  all  state  departments
from  national  down  to  local  government,  the   legal   and   accounting
professions, to mention but a few.

Although a nominal prescribed fee will be charged  on  companies  and  close
corporations once a year upon lodgment of the annual  return,  the  benefits
for the companies, the business environment  and  potential  investors  will
far outweigh the negative sentiment which is normally  associated  with  any
payment of fees. Furthermore, this amending  Bill  provides  for  two  other
less important amendments. One deals with the prescribed fee and  the  other
relates to applications for name reservations.

Hon members will appreciate that the intentions and objectives of this  Bill
are to benefit the South African  economy  and  its  business  community  in
general, as well as to  ensure  good  corporate  governance  and  electronic
commerce in the long run. So I ask all  members  to  support  this  amending
Bill. [Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, when the United States  company  Enron  collapsed
not so long ago,  wiping  out  some  $9  billion  of  US  investors'  money,
including money that belonged to pensioners and  pension  funds,  it  became
clear that, not only in a huge economy such as that of the United States  of
America but also in economies all over the world, it was necessary to  begin
looking at our corporate governance laws to  start  regulating  the  way  in
which companies do business, to start regulating the way in which  companies
look after their shareholders and investors and,  in  many  instances,  look
after the hard-earned savings of working people who have  left  their  money
in pension funds.

With this in mind - and, I think, South Africa may have been ahead  of  many
other countries in this - the Department of Trade and Industry already  some
time ago started modernising the Companies Office so that this office  would
begin to do the corporate governance things that were required in  order  to
ensure that we have a Companies Office that has sufficient integrity.

One of the things that was done - and members would recall that we had  some
discussion and debate about this  some  time  ago  -  was  to  introduce  an
electronic format through which the Companies Office would be able to  start
taking registrations for names, name applications and so forth.

One of the biggest problems  with  that  was  how  one  collects  fees.  Hon
members would remember that in the old  days  when  one  wanted  to  form  a
company, one would fill in all the company forms, attach a revenue stamp  to
the top of the document - in fact, that is still being done at the moment  -
and lodge that in the Companies Office. That revenue stamp would  reflect  a
payment to the state.

Now what was happening was  that  the  Treasury,  as  the  agency  that  was
collecting the money, had to utilise that money appropriately  in  order  to
make sure that  the  Companies  Office  ran.  Quite  a  huge  administrative
backlog and nightmare were taking place there.

One of the biggest problems that had to be faced was that one could not  run
a modern, First  World,  world-class  Companies  Office  without  sufficient
resources; without a sufficient amount of money being  spent  on  electronic
data systems, on the  hardware,  on  the  software,  without  marketing  and
advertising the systems effectively; and without making  sure  that  agents,
lawyers and accountants who were there, knew how to use the system,  use  it
well and without making sure it was well maintained.

Some time ago a decision was  taken  that  the  Companies  Office  would  be
converted  into  a  new  organisation  called  Cipro  -  the  Companies  and
Intellectual Property  Registration  Office.  As  the  Deputy  Minister  has
indicated, that merger has necessitated a whole lot of things happening.

One of these things is to ensure that Cipro becomes a self-sustaining, self-
funded institution. With that, some amendments to  the  Companies  Act  were
required to allow them to move away from  the  system  of  collecting  money
through revenue stamps and to start using other systems  of  fee  collection
for the work they do. This law gives them the power to do this.

The law also places the expectation on state institutions to  become  viable
and efficient institutions, whether they be the Companies  Office,  Transnet
or Telkom. We do not want to throw away good  taxpayer's  money  on  systems
that are old, obsolete, sometimes very costly and running at a loss.

One of things that will start happening after this Bill is passed,  is  that
Cipro will start looking at its own accounting systems and making sure  that
it starts funding itself to run at a profit. At some point Cipro will  start
receiving little or no money from Government in order to  do  its  work.  It
will have to raise  its  own  money  through  fees  that  are  already  well
generated into the Treasury in order to do its work.

As the  Deputy  Minister  has  mentioned,  there  is  the  question  of  the
integrity of  our  database  -  of  our  Companies  and  Close  Corporations
Registration  Offices'  database.  At  the  moment  we  have  thousands   of
companies that are registered on our database at the  Companies  Office.  We
do not know if they are operational at all. Some of them are  dormant;  some
have not opened their doors or done business for  a  long  time;  some  have
never submitted returns to the Receiver of Revenue, and so forth, but  those
names are there. Some of us have companies like that. One may have formed  a
company many years  ago  and  decided  not  to  do  anything  with  it.  The
registration information of that company is then just lying in the  database
of the Companies Registration Office.

After this  Bill  is  passed,  it  is  going  to  become  necessary  -  and,
Chairperson, you will know what I am talking about because you are a  lawyer
- for all companies to submit an annual return to indicate whether they  are
still trading, what their status is and  whether  the  particulars  of  that
company are the same. This  is  not  only  the  database  of  the  Companies
Office, but also potential investors, shareholders and all sorts  of  people
who need information, particularly creditors. If  one  is  going  to  borrow
money from a bank in the name of one's company, the bank would  surely  want
to know whether, within the previous year,  all  the  information  that  the
Companies Office has on one is true and correct.

It is very important that we modernise our Companies Office's  database  and
also ensure that the integrity of the database is protected. In that way  we
will  be  creating  a  better  regulatory  business  environment  in   which
companies can do business in this  country,  and  in  which  foreigners  and
foreign investors, etc, can  believe  that  when  they  see  information  on
Government information systems that that information is accurate,  true  and
valid.

I see that my time has run out, Chair of Chairs. The Deputy Chairperson  has
suddenly changed gender. It is now the Chair of  Chairs.  In  conclusion,  I
just wanted to say that this is part of a long road. One of the things  that
the department has  done  is  to  take  a  decision  to  revamp  the  entire
Companies Act. It is going to be necessary very soon to rewrite  the  entire
Companies Act so that it begins taking into  account  all  the  issues  that
modern economies require companies to do. I am told that  that  process  has
begun. The Deputy Minister will reply to that when she speaks. In  terms  of
that process, structures are being set in place to start  redrafting  a  new
Companies Act which we should expect in the next year or two.

With these few words, I want to say that we should ask the House to  endorse
this Bill fully. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Agb Voorsitter, agb Adjunk-Minister  Hendricks  en  kollegas,
reeds gedurende verlede jaar is die registrasiekantore  vir  maatskappye  en
beslote korporasies, asook dié vir  patente  en  handelsmerke,  waarvan  die
gesamentlike dienstefooie in die vorige twee jaar ongeveer R70 miljoen  rand
beloop het, in 'n enkele kantoor saamgevoeg. Die  kantoor  staan  bekend  as
die Registrasiekantoor vir Maatskappye  en  Intellektuele  Eiendom,  oftewel
Cipro, die akroniem vir Companies and Intellectual  Properties  Registration
Office. Die Nasionale Tesourie het dan ook toestemming verleen dat Cipro  in
'n handeldrywende liggaam binne die  Departement  van  Handel  en  Nywerheid
omskep word, wat kragtens  die  Wet  op  Openbare  Finansiële  Bestuur  1999
opereer, op  voorwaarde  dat  sy  bedryfskoste  binne  twee  jaar  deur  die
saamgestelde kantore se  dienstefooie  gedek  word.  Hierdie  fooie  is  die
afgelope 12 jaar nie aangepas nie, aangesien die onderskeie kantore  nie  in
staat was om die dienslewering te verbeter nie, en 'n  opwaartse  aanpassing
van die fooie as onvanpas beskou is.

Met die volle rekenarisering van Cipro wat  tans  onderneem  word,  kan  die
fooie nou markverwant aangepas word. Tot  op  hede  is  die  fooie  van  die
onderskeie kantore betaal met  behulp  van  inkomsteseëls  op  dokumente  en
aansoekvorms en is die inkomste  in  die  Nasionale  Inkomstefonds  gestort.
Hierdie wysigingswet maak dit moontlik dat Cipro, met  die  toestemming  van
die Tesourie en die Suid-Afrikaanse Inkomstediens, sy fooie  regstreeks  vir
eie rekening kan invorder.

Die herinstelling van jaarlikse opgawes deur maatskappye, en die  instelling
daarvan sover dit die beslote korporasies betref, is 'n  verdere  belangrike
uitvloeisel van hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp. Wat hierdie aspek betref,  sou
daar in die toekoms ook gekyk kan word na die  moontlikheid  dat  'n  enkele
jaarlikse opgawevorm vir die gesamentlike  gebruik  deur  Cipro  en  die  SA
Inkomstediens  in  gebruik  gestel  word.  Dit  kan  en   sal   'n   verdere
modernisering van stelsels tot gevolg  hê,  wat  ook  daartoe  sal  lei  dat
administrasie-prosedures en papierwerk vir veral  kleiner  ondernemings  wat
reeds swaar onder onproduktiewe statutêre maatreëls ly,  radikaal  verminder
word. Hoewel daar nie in die wetsontwerp hiervoor  voorsiening  gemaak  word
nie, kan gerus gekyk word na verdere  wetswysigings  wat  dit  moontlik  sal
maak en die geleidelike implementering daarvan.

Voorsitter, dit wat deur hierdie  wysigingswetsontwerp  beoog  word,  is  'n
navolging van 'n wêreldwye neiging wat onder meer ook  daarop  gerig  is  om
dienslewering te verbeter, om deursigtigheid deur middel van 'n databank  te
bevorder en om bedrog tot 'n groot mate hok te slaan.

Die Nuwe NP steun die  wetsontwerp.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Dr  E  A  CONROY:  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister  Hendricks  and
colleagues, the registration offices for companies and  close  corporations,
as well as the office for patents  and  trade  marks,  of  which  the  joint
service fees amounted to R70 million in the previous  two  years,  had  been
amalgamated into one office. The office is known as Cipro,  an  acronym  for
Companies and Intellectual  Properties  Registration  Office.  The  National
Treasury gave permission to Cipro to be changed into a trading  body  within
the department of Trade and Industry, which will operate  in  terms  of  the
Public Finance Management Act of 1999, provided that its running costs  will
be covered within two years by the joint offices' service fees.  These  fees
have not been adjusted over  the  past  12  years,  because  the  respective
offices have not been able to  improve  the  delivery  of  service,  and  an
upward adjustment of fees was regarded as being improper.

With the full computerisation of Cipro which is currently being  undertaken,
the fees can now be adjusted according to market-related standards. To  date
the fees of the respective offices were paid by means of revenue  stamps  on
documents and application forms and  the  revenue  was  deposited  into  the
National Revenue Fund. This amending Bill allows Cipro, with the  permission
of the National Treasury and the South African Revenue Service,  to  collect
fees directly for its own account.

The reinstatement of annual statements by  companies,  and  the  instituting
thereof as far as closed corporations are concerned,  is  a  very  important
result flowing from this amending Bill. As far as this aspect is  concerned,
in future one might even consider  the  possibility  that  a  single  annual
statement form may be put into operation for joint use by Cipro and  the  SA
Revenue Service. This can and will  lead  to  even  further  modernising  of
systems, which in  turn  will  lead  to  radically  reducing  administrative
procedures  and  paper  work  for  smaller  companies,  which  are   already
suffering because of unproductive statutory measures. Although no  provision
is made for this in the Bill, further amendments  to  the  Act,  which  will
make this possible, may be considered.

Chairperson, what is envisaged by this amending Bill  is  in  step  with  an
international trend,  which,  among  others,  is  also  aimed  at  improving
service delivery by promoting transparency by means of a  databank,  and  to
keep fraud at bay to a large extent.

The New NP supports this Bill. [Applause.]]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, hon members, the  Corporate
Laws Amendment Bill is an essential Bill  as  it  seeks  to  amalgamate  the
Companies and Close Corporations Registration Office  and  the  Patents  and
Trade Marks Registration Office into a single  office  called  Cipro  -  the
Companies and Intellectual Property Registration Office.

With effect from 1 April 2002, Cipro has, with the approval of the  National
Treasury, been converted into a trading entity within the  department  under
the Public Finance Management Act. This approval was  granted  on  condition
that Cipro recovers its operational costs within the  next  two  years  from
funds generated for services rendered.

Over the past couple of years the funds generated by the two offices,  which
now comprise Cipro, were approximately R70 million, as was said.

Dit is belangrik om te noem dat dit nie die voorneme  is  om  wins  te  maak
nie, maar om koste vir die werksaamhede te verhaal. Behalwe  vir  'n  10-15%
buffer om Cipro deur te haal na die volgende  finansiële  jaar,  die  bedrag
sal in elk geval goedgekeur word deur die nasionale tesourie,  moet  surplus
geld in terme van die relevante wetgewing aan die einde van finansiële  jaar
teruggaan  na  die  Nasionale  Inkomste  Fonds.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[It is also important to mention that it is not  the  intention  to  make  a
profit, but to recover the costs spent on  the  activities.  Surplus  money,
apart from a 10-15% buffer to see Cipro through to the next financial  year,
the amount will in any event be approved by the National Treasury,  must  in
terms if the relevant legislation return to the National Income Fund at  the
end of the financial year.]

The Bill further seeks to change the  manner  of  payment  for  the  service
rendered by Cipro. This will enable Cipro to perform its role and  function,
and to introduce e-commerce in the lodgment of documents and the  disclosure
of  corporate  information.  Obviously  these  measures  will  enhance  both
efficiency and modernisation of registration  procedures  in  the  corporate
sector. Investors, both domestic and foreign,  will  be  better  served  and
serviced.

Ons wil dus vir Cipro sterkte toewens met die taak vorentoe, en vertrou  dat
gewerk sal word  vir  die  beswil  van  alle  ondernemings  in  Suid-Afrika.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[We thus want to wish Cipro well with the task ahead and trust that it  will
work for the betterment of all enterprises in South Africa.]

The Bill further seeks to  address  an  aspect  of  concern,  which  is  the
unsatisfactory compliance with the requirements of  the  Companies  Act  and
the Close Corporations Act regarding disclosure of certain information.  The
introduction of an annual return will greatly benefit the integrity  of  the
South  African  registry's  database  on  registered  companies  and   close
corporations. This will  further  facilitate  corporate  accountability  and
good corporate government.

If Cipro is to  be  a  national  public  entity  under  the  Public  Finance
Management Act, Cipro itself will  have  tight  governance  obligations  and
accountability arrangements in  terms  of  the  PFMA.  It  is  important  to
mention that there is no criminal penalty for noncompliance with the  annual
return requirement. The ultimate sanction  will  be  deregistration  of  the
entity if it has for more than six months failed to lodge the return.

Twee  verdere  minder  belangrike  wysigings  word  ook  voorgestel  in  die
konsepwysigingswetsontwerp. Klousule 62 van die Wet op Maatskappye skryf  'n
tarief  voor  vir  die  daarstelling  van  'n  goedgekeurde   kapitaal   van
maatskappye. Daar word voorgestel dat hierdie tarief  bepaal  word  deur  'n
regulasie van die Minister van Handel en Nywerheid, soos dit  in  die  geval
is met ander voorgeskrewe tariewe. Daar is geen rede hoekom  hierdie  tarief
voorgeskryf moet word in  wetgewing  nie,  en  dit  dra  nie  by  tot  goeie
administrasie nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Two further less important  amendments  are  also  proposed  in  the  draft
amendment bill. Clause 62 of the Companies Act prescribes a tariff  for  the
creation of an approved capital of all  companies.  It  is  prescribed  that
this tariff be determined by a regulation  of  the  Minister  of  Trade  and
Industry, as is the case with all other  prescribed  tariffs.  There  is  no
reason why this tariff must be prescribed in legislation, and this does  not
contribute to good administration.]

The second amendment relates  to  applications  for  name  reservations.  To
assist in applications for names, Cipro has put a sophisticated name  search
facility on the Web where potential business people  can  do  a  very  user-
friendly name search, free of charge, prior to lodgment of  an  application.
The electronic name reservation system to be introduced nationally has  been
developed in such a way that it automatically gives the applicant  a  search
result on the proposed names, prior to allowing the applicant to  lodge  the
application. The presearch and its result are, in effect,  free  of  charge,
and it is up to the applicant to make an informed decision  when  eventually
lodging the application. Only at this point does the prescribed fee  becomes
payable.

It is proposed that the DP and the DA support the Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam  Chair,  I  thank  the  hon
members and the chairperson of the  committee,  Mr  Moosa,  for  championing
this Bill throughout and for coming up with the amendment  that  has  helped
companies to avoid at least some of the punitive measures  if  they  do  not
provide annual returns. I would also like to thank  the  other  members  who
participated in this debate.

Indeed, Mr Moosa was correct when he spoke not only about these  amendments,
but also a whole reform process of trying to change the  Companies  Act  and
bring it in line with not only the present economy, but  also  international
best standards.

The project is far advanced. A project leader has been identified,  as  have
the themes in terms of  which  the  reform  is  going  to  take  place.  The
department has identified interns, particularly African women, both  lawyers
and masters students, whom we want to expose to this field  of  law,  as  it
has been naturally out of their practice as lawyers. So the project  is  far
advanced and we will be reporting further to this  House  on  progress,  but
that does not mean that whatever other ad hoc amendments  are  required  for
the Companies Act will wait for this three or three-and half-year project.

I think all the other hon members support the Bill and  have  actually  said
everything there is to be said. So I just want to say thank you to  all  the
parties for supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
  AFFAIRS ON UN AGREEMENT ON CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF STRADDLING FISH
                   STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS

REV M CHABAKU: Chairperson, this is a statement on the UN Convention on  the
Law of the Sea relating to the UN Agreement on Conservation  and  Management
of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.

Ever since the democratic  South  Africa  proved  itself  to  be  a  leading
example of  a  nation  committed  to  the  sustainable  use  of  its  marine
resources, it has since 1994 steadily transformed the rules  for  commercial
recreational fishing with its own exclusive economic zone,  the  broad  aims
of which  are:  one,  ensuring  fisheries'  sustainability;  two,  promoting
greater participation by previously  disadvantaged  groups  of  the  fishing
industry; three, including those with a stake in fisheries  to  be  involved
in its running;  four,  ensuring  there  is  no  wasteful  use;  and,  five,
allowing it to meet its international promises.

Since the late 1970s most coastal  nations,  including  South  Africa,  have
claimed an exclusive economic zone over waters out  to  200  nautical  miles
from their coast and, in this area they have  sole  control  over  the  fish
stocks. Since some fish stocks, however, cross the waters of  the  exclusive
economic zones and the high seas - by high seas I mean international  waters
beyond exclusive economic zones - most coastal nations have a keen  interest
in some regulation of high seas fishing.

In an attempt to minimise overfishing of the high seas, the  United  Nations
drafted the Convention on the Law of the Sea,  requiring  countries  to  co-
operate in the conservation  and  control  of  fish  stocks.  This  is  done
primarily through the establishment  of  regional  fisheries  organisations.
Currently there are more than 20  such  organisations  dealing  with  marine
fisheries.

There are two types of  regional  fisheries  organisations:  Firstly,  those
that  deal  with  specific  species,  such  as  the   Commission   for   the
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and International Commission  for  the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, and, secondly,  those  that  are  regionally
oriented, such as the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries  Organisation  -  Nafo  -
and the Commission for Eastern Central Atlantic Fisheries.

The  number  and  intensity  of  arguments  over  high  seas   fishing   are
increasing. Over the past decade or two,  we  have  witnessed  a  number  of
arguments over high seas fishing. A protracted and at  times  violent  clash
began in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation  between  Canada  and
the European Union in 1986.

The European Union began giving itself independent shares for  several  fish
stocks, far more than its official  allocation  under  Nafo.  After  several
years of arguments and steep declines in some  stocks,  the  European  Union
agreed to abide by Nafo decisions. However in 1995, Canada  forcibly  seized
a Spanish vessel, the Estai, in international waters, alleging that  it  was
overfishing.

The resulting international crisis was only resolved by  the  implementation
by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation of wide-cover  control  and
watch programmes, including satellite devices on 100%  and  human  observers
on 30% of vessels fishing in the Nafo regulatory area. Similar schemes  have
begun to be adopted in other regional fishing organisations.

Our own country has been involved in a  dispute  with  Spain  over  the  few
remaining swordfish stocks in the North  Atlantic.  This  species  has  been
overfished,  requiring  decreases  in  the   quotas   established   by   the
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.

The major fisher of the stock, Spain, began in the late  1980s  to  increase
its fishing effort on swordfish in the South  Atlantic  where  it  has  come
into conflict with countries such as Brazil, Namibia and South Africa  which
want to develop their own domestic fisheries. These countries have  demanded
an increased share of the quota, while Spain, represented by the EU  in  the
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, refused  to
reduce its share.

This agreement will provide a legal  framework  through  which  disputes  of
this nature can be resolved. It creates  a  binding  treaty  with  teeth  to
secure the  conservation  and  sustainable  management  of  straddling  fish
stocks. Ratification will also assist in ensuring  that  the  harvesting  of
fish stocks by vessels of other nations in waters beyond our  own  exclusive
economic zone does not undermine our domestic management of  such  fisheries
within our waters.

With a growing interest by  our  fishing  industry  in  fishing  beyond  our
exclusive  economic  zone,  South  Africa  also  stands  to   benefit   from
widespread  stocks  and,   by   sticking   to   this   agreement,   improved
opportunities for the South African fishing industry to undertake high  seas
fishing operations. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
     AFFAIRS ON AGREEMENT ON THE CONSERVATION OF ALBATROSSES AND PETRELS
Rev P MOATSHE:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  this  is  a  statement  on  the
Agreement on the Conservation  of  Albatrosses  and  Petrels.  Seabirds  are
being taken incidentally in various commercial  longline  fisheries  in  the
world and concerns are arising about the impact of these incidental takes.

The incidental catch of seabirds may also have an adverse impact on  fishing
productivity and profitability. Governments,  nongovernmental  organisations
and commercial fishery associations have petitioned for regulatory  measures
to reduce the mortality of seabirds in longline fisheries in which  seabirds
are taken incidentally.

The Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels  was  developed
under the Convention on  the  Conservation  of  Migratory  Species  of  Wild
Animals, also  known  as  the  Bonn  Convention.  The  Bonn  Convention  was
concluded in 1979 and came into force in 1983. South Africa  acceded  to  it
in 1991. The Bonn Convention encourages  international  co-operative  action
to conserve and manage migratory species.

Albatrosses and petrels are highly  migratory,  travelling  long  distances.
For example, the black-browed albatross travels from the southwest  Atlantic
to feed in the Benguela system off  South  Africa's  west  coast.  Longlines
catch surface-feeding seabirds  that  consume  vertebrate  and  invertebrate
prey which resemble bait. During the setting  of  the  lines,  seabirds  are
hooked as they attempt to capture the bait. Birds that  habitually  scavenge
floating material from the sea surface are also susceptible to being  hooked
on longlines.

Concerns  about  the  world  incidental  catch  of  seabirds  led   to   the
development of the International Plan of Action for Reducing the  Incidental
Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries - IPOA-Seabirds - a  voluntary  plan
endorsed by the Food and Agriculture  organisation  of  the  United  Nations
Committee on Fisheries in February 1999.

The IPOA-Seabirds applies to countries in whose waters longline  fishing  is
being conducted by their own or  foreign  vessels,  and  to  countries  that
conduct longline fishing on the high seas  and  in  the  exclusive  economic
zones of other countries, and calls on all countries to implement the  IPOA-
Seabirds through the development of individual national plans of action.

The agreement applies to 21 species of Southern Hemisphere  albatrosses  and
to seven species of Southern  Hemisphere  petrels.  Five  of  the  albatross
species and four of the petrel species breed on Prince  Edward  Island.  All
are listed as vulnerable in the 2000 edition - the latest edition -  of  The
Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland.

The sixth meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Bonn Convention  which
took place in 1999 in Somerset  West,  South  Africa,  listed  a  number  of
petrel species in Appendix II, noted the threats posed  by  fishery  bycatch
to albatrosses and petrels, and requested relevant  parties  to  develop  an
agreement, under the convention, for the conservation of albatrosses.

The wording of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and  Petrels
was drafted in Hobart in 2000 and finalised at a  meeting  hosted  by  South
Africa in  Cape  Town  in  February  2001.  The  agreement  was  opened  for
signature in Canberra on 20 June 2001. By  August  2002,  eight  states  had
signed the agreement and it had been ratified by Australia and New  Zealand.
Other signatories are the United Kingdom, Chile, France and Peru.

We therefore support the ratification of this  agreement  in  its  entirety.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the

  THE RESPECT FOR, PROTECTION OF AND PROMOTION AND FULFILMENT OF THE RIGHTS
                                OF THE CHILD

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Unfortunately,  we  have  received  a
message that the Minister of Social Development will only join us later,  so
Mr T S Setona will speak first. He is the acting chairperson  of  the  joint
monitoring committee.

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, the  hon  the  Minister  of  Social  Development
Comrade Skweyiya, in absentia, hon members of  this  august  Chamber,  today
marks yet another important  milestone  in  the  unfolding  history  of  our
institution  as  this  Chamber,  once  again,   reaffirms   its   unwavering
commitment to the pursuit of the fundamental rights of the child.

The debate this afternoon confirms, in no uncertain terms, that the task  of
respecting, protecting and promoting the fulfilment of  the  rights  of  the
child is firmly on the agenda of our Government, not as an add-on item,  but
as an integral part of the day-to-day tasks of governance.

We do this at a time when the voice of our people,  the  ANC,  has  declared
this month as the month of the child in order to  mobilise  our  communities
behind programmes that seek to promote the fulfilment of the rights  of  the
child within the context and the spirit of  Vuk'uZenzele,  as  announced  by
our President on the  occasion  of  his  state  of  the  nation  address  in
February 2002.

As we debate this important topic this afternoon, the  country's  eyes  will
be firmly fixed on  us  with  a  great  sense  of  hope  that  steadily  and
gradually South Africa will be destined for a future  worth  living  in  for
our children, a future in  which  hunger,  poverty,  homelessness,  disease,
abuse, neglect and all other forms of dehumanisation will be things  of  the
past.

The extent to which we inspire hope in the men  and  women  of  our  country
will not be measured in terms of endless lamentations about  the  statistics
and our past history, but more importantly in terms of our unity of  purpose
and vision in terms of tackling the  unbearable  conditions  of  daily  life
that face our children.

Indeed, our entry point in this regard should  be  an  honest  and  critical
appraisal of the policies and programmes that  our  Government  has  put  in
place to address the plight of the children. In  doing  that,  an  objective
grasp of the resources at the disposal  of  our  country  to  address  these
myriad and pressing challenges should be taken into account.

In the eight  years  it  has  been  in  power,  since  27  April  1994,  our
Government has put in place a wide range  of  legislative  and  programmatic
instruments to reverse the decades-long legacy  of  colonialism  that  never
accorded  children  the  right  to  a  place  in  society,   in   terms   of
developmental and social security needs, in order to grow in peace,  harmony
and common brotherhood.

Indeed, the tasks and challenges ahead are enormous  and  daunting,  but  in
the eight years since 1994 we have great cause to celebrate as  a  basis  of
consolidating  our  efforts  to  deepen  the  culture  of  respect  for  and
protection of the rights of the child.

We proceed from the understanding and conviction that  a  nation  that  does
not value its children is destined to a  bleak  future  and  ultimate  self-
destruction. The history  of  this  country,  in  terms  of  protecting  and
promoting the rights of the child, cannot be written in terms  of  the  pre-
April 1994 democratic breakthrough. We stand here today when  the  doors  of
learning and culture have been widely opened to all children, thus  allowing
them the  opportunity  to  learn  and  develop  their  potential  as  future
competent citizens of our country.

The deracialisation of the education system and subsequent  opening  of  all
schools to  all  children  represent  a  qualitative  step  in  the  overall
transformation of our country into the nonracial, democratic  and  nonsexist
society that we all seek to construct.

The post-1994 generation of children, unlike many generations  whose  growth
and development were  defined  by  the  ideology  of  racial  supremacy,  is
growing in an atmosphere of common brotherhood and identity  that  knows  no
colour bar. They appreciate, understand and identify themselves as  brothers
and sisters sharing a common heritage and  destiny.  They  know  no  Indian,
white, black or coloured, but they know and understand that  they  are  part
of one South African nation in the making.

As we debate this afternoon, we can proudly and  confidently  say  that  the
ideals enshrined in the Freedom Charter on  abolishing  the  colour  bar  in
cultural life, in sport and in education have been  accomplished.  This  is,
indeed, great cause for celebration.

The Government has gone a step  further  to  acknowledge  that  poverty  and
homelessness hamper and  retard  the  development  of  the  child.  In  this
regard, concrete measures to push back the frontiers of  poverty  afflicting
the children have been implemented through the  national  schools  nutrition
programme and other social grants aimed  at  children,  such  as  the  child
support grant and the foster care grant  for  children  who  are  in  foster
care.

The massive delivery of housing to address the legacy  of  homelessness  and
lack of shelter for our people  has  gone  a  long  way  in  addressing  the
comfort and security of our children.

The decent, healthy and secure growth and development of children cannot  be
separated from  the  livelihood  of  their  mothers.  A  sick  mother  will,
logically, bear an unhealthy child. Hence, the  provision  of  free  medical
services to pregnant women and to children  from  birth  to  six  years  old
represents one of the milestones in addressing the  plight  of  children  in
this country.
These steps, coupled with the implementation of primary  health  care,  have
reduced the rate of infant mortality to unprecedented levels,  levels  never
seen before in the history of this country. The Government has put in  place
structures and mechanisms to mainstream children's issues across  all  state
organs through the Office on the  Rights  of  the  Child  which  is  in  the
Presidency. This has brought about a holistic  and  integrated  approach  to
children's issues, as opposed to a narrow departmentalisation of  children's
issues.

The establishment,  by  Parliament,  of  a  Joint  Monitoring  Committee  on
Children, Youth  and  Persons  with  Disabilities  is  one  instrument  that
positions Parliament to exercise  oversight,  from  time  to  time,  of  the
Government's programmes in so far as they impact children.

Through this committee and many other relevant Government  agencies,  a  lot
of work is being done  in  terms  of  mobilising  communities  in  concerted
efforts to combat the abuse of children and promote their rights where  they
live. Today, more than any other time in the history of our country,  public
consciousness around the  rights,  protection  and  abuse  of  children  has
deepened.
One was, indeed, filled with a great sense of pride  in  the  youth  of  our
country in the Free State province in June this year when  they  went  on  a
mass volunteer campaign  under  the  banner  of  the  ANC  Youth  League  to
register  children  for  child  support  grants,  in  conjunction  with  the
Department of Social Development, as part of their programme to  commemorate
the month of the child.

As we celebrate our achievements,  we,  equally,  are  haunted  by  daunting
challenges in the arena  of  children's  rights.  In  his  foreword  to  the
publication of the Volunteer Child Network, the President  of  our  country,
the hon T Mbeki, said and I quote:


  No South African can easily rest at night while reports of  sexual  abuse
  against children are heard with such regularity in our communities. As  a
  self-respecting, compassionate and democratic society,  we  are  urgently
  engaged in ensuring that action is taken to deal with existing cases  and
  are resolute in our commitment to curb such horrors in the future.

This reflects the magnitude of the problem of child  rape  we  face  in  our
country today. While the sensationalism around  these  issues  has  obscured
the real Government efforts to deal with the issues, it is  no  secret  that
levels of reporting on these crimes have improved, thus showing  the  levels
of public consciousness around the issues of child rape.

The SA Police Service has established a special unit which deals with  child
rape in which police officers are  trained  in  the  intricacies  of  issues
pertaining to child rape. It is imperative for all of us to understand  that
the acts of abuse and rape against children are committed in the privacy  of
our homes, thus making it difficult  for  police  to  police  this  kind  of
crime.

This therefore means that more effort  should  be  made  in  mobilising  and
conscientising our communities to deal with  these  crimes  in  a  proactive
manner. In this regard, we should commend the  initiative  by  the  CSIR  in
establishing a Web-based database of organisations that are active in  child
abuse prevention  and  reduction,  which  will  be  launched  in  Parliament
tomorrow.

This Web-based  database  is  a  network  of  a  wide  range  of  Government
departments and civil society formations directly dealing with  child  abuse
prevention and reduction. This  initiative  is  a  practical  expression  of
volunteerism and partnership  in  making  South  Africa  safe  for  all  our
children.

Our major challenge in the current period is the scourge of  HIV/Aids  which
has left many children orphaned, creating, in some  instances,  child-headed
families - a trend which seems to be growing in our country. This poses  yet
another economic burden on the state, as it will obviously expand  the  list
of beneficiaries of our social security system.

Whilst we should welcome any move by Government to address this  problem  in
monetary terms, we should strengthen our resolve  and  efforts  to  mobilise
our communities against the scourge of HIV/Aids as  there  is  currently  no
cure for this disease.

Let us unite in a practical partnership in making South Africa safe for  all
children. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I welcome the hon Minister  of  Social
Development who can now address  the  Chamber.  Hon  Minister,  we  got  the
message that you were delayed somewhere along the way.

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, unfortunately I have to  do
the same thing here that I did in the National  Assembly  on  the  issue  of
children. That is why I am a bit late.

Chairperson, hon members, ladies  and  gentlemen,  our  debate  today  is  a
highly topical debate as children are our greatest and most  precious  gift.
They are our future and our greatest asset  and,  therefore,  need  all  the
care and protection that we can give them.

During my Budget Vote earlier this year I informed members that the  primary
theme of our work in Social Development was to  put  children  first.  Since
then, in my consultations with various communities, I have  been  confronted
by the cries of our children and their families. They  cry  about  rape  and
abuse. They cry about poverty. They cry about HIV/Aids and other diseases.

Our debate today should focus on how  we,  as  the  custodians  of  all  our
children in South Africa, not only listen to those cries, but  also  respond
to them decisively and  positively.  It  is  highly  appropriate  that  this
debate is taking place during  the  month  of  social  development,  thereby
creating a good opportunity to realise and entrench further  the  rights  of
children that are enshrined in our Constitution.

Since 1994, the South African Government  has  put  in  place  a  number  of
measures to promote and protect the rights of children in this country.  Hon
members will well remember that Madiba committed his Government in  1994  to
putting  children  first.  On  16  June  1995  South  Africa  announced  its
ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

The Constitution adopted in 1997 guaranteed children  socioeconomic  rights.
South Africa drafted and ratified the African  Charter  on  the  Rights  and
Welfare of the Child in January 2000. South Africa ratified the  Declaration
and Agenda for Action  emanating  from  the  First  World  Congress  Against
Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in 1996.

The Government is in the process of acceding to the UN Optional Protocol  to
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the  Sale  of  Children,  Child
Prostitution and Child Pornography.

The National Programme of Action  for  Children  in  South  Africa  of  1996
provides  the  overall  framework  of  Government   for   implementing   the
Government's commitment to the programme and the progressive realisation  of
children's rights. The NPA makes provision for  our  children's  needs,  and
for children in need of special protection measures, namely  children  whose
circumstances place their survival, protection and development at risk.

In South Africa the process towards recognising children as worthy  citizens
has commenced with admirable energy and commitment since the advent  of  the
first democratic Government. It is crucial that this  process  is  continued
with increased vigour by the  Government  and  relevant  organisations.  The
necessary  policies  and  practices  that  will  ensure  that  we  meet  our
Government with regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child  have
been developed. What is needed is the attainment of  all  the  developmental
goals and human rights that have been  set  by  our  forechildren  in  South
Africa.

The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the child as an  active
subject of rights, and articulates the  child's  right  to  be  involved  in
decision-making that affects him or her. This principle is one  that  should
be applied at all levels of society and with regard to all  aspects  of  the
child's life. Within the family, at school, in the country and  at  national
and international policy-making levels, children's views and  voices  should
be heard and taken into account.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child combines civil  and
political rights with  economic,  social  and  cultural  rights,  and  draws
attention to special needs of children, such as adoption,  and  to  economic
and sexual exploitation and exposure to drug abuse.  It  is  the  instrument
that truly recognises the interdependence, indivisibility  and  universality
of human rights.

The convention  rests  on  the  four  groups  of  rights:  survival  rights,
development  rights,  protection  rights  and  participation   rights.   The
participation rights refer to the child's right to the  freedom  to  express
an opinion and to have a say in matters affecting his or her life.

There are two definitions of  participation  rights:  participation  in  the
sense of taking part or being present; and participation  in  the  sense  of
knowing that one's actions are taken note of and may be acted upon.

It is my belief that children  and  the  perspective  on  their  rights  are
important. Firstly, children's perspectives on their rights may differ  from
those of adults. Secondly,  children's  concepts  of  their  rights  may  be
useful in the design and development of procedures  for  the  implementation
of these rights in a manner that is most protective of children's dignity.

Thirdly, eliciting children's  views  on  their  rights  shows  respect  for
children  as  persons.  Finally,  accepting  children's   perspectives   has
implications for children's legal and political socialisation.

In addition, there are  other  important  reasons  to  promote  and  protect
children. Children's  participation  is  a  basic  need  for  healthy  human
development. Children's  participation  is  a  precondition  for  democratic
citizenship,  and  children's  participation   improves   the   quality   of
provisioning and provisions for young people.
The youth of  South  Africa  played  a  special  role  in  spearheading  the
struggle for liberation from apartheid. This usually important  contribution
to the processes of political transformation received  national  recognition
through  South  Africa's  designation  of  June  26  as   Youth   Day,   the
ratification of the United Nations Convention on the  Rights  of  the  Child
and the inclusion of section 28 in our Constitution.

It is thus incumbent upon the adult population not only  to  adhere  to  the
worthy principles underlying the rights and protection of our children,  but
also to be highly proactive in ensuring that  our  fellow  citizens  do  the
same. We have to wipe all child abuse, of any nature, off the face  of  this
country. It will take vigilance, discipline and commitment to do so, but  we
have no option.

At the beginning of this year the President asked us  all  to  put  children
first and to make this year the year of the child. As the Government and  as
the ANC, we have been going through the whole country trying to talk to  our
people to ensure that children get a better deal in  society  and  in  their
communities.

We hope that, in that process, we will be able to  raise  the  consciousness
of each and every citizen in this country to the plight of our  children  so
that our children are able to get what is rightfully theirs. The grant  that
they get from the Government should be given to them,  and  they  should  be
rightfully, carefully and sensitively treated within the family  and  within
our communities.

As I said at the beginning, if we fought for a future South Africa,  we  did
not fight for ourselves as such, we fought  for  the  generations  to  come.
Those generations are the children. They are the ones who are going  to  put
into effect what our real aims were. In our lifetime we might  not  be  able
achieve that - individually and collectively. We must accept  that.  But  it
is the children who will be able to do that, and  they  must  get  a  better
deal than the one we got from from our parents. [Applause.]

Mr  N  M  RAJU:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  special  delegates,  hon
colleagues, in 1995 the Government signed the United Nations  Convention  on
the Rights of the Child, so the  obligation  to  obey  special,  universally
accepted rules about how children should be  treated  is  immense  on  South
Africa as a nation and on South Africans as a people.
The moral integrity of a nation is reflected by the emphasis  it  places  on
the protection of the rights of the child. In recent months there  has  been
too much media space devoted to the abuse and neglect of children.  It  does
not require scholarly research to arrive at  the  conclusion  that  children
grow best  in  a  family  or  home  where  they  can  be  happy,  loved  and
understood. Unfortunately, we have a situation in which  increasing  numbers
join the world of street children - homeless, loveless, careless,  unwanted,
neglected, exploited and abused.

Child rape, child prostitution, child labour and, the ultimate  disgrace  in
some countries, the compulsory recruitment of  children  for  use  in  armed
conflict are some of the major areas of concern.

A nation worth its salt must be actively  involved  in  the  prohibition  of
child labour and the commercial sexual exploitation  of  children.  Children
must be protected from becoming victims  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases
and HIV/Aids infections.

One of the most barbaric views that has characterised  child  rape  recently
is the implausible belief - the fallacy - among perpetrators of  child  rape
that sex with a child can cure Aids. There is a growing crescendo  of  calls
by public citizens of our country for a state of emergency to combat  savage
attacks on children, after a study revealed  that  public  Child  Protection
Units, that is the CPUs, are fighting a valiant but losing  battle  to  help
South Africa's battered and abused children.

We think here of a person, even in  this  modern  age,  like  the  beast  of
Brits, who is alleged to have abused  his  children,  kept  them  away  from
school, and sjambokked them at will for the tiniest of offences, if  he  was
not taking pot shots at the boys as they rolled around in drums  as  a  form
of target practice. This ugly  remnant  from  the  age  of  the  Flintstones
should no doubt be incarcerated in a dank dungeon and the keys  thrown  into
the moat. But, no, we are living in the age of human rights, so  he  has  to
be given VIB status: Very Important Barbarian.

Statistics show that 120 000 children were raped or abused over  a  21-month
period. However, a more worrying factor is that only 8%, that is  less  than
10 000, of the cases resulted in  conviction.  The  spokesperson  for  Women
Against Child Abuse, Miranda Friedman, explained that a lack  of  resources,
poor pay and little recognition were factors that hampered  those  who  were
fighting the battle to contain this assault on the rights of the child.

Andre Martin, spokesperson for the Ministry of Safety and  Security,  called
upon the community, parents and teachers to render assistance  in  arresting
this scourge, these crimes  against  children,  because  the  protection  of
children is everyone's business. Hon members have just  heard  the  hon  the
Minister put it so aptly, when he said: ``After all, we are  all  custodians
of our children.''

Another  uninspiring  scenario  emerging  in  our  country's   socioeconomic
landscape is that of children dying of malnutrition on a daily  basis.  This
is untenable  in  a  country  such  as  ours,  which  has  a  constitutional
obligation to deliver basic child rights.

The hon the Minister, to his credit, has admitted that the situation on  the
ground in this respect is far from good. Hence, the  hon  the  Minister  has
undertaken to extend the child support grant to children up to  the  age  of
14. However, this initiative is only likely to materialise some time in  the
year 2004.
The focus on children  affected  by  HIV/Aids  has  been  announced  by  the
provincial  imbizos  undertaken  by  the  hon   the   Minister   of   Social
Development. I want to pause here and  congratulate  the  hon  Minister  who
goes about his work in a quiet and dignified manner, showing that he  really
cares about the problems afflicting South Africans as far as the welfare  of
our children are concerned.

The hardships experienced by  children  who  are  abandoned  or  who  become
reluctant orphans can only be imagined. I am  not  even  talking  about  the
plight of our children and families that encounter  obstacles  in  accessing
social grants, especially grants intended to support those who care for  our
children.  For  example,  birth  certificates  and  identity  documents  are
sometimes not easily obtained in the poorer rural areas.

As South Africans we must not fail our children. We ought to evince  greater
respect for the protection and fulfilment of the rights of  the  child,  and
we must heed the SOS signals - the cries for help. If we fail,  we  will  be
guilty of a travesty of justice. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister, colleagues, the  acting  chair  of
the joint monitoring committee, Mr Setona, has already  made  mention  of  a
number of issues.

It is now over eight months since President Thabo Mbeki put the question  to
all of us as to `` ... whether what we are doing  as  the  legislature,  the
executive and the  judiciary,  as  well  as  the  fourth  estate  and  civil
society,  is  helping  to  lift  from  the  shoulders  of  our  people   the
intolerable burden of poverty and underdevelopment''

In the ANC we are, as a collective, heeding  President's  Mbeki  injunction,
not in a narrow sense, but in the sense that we are  indeed  proud  to  lead
the onslaught against the  challenges  that  it  represents,  most  notably,
those in education. The greatest challenge to us in education  -  and  I  am
sure members will agree with me -  is  to  deliver  our  children  from  the
historical legacy of apartheid education  in  our  endeavours  to  lead  our
country away from this legacy  and  put  our  children  on  the  path  to  a
prosperous future through quality education.

The Department of  Education  continually  reviews  our  progress,  or  lack
thereof, to ensure that our children's right  are  protected,  promoted  and
fulfilled. Despite limited resources, the department is doing all it can  to
ensure that the vision of the President, the  Government  and,  indeed,  the
overwhelming majority of South Africans becomes a reality.

In doing so, the department has launched a number of activities,  strategies
and programmes with respect to child protection. This can only  be  attained
through a major shift in our  educational  values,  hence  the  department's
launch of the ``Values in Education Initiative'' in the year 2000.

The findings of  this  initiative  were  published  in  the  ``Manifesto  on
Values, Education and Democracy'' in August  2001.  The  refined  curriculum
for 2005, for instance, has incorporated the  key  findings  of  the  Values
Initiative in new or revised  areas  of  study.  This  bodes  well  for  the
protection and promotion of children's rights. A directorate  called  ``Race
and Values'' has also been created in the department. The  challenge  facing
us at this juncture is to ensure that these values are cultivated.

Yes, the department regards the right and full access to  education  by  our
country's children as essential elements of its mandate. It  has  undertaken
and is undertaking a number of programmes to make full access and  enrolment
a reality.

The starting point is knowledge, and there are a  number  of  factors  which
potentially or actually exclude  children.  These  include  the  lack  of  a
family income to pay  for  school  fees  and  the  school  being  an  unsafe
environment. These factors are addressed in the following way.

A lack of  income  should  not  bar  any  child  from  access  to  a  decent
education. To this end,  the  department  has  produced  a  pamphlet  called
``Rights and Responsibilities of Parents'' in 2000,  which  was  distributed
to post offices and other service points nationally.

This pamphlet  made  all  parents  and  legal  guardians  aware  that  their
children had a right to free education  if  their  income  was  too  low  to
afford school fees. At present,  an  updated  version  of  the  pamphlet  is
available and ready for distribution. I hope my colleagues as  parents  will
be able to get this pamphlet and also mobilise our communities with it.

A lack of safety in schools is a worldwide problem  affecting  the  ability,
particularly of girls, to attend school regularly and to work with focus  in
school. In this regard,  the  department  established  school  safety  as  a
critical part of the Culture of Learning  and  Teaching  Campaign  in  1997,
better known as Colts.

This campaign is very active and  has  established  a  number  of  important
initiatives, including, firstly, the  Ikusasa  Lethu  self-defence  project.
This project has  already  trained  1 010  school-based  educators  and  400
learners in 666 schools in  six  provinces  on  how  to  protect  themselves
against any attack and harassment. Secondly, the Signposts for Safe  Schools
Workbook is available. This workbook was designed in  conjunction  with  the
SA Police Service. It will  be  sent  to  every  school-based  educator  and
police station across the country early next year.

Thirdly, with regard to drug abuse  policy  and  implementation  guidelines,
the department has developed a policy which has been gazetted and  is  being
finalised that is based on public comments. The guidelines will  go  to  all
schools to assist them in dealing with this growing problem. The  department
is also assisting individual schools which have a particular problem in  the
management of drug abuse.

The spirit, as with all the department's safety  work,  is  set  within  the
context of  restorative  justice,  balanced  by  the  need  to  protect  all
learners within the framework of the Constitution.

Fourthly, the department  has  also  developed  a  draft  sexual  harassment
policy for learners which supplements the regulation and material to  assist
educational institutions to manage sexual harassment in  the  workplace.  In
addition, it also collects statistics quarterly  on  the  numbers  of  cases
reported of sexual abuse of learners by educators and  the  results  of  the
disciplinary or judiciary processes.

We, as the select committee, regard this problem as  extremely  serious  and
welcome the department's effort to make everyone understand  its  magnitude.
We went to a public hearing on this issue. Everybody was thrown off  balance
to the extent that they could not agree on the issue, but I  am  happy  that
Parliament has taken a very decisive decision on this issue.

Also, provincial departments are driving  a  process  to  make  all  schools
accessible, smart and safe. We welcome the national department's support  by
providing research and guidelines in this regard.

In conclusion, I began my input on this  very  important  debate  by  making
reference to the statement by the President. I want  to  end  with  a  quote
from his speech when he said, ``Our country has, in real  terms  and  within
its means, moved further forward''.

Although we are nowhere near to providing a complete safety net for all  the
children, the President is  right.  Together  we  are  making  and  we  will
continue to make a determined assault on  that  which  affects  the  social,
economic and psychological wellbeing of our children. [Applause.]

Siswati paragraphs follows:)

[We, as children and adults in 2002, are far better off  than  those  of  us
who had to struggle during the apartheid years for our basic  human  rights.
We now have a change of Government that favours the poor and the  oppressed,
and are constantly looking for ways in which to  improve  the  circumstances
in which they find  themselves.  We  have  conquered  the  battle  that  our
leaders in the past only dreamed of conquering in their frequent appeals  to
the international community  for  intervention  to  stop  the  racist  white
regime in South Africa.

However, we cannot afford to pat ourselves on  the  back  and  rest  on  our
laurels. The new enemy is poverty,  deadly  diseases,  crime,  child  abuse,
especially of girls. Those are children that are abused first at home by  us
parents who treat them as slave girls by making them wives at our homes.

Just as we fought for our freedom, we need to fight for the  rights  of  our
children, that they be treated with respect,  that  they  be  protected  and
that they be aided into developing to the  best  of  their  abilities.  This
Government  has  shown  its  commitment  to  this  nation's  children.   We,
individual  South  Africans,  need  to  do  the  same  and  follow  in   the
Government's footsteps.

In 1990, during the World Summit for Children,  world  leaders  gathered  in
New York to promote the  wellbeing  of  children.  At  this  occasion,  they
signed a World Declaration on the Survival, Protection  and  Development  of
Children and a Plan of Action. They set a number of targets that were to  be
reached by the year 2000. South Africa submitted  an  End-decade  Report  to
the United Nations, a document that outlined the progress made in the  lives
of South African Children.

While this report shows significant progress overall  in  the  wellbeing  of
the child, we are still haunted by the inequities of the past which  impacts
directly on our ability as parents to provide adequately for  our  children.
There are still socioeconomic imbalances between black  children  and  white
children, urban and rural children,  high  unemployment,  limited  resources
and a growing orphan population.

In conclusion, I just wish to say that legislation and  good  intentions  on
their own do not provide a protective,  nurturing  environment  in  which  a
child can develop into a well-rounded,  free-thinking  adult.  Our  children
need the  collective  efforts  of  all  of  us.  We  as  parents,  teachers,
religious organisations and communities need to get back to  the  old  tried
and tested tradition of, ``it takes a village to raise a child'',  and  roll
up our sleeves to take care of our nation's children.]

In its strategic plan of 2002  to  2005,  the  SA  Police  Service  itemised
crimes against women and children as one of its priority areas in its  crime
prevention and combating programme.  With  this  particular  programme,  the
SAPS is looking at improving service  delivery  to  all  victims  of  crime,
improving services provided by the Family  Violence,  Child  Protection  and
Sexual Offences Units to all victims of abuse  and  implementing  the  Safer
Schools Project at priority station areas, amongst other things.

The annual report of the Department  of  Correctional  Services  of  2001-02
focuses on the responsibility of young children in prisons, and on  mothers,
children and youth in prisons. In fact, the Correctional Services  Act,  Act
111 of 1998, states that the child of a female prisoner may  be  allowed  to
remain with the mother up to the age of five years.

Mothers are, however, encouraged to give permission  to  their  families  to
look after their children. The personal safety and  development  of  infants
who stay in prison with their mothers remain a priority for the  department.
Special mother care and child units were established in  eight  prisons.  As
of 31 March 2002, there were  190  infant  children  in  prison  with  their
mothers.

Despite measures to remove children from the criminal justice system,  there
are still instances in which children are sent to  prison.  The  department,
therefore, established separate facilities for youths in prisons to  enhance
the education, rehabilitation and developmental  prospects  of  these  young
prisoners. However, a large number of youths are  accommodated  in  sections
of adult prisons,  although  separately  from  adult  prisoners.  Currently,
there are 13 youth correctional or development centres countrywide.

More disturbing, however, is the 158,67% increase in the overall  number  of
children serving prison sentences from  January  1995  to  July  2001.  Even
though children comprise less than 2% of the  sentenced  prison  population,
this rapid increase requires close monitoring and  intervention  strategies.
This is especially worrying given the recent  TV  documentary  exposing  the
prostitution of a juvenile prisoner to service adult prisoners.

Positive legislation, such as section 28 of the Constitution,  the  National
Youth Commission Act and the  Abolition  of  Corporal  Punishment  Act  were
legislated, principally, to protect the legal rights  of  the  child.  South
Africa regards the development, protection and promotion of children as  one
of its top responsibilities, hence the location of the Office on the  Rights
of the Child in the Presidency, the highest office in Government.

It is  envisaged  that  the  long-awaited  Child  Justice  Bill,  which  was
recently tabled in Parliament, will provide a more  structured  approach  to
children in conflict with the law. One of the  primary  tenets  underpinning
this proposed Bill is to provide greater scope for the  use  of  alternative
methods other than arrest in ensuring that  accused  children  attend  court
proceedings. Also, the  proposed  Bill  looks  at  enhanced  protection  for
children during trial procedures, such as the noting of confessions.

South Africa ratified the OAU Charter on the Rights and Responsibilities  of
the Child during 1999. Also, in keeping with  informing  children  of  their
rights, the Department of Justice and  Constitutional  Development  and  the
Department of Education took the UN Convention on the Rights of  the  Child,
ratified by the South African Government in 1995, rewrote and  explained  it
in simple language and in a colourful  picture-book  format  that  is  user-
friendly to  all  children  in  South  Africa.  This  book  also  encourages
children to get to know what their rights are in terms of the convention.

Ministers Penuell Maduna and Kader Asmal and their departments also  appeal,
through this book, to children to respect the rights of others and  to  help
Government build the future of our country.

[In conclusion, I want to state clearly that good  laws  and  objectives  do
bring about a safe community and a good upbringing, which all  our  children
need very much so that they can grow up to be good citizens who are able  to
make good decisions.

Our children need us to be united and to be one in bringing them up.  We  as
parents, teachers,  churches  and  communities  must  go  back  to  our  old
methods, which were mature and stable, with children developing properly  at
the homestead. We must roll up our sleeves as a nation and take care of  our
children. [Applause.]]

Mrs B S  MOHLAKA  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  Dr  Z  S  T
Skweyiya and all the hon members of the NCOP present, what  I  am  going  to
deal with here is what is happening the world over. Please  bear  with  with
me, because it appears as if I am the only special delegate and therefore  I
may not be on the same wavelength  as  previous  speakers.  [Interjections.]
[Laughter.] I am going to deal with child labour, amongst other things.
The  International  Labour  Organisation  has  estimated  that  250  million
children between the ages of five and 14 work in developing countries  -  at
least 120 million work on a full-time basis. Of these children, 61% were  in
Asia, 32% in Africa and 7% in Latin America. Most working children in  rural
areas were  found  in  agriculture.  Urban  children  worked  in  trade  and
services, with a smaller number in manufacturing, construction and  domestic
service.

Conditions of child labour range from that of  four-year-olds  tied  to  rug
looms to keep them from running away, to 17-year-olds  helping  out  on  the
family farm. In some cases, a child's work can be helpful to him or her  and
to the family; working and  earning  can  be  a  positive  experience  in  a
child's growing up. This depends largely  on  the  age  of  the  child,  the
conditions in which the child works and  whether  work  prevents  the  child
from going to school.

The Children's Rights Division at Human Rights  Watch  has  largely  focused
its efforts on forced and bonded  child  labour,  which  has  a  devastating
impact on children. Children who work long hours,  often  in  dangerous  and
unhealthy conditions, are exposed  to  lasting  physical  and  psychological
harm. Working at looms, for example, has left  children  disabled  with  eye
damage, lung disease, stunted growth and a susceptibility  to  arthritis  as
they grow older.

Denied an education and a normal childhood, some are  confined  and  beaten,
and reduced to slavery. Some are denied freedom of movement - the  right  to
leave the workplace and go home to their families. Some  are  even  abducted
and forced to work, to sell liquor - bedayise utshwala  kanye  namasigarethi
[they sell liquor and cigarettes] - and cigarettes.

The human  right  abuses  in  these  practices  are  clear  and  acute.  Our
objectives in tackling these aspects of  the  complex  and  troubling  child
labour issue include drawing attention to the plight of  bonded  and  forced
child labourers, helping to end these appalling practices, and  contributing
to the debate on the rights dimension of the larger issue  of  children  and
work.

Bonded labour takes  place  when  a  family  receives  an  advance  payment,
sometimes as little as R150 or $15, to hand over a boy-child  or  girl-child
to the employer. In most cases, the child cannot work off the debt, nor  can
the family raise enough money to buy the child back.

The workplace  is  often  structured  so  that  expenses  and  interest  are
deducted from the child's  earnings  in  such  amounts  that  it  is  almost
impossible for the child to repay the debt. In some cases, the  labourer  is
generational, that is, the  child's  grandfather  or  great-grandfather  was
promised to an employer many years earlier with the understanding that  each
generation would provide the employer with a new worker, often with  no  pay
at all.

Bonded labour, normally debt bondage or peonage, is outlawed by the 1956  UN
Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave  Trade,  and
Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery.

Millions of children work as abandoned child labourers in  countries  around
the world - there are 15 million in India alone.  The  full  extent  of  the
problem has yet to be shown. Many are subjected to  severe  physical  abuse,
as in a case cited in the July 1995 Human Rights Watch report, which says:


  Two years ago at the age of seven, Anwar started  weaving  carpets  in  a
  village in Pakistan's province of Sindh. He was given some  food,  little
  free time, and no medical assistance. He  was  told  repeatedly  that  he
  could not stop working until he earned enough money  to  pay  an  alleged
  family debt. He was never told who in his family had borrowed  money  nor
  how much he had borrowed. Any time he made an error with his work, he was
  fined and the debt increased. Once when his work was considered to be too
  slow, he was beaten with a  stick.  Once  after  a  particularly  painful
  beating, he tried to run away, only to be apprehended by the local police
  who forcibly returned him to the carpet looms.

On the advocacy front, we have met with children's and human rights  groups,
as well as representatives from the United Nations Children's Fund -  Unicef
- and the International Labour Organisation to prevent children from  losing
their childhood, education and opportunities by being  entrapped  in  bonded
labour. We have also worked  to  provide  to  children's  organisations  and
international advocacy groups objective  on-the-spot  reporting  to  support
efforts to effect change.

I am now  going  to  talk  about  the  World  Bank.  A  Human  Rights  Watch
investigation and 1996 report: The Small  Hands  of  Slavery:  Bonded  Child
Labour in  India,  revealed  that  the  silk  industry,  which  was  heavily
supported by the World Bank,  employed  many  bonded  child  labourers.  The
World Bank, embarrassed by this disclosure, chose to include NGO  monitoring
of projects for child labour as a condition of support on future projects.

The bank has now acknowledged that child labour was  used  in  its  projects
and, in co-operation with the government and nongovernmental  organisations,
has  explored  pilot  programmes  that  would  remove  children   from   the
workplace, rehabilitate them, and provide them with education. How good!

In 1997, for the first time, the  World  Bank  promulgated  a  child  labour
policy to be considered when making  lending  agreements  to  countries.  In
addition, in 1998, the bank created a staff position  specifically  to  deal
with the issue of child labour in the course of bank lending.

Let me talk about street children a little bit. I know that a lot  has  been
said. Street children throughout the world are subjected to  physical  abuse
by police or have been murdered outright, as governments  treat  them  as  a
blight to be  eradicated,  rather  than  as  children  to  be  nurtured  and
protected. Fortunately, we do not do that in South Africa.

They are frequently detained arbitrarily by police simply because  they  are
homeless, or criminally charged  with  vague  offences  such  as  loitering,
vagrancy or petty theft. They are tortured, abused or  coerced  into  sexual
acts, or raped by police. Street children also make up  a  large  proportion
of the children who enter  criminal  justice  systems,  and  are  committed,
finally,  to  correctional  institutions  that  are  euphemistically  called
schools, often without  due  process.  Few  advocates  speak  up  for  these
children,  and  few  street  children  have  family  members  or   concerned
individuals willing and able to intervene on their behalf.

While street children receive national and international  public  attention,
that attention has been focused largely  on  the  socioeconomic  and  health
problems of the children - poverty, lack of  education,  Aids,  prostitution
and substance abuse. With the exception of the massive  killings  of  street
children in Brazil and Colombia, often by police, which Human  Rights  Watch
reported in 1994, very little  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  constant
police violence and abuse  from  which  many  children  suffer.  This  often
neglected side of street children's lives has been a focus of  Human  Rights
Watch research.

The public view of street  children  in  many  countries  is  overwhelmingly
negative. The public has often supported efforts to get these  children  off
the street, even though they may result in police roundups or  even  murder.
This  is  an  alarming  tendency  by  some  law-enforcement  personnel   and
civilians, business proprietors and their private security firms.

Children around the world suffer appalling abuse; too often street  children
are killed. In the past this  huge  and  largely  voiceless  population  has
fallen  through  the  cracks  in  the  international  human  rights   arena.
Traditional children's humanitarian groups  have  focused  mainly  on  vital
survival and development projects, and have  rarely  addressed  other  human
rights  concerns  because  they  could  not  afford   to   antagonise   host
governments.

Human rights groups have focused chiefly on the rights  of  adults.  As  the
human rights movement was founded out of concern for  political  dissidents,
it has sometimes overlooked  those,  like  children,  whose  persecution  is
unrelated to their political views.

In conclusion, 1999 marked the 10th anniversary of  the  Convention  on  the
Rights of the Child, which created an important place for children's  rights
on the world's agenda by being  the  most  widely  ratified  treaty  in  the
world. The convention was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly  on
November 20, 1989. It provides protection to  children  in  armed  conflict;
protection from discrimination; protection from torture  or  cruel,  inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment; protection within the justice  system;
and protection  from  economic  exploitation,  in  addition  to  many  other
fundamental   protections.   Despite   the    convention's    near-universal
ratification, children are still denied their basic rights.

We are pleased that in South Africa the Government has  extended  the  child
grant to recipients up to the age of 14. I  thank  the  Minister  for  that.
However, we are faced with a growing population of Aids orphans. How  do  we
overcome this obstacle? [Applause.]

Nkszn P C P MAJODINA: Ngale njikalanga, xa amathunzi enabile,  mandikhahlele
kuwe Mhlalingaphambili,  Mphathiswa  uGqirha  uSkweyiya  nakoogxa  bam  kule
Ndlu.

Iyachukumisa  into  yokuba  ndibe  ngomnye  othatha  inxaxheba  kule  ngxoxo
ibaluleke kangakanana. Yenza loo nto  ndingumzali  onoxanduva  lokuhlonipha,
akhusele,  azalisekise  amalungelo  abantwana  njengoko  umqulu  wamalungelo
abantwana usitsho.  Umntwana  owonwabileyo  ngosuka  kwikhaya  elonwabileyo,
abazali abakhuselekileyo nabazali abahloniphekileyo.  Umntwana  ke  okhulela
kwikhaya elinobundlobongela, ukhula engabazi ubuncwane  nobungcathu  bobomi.
Ukhula engayazi intlonipho.  Ukhula  engungantweni,  uphuma  silwe.  Uthando
ekhaya  nakuluntu  jikelele,  luba  negalelo   elikhulu   ngokungummangaliso
emntwaneni.   Umqulu   weNkululeko   ka-1955   uthi    kumhlathi    wethoba,
mandicaphule: "Bonke abantu baza  kuba  nelungelo  lokuhlala  apho  bathanda
khona,  kwizindlu  ezakhiwe  ngesidima,  baze  bakhulise   abantwana   babo,
izizalwane nezalamane zabo ngobutofotofo  nokhuseleko."  Akukho  namnye  oya
kuhlaselwa  yindlala  alale  engatyanga,  avale   ucango.   Yiyo   loo   nto
uRhulumente ophetheyo ezalisekisa eli  dinga,  ngokunika  abantwana  nabantu
iindawo  zokuhlala,  kungakhathaliseke  nokuba  ungumama  ongumzali  ozimele
yedwa. Unelungelo lokunikwa indlu yokuhlala ngulo uRhulumente  ukuze  ukwazi
ukukhulisa abantwana bakho  ngesidima,  njengoko  ndisenza  ukukhulisa  abam
oonyana, uMkhonto weSizwe noSiqhamo sothando. Lo mhlathi uthi  xa  uqhubeka,
Sihlalo obekekileyo: 'Kwezo ndawo abantu bahlala  kuzo  makubekho  izithuthi
zikawonke-wonke   ezifikelelekayo    nezikhuselekileyo.    Kube    neendlela
ezihambekayo  khon'  ukuze  abantwana  babe   nakho   ukufikelela   kumaziko
ophuhliso nasezikolweni ngokunjalo.'

Mandiyicinezele Sihlalo, into ethi, umntwana wam ngumntwana wakho,  umntwana
wakho ungumntwana wam. Into ebuhlungu kowakho  umntwana,  ibuhlungu  nakowam
umntwana. Ngelitsolileyo  ke,  inimba  mayibe  nye.  Masibuyele  kundalashe.
Iinkedama mazingosuli  umsuli  weenyembezi  zabo.  Ukuba  abazali  basweleke
phantsi kwesiphi na isiganeko, ayingombuzo ngeli xesha. Mna ke Sihlalo,  uza
kundixolela ukuba ndithe  ekuthetheni  kwam  ndahamba  ndankenenkene.  Ndiza
kube ndisenziwa yinto yokuba mna ndakhula ndingenabo abazali.  Andilwazi  ke
olu thando lomzali sithetha ngalo apha,  kwaye  ke  kuluxanduva  lwam  ukuba
ndisolule isandla ukuze abanye  abantwana  abakhulayo  bangakhuli  ngendlela
mna endakhula  ngayo.  Mandiwubulele  umbutho  weAfrican  National  Congress
owenzileyo  ukuba  neenkedama  zikwazi  ukuma  apha,  zize   kumela   uluntu
olungenato. Umanyano kumakhaya ethu lwenza  igalelo  ekukhuseleni  abantwana
bethu kwizikrelemnqa nakwiintswelaboya. Isizwe  esitshutshisekileyo  sisizwe
esikhulisa ngononophelo ihlumelo laso.

Sihlalo obekekileyo, ukufundisa ngokhuseleko ezindleleni  kumgaqo  wesikolo,
linyathelo elikhulu. Le mfundiso  ifakelela  yonke  imiba   ejongene  nokuba
abantwana  bawazi  amalungelo  abo  ezindleleni,  iindawo  amabawele   kuzo,
iindlela  eyamkelekileyo  yesinxibo,  sinxibo  eso  siza  kukhanyisa   umntu
esekude, wena wazi inyibiba. Iziko loqeqesho  lwamagosa  endlela,  lincedisa
abantwana  kuba  le  nto  bayiva  ithethwa  ngokhuseleko   bafumana   ithuba
lokuyenza ngqo. Kungeli xesha apho eli Sebe lezoThutho  liqeqesha  abantwana
abangama-15 000, abaqinisekisayo ukuba izigidi ezibini zabantwana  besikolo,
zikhuselekile xa besiya naxa bebuya  esikolweni.  Mandimbulele  uMphathiswa,
uGqirha uSkweyiya  othe  ngotyelelo  lwakhe  eHeshele,  apho  ndisuka  khona
eSterkspruit, sawubona umahluko. Usincedise ukuba kungabikho  mntwana  ulala
engatyanga. Nasezibhedlele sithetha nje asinaye umntwana olaliselwe  ingozi.
Linyathelo elikhulu ke elo.

Kubhaliwe phaya kwiincwadi ezingcwele ukuba 'Bavumeleni abantwana beze  kum,
kuba ubukumkani bamazulu  bobabo'.  Utsho  njalo  ke  uRhulumente  okhokelwa
yiAfrican National Congress.

Mandibulele  Sihlalo,  ndimbulele  nomntu  otolikayo  phaya  phezulu,  ngoba
uyenza ibe lula into yokuba ndizidle ngolwimi lwam. Enkosi.  [Kuyaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

Ms P C P MAJODINA: I would like to greet you, Chairperson, hon  Minister  Dr
Skweyiya and my colleagues who are in this House.

I am moved by the opportunity afforded to  me  today  to  be  one  of  those
participating in such an important debate. This  gives  me  as  a  parent  a
responsibility to respect, protect and fulfil children's rights,  as  stated
in the Children's Bill of Rights. A happy child is a child who comes from  a
happy home, from protective and dignified parents. A child  who  is  brought
up in a violent home, does not know the joys and  realities  of  life.  That
child does not know about respect. That child grows up to be a very  violent
person, a confrontational person. The love that a child  gets  at  home  and
from the society plays a big role in moulding him or her. Clause  9  of  The
Freedom Charter of 1995 says, "All people  shall  have  the  right  to  live
where they choose, be decently housed, and to bring  up  their  families  in
comfort and security". No one shall close the door and go to  sleep  without
food. That is the reason that the Government is fulfilling  its  promise  by
giving children and  families  houses.  It  does  not  discriminate  against
single mothers. One has a right to be given a house by  this  Government  so
that one can bring ones's children up in a dignified manner, the  way  I  am
now doing with my two  sons,  Mkhonto  weSizwe  and  Siqhamo  sothando.  The
clause goes on to say, Chairperson,  "Slums  shall  be  demolished  and  new
suburbs built where  all  have  accessible  and  secured  public  transport,
roads, lighting, playing fields, crèches and social centres".

Chairperson, I would like to emphasise that my child  is  your  child;  your
child  is  my  child.  What  is  uncomfortable  for  your  child  should  be
uncomfortable for mine too. All in all we should feel for  each  other.  Let
us go back to the old ways. Orphans should not be asked questions about  how
the parents died.  That  is  not  a  question  that  should  be  posed  now.
Chairperson, I would like to apologise because I may show signs of  weakness
and shed a few tears. That is because I grew up without  my  parents.  I  do
not know this parental love we are talking about here today, and  it  is  my
responsibility to extend my hand so that small kids may not grow up the  way
I did. I would like to extend a vote  of  thanks  to  the  African  National
Congress for having given orphans, people like  myself,  an  opportunity  to
stand here and be the mouthpiece of the have-nots.  Unity  in  our  families
contributes towards  the  protection  of  our  children  from  criminals.  A
perfect nation is the  one  that  takes  care  of  the  development  of  its
generations.

Chairperson, including lessons about road safety in  the  school  curriculum
is a step in the right  direction.  That  kind  of  education  includes  all
matters pertaining to children's rights  on  the  road,  where  they  should
cross, the correct dress code that which will make sure that  a  person  can
be seen from afar at night, just like a white lily. The training centre  for
traffic officers is assisting children as they get  to  practice  what  they
hear about road safety. The Department of Transport is at this  very  moment
teaching 15 000 whose role is to make sure that two million school  children
are safe on their way to and from school. I would  like  to  thank  the  hon
Minister Dr Skweyiya who, through his  visits  to  Herschel,  which  is  the
place where I was born, made a difference. He helped us see to  it  that  no
child goes to sleep without food. Even at our hospitals, there is  no  child
that has been admitted because of a road accident. That is a very big step.

It is written in the Bible, ``Let the children come to  me.  Do  not  forbid
them, for the Kingdom of God is for such as these.'' The ANC-led  Government
asserts.

Thank you, Chairperson, and many thanks to the interpreter who is making  it
easier for me to be proud of my language.

Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr J O  TLHAGALE:  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  this  honourable
Chamber, the  topic  under  discussion  was  not  readily  clear  to  me.  I
struggled to come to terms with  it.  However,  it  became  clear  that  the
central issue is the rights of the child which, in terms of the topic,  must
be respected, protected, promoted and fulfilled.

I, and a few colleagues  in  this  House,  emerged  from  an  era  in  which
children did not have any rights or their  rights  were  not  recognised  at
all. The general practice at  that  time  was  that  children  must  not  be
pampered or brought up as little  darlings,  as  this  practice  could  then
spoil them and turn them into weaklings.

They were to be brought up in a way that would prepare them at an early  age
for the hardships and other vicissitudes of life  in  the  world  they  were
going to live in. Rights were an unknown  commodity  among  children  of  my
colour. Therefore, there could not be any thought of  respecting,  promoting
and fulfilling those rights, because they could not be recognised,  and  not
being recognised was tantamount to not being there.

However, I would be less than honest if I  did  not  recognise  and  applaud
those stalwarts who fought and suffered for this democratic dispensation  in
which I, too, in the twilight of my life, can stand up  in  this  honourable
Chamber to advocate respect, protection and promotion of my  grandchildren's
rights.  Suffice  it  to  mention  also  our  gratitude  to  the  unequalled
contribution of the honourable  Nelson  Mandela  in  the  struggle  for  the
rights of all children.

Le gale fa re re ditshwanelo tsa bana di tlotlwe, di bo  di  diragadiwe,  ga
re re bana ba gagoge, ba senyege, ba bo ba itirele boithatelo. Ga re  rialo.
Re bolela gore bana ke madi a rona mme ba tshwanetse go ratwa.  Ba  seka  ba

petelelo tse re di utlwelang, badiri ba tsona  ba  ineelela  bomadimabe  jwa
leruri. [Legofi.] (Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[Mr J O TLHAGALE: Even if we say that the rights of the children  should  be
respected, we are  not  saying  that  they  should  be  ill-disciplined,  be
spoilt, and do as they please. We are not saying that. We  are  saying  that
children are our blood and should be loved. They should not  be  abused.  We
should understand that girls are  our  future  mothers,  and  boys  are  our
future fathers. These evil deeds of rape that we hear of,  those  who  carry
them out wish themselves eternal bad luck. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, it has been an  honour  and
a privilege to participate in this debate today, specifically in  this  year
that has been assigned by the  President  with  a  day  for  the  child  and
anointed as the year of the child.

In South Africa we have, through our Constitution, put  the  children  first
in order to be at  the  centre  of  all  our  activities,  individually  and
collectively. This is a demand that is made of all of  us  individually  and
as communities. The majority of us here come  from  families  that  are  not
very rich.  The  majority  of  these  families  are  very,  very  poor.  The
communities from which we come are the communities that  are  suffering  and
have suffered. This is the cause of our presence here  today,  in  order  to
continue that struggle to make life better than it was for us. Children  are
central in that respect.

In almost all the provinces I visited, the essence of  the  issue  was  that
there was a lot of suffering,  unemployment  and  malnutrition  in  all  our
communities. The people who suffer most are women and children, and,  as  we
discuss today respect for the protection and promotion of the rights of  the
child, we should have that at  the  back  of  our  minds.  This  is  not  an
academic question. It is a reality that exists in our societies today.

Last week on Saturday - before yesterday - we were in Mount Frere. The  week
before that we were in Umzimkulu in the Eastern Cape in order  to  look,  in
general, at how we we can raise the standards of life of the  children  and,
more importantly, of all the communities that live in those areas.

It is a reality that there are children who die because of  malnutrition  in
our country. We do not have to run away  from  that  fact.  In  fact,  in  a
country as rich as ours, each and every one of us ought to be a  little  bit
ashamed that this does happen, because we do have  the  necessary  resources
as a country to reach out to those children, to make South Africa  a  better
place for them than it was for us.

It is a  reality,  currently,  in  South  Africa  that  Aids  is  decimating
thousands of our people,  and  the  people  who  suffer  the  most  are  the
children left behind fatherless and motherless, the orphans who run  through
the streets of our country. It behoves us as communities and as  individuals
to do something about that. I want to say again: This cannot be a thing,  an
issue, that should be left to Government alone.  This  cannot  be  an  issue
that should be left to the  parents  alone,  although  the  parents  have  a
central role to play, and the communities are things that all of us have  to
be part and parcel of.

Children are the future of our country, and our Constitution  -  I  want  to
repeat - urges us to put children first and to make them central in all  our
endeavours as a country, as a people and as communities. I hope this  debate
today on the rights of the child was  not  just  a  political  and  academic
debate. All of us in our constituencies - we go back to them every  weekend,
every month or whenever we close here - should try to ensure that  each  and
every child gets, at  least,  what  he  or  she  is  entitled  to  from  the
Government.

I hope that the decision taken by the ANC policy conference - I am  sure  it
will be part and  parcel  of  the  decisions  that  will  be  taken  by  the
conference of the ANC in Stellenbosch - will  necessarily  drive  us  to  do
more to register all the children, at least up to the  present  moment,  who
are entitled to those grants, that is, children under seven years old.

This is so that when we start to reach out to children  who  are  older,  we
are able to reach every child, so that we are not called to  court  for  not
having been able to reach out to those children. I know,  even  for  me,  it
would have been an easier thing - in fact, I would have loved  it  -  if  we
were able to give each and every child of seven years and older  our  grant,
but administratively and management-wise it is not possible.

We have to register each and every child that is entitled  to  a  grant.  We
have only reached about 2,5 million children, and I am  sure  we  can  reach
the 5 million plus children who are entitled to this grant. We  should  know
exactly what we are talking about when we say that we  want  to  reach  more
children, in terms of how many children we are talking about.

This is so that we do not budget less than what  we  are  supposed  to,  not
because Government is against the whole thing, but because there is a  thing
called administration and management, as well as  budgetary  processes  that
have to be undertaken in order to be able to reach those  children  whom  we
want to reach.

It is what we want now, so that by the year 2004 we  can  say  to  each  and
every child that he or she is entitled to this, that he or she must get  it.
More importantly, I want to  appeal  to  members  of  this  Chamber  as  the
representatives, generally, of all the provinces, that there is a  nutrition
programme in each and every province -  in  each  and  every  locality  that
currently exists.

A decision was taken by Cabinet that the nutrition programme should move  to
the Department of Education - so that each and every  school  and  each  and
every community is responsible for it, because in each and  every  community
there is a school, and each and every school governing body  should  be  the
one  that  administers,  controls  and  monitors  the  nutrition  programme.
[Applause.] This is so that each and every child should have  at  least  one
meal a day - one good meal, if not two, but at least one meal, so that  when
he or she goes home, he or she is able to sleep.

I do not know whether some of you come from rich families, but there is  one
thing as a child that hits one deeply - if one has never gone through  this,
then one is very lucky - and that is to go to bed hungry and to wake up  the
following day and go back to school. And one is  expected  to  perform  like
any other child.

This is what we individually  and  collectively  have  to  ensure  does  not
happen in our lifetime in this free and democratic  South  Africa:  ensuring
that a child gets his or her own grant, ensuring in one's  own  constituency
that the nutrition programme that is there is  a  reality;  and  one  should
ensure that the money does not get sent back and rolled over  when  children
are hungry, or that somebody to whom this  has  been  outsourced  gets  rich
easily out of this.

We should monitor that individually, as members of  Parliament,  as  members
of the NCOP, as members of the legislatures or as  members  of  the  Council
and, more importantly, as civil society, as  parents,  to  ensure  that  the
programme happens, is a reality and that each  and  every  child  gets  that
money and gets involved.

With that I hope we will, at least to a certain extent, be  able  to  fulfil
those rights of the child which we have all agreed to put as central to  our
Constitution. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
The Council adjourned at 16:52.
