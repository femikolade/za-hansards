                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that  the  Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism
       assisted 227 small and medium enterprises through  the  International
       Tourism Marketing Assistance Scheme in 2001-02;


  (2)  further   notes   that   this   assistance   targeted   historically
       disadvantaged individuals and provided  them  with  opportunities  to
       market  and  profile   products   and   services   at   international
       exhibitions;


  (3) believes  that  this  reflects  the  ANC  Government's  endeavour  to
       transform the tourism industry and create jobs through tourism; and


  (4) commends the ANC Government for transforming this sector so  that  it
       begins to reflect the population demography of our country.

[Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) advises President Mbeki to decline the invitation to visit Iraq as  a
       guest of President Saddam Hussein;


  (2) believes such  a  visit  is  inappropriate  and  could  damage  US-SA
       relations and jeopardise the benefits achieved from the Africa Growth
       and Opportunity Act;


  (3) insists that the Iraq situation must be handled within the  framework
       of international law and by means of multilateral operations; and


  (4) states that the SA Government should use its  influence  to  persuade
       Iraq to comply with UN resolutions and encourage the UN to  speed  up
       the weapons inspection process so that the issue  of  Saddam  Hussein
       and weapons of mass  destruction  can  be  resolved  without  further
       delay.

Prince N E ZULU: Chair, I hereby give notice that at  the  next  sitting  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the proposal by  the  Employment  Conditions  Commission  in
       respect of the wage systems for farm workers in South Africa as  this
       sector is the most vulnerable to exploitation and some  workers  earn
       as little as R100 per month;


  (2) recognises the intentions of  the  commission  to  treat  workers  in
       poorer areas separately from those in affluent areas in terms of wage
       packages and accommodation;


  (3) recommends that the department's viewpoint be taken  into  cognisance
       by the commission in order to strike a single determination  for  all
       farm workers in South Africa; and


  (4) calls on Labour's big minds to  aim  higher  than  the  present  wage
       levels in  order  to  liberate  farm  workers  from  the  scourge  of
       starvation wages they have endured all their lives.

Mr S K LOUW: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

       consideration the preservation of the environment;


  (2) further notes that a plan has been developed to preserve bird life in
       the area;


  (3) believes that -


       (a)  this reflects the ANC Government's commitment to preserving  our
           environment through sustainable development; and


       (b)  is a further demonstration of  our  Government's  commitment  to
           implementing the resolutions of the World Summit on  Sustainable
           Development; and


  (4) commends the ANC Government for  embarking  on  programmes  aimed  at
       facilitating sustainable development and preserving the environment.

  That the House -


  (1) takes note of the overwhelming success of the federal congress of the
       New NP that was held this past weekend in Johannesburg;
[Interjections.];


  (2) in particular notes the  strong  hope-creating  and  direction-giving
       speech of the national  leader  of  the  New  NP,  Mr  Marthinus  van
       Schalkwyk, as well as the  positive  reconciliatory  address  of  the
       national chairperson of the ANC, Minister Mosiuoa Lekota; and


  (3) further notes  the  excellent  attendance  at,  and  spirit  of,  the
       congress, which clearly showed that the New NP is on the march  again
       and  is  determined,  together  with  all  other  South  Africans  of
       goodwill, to make South Africa win.

[Applause.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the  reports  of  the  Bulube  Independent  Commission  of
       Inquiry in the Eastern Cape, the Moleleki Commission  of  Inquiry  in
       the Free State, the Mabiletsa Commission of Inquiry in  the  province
       of the North West and the  Ralushai  Commission  of  Inquiry  in  the
       Province of Limpopo, which were appointed by the respective  premiers
       in these provinces to investigate the disputes, claims and legitimacy
       of traditional leadership, were not  released  by  the  premiers  and
       tabled in  Parliament  by  the  Minister  for  Provincial  and  Local
       Government;


  (2) is appalled at the refusal of the premiers to release the reports  in
       spite of the constitutional provision that all organs  of  state  are
       obliged to furnish the  required  information  upon  request  by  any
       person; and

       action in an effort to force the premiers and the Minister to release

       million to Cida City campus;

       to transforming the corporate sector so as to reflect the  population
       demography of South Africa; and


  (5) welcomes the R400 million contribution made by the  corporate  sector
       to this institution.
[Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a British couple was charged R700 for a R14 ride in a Cape  Town
           minibus from Camps Bay to central Cape Town this week;


       (b)  three other South Africans in the taxi failed  to  intervene  on
           behalf of the tourists; and
       (c)  the tourists complained to Cape Town Tourism who are  attempting
           to have the money repaid;


  (2) calls upon the Government and the tourism industry to  blacklist  any
       service provider which overcharges tourists, thus creating a negative
       image of South Africa; and


 (3)  calls upon all South Africans to be vigilant and  to  intervene  when
       tourists are being overcharged in such a brazen manner.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the  next  sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the issue of the authority and role of traditional leaders
       is long overdue for attendance and final settlement;


  (2) observes the PAC view that this is not a matter that can continue  to
       be delayed and handled without the involvement of traditional leaders
       themselves and experts on this cultural aspects of African life;


  (3) believes that -


       (a)  the question  of  traditional  leaders  can  never  be  resolved
           without amending sections 211 and 212 of the Constitution; and


       (b)  any law that claims to  bestow  rights  on  traditional  leaders
           outside  the  Constitution  will  not  achieve  a   satisfactory
           solution and will only cheat them; and


  (4) appeals to the present Government not to seek  the  solution  to  the
       problem of traditional leaders through  Eurocentric  values,  but  to
       look at how countries such as Ghana, Uganda and Malaysia  dealt  with
       this important national issue.

[Time expired.] [Interjections.]

Ms N M TWALA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that South Africa, Malawi and  Swaziland  have  embarked  on  a
       joint programme to curb the spread of malaria;


  (2) believes that this demonstrates the commitment of the ANC  Government
       to fighting life-threatening diseases and to providing better  health
       care for all our people; and


  (3) congratulates the ANC Government on embarking on the joint initiative
       with other countries in the region to curb the spread of malaria.

[Applause.]

Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the DA:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with approval that the DA has launched a nationwide campaign to
       promote a basic income grant;


  (2) notes further that the grant will benefit all persons  earning  under
       R7 500 a year;


  (3) recognises that, although the amount is not large, it will  help  the
       poorest of the poor to feed their families and it is  affordable  for
       the Government; and


  (4) expresses the hope that the ANC will change its policy and accept the
       DA proposal by instituting  a  basic  income  grant  without  further
       delay.
[Applause.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


     That the House -


     (1)    notes with concern the sentence given to a 39-year-old  Richwood
         man charged with sexually molesting an eight-year-old  girl  during
         2000 and 2001;


     (2)    further notes that the accused has been sentenced to 16 hours of
         community service a month for three  years  and  to  six  years  in
         prison, conditionally suspended for five years;


     (3)    believes that the accused was given a lenient  sentence,  taking
         into consideration the number of paedophile cases  in  the  country
         over the past few years; and


     (4)    appeals to the justice system to review  its  sentences  with  a
         view to effectively addressing this problem of the sexual abuse  of
         children.

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the SA Police Service has arrested Mr Thomas Vogel Vorster
       for his involvement in a plot to overthrow the Government;


  (2) further notes that the SAPS has also released a list containing names
       of people who are positively linked to a spate of bombings in  Soweto
       recently;


  (3) believes that the SAPS has made an  important  breakthrough  in  this
       investigation and will bring the perpetrators of these criminal  acts
       to book;
  (4) welcomes the arrest of all those involved in a plot to overthrow  the
       Government;


  (5) expresses its support for the SAPS on the progress made in this case;
       and


  (6) calls on all South Africans to work with the police in ensuring  that
       these fugitives are brought to book.

[Applause.]

Mr J W LE ROUX: Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek  met  die  volgende
sitting van die Huis namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis-


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat die Nuwe NP Kaapstad gelukwens met sy  status
       as die nommer een toerismebestemmming ter wêreld;


  (2) glo die inwoners van Kaapstad moet sorg  dra  dat  hierdie  prestasie
       hulle tot nog groter suksesse sal aanspoor;


  (3) meen dat toerisme  in  Suid-Afrika  benadeel  word  deur  gewetenlose
       swendelaars wat besoekers skaamteloos uitbuit;


  (4) daarvan kennis neem dat 'n  Britse  egpaar  verlede  week  R700  moes
       betaal vir 'n taxirit wat normaalweg R14 kos; en


  (5) 'n beroep op die toerisme-owerheid doen om onmiddellik die  skuldiges
       wat aan hulle bekend is, te vervolg en sorg te dra dat  die  betrokke
       egpaar vir hul skade vergoed word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the New NP congratulates Cape Town on its  status  as  the
       number one tourist destination in the world;


  (2) believes that the residents of Cape Town should make sure  that  this
       achievement urges them on to even greater success;


  (3) feels that tourism in South Africa is being  harmed  by  unscrupulous
       swindlers who shamelessly exploit visitors;


  (4) notes that last week a British couple had to pay R700 for a taxi ride
       which normally costs R14; and


  (5) appeals to the  tourism  authorities  to  immediately  prosecute  the
       guilty parties who are known to them,  and  ensure  that  the  couple
       concerned will be compensated for their loss.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting of the House, I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the UDM differs with the comments made by the Group of  63
       on the Soweto bombings, because the UDM believes there is  no  excuse
       for those despicable acts;


  (2) believes that the only thing that the Group of 63 succeeded in  doing
       was painting all Afrikaners into a corner with them, and  that  their
       comments seem like nothing more than the justification  of  senseless
       violence by a small group of confused criminals who produce  academic
       excuses to justify their actions;


  (3) resolves that the solution for South Africa's problems  can  only  be
       found in non racial teamwork; and


  (4) believes that the Group  of  63  should  become  part  of  mainstream
       politics.

                  CONGRATULATIONS TO SA WOMEN'S HOCKEY TEAM
                   AND SA CRICKET TEAM ON THEIR VICTORIES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the South African women's hockey team which beat one of
       the top teams in the world, the Netherlands, by winning the series 2-
       1;


  (2) recognises the significance of their achievement and  the  hard  work
       that has brought them this victory;


  (3) congratulates the  South  African  cricket  team  which  clinched  an
       emphatic win over Sri Lanka in the first test of the series,  beating
       them by an innings and 64 runs; and


  (4) believes that the Proteas are on track to triumph in  the  World  Cup
       tournament to be held in South Africa in 2003.

Agreed to.

              NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Chairperson, it was during the period of 21 to  25
May 2002 when 800 young children between the ages of 10 and 12  gathered  in
British Columbia, Canada, for an international environmental  conference  in
co-operation with the United Nations Environment Programme.

South Africa was also represented, and not only was the representative  from
the North West province, but our 10-year-old was a tiny little  girl  called
Kefiloe from Mailakhang School. It excites me particularly  to  witness  the
progress of the girl-child today. Kefiloe went on  a  plane  for  the  first
time.  Apparently  this  was  also  the  first  time  she  saw  Johannesburg
International Airport, and she came back more dynamic and committed  in  her
fight against the degradation of the environment.

She appeals to those of us who can legislate  not  to  forget  the  Bill  of
Rights in our Constitution, and not to forget that she is  a  future  parent
who needs to bring up her children  in  a  clean  and  harmless  environment
which hon members and I have made the birthright of all South  Africans.  We
dare not fail her.

I, Kefiloe and many members  in  this  House  still  live  in  poverty,  but
unsustainable means of addressing poverty will never  help  us.  Eradicating
poverty  is  the  greatest  challenge  facing  the  world   today   and   an
indispensable requirement  for  sustainable  development,  particularly  for
developing countries such as South Africa. Our  country  cannot,  therefore,
afford the unsustainable exploitation of its environment.

We need to ensure that our environment is protected at all  times  in  order
to encourage economic development and  poverty  eradication.  The  ANC  has,
with the tabling and subsequent  enactment  of  the  National  Environmental
Management Act, Nema, clearly illustrated the weight it lends to the  proper
protection  and  management  of  the  environment,  as  prescribed  in   our
Constitution.

Nema has, in many ways, altered environmental  protection  in  South  Africa
for the better. Its sweeping powers and far-reaching influence have  already
averted  many  a  potential  environmental  disaster.  However,  as  can  be
expected from such a  comprehensive,  involved  Act,  it  was  by  no  means
intended to be the last and absolute oracle.

Although it is envisaged that all environmental legislation will  ultimately
be consolidated in Nema, its growth - as should be the case in its  teething
years within our young and vibrant democracy - is by no means complete.

This  House  today  plays  witness  to  the  first  amending  Bill  to  this
cornerstone  of  South  African  legislation.  This  Bill  clarifies  beyond
reasonable  doubt  Government's  intention  to   protect   our   environment
zealously.

Today few people  would  argue  the  interdependence  and  importance  of  a
harmonious osmosis between conservation and  human  development.  Long  gone
are the days when fences around conservation  areas  were  erected  to  keep
people out rather than protected species in.

The protection and conservation of  our  natural  treasures  should  at  all
times take place against the background of  making  them  accessible  to  as
many South Africans as possible in  order  to  derive  pride,  pleasure  and
personal growth from them.

However, having said that, the fundamental difference  between  exploitation
for positive, constructive purposes  and  the  destructive  exploitation  of
nature should always be borne in mind.

I am proud to announce that there has been consensus among  all  parties  in
the portfolio committee on the adoption of  this  Bill  without  amendments,
and I am very proud of the portfolio committee in that regard.

Government has a constitutional  obligation  to  guard  against  destructive
forms of exploitation of our natural resources. One  of  the  principles  of
sustainable development, namely  ``Some  for  all  forever''  should  always
apply if we are to ensure that  our  future  generations  are  afforded  the
opportunity to enjoy our God-given natural resources.

South Africa is host to 3 000 kilometres of arguably the most beautiful  and
pristine coastline in the world. Its enormous tourism  potential  has  again
been underlined by the fact that South Africa has  been  identified  as  the
fastest growing tourist destination globally.

However, as the House is well aware, our  real  interest  does  not  lie  in
accolades like that one, but much more in what this translates into in  real
terms for those who have been deprived of so much for far too long.

I must pause to have some water.  [Interjections.]  With  the  experience  I
have, I can time my speeches very well. Hon members must not worry.

The potential to generate income for people in deep rural areas  contributes
significantly to restoring a sense of self-worth and  dignity  to  many  who
have given up on ever  seeing  their  impoverished  lives  changes  for  the
better, and far outweighs fancy titles and flashy accolades.

It is our obligation to turn this potential into real jobs  for  our  people
and to ensure the improvement of their  lives  for  the  better.  We  cannot
allow the environment to be exploited  for  the  pleasure  of  the  affluent
members of our society and to the detriment of those in need.

It is for this reason that Government has been urging  communities  to  join
hands in partnerships  aimed  at  realising  the  vision  of  a  sustainable
environment that provides ``Some for all forever''.

The success  of  Government's  efforts  in  fulfilling  this  constitutional
obligation is critically dependent on  such  partnerships.  This  will  make
little Kefiloe very proud.

Coming from a history of exclusion and nepotism, any  argument  against  the
protection of the environment is an argument in favour of selfish  arrogance
for which there is no place  in  our  country  today.  It  is  my  pleasure,
therefore, to report to  the  House  that  South  Aricans  are  increasingly
heeding  Government's  call  to  join  in  the   fight   for   environmental
protection.

A case in point is the Cleanest Town Competition which was launched  by  the
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism last year and which  saw  an
increasing number of people taking an  interest  in  their  environment  and
helping to clean their cities and towns.

November has been declared National Environment Month, again  with  the  aim
of encouraging South Africans  to  forge  a  closer  relationship  with  the
environment, while highlighting the socioeconomic benefits of  environmental
protection and management.

The national Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and  provincial
governments are hosting various activities all around the country.  I  would
like to urge  our  people  to  join  these  activities  and  begin  to  take
individual responsibility for their environment, for their own sake and  for
that of future generations.

The spirit and context of the National  Environmental  Management  Act  have
been very clear  from  the  outset:  to  protect  our  common  environmental
heritage in order to facilitate  a  harmonious  existence  between  man  and
nature to the ultimate benefit of both.

I therefore trust that this House will support  the  National  Environmental
Management Amendment Bill unanimously. [Applause.]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Chairperson, the purpose  of  this  Bill  is  to  remove  any
uncertainty which might exist as to the Minister's  authority  to  introduce
measures for the prevention of environmental degradation under the  National
Environmental Management Act.

The Bill has in some circles become known as ``the 4 X 4 Bill''. The  reason
for this is because of the controversy which has arisen over the  Minister's
stated intention of enacting legislation through Nema to control the  access
of off-road vehicles to marine environments.

This, of course, is not the only  restricting  piece  of  legislation  which
will, in due course, be  introduced  through  Nema  in  order  to  prohibit,
restrict or control activities which are  likely  to  impact  negatively  on
South Africa's precious environment. It is, however, a restriction that  has
caused a great deal of concern and  anger  amongst  those  who  have  become
accustomed to free access to beaches in their 4 X 4 vehicles.

Much of the opposition to the proposed restrictions has arisen as  a  result
of the misconception that there will be a  blanket  ban  on  access  to  all
beaches. This is, of course, not the case. Provision, in certain  instances,
will be made for access under strictly controlled conditions.  The  reckless
destruction of our beaches by irresponsible elements in our society must  be
stopped. All true conservationists should welcome this development.

The DA supports this Bill as it will support any legislation which  advances
acceptable  and  reasonable  measures  to  preserve  our  irreplaceable  and
fragile natural environment. [Applause.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson, hon members, this  Bill  seeks  to  amend  the
principal act, the  National  Environmental  Management  Act,  in  order  to
provide for measures to prohibit, restrict or control activities  which  are
likely to have a detrimental effect on the environment.

The IFP will support the amendment, but we want to raise the  issue  of  the
St Lucia wetland. The St Lucia wetland is a rural  region,  well  known  for
its tropical natural features. It is a World Heritage Site  with  ecological
diversity and scenic beauty. The wetland has the  attraction  of  ecotourism
and recreational fishing, drawing a substantial number of seasonal  visitors
each  year,  but  the  region  is  also   characterised   by   poverty   and
unemployment.

The issue of a 4 X 4 ban in this area is  high  on  the  agenda.  Currently,
this has affected both the users of 4 X 4 vehicles  and  those  residing  in
the area who get part-time jobs from the users of the 4 X 4s.

Hon members will wonder why I wanted to give this background information.

Okokuqala ngifisa ukusho ukuthi abantu laphaya bakhathazekile  ngalokhu.  I-
IFP  iyakweseka  ukuchitshiyelwa  kwalo  mthetho.  Kodwa  sifuna   ukunikeza
isendlalo ngokwenza laphaya. Zintathu izinto,  uMnyango  ilungiselela  ukuba
kuvikeleke imvelo. Kulungile,  sonke  siyakuvuma  lokho,  imvelo  ayivikelwe
ngayo yonke indlela. Kodwa-ke  kukhona  laba  bantu  abayizivakashi  ezifika
ngama-four-by-four, bazokwenza  noma  yikuphi  abakuzele,  okungaba  ukudoba
noma  yini  enye  laphaya  eSt  Lucia,  ebesengichazile  ukuthi  ikhungethwe
ububhwa nendlala nakho konke. Okukhulu-ke  ukuthi  laba  abafikayo,  abadobi

paragraphs follows.)

[Firstly, I would like to say that the people out  there  are  worried.  The
IFP will support the amendment of this Act, but we want to  give  background
information on  what  is  happening  there.  There  are  three  things.  The
department wants to protect the environment. That  is  fine.  We  all  agree
with that. The environment must be protected at all  costs,  but  there  are
tourists who visit there with 4 X 4s. They come to fish or  to  do  anything
they like in St Lucia which, as I explained, is suffering from poverty.

The important thing is that these people who come to fish and  to  do  other
things - and with 4 X 4s - are saying that it is  better  to  go  to  Maputo
because there is no restricting legislation there, like here. Yes, St  Lucia
is a World Heritage Site which must be protected by all the  rules,  but  we
should state people's views as they are presented to us.

We went there with my colleague the hon Mampe.  When  we  got  there  people
said: ``We ourselves are the environment, but it seems as  if  only  animals
and plants are protected. It seems as if the department does not care  about
us.'' What I am saying here is that people are saying  they  themselves  are
the environment. They are the environment, although  it  seems  as  if  this
term refers only to animals, plants, birds and other species, not  to  them.
They feel that they are not afforded the protection we  are  talking  about.
Another thing is that tourists are going to Maputo, which  means  they  will
leave this area, the St  Lucia  wetland.  They  will  leave  the  people  in
poverty there.]

In conclusion, I would like to  say  that  the  environment  is  a  national
asset. The coast must be retained  as  a  national  asset  with  the  public
having the right to access the benefits of the many  opportunities  provided
by the coastal resources. Co-operative government and  partnerships  between
Government, the private sector and civil society must be built in  order  to
ensure that there is co-responsibility of coastal management and to  empower
stakeholders to participate effectively.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the noise level  is  very
high. If we do  not  get  your  co-operation,  we  shall  suspend  business,
because the noise makes it very difficult for  those  members  who  want  to
listen to the debate. There are too many private meetings going on.

Mnr   J   W   LE   ROUX:   Voorsitter,   die   Nuwe   NP   ondersteun    die
Wysigingswetsontwerp   op   Nasionale   Omgewingsbestuur.   Daar   sal   nou
regsekerheid wees deurdat die Wet uitdruklik voorsiening maak vir  maatreëls
om aktiwiteite wat waarskynlik die omgewing  kan  benadeel  te  verbied,  te
beperk of te beheer. Die standpunt van die Nuwe NP  was  deurgaans  dat  ons
nie mag toelaat dat ons strande verder deur voertuie verniel mag word nie.

Die regulasie wat die gebruik van  voertuie  op  strande  reguleer  is  baie
duidelik, en daar word voorsiening gemaak vir sport en  ontspanningsgebruike
met dien verstande dat geen verdere beskadiging op strande geduld  sal  word
nie.

Die vordering wat die afgelope aantal jare op die gebied van  natuurbewaring
gemaak is,  is  verblydend  en  ons  behoort  almal  saam  te  werk  om  ons
natuurlike erfenis te beskerm. Die Nuwe NP bring hulde  aan  mense  soos  dr
Anton Rupert, dr Ian Player, Ton Vosloo, groot sakeondernemings,  stadsrade,
staatsdepartemente en veral Minister Valli Moosa wat groot  bydraes  gelewer
het om natuurbewaring te bevorder.

Daar is talle voorbeelde van individue, veral in  die  landbougeledere,  wat
besondere bydraes gelewer het wat bewaring betref. Hierdie  bewaringspogings
het tot volg dat natuurbewaring in Suid-Afrika  sy  regmatige  status  begin
kry.  Die  herstel  van  ons  visbronne,  die  toename  in  wildtroppe,  die
vergroting van ons parke en wildernisgebiede, die aanplanting  van  inheemse
bome en die vordering wat met die bekamping van rommel gemaak word, is  baie
positief.

Natuurlik is daar nog ernstige probleme, maar belangstelling  van  die  breë
publiek in die bewaring van ons erfenis, is 'n belangrike stap in die  regte
rigting. Daar is net nie meer plek in Suid-Afrika vir selfsugtige mense  wat
ons  natuur  beskadig  nie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr  J  W  LE  ROUX:  Chairperson,  the  New  NP   supports   the   National
Environmental Management Amendment Bill. There will now  be  legal  security
as the Bill specifically makes provision for measures to  forbid,  limit  or
control activities that can probably harm the environment. The  position  of
the New NP has always  been  that  we  can  not  allow  our  beaches  to  be
destroyed by vechicles any further.

The regulation which regulates the use  of  vehcicles  on  beaches  is  very
clear and provision is made for sport and recreational activities, with  the
provision that no further damage to beaches will be tolerated.

The progress that has been made with regard to  nature  conservation  during
the past couple of years,  is  gladdening  and  all  of  us  ought  to  work
together to protect our natural heritage. The New NP pays homage  to  people
like Dr Anton  Rupert,  Dr  Ian  Player,  Ton  Vosloo,  big  business,  town
councils, government departments and especially  Minister  Valli  Moosa  who
greatly contributed to the promotion of nature conservation.
There are many examples  of  individuals,  especially  in  the  agricultural
field,  who   made   particular   contributions   to   conservation.   These
conservation efforts led to the  fact  that  nature  conservation  in  South
Africa is beginning to get the status it deserves. The recovery of our  fish
resources, the increase in game, die enlargement of our parks and  wildernis
areas, the cultivation of indigenous trees and the progress  that  has  been
made with the fight against litter are very positive.

Of course there  still  are  serious  problems,  but  the  general  public's
interest in the conservation of our heritage is an  important  step  in  the
right direction. In South Africa there simply is no more  room  for  selfish
people who damage our environment. [Applause.]]

Prof L M MBADI: Chair, the Marine and Coastal  Management  Programme  guides
the development and conservation of the marine and coastal environment,  and
ensures the sustainable utilisation of marine and coastal resources.

Section  24(b)  of  our  Constitution  requires  that  the  environment   be
protected  for  the  benefit  of  present  and  future  generations  through
reasonable legislative and other measures. To  this  end,  regulations  were
promulgated in  December  2001  to  protect  the  coastal  environment  from
degradation and to ensure the safety of the people  enjoying  themselves  on
the coast. A general ban was imposed on the use of vehicles on  beaches  for
recreational purposes.

It has, however, become necessary to amend the Bill so  as  to  provide  for
the prohibition, restriction or control of activities which  are  likely  to
have a detrimental effect on the environment.

The amendment takes effect  retrospectively  from  the  date  on  which  the
principal Act took effect, as provided for in terms of section  35(3)(l)  of
the Constitution.

As a consequence of our protection of the beaches, a number of  our  beaches
have been awarded international blue-flag  status.  This  attests  to  their
quality and boosts local tourism.

Phambili sebe lezendalo nokhenketho! [Forward, Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism!]

The UDM supports the amending Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairman, the advent  of  the  four-wheel  drive  vehicle  has
opened up remote and fragile areas that were previously inaccessible. It  is
imperative that the fragile coastal zone  with  its  rare  plants,  animals,
birds and intertidal marine life is protected. It is for  this  reason  that
the ACDP supports this amending Bill.

What  I  would  just  like  to  touch  on  is  the  issue  related  to   the
retrospectivity of the  Bill.  Now,  a  retrospective  amendment  containing
offenses  would  normally  be  in  breach  of  section   35(3)(l)   of   the
Constitution, which constitutionally enshrines  the  legal  doctrine  nullum
crimen sine lege - a person cannot be convicted for an offence that was  not
an offence at the time it was committed. Consequently, a  proviso  has  been
added that the retrospective application of this  Act  is  made  subject  to
section 35(3)(l) to protect those persons.

So, in this regard the ACDP will support this Bill  as  it  makes  provision
for the doctrine nullum crimen sine lege.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, it  is  our  duty  not  only  to  protect  our
people, but also our environment. Also, by protecting  our  environment,  we
would then be protecting our people and, in a way, killing  two  birds  with
one stone.

South Africa has a beautiful natural environment, and such beauty  needs  to
be preserved. However, in this  day  and  age  technology-driven  mechanisms
make work easier, abandoning the duties that were previously done by hand.

Though industry has gained extensively through technology,  our  environment
has suffered a lot. The many forms of pollution  which  our  environment  is
subjected  to  do  not  only  destroy  our  natural  inhabitants,  but   are
detrimental to the health of all civilisation.

The MF supports the department for putting in  place  provisions  that  will
protect our environment  from  degradation.  This  responsibility,  however,
stretches beyond Government to all sectors, public  and  private,  and  more
specifically to the individual.

The MF supports the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs R A NDZANGA: Chairperson, hon members and hon  Minister,  we  have  just
concluded the biggest ever conference in Johannesburg,  the  United  Nations
World Summit on Sustainable Development.

After a  long  debate  on  what  sustainable  development  means,  the  term
``sustainable development'' was defined in 1983 by the World  Commission  on
Environment and Development, commonly known as the WCED.  The  WCED  defined
sustainable development as ``meeting the needs  of  the  present  generation
without compromising the ability of future generations  to  meet  their  own
needs''.

Sustainable development calls for the improvement of  the  quality  of  life
for all the world's people, without increasing the depletion of our  natural
resources beyond the earth's carrying capacity.

In order to build a sustainable way of  life,  action  is  required  in  the
following three areas: one, in economic  development  and  equity;  two,  in
conserving natural resources and  the  environment;  and  three,  in  social
development.

The amending Bill we have in front  of  us  today  addresses  the  issue  of
conserving natural resources such as dunes  and  the  environment.  I  would
like to say to the Minister that the Environment Conservation  Act  of  1989
established the  framework  for  national  legislation  concerned  with  the
controlling of off-road vehicles on the road.

Although  this  piece  of  legislation  clearly  stated  the  importance  of
acquiring a permit for such  activities  and  the  areas  within  which  the
vehicles may drive, owing to the seclusion  of  many  of  these  areas  some
drivers chose to ignore these conditions and continued unperturbed, much  to
the detriment of our coastline.

We owe it to our children to look  after  the  environment.  If  we  do  not
conserve what we have, we will lose it and, more importantly, we shall  have
betrayed generations to come.

The ANC supports the amending Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson,  let  me  at
the outset express my gratitude to the portfolio committee and  to  all  the
political parties for having supported this important amending Bill.

This is an interesting situation  that  has  arisen.  This  legislation  was
initially made by ministerial proclamation some time ago when I  gazetted  a
proclamation outlawing the willy-nilly driving of vehicles on  our  beaches.
I then came to Parliament and said: Are you prepared to amend  the  Bill  in
order that the legislation which was made by the  Minister  would  have  the
status of having been made by Parliament? All the parties readily agreed  to
do this.

I think that the message which is being sent  out  to  the  people  of  this
country, particularly to those who have a disregard for the environment  and
who insist that they have a right  to  drive  their  vehicles  in  sensitive
ecosystems, particularly beaches, is that  every  party  in  Parliament  and
every elected representative of the people of South Africa is  at  one  when
we say that people should not be allowed to wreck  our  beaches  by  driving
their vehicles on those beaches.

Every party, that is the ANC, the Democratic Alliance, the New NP, the  UDM,
the ACDP, the MF - all of us - are  at  one  with  wanting  to  protect  our
environment, and those ruffians who insist on driving their bakkies  on  the
beaches have no place in this country.

Of course, the legislation, as did the  original  proclamation,  does  allow
for certain exemptions.  We  will  grant  exemptions  because  it  would  be
foolish to have a law which does not allow for any exemptions. For  example,
disabled persons should be allowed certain exemptions, as should safety  and
security personnel, scientists and researchers. For various  other  purposes
certain very carefully considered  exemptions  will  be  allowed,  including
exemptions for bona fide sporting activities, such as tournaments which  are
held under the auspices of the Department of Sport and Recreation.  I  must,
however, make it very clear that  these  exemptions  will  be  few  and  far
between. The idea of exemptions will not be to make the exception  the  rule
once again.

As far as the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park is concerned, I think the  point
which the hon  Mbuyazi  made  is  quite  important:  how  does  one  balance
economic development with the need to protect the environment? The  problem,
however, is that we have had lots of tourists and  visitors  going  to  that
part of KwaZulu-Natal for many, many years, yet that is one of  the  poorest
parts of our country. One of the lowest  household  income  indexes  can  be
found in the Maputoland area, which is in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal.

The reason for that is  because  we  are  not  getting  the  right  kind  of
tourism. We get the sort of people who drive over there  in  their  bakkies,
pitch tents in places where they should not be pitching tents and bring  all
their food from Johannesburg or wherever they come from. They do not  really
buy anything or procure anything in the area, as a result of which  they  do
not create employment. They can only create business for one of  two  corner
shops in the area from which they procure their bread, milk and  stuff  like
that.

However, if one takes Cape Town as a destination,  it  does  not  have  that
kind of tourism. People who come to Cape  Town  generally  stay  in  hotels.
They engage in the kind of tourist activities that create  quite  a  lot  of
jobs.

That is the turnaround we are trying to  create  in  the  Greater  St  Lucia
Wetland Park. We have already put out a number of sites on  tender,  and  we
hope that over the  next  few  months  we  will  be  able  to  announce  the
successful bidders so that we can actually have  hotels  and  guesthouses  -
proper tourism that brings a real income into that  area.  We  do  not  need
people to go there to wreck those beautiful  beaches  for  short-term  gain,
while in the long term we have nothing there. So this is  a  very  carefully
thought-out strategy that we have.

I thank hon members for their support. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

             CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY PARLIAMENT
              OF INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS ON CULTURAL PROPERTY
                 IN TERMS OF SECTION 231(2) OF CONSTITUTION

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Geagte Voorsitter,  dit  is  moeilik  om  jou  emosies  te
beskrywe as jy 'n besoek bring aan die Britse Museum in Londen.  Vir  my  is
dit 'n opwindende, maar terselfdertyd ook  'n  neerdrukkende  ervaring.  Die
een oomblik is jy baie dankbaar vir die voorreg om te  sien  en  te  ervaar;
die volgende oomblik raak jy erg beswaard by die wete dat daar  kinders  reg
deur die wêreld is wat nooit die voorreg sal hê om dié  besondere  kulturele
prestasies van hul eie kultuur  te  sien  nie.   (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN:  Hon  Chairperson,  it  is  difficult  to  describe  one's
emotions when visiting the  British  Museum  in  London.  To  me  it  is  an
exciting yet at the same time depressing experience. One moment one is  very
grateful for the privilege of seeing and experiencing; the next  moment  one
gets extremely depressed knowing that there are children all over the  world
who will never enjoy the  privilege  of  seeing  these  particular  cultural
achievements of their own culture.]

One moment one is walking  tall  when  looking  at  the  artefacts  of  once
powerful empires, symbols of the achievements of formidable  rulers  of  the
Assyrian, Persian, Egyptian, Grecian and Roman empires. The next moment  one
is cut down to size when one realises that the artefacts against  the  walls
are also symbols of how the mighty have fallen  -  an  illustration  of  the
ultimate insignificance of each one of  those  once  formidable  rulers  and
proud empires.

'n Britse museumervaring, die sinnelose vernietiging van Boeddhabeelde  deur
die Taliban, die huidige plundering van kultuurerfenis in  die  Demokratiese
Republiek  van  die  Kongo,  die  onverskillige  hantering   van   ons   eie
parlementêre kunsskatte en die gemak  waarmee  waardevolle  erfstukke  voete
kry uit Tuynhuis, onderstreep die belangrikheid  van  die  konvensies  onder
bespreking.  [A British Museum  experience,  the  senseless  destruction  of
statues of Buddha by the Taliban, the present  ransacking  of  the  cultural
heritage in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the  indifferent  handling
of our own parliamentary art treasures and  the  ease  with  which  valuable
heirlooms disappear from Tuynhuys, all  underscore  the  importance  of  the
conventions under discussion.]

The Statutes of the International Centre for the Study of  the  Preservation
and Restoration of Cultural Property, or Iccrom,  contribute  to  preserving
cultural heritage through five main spheres of  activity,  namely  training,
information, research, co-operation and advocacy.

While  Iccrom  is  ensuring  preservation   and   restoration,   the   Hague
Convention, managed by Unesco, assists those states that are party  to  this
convention to prevent illicit  trafficking  in  cultural  property,  to  co-
operate  with  other  states  which  have  difficulty  in  protecting  their
heritage and to take steps to educate the  public.  These  states  are  also
bound to return to other states or parties cultural property that  has  been
stolen from a museum or similar institution.

Die Demokratiese Alliansie ondersteun die aanvaarding en implementering  van
hierdie konvensies omdat ons glo dat dit  sal  bydra  tot  die  bewaring  en
uitbouing van ons kultuurerfenis. Ook hierdie erfenis is  onlosmaaklik  deel
van die kartering waarna die Speaker verwys; kartering  wat  noodsaaklik  is
vir die soeke en herbevestiging van  ons  kulturele  identiteit,  waarsonder
die legkaart van diversiteit onvoltooid sal bly  en  waarsonder  dit  elkeen
van  ons  soveel  armer  sal  laat.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[The Democratic Alliance supports the adoption and implementation  of  these
conventions  because  we  believe  that  they   will   contribute   to   the
conservation and extension of our cultural  heritage.  This  heritage,  too,
forms an integral part of the charting to which Madam Speaker has  referred,
charting which is essential for the quest  for  and  reconfirmation  of  our
cultural identity, and without this the  jigsaw  of  diversity  will  remain
unfinished, and without this it will leave each of us so much poorer.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairman, for a country like South Africa, which  has  unique
cultural properties, it is about time that we begin to give accent to  these
United Nations conventions.  In  Egypt,  in  the  early  part  of  the  last
century, British and French activity in that country stripped it of some  of
its most valuable cultural  artefacts  that  had  been  there  for  tens  of
thousands of years, so much so that today if one goes to museums  in  London
or Paris, one will find the artefacts which  were  stripped  from  Egypt  in
these museums.

If we consider also the number of museums on  the  African  continent  as  a
whole, it will come as a surprise to many of us  to  know  that  apart  from
Egypt, South Africa and a handful  of  other  countries,  very  few  of  the
museums that once existed in  Africa  are  still  there.  This  is  possibly
because of the activities of individuals who, at times  with  the  collusion
of leaders of countries, took away rare, national and priceless  assets  for
exhibition in museums elsewhere in the world.

Unesco decided that a web of laws had to be  created  in  order  to  prevent
these ancient, priceless treasures from being taken away, and, if they  were
taken away, to provide for the country  concerned  to  be  able  to  reclaim
them; to provide for countries, in times of  war,  to  be  able  to  protect
priceless treasures  themselves;  and  to  prevent  those  conducting  armed
conflict from destroying what is priceless in the world.

These conventions have been coming  into  existence  since  1954,  the  most
recent being in the 1970s. This indicates that the countries  of  the  world
are beginning to give very serious consideration to  preserving  that  which
they have inherited and  over  which  we,  as  a  people,  must  now  become
trustees in order that we can give these treasures to our  children  intact,
as we found them.

The problem also is that without the conventions being signed, South  Africa
will not have the statutory regime to be able to ensure  that  many  of  its
artefacts that have  been  removed  can  be  brought  back,  or  to  prevent
unscrupulous dealers from taking, in the blink of  an  eye,  that  which  is
valuable to some other country and without our having the means  to  reclaim
these artefacts.

Because the IFP is conscious that we really need to  preserve  artefacts  at
all costs - as I have said, we are only the trustees  -  it  supports  these
instruments and requests the department to ensure that the legislation  that
might be needed to give support to  all  of  these  conventions  comes  into
existence so that nothing extremely valuable to South  Africa  can  ever  be
lost; or, if something is lost, for us then to have the statutory  means  to
reclaim it and to restore to the nation that which belongs to the nation.

It is sad indeed that we have taken two years to bring this  to  Parliament,
but now that it is here we hope to be able to  give  impetus  to  the  moves
that were made by Unesco in this regard.

The IFP supports Iccrom and the conventions.

Mrs A VAN WYK: Chair, it is a disappointment that neither the Minister,  the
Deputy Minister or any of the other Ministers that  are  affected  by  these
conventions are here today, but I trust that one way or  another  they  will
hear the message. We gladly endorse these long-overdue conventions and  also
the Statute of the International Centre for the Study  of  the  Preservation
and Restoration of Cultural Property.

Today we heard with gratification, as my hon colleague mentioned, that  Cape
Town has been placed fifth among the 10 best places in the world  to  visit.
However, this achievement does not only relate to its natural beauty or  the
favourable exchange rate, but also to its unique cultural heritage.  Natural
beauty can be found all  over,  but  South  Africa  is  exceptional  in  the
richness of its cultural and scientific heritage in  Southern  Africa.  This
heritage needs to be looked after and used to  develop  our  people  and  to
bring in tourism revenue.

Ons het maar 'n  handjievol  verklaarde  nasionale  instellings  en  die  SA
Erfenishulpbronagentskap  het  die  verantwoordelikheid  om  na  derduisende
monumente om te sien. SAEHA het 'n voorlopige lys van kategorieë  van  onder
meer  etnografiese,   argeologiese   en   kunsmateriaal   waaraan   algemene
beskerming verleen word.

Wanneer daar egter byvoorbeeld aansoek gedoen word om  'n  uitvoerpermit  en
dit geweier word, kan daar ná ses maande  geappelleer  word  en  indien  die
geld of 'n plaaslike koper nie gevind word nie, verloor ons so 'n skat.

Erfenis moet 'n groter hap uit die Tesourie kry. Dit is nie 'n  luukse  nie.
Dit is 'n basiese  bron  van  rykdom  vir  Suid-Afrika.  Ek  wil  vandag  'n
pleidooi lewer by die staat en al drie regeringsfere dat erfenis as een  van
die topprioriteite vir ontwikkeling en benutting beskou moet  word.  Dit  is
'n ontsaglike bron wat reg onder ons neuse sit en wat ons sienderoë  toelaat
om te vergaan  deur  swak  opvoeding,  verwaarlosing,  sloping,  kortsigtige
geldgierigheid, onwettige uitvoer en diefstal. Hiervan  is  die  publiek  en
die staat nie vry te spreek nie.

Gebrek aan kapasiteit  ten  opsigte  van  erfenis  onder  amptenare  en  die
uitvoerende gesag in elke regeringsfeer moet nou dringend aangespreek  word.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follow.)

[We have but a mere handful of declared national  institutions  and  the  SA
Heritage Resource Agency has the responsibility to look after  thousands  of
monuments. SAHRA has a provisional  list  of  categories  of  among  others,
ethnographic,  archaelogical  and  art  material  which  are  given  general
protection.

However, if one, for example,  applies  for  an  export  permit  and  it  is
refused, then after six months one may appeal and if the money  or  a  local
buyer is not found, then we lose such a treasure.

Heritage should get a bigger chunk from Treasury. It is not a luxury. It  is
a basic source of wealth for South Africa. I want to plead  today  with  the
state and all three tiers of Government that our heritage must  be  seen  as
one of the  top  priorities  for  development  and  utilisation.  It  is  an
enormous source sitting right under our very  noses  and  which  we  visibly
allow  to  decay  through  poor  education,  neglect,  demolition,  avarice,
illegal exports and theft. The public and the state cannot be excluded  from
this.

Lack of capacity with  regard  to  our  heritage  among  officials  and  the
executive in each and every sphere  of  Government  needs  to  be  addressed
urgently.]

Collections in municipal care  and  even  at  universities,  are  in  severe
danger through lack of the right kind of protection, and none of  the  types
of protection will take place on the present shoestring  budgetary  approach
towards heritage and  with  the  miserly  treatment  of  people  working  in
science and heritage.

Mrs  M  A  SEECO:  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  the   mandate   of   the
International Centre for the Study of the Preservation  and  Restoration  of
Cultural Property - Iccrom - is to  improve  conditions  for  the  effective
conservation of cultural heritage resources  worldwide.  Today  heritage  is
related to other global issues, such  as  the  development  of  tourism  and
cultural identity, and is no longer a mere luxury consumer item.

Iccrom has an interesting programme designed for all of sub-Saharan  Africa,
called ``Africa 2009''. Its first  objective  is  to  better  integrate  the
conservation of immovable  cultural  heritage  into  the  large  context  of
development in Africa. One of its priorities is  to  integrate  conservation
into a process of sustainable human development.

The purpose of these conventions is to develop the principles and  standards
with regard to the transfer of ownership,  import  and  export  of  cultural
property. The states or parties to the conventions undertake  to  adopt  the
necessary measures, one, to prevent museums within their ... The UCDP  gives
this its support. [Time expired]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairman, there is no nation in the  world  which  can  stop
the manipulation of information and the tarnishing of its image if it  lacks
culture.

Epistemology is  related  to  culture.  The  loss  of  indigenous  knowledge
results in a nation becoming an imitation of others, with too many  borrowed
solutions to its problems which are irrelevant and which  do  not  meet  its
needs.

What has happened to our knowledge  of  our  ancestors  through  which  they
could identify a stone from which to make iron  tools?  Today  one  needs  a
Western university-trained geologist to  supply  this  knowledge,  knowledge
which was like drinking coffee to our ancestors.

We must not stop with the mere preservation of  African  cultural  property.
We must also have this property repatriated  from  the  museums  of  Europe.
This property includes Africa's artefacts such as the  golden  stool,  state
coronation swords, golden nuggets and jewellery, African  scripts  going  as
far back as 3000 BC and the  history  of  those  many  African  civilations,
including the first human civilisation on earth. [Time expired]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF is a firm believer in the  preservation
of culture, tradition and religion. These  factors  make  people  what  they
are. They are the very fabric of each  individual.  They  also  keep  people
together. Familiarity, common interests and beliefs make people one.

The importance of preserving these beliefs and values  is  crucial.  In  our
Constitution we have undertaken  to  protect  the  rights  of  our  persons,
cultures and religions and the freedom to  practise  these.  The  MF  firmly
supports the preservation and restoration of cultural  property.  This  will
enable the preservation of rich histories and will bring people together.

However, we have earnestly learned to respect other cultures, religions  and
beliefs that differ from our own, and in a multicultural society this  is  a
prerequisite to maintaining harmony.

The MF supports the approval by Parliament of the statutes  and  conventions
in this respect.

Ms H M MPAKA: Chairperson, hon  members,  in  international  affairs,  which
include the inculcation of a spirit of internationalism amongst our  people,
the ANC-led Government has achieved the repositioning  of  South  Africa  on
the African continent and in international forums as the principal  advocate
of African interests and as a champion of  the  development  agenda  of  the
countries of the south.

The new legislative framework, the National Heritage Resources Act,  Act  25
of 1999, accords with the White paper on Arts,  Culture  and  Heritage,  and
legislation for the protection and  management  of  places  and  objects  of
cultural significance is contained in the Act.

Accession to Unesco's  conventions  concerning  our  heritage  could  ensure
South Africa's co-operation in human rights documentation that reflects  the
close relationships between human rights  and  the  protection  of  cultural
historical wealth.

The preservation of  our  heritage  is  the  Department  of  Arts,  Culture,
Science and Technology's line function, and the acceptance of  international
legislative frameworks  will  ensure  co-operation  from  the  international
community in the restitution or repatriation of cultural  objects  to  their
countries of origin.

As part of Unesco, South Africa must realise that it  has  an  interest  in,
and ought to have notice of, foreign and  international  legal  developments
that affect rights to tangible cultural property. Loss of cultural  heritage
is avoidable and is an impoverishment,  not  only  for  the  inhabitants  of
Africa, but also for all of humankind.

Armed conflict, such as the recent conflicts in  the  Gulf  and  Yugoslavia,
has highlighted the importance of  the  Convention  for  the  Protection  of
Cultural Property in the event of armed conflict.  This  convention  is  the
charter of cultural internationalism, the idea that humanity, as opposed  to
a nation, is the interested party. Respect  for  cultural  property  is  the
obligation of both the  territorial  state  and  its  enemies  in  times  of
conflict.

The Convention on the  Means  of  Prohibiting  and  Preventing  the  Illicit
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership  of  Cultural  Property  safeguards
our heritage from being illegally exported,  amd  prohibits  the  import  of
stolen goods from museums and dealing in  stolen  goods,  as  my  colleagues
have alluded to.

This is a worldwide problem and many  valuable  cultural  objects,  such  as
religious icons and archeological  finds  are  illegally  removed.  This  is
especially important for South Africa as we have a large rock  art  heritage
and an indigenous religious systems heritage. This convention also  protects
any cultural property against theft, pillage, misappropriation or  vandalism
directed against it.

The International Centre for the Study of the Preservation  and  Restoration
of  Cultural  Property  contributes  to  the  worldwide   conservation   and
restoration of cultural property by initiating,  developing,  promoting  and
facilitating conditions for such conservation and restoration.

Iccrom exercises the following functions that will  be  of  benefit  to  all
signatories: to collect, study  and  circulate  information  concerned  with
scientific, technical and ethical issues relating to  the  conservation  and
restoration of cultural property; to  stimulate  and  co-ordinate  research,
international meetings, publications, documents, etc;  to  give  advice  and
make recommendations; to promote, provide and develop training to raise  the
level of  expertise;  and  to  encourage  initiatives  to  create  a  better
understanding of conservation and restoration.

As  a  member  state,  South  Africa  will  benefit   from   signing   these
conventions. They will  form  part  of  the  law  of  the  country  and  are
consistent with the Constitution of the Republic of South  Africa  in  terms
of section 231.

This alone reaffirms the  ANC's  commitment  to  the  struggle  for  a  more
equitable and just world order, consistent with the  Freedom  Charter  which
declares that relations amongst nations should  be  so  ordered  to  produce
peace and friendship among the nations of the world.

In conclusion, the advantages of membership of Iccrom are that South  Africa
would be entitled to appoint a Government representative who can attend  the
biennial general assembly of this organisation to propose  a  candidate  for
its council, South Africa would be  actively  involved  in  the  policy  and
programmes of Iccrom,  and  South  African  nationals  can  be  included  in
Iccrom's courses, training programmes, partnerships  and  regional  courses.
This will enable our country to play a crucial role in, and act as  a  point
of reference for, heritage conservation on the continent of Africa.

As we are all aware, the exciting political changes and  democratisation  of
South Africa highlighted that South Africa, as  part  of  the  continent  of
Africa, is increasingly becoming the hub of cultural activity. If  the  loss
of cultural heritage is not avoided, South Africa  and  all  humankind  will
certainly be the poorer.

The ANC supports these conventions. The portfolio committee recommends  that
the House approve  the  said  conventions  and  the  statutes  respectively.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I  am  informed  that  the  Minister  is  not
available.

Debate concluded.

Statutes of the International Centre for the Study of the  Preservation  and
Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) approved.

Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing  the  Illicit  Import,
Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural  Property,  14  November  1970,

Conflict (The Hague Convention) with regulations for the execution  and  the
coverence resolutions, 14 May 1954, approved.

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE FOR
                                   2001-02

Dr S C CWELE: Chairperson, the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence  has
the task of ensuring that we balance secrecy and openness in  our  oversight
function of the intelligence structures.

The committee has had fruitful interaction with the  Inspector-General,  the
Auditor-General  and  the  judge  responsible   for   issuing   orders   for
interception. We, however, did not receive any report on the  activities  of
the services and the certificates of  compliance  from  the  Office  of  the
Inspector-General. As hon members know, the  Inspector-General  resigned  on
28 February this year.

The Auditor-General raised the problem of  asset  management  and  an  asset
register for almost all the intercivilian intelligence services,  which  the
committee has taken up with the services with regular follow-ups.

The main problem raised by the committee was the unintended consequences  of
the Taxation Laws Amendment Act of 2001, which introduced  the  taxation  of
foreign allowances of the officers deployed abroad. The  committee  and  the
services are of the view that this should not  have  been  allowed,  and  we
recommend  that  it  should  be  avoided  in  future  in  order  to  prevent
disastrous consequences for our national security.

The other concern of the committee is the vagueness  about  the  body  which
will determine the funding levels of our services. This was supposed  to  be
done by the defunct evaluation committee,  and  is  currently  done  by  the
Presidential Intelligence Budget Advisory Committee - Pibac.

The committee recommends that Pibac be formalised or given a  legal  mandate
to continue to monitor the services so that they  are  adequately  resourced
to perform their core functions.
In  our  interactions  with  the  services  we  observed  that  there   were
satisfactory improvements in a number of areas, for example the  quality  of
the products, performance, discipline, a fall in the  rate  of  absenteeism,
and improvement in management and administration in general.

However, we noted that in the printed version of the report  in  Parliament,
a whole section was omitted which dealt with the SA  Secret  Service,  which
report was adopted by the committee. I would like just to quote the  section
that was omitted regarding SASS:


  ... the committee has had good interaction  with  SASS.  There  is  sound
  improvement in the management and administration matters. During the past
  financial  year  SASS  underwent  a  major  restructuring  process.   The
  objective was to reposition the organisation so as to be able to  compete
  in the international arena.


  The committee held informative briefings by the services  on  the  matter
  that related to security regionally and internationally. The policy shift
  that changed, which is in the international relations  highlighted,  were
  linked to the international events that took place in the past 12 months.
  These shifts and changes demanded us to revisit  our  own  policies  and,
  where possible, align them  with  the  requirements  of  the  service  to
  perform its core business.

The National Intelligence Agency is fulfilling  its  mandate  of  monitoring
national  security  and  as  the  custodian   of   the   counterintelligence
responsibility.  They  have  made  breakthroughs  in   the   fight   against
corruption, extremism, terrorism and gangsterism.

The defence intelligence  and  crime  intelligence  have  increasingly  been
under the scrutiny of the Joint  Standing  Committee  on  Intelligence.  The
committee appreciates the co-operation and  commitment  of  these  services.
However, we are convinced that the former members of these  services  should
also be under restraint of trade  on  leaving  these  services,  as  in  the
civilian  structures.  They  should  also  develop  internal  mechanisms  to
resolve their disputes, particularly labour disputes.

We thank all our intelligence structures  for  ensuring  that  South  Africa
successfully  hosted  major  international  events.  This  has   contributed
towards improving the image of our country in the global village.  We  would
like to thank all our intelligence officers who,  through  their  dedication
and commitment, have ensured that our country is a  place  where  all  South
Africans are secure and where there is the prospect of  a  better  life  for
all being enjoyed.

I move that the report of the Joint Standing Committee on  Intelligence  for
2001 be adopted, with the amendment which includes the section  which  deals
with the SASS. [Applause.]

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Chairperson, we have a comprehensive report  of  the
Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence for the past year, setting out  our
activities  and  the  present  status   of   all   our   structures   within
Intelligence, Defence, the Police Service plus other related matters.

In my speech on Burundi some time ago, I advocated that South Africa  should
decide on its priorities and not get involved in sideshows, in  other  words
we need a national or, rather, a homeland security strategy. If we had  such
a strategy we would get more involved with problems  facing  us  inside  our
borders and immediately outside our borders, and  the  relevant  departments
would not be venturing into a vacuum and making assumptions  which  may  not
be true or valid.

Our Foreign Affairs, Defence, Intelligence, Finance  and  other  departments
cannot operate without knowing what our nation's priorities are. Within  the
parameters of this strategy our Ministry  of  Intelligence  can  effectively
plan and conduct operations. If not,  they  could  be  going  on  wild-goose
chases with no defined objectives.

We are on the threshold of a major war  in  the  Middle  East.  Fortunately,
South Africa was not directly involved in the last Gulf War and,  hopefully,
we will not be called upon to participate  actively  in  a  possible  future
war.

Last Friday the UN unanimously passed Resolution  1441  to  compel  Iraq  to
declare and get rid of all its weapons of  mass  destruction  and  to  allow
inspectors into the country. This resolution taken by the UN was a  historic
event. All 15 members of the Security Council voted in favour  of  it.  Even
Syria agreed to it, and so did Kofi Annan. Iraq  now  has  to  reply  within
seven days whether it accepts the resolution or  not,  and  by  the  end  of
another 23 days it has to declare all its weapons of mass destruction.

The visit of our Deputy Minister of  Foreign  Affairs  to  Iraq  poses  some
questions. If we had had nationals strategic priorities, maybe he would  not
have gone. We have been saying that his visit was  inopportune,  and  recent
events have proved it. I wonder what assurances he has given  Sadam  Hussein
on this issue. I can make a good deduction from the picture we  saw  in  the
press of him stepping on a Hussein pavement slogan which read ``George  Bush
is a criminal'' or words to that effect. [Interjections.] He was all  smiles
when the picture was taken. Which side must we be on then, that  of  Hussein
or the United Nations? His visit there  did  not  go  without  international
notice.

From our report one can see that all  the  necessary  substructures  are  in
place, and all that remains now is to produce and give outputs, and  for  us
as a committee to see that all are doing what they were intended to do,  and
that they do not spend their funds irresponsibly.

We  can  assure  the  House  that  we  are  well  aware  of  our   oversight
responsibilities and will act accordingly. My thanks  go  to  the  Minister,
the  chairman  of  the  committee  and  my  colleagues  on  the   committee.
[Applause.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: Chairperson, for various reasons, amongst others, the  very
thorough  and  involved  screening  processes  that  members  of  the  Joint
Standing Committee on Intelligence have to go through, and as  a  result  of
some misunderstandings thrown in for good measure, the IFP has not  had  any
representation on the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence  for  over  a
year until about a week ago.

Because of our unfortunate and enforced absence from the  committee,  it  is
unrealistic to expect us to make any real comments on the  report  that  has
been presented  to  Parliament  by  the  committee.  However,  after  having
studied the report from the disadvantaged position that  we  have  been  in,
there does not seem to be any  issues  contained  in  the  report  that  are
contradictory or problematic.

We also fully support the committee's request to all  stakeholders  involved
in the replacement process,  as  precribed  by  legislation,  to  have  this
process expedited. On the basis of the reasons given above, we take note  of
the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and will  support
its adoption.

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Chairperson, there are two areas of concern to the  New  NP
on the JSCI's oversight role. The one is the  co-ordinating  role  of  Nicoc
that causes concern and the  other  is  military  intelligence.  Both  these
services should improve  productivity  and  co-operation.  Discipline  is  a
continual problem in especially military intelligence.

It is also with regret that the report states  that  in  a  whole  year  the
Ministers of Defence and of Safety and Security  never  once  met  with  the
JSCI. We appreciate the fact that the Minister of Safety  and  Security  has
not been in office very long,  and  hope  this  situation  will  improve  in
future. An overall state of performance is very difficult for  the  JSCI  to
judge if these meetings do not take place regularly.

Een van die probleme wat die staande komitee  moet  hanteer,  is  die  groot
tekort aan finansiering  vir  die  komitee.  Daar  behoort  'n  formule  van
kriteria deur die Parlement  uitgewerk  te  word  oor  hoe  om  komitees  te
finansier.
Intelligensiedienste kan nie sonder ingeligte  oorsese  praktyke  die  beste
internasionale praktyk vir  Suid-Afrika  daarstel  nie.  Die  feit  dat  die
Staande Komitee op Intelligensie nie een keer hierdie afgelope boekjaar  met
ander lande kon gaan inligting  uitruil  en  van  ander  kon  leer  nie,  is
onaanvaarbaar. Die rede is suiwer 'n tekort aan geld, want daar was  heelwat
uitnodigings van ander lande.

Die staande komitee kan nie, soos ander staande komitees met borge  se  geld
of as gaste van ander lande se intelligensiedienste op studiebesoeke  oorsee
gaan nie, want uit die aard van ons werk laat dit die komitee oop  vir  baie
kritiek. Daarom is hierdie komitee, anders as ander komitees, geheel  en  al
van hul begroting van die Parlement afhanklik. Op die oomblik is dit  geheel
en al ontoereikend.

Die  Nuwe  NP  wil  die  verskeie  intelligensiedienste  gelukwens  met  die
afgelope jaar se groot suksesse. Ons dink hier veral aan die  groot  gebeure
soos die Wêreldberaad vir Volhoubare  Ontwikkeling;  die  stigting  van  die
Afrika-Unie; die sukses  sover  behaal  met  die  ultraregse  boeremag;  die
Kilroy-arrestasie namens Interpol en die FBI, ensovoorts.

Dit is die tipe suksesse wat Suid Afrika se statuur wêreldwyd  verhoog.  Die
Nuwe NP neem kennis van en steun die jaarverslag van die Staande Komitee  op
Intelligensie. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans of paragraphs follows.)

[One of the problems which the standing committee must handle  is  the  huge
shortage of funding for the committee.  A  formula  of  criteria  should  be
worked out by Paliament on how to finance committees.

Intelligence services cannot create  the  best  international  practice  for
South  Africa  without  informed  overseas  practices.  The  fact  that  the
Standing Committee on  Intelligence  could  not  exchange  information  with
other countries, nor learn from others even once during the  past  financial
year, is unacceptable. The reason is purely a  shortage  of  money,  because
there was a considerable number of invitations from other countries.

The standing committee cannot, like other standing committees, go abroad  on
study  tours  with  sponsors'  money,  or  as  guests  of  other  countries'
intelligence services, because as a result of the  nature  of  our  work  it
leaves the committee open to much criticism. That  is  why  this  committee,
unlike other committees,  is  completely  dependent  on  their  budget  from
Parliament. At the moment it is totally inadequate.

The New NP wants to congratulate the various intelligence  services  on  the
big successes of the past year. Here we think especially of the huge  events
like the World Summit on Substainable Development, the establishment of  the
African Union,  the  success  which  has  thus  far  been  gained  with  the
ultraright boeremag, the Kilroy arrest on behalf of Interpol  and  the  FBI,
etc.

These are the types of  successes  which  promote  South  African's  stature
worldwide. The New NP takes note of and supports the report of the  Standing
Committee on Intelligence. [Applause.]]

Mr S ABRAM:  Chairperson,  during  the  year  that  covers  this  particular
report, the current Deputy Minister of Home Affairs served  as  chairperson.
She succeeded in welding the committee into a  unit  which  focused  on  the
role and obligations that the statutes place on this  particular  committee.
We are now, of course, led by the current chairperson. I want  to  say  that
he is continuing the good work and examples that were set  by  the  previous
chairperson.

In a very short space of time - I have hardly started -  this  thing  starts
telling me I must shut up.

In the very short time that I have at my disposal, may I just appeal to  the
powers that be that the circumstances under which this particular  committee
operates, and the premises from which it operates are  extremely  inadequate
for an important committee like this one.

We are ill-resourced and ill-equipped. We do not have the modern  technology
and the modern equipment that are required at our offices.  The  environment
is not conducive to sustaining the work that we have to do, and  the  office
space is extremely inadequate. I believe it is overdue that we be  put  into
premises that will lend credence to the type of  important  work  that  this
committee has to do.

In conclusion, may I congratulate  all  the  agencies  of  the  intelligence
services on the wonderful  work  that  they  have  done  in  averting  major
disasters in our country. We are aware of the many  things  that  they  have
done. Regarding the disaster that overtook us two weeks ago, may we  express
the hope that the perpetrators will be tracked down and  that  the  citizens
will be proven wrong. I believe that they are being hidden away and  catered
for inside our country by some of their sympathisers, and I trust  that  our
intelligence forces will flush them out.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, the ACDP  supports  the
adoption of the annual report of the JSCI as tabled on 11 September 2002.

I believe that the JSCI should focus on the role of  Nicoc  in  the  future.
The JSCI needs to  give  closer  attention  to  the  activities  of  defence
intelligence, and crime intelligence, as borne out by  the  recent  bombings
in Soweto. The subsequent swift arrest bears out the importance of this.  We
have a democracy and therefore there is no need  to  take  up  arms  against
this Government. In this Parliament we fight with words and  ideas  and  not
with bullets.

We want to congratulate the relevant intelligence structures on  their  good
work that led to the swift arrest of those involved in the Soweto  bombings.
We pledge our support to these intelligence structures to bring to book  the
rest of the perpetrators. We agree that taxation of  foreign  allowances  of
members of the  foreign  services  should  be  discontinued  or  drastically
reduced.

In  conclusion,  I  wish  to  commend  and  congratulate  the  Minister   of
Intelligence and the chairperson of our committee  on  work  well  done  for
this year.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chair, the MF  salutes  the  Department  of  Intelligence's
dedication  to  protecting  the  South  African  citizenry,   our   national
interests and governments globally. The challenge of  this  task  is  known,
especially with security threats globally and the chill of the September  11
attacks that sent shivers down the spines of many  governments.  This  makes
one worry as to whether we are doing enough. Are we safe enough?  And  would
we be - could we be - ready for such, if any, attacks?

South Africa has good relations and works hard at these  relations,  earning
us a lot of  respect.  However,  we  do  often  find  ourselves  in  a  very
compromising  situation  that  could  be  quite  detrimental  to  the   good
relations that we have built up and maintained.

The MF is glad to note  the  section's  commitment  to  accountability  that
brings it into line  with  the  democratic  values  that  we  work  hard  to
inculcate in every sphere and sector. At the end  of  the  day  everyone  in
Government is here because of the people, and we remain responsible to  them
at all times.

Mr M I SCOTT:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  thank  you  very  much  for  the
opportunity to participate in  this  debate  on  the  report  of  the  Joint
Standing Committee on Intelligence.

We are  living  in  a  period  in  which  there  is  increased  pressure  on
intelligence communities worldwide. There is an  increase  in  international
terrorism,  in  international  right-wing   extremism   and   in   organised
transnational crime. This has led  to  quite  an  increase  in  spending  on
security organs. These conditions have changed  dramatically  the  strategic
direction the intelligence  structures  have  adopted  in  order  to  ensure
national security of their citizens and to contribute towards world peace.
It is important from the outset to commend  the  intelligence  agencies  for
the sterling  job  they  have  done  with  regard  to  the  quiet,  peaceful
international conferences that have been held  in  the  country.  We  should
also not forget the important role they are  playing  in  peace  efforts  in
Africa.

We  believe  that  we  should  encourage  our  communities  to   work   with
intelligence agencies to ensure that  we  all  contribute  towards  national
security. We should discourage those who do not value some of  our  national
institutions and who, at all times, try to demonise our security organs.  We
appeal to our people to protect and co-operate with our agencies.

We would like to reiterate that never again  shall  intelligence  structures
be abused, or abuse their power to undermine the  constitutional  rights  of
our citizens. It is for this reason that we have put in place  a  number  of
oversight structures. The Joint Standing Committee on  Intelligence  is  one
those intelligence oversight  mechanisms.  The  committee  takes  complaints
from members of the community. We have given such complaints  the  attention
they  deserve.  Some  have  also  come  from  members  of  the  intelligence
agencies.

It is important to note that international experience  has  proven  that  to
perform the oversight function of  intelligence  agencies  is  not  an  easy
task. It is quite  a  difficult  one.  It  is  for  that  reason  that  most
oversight structures in the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada, etc, have  quite
specialised, sizable and complementary staff. They  are  funded  differently
because of the nature of  their  work.  The  countries  that  have  such  an
oversight mechanism have been driven by the history  of  their  intelligence
structures.

In South Africa we believe that because of  our  history  it  is  imperative
that we have an oversight mechanism.  The  members  of  the  Joint  Standing
Committee on Intelligence should not be seen  or  perceived  as  spooks,  as
happens in the corridors of power here.

It is important to note that the committee has  been  encountering  problems
in order to function efficiently. We believe it is in the best interests  of
the nation and the institution to address such challenges. Let us  not  move
along a path that might wittingly or unwittingly cripple the committee.

On the issue of the budget, I think it is  important  that  we  be  able  to
develop a different formula for its funding. The committee  has,  at  times,
had to carry out investigations into the allegations it received, and  these
investigations have been carried out by MPs who have also had to  attend  to
their  overloaded  workload  at  Parliament  owing  to  their  small   staff
complement.

We  recommend  that  Parliament  consider  the  following:  one,  provide  a
properly secured place  around  Parliament;  two,  look  at  increasing  the
number of staff, in particular specialised staff; and, three, begin to  look
at new ways of funding in order for the committee to work properly.

We would like to appeal to everyone in this institution  to  work  with  the
JSCI in a way that assists it to fulfil its constitutional  and  legislative
obligations. We would  also  like  to  urge  the  intelligence  agencies  to
continue with ongoing training in order to further improve  the  quality  of
work of the intelligence agencies.

The co-ordination  of  intelligence  is  of  paramount  importance  for  the
agencies to succeed in the challenges facing our country. The route we  have
taken has proven to be the correct one as a country. We need to build on  it
in order to strengthen co-ordination. It has  delivered  some  fruits  on  a
number of projects.

The issue of a  threat  from  right-wing  extremists  needs  a  lot  of  co-
ordination. We would like  to  urge  the  heads  of  the  services  and  the
Ministers  to  ensure  that  we  eliminate  the   element   of   unnecessary
competition.

Finally, we urge all  our  citizens  to  co-operate  with  our  intelligence
agencies in dealing with the challenges facing our country. We  support  the
report. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON of COMMITTEES:  Order!  I  have  been  informed  that
there is an agreement that Orders of the Day Nos  4  and  5  will  be  taken
together. The Orders concern international agreements, reported  on  by  the
Portfolio Committee on Justice.

    CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS ON
                          MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE,
                             AND ON EXTRADITION
                 IN TERMS OF SECTION 231(2) OF CONSTITUTION

Mr G  SOLOMON:  Chair,  on  behalf  of  the  chairperson  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development, we  wish  to  make  the
following statement regarding agreements and  extradition  treaties  between
the Republic of South Africa and the governments of  the  Arab  Republic  of
Egypt, the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria, the Federal Republic  of
Nigeria, the French Republic and the People's Republic of China.

Extradition is the delivery of a criminal from one country to another  where
he or she is  accused  of  a  crime  or  has  been  convicted  of  a  crime.
International law does not recognise any general duty on the part of  states
to surrender criminals. In practice, therefore, the return of  criminals  is
secured by means of extradition agreements between states.

An extradition  agreement  determines  the  offences  in  respect  of  which
extradition is possible and the circumstances in which  extradition  can  be
refused. The procedures  to  be  followed  in  extradition  proceedings  are
determined by the Extradition Act.

Section  231(2)  of  the  Constitution,  furthermore,   provides   that   an
international agreement will only bind the Republic if it has been  approved
by resolution in both the National Assembly  and  the  National  Council  of
Provinces.

South Africa's political isolation during the apartheid era made  it  almost
impossible for it to  conclude  extradition  agreements.  Thankfully,  South
Africa has now returned  to  international  respectability  and  we  are  no
longer in isolation in respect of extradition.

Agreements  such  as  those  before  us  represent  an  important  means  of
extending our network of extradition agreements and  help  towards  fighting
crime in the international arena. Therefore,  we  request  the  approval  of
this House for the agreements and treaties entered into by the  Republic  of
South Africa and the countries mentioned. [Applause.]

There was no debate.

Agreement between the Government of the Republic of  South  Africa  and  the
Government of the Arab Republic of  Egypt  on  Mutual  Legal  Assistance  in
Criminal Matters approved.

Agreement between the Government of the Republic of  South  Africa  and  the
Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria  on  Mutual  Legal
Assistance in Criminal Matters approved.

Treaty between the Government of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa  and  the
Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Mutual Legal Assistance  in
Criminal Matters approved.

Agreement on  Mutual  Legal  Assistance  in  Criminal  Matters  between  the
Government of the Republic of South Africa and the Government of the  French
Republic approved.

Extradition Treaty between the Government of the Republic  of  South  Africa
and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt approved.

Agreement between the Government of the Republic of  South  Africa  and  the
Government of the Democratic People's Republic  of  Algeria  on  Extradition
approved.

Extradition Treaty between the Government of the Republic  of  South  Africa
and the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria approved.

Treaty between the Republic of South Africa and  the  People's  Republic  of
China on Extradition approved.

          CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE
     AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT - DELAY IN SUBMISSION OF TREATIES ON
                   EXTRADITION AND MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE

MR G SOLOMON: Chairperson, various reasons can be  mentioned  for  the  fact
that certain signed treaties were submitted to Parliament months after  they
were signed. Problems are  experienced  when  treaties  are  signed  by  the
Minister of Foreign Affairs in a foreign country or even in South Africa.
For some reason the Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  could  not  trace  the
treaties with Egypt, signed in Cairo on  22  October  2001.  The  department
only received the treaties on 23 May 2002. Although  the  Algerian  treaties
were signed by  Minister  Zuma  on  9  October  2001,  the  department  only
received the signed treaties on 29 May 2002.

With regard to the treaties with France, the protocol official mixed up  the
sequence of the agreements to be signed and the South African Minister  -  I
do not know which one it was - inadvertendly signed the French text  of  the
agreement. In other words, our Minister of  Foreign  Affairs  was  therefore
requested to  sign  the  French  text  months  after  the  original  signing
ceremony.

It must also be mentioned that when treaties with  different  countries  are
signed in a short space of time, they are kept until they  are  all  signed,
whereafter they are submitted in a batch  to  Parliament.  Therefore  it  is
hoped that the reasons given will be adequate for this House.

There was no debate.

The Deputy Chief Whip of the  Majority  Party  moved:  That  the  Report  be
adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

         CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW COMMITTEE

There was no debate.

The Deputy Chief Whip of the  Majority  Party  moved:  That  the  Report  be
noted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly noted.

                CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE
                  ON PRIVATE MEMBERS' LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS
                            AND SPECIAL PETITIONS
Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Chairperson, to  all  those  people  who  said  ``Hoor!
Hoor!'' I say thank you. The report is in two parts. The  first  part  deals
with a petition before the committee. The recommendation  of  the  committee
is that the petition of Mr O B van Schalkwyk not be granted.

The second part of the report is the annual  report  of  the  committee  for
last year. It sets out the number of public hearings and meetings that  were
held and the number of legislative proposals that were covered.  The  report
also states that three petitions were finalised and that two more are  being
dealt with.

Then, of course, with regard to administration,  the  committee  once  again
noted its concern with the problems of  photostat  facilities  available  to
the committee section and the problem with  the  high  staff  turnover,  and
recommends that committee chairs be consulted when their staff  are  changed
or appointed.

In conclusion, allow me to thank all the members of the  committee  for  the
manner in which they have always conducted themselves.

There was no debate.

The Deputy Chief Whip of the  Majority  Party  moved:  That  the  Report  be
noted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly noted.

             CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY PARLIAMENT
              OF INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS ON MONEY LAUNDERING,
        DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION IN TERMS OF SECTION 231(2)
                               OF CONSTITUTION

Ms B A HOGAN: Chairperson ... [Applause.] For  those  who  are  not  in  the
loop, this is just to keep  me  down  to  two  minutes!  There  is  no  such
agreement; we are here for one and a half hours  to  debate  this  document,
this document and this document. Let me get started! [Laughter.]

The two agreements here are very simple, that is the agreement  between  the
Republic of South Africa and the government of New Zealand  and,   likewise,
between South Africa and the government of the United Kingdom  and  Northern
Ireland. These are simply  double  taxation  agreements.  South  Africa,  as
members know, did not  have  many  double  taxation  agreements  during  the
apartheid era. Over the past couple of years we have had to ratify  a  large
number of double taxation agreements. These are another two sets  of  double
taxation agreements. They are very complex, but run to a standard form.

One of the issues which precipitated an exchange of notes was  how  we  deal
with secondary tax on companies, which is  a  uniquely  South  African  tax.
There is an agreement between these two countries as to how that  should  be
dealt with. I recommend to the House that these agreements be adopted.

The other agreement, which is a very important agreement,  is  around  anti-
money laundering. This agreement is a memorandum of understanding signed  by
our Minister of Finance in July  with  countries  in  Eastern  and  Southern
Africa to look at measures to counter money laundering.  At  the  launch  it
was agreed that a memorandum of understanding to establish  this  anti-money
laundering group, known as  the  Eastern  and  Southern  African  Anti-Money
Laundering Group, would be signed by the respective  countries.  Once  seven
countries have signed, the group exists.

I  am  happy  to  say  that  the  republics  of  Kenya,  Malawi,  Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, Uganda and the United Republic of  Tanzania
have all signed the memoranda of understanding, followed  more  recently  by
the Kingdom of Swaziland. As I said, our Minister signed in July  2002,  and
so the ESAAMLG council has been formed. The  objectives  of  ESAAMLG  is  to
make a political commitment to implementing the Finance  Action  Task  Force
standards in respect of money laundering.

ESAAMLG will also adopt and implement the 40 recommendations  of  that  task
force by creating enabling  legislation  and  the  deployment  of  capacity,
applying  anti-money  laundering  measures  to  all   serious   crimes   and
implementing any other measures contained in multilateral agreements.

The memorandum of understanding also specifies  that  all  member  countries
should establish financial intelligence units and  agree  to  undergo  self-
assessments and mutual evaluations of the  extent  of  their  compliance  to
these standards. This applies to their legislative,  financial  intelligence
and law-enforcement capacities.

ESAAMLG has initiated a process to start evaluations of member countries  to
be conducted by their peers. South Africa has volunteered to undergo such  a
mutual evaluation process. Training to equip evaluators will be provided  by
a combined FATF and ESAAMLG team in late  January.  South  Africa  has  been
approached to host this training programme. It is expected that this  mutual
evaluation will be conducted in March 2003.
This evaluation process is different from FATF-style assessments,  which  in
future will be conducted according to the new assessment  methodology  which
was adopted by FATF at its recent plenary meeting in Paris in October.  This
methodology will include an assessment of measures to combat  the  financing
of terrorism.

In addition,  the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank  have  now  been  accepted  as
institutions  which  may  undertake  such  assessments,  although  the  law-
enforcement component remains solely within the ambit of FATF. South  Africa
will undergo such an assessment in late February or early March 2003.

The final  implication  for  South  Africa  is  the  payment  of  an  annual
membership fee of US$20 000. [Applause.]

Memorandum of Understanding among Member  Governments  of  the  Eastern  and
Southern African Anti-Money Laundering  Group  and  the  Republic  of  South
Africa approved.

Convention between the Government of the Republic of South  Africa  and  the
Government of the United Kingdom of Britain and  Northern  Ireland  for  the
Avoidance of Double Taxation and  the  Prevention  of  Fiscal  Evasion  with
respect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains approved.

Agreement between the Government of the Republic of  South  Africa  and  the
Government of New Zealand for the  Avoidance  of  Double  Taxation  and  the
Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income approved.

The House adjourned at 15:52.

2.    Report of the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Finance  on  the  Medium-Term
     Budget Policy Statement, dated 11 November 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on Finance reports as follows:


     1.  Terms of Reference and hearings


         The Minister of Finance tabled the 2002 Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
         Statement (MTBPS) before Parliament on  Tuesday  29  October  2002.
         The 2002 MTBPS  sets  out  the  macroeconomic  context  and  fiscal
         policy  considerations  against  which  the  2003  Budget  will  be
         framed. It  outlines  developments  in  tax  policy  and  the  main
         spending priorities for the  next  three-year  (2003/4  to  2005/6)
         Medium-Term  Expenditure   Framework   (MTEF)   period,   including
         allocations to provincial and local government levels.


         The terms of reference of the Finance Committee were:


         * To hear from the Minister of Finance and the Director-General  of
           National Treasury on the MTBPS and to report on these hearings.
         * To analyse and debate Chapters 2, 3  and  4  of  the  Medium-Term
           Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS). These are the chapters covering
           macroeconomic challenges  and  adjustments,  fiscal  policy  and
           budget framework and taxation.
         * To hold hearings on the issues dealt with in chapters  2,  3  and
           4. Chapters 5 and 6, dealing with the MTEF  and  provincial  and
           local government finances, were referred  to  the  Joint  Budget
           Committee which will report separately.


         In  a  joint  sitting  with  the  Budget  Committee,  the   Finance
         Committee heard evidence from and questioned  the  Director-General
         of National Treasury.


         Then, in order to thoroughly analyse and debate  the  issues  dealt
         with in chapters 2, 3  and  4,  the  Committee  invited  economists
         representing  the  following  institutions  to  give  evidence:  JP
         Morgan, Mazwai Securities and Sanlam.


         The content of the MTBPS is briefly summarised below,  as  are  the
         individual presentations thereafter.


     2.  THE MTBPS IN SUMMARY


     2.1 Introduction and overview


         The Minister drew  particular  attention  to  our  strong  economic
         recovery over the past year, which requires upward revision of  GDP
         growth projections, to 2,6 per cent for 2002 and 3,5 per  cent  for
         2003.


         Important signs of investment in the  productive  capacity  of  the
         economy are  starting  to  show.  Private  consumption  is  growing
         steadily at some 3 per cent annually,  supported  in  part  by  tax
         reductions, and  real  spending  on  government  services  is  also
         increasing.


         The rise in inflation this year was a  setback  for  the  inflation
         reduction objectives, which are now being  revised  to  remain  3-6
         per cent for  2004.  The  Minister  expects  inflation  to  decline
         during 2003, and to fall to under 6 per cent of  the  CPIX  average
         in the last quarter.


         The Commission of Inquiry into the rapid depreciation of  the  Rand
         has  endorsed  government's  policy  of  gradual  exchange  control
         liberalisation, which  policy  will  continue.  In  the  spirit  of
         Nepad,  the  allowance  for  investment  into  Africa  is   sharply
         increased in the MTBPS.


     2.2 Macroeconomic challenges and adjustments


         The MTBPS is formulated against  the  background  of  macroeconomic
         projections,  whose  conditions  determine  its  revenue  envelope.
         Despite  an  unpredictable  global  economy  with  shifts  in   key
         commodity  prices,  the  investment  climate  and  subdued   global
         growth, the Treasury feels cautious optimism.
         The domestic economy has shown  robust  and  broad-based  strength,
         despite the declining international trend.  South  African  exports
         and tourism grew strongly - an unexpected benefit of  the  fall  of
         the rand - and firm  commodity  prices  (especially  for  gold  and
         platinum) led to a trade account surplus of 5 per cent of GDP.  The
         exchange  rate  is  now  stabilising  at  a  level  which   appears
         beneficial to sustained growth.


         The rate of job losses has declined to the point of  stabilisation,
         and net job creation is expected  soon.  The  balance  of  payments
         shows an R27  billion  surplus,  with  small  current  account  and
         financial account surpluses. Domestic  investment  and  consumption
         have also stayed positive so far. The latter may reflect  tax  cuts
         to low-income earners in the next budget.


         Net foreign direct investment levels of R8,3 billion in  the  first
         half  of  2002  were  positive,  with  real  gross  fixed   capital
         formation growing to 6 per cent in the first quarter of this  year,
         and 7 per cent in the second,  indicating  healthy  levels  of  net
         foreign investment. The exchange rate is stabilising.


         Inflation is the major challenge, impacting  disproportionately  on
         poor households. The depreciation of the  Rand  during  the  fourth
         quarter of 2001 was followed by high oil  prices,  production  cost
         pressures and a 20,2 per cent rise in food prices in  the  year  to
         September  2002.  It  is  therefore  expected  that  the  projected
         inflation target for 2002-03 will be missed.


         The Treasury expects CPIX to peak towards the end of  2002  at  9,6
         per cent. Accordingly, the Minister  of  Finance  and  the  Reserve
         Bank agreed to adjust the  inflation  reduction  objectives  agreed
         between them to a band of 3-6 per cent, with the 2005  target  left
         open. The CPIX average is unlikely to fall within the target  range
         again until the last quarter of next year.


         Despite this, overall government debt is down, and  debt  servicing
         levels are healthy.


     2.3 Fiscal policy and budget framework


         Expansionary  fiscal  measures  will  continue,  made  possible  by
         declining  debt  service  costs  which  enable  higher  levels   of
         spending. Debt service costs continue to decline  steadily  to  3,9
         per cent of GDP by 2005-06, with the stock of  national  debt  down
         to a healthy 37,7 per cent of GDP by 2005-06.


         Accordingly, the 2002  MTBPS  states  that  the  stabilisation  and
         structural  changes  initiated  from  1996,  enabled   the   growth
         oriented  fiscal  stance  set  out  in  the  past  two  budgets  to
         continue. Increased poverty reduction in tandem  with  measures  to
         stimulate growth  have  become  possible.  Thus  strong  real  non-
         interest expenditure growth  averaging  4,7  per  cent  a  year  is
         provided for, while moderate tax relief will continue in  the  face
         of adverse global conditions.


         An additional amount of R84,9 billion has been allocated  over  the
         2003 MTEF period to address social  and  economic  needs  over  and
         above the 2002 MTEF allocations.  R57,1  billion  is  allocated  to
         infrastructure development, land  restitution,  health,  education,
         higher education restructuring and improved courts  administration.
         A further R27,8 billion is set  aside  to  offset  the  effects  of
         inflation, primarily for social grants and increases  in  personnel
         spending.


         Revenue forecasts indicate an R8,1 billion revenue  overrun,  which
         reflects the  impact  of  inflation  and  efficiencies  in  revenue
         collection. However,  as  a  percentage  of  GDP,  tax  revenue  is
         marginally below the levels forecast.


         The net open forward position  (NOFP)  has  been  brought  down  to
         US$1,7 billion, from US$4,8 billion at the end of 2001. Of  concern
         are the losses sustained on forward  contracts  over  the  previous
         four years, which have been accumulating in the  Gold  and  Foreign
         Exchange Contingency Reserve (GFECR), and  have  now  been  brought
         into the  budget.  The  Auditor-General  will  verify  the  amount,
         projected at R27 billion on 31 March 2002. Government plans to  pay
         this over the  four-year  MTBP  period  through  the  issue  of  R7
         billion of zero  coupon  bonds  a  year.  This  situation  must  be
         monitored carefully as projected losses may increase  further.  Due
         to the depreciation of the Rand,  the  Reserve  Bank  has  incurred
         significant losses in  settling  its  obligations  on  the  forward
         book. A consolation is that the amount owed is in Rands.
         Although these payments  raise  future  interest  costs  above  the
         figures projected in the 2002 budget, debt service costs are  still
         projected to decline to 4 per  cent  of  GDP  by  2005/6.  National
         government debt declines to 37,7 per cent of  GDP  by  2005-06  and
         foreign debt declines to 7,1 per cent of GDP by 2005-06.


     2.4 Taxation


         Tax revenue is projected to remain at about 24,5 per  cent  of  GDP
         (excluding UIF and social  security  funds).  The  2002-03  revenue
         estimate was increased by  R8,1  billion,  reflecting  conservative
         estimates, as well as strong  company  tax  performances  and  SARS
         efficiencies.


         National budget revenue collection this year is  running  ahead  of
         target, which should allow for a further  moderate  real  reduction
         in the personal income  tax  burden  on  lower-  and  middle-income
         earners again during the 2003-04 fiscal year.


         A thorough review of the taxation of  retirement  savings  is  also
         under way, with wide consultations and enactment into law by  2004.
         The Mineral  Royalty  Bill  containing  a  proposed  structure  and
         design of a mineral and  petroleum  royalty  system  in  line  with
         international best practices will be introduced in 2003.


         In  addition  to   the   accelerated   depreciation   allowed   for
         manufacturing assets in terms of the  2002  budget,  government  is
         considering further measures aimed at expanding  capital  formation
         and  technology  research  and  development.  Measures  to  support
         savings by lower income groups are also being considered.


         A budget deficit of 2,2 per cent of GDP is projected for the  2003-
         04 financial year, projected to fall to 2 per cent in 2005-06.
     2.5 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework


         The 2003 MTEF has the following priorities:


         * Extending social assistance, health and education
         * Investing in municipal infrastructure and basic services
         * Expanding capacity  in  the  safety  and  security  sector,  with
           particular focus on court administration
         * Higher education restructuring
         * Accelerating land reform and restitution
         * Better services to citizens provided by Home Affairs
         * South Africa's growing international role, notably in  Nepad  and
           the AU


         The  preliminary  budget  framework  proposes  R84,9   billion   in
         additional allocations over the 2002 MTEF baseline amounts.  Social
         and  basic  service  delivery  is   prioritised,   with   provinces
         receiving the largest adjustments -  a  further  R12,3  billion  in
         2003-04, rising to R20,8 billion in  2005-06.  In  relative  terms,
         local government receives the largest increase, at 18,4  per  cent,
         compared with 9 per  cent  for  provinces  and  7,3  per  cent  for
         national departments.


         The 2003 budget will consolidate  and  deepen  the  attainments  of
         expenditure priorities  in  earlier  budgets.  Key  priorities  are
         continued investment in infrastructure,  and  extending  basic  and
         social service  provision  to  reduce  poverty  and  vulnerability.
         Government  aims  to  strengthen  service  delivery  to  the  poor,
         through  higher  rates  of  economic  growth  and  development  and
         through  strengthening   sustainable   interventions   to   achieve
         increased equity and redistribution. The 2003 MTEF  will  therefore
         continue to emphasise spending on infrastructure and improving  the
         quality of social service delivery.


         Stable revenue performance and fiscal prudence  which  has  led  to
         declining debt  service  costs,  has  enabled  Government  to  make
         possible higher levels of non-interest spending  growth,  averaging
         4,7 per cent in real terms over the 2003 MTEF.


     2.6 Provincial and local government finances


         The  supplementary  allocations  to  provinces  will  support   the
         broadening and deepening of social  services.  Increased  financial
         support to provinces will focus on the following programmes:


         * Social grants will continue to  be  adjusted  to  compensate  for
           inflation;
         * A progressive  roll-out  of  HIV/Aids  prevention  and  treatment
           programmes,  together  with  a   renewed   focus   on   sexually
           transmitted infections, TB and malaria treatments;
         * Investment in hospital  buildings  and  facilities,  schools  and
           clinics will continue to be enhanced;
         * Spending on learning support materials  in  schools  and  medical
           supplies in health facilities will be stepped up; and
         * Steady increases in investment in  the  provincial  road  network
           will be supported.


         Capacity  development  which  enables  institutions   to   disburse
         allocations  with  increased  effectiveness  is   an   element   of
         infrastructure building. Allocation to local  government  continues
         the  emphasis  on  municipal  infrastructure  investment  and   the
         broadening  of  access  to  free  basic  water   and   electricity.
         Government rural development and urban renewal  strategies  provide
         a  co-ordinating  framework  for  creating   jobs   and   extending
         development of communities.


         The real growth in government spending on services is  expected  to
         contribute to moderate growth in employment in the years ahead.  An
         amount of R400 million a year has  been  set  aside  for  emergency
         relief for those facing desperate  circumstances  as  a  result  of
         food shortages and food price increases.


     3.  TREASURY DIRECTOR-GENERAL'S PRESENTATION TO JOINT COMMITTEE


         The Director-General of the National Treasury,  Maria  Ramos,  gave
         evidence before the  Joint  Budget  Committee  on  30  October.  In
         overview, the MTBPS was formulated against  the  background  of  an
         unpredictable global economy.  However,  against  this  trend,  the
         South African  economy  has  seen  steady  real  economic  activity
         improvement, despite a marked increase in the inflation rate.


     3.1 Highlights
         The  Director-General  drew  attention  to  the   following   MTBPS
         highlights:


         * The Treasury has revised (GDP) growth forecasts  upwards  to  2,6
           per cent this year, from  the  2,3  per  cent  forecast  in  the
           budget. GDP growth is projected to rise further to 3,5 per  cent
           in 2003-04.
         * The inflation target  for  2002  and  2003  is  projected  to  be
           missed, primarily because of direct and second-stage effects  of
           currency depreciation and oil and food price increases. However,
           the Treasury expects inflation  to  drop  to  within  the  newly
           expanded 3-6 per cent band in the last quarter of 2003.
         * Exchange  control  limits  on  investment  into  Africa  will  be
           increased from R750 million to R2  billion,  in  the  spirit  of
           support  for  Nepad.  Though  further  relaxation  of   exchange
           controls may be possible in the budget, the  government  remains
           committed to a strategy of gradual relaxation.
         * Expenditure will show strong real growth, averaging 4,7 per  cent
           a year over the 2003 MTEF period. Increased spending  on  social
           priorities  is  balanced  with  measures  to  increase  economic
           growth, notably  development  of  infrastructure  and  tax  cuts
           targeted  to  low-  and  middle-income   groups   which   enable
           stimulatory increases in consumption, as well as investment  and
           technology friendly measures.
         * Revenue is again in excess of estimates, with  an  additional  R8
           billion reflecting both South  African  Revenue  Service  (SARS)
           efficiencies and robust company tax performances. In each of the
           coming three years, revenue is projected at just  under  24  per
           cent of GDP.
         *  Revenue  allocation  between  national,  provincial  and   local
           government shows a shift towards the latter  two.  An  important
           element  of  this  involves  developing  local  and   provincial
           capacity to disburse allocated funds.
         *  Budget  priorities  build  on  gains  arising  out  of  previous
           budgets: Social services - health,  education,  plus  water  and
           electricity for  households  -  receive  the  largest  increase,
           followed by crime fighting and  justice,  land  restitution  and
           mainly African international commitments.


     4.  ECONOMISTS' RESPONSES TO CHAPTERS 2, 3 AND 4 OF MTBPS


         Economists from three institutions - JP Morgan,  Mazwai  Securities
         and Sanlam - presented responses to the MTBPS.


         It is important to note that their responses shared several  common
         themes:


         * Each endorsed the trends of  the  medium-term  budget  policy  as
           positive, while submitting input and suggestions  on  particular
           issues.
         * All saw, and endorsed, a shift in policy emphasis whereby  fiscal
           mechanisms play  an  increasing  role  in  combating  inflation,
           rather than using monetary policy alone to lower inflation.
         * All felt that the  deficit  can  be  allowed  to  grow  from  its
           present  low  level,  given  the  principles   which   structure
           expenditure at present.


     4.1. SUBMISSION BY JP MORGAN (JPM)


     4.1.1 MTBPS growth prediction over-optimistic


         JPM  expects  weaker  growth  in  2003  than  the  official  budget
         forecasts. They predict growth at around 2,5 per  cent,  while  the
         MTBPS predicts growth of 3,5 per cent. They believe that the  MTBPS
         growth forecast is optimistic for a number of reasons:


         * Recent monetary tightening is likely to lead  to  a  slowdown  in
           household consumption over the next  12  to  18  months.  Demand
           indicators are already showing signs of a slowdown  (retail  and
           auto sales).
         *  Lower  investment:  both  bond  and  equity   portfolio   flows,
           notoriously volatile, turned negative  in  the  second  half  of
           2002. Outflows have picked up as expected, now that the  Myburgh
           Commission investigation and report are complete.
         * Higher inflation: JPM predicts a further interest  rate  hike  in
           November.
         * The official forecast of 6,4  per  cent  export  growth  in  2003
           looks  difficult  to  achieve  during  subdued   global   growth
           recovery. There has been a strong trade performance in the  past
           10 months thanks to a weak currency, but export  performance  is
           starting to drop off due to an uncertain global outlook.


     4.1.2 Fiscal conservatism


         JPM are disappointed that government has not taken the  opportunity
         to  reduce  the  tax  burden  further,  believing   that   emerging
         economies have a window of opportunity to  do  this  with  positive
         effect at a particular stage of their restructuring.  They  believe
         that government now has plenty of scope to increase expenditure  to
         advance tax reform  and  to  spend  on  infrastructure,  given  the
         capacity  to  absorb  this.  JPM  believes  that  a  larger  fiscal
         stimulus  could  have  been  made  in  the  budget  statement,  but
         government expenditure control remains unnecessarily tight.


         They were generally very positive about government's initiative  to
         move away from regulating inflation  purely  with  monetary  policy
         and to use fiscal mechanisms such  as  reducing  taxes  to  achieve
         their goal of keeping inflation low; however, they felt  that  much
         more was needed.


     4.1.3 Budget deficit is unnecessarily low


         JPM believes that our budget deficit for  2002-03  and  2003-04  is
         unnecessarily tight at 1,6 per cent and 2,2 per cent of GDP,  given
         infrastructure spending and tax reform needs.  High  infrastructure
         spending in the health and education sectors is needed in  emerging
         markets, and ours is very low relative to other  European  emerging
         markets (Czechoslovakia 6,4; Poland 4,4; Hungary  5,3).  We  should
         be spending more. We may  be  missing  our  window  of  opportunity
         because  all  of  our  indicators  are  ripe  now   for   increased
         expenditure.


         It was, however, highlighted  that  although  a  more  expansionary
         fiscal policy was desirable,  this  increased  government  spending
         should  be   carefully   balanced   between   tax   reduction   and
         infrastructure spending because we still need to work on  improving
         institutional capacity to absorb expenditure increases.


     4.1.4 Further inflation overshooting of official forecasts is likely


         JPM believes that inflation will  continue  to  overshoot  official
         targets,  and  therefore  inflation  forecasts  for  2002-03   look
         optimistic,  given  evidence  of  second-round  effects   of   wage
         settlements and broad-based increases in inflation  in  2002.  They
         believe that, given the scale of inflation overshoot in  2002,  and
         to prevent deterioration in inflation  expectations,  the  SARB  is
         likely to increase interest rates by a further percentage point  in
         November. They expect  inflation  to  peak  at  12,2  per  cent  in
         November. Their reasons are as follows:


         * Food price inflation remains a major cause for concern,  and  has
           been increasing steadily at both the producer and consumer level
           in the past year. JPM expects further increases.
         *  Current  inflation  is  broad-based:  although   inflation   was
           initially  driven  by  exogenous  shocks,  it  has  become  very
           widespread.
         * Petrol price increases remain a major risk.
         * More pass-through from the Rand  depreciation  is  a  risk,  both
           directly (although the behaviour of corporate margins makes  the
           extent difficult to predict) and  through  second-round  effects
           via   deterioration   in   inflation   expectations   and   wage
           settlements.


     4.1.5 Revenue collection


         JPM believes that government has been very  cautious  with  revenue
         projections for 2002-03. Growth in government revenue  is  forecast
         to be 10,1 per cent for the year, while JPM expects revenue  growth
         close to 13 per cent due to very strong  growth  in  corporate  tax
         revenue (especially mining) and  strong  retail  sales  which  have
         helped VAT collection and continued improvement in  the  efficiency
         of tax collection.


     4.1.6 Inflation targeting suggestions


         Much of the South African policy regime conforms  to  international
         best practice, but the 2002 experience suggests:


         * More frequent meetings  of  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee  are
           desirable to enable a  rapid  reaction  to  inflation-generating
           shocks. There is uncertainty over inflation forecasting  due  to
           structural change in the economy.
         * More  information  is  required  on  transmission  mechanism  and
           inflation  pass-through  from  Rand  fluctuations   to   improve
           accuracy of predictions.
         * The  SARB  should  have  a  secondary  objective  of  stabilising
           employment; its current escape clauses deal only with shocks.
         * The SARB is correct to have an inflation target of  just  one  to
           two years, and not to forecast too far in  advance,  until  they
           know what is stable.


     4.2 SUBMISSION BY MAZWAI SECURITIES (MS)


         Overall,  MS  sees  the  MTBP  as  positive  for  economic  growth,
         together  with  poverty  relief.   It   believes   a   still   more
         expansionary stance could have been  adopted  without  compromising
         fiscal discipline. MS perceives a seemingly conflicting  stance  in
         relation to inflation targeting, and is concerned that some  issues
         on which the market wanted more information were not addressed.


     4 2.1 Positive overview


         MS welcomed the budget as both providing  for  poverty  relief  and
         pro-growth. The revenue  overrun,  the  low  1,6  per  cent  budget
         deficit and the estimated 41,4 per cent debt to GDP ratio  are  all
         signs of fiscal health. The practical efforts to  meet  expenditure
         objectives are also positive, notably:


         *  Increased  infrastructure  spending  on   public   services   at
           national, local and provincial levels
         * The rise in the ratio of capital to current expenditure
         * Enhancing service delivery by grants for  capacity  building  and
           restructuring


         This budget provides for  increased  expenditure  over  the  medium
         term, with expenditure expected to grow by 4,7 per cent  per  annum
         in real terms over the period. The emphasis on poverty  relief  and
         social security spending is especially welcome as a  step  that  is
         sorely needed  in  poverty  stricken  areas  of  the  country.  The
         emphasis on education, health and improved infrastructure  is  also
         positive. Increased spending should also drive economic growth  and
         social advancement.


         Macroeconomic factors of note:


         * MS is bearish about international equity recovery,  expecting  it
           to stay where it is for the next 12-24 months.
         * On the prospects for the Rand, MS  is  positive,  believing  that
           export-based currencies should outperform others.
         * The issue of long-term capital  investment  prospects  for  South
           Africa is hard to calculate. MS hopes it is seeing the beginning
           of a shift in international investor modalities from  investment
           based on the growth  rate,  to  investment  based  on  the  real
           interest rate, as theory would recommend.


     4.2.2 Budget deficit may be unnecessarily low


         Though  expenditure  is  increasing  and  is  being   directed   to
         government's priority areas, nominal expenditure  growth  decreases
         over the period from 16 per cent between fiscal  years  2001-02  to
         8,5 per cent between 2003-04 and 2004-05. Non-interest  expenditure
         growth also falls from 6,7 per cent to 4,7 per cent in the period.


         MS questions whether a deficit at 1,6 per cent of GDP  is  not  too
         low, given  the  extent  of  socioeconomic  challenges  that  South
         Africa faces. They believe that the country could afford to  borrow
         more, especially in the local  bond  market  which  is  subject  to
         supply pressures,  and  direct  additional  resources  towards  the
         economic upliftment of the people and job creation.


         In such a situation, the deficit should be assessed in relation  to
         real growth, with the deficit  rate  always  kept  below  the  real
         growth rate.


     4.2.3 Concern: fiscal versus monetary policy framework


         Though monetary policy is the  sphere  of  the  Reserve  Bank,  the
         government sets the inflation targets. The increase  in  government
         personnel spending this year was largely due to a 9 per  cent  wage
         hike and the expansionary  stance  taken  by  fiscal  policy.  This
         raises the question of how effectively fiscal policy  supports  the
         desired lower inflation outcome.


         The CPIX inflation forecast in the  MTBP  statement  has  increased
         from 6,7 to 10 per cent this fiscal year,  but  falls  to  4,8  per
         cent in the outer year of the 2003 MTEF period.  MS  believes  that
         this indicates that government is  gearing  itself  up  for  higher
         inflation  than  targeted  in  the  medium  term,  and  will  spend
         likewise. MS fears that there  is  a  danger  that  this  inflation
         scenario could become self-fulfilling  because  spending  has  been
         adjusted  upwards.  MS  therefore   believes   that   this   budget
         adjustment indicates a marginal shift in government policy  towards
         growth and away from low inflation.


     4.2.4 Issues omitted in MTBPS


         There are a number of issues that the market wants  clarity  about,
         which were not addressed in the MTBPS:


         * Privatisation and Telkom: Market consensus  is  that  the  Telkom
           listing at the tabling of the 2002 budget in February is  likely
           to realise less than half of the R12 billion proceeds originally
           expected. The market expected clarity as to  what  the  expected
           proceeds from the IPO would be and  how  National  Treasury  was
           going to make up for the shortfall in funding. This  information
           was not forthcoming.
         * The Arms Procurement deal. The market anticipated  an  update  on
           costs of the arms procurement  deal  and  expectations  thereof.
           This information was also not forthcoming in the statement.
         *  Inflation  Targeting.  Market  participants  were  looking   for
           clarity and predictability on how inflation targets are set, and
           for predictable procedures for  rapid  policy  response  to  any
           shocks in future.  The  market  is  therefore  still  left  with
           uncertainty on how the Reserve Bank will respond  in  future  to
           inflationary crises, and what procedures will be  in  place  for
           this.


     4.3  SUBMISSION BY SANLAM


     4.3.1 Macroeconomic consolidation and growth forecasts


         Sanlam's chief economist commended  the  government's  contribution
         and  commitment  to  growth   in   recent   years,   and   welcomed
         government's  increasingly  expansionary   fiscal   policy.   South
         Africa's fiscal consolidation after the 1998 Asian crisis has  been
         paying off increasingly strongly after 2001.


         Growth rate: Sanlam forecasts 2,7 per cent economic growth  in  the
         2002-03  financial  year,  and  is  cautious  about   the   2003-04
         financial year to be 2,9 per cent, in contrast  to  the  Treasury's
         forecast of 3,5 per cent for next year.   Overall,  Sanlam  expects
         steady growth to continue.


         The private capital spending trend is encouraging,  but  Treasury's
         projected increase in consumption expenditure is  unlikely  in  the
         near future, as the impact of 400 base point  interest  rate  hikes
         experienced this  year  will  be  felt  increasingly  in  the  near
         future. An increase in consumption expenditure is only possible  in
         the third quarter of the 2003-04 financial year.


         Export growth in particular has enabled South Africa  to  buck  the
         world recessionary trend so far. Job losses  have  slowed,  despite
         external shocks  which  have  set  off  a  number  of  second-stage
         inflationary  trends  which  will  result  in  slower  growth  than
         projected by the MTBPS.


     4.3.2 Inflation and exchange rate


         Sanlam believes that current inflation  rates  are  at  their  peak
         with CPIX around 9 per cent. They expect  CPIX  to  decline  to  an
         average of 6 per cent in 2003, falling further to 5,4 per  cent  in
         2004.


         South  Africa's  inflation  targeting  regime  is  set  to   become
         increasingly effective, especially now the band has been  broadened
         to 3-6 per cent, which is realistically attainable. It is  also  an
         appropriate level for an emerging economy which  needs  to  develop
         infrastructure  and  stimulate  poorer   households'   consumption.
         Therefore,  increasing  use  of  fiscal  mechanisms   rather   than
         interest rates to contain inflation, is appropriate.


         Interest rates now are also at a peak, but cannot  be  expected  to
         fall back to pre-shock levels, due to emerging economy dynamics.
         Exchange rate:  The  volatility,  and  hence  unpredictability,  of
         South Africa's exchange  rate  is  a  major  problem.  The  current
         balance between currencies seems in South Africa's  best  interest,
         and the Rand outlook is steady, although in world terms the  Dollar
         is 20% overvalued in the view of a number of economists.


     4.3.3 SA trends compared to other economies


         Sanlam compared South Africa's GDP  growth  and  that  of  the  USA
         after 1994. South Africa's growth, though volatile  in  comparison,
         stands up well, with only five quarters  of  negative  growth  over
         the period.
         It then  compared  South  Africa's  growth  experience  with  other
         emerging economies in  Asia,  South  America  and  Eastern  Europe,
         based on the IMF World Economic Outlook, May 2002.  On  average  it
         found South Africa's economic growth to have been the least  rapid,
         but it was also the least volatile - the most steady of the  eleven
         compared.


         Recent fall-offs in equity investment in  South  Africa  of  course
         reflects the bursting of  the  technology  bubble,  a  slowdown  in
         world growth  and  concern  with  corporate  accountability  making
         investors increasingly  bearish.  South  Africa's  Mining  Charter,
         Financial  Charter  and  Community  Re-investment  Bill  have  also
         caused foreign equity investors to "vote with their feet".


     4.3.4 Key macroeconomic policy shifts


         * The shift in priorities from inflation containment  via  interest
           rates to growth is positive.
         * The inflation target is now realistic, and the secular  inflation
           decline trend is intact.
         *  However,  further  structural  decline  in  inflation  will   be
           difficult to achieve in this context.


     4.3.5 Productivity and savings structurally important


         Sanlam noted that productivity increases to date had  come  at  the
         expense of job losses. They  are,  however,  positive  that  steady
         economic growth will in future create  more  jobs,  although  these
         are likely to be in the skilled sectors.


         Their other concern  is  the  lack  of  skilled  labour,  and  they
         accordingly endorse government's  strategic  investment  programmes
         and the introduction of learnership allowances.


     4.3.6 Supporting savings/investment


         The MTBPS intention to promote both a culture of  saving,  and  its
         present work on a support strategy for increased access to  deposit
         facilities by the poor is important, since tax relief alone  cannot
         encourage savings by poor and remote households.  Further  measures
         are required.


         However,  tax  policy  on  the  retirement  industry  is  seen   as
         regressive by Sanlam. Although its introduction has been  postponed
         till next year, Sanlam's view is  that  the  proposed  regime  will
         also discourage people from savings.


         Further relaxation of exchange controls is also important for  this
         purpose.

4.     Report  on  Activities  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Trade  and
     Industry, November 2001 - October 2002, dated 30 October 2002:


         The rules of Parliament provide  for  Portfolio  Committees,  inter
         alia, (1) to deal with legislation referred to them by  the  House,
         including   hearing   from   interested   parties   and   proposing
         amendments; (2) to oversee the work of the  corresponding  Ministry
         and government department; and (3) to make  policy  proposals.  The
         Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry has been  active  at  all
         of these levels. It  has  been  responsible  for  processing  bills
         introduced by  the  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry,  which  has
         frequently  involved  holding   public   hearings   and   proposing
         amendments. Together with the  Select  Committee  on  Economic  and
         Foreign Affairs in the National Council of  Provinces,  with  which
         the Committee  has  worked  closely,  a  number  of  oversight  and
         monitoring activities were  initiated.  Regular  briefings  on  the
         work of the various  divisions  of  the  Department  of  Trade  and
         Industry and associated structures have also been organised.


         Representatives of the eight parties represented  in  the  National
         Assembly have been deployed to the Committee.  The  Chairperson  is
         Dr Rob Davies of  the  ANC.  Mr  Edgar  de  Koker  is  the  Control
         Committee Secretary, Ms Lungi Matshikiza  the  Committee  Secretary
         and  Mr  Martiens  Erasmus  the  Committee  Assistant.  Mr  Ekhsaan
         Jawoodien of the Parliamentary Research Unit has provided  research
         assistance.


         1.  Statistics


              The Portfolio Committee  met  46  times  during  Parliamentary
              sessions held between  November  2001  and  October  2002,  in
              addition to meetings held during two oversight visits  to  the
              Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in Tshwane. Seven Bills
              were presented to the Committee. In addition to formal reports
              in connection with bills, the Committee tabled  three  reports
              that  were  published  in  the  Announcements,   Tabling   and
              Committee Reports (ATC) bulletin in the course  of  the  year.
              Minister Alec Erwin participated in  two  committee  meetings,
              Director-General Dr Alistair Ruiters in six, and several other
              DTI officials in others.


         2.  Legislation


              Seven Bills were referred to the Committee during  the  course
              of the year. The following is a summary of the main provisions
              of the legislation referred to the Committee:


              Copyright and Performers Protection Amendment Bills  (B73  and
              B74-2001) - concluded and enacted during 2002)
              Provides  for  neighbouring  right  ("needle  time")   royalty
              payments to performers in  the  music  industry  and  for  the
              regulation of collecting societies.


              Export Credit and Foreign Investments  Re-Insurance  Amendment
              Bill (B29-2002)
              Amends certain definitions and provisions to  provide  greater
              legal certainty to the operations of the Export Credit  Agency
              in managing  long-term  political  risk  insurance  for  South
              African companies involved in projects abroad.


              Corporate Laws Amendment Bill (B32-2002)
              Provides for electronic payment of fees by companies and close
              corporations; requires the submission of an annual  return  by
              companies and close corporations to enable the  Companies  and
              Intellectual Property Registration Office  (CIPRO)  to  update
              its data base.


              International Trade Administration Bill (B38-2002)
              Establishes a Commission on International Trade Administration
              (CITA) to replace the Board on Tariffs and Trade and  provides
              for CITA to operate in accordance with the provisions  of  the
              revised Southern African Customs  Union  Agreement  (when  the
              latter has force of law in South Africa).


              Merchandise Marks Amendment Bill (B63-2002)
              Provides  for  protection,  particularly  of   organisers   of
              sporting events from "intrusive" ambush marketing.


              Patents Amendment Bill (B64-2002)
              Brings South African legislation in line  with  provisions  of
              the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Law (TRIPS)
              in permitting research by persons other than a patent  holder,
              particularly  in  relation  to  the  production   of   generic
              pharmaceutical products.


         3. Public hearings and oversight activities initiated by Committee
              In addition to public hearings in connection with  Bills,  the
              Committee,  usually  in  cooperation  with  the  NCOP   Select
              Committee, initiated the following activities:


              Public Hearings on Industrial Policy: This was a highlight  of
              the year's activities. The hearings followed  the  publication
              of  the  DTI's  policy  document,  Accelerating   Growth   and
              Development: The Contribution of the Integrated  Manufacturing
              Strategy. The Committees' joint report was  published  in  the
              ATC Bulletin on 6 June 2002 (p 571 onwards) and  a  debate  on
              the report was held in the National Assembly on 21 June, after
              which the Report was adopted by the House.


              A Workshop on Small Business Strategy: This was  held  at  the
              DTI's headquarters in Tshwane ahead of the finalisation of the
              Department's small business policy document.


              Meetings with Department,  IDC,  Khula,  Ntsiki  and  CSIR  in
              connection with 2002-03 budget: A feature of  the  Committee's
              budgetary oversight this year was that it  went  much  further
              and was more extensive than in  previous  years.  Among  other
              things, we received  at  our  request,  and  engaged  with,  a
              detailed report on the extent  to  which  the  Department  had
              achieved the output targets set for it in the 2001-02 budget.


              National  Lottery  distribution  and  Lotteries  policy:   Two
              meetings on this matter were held,  jointly  with  the  Social
              Development Portfolio Committee. Both  attracted  considerable
              public attention.


         4.  Ministerial and departmental briefings
              Briefings  from  the  Ministry,  Department   and   associated
              institutions covered a wide range of topics, and for the first
              time the Committee interacted in the course of the  year  with
              the Department and all institutions that  participate  in  the
              Council of  Trade  and  Industry  Institutions  (COTII).  Some
              highlights of these meetings included:


              Briefings and discussions  on  preparations  for  World  Trade
              Organisation negotiations, as well as on other major  regional
              and bilateral trade issues;


              Revisions to small business strategy;


              Ports policy as an element of micro-economic reform  strategy;
              and


              Oversight of Industrial Participation  Projects  arising  from
              Strategic Defence Procurement Programme.
         5.  Departmental visits


              The Committee paid two oversight visits to the  Department  in
              Tshwane  during  the  year.  These  visits,  which   we   have
              undertaken for  some  years  now,  allow  for  a  particularly
              productive exchange  of  views  and  effective  monitoring  of
              activities of the Department.


         6.  Reports published


              In addition to formal reports on bills, the following  reports
              were prepared and published in the ATC:


              Report on Findings and Recommendations in "Joint Investigating
              Report into the Strategic Defence  Procurements  Packages  (RP
              184/2001)",  Chapter  12,  ATC  Bulletin,  10  December  2001,
              adopted by the National Assembly, 13 August 2002.


              Report of Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry on  Budget
              Vote 31, dated 8 May 2002, ATC Bulletin, 13 May 2002, p 381.


              Report of the Portfolio Committee on  Trade  and  Industry  on
              public hearings on Industrial Policy, dated 5 June  2002,  ATC
              Bulletin, 6 June 2002, adopted by National  Assembly  21  June
              2002.


         7.  In conclusion


              2002 has  been  another  busy  and  productive  year  for  the
              Committee. Several briefings on key policy  papers  which  had
              been planned have, however, had to be held over to next  year.
              These include briefings on:
              * Black Economic Empowerment Strategy document
              * Small Business Strategy document
              * Employment Strategy

              Several Bills that  were  intended  to  be  presented  to  the
              Committee this year have also been held over.


              The Committee's thanks and appreciation are due to a number of
              people who facilitated our work during the course of the year:
              the Minister, Deputy Minister and Director-General,  who  were
              always supportive and available; the Chairperson  and  members
              of the NCOP Select Committee on Economic and Foreign  Affairs,
              with  whom  we  worked  closely  throughout  the   year;   the
              Chairperson of Committees and the Chief  Whip,  who  responded
              positively to a number of requests; all those who participated
              in our activities, and especially to numerous officials of the
              DTI and associated institutions with whom we  interacted;  and
              Saroj Naidoo and  Johan  Strydom,  officials  responsible  for
              Parliamentary Liaison and Legal  Services,  respectively,  who
              ensured  that  communication  with  the  Department  and   the
              organisation of Bills and other meetings proceeded smoothly.
