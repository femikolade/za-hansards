                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Chairperson, at  the  next  sitting  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock the resignation of Hennie Bester as Deputy Leader of
       the Democratic Alliance in the Western Cape and from the Western Cape
       Provincial Legislature;


  (2) believes this resignation to be an expression of Mr Bester's dismay
       and disgust at the failure of the Western Cape Premier and other
       implicated leaders to resign after Absa regional manager Erik Marais
       testified that he laundered donations to the Democratic Alliance;


  (3) reminds the DA/DP that they have made loud noises about corruption
       and accountability but fail to hold themselves to the same standards
       by which they judge others; and


  (4) condemns the DP/DA for their corrupt and hypocritical conduct and
       calls on Mr Morkel, the hon Mr Leon and the hon Mr Gibson to resign
       for their part in this sordid affair.

[Interjections.] [Applause.] [Laughter.]

Mr T D LEE: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that some provincial hospitals in the Eastern Cape are often
       without food for patients and that the condition of some hospital
       buildings increasingly poses a health risk to patients and staff;


  (2) further notes that at the Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth -


       (a)  there are 232 vacancies for nurses;


       (b)  many senior administrative posts are vacant; and


       (c)  nurses regularly have to rely on the generosity of the community
           to be able to feed patients; and


  (3) calls on the ANC provincial government to stop playing games with
       people's lives and to put delivery ahead of party loyalty.

[Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC at the next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay the increase in the levels of gang violence on the
       Cape Flats and the effect it has on learners in these townships; and


  (2) calls upon the Ministers of safety and security and social welfare to
       take urgent steps to address this problem because it will exacerbate
       if steps are not taken.

Mr H P CHAUKE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC at the next
sitting:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Project ``Nexus 2002''  in  the  Swartruggens  and  Koster
       Police  stations  in  the  North  West  province  is   running   very
       successfully;


  (2) applauds community members and sixty police volunteers, who are
       helping the two police stations to bring down the level of crime in
       these areas; and


  (3) calls on other communities to emulate this shining example and be
       volunteers to build safe and secure communities.

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) over many decades the DA and its predecessors, the Democratic Party
       and the Progressive Federal Party, have gone to great lengths to
       cultivate an image of deep-seated respect for the judiciary, of
       upholding due process of law and of being fighters against
       corruption;


  (2) under the leadership of the hon Mr Leon, they have recently managed
       to shatter this image by their inappropriate attack on Judge Desai,
       as chairperson of a commission appointed under the law, in an
       apparent attempt to blot out the message by killing the messenger;
       and


  (3) this action undermines the ideals and visions established by their
       former leaders, like the great Helen Suzman, the late Zach de Beer,
       Colin Eglin and Van Zyl Slabbert.

[Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, I will move on behalf of the UDM at the next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock that seven female teachers of the Little Flower High
       School in Qumbu have been charged with indecent and common assault on
       a 15-year-old schoolgirl for allegedly being in possession of a
       pornographic picture;


  (2) expresses its horror and condemnation that the schoolgirl was
       severely beaten and sexually assaulted with a banana;
  (3) reaffirms its commitment to the principles of human rights as
       entrenched in the Constitution, and specifically related to the
       dignity with which children should be treated; and


  (4) calls on all teachers and education stakeholders to act decisively
       against teachers who undermine the principles of a just and
       responsible democratic society.

Mr M M MASALA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC at the next
sitting:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that the Eastern Cape Premier, Mr Arnold Stofile, is
       frustrated at public servants who do not perform but cannot be fired;


  (2) further notes the commitment of the ANC-led Government in building a
       culture of service which puts the people's interests first (Batho
       Pele) and a public service which is committed to building a better
       life for all people through having a work ethic and delivery of
       service to our people; and


  (3) calls on the public servants in the Eastern Cape to embrace the
       spirit of Batho Pele and to commit themselves to building a better
       life for all our people in South Africa.

[Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek namens
die VF op die volgende sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat dit môre, Vrydag 31 Mei, presies 100 jaar is
       sedert Afrikaners in die Transvaal en Vrystaat hulle vryheid verloor
       het met die beëindiging van die Anglo Boere-oorlog en die
       ondertekening van die Vrede van Vereeniging;


  (2) kennis neem dat tydens hierdie oorlog -


       (a)  as deel van die Britte se verskroeide aarde beleid, 8000
           boereplase afgebrand en oor 'n miljoen stuks vee vernietig is;
           en


       (b)  aan Afrikanerkant, volgens die nuutste navorsing, ongeveer 32
           000 vroue en kinders in die Britse konsentrasiekampe dood is -
           hierdie syfer was 10% van die destydse Afrikanerbevolking in die
           twee Boerestate en dit het beteken dat vir elke Afrikaner-Boer
           wat op die slagveld dood is, sewe vroue en kinders in die
           konsentrasiekampe dood is;


     3) voorts kennis neem van verrigtinge wat Vrydag in Bloemfontein,
        Brandfort en Pretoria plaasvind waar die einde van hierdie oorlog op
        verskillende maniere herdenk sal word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -
  (1) takes note of the fact that tomorrow, Friday 31 May, marks exactly
       100 years since Afrikaners in the Transvaal and the Free State lost
       their freedom with the end of the Anglo-Boer War and the signing of
       the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging;


  (2) takes note that during this war -


       (a)  as part of the scorched earth policy of the British, 8000 boer
           farms were burnt down and more than a million livestock were
           killed; and


       (b)  according to the latest research, approximately 32 000 Afrikaner
           women and children died in the British concentration camps -
           this figure was 10% of the Afrikaner population at the time in
           the two Boer states and this meant that for every Afrikaner-Boer
            who died on the battlefield, seven women and children died in
           the concentration camps; and


       (3)  furthermore takes note of the functions taking place on Friday
           in Bloemfontein, Brandfort and Pretoria where the end of this
           war will be commemorated in different ways.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chair, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of Azapo:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the success of national elections in Lesotho and the peaceful
       way in which such elections took place;


  (2) further notes that some opposition parties have objected to the
       outcome of the elections, even after the elections have been declared
       free and fair by SADEC;


  (3) congratulates the people of Lesotho for conducting their elections
       without violence and intimidation; and


  (4) urges all parties in Lesotho to accept the outcome of the elections
       after the final audit.
[Applause.]

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE: I shall move on behalf of the ANC at the next meeting:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of Education, Prof Kader Asmal's proposals
       for the transformation and reconstruction of higher education have
       been endorsed by the Cabinet;


  (2) further notes that the proposals, which will impact on every
       institution regardless of history, form the basis for the renewal and
       total transformation of the higher education system away from the
       shameful legacy of our apartheid past to one which meets our nation's
       developmental and equity needs;


  (3) believes that the implementation of these proposals will lead to the
       development of truly South African institutions, whose culture and
       ethos will reflect the values of our democracy;


  (4) calls on all parties to give careful consideration to the proposals
       and to put their vested interests aside, by placing the aspirations
       of our young people, particularly those who have been denied access
       in the past, above all else; and


  (5) further calls on all South Africans to lend their full support to
       Government's transformation agenda.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Mr Chairman, I wish to give notice that I shall move at
the next sitting:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that in his speech resigning from public life Mr Hennie Bester
       paid tribute to the hon Tony Leon and expressed his full support both
       for his national leader and for the DA as well as his complete faith
       in Mr Leon's integrity;


  (2) notes further that too many good young people from all parties are
       being lost to public life because of the gutter level to which our
       politics has descended; and
  (3) regrets the comments by the Renier Schoemans of this world who are so
       politically bankrupt that they cruelly and irresponsibly exploit
       someone else's pain.

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Mr Chairman, I wish to give notice that I shall move at
the next sitting:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes with gratitude the German grant agreed upon by the Director-
       General of Minerals and Energy and the senior vice-president of the
       German development bank to provide solar energy panels to at least
       300 000 South African households;


  (2) realises that these panels will make life easier for rural  and  poor
       families of the Eastern Cape and North West and of SA as a whole  who
       are inconvenienced by either collecting  heating  wood  from  faraway
       places or lack of such wood; and


  (3) hopes that such a grant will extend to other poor communities.
Mr I Z NCINANE: Mr Chairperson, I shall move at the  next  sitting  of  this
House on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Mr Alf Buqwana, a top South African boxing official, has
       been appointed as a judge for the upcoming Lennox Lewis and Mike
       Tyson World Heavyweight Title bout;


  (2) recognises Alf Buqwana's appointment as a judge in this all-important
       boxing bout as an historic achievement for the South African boxing
       official; and


  (3) congratulates Alf Buqwana on his appointment and wishes him all of
       the best in this very important function.

[Applause.]

Mr I J PRETORIUS: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the honourable Mr Leon has received the second resignation of a
           senior leader of his party in less than 10 days;


       (b)  Carl Werth, the former Gauteng North leader of the DA, was the
           first senior leader to resign and yesterday Mr Hennie Bester,
           deputy leader of the DA in the Western Cape, followed his lead;


       (c)  this confirms the disillusionment amongst the senior leadership
           of the honourable Mr Leon's party; and


       (d)  Mr Hennie Bester was the DA's crown prince and was groomed to
           take over from Mr Leon;


  (2) acknowledges that these senior leaders in the DA are now actually
       doing what Mr Leon and others involved in the Harksen scandal should
       have done, and that is to resign; and
  (3) is of the opinion that after the floor-crossing legislation has been
       enacted, many other members of Mr Leon's party will follow suit.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Ms ANNA VAN WYK: Chairperson, I will move on behalf of the UDM at the next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) learns with shock of the latest research conducted by doctors at the
       Red Cross Children's Hospital regarding the reasons for brain damage
       in their child patients;


  (2) expresses its horror that between June 1998 and June 2001 the doctors
       treated 75 child patients who suffered brain damage due to violence;


  (3) notes with dismay that the vast majority of these children were
       younger than 12 months old;


  (4) expresses specifically its contempt that it appears that in 40% of
       these cases the children were the victims of assault because the
       attacker, usually a male family member, was aiming to assault the
       mother carrying the child;


  (5) condemns in the strongest possible terms the occurrence of domestic
       violence, especially against children so young and vulnerable; and


  (6) calls upon the Minister of Safety and Security to ensure the
       immediate and effective implementation of the Domestic Violence Act.

[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Mr Chairperson, I move without

         Democracy;


     (2)    congratulates the people of Lesotho on holding peaceful

         southern hemisphere near Sutherland;


     (2)    notes that the Southern Africa Large Telescope is a local
         project which has established South Africa in the eyes of
         astronomers world-wide; and


     (3)    wishes them success in their project.

Agreed to.

                        POSITIVE ECONOMIC INDICATORS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr C H F GREYLING: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House notes that -


     (1)    the rand appreciated to its best level in six months against the
         dollar;


     (2)    the gold price increased to a five-year high; and
     (3)    the gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2,2 per cent during the
         first quarter.

                 AFRICA, THE TIME HAS COME! AFRIKA, KE NAKO!

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Dr Z P JORDAN: Mr Chairperson, hon members  and  comrades,  as  the  African
continent prepares for  the  inaugural  summit  of  the  African  Union,  an
observer could not be blamed for regarding ours  as  an  extremely  troubled
continent.

During the last decade of the twentieth century Africa accounted for  53  of
the armed conflicts in the world. Even  more  troubling  is  that  the  vast
majority of these were  not  interstate  conflicts  but,  invariably,  civil
wars. A terrifying dimension of these wars is that  they  can  be  conducted
even in the absence of high-tech weapons systems.

South Africa is at peace today, but we must be deeply  concerned  about  the
state of the continent because we do not want to see  a  further  escalation
of violence in Africa. As an African state, our concern is driven  by  self-
interest  and  we  must  readily  accept  that  Africa's  problems  are  our
problems.

Conflict situations necessarily entail loss of life and the destruction of
infrastructure. Conflicts also require governments to divert resources away
from social spending programmes to security. That is an excess which no
African people can afford. In some parts of the continent the state has
imploded, leaving ordinary people prey to ruthless warlords and adventurers
intent on self-enrichment.

Yet it would be radically wrong to view Afica as a picture of unmitigated
gloom and doom. Between 1990 and 1999, more competitive elections were held
in Africa than in Asia and the Pacific. Elections have just been concluded
in Lesotho and Sierra Leone, two countries that have lived through
extremely difficult times over the past decade.

The region with the lowest number of elections in the world was the Middle
East.

Though the progress of democracy in Africa is slow, it has become an
established trend. The uneven pace of democratisation in Africa owes its
progress, as during the struggle for independence, to the efforts of
ordinary citizens and political activists who have occupied and expanded
democratic space within their societies as a means of placing critical
social policy issues on the public agenda.

Contrary to the view held by some misguided pundits, it is not to its
former colonial masters that Africa owes its democratic institutions. Those
who actually experienced colonialism know that the colonised people had no
rights. They were not citizens; they were colonial subjects, governed by an
entirely separate system of law from the colonists.

Incalculable mischief was also wrought in these societies by the so-called
``experts'' in native culture, native law, anthropology, customary law, all
of whom corrupted indigenous legal systems to suit the needs of the
colonial administrations. Unaccountable, arbitrary power was the hallmark
of every colonial administration. This power was usually wielded with a
great deal of discretion in pursuance of metropolitan vested interests.

The end of the second millennium coincided with the emergence of a new
generation of African leaders. Many of them had been steeled in the harsh
school of underground resistance, political exile, imprisonment, armed and
mass struggles against colonialists and racist states. Many had also gone
through these experiences struggling against postcolonial states of some 30
or 40 years' standing. Nurtured on the postcolonial experiences of Asia and
Africa, they have known the elation brought about by great successes, as
well as the bitter disappointment that accompanies dismal failure.

The thrust for good governance and democracy in Africa deserves the sort of
support that will beget long-term institutional development. The pan-
African human rights instruments and other institutions envisaged in the
African Union should lend the process greater momentum. Their very
existence will lend greater legitimacy to the institutions designed to
support democracy in individual African nations.

The norms and standards of good governance that the African Union will
adopt, and the peer review mechanism directed at ensuring the observance of
these norms and standards, have also put governments on notice that they
will be held accountable, not solely by their own people, but by the
continent as a whole.

Bread and freedom are not mutually exclusive alternatives. Ordinary African
citizens have begun to emphasise that they are mutually dependent.
Democracy should not be embraced by us because such institutions will
impress foreign powers and international donor organisations. We should
embrace and promote it for its intrinsic value. Democracy creates an
environment in which the objectives of social equity, inclusion, unity and
a human rights culture can be pursued without recourse to
extraconstitutional means.

Confronting what many Africans perceive as a hostile economic order will
only be possible with the organised support of common African people.
Governments that enjoy legitimacy and a popular mandate are better able to
speak to outsiders with authority.

The apparent respectability discredited ideas from the past have acquired
is exemplified by the electoral successes registered by parties of the
radical right in Europe. The increased support for charismatic and
fundamentalist Christianity in the United States can justly take credit for
shifting the mainstream of US politics to the right. The upsurge of an
aggressive US nationalism post September 11 has reinforced such trends.

African leaders, inspired by the vision of an African Renaissance, have
placed before the continent and the international community the New
Partnership for Africa's Development, Nepad, with a view to harnessing the
human and natural resources of the continent, for its renewal and
reconstruction. The development of Africa's infrastructure, the roll-out of
modern telecommunications networks, securing better terms of trade,
democratic governance and the cancellation of debts, are at the centre of
Nepad. Though politically independent, today Africa's sovereignty is
threatened by indebtedness to banks and international aid donors. Nepad can
galvanise a collective response to this threat.

Encouraging a substantial increase in capital flows into Africa and
reversing the trend of donor fatigue are but two aspects of this programme.
United action on a number of different fronts can also open up the markets
of developed countries to African raw materials, agricultural produce and
beneficiated goods, while facilitating the transfer of technology to
African countries. Synergies, through which variously endowed African
countries can pool their strengths, will also be an important dimension of
Nepad, enabling Africans to mobilise their own savings and the capital
reserves on the continent for its development.

While the increasing momentum of Africa's reconstruction is grounds for
optimism, there are new dangers in the international arena which require
our attention. As we mark Africa Day this year, we may take pride in the
role that South Africa has played at the forefront to achieve political
stability and peace as preconditions for the regeneration of the African
continent. South Africa has done this not by bullying, hectoring and
coercion, but by judicious interventions and by patient dialogue with our
African neighbours. These efforts are at the centre of our foreign policy
and they will continue.

Afrika, ke nako! Africa's moment has, indeed, arrived. [Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson and hon members, the heading of our topic or
subject today encapsulates quite a number of subsubjects, such as
celebrating Africa Day, belated as it may seem, the envisaged African Union
assembly and Nepad, or the initiative for a New Partnership for Africa's
Development. All these complementary visionary objectives are worthy ideas
whose time has indeed come.

Nako e fitlile, ammaaruri e gorogile. [Time has indeed come.]

Taking into account the long journey and the time it has taken Africa to
arrive at this point in the 21st century, I am tempted to break into some
epic song on behalf of Mother Africa. William Henley's Invictus seems to be
my immediate and nearest vehicle. Mother Africa might be saying, and I
quote:


  Out of the night that covers me,
  Black as the pit from pole to pole,
  I thank whatever gods may be
  For my unconquerable soul.


  It matters not how strait the gate,
  How charged with punishments the scroll,
  I am the master of my fate:
  I am the captain of my soul.

Africa Day, African Unity, African Renaissance and the New Partnership for
Africa's Development, amongst other things, are historical beacons and
culminations in the long journey, both of the evolutionary and
revolutionary African or pan-african process, a historical journey fraught
with setbacks, yet blessed with tenacious hope.

Illustrious names involved in this pan-African journey come to mind - the
Marcus Garveys, the George Padmores, the Kwame Nkrumas, the Mzwake
Lembedes, the Sobukwes, to name but a few of the forerunners and
torchbearers.

It is a great pity that, on an occasion such as Africa Day, we still have
to be subjected to such a restrictive time allocation, making it difficult
to sketch out our long history, connecting the yesteryear to the present in
our great march to the future. That is our version of ``botho'' or
``ubuntu'', which is the concept of sharing; in this case, sharing
resources and time.

That being the case, let me hasten to allude to the current African
vision's fulcrum, that is, Nepad. One cannot ask for more than the stated
ingredients or elements of this partnership such as, and I quote:


  ... a partnership based on mutual respect, dignity, shared responsibility
  and mutual accountability.

I wish to cite the expected outcomes of this initiative, namely economic
growth and development, leading to increased employment, diversification of
productive activities, reduction of poverty and inequality, enhanced
international competitiveness and increased exports, and increased African
integration.

These are worthy, sound ideals and objectives, but cannot come into being
on their own. In the light of such convictions, Africa needs to take stock
that -


  Convictions that go unquestioned, however, divide human beings from one
  another. Those holding them become hard and self-enclosed, distorted
  embodiments of the quality we call humanity. To think, we must question
  our convictions, and overcome the contempt we often feel for those whose
  convictions differ from our own.

That quote is from Glen Tindal.

Each African country or partner has to take every responsibility to create
conducive conditions and good governance within their own respective
countries to make Nepad the success story it deserves to be. It will take
more than rhetoric and costly jamborees to achieve the desired goals. The
chain will depend on the strength of each link, so to say. Each African
state must uphold honour and adhere to agreements, protocols and
fundamental democratic tenets and principles. Respect for human dignity,
human rights and the sanctity of life should be foremost in a peaceful and
stable environment. Dictatorships and despotism must not be allowed to take
root.

I wish to conclude with the words of a son of ours, Mothobi Mutloatse, who,
in his reconstruction anthology, says:


  And, take note, today you are in power; tomorrow, you may be after power
  again, having lost it through your greediness and abuse of basic human
  dignity.

[Applause.]
Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Sihalo neNdlu ehloniphekile, ngifisa ukuthi sizibuze

sesifikile-ke bese kuletha injabulo engaphezu kwalokho.

Mangisho ukuthi kuzofuneka ukuthi namhlanje sibuke ukuthi sisuka kuphi,
sikuphi futhi siyaphi. Kule Ndlu esikuyo namhlanje sike sadingida izindaba
eziningi eziphatha izindaba zase-Afrika. Okunye kwezinto esizidingidile
sidingide nge-African Renaissance, sabuye sathinta i-African Unity kanye
neNepad. Umbuzo-ke obuzakalayo lapha emazingeni phansi owokuthi,
sekushiyelwani ku-OAU, kuyiwaphi manje, i-African Unity iyini neNepad
iyini? Engifisa ukukugcizelela ukuthi sidinga ukuthi senze uhlelo lokwazisa
abantu ukuthi kuyini lokhu esikhuluma ngakho.
Mangithinte ezinye zezinto ezinjengokuthi nje i-Afrika inomnotho omningi
ovela ezintweni zayo ezimbiwa phansi. Ngakho-ke kufanele ukuthi lokhu
kunotha kwe-Afrika kwandiswe kuye kubantu bonke, kungathi ezinye izindawo
ezise-Afrika zibuke iNingizimu Afrika njengobhuti omkhulu lapho kufanele
zizothola khona usizo oluthile. Kufanele ukuthi ukwandiswa komnotho
kudlulele nakuzo, amasiko ethu e-Afrika wonkana avuselelwe, siyazi
imvelaphi yethu. Kuyinhlamba kithina uqobo ukuthi sihloniphe uQeen Victoria
nxa efike lapha kodwa sibe singakwazi ukuhlonipha ubukhosi bakithi.

Izilimi zabantu kufanele zivuselelwe kulabo ababecindezelwe. Kukhona amazwe
namhlanje akhuluma isiFulentshi nesiPhuthukezi, abangalwazi ulimi lwabo
lwemvelo nokuthi kwakunguluphi ngempela ulimi okwakufanele balukhulume.
Ngakho-ke kuhle  kubuyiselwe konke lokhu kube ngamagugu okuthi abantu
bakwazi ukukuthokozela ukuba se-Afrika.

Sifuna ukwazi maqondana nohlamvu lwemali lwe-Afrika, izinhlamvu zemali
ezisetshenziswa lapha e-Afrika zingaphezu kuka-50 futhi azilingani. Uyaye
uthole ukuthi mhlawumbe uhlamvu olusetshenziswa iNamibia, iNingizimu Afrika
kanye neSwazini kuyalingana nabanye kodwa kwezinye izindawo kube kuphansi.
Kuthathe isikhathi eside ukuthi iYurophu ize izofika kulesi sikhathi
sokuthi ibe nohlamvu olulodwa ekwazi ukuthi ikhulume ithi banalo. Ngakho-ke
nathi kuzosithatha isikhathi ukuba kuze kufike lapho sizoba khona nohlamvu
esizokwazi ukulusebenzisa.

Ngifuna ukuba ngithinte nokuthi abesifazane-ke bona uma sekukhulunywa
ngokuthi isikhathi sesifikile, kubaphatheleni lokhu njengabesifazane bethu
base-Afrika na? Mangidlulise ukuthokoza ukuthi la kunamantombazane
ahambileyo awuhlanganisa umhlanganiso le beyokhuluma izindaba
zokuhlanganisa ikakhulukazi kuSADC. Kukhona ilungu elihloniphekile uNksz
Lulu Xingwana benodadewethu uProf Ngubane, ilungu elihloniphekile,
abanikezwe isihlalo sokuba uSihlalo kuSADC yonkana. Sebeyivulile-ke
indlela. [Ihlombe.] Ngakho-ke masibavulele indlela ngalokho ngoba
sebezwakalisile ukuthi impela sesiyayivula indlela siya phambili.

Ngifisa ukuba kuzwakaliswe ukuthi njengoba sikhuluma ngomnotho,  sesizoba
nazo yini izimpahla ezibhalwe ukuthi `made in Africa' ngoba izipuni zami
zonke zibhalwe ukuthi `made in England', ezinye `made in Switzerland'? Ake
kube khona manje isikhathi lapho sizogcina sesiba nempahla yethu nje
esizoke siziqhenye ngayo ethi, `made in Africa'.

Okunye futhi engifuna ukukusho ukuthi uma umuntu ebuka amanye amazwe uyaye
akwazi ukubona ukuthi lo muntu uvela kuphi, mhlawumbe uvela eNigeria.
Ngithokozile ngibona ubaba lapha, uNgqongqoshe wethu womNyango wezokuThutha
eqhamuka, kwabonakala ukuthi saqhamuka njenge-Afrika, ngisho into
enjengaleyo. Kufanele sibonakale njenge-Afrika uma siqhamuka ukuthi
yaqhamuka-ke i-Afrika. Kufanele kube khona okubonakala ngakho.

Umama uhleze nje ebonakala ukuthi uyasimelela laphaya esihlalweni. Awukaze
umbone enza okunye kodwa usuke emelele thina njenge-Afrika. Ake senzeni
ukuthi kube khona okubonakalayo nokushoyo ukuthi singobani. Ngisho simelele
i-Afrika kufanele kubonakale ukuthi baqhamuka abamelele i-Afrika,
angisakhulumi nangeNingizimu Afrika kodwa i-Afrika yonkana. Makube khona
into esizobonakala ngayo. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson and honourable House, I would like us to ask
ourselves today what it means to say the time has come. Mothers know what
this means. When they say the time has come, one expects to give birth to a
child; one expects the arrival of happiness. Therefore, the coming of the
time means the arrival of happiness, and one expects it and also other
things that may follow.

I am not talking about the present situation, where people see in the scan
what kind of child she will give birth to. During our time we did not know
what kind of baby one was going to give birth to. One just waited for the
time to come and when it arrived it produced greater happiness.

I would like to say that today we need to see where we come from, where we
are and where we are going. In this House we discussed many issues that
deal with Africa. Another thing that we discussed was the African
Renaissance. We also talked about African Unity and Nepad. The question
that is asked at the lower levels of society is why we left the OAU. Where
are we going now? What is African unity and what is Nepad? What I would
like to stress is that we need to formulate a structure through which we
will inform people what we are talking about.

Let me talk about something like saying Africa has a lot of economic
activity which originates from mineral resources. Therefore the wealth of
Africa should be distributed to all people so as to avoid a situation where
other parts of Africa look at South Africa as a big brother from whom they
can get certain assistance. The wealth should be extended to these areas
and all our cultures should be developed and we should know our background.

It is an insult to us to respect Queen Elizabeth when she visits here,
while we are failing to respect our own traditional leadership.

Languages of those who were previously disadvantaged should be developed.
There are countries today where people speak French and Portuguese, while
they do not know their own natural languages. They do not know exactly what
language they should have spoken. Therefore all that should be brought back
so that they will be treasures that people will enjoy in Africa.

We want to know about African coins used in Africa. There are more than 50
coins used in Africa and they are not equal in value. One finds that the
Namibian, South African and Swazi coins are equal but in some areas their
value is less. It took Europe a long time to get to the point where it has
one coin so that when they speak, they know they all have the same money.
Therefore, it is going to take us a long time to reach the point where we
will have one coin that we can use.

I also want to ask what it means to African women when one talks about the
fact that the time has come. I would like to pass on the message of
appreciation of the fact that these girls who have left went to talk about
unity, especially in the SADC region. There were the hon Ms Lulu Xingwana
and my sister hon Prof Ngubane, and they were given a chairpersonship of
SADC as a whole. They have paved the way. [Applause.] Therefore, let us
open the way for them, because they have shown that we are opening up the
way forward.

I would like to ask, as we are talking about the economy, whether we are
going to have goods stamped "Made in Africa", because all my spoons at home
are stamped "Made in England" and some say, "Made in Switzerland". Now
there should be a time when we will have our own property that we will be
proud of and which will be stamped "Made in Africa".

Another thing that I would like to mention is that when one looks at other
countries one can see where this person comes from, maybe Nigeria. I was
pleased to see that father the Minister for the Department of Transport, as
he approached the room, could clearly be seen to come from Africa. I am
talking about things like this. We should be seen as from Africa when we
approach people so that they will say:"Here comes Africa."  There should be
something that distinguishes us.

Mother Madam Speaker is always seen to be original in that chair. One
cannot see her doing anything but representing us as Africa. Let us do
things that will be visible and that will describe who we are. Even when we
represent Africa, when we approach, people should see that these ones
represent Africa. I am not talking about South Africa only but the whole of
Africa. There should be something that distinguishes us. [Applause.]]

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Mr Chairperson, Madam Speaker - I think I can address you
even if you are sitting there - comrades and colleagues, May 25, since
1963, will always be a day to remember, not just as the day of an event but
as the day when a clarion call was made to us, as Africans, to assume
responsibility for our lives and the wellbeing of our continent.

Indeed, we are grateful for the vision and dreams of our leaders. For that,
we give no sacrament of a eucharistic or any other kind, nor do we
contemplate elements to each other. Of course, we praise and proclaim, but
more than this, we give promise that we shall fulfil by our actions and
deeds those dreams and that vision for the assertion of the African
personality.

This assertion made in Accra, under the leadership of Dr Kwame Nkrumah in
1958, resonates with our own assertion of, firstly, being African and,
secondly, that we shall be free to act in our individual and collective
interest at any particular time. We shall also be able to exert our
influence on the side of peace and uphold the rights of all peoples to
decide for themselves their own forms of government, as well as the right
of all peoples, regardless of race, colour or creed, to live their own
lives in freedom without fear.

For us in the ANC, historically, this vision is aptly projected. Even
though we as a country did not participate in the Addis Ababa conference,
the oppressed masses of our country celebrated the event. I should know,
because in July 1963, in the Great Hall at Wits, I had the historical
privilege to argue that the OAU was an attempt to transcend its specific
physical and intellectual environment without pulling out the roots that
must nourish it. It was committed, even though all of Africa was not free
at the time, to creating a force for world peace, unity and development.

This was a dynamic political creed. Such a creed, it was envisioned, would
express itself through that kind of personality which would embrace the
qualities of a person, both as a citizen of Africa and as a member of the
human race. With regard to those parts of Africa which were still bound and
repressed, the OAU and the leadership of the Nkrumahs, Nassers, Mandelas,
Nyereres, Kaundas and a host of others were extremely active and vital.

These leaders entered into a covenant and drew up a charter which called
for the freedom and emancipation of the entire continent. It called upon
Africans to consolidate their newly won independence, and to create and
defend the conditions of peace, security and sustainability. They did not
go to seek any mandate from any quarter to do this. They committed their
countries to these responsibilities because these duties, in my view, were
impregnated in the crucible of Africa's consciousness since the days of
slavery, colonialism and apartheid.

With the installation of democracy in our country in 1994, the vision of a
politically free continent was realised. We salute the visionaries of the
OAU, the frontline states, the United Nations, the Nonaligned Movement and
sections of the international community, among others. In the words of
President Mbeki, we give thanks to all these horses, but especially the
OAU, for Africa to have arrived. We give thanks to the current political
leadership in Africa who have made the emergence of the African Union
possible, together with the programme of Nepad, as an essential part of the
second revolution in our continent.

The cynics amongst us, whose bodies are here but whose souls are elsewhere,
pretending to be objective, often invoke the question of sovereignty. They
should learn from the declaration of fundamental principles of the Ghanaian
constitution, which reads:


  The union of Africa should be striven for by every lawful means, and when
  attained, it should be faithfully preserved. The independence of Ghana
  should not be surrendered or diminished on any grounds other than the
  furtherance of African unity.

To the best of my knowledge, this was the first time that a sovereign state
voluntarily offered to surrender its sovereignty for the purpose of a
larger unity. The constitutions of Guinea, Tunisia, Mali and the UAR
subsequently also contain similar provisions. Outside of the invocation of
Nkosi Sikelel'iAfrika, I humbly say that perhaps it would have been
propitious for us to include this in the preamble of our own Constitution.

With this cursory glimpse at the continent's history, we ask: What is it
that we have to do to celebrate Africa Day today? The intensification of
our vision to strive for peace, stability, democracy and sustainable
development on an African continent which will be nonsexist, prosperous and
united, thereby contributing towards a world that is just and equitable, is
our primary foreign policy option.

Our continuous struggle towards this objective as Africans will be a
salutary ongoing celebration and thanksgiving. The four clusters of the
Nepad programme are pretty well circulated amongst us. The African Union is
equally well understood by us.

This afternoon I choose a few issues to reflect on, and to ask ourselves
whether our commissions and/or omissions do justice to or obstruct the
regeneration of Africa. If the unity and strength of Africa are dependent
on the unity and strength of her component parts, Africans and South
Africans need to ask whether the current form of globalisation that
entrenches Africa's marginalisation in the world economy is conducive to
our revitalisation; whether the eurocentric cartels controlling gold,
diamonds, cocoa, copper, uranium, pulp and paper and a host of other
African resources are conducive to the growth and development of our
continent; whether the emergence of religious intolerance, the confessional
state, terrorism linked to it and world domination by any one faith system,
as seen in the Sudan, are compatible with the unity and stability of our
continent; whether xenophobia and ethnic intolerance and cleansing
facilitate African unity; whether it is enough for religious institutions
of any faith to engage in evangelism, proselytising and conversions with
total disregard for the socioeconomic conditions of the poorest of the
poor; whether it is right for students to exercise their rights over the
rights of others, not only abusing their privileged positions as students,
but also destroying the property of others and even the infrastructure made
possible by the state; whether it is correct for nurses and health workers
in state hospitals in particular to down tools at the expense of the ill,
the disabled and the aged; and whether it is correct for teachers to
disregard their duties and to abuse children when a major part of Africa is
seized by illiteracy and ignorance?

If our answers are no to all these agonising questions, then the ANC would
urge all South Africans to equip themselves with knowledge of the African
Union protocols; the vision of Nepad; international protocols, like the one
pioneered by President Mbeki with the Nordic states; the Windhoek
Declaration on behalf of SADC; and all other relevant documents to
facilitate our understanding and jolt us into action, wherever we are, to
make possible the renaissance of our continent.

It will not be an exaggeration to state here that the rest of Africa is
looking towards South Africa in this regard, especially because of the
manner in which we succeeded in attaining our democracy. With Africa always
in mind, we have also placed ourselves, under the leadership of President
Mbeki, as a principal player in global issues such as the recent World
Trade Organisation's conference, the democratisation of the Security
Council, the Conference against Racism, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,
the African Union Summit to be held in Durban, and the World Summit on
Sustainable Development to be held in Johannesburg.

Since this is the position that our country, under the leadership of the
ANC, has come to occupy on the world stage, it is not too much for us to
ask of ourselves a citizenship, within our society, which will be rooted in
co-operation and not in vulgar, acquisitive competition. Towards this end
Africa needs a new type of citizen, a dedicated, modest, honest and
informed person, a person who submerges himself or herself in service to
the nation and mankind, a man who abhors greed and detests vanity, a new
type of man whose humility is his strength and whose integrity his
greatness.
I wanted to end with the words ``Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika''. But in
conclusion, if the House will spare me another half a minute, I would like
to make a plea to my youthful compatriots in South Africa. All of those who
are 18 and under knew nothing in 1994 about democracy, freedom or justice.
Freedom, democracy and justice were not given to us on a plate. I wish to
remind my compatriots, youthful people, black and white, that we struggled
for these things for centuries. The democracy and freedom that they enjoy
are what their forebears have fought for and died for, with ``Mayibuye
iAfrika'' on their lips, and in their souls.

If they think the destruction of our schools and of the infrastructure at
our universities is revolutionary, they are wrong. Their ancestors invoked
``Mayibuye iAfrika'' in struggling to free Africa. Can these young people
honestly invoke ``Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika'' when they are hurting her every
day?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I regret even that injury
time has expired.

Mr M RAMGOBIN: We had the strength of character to proclaim that the
Verwoerds, Mobutos, Savimbis, Tshombes and others hurt and disunited
Africa. Let us stand firm and abstain from hurting Mother Africa, and let
her awake and take her rightful place in the world. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, usually I do not agree with anything the
previous speaker said, but today is an exception. I agree with everything
he said, except for one thing; I do not think that globalisation
necessarily has negative consequences for Africa. I think Africa should
utilise globalisation to its own benefit.

The subject for today's discussion is ``Africa the time has come'', ``ke
nako''. If the 21st century is to belong to Africa, as envisaged by
President Mbeki, the time has come for Africa to accept responsibility for
its own destiny.

Many obstacles to African development are legacies of the past, but Africa
cannot afford to continue blaming others for its underdevelopment. The time
has come for Africa to accept responsibility for its own future.

The eradication of poverty is the biggest challenge facing the continent.
According to Osama bin Laden, the prophet Mohammed once said: ``A woman
entered hell because of a cat. She did not feed it and prevented it from
finding food on its own.'' Now if a woman went to hell because she starved
a cat, then five sixths of the world's population are straight on their way
to hell because one sixth of the world's population go hungry every day.

The situation is worse on the African continent, where 46,3% of the
population live on less than a dollar a day. The UN Millennium Summit
resolved to halve the world's poor by 2015. Africa south of the Sahara
needs an annual growth rate of about 8% to achieve this objective.
Therefore, economic development is the only answer to eradicating poverty.
The engine that will drive economic development is, undoubtedly, the New
Partnership for Africa's Development.

The time has come for Africa to meet its part of the agreement which
entails the following: The time has come for Africa to produce the kind of
leadership - Mr Ramgobin must listen before leaving the House - that will
meet the demands of globalisation. Dapo Oyewole, special projects officer
at the Centre for Democracy and Development in London, said that
globalisation requires skilled leaders who are adept at defending and
promoting their country's interests in the international arena,  because
one inordinate utterance or action could send the country's economy
plunging. And, of course, President Mugabe of Zimbabwe clearly does not
understand this.

The time has come for Africa to pursue good governance based on democratic
and free-market principles. Good governance, as everybody knows, is a
prerequisite for foreign direct investment without which economic
development will remain a pipe dream.

Furthermore, the time has come for Africa to end all armed conflicts, which
are detrimental to economic development. Zimbabwe's military excursion into
the Democratic Republic of the Congo cost that country more than 1 million
US dollars a day, whilst the population was starving. Rumours have it that
the sole purpose of this involvement is to protect President Mugabe's
personal diamond interests in that country.

Nobody will invest in a war-torn region. No wonder those countries plagued
by armed conflicts have the lowest economic growth rates on the continent.
Angola has a growth rate of only 0,2%. Hopefully this will improve
tremendously now that peace has dawned upon that country. The growth rate
of Burundi is currently -2,4%, that of the DRC is -4,6%, and that of Rwanda
is - 2,1%. Sierra Leone, which had elections but is still affected by the
war, has a -4,6% growth rate.

If the time has come for Africa to meet its part of the agreement, with a
view to enhancing economic growth and promoting the eradication of poverty,
the time has also come for the developed world to honour their part of the
agreement. The time has therefore come for the developed world to open up
their markets for Africa's products.

The African Growth and Opportunity Act of the USA is a fine example of how
developing countries can benefit from free trade. In terms of this Act,
countries which have committed themselves to good governance may export
their goods to the USA duty free. Since the implementation of the Act,
South Africa has earned more than 1,7 billion US dollars and thousands of
new jobs have been created.

Textile imports alone increased by US 989 million in one year, and I think
the other 35 countries that qualify for duty free exports to the USA in
terms of the Act should follow South Africa's example.

The time has come for the developed world to write off the debt of the 33
highly indebted poor African countries. Many countries spend far more on
servicing foreign debt than on education and health. Cancelling the debt of
41 highly indebted poor countries will cost about US$400 million annually.
This is far less than the grants paid to only 16 European countries under
the Marshall Plan.

The time has come for the developed world to channel foreign direct
investment to African shores, which currently only receive 3% of global
foreign direct investment flowing to developing countries. Without
investment, Africa will never reach the required growth rate necessary for
the eradication of poverty.

Once Africa and the developed world have both accepted their obligations in
terms of the New Agreement for Africa's Development, the 21st century will
belong to Africa.

Vroeër vanmiddag het die leier van die VF, dr Pieter Mulder, 'n mosie
ingedien wat verband hou met 31 Mei, wat môre is. Dit is die dag waarop die
Vrede van Vereeniging herdenk word. Ek dink dit is gepas dat hy so 'n mosie
ingedien het. Afrikaners het hulself nog altyd beskou as deel van Afrika,
en daarom is dit ook goed om op 'n dag soos hierdie, waarop die debat oor
Afrika gaan, daarna te verwys.

Hierdie oorlog was die eerste bevrydingstryd teen 'n koloniale moontheid op
die kontinent van Afrika, en dit was die begin van 'n bevrydingsproses wat
uiteindelik uitgeloop het op 27 April 1994, toe al die mense van Suid-
Afrika bevry is. Ons wil graag ook hulde bring aan almal wat in dié oorlog
gesterf het. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Earlier this afternoon the leader of the FF, Dr Pieter Mulder, moved a
motion in connection with 31 May, which is tomorrow. That is the day on
which the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging is commemorated. I think it is
fitting that he should move such a motion. Afrikaners have always regarded
themselves as being part of Africa and therefore it is also fitting on a
day such as this, when the debate is about Africa, to refer to that.

That war was the first war against a colonial power on the African
continent and it was the start of a liberation process which was eventually
concluded on 27 April 1994, when all of the people of South Africa were
liberated. We would also like to pay tribute to everyone who died in that
war. [Applause.]]

Dr F N GINWALA: Chairperson, hon members, 25 May last week marked the 39th
anniversary of Africa Unity Day - the anniversary of the adoption of the
charter and the formation of the Organisation of African Unity.

Six weeks from today, at the inaugural summit of 53 heads of state and
government in Durban, the African Union will take over from the
Organisation of African Unity.

Our debate today comes at this very significant moment in the history of
building unity on the African continent, a process that began more than 100
years ago. But before we look ahead, we need to pay tribute to the
Organisation of African Unity. South Africans in particular, and indeed
much of colonised Africa, owe a tremendous debt to this organisation. It
had as one of its founding missions the total liberation of the continent
of Africa.

The OAU united the continent in political support of the liberation
struggles in all colonies. It lobbied, made representations and presented a
unified African voice in international fora in support of decolonisation
and the strategies of the various liberation movements, negotiations,
sanctions, international isolation as well as armed action.

Through its Liberation Committee based in Dar-es-Salaam, it gave us more
direct and material support. That today, the Parliament of South Africa is
fully representative and composed of the elected representatives of the
entire population of this country is in no small measure due to the support
of the African continent mobilised through the Organisation of African
Unity.

When the charter was adopted in 1963, the representatives of the liberation
movements were there, but we were there as observers. The white minority
government could not subscribe to it.
This year, democratic South Africa becomes a founding member of the African
Union and President Mbeki will assume office as the chairperson of that
union.

Africa's time has indeed come, but it must be a time for action, because
the time for action is long overdue. With the formation of the African
Union, we face new challenges - shaped by the 21st century. This requires
of us honest retrospection and a frank assessment of the causes of Africa's
impoverishment. The assessment needs to look at Africa's achievements as
well as its failures, and the global environment in which we are now
operating.

The African Union and the New Partnership for Africa's Development have
been shaped by such a process, and this still needs to be completed. The
union will provide an organisational structure, framework and mechanisms
for the achievement of our objectives. These include not simply abstract or
technical unity, but the political, economic and social integration and
development of the continent and of the African people. Nepad, which was
adopted at the Lusaka summit last year, is the vehicle for the achievement
of our developmental goals.

Underpinning both is the determination that Africa must take charge of its
own destiny. We need to recognise that while the legacy of racism,
colonialism and apartheid remains and has consequences, we cannot become
hostages to the past nor allow it to limit our future. Nor is it sufficient
to set out our objectives. We need to consider urgently how they are to be
achieved - both the mechanisms and the programmes for their achievement.

The principles of the Union include the promotion of democratic principles,
good governance and the promotion of human and people's rights. There is an
acknowledgement that good political and economic governance are necessary
for sustainable development. However, parliaments, which are both the
custodians and agents of good governance, have been notably absent in the
preparations and processes for the Union and Nepad.

Hon members will recall that it was the intervention of the SADC
Parliamentary Forum and its mobilisation of parliaments that resulted in
the OAU heads of state agreeing to allow parliaments in Africa to draft the
protocol for the Pan African Parliament. Regrettably, we have not sustained
and extended that initiative.
This Parliament is fortunate, and it would appear that we are an exception,
in being requested by the executive to be involved, and in receiving co-
operation and relevant documentation as we ask for it.

The working group established by the National Assembly has been giving
considerable thought to the implementation of the Constitutive Act, and
later today I trust that the House will adopt the fourth report of the
working group. This and previous reports provide some indication of how
much has yet to be done.

The protocol of the Pan African Parliament will be tabled this week and the
working group will prioritise consideration for its ratification. We will
also need to consider how we implement the protocol to make the Pan African
Parliament an effective instrument.

But much remains to be done by this Parliament. Our Constitution provides
for oversight and accountability, and after eight years, we are still
developing principles, procedures and capacity to ensure that we are able
to carry out these responsibilities nationally. Now we have additional
challenges. What provision do we make for Parliament to be involved in
agreements that will have to be made within the organs of the African Union
- both in the process of establishing them and as they function thereafter?

The Declaration of the World Conference of Presiding Officers two years ago
argued for the necessary involvement of legislatures in the process of
finalising international agreements, rather than in subsequent
ratification, which in many cases amounts to rubber-stamping.

We need to consider the experience of other parliaments, such as how
European parliaments relate to the European Union, as well as the
procedures and experiences of West Africa and East Africa, where regional
parliaments are either operating or are being established. We may need
ourselves to consider setting up a special committee that will focus on
involvement in multilateral organisations, where agendas of forthcoming
meetings are tabled and discussed, and to which portfolio committees can
bring their expertise. That is merely one of many options. The important
issue is that Parliament must make an input before final decisions are
taken on major issues.

New organs are also being established. The working group will need to make
proposals on these, while ensuring that the expertise that resides in
portfolio committees is incorporated, as these organs deal with very
specialised areas. Then there is a range of draft protocols and procedures
which we should be considering. In particular, we will have to look at the
peer review mechanism and the documents on good political and economic
governance.

Nepad has given extensive consideration to enhancing capacity in
institutions and we should be examining these in particular. Parliament
needs to consider its own capacity to meet the needs of the 21st century
and the African Union. As we are currently organised and resourced, can we
fulfil the responsibilities that involvement in the African Union will
bring, as well as meaningful participation in the Pan-African Parliament?

The working group has commissioned research on comparable experience, and
we will all need to consider these papers and issues and others yet to be
identified and explored. We will also be meeting with representatives from
all African parliaments on 28 and 29 June to share our perspectives and
establish common goals and priorities. This will be the first such occasion
on our continent.

Last but not least, indeed one of the most important issues that need
consideration: How are we as public representatives going to make sure that
the South African public is informed about what is happening? Even more
important, how are we going to involve them in the process of building the
Union? Look at our public gallery. What does it say about how much interest
we have generated amongst the public?

What measures do we take to raise awareness and cement African unity at a
people-to-people level? How are our people going to take ownership of the
Union and its organs? How will they relate to the Pan-African Parliament?
Unity is not about documents which we debate and to which heads of state
attach signatures, nor is it about laws and protocols. These simply provide
a framework.

The enthusiasm of the people has to be mobilised and xenophobia countered.
Unity of the people of this continent has to be infused into our daily
lives and practice, and to inspire our culture. Ultimately, we need to
ensure that people see the evidence of the benefits of unity in their daily
lives. That is the real challenge for Africa in the 21st century, or
documents and paper, as well as our hopes and aspirations, will simply be
blown away by the winds of empty rhetoric and inaction. The time has come,
but it has come for us to act. [Applause.]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Mr Chairperson and hon members, Vukan mawethu, nimanyane?
So goes the song of ages. It says, ``arise you people and unite''. It
encapsulates the African dream of African awakening and building a mighty,
united continent.

African visionaries have articulated and spread the gospel of African
unity. This vision has been expressed in ecclesiastical as well as
political arenas. The founders of Pan-Africanism conceptualised it, shaped
it and developed it into a potent philosophy for the continent. I am
referring here to the luminaries like Marcus Garvey, Sylvester Williams, Du
Bois, Kwame Nkrumah, Sékou Touré, Jomo Kenyatta, Mangaliso Sobukwe, Zeph
Mothopeng, Patrice Lumumba, Nelson Mandela - the list is inexhaustible.

Sylvester Williams was the driving force behind the first Pan-African
Conference in 1900. Kwame Nkrumah visualised and advocated a ``United
States of Africa'', with a Pan-African command. The African Union therefore
represents the reconstruction of African societies on existing foundations,
and an endeavour to recapture our past glory.

The challenges that face us are enormous. Are we indeed equal to the task?
There are a number of things we have to do, as Africans, if we are to
succeed in building a new continent. We must stop the wars which wreak
havoc, destruction, massive dislocation of communities and untold misery.
We must breed a new type of leader who does not tinker with constitutions
in order to remain in power for a lifetime.

The scramble for Africa in the 1880s, which carved up the continent into
colonies and spheres of influence, is only the latest in the long saga of
conquest, disruption and destruction of societies in Africa. Colonialism
and slavery have had tragic consequences for African societies. The orderly
evolution of social, political, economic and cultural institutions was
abruptly curtailed. A new foreign culture, political institutions and value
systems were mechanically imposed from outside.

The African Union, which is on the agenda of the continent, could be the
culmination and the materialisation of the African dream. It should be the
realisation of African restoration. The Egyptian pyramids and the ruins of
Maponguberg and Zimbabwe are living testimonies of ancient African
civilisations which predate the European renaissance. Those civilisations
were destroyed by conquest and plunder. The revival of the African creative
spirit can only occur in an empowering and stimulating environment.
Oppressive and violent regimes do not lend themselves to this dream.

The task of building a liberated, democratic and prosperous Africa requires
that we all undergo a transformation. We have had three decades of
postcolonial African rule. South Africa has only recently joined that
committee of free nations. The bigger challenge which faces the newly
independent African states, and which still poses the biggest problem
today, is the creation of viable economies. We are still burdened by the
legacy of underdevelopment. The structural relationship between the African
economies and the developed North is seriously flawed.

We have to succeed in extricating ourselves from dependency. That entails a
psychological as well as a material transformation of our relations of
production in such a way that people on the ground are economically and
politically empowered.

Education is a prerequisite for wealth creation and equitable distribution
of resources. The transformation process must be all-embracing and deep in
character. A value system that places the interests of society above those
of the individual has to emerge. Corruption is the product of greed which
derives from the extremes of individualism. We must nurture the values of
caring, diligence and moral fortitude. [Applause.]

Ms F HAJAIG: Mr Chairperson, colleagues and comrades, today I wish to
celebrate the women of Africa, from the south to the north. Wathint'
abafazi wathint' imbokodo uzokufa!  [Strike a woman, and you strike a rock
and you will die.] [Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: Uzokufa! [You will die!]

Ms F HAJAIG: If ... you have touched the women, you have struck a rock. You
have dislodged a boulder, you will be stopped.

South African women sang these lyrics while protesting against apartheid
laws in the 1950s. These words are only one reminder of many that the
African women's movement long preceded the international conferences in
Nairobi and Beijing that focused greater attention on women's rights in
Africa and around the world. Bunmi Fatoye-Matory, a Nigerian writer, writes
in a newspaper article titled: ``I am not just an African woman'':


  The popular stereotype of the silent and the voiceless African women
  remains alien to me. The women I grew up with were anything but the
  silent.

In the same vein, after the establishment of the ANC in 1912, the women,
wives and friends of ANC leaders decided that they were no longer satisfied
with making tea, but wanted active participation in the workings of the
ANC. They formed the then Bantu Women's League, which was formed in 1913,
to oppose attempts by municipalities in the then Orange Free State to force
African women to carry passes.

In April 1954, the ANC Women's League joined with other women's
organisations to form the Federation of South African Women. Fedsaw was the
first attempt to establish a broad-based, multiracial women's organisation
to take up women's issues within the context of national political issues.

In 1939, women in Eastern Nigeria demonstrated against colonial taxation.
On 17 April 1954 a Women's Charter was adopted in Johannesburg by the
Federation of South African Women, and women from the Congress of
Democrats, the SA Coloured People's Organisation, the South African Indian
Congress and the Food and Canning Workers Union.

I wish to read these aims, because this actually shows that what was
encompassed in this charter unfortunately remains to be done in the rest of
Africa.

These were the aims of the charter:


  This organisation is formed for the purpose of uniting women in common
  action for the removal of all political, legal, economic and social
  disabilities. We shall strive for women to obtain:


  1.  The right to vote ...

That we have -


       ... and to be elected to all state bodies, without restriction or
       discrimination.


  2.  The right to full opportunities for employment with equal pay and
       possibilities of promotion in all spheres of work.


  3.  Equal rights with men in relation to property, marriage and children,
       and for the removal of all laws and  customs  that  deny  women  such
       equal rights.


  4.  For the development of every child through free compulsory  education
       for all; for the protection of mother  and  child  through  maternity
       homes, welfare clinics, creches and nursery schools,  in  countryside
       and towns; through proper homes for all and through the provision  of
       water, light, transport, sanitation, and other  amenities  of  modern
       civilisation.


  5.  For the removal of all laws that restrict free movement, that prevent
       or hinder the right of free association and  activity  in  democratic
       organisations and the right to  participate  in  the  work  of  these
       organisations.

So the list continues. The last aim  is  ``to  strive  for  permanent  peace
throughout the world''.

The aims of this document were  included  in  the  Freedom  Charter  a  year
later, and in our Constitution and Bill of Rights  in  1996.  Heroines  like
Lilian Ngoyi, Helen  Joseph,  Rahima  Moosa,  Ray  Alexander,  Dora  Tamana,
Hettie September, Frances Baard, Bertha  Gxowa,  Dorothy  Nyembe,  Albertina
Sisulu, Ruth First, Fatima Meer and Gertrude Shope  are  a  few  among  many
others who played a pivotal role in the campaign against passes,  and  later
in the defiance campaign.

Later in 1962, 3 000 women from the Transvaal Indian Congress  led  a  march
to the Union Buildings, protesting against the Group  Areas  Act.  In  other
parts of Africa we saw similar struggles, in Algeria, Nigeria,  Egypt,  Côte
'Ivoire, Congo, Kenya, Namibia, Zimbabwe,  Zambia,  Mozambique  -  the  list
goes on - where women fought  side  by  side  against  the  oppressors.  All
countries except one in Africa are now free and they are all gearing  up  to
launch the African Union, which will drive the implementation of Nepad.

We have come a long way, but women in Africa have still a long way to go  in
order to claim their human rights and their dignity. African women  do  face
great obstacles. Adult female literacy in 1992 was only 45%  in  sub-Saharan
Africa. Maternal mortality rates averaged 606 per 100 000  live  births,  as
compared to  351  for  other  developing  countries.  African  women's  work
accounts for some 80% of food production  but  they  derive  little  benefit
from their governments or international programmes favouring cash crops  for
export.

Women and children are particularly vulnerable victims  of  the  continent's
internal conflicts. By the end of this year 90% of Aids orphans will  be  in
Africa. Levels of domestic violence against women are  very  high  and  even
less reported than in many other parts of the world.  South  Africa  is  the
only country that has enacted legislation to assist in that.

I remember the market women of Nigeria. I often  think  of  how  astute  and
dynamic they are in doing business, and the question I ask is: What a  great
difference would they be able to make  if  given  a  chance  in  the  formal
economy  by  being  given  access  to  credit,  education,  information  and
technology? There is great poverty  on  our  continent  and  the  women  and
children bear the greatest burden.

To bring home the problems children face on our continent,  I  will  read  a
verse called Children  of  Africa,  by  none  other  than  our  Minister  of
Housing, Sankie Mahanyele. It reads:


  I do not have the leisure
  to wander along aimless paths
  to wallow in literary art creations
  I have not been blessed with the time
  to ponder over words of language
  and anoint my aesthetic excitement
  I lack the artistic skill
  to enable a dissection of purpose
  into the now and then of time
  and no expediency of professional competence
  to operate man's emotion and wish
  no surgical skill has a punctilious ability
  to bridge the continuity of full man
  I am a mere soldier-poet
  The poet that be man and soldier
  who runs gun battles between ditchy shrubs
  rocky mountains and swampy valleys
  I live the life of mud and trench
  I cannot shelve my creative instincts
  until peace time until peace time ...
  only run gun battles and kill and kill
  I cannot live like a tree that
  bears one fruit one type
  cause I do not have the leisure ...

I only have three minutes left. I would like to say that  all  the  concerns
that face Africa's women and children have to be part of the agenda  of  the
African Union, if the  implementation  of  Nepad  is  to  be  constructively
realised. I feel that there  is  a  need  for  a  mechanism  or  institution
specifically to ensure that  the  African  Union's  objective  of  promoting
gender equality is actually  realised,  in  both  spirit  and  action.  This
mechanism or institution should  monitor,  evaluate,  review  and  recommend
gender mainstreaming to ensure gender equity in all governance and decision-
making structures and processes.

I would also like  to  see  the  regeneration  of  the  Pan-African  Women's
Organisation  that  can  link  up  concretely  with  women  from   different
countries.

I would like to celebrate the achievements of the women of Africa,  who  are
the sustainers  of  the  fire,  family  and  food  security,  that  is,  the
essentials of life. How can we acclaim the women who were forced into  exile
and the women who stayed behind to continue the struggle here?  How  can  we
acclaim our poets, writers, singers, and mothers of Africa?

In some areas, we are ahead of much of the  world.  Five  African  countries
are among the top 15 in the world in terms of the  percentage  of  women  in
national parliaments, ranking  ahead  of  Canada  and  the  United  Kingdom.
Eleven African countries equal or surpass the  11,7%  in  the  US  House  of
Representatives.

Last but not least, I want to associate myself  with  this  little  poem  by
Minister Mahanyele. It reads:


  It is good for them
  to know who I am
  I am Bambatho on Cetswayo
  related to Nghunghunyana
  cousining Moshoeshoe
  to converge at Isandhwana
  And bivouac at Voortrekkerhoogte
  but the pigmentation hatchet men
  insist I am confused, indeed
  Vendaland by Ciskei is my home
  but I know who I am
  I know and feel my roots.
  My mother sojourned at Ramabulana
  my uncle is Ndebele
  my father is my father
  I am South Africa
  I am Africa

Lastly, I would like to thank Pregs Govender,  a  comrade  and  friend,  for
sterling work done in the quest for justice for women  in  South  Africa.  I
wish her well in all her endeavours. [Applause.]

I have a few minutes left. I want to mention a few outstanding freedom
fighters of Africa. Nana Yaa Asantewa was a Ghanaian who fought with the
Asante against the British in 1900. In Angola, we had a freedom fighter,
Rodrigues was her name. From Mozambique, I would like to mention Josina
Machel. In Egypt, there was a woman called Doria Shafik.

I want to mention, at this point, the Afrikaner women and African women
who, side by side, died in the concentration camps in the Anglo-Boer War.

I would also like to acclaim an environmental activist from Kenya, Wangari
Matqai.

Last but not least, in terms of cultural achievements of women, in Nigeria,
Flora Nwapa was the first Nigerian woman who published a novel on this
continent. I would also like to acclaim Nawal El-Saadawi from Egypt, and
Bessie Head and Nadine Gordimer from South Africa. I would like to acclaim
our singers such as ``Mama Afrika'' Miriam Makeba, Dolly Rathebe and
Sibongile Khumalo, and our poets, Baleka Mbete and Sankie Mahanyele, and
the list can go on and on.

Adv Z L MADASA: Mhlalingaphambili nani mawethu, izinto zinyembelekile.
IAfrika ayikakhululeki ncam nangona ulawulo norhulumente ebonakala
esezandleni zethu. Eli lizwe loobaw' omkhulu aligqibanga nje ngokuba
lixhatshazwe ngamasela nezihange zamazwe aphesheya, zirhwaphiliza ubutyebi
beli, nangoku urhwaphilizo lusaqhuba. Lungaphela njani urhwaphilizo le nto
irhwaphilizwayo ingekapheli? Xa besiqhatha bathi, ``Amaxesha ngamanye. Ama-
Afrika maraguqule iindlela zokuziphatha, ukuba afuna uncedo nenkqubela
phambili''.

Iingxaki zethu, ngokutsho kwabo, bazibeka emagxeni ethu, bafuna ukuthi
thina ngokwethu singunobangela weengxaki zethu. Basibetha ngemf' iphindiwe
xa besitsho. Amaxesha ngamanye ntoni izinto bezonakalisa ngabom nje? Nabaya
beshumayela urhwebo olukhululekileyo batsho bona beluvala, bezikhusela.
Nabaya bekhala ngamalungelo abantu, batsho bona bengawakhathalelanga loo
malungelo. Babekhala ngamaTshayina nje ngaphambili kutheni ngoku bethe
cwaka, berhweba nala MaTshayina nje? Basayina nathi iAGOA, kodwa xa sifuna
ukuyisebenzisa le AGOA bakhale ngemigangatho yethu ephantsi. Bakhala
ngoorhulumente besininzi ze bona baxhase oorhulumente abahlutha ulawulo
ngezigalo. Ezi zikhalazo zabo, ewe zona zeziphathekayo, kodwa masilumkele
ukuqhathwa.

Nathi sizenzela uxanduva, ngobuyatha bezinye iinkosi zethu zeAfrika.
Sinengxaki yeenkokeli ezingoohlohlesakhe nezingabarhwaphilizi. Sikwanayo
nengxaki yeenkokeli ezineenkani nezingafuni kushiya iintambo zolawulo kuba
zisitya. Sinengxaki yabantu abafuna ubutyebi babumini, nobujika buphelele
ezandleni. Siyathengisana, yaye sithengeka lula, kuba indlala iyasiphaxula.
Kwathina sivulela izizwe zisixhaphaze, ngenxa yobuyatha bethu.

Mawethu, into efunekayo ziinkokeli ezintsha ezizimisele ekusebenziseni
iindlela ezintsha zolawulo, nezo zizimisele ekukhonzeni abantu bethu.
Ixesha leAfrika lifikile. Masibumbane, sihloniphane, sincedisane ze
sikhonze abantu ngenyaniso nangokuzimisela. Imbumba yethu maAfrika mayibe
yimbumba eyakhayo yenkqubela, ingabi yimbumba yengcinezelo norhwaphilizo.
Imbumba yama-Afrika mayingabi yimbumba yeenkokeli kuphela koko mayibe
yimbumba yeenkokeli kunye nabantu kubanjiswene.

Xa sithetha ngolawulo olululo, masingacingi kuphela ngokutsala utyalo-
zimali phesheya, koko masazi ukuba ubutyebi beli lizwe lethu bufuneka
ebantwini bethu kuba bahluphekile. I-Afrika mayibuye. Izwe lethu!
(Translation of Xhosa speech follows.)

[Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson and colleagues, things are bad. Africa is not
yet free, although the rule of power seems to be in our hands. Corrupt
people and fraudsters from other countries have exploited the country of
our grandfathers' wealth, and even today, we are battling with corruption.
How can fraud and corruption end when there is still plenty of what
attracts fraudsters and corrupt people? They would often blind us and say,
``Times are different. Africans should change the ways in which they govern
if they want assistance and development''.

Our problems, according to them, rest on our shoulders; they claim that we
create our own problems. They are not being honest when they say that. They
mess things up for us and then say times are different. Hear them preaching
free trade while they are reducing those chances, protecting themselves.
They loudly talk about human rights while they do not care a bit about
human rights. They used to say much about Chinese before but you do not
hear anything from them any more. It is because they entered into trade
agreements with these Chinese. We signed the AGO agreement with them but
when we want to put into practice what we agreed upon, they say that our
standards are low. They preach democracy but they support military
governments. Their complaints are sound but we must be careful they do not
cheat us. Notwithstanding that, we are also creating problems for
ourselves, as some of our African traditional leaders would act stupidly.
We have a problem of leaders that are fat cats and are very corrupt. We
also have a problem of stubborn leaders who do not want to step down from
positions of power. We have a problem of people who want to get rich fast
and yet soon lose all the richness. We are easily corruptible because of
hunger and starvation. We allow other countries to exploit us because of
our foolishness.

My colleagues, we need new leadership that would be committed to using new
governing methods, and a leadership that is committed to serving our
people. The time for Africa has come. Let us unite, respect one another,
help one another and serve the people with honesty and commitment. Our
unity as Africans must be a union that is committed to progress, and not
that of oppression and corruption. The African Union must not be a union
for leaders only but a union of leaders together with people.

When we speak about good governance, we should not only think about foreign
investment, but we should know that the wealth of our country needs to be
distributed among the people, for they are poor. Let Africa, our Land come
back!]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, unluckily I only have three minutes to
speak. I have stated more than once at this podium that I am an African. I
have just returned from a visit to the Netherlands and Belgium, where I
addressed different audiences in Afrikaans. I addressed them about South
Africa and the problems we have in South Africa. In all my speeches I
thanked them for their important contribution to our cultural heritage as
Afrikaners. But I also stated that we were no longer Europeans; we are
Africans.

The future of Afrikaners will not be determined in Belgium or the
Netherlands, or by Afrikaans speakers in Australia, but by Afrikaners in
South Africa. If one studies the colours of the African flags, 44 have the
colour green in them. The FF, on purpose, included green in our party
colours to symbolise our commitment to Africa. Hon members can check that
out.

Vandag se onderwerp sê: Afrika se tyd het gekom. Die vraag is egter wat dit
beteken, spesifiek ook vir Afrikaners. Ek het waardering vir dr Pallo
Jordan se benadering vandag. Ons verskil dikwels, maar ek het waardering
vir sy benadering om Afrika se suksesse, maar ook die mislukkings, eerlik
by die naam te noem. Te dikwels bluf ons onsself deur dan te maak of die
politieke onstabiliteit, die burgeroorloë en die ekonomiese agterstande nie
gebeur nie en dit te ignoreer.

Aan die ander kant, deur ons daarin te verlekker dat Afrika probleme het,
gaan nie een van die probleme enigsins oplos nie. As Afrika se skip sink,
sink ons almal saam. Dit geld vir elkeen in die Huis - ook die Afrikaners
daar buite. Ongelukkig is die boodskap wat Afrikaners dikwels van Afrika
kry, en soos hulle dit ervaar, dat daar nie plek vir die Afrikaanse taal,
sy waardes of sy manier van doen in Afrika is nie - dit uit sommige
uitsprake wat onverantwoordelik gemaak word deur mense daar buite.
Natuurlik lok dit reaksie uit, ook van my. As dit die prys is, dan is dit
te hoog.

Soos Afrika die Arabiere in die noorde aanvaar, sal hulle ook Afrikaners in
die suide aanvaar - alhoewel die kulture dan verskil. Dan leer ons uit die
foute van Afrika en uit die verlede en ons herhaal nie die foute nie.
Gesamentlik kan ons dan die probleme van Afrika oplos.

Vergeet van Europa, vergeet van Amerika. Ek het in Amerika studeer. Ek het
baie male deur Europa getoer. Hulle kan nie Afrika se probleme oplos nie.
Ons sal dit self moet doen, maar dan moet ons eers eerlik met mekaar wees
oor die probleme van Afrika, die konflikte in Afrika, en ons kan dié
konflikte oplos deur ruimte vir mekaar te maak, sodat elkeen homself kan
wees in Afrika. As dit waar is, het die tyd van Afrika gekom en lyk die
toekoms vir ons almal baie mooier. Mag God sy hand oor Afrika hou.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Today's subject reads: Africa, the time has come! However, the question is
what this means, specifically also for Afrikaners. I can appreciate Dr
Pallo Jordan's approach today. We often differ, but I can appreciate his
approach of genuinely naming Afica's successes, but also its failures. All
too often we bluff ourselves by making as if the political instability, the
civil wars and economic backlogs never occurred and ignoring them.

On the other hand, taking pleasure in the fact that Africa does have
problems will in no way solve any of those problems. If Africa's ship
should sink, we will all sink together. That applies to everyone in the
House, the Afrikaners out there as well. Unfortunately the message
Afrikaners often get from Africa, and the way they experience it, is that
there is no room for the Afrikaans language, its values or the way it
operates in Africa - this from some of the remarks that are irresponsibly
made by people out there. Of course this provokes a reaction, from me as
well. If that is the price, then it is too high.

Just as Africa accepts the Arabs in the north, they will also accept
Afrikaners in the South - although the cultures may differ. Then we will
learn from the mistakes of Africa and from the past and we will not repeat
those mistakes. Forget about Europe, forget about America. I studied in
America. I have often travelled through Europe. They cannot solve Africa's
problems. We will have to do that ourselves, but then we will have to be
frank with each other about the problems in Africa, the conflicts in
Africa, and we can solve those conflicts by making room for one another, so
that everybody can be himself in Africa. If this is true, then Africa's
time has come and the future for all of us is looking a lot better. May God
hold his hand over Africa. [Applause.]]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Modulasetulo, bo sele bo sena mahube. [Chairperson, it is
tough.]

There is no doubt that the sleeping giant that is Africa has awakened. The
awakening dates back to the early 60s when African countries came to and
parted ways with colonialists. The pacesetter, however, was none other than
that great and adventurous Mokgaga, the late Rev Mangena Maake Mokone, who
had the heart to put a stop to poor treatment meted out to Africans in the
Methodist Church, and who realised that the time had come for the African
to determine his destiny by walking out of the Methodist Church in order to
establish the Ethiopian Church, together with other never-say-die Africans
such as Dwane, Tantsi and Gabashane.

The torchbearers of Pan-Africanism travelled abroad to meet African
Americans. Together, they agreed to bring the African Methodist Episcopal
Church to the African shores. As early as then, they were awake to the fact
that they deserved not only political liberation but spiritual liberation
as well.

The quest for the self-determination of the African is found in the
generation of Presidents Thabo Mbeki and Olesegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, with
their pursuit of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. This is an
ambitious and unprecedented programme that seeks to ensure that Africa is
not a crucible of abject poverty, starvation, sickness and homelessness.
These are the same ideals that formed the mission of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church which also strives, amongst other things, to feed the
hungry, clothe the naked, house the homeless, provide jobs for the jobless,
administer to the needs of the sick and encourage thrift and economic
advancement.

The time has come that the New Partnership for Africa's Development should
not be the preserve of intellectuals and politicians. Spiritual leaders
should also arise and act. It is fitting and proper that the church
elsewhere is at pains to ensure that, in the spirit of Nepad and all that
goes along with it, the prelates of the church in Africa will be the sons
and daughters of the soil. To this end, in tandem with Nepad, the AME
Church has set 2004 as the deadline for African leadership to be in place
in Africa.

The time has come for all Africa to cease looking across the Atlantic or
the Mediterranean Sea for help. The time has come for Africans of all
persuasions to seek solutions to all their problems in the motherland. Yes,
ke nako [the time has come] to accept that Africa is the cradle of
civilisation, religion and even mathematics. We in the UCDP believe that re
batho [we are people]. We were not created from the crumbs that fell off
the Master's table when He created the human race. Africa has to be self-
reliant and we can be self-reliant.

Bagaetsho, le le mo pelong le nkgakile. Fela ga la nkgaka ka gone ke bua ka
lona. Fa le ka mpha metsi nka le bolela. Nelwang ke pula! [I am stuck, but
if I could be given some water to drink I will tell my story. All the
best!]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, Africa has been a victim of the forces of
darkness and genocide for over 600 years. She continues to be an
imperialist hunting ground. Her wealth is looted left and right, and
Africa's people continue to suffer ruthless economic exploitation and
underdevelopment. Africa's emancipation will not fall from heaven like
manna. Africa's sons and daughters must sweat for Africa's restoration to
her lost power, prosperity and dignity.

Pan-Africanists have long known that Africa's time had come. Today, even
those forces among Africans who were captured ideologically and vilified
Pan-Africanists can no longer slander Pan-Africanism without making
themselves complete political imbeciles. It is clear that they had no
vision for a postcolonial Africa.

Pan-Africanism is emerging as the most reliable and powerful political
philosophy of the 21st century for Africa's survival, security and
restoration. Pan-Africanism includes intellectual, political and economic
co-operation that should lead to the political unity of Africa. Pan-
Africanism is socialistic in content and cannot be associated with the
privatisation of state assets, which makes the rich richer and the poor
poorer, and creates massive unemployment.

Pan-Africanism is persistent in the struggle for the social emancipation of
Africa.

The enemies of Africa and their agents have always been hostile to Pan-
Africanism. That is why Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana was overthrown; why Patrice
Lumumba, Motala Mahommed, Thomas Ankara were assassinated; and why
Mangaliso Sobukwe was poisoned on Robben Island.

Progressive forces of Africa must be vigilant. Although Nepad is the
brainchild of Pan-Africanism, it will not succeed if it shall, like a
slave, depend on G8 countries. The philosophy of slavery, colonialism and
imperialist domination are incompatible with emancipatory democracy. They
do not mix. This dependency will reduce Nepad to the new paternalism for
Africa's destruction.

Africa's people must remain on the road of self-reliance and self-
determination. As Prof Dani Nabudere of Uganda reminds us, and I quote:


  The New Partnership for Africa's Development is the product of the
  continuing search by Africa's people and its leaders to create Pan-
  African structures that lead to social and economic advancement. On the
  other hand, Nepad is an instrument of contestation between Africans
  seeking self-determination in their development efforts and those forces
  that seek continuation of exploitation of the continent's resources upon
  which the accumulation of their wealth depends.

To advance the continent, Africans must embark on a 10-point programme:
Promote peace on the continent; maximise the study of modern science and
technology in all her institutions of learning; stop exporting Africa's raw
materials and importing them back as finished products from Europe and
America; avoid the kind of aid which recolonises Africa; formulate a
foreign investment policy which reconstructs Africa; develop a home-grown
emancipatory democracy; strengthen the Pan-Africanist movement
continentally and worldwide; and delegitimise globalisation as an option to
development in Africa.

The time for Africa has long been proclaimed. It will not come by wishful
thinking. It will come through hard work, sacrifice, suffering and
dedicated service of the African people. Izwe lethu. [Our country.]
[Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, our African brothers and sisters share
South Africans' experience of colonialism. We have to realise that South
Africa is but a component of a much larger entity, Africa.

We are united in our horrific history, our heritage and our soul. We might
have demarcated, independent countries, but the soil that runs from east to
west and from north to south is all African soil.

The South African experience has served as an example of hope and
encouragement for the rest of Africa, and like an elder brother, we are
called on for assistance and guidance.

Although we might share a continent, we each uphold a diverse existence,
and other states often have a devastating effect on the South African
economy and social development, both internally and externally. People may
be puzzled how a neighbour's activity may hinder our existence as a
promising and effective athlete in the global races, but it is like the
house next door that runs a drug trade and harbours gangsters, which
depreciates the value of one's property and decreases one's chances of
selling it. It works very similarly in the large context. However, we
respect the individuality of each country in Africa, and what may be viewed
by the rest of the world as unacceptable may be an accepted norm and
culture instead.

Nevertheless, the MF holds firm to the South African undertaking to achieve
global human rights and dignity for all. The task of social and economic
development goes far beyond our borders to the rest of Africa. These
activities may hold a number of repercussions for us domestically. The MF
realises the African potential affluence and vibrancy that many global
competitors fail to recognise. We feel that the huge African debt
contributes enormously to this negativity. If the debt could be written
off, Africa may activate its full ability to take its true position in the
global world.

South Africa for us and Africa for all! [Applause.]

[Ms S D MOTUBATSE: Mr Chairperson and hon members, today we are celebrating
Africa Day. The theme for this day is: Africa, it is time! However, our
detractors laugh and say: It is time for what, since they are so poor? It
is time for what, when they are suffering from diseases? However, news of
the world indicates that this continent of ours, if we were to liken it to
a woman, is a very attractive woman. She is a woman whose womb is full of
gold, diamonds and all the precious stones. [Applause.] Who would not fall
in love with such a woman? No one! It is for that reason that we were once
persecuted, because of our beauty!

Today, a number of speakers have already alluded to the manner in which we
were persecuted and how our leaders were demonised and accused of all
manner of evil, the intention being to destroy our culture, to destroy our
ancient traditions, so that they may impose upon us their way of life,
which was totally new to us.

It is true that our continent has survived many hardships. Today, we are
still poor. We are still in this mess, because of what was done to us. We
were once captives in our own countries. If we look beyond that, however,
and focus on our beauty, we note that there are a number of good things
that are taking place in our countries. After all, we do say, in Sepedi,
that a person is a person because of other persons. When a person comes
across another person, he or she may not simply ignore that person, as
though he or she were seeing a piece of wood. That is why, when one sees
another person, one says something - a greeting. Among the Zulu or the
Xhosa, one may not walk past another person as though one were walking past
an animal. When walks past, you will hear the Zulu saying: ``Sawubona'' [We
see you.] This indicates that they realise that this is a human being just
like them. These are the good things that are taking place on our
continent.

Today, I would like us to focus on some of the good things that are
happening on our continent. When those who had colonised us come back to
our countries, they find that our ``botho'' (ubuntu) makes it possible for
us to live together, regardless of whether one is Zulu, Sotho, Tswana, etc.
We have been able to share a common border because, for us, what comes
first is ``botho''. Therefore, when the so-called nation states were
created, we did not experience any problems because what comes first is
that one is a human being, ``motho''.

Now, all these things have brought about a number of problems due to the
fact that our neighbouring states have been deprived of the very things
that are essential for nation-building. Therefore, we are grateful to our
leader for realising that the improvement of the quality of life comes
first and that it must happen everywhere.
What is more important is the quality of our lives. That is why everywhere
people are talking about ways and means of developing our nation, because
they have not found anything that is already in place for developing the
nation.

There are those who say: ``No, these people brought about progress, because
we could not even write''. Is this true? That is not what history tells us.
In fact, it tells that there was progress in Africa before the advent of
foreigners. Our colonisers sought to channel the progress in their own way,
at the expense of our way of doing things.

Today, when we look at our continent, Africa, we note that there are
numerous conflicts, in countries such as Rwanda, Burundi and the DRC.
However, when we want to know the real cause of these conflicts, we find
that these conflicts do not benefit the nation. Those who benefit are those
who are still able to suckle from this woman. They take her diamonds and
use them to better their own lives.

Today, when we say:``Africa, it is time'', we  are  saying  that  all  these
things must stop and be confined to history. We need to  start  afresh  and,
as the continent, to improve our lives.

Let me revert to the English language, because we have noted that most of
the things that are taking place do so in a manner that is opposed to what
we want. What is important is that we must ensure that all the
organisations on our continent focus on what is important.]

I am referring here to our regional bodies. We know that on this continent
we have regions, and as South Africans we fall under SADC, but we do have
other regional bodies such as Comesa and Ecowas. I must say that as members
of SADC and as we participate in SADC, we can testify to the progress made
in this regard.

But I think we should advise our counterparts that the discussion should
not be based on economic relations only. We should be able to put political
issues on the table, not just military assistance and economic issues. If
we enrich our debates in this way, our regional bodies will be strong
enough so that when we launch the African Union, we will be able to tackle
real political issues that will advance the progress of this continent.

As a continent, what our leadership has achieved up to now is commendable.
We realised that after the adoption of the United Nations decisions and
human rights instruments, our leadership was able to put these into effect
in the African context. That is why we have the African Human Rights System
and for the womenfolk we have Cedaw, which is, of course, the African
version.

This week the gender and women affairs Ministers of SADC held their annual
meeting in Namibia. Amongst issues discussed was the African Union. African
women are ready to participate and to ensure that all the declarations
signed are realised by their implementation. Secondly, African women are
ready to participate and they see the African Union as presenting an
opportunity for the continent to mainstream gender as well. We know that
the image of African women is very bad. Every time one speaks of an African
woman, people think of someone who is hungry, barefoot, with a baby on the
back. But we know that if we drive this process ourselves, we can clarify
this and this image can change.

We in the ANC have had a chance to listen to other countries' reports. And
I must say that there is hope for this continent, because women are
determined to ensure that all the declarations and conventions signed by
leaders are actually implemented within their respective countries.

With regard to Nepad, women believe that we have a duty to ensure that
there is gender perspective adopted as well. Gender equality and equity
should have indicators and must be mainstreamed in the implementation of
Nepad.

We will continue to support peace initiatives in other parts of the
continent, and as ANC women we want to engage our sisters to ensure that in
all the forums, bodies and technical committees we work together as women.

Ge re boela morago go batho ba segagabo rena, re a tseba gore setšo sa rena

paragraph follows.)

[Going go back to our own people, we know that our tradition, as Africans,
cherishes mutual respect. We also know that, through mutual respect and
understanding, everything will come right. We do not want to see more
conflicts, death, suffering and poverty on our continent. We want to see
development - and we know that we do have the necessary skills. When we say
that it is time, we mean that we do have the ammunition to win this war.
[Applause.]]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, the title of this debate is ``Africa,
the time has come''. This debate is a memorable one because we are part of
Africa, and because Africa is ours.

We are, for the first time, confronted with defining ourselves and our
identity in terms of our own country and in relation to the whole continent
of Africa. As we look back at the history of colonialism and its disastrous
effect, we cannot escape the fact that we have for too long been victims of
foreign domination and foreign developmental programmes.

The World Bank and the IMF's structural adjustment programmes have all
failed, simply because they were all conceived and tuned to benefit foreign
capital and the rich countries of the world. Today we are here to celebrate
our achievements as well as to look ahead to the future and the future of
our children.

As we celebrate, we must leave no stone unturned to unite ourselves,
firstly as South Africans and secondly as people of Africa. Our political
and economic destiny must now be tied to the continent. It is a pity that
up to today, we South Africans have not learnt to celebrate our own
national Day together. Azapo is concerned that even on Independence Day
political parties present here in this House still celebrate this day in
separate party style. This does not augur well for the development of our
national consciousness. This national consciousness must be embodied in our
national days and our symbols, so that when we interact with Africa, we
know who we are.

Azapo takes this opportunity to urge all of us that the next celebration of
our Independence Day must be done in style so that all our children can
learn to be together forever in the country of their birth. Our resolve to
unite the countries of the continent should be preceded by our own unity
and identity, and our own pride as South Africans, and being Africans.
Indeed the time has come, but it has come for us to develop a new
consciousness about ourselves in relation to others in Africa, and to
develop an African consciousness. Indeed the time has come.

Mrs B N SONO: Madam Speaker, hon members, 25 May was Africa Day. We were
celebrating our identity as Africans. As we celebrate belatedly, we should
do some soul-searching in order to improve our performance. In South
Africa, we celebrate the significance of the death of the shackles of
apartheid. As a nation, apartheid should stop haunting our minds and
thoughts as we move forward into the future, because we can never change or
manage the past, but are architects of our own future, which largely
depends on how we harness our resources to manage the present.

However, as we sing our praises here in Parliament, we should spare a
thought for fellow Africans who have little to celebrate, some not by
choice, but by circumstances beyond human control, like famine, floods and
drought, and some by the impositions of despotic leaders, either by word,
deed or actions, as exhibited in Zimbabwe.
Given Africa's climate and resources, we should have no problems feeding
ourselves. Food security should not even be an issue, but sadly, it is.
Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique require food aid. In this lovely
country, South Africa, too, many families go to bed without food.
Uncovering the truth means that sometimes, in the face of heated debates
and cold facts, we must be prepared to truly ask the difficult questions.

Believers in the power of the ancestors are that Africans' ancestors are
angry, and the proof is apparent. In his novel Things Fall Apart, Chinua
Achebe writes about warriors, fighting scribes over institutional control,
learning the ways of cheating. Hon members should read that with Devil on
the Cross. Poisoning the Caller we even offer our friends. Further
reference is made to sons opting to roam in the wild, as opposed to picking
up the hoe, the soil cracking from drought although Africa's offspring
continues to multiply.

In our country crime has soared to unprecedented levels. Women and baby
girls are raped by husbands and fathers. If these are the curses of the
ancestors, Africa needs to ask: What are the transgressions? In the
country, there is an urgent need to take the political leadership entrusted
to us by providence, as we have shown in Burundi and Rwanda.

The promise of jobs was, for many, implicit in the political victory of
1994. Through jobs the living conditions of millions of economically
marginalised people were to be improved, resulting in the alleviation of
poverty and more equitable wealth distribution. It is common knowledge that
this Government has failed to create a suitable climate for job creation by
its inability to contain crime and introduce investment-friendly
legislation. HIV/Aids continues to ravage our communities and requires a
united determined effort to combat it. When we celebrate, we need to
applaud the many efforts being made throughout the continent.

Lastly, I would like to address myself to the first citizen of this
country, the President of the Republic. All the above-mentioned problems
make Nepad crucial. This partnership aimed at reviving Africa and setting
it on the road to sustainable development represents hope for us. But for
Nepad to succeed, it must attract local and foreign investment. For this to
happen, Africa must show respect for human rights and democracy and zero
tolerance for corruption.

During the past two decades, African leaders have produced numerous
continental developmental agendas that promised radical restructuring of
their ailing economies, including investment in agriculture, building
infrastructure and developing human capital. Yet social, political and
economic conditions in most of Africa are desperate and unconducive to
rapid economic development and growth.

Lastly, the case of Nkrumah was most pathetic. He could have been a great
man. He started well. He led the independence movement and, on behalf of
Ghana, became the symbol of emerging Africa. He was overthrown in 1966
while heading for Hanoi, where he intended to find a solution to the
Vietnam war. That was written by a Ghanaian - a cry from a Ghanaian about
the failing system of our Ministers. [Interjections.] Even Julius Nyerere's
ujamaa failed Tanzania. Nepad has to succeed and this Parliament has the
onerous responsibility to nurture, protect and to advance it, for the sake
of African Unity and generations to come. [Interjections.] But, as I said
in my speech on International Women's Day, life is a quest after good. We
need jobs to educate, feed and clothe our children. We need to live in a
crime-free environment.

May we, as we march into the 21st century, always bear in mind that the sun
has risen and shines for both good and wicked, Africa included. [Time
expired.] [Interjections.]

Prof H NGUBANE: Madam Speaker and colleagues, indeed the time has come for
Africa.

Selifikile elakho ithuba Afrika. [Africa, your time has come.]
[Interjections.]

Firstly, I am must thank the Speaker for having set aside a slot for this
subject in today's debate. Right from the start I want to congratulate our
President Mr Mbeki on being given the honour to host the launch of the
African Union in Durban, in July this year ... [Applause.] ... and also on
his new challenging task as the first chairperson of the African Union.

When we say ``Africa, the time has come,'' what comes to mind for me are
the past 30 years or so, after the independence of Africa from colonial
control. I was involved with development issues in Africa during most of
that time, either as a university teacher of development sociology or as a
participant in one or other of the international development agencies. Time
and again great frustration was brought about by the realisation that since
independence from colonial domination most African countries, instead of
becoming meaningfully developed, either were reduced to underdevelopment of
the worst kind or showed very little progress in their development.

Various analysts and academics came to the conclusion that the main causes
of the slow pace of development related to the power relations between
African countries and the international agencies of development, which did
not only hold the purse strings, but often decided on the policies and
priorities of development programmes. Thus it was concluded that
development in Africa could hardly take off as long as the whole scene was
overridden by dependency.

What, then, is exciting about the present development is that, whereas for
the last 30 years South Africa was still struggling under apartheid, at
last South Africa is one of the main actors in charting the continent's
future. This we celebrate. In addition, the new African Union will develop
a more coherent and integrated agenda. What is also giving reason for hope
is that the New Partnership for Africa's Development provides a structure
which will underpin in many ways the African Union's activities.

Since Nepad is a partnership between African leaders and G8 countries,
countries that are committed to putting funds into African upliftment, the
power relations of subordination and therefore dependency that I mentioned
earlier will be avoided. The commitment to partnership also means that
there is a framework of principles based on good governance.

In other words, the African unity will not only have a firm economic base
but also a foundation to which individual African countries will be
accountable.

We anticipate that once the two structures begin to work smoothly, there
will be firm channels between industrialised countries and Africa through
which comprehensive knowledge and transference of skills, which build
capacity in a country, will rapidly flow into Africa. Thus, through Nepad,
the gap in terms of knowledge and skills which currently exists between the
industrialised countries and Africa will be bridged and, as a continent,
Africa will be able to cross the digital divide and participate
meaningfully in the global fraternity.

The initiative taken by President Mbeki and his colleagues in the African
leadership to reverse crass dependence cannot but bear lucrative fruit.

When we celebrate the coming of age of Africa, we are not unaware of the
various problems and difficulties that need to be addressed and redressed.
We are happy, Madam Speaker, that Parliament has organised a working group
on the issues of African union, as well as a series of seminars, which
provide a platform for all of us to express our concerns.

Today we are acknowledging that new structures are being put in place which
will take us forward in much better ways. These initiatives need to be
supported. [Applause.]

Mr D A HANEKOM: Madam Speaker, hon Dullah Omar looks great. I will talk
quickly because we cannot wait for him to come to the podium. He will
explain to us where that attire comes from, I am sure. [Applause.]

When I was very young, white South Africans were officially called
``Europeans'' by a group of white South Africans who were ruling South
Africa at that time. People who were not white were called ``non-
Europeans''. There were benches marked ``Europeans only'' on which I was
allowed to sit and on which black children were not allowed to sit. Some of
the beaches I used to go to when I was a child, were marked for ``Europeans
only''. Black children were not allowed to play on those beaches or to swim
in that sea.

Well, although that group of grey men decided to call us European, very few
of us actually considered ourselves European. Most of us had never been to
Europe and neither had our parents. We were South Africans. That was our
identity and that is what we called ourselves, South Africans, not
Europeans. For black South Africans, of course, it was a profound insult to
be called non-Europeans and it was correctly seen as an extreme form of
racial arrogance.

Although I grew up thinking of myself as a South African, I must say that I
never really thought of myself as an African, and many years later it
remained difficult and confusing. Of course we were born in Africa, and of
course we belong to this continent, but could I comfortably say ``I am an
African''? In truth, it was difficult for most of us to proclaim with pride
that we were Africans.

A few years ago Thabo Mbeki, the then Deputy President of South Africa,
changed this quite dramatically. In his famous address, delivered here in
this House, popularly known as his ``I am an African speech'' he liberated
millions of South Africans from the shackles of a certain kind of
oppression. Thabo Mbeki was the voice of our common ancestry, crying out to
us in their wisdom ... [Applause.] ... giving us the gift of a simple
truth, simunye, we are one.

We come from many places. Some may trace their historical origins to East
Africa, or the mountains of Ethiopia, or a village in India, or Lithuania
or Holland or England. That is who we are and we are all Africans. Our
friend Khoisan D - some may know him as Dennis Bloem ... [Applause.] Some
may just know him for his voice, of course.

Dennis Bloem will tell us with pride that his ancestors were the first
people of Southern Africa. Maybe so, and we share in his pride, but of
course we all know that some of his ancestral graves are in fact in
Holland. His ancestors and Cassie Aucamp's ancestors probably lie side by
side in the Netherlands. [Applause.] But, most importantly, Cassie and
Dennis are both Africans.

But to get back to President Mbeki's theme of ``I am an African'' at the
time he probably did not know just how visionary and scientifically
accurate his statement was. There is strong evidence that we all come from
one common ancestor. That is what geneticists tell us. And that ancestor
probably lived somewhere not far from Pretoria, here in Africa. It is now
called a World Heritage Site, and it is called the cradle of humankind.

Now, that is the exciting truth that is emerging: we are all related.
Koisan D's great-great-grandmother was mine as well. I know that this is
hard to believe, but Thabo Mbeki and Tony Leon are offspring of the same
great-great-great-grandmother. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Tony, of course, is immensely proud of the fact that his distant cousin is
now the President of South Africa. Simunye! We are one! And we are more one
than we ever imagined.
Having shared with hon members my own thrill and excitement at the
discovery that my great-great-grandfather, who came here from Holland, was
simply coming home, back to the place where his original ancestors came
from, the sad family truth is that this was not his reason for migrating to
the southernmost tip of Africa. He came here to make his fortune, to take
land from people who had lived here for centuries. He came to conquer. He
came with a belief that the culture of those who had migrated from Africa
to Europe was superior to the culture and beliefs of those that they had
left behind.

Although his religion taught him that it was wrong to steal and plunder,
and had taught him to love his neighbour as he loved himself, he somehow
managed to persuade himself that God had another plan for Africa; that it
was okay to steal people's land; that it was okay to chain people and sell
them as slaves, as long as one dressed respectably, carried one's Bible and
went to church on Sundays. [Applause.]

This is not just the sad truth about my great-great-grandparents' migration
to Africa; it is the story of what happened to our continent. We really
need to understand the history of colonisation properly, and what it did to
our continent. We also need to understand the process of decolonisation,
how it happened and what it left behind. We need to understand it, so that
we have a better understanding of our present reality in Africa, the
conflicts and the underdevelopment that continue to plague our continent.

I started off talking about Africa as the cradle of humankind, and I could
have moved on to speak of the ancient civilisations, about Africa's
magnificent contribution to human cultural development, about peaceful co-
existence on the plains of Africa, a different paradigm, societies that do
not have flashy cars, but where people care for each other and are less
vulnerable than in Western society.

If achievement is about an improvement in the quality of life, and about
sustainable utilisation of our planet's limited resources, then surely our
San relatives, who have lived intelligently and respectfully with nature
for thousands of years, are great achievers.

Many of us would like to do what Mark Shuttleworth did, and go to the moon
one day. But I am sure Mark would be the first to say that real achievement
for humanity lies in improving the quality of life of all our people. If
one has no food in one's stomach, no technological or cultural achievement
can excite one. All that one would want would be some food.

The next sad truth is that, as we speak, millions of people on our
continent, including in our own country, live in dire poverty and are
constantly hungry. Africa is rich but the people of Africa are poor,
desperately poor. Why is this so? Is it our own mismanagement of our
economies? Is it the result of bad governance? Is it the effect of
inappropriate policies, or is it just the inescapable legacy of colonial
plunder and destruction?

Yes, in fact, all of these things are real and do exist and do exacerbate
the poverty on our continent. It does not help to defend elected people who
are corrupt, who abuse power and whose policies serve the ruling elites.
Our Nepad commitment makes it quite clear that Africa is determined to move
rapidly along the path to democratisation. Corruption and violation of
human rights are not going to be tolerated. But, is that the whole picture?


Are we simply missing out on great opportunities in a friendly and
sympathetic world, opportunities offered by globalisation and the lifting
of trade barriers?

If only it were that simple. The next outrageous truth is that those who
colonised yesterday continue to keep Africa down and to impoverish our
people. Globalisation is a reality but free trade is a pretence. As
President Mbeki said yesterday, colonialism was defeated in Africa and the
last of white minority rule was shaken off in 1994 in our own country. Real
achievement, real victory! The fruit of hard and determined struggle, a
brave struggle! Many lives lost and a sweet victory!

But how sweet and how complete? For as long as our children continue to die
from preventable diseases and for as long as our people are hungry, the
struggle must continue. We must declare war on poverty, and the battles
have to be fought on many fronts.

One important site of struggle is the struggle against the policies of the
West that are keeping our people poor. We have all heard about the recently
announced massive subsidy increase to US farmers. We know about the common
agricultural policy of the European Union and the massive subsidies paid to
the European Union farmers.

We need to understand properly how it is that these subsidies are causing
harm to Africa, and how they are impoverishing rural people throughout our
continent. We need to understand it and we need to fight it.

This is how it works. Many farmers in Europe, in a supposedly market
economy, despite the modern technology at their disposal and despite a
number of advantages, cannot compete with farmers producing the same thing
in Africa.

We have a competitive advantage. We export our agricultural products, and
of course we buy in technology and manufactured goods where they may have a
competitive advantage, and we all benefit. Consumers benefit, African
farmers flourish - the real benefits of free trade. But in reality that is
not the way it works. Instead, the European Union and the US government
spend billions of dollars to pay their uncompetitive farmers to produce.
And in some cases, the way it works is that a farmer gets such a high
price, not by selling the product at a high price, but through the subsidy,
that he squeezes his land to the limit and produces large quantities, far
more than can be consumed in Europe. And so we get huge overproduction in
Europe and no market for the same product that is produced competitively in
Africa.

Market economy! Do not make us laugh. Those surpluses are then exported to
other countries that should be good markets for Africa, at prices that are
artificially low, and African farmers suffer the consequences. They are
often forced out of business, their household incomes gone, and the result
is increased poverty.

And, given the high dependency on agriculture on our continent, which is
not the case in Europe, it means poverty on a large scale. It affects
processed foods as well. Factories close down because they cannot compete
against the subsidy. Hon members should speak to retrenched workers in
Paarl and Montagu. They know what these subsidies do.

It is truly a kind of genocide. Strong words, yes! Mr Bush may not like to
hear it, but the truth is the truth and we should not be afraid to tell it.
President Mbeki said yesterday that we will take up the struggle. Well
done, Comrade President. We are right behind him.

The other fight is against protectionism. Free trade to the former
colonisers means ``you open up your markets to our subsidised products, but
we will find ways of keeping your products out''.

My speaking time is running out. If we do not take on these fights with the
same determination as we did the fight against colonialism, then it will be
very difficult for Nepad to succeed and we will not be able to win the war
against poverty. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Madam Speaker and hon members, I suppose I
should answer Derek's question. This is a Mali outfit. I have been to Mali
a couple of times, as well as to some other parts of our continent.
Recently three South Africans received the highest presidential honour of
Mali for their contribution to making a success of the soccer tournament
which took place in Mali. One was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of our
country, the other one was the Minister of Sport and Recreation, and the
third award can be seen here around my neck. [Applause.]
In Africa, we are living in exciting times. Yes, there are difficulties in
some places; there is great pain and suffering, but there is also change,
determination and vision. There are difficult challenges, yes, but as
Africans, all of us, let us share in the excitement. Let us not worry about
the moaners and groaners. We heard one or two such voices this afternoon
emanating from one party, which continues to live in the past.

Let us be amongst those who participate, no matter in how small a manner,
in reshaping Africa's history to get away from the pain, the suffering, the
hardships and the poverty, and to help to build a new Africa, one where
democracy, peace and the rule of law would prevail; an Africa which
cherishes its people; one which respects life and dignity; one which is
committed to ending human suffering; an Africa which stands on its own
feet, risen from its knees, one which is empowered to use Africa's great
wealth and resources for the benefit of its people and the continent, and
one which continues to contribute to the wellbeing of the peoples of the
world, an Africa whose time has come - Afrika, ke nako!

When we speak of the African Union, who are we talking about? Are we
talking of people north of the Limpopo? Is it just a black thing? We must
say to ourselves that we are not talking about other people. We are talking
about ourselves. On 25 May, we celebrated Africa Day across the continent.
That was our day; it is not a `their' day. The Organisation of African
Unity is our organisation. The African Union will be our African Union.
When I say ``our'', I refer to all the people of Africa, including all the
people of South Africa, irrespective of ethnic origin, race, religion,
culture and language. If Africa is one's motherland, then one is an
African.

Today we stand at the end of the epoch of the OAU, after nearly 40 years of
contribution. We stand on the eve of another epoch, that of the African
Union. We must be aware of our past. We must accept responsibility for the
present, and we must fight to realise the vision of the future. Africa has
come a long way.

The glorious past of 1 000 years ago and more, with civilisations equal to
the best in the world, was destroyed by the slave trade, which many people
do not know lasted for over 400 years, that is, for four centuries. In the
devastation of the slave trade, Africa lost, according to some experts, up
to 20 million men, women, boys and girls. Great dislocations and movements
of peoples followed.

The slave trade was followed by colonial domination. At the Berlin
Conference of 1871, Africa was carved up into spheres of interest or
influence of major European powers - England, France, Italy, Belgium and
Germany. To this day, the imprint of that colonial period remains, and it
is not something that is haunting us. It is the reality. We speak English
in South Africa, German in Namibia, Portuguese in Angola, French in Senegal
and Arabic in North Africa. Arabic, of course, has been with central and
North Africa for many more centuries, and deeply influenced the indigenous
languages of Africans across the continent.

After independence, Africa remained saddled with the legacy of colonialism.
Kwame Nkrumah, one of Africa's great visionaries, spoke of the
postindependence period as one of neocolonialism.

Who does not recall his book Neocolonialism: The Highest Stage of
Imperialism? He championed the cause of African unity. Again, who can
forget his book entitled Africa Must Unite? In 1963 we witnessed the birth
of the Organisation of African Unity, with the adoption of the OAU Charter
in Addis Ababa and the proclamation of 25 May as Africa Day.

The OAU Charter said the founding African governments were desirous that
all African states should unite so that the welfare and wellbeing of their
peoples could be assured. It called upon everyone to promote unity and
solidarity of the African states. The Charter called for freedom, equality,
justice and dignity for all Africans, and said that it was the
responsibility of the nations of Africa to harness the natural and human
resources of the continent for the benefit of the people.

South Africa and its people have much to be thankful for to the OAU. During
the worst years of apartheid it was the OAU, including our neighbouring
states, especially after the liberation of Angola, Zimbabwe and Mozambique,
which championed the struggle against apartheid.

Members will no doubt recall the commitment and absolute dedication of the
OAU to the total emancipation of the African territories which were still
dependent. We South Africans owe a great debt of gratitude to the OAU and
its founders. Leaders such as Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Kwame Nkrumah,
Ahmed Ben Bella, Sékou Touré, Patrice Lumumba, Julius Nyerere, Kenneth
Kaunda, Eduardo Mondlane, Amilcar Cabral and great leaders of our country
such as Albert Luthuli and others.

Today, as we celebrate Africa Day 2002 and herald in the African Union,
which will be born in South Africa in July, we recommit ourselves to the
ideals of the OAU and, in the context of the current world situation, walk
side by side with our brothers and sisters in the rest of Africa, totally
liberated today from colonial domination, to shape our own destiny.

The African Union and Nepad go hand in hand. African unity provides the
framework, both political and constitutional, for establishing the greater
unity which we want to see on the continent. When we look at the AU and the
structures which are created under the AU in the Constitutive Act, then we
should see the process as one of development, because the structures
immediately created will not bring about a ``United States of Africa''
similar to the United States of America. It is not yet a federation, but it
is a political framework which puts us on the road towards the creation of
that kind of ``United States of Africa''. The focus of the AU will be
peace, security, democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law and
good governance.

Then, of course, there is Nepad. Nepad is located as an important
instrument of the AU. Nepad is a project of the AU and is located as an
instrument to end economic dependence and poverty, to promote economic
development and to ensure that Africa is put on the road of social
progress, so as to see to it that we deal with the many problems to which
speakers have referred here this afternoon.

The project of the AU presupposes democratic rule across the continent and
it presupposes the rule of law. As a previous speaker pointed out this
afternoon - I think it was Comrade Pallo Jordan in his opening address -
indeed, over the past decade African states have gone a long way towards
making Africa the home of modern democracy. Many more democracies have been
established on this continent in that decade than in many other parts of
the world.

Nepad has identified five areas: trade and investment; agriculture and
environmental affairs; infrastructure development; energy and mining; and
information, communication and technology. The status report which deals
with these matters indicates that there is a very focused approach in
Nepad. Nepad is not an idle dream. It is not an idle promise based on a
never-never approach. It is focused on the issues that I have just
identified, and it hopes to set for itself appropriate timeframes and
mechanisms to ensure their achievement.

Of course, none of these projects can get off the ground unless there is
adequate financing. Our President has taken the lead, together with other
leaders of the continent, to ensure that, indeed, we fight for adequate
finance in order to enable Africa to unpack Nepad and to see to it that its
programmes are implemented. Only recently, in South Africa, a discussion
was held among many role-players in order to ensure that African unity and
Nepad belong to the whole of South Africa and the continent. In our
country, Nepad is not just a Government thing; it is a South African thing.
It is for Government, business, labour and civil society - it is for
everybody.

In the discussions which have taken place in our country, there has been a
focus on the importance of an efficient infrastructure for sustainability,
and the standardisation of regulations and processes to reduce delays at
borders. Amongst the borders we are looking at are those borders that we
share with SADC countries. As many members know, there are many delays at
these border posts. So, those things have to be addressed. In other words,
the road to African unity is regional integration, and in the different
parts of our continent regional integration is being promoted.

It is important to engage in the study of national standards that possibly
hinder international co-operation and crossborder trade; the development of
methodologies for integrated regional frameworks; the analysis of needs and
priorities within the continent; the development of best practice involving
SMMEs and crossborder business opportunities; and the study of successes
and failures, learning from other experiences such as the European Union
negotiations, so that we can avoid those mistakes which have been made
elsewhere.

Lastly, there is an area which requires special mention, and I think some
of the speakers made reference to it. That is the gender issue. If one
looks back at the Charter of the OAU, one will find that there is no
reference to the role of women, or the need for the emancipation of women
and the role that women could play on the continent under the Charter. In
the Constitutive Act of the African Union, there is some progress. There is
a mention of women and youth but, alas, it is a very small mention. We need
to open that door which is slightly ajar, so as to make sure that women
participate equally in all programmes under the African Union and Nepad.
[Applause.]

So, I would conclude by saying that there is a great challenge facing us
here to ensure that all the people of Africa - men, women, boys and girls,
all of us - benefit from the programmes as they unfold. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
