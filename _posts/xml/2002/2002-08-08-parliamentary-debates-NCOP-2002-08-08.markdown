                                    ____

              PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES
                                    ____

The Council met at 14:06.

The Chairperson took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see 000.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, the provincial  Whips  have
informed me that they have  agreed  that  there  will  not  be  any  motions
proposed by members this afternoon.

                         DEPUTY PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I welcome all  hon  delegates,  both  permanent
and special delegates, to the House. It is, indeed,  pleasing  to  note  the
presence of the constitutional leaders of delegations - the premiers of  the
provinces. They are all welcome.

We are also pleased to welcome Deputy President Zuma in his  annual  contact
in a debate with the National Council of Provinces. I believe  we  are  very
pleased that we are able to have the opportunity to be  visited  by  members
of the executive. I welcome them. It is now my great pleasure to invite  the
Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa, Deputy President Zuma,  to
address the House. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Chair, I do  not  know  whether  I  pressed  the
right button. [Laughter.] Your House is very educated now. [Laughter.]  Even
the Chair has some soul as it is moving.

Madam Chair, hon premiers, hon MECs, hon delegates to the NCOP, all  invited
guests who are with us this afternoon, let me begin by saying  how  honoured
I am to be addressing you, Madam Chair, in your refurbished Chamber.

I have always said that the NCOP is the embodiment of  the  essence  of  co-
operative governance. The reason why I keep stressing this is that  we  must
never lose sight of  the  importance  of  the  NCOP  in  our  constitutional
dispensation. It is  the  only  body  that  brings  together  the  national,
provincial  and  local  spheres  of  government  in  one  Chamber.  It   is,
therefore, the place that can best deal with the concerns of these  spheres,
and that can find ways of dealing with issues that arise among them.

It is also a forum in  which  the  different  spheres  can  learn  the  best
practices from one another and gain from one another's experiences. Where  a
particular province or local government  structure  has  difficulty  with  a
specific area within its competence, the NCOP is  the  forum  in  which  the
matter can be discussed so that it can assume a national character.

Let me commend the NCOP on the important contribution that it has made  with
regard to enhancing the legislation that has been tabled in  this  House.  I
certainly support the view that the NCOP needs to be given  sufficient  time
to deal with legislation adequately.

One area which, I think,  needs  some  attention  is  the  participation  of
organised local government through  the  SA  Local  Government  Association,
Salga. If Salga's input is weak, it means  that  the  municipalities  -  the
metros, towns and districts -  are  unable  to  make  maximum  use  of  this
institution. I would also urge the premiers to  ensure  that  the  provinces
provide the maximum support to local government.

Furthermore, I would like to congratulate you, Madam  Chairperson,  and  all
members on taking Parliament to the people last week when the  NCOP  met  in
Umtata. This was, indeed, something that the country had to notice. It  was,
indeed, a historic moment.

It was also a demonstration of our determination in this  new  era  to  take
public institutions to the communities  we  serve,  to  allow  citizens  the
opportunity to voice their opinions on how we are serving them, and  on  how
we can improve service delivery.  It  touches  a  real  nerve  in  that  the
essence of our democracy, the essence of interaction  with  our  people,  is
when we go to them. That is why I thought  it  was  important  to  underline
this important development. I wish and hope that we are  going  to  keep  it
up. The interaction between parliamentary or public representatives and  the
people in this country is very important.

We are meeting here today during a period when  our  country  has  become  a
stage on which Africa and the rest of the  world  meet  to  discuss  matters
affecting the entire planet. Only last month we had the  singular  privilege
of hosting the last summit of the  Organisation  of  African  Unity  and  of
being the soil on which the umbilical cord of the African Union is stored.

The  launch  of  the  AU  has  prepared  the  ground  for  accelerating  the
regeneration of our continent  through  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development, known as Nepad. This House must have  a  full  grasp  of  Nepad
because as representatives of national, provincial and local  government  we
must market this African Union programme, ensure that our people  understand
it and that it is put into operation.

I am pleased that  the  NCOP  had  a  debate  on  the  ``African  Union  and
Development'' last term and therefore  on  Nepad  itself.  But  I  urge  hon
members to continue their deliberations on  the  matter  so  that  they  can
ensure that we have a concrete plan  for  the  implementation  of  Nepad  at
provincial and local levels.

We believe Africa is now well  poised  to  usher  in  peace  and  stability,
democracy, respect for human rights  and  good  governance  from  Durban  to
Dakar.

The launch of the AU and South Africa's assumption of the Chair  of  the  AU
places a responsibility on all of us to work hard to ensure that this  first
year of the Union is a success. It means that provinces  and  municipalities
need to play their own part in accelerating the African Renaissance. One  of
the ways of doing this is to promote interaction between South Africans  and
their brothers and sisters on the  rest  of  the  continent  by  encouraging
people-to-people contact and cultural exchanges. I would like  to  urge  the
premiers and other delegates to look at how we can make this a  reality.  We
certainly need to change  our  attitude  as  South  Africans  towards  other
Africans on this continent. [Applause.]

While provinces  and  municipalities  eagerly  form  partnerships  with  the
developed world through the programme of twinning, we should, equally,  make
an effort to  form  linkages  and  twinning  arrangements  with  cities  and
provinces on the continent if the  African  Renaissance  and  Nepad  are  to
work. This can play a vital role in furthering the objectives of Nepad.

Colleagues will also note that  the  AU  recommitted  itself  to  the  early
establishment of the Pan-African Parliament and  the  economic,  social  and
cultural council, as envisaged in the Constitutive Act.  This  is  aimed  at
ensuring the involvement of all  African  peoples  and  their  civil-society
organisations in the activities of the union.

As we speak, another major international gathering is to take place  in  our
country, namely the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable  Development,
the WSSD. The Johannesburg Summit will be the largest United  Nations  event
ever held in Africa and the largest  gathering  of  world  leaders  ever  in
South Africa. It is, indeed, a great privilege  for  South  Africa  to  host
this event, and I trust that we will all work hard to ensure its success.

In preparing for the WSSD, South Africa has had to play a  crucial  role  in
mobilising a global consensus. We are pleased to have been able to  draw  on
our historical experience of bridging the gap between  divergent  positions,
as we did when we  were  negotiating  our  own  political  settlement.  This
experience has helped us to assist with the process  of  reaching  agreement
on areas in which countries have been too far apart.  We  are  pleased  that
the various preparatory  committees  have  managed  to  achieve  substantial
consensus at this juncture.

Despite the large degree of consensus, there is  still  an  overall  concern
that when it comes to the  very  critical  issues  currently  affecting  the
world, the developing and the developed world  still  approach  issues  from
different perspectives. The summit is especially important to us because  we
are grappling with the legacy of underdevelopment and with how to  create  a
better life for all. We are also proud of the  fact  that,  since  1994,  we
have developed many solutions to these problems,  although  many  challenges
still remain.

The Rio Summit of 1992 adopted Agenda 21 as the programme  to  achieve  this
objective, but, after 10 years,  progress  has  been  slow.  The  levels  of
poverty and inequality continue to be unacceptable, especially in Africa.

This  summit  is  an  event  in  which  all  spheres  of  governance  should
participate. The Gauteng province and the Johannesburg Metro, as hosts,  are
directly involved in almost every aspect of hosting the  summit.  The  North
West province is sponsoring two major stakeholder  pre-summit  consultations
for youth and women's organisations from around the world. KwaZulu-Natal  is
currently hosting the  pre-summit  environmental  law  conference,  and  the
Western  Cape  the  sustainable  tourism  conference.  This   shows   active
participation on many levels and it must be applauded.

The question many people  are  likely  to  ask  is:  What  does  sustainable
development and the WSSD mean for local communities? Our view is that  while
looking at broader issues, the summit should also focus on tangible  matters
such as access to adequate water and sanitation, safe energy,  health  care,
reversing land degradation,  and  increasing  agricultural  productivity  to
guarantee food security. These are issues that affect people directly.

We have, for instance, received a detailed letter from a Ms Nomvuyo  Bontshi
of Maclear in the Eastern Cape,  outlining  very  specific  problems  around
access to water, infrastructure, and social and health services in her  home
town, which she wants Government to address as a matter of urgency.

Our system of co-operative governance is  designed  to  draw  on  our  local
experiences to inform better planning and delivery. It will  enable  us,  as
public  representatives,  to  work  together  to   address   the   kind   of
infrastructural problems that Ms Bontshi wants us to address  urgently.  She
serves as an example because she was brave enough to take pen and paper  and
write to the Government. She was doing it on behalf of many. Members of  the
NCOP in particular  should  play  a  more  active  role  in  monitoring  and
intervening in such situations, because they cut across  all  three  spheres
of government.

It will also be crucial for public representatives to ensure  that  we  take
the sustainable development debate to  local  communities.  Councillors  and
ward committees are important in this regard.

Local government is the hands and feet of governance as  it  is  closest  to
the communities we serve. Government has sought to  make  this  sphere  more
responsive to the needs of the  people.  This  has  been  done  through  the
establishment of structures for the democratic participation of  communities
in developing and implementing integrated  development  plans.  This  places
local government at the centre of development.

Local  economic  development,  through  the  integrated  development  plans,
requires that national, provincial  and  local  governments  plan  together.
This is further evidence of the  high  priority  which  integrated  and  co-
operative governance enjoys  within  and  among  the  different  spheres  of
government.

A discussion of sustainable development is especially relevant  during  this
month, which is  dedicated  to  women's  emancipation  and  on  the  eve  of
National Women's Day. Women are increasingly occupying more prominent  roles
in South African society, and we salute them  on  their  achievements  which
have come about as a result of the struggles that they have  waged  in  this
country over the years. Women have gone to prison, and have  been  tortured,
banished, killed and dehumanised. They have carried the heaviest  burden  of
the struggle in this country.

There are also millions of women who contribute tremendously,  socially  and
economically, in many different corners of the country, especially in  rural
areas. Let us use National Women's Day also to salute these unsung  heroines
who never make the front pages of newspapers, but who  remain  the  backbone
of many households and communities. [Applause.]

As we mark this day, we also need to look at the challenges facing  us  all.
The scourge of HIV/Aids is one challenge that we should  continue  to  fight
together relentlessly. Women, once again, bear the  brunt  of  this  disease
owing to the still unequal power relations between  men  and  women  in  our
society.

We must also note the challenge facing us with regard to the  stigmatisation
and  other  difficulties  experienced  by  women  with  disabilities.   This
continues despite the protection enshrined in  our  Constitution,  new  laws
and policies. We need to ask ourselves what  can  be  done  to  ensure  that
these laws and policies can be  effectively  implemented,  and  we  need  to
change the attitudes that make it difficult for them to be implemented.

The Office on the Status of Disabled Persons in the Presidency has  launched
a campaign to highlight  the  plight  of  women  with  disabilities  and  to
encourage them to speak out. We urge  hon  members  to  contribute  to  this
campaign in their respective constituencies. Let us work together to  remove
the remaining obstacles of prejudice and stigmatisation. Let us  create  the
space for all South Africans optimally to utilise all the new  and  exciting
opportunities our country has to offer.

I am sure that hon members will agree with me that this year's  Women's  Day
has a special significance for our country.  Sarah  Baartman,  a  symbol  of
oppression, humiliation and violation of  the  human  dignity  of  women  in
particular and of black people in general, will be  laid  to  rest  for  the
first time in Hankey in  the  Eastern  Cape  tomorrow.  The  burial  of  her
remains, 187 years after her tragic death and after being  barbarically  put
on display for most of this period,  is  a  telling  example  of  how  human
rights were brutally and ruthlessly  violated  in  the  so-called  civilised
world.

Her burial will be part of a healing process for all  and  should  encourage
us to recommit ourselves to working towards reconciliation,  national  unity
and togetherness as a nation. May her soul rest in  peace  at  last  in  the
land of her ancestors, free from the  prejudice,  hatred  and  barbarism  to
which she was subjected in Europe. [Applause.]

Once again, let me reiterate how happy I am to have had the  opportunity  of
sharing my thoughts with this House. I look forward to seeing  some  of  the
hon members at the WSSD and I am sure that we will,  as  usual,  succeed  in
ensuring that the guests who attend the  conference  have  a  memorable  and
productive stay in our country. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE FREE STATE (Ms I W  Direko):  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,
Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, our Deputy President, hon premiers,  members
of Parliament and ladies and gentlemen, it is once more  a  pleasure  to  be
back in this House in spite of the metamorphosis it has undergone. For  five
years, 1994 to 1999, this was my home.

The struggle for reconstruction and development continues. This is the  case
not only in provinces where the majority of poor people are, but  throughout
our African continent. As members know, it is not only  poverty  with  which
our people are faced, but HIV and Aids as well. It is in  times  like  these
when all of us, in solidarity with people throughout our  continent,  should
stand behind President Mbeki and other African  leaders  and  actively  show
our support and total commitment with regard  to  their  efforts  concerning
the African Union and the New Partnership for  Africa's  Development.  There
will never be peace in South Africa  until  there  is  peace  on  the  whole
continent of Africa.

I appreciate the opportunity of addressing  this  House  a  day  before  the
national celebration of Women's Day, having been invited by the  Chairperson
of the NCOP. I think women throughout the country approach national  Women's
Day with a mixture of happiness and sadness. We are  happy  because  we  now
live in a  nonracial  and  nonsexist  democracy.  We  can  visibly  see  the
progress which the  Government  and  other  sectors  of  society  have  made
towards the upliftment of women. Of course, they only have Hobson's  choice,
which is no choice at all.

Our daughters and granddaughters grow up inspired by a whole range  of  role
models, other than nurses and teachers who were the order of the day  in  my
time. Whilst we applaud these achievements, I join other women in  reminding
our leadership that this is not enough. We still have a long way to go.

We also applaud the commitment of  the  Government  to  prioritising  social
development issues and to focusing approximately 80%  of  its  resources  on
social issues. It lifts a huge burden from our shoulders as  women  to  know
that the  Government  commits  resources  to  care  for  the  sick  and  the
disabled, provides social grants for - I shall not say  the  aged  -  mature
citizens and ensures that all children of school-going  age  are  at  school
and lead the struggle against the scourge of HIV/Aids, irrespective of  what
is being said about our commitment to making a difference  in  the  area  of
HIV/Aids.

We are sad, however, to  note  that  despite  the  Government's  efforts  to
combat HIV/Aids, the number of orphans is  increasing,  as  well  as  child-
headed households. We have not overcome poverty in a manner  that  we  would
all have wanted to, and our movement towards peace  and  prosperity  on  our
continent is much slower than we expected. We  must,  however  difficult  it
is, keep struggling to succeed in our mission for a better  life,  a  better
country and a continent fit for children. We will succeed. We must succeed.
The Free State provincial government  has  had  numerous  achievements  with
regard to improving the lives of our people. This is primarily owing to  two
important developments. The first is the  stable  government  that  we  have
achieved in the last three years. The level of  commitment  amongst  members
of the  executive  council  and  the  co-operation  between  the  provincial
government and the provincial legislature have played an important  role  in
stabilising governance in the Free State.

As a consequence of such a stable governance environment, we have also  been
very successful in improving our capacity to manage public  funds  allocated
to the province. This includes increasing the amount of revenue due  to  the
provincial government from various sources.

The recent transformation of our procurement  system  in  the  province,  in
which we charged accounting officers with  the  responsibility  of  managing
the procurement process, has contributed to a large degree to  the  speeding
up of service delivery. This arrangement has replaced the boards of old.

As a consequence of the above developments, we have  been  able  to  achieve
the following. We have enhanced the skills of unemployed  women,  the  youth
and people with disabilities. Two nongovernmental  organisations  have  been
funded to the tune of R1 million for skills development.  About  100  people
with disabilities in  areas  around  Bloemfontein  and  Thabo  Mofutsanyana,
formerly known as Qwaqwa, will  benefit.  Seven  protective  workshops  have
been funded to the tune of R663 000 to  provide  employment  to  301  people
with  disabilities.  Approximately   30   income-generating   projects   are
operational, and 50 home-based care groups have  been  funded,  trained  and
provided with stipends benefiting 500 women.

We have introduced programmes targeting vulnerable groups. These  programmes
promote awareness, protection, support and counselling programmes  aimed  at
children who are victims of abuse and neglect, street children and  children
in conflict with the law. In this regard, we have just  opened  a  place  of
safety, and we have  put  in  place  an  integrated  approach,  because  the
judiciary, correctional services, social development, education  and  health
are involved. Children in detention are kept there. Hearings take  place  at
that very place. Counselling and attempts by Nicro to bring about  a  change
in the mindset of our youth take place right at that centre.  For  the  Free
State this is an achievement.
These programmes are also aimed at unemployed women and survivors  of  abuse
and rape, substance  abusers,  the  elderly  and  the  frail,  and  children
affected by and infected with HIV/Aids. Early childhood development  centres
have also been put in place.  This  programme  includes  victim  empowerment
shelters, social work services, the reporting of abuse,  income  generation,
inpatient and outpatient treatment of substance abusers and  community-based
care services for senior  citizens.  Volunteers  for  support  services  for
children and women who are victims of abuse have been trained and utilised.

The partnership  between  the  Departments  of  Social  Development  and  of
Education has established a project for the  packaging  of  learner  support
material and textbooks.  This  poverty  alleviation  programme  has  ensured
employment for 960 unemployed women, youths and  people  with  disabilities.
This project is unique to the Free State province and has  been  operational
for the past three years.

After the 2001 Grade 12 results,  71  schools  were  identified  as  failing
schools after obtaining pass rates  below  40%.  The  provincial  government
developed a holistic intervention strategy to address this problem. Some  of
the identified schools were trapped and could not move out of the  situation
without external support. The Department of Education  has  since  appointed
principals of well-performing high schools to assist these schools.

Twenty full-time and part-time mentors were appointed in the five  districts
of our province for a period of one year.  These  mentors  were  drawn  from
former Model C schools and township schools. They  resumed  duty  on  2  May
2002 after extensive consultation with  stakeholders.  Another  intervention
is the Thintana  Telkom  Project,  which  aims  at  improving  computer  and
technology  literacy.   It   also   targets   learners   from   historically
disadvantaged backgrounds. As a result of these interventions, we  have  set
ourselves the minimum target of a 5% improvement in our Grade 12 results.

A number of initiatives have been taken with regard to  promoting  awareness
and prevention of HIV/Aids, as well as looking after  those  who  have  been
infected with and affected by this disease. We have integrated knowledge  of
HIV/Aids into the curriculum of our schools at all levels. All schools  have
been exposed to advocacy,  training  and  support  materials  regarding  the
disease.

We have  successfully  piloted  a  community  home-based  programme  in  the
Lejweleputswa district,  formerly  known  as  Welkom.  We  have  established
approximately 50 groups that have been funded  to  provide  home-based  care
services. We have funded 14 projects for community-based care  to  the  tune
of R2,2 million. We have established step-down facilities in every  district
of our province.

We have implemented pilot projects in Virginia and Frankfort with regard  to
the prevention of mother-to-child transmission,  or  PMTCT.  These  projects
are running according to schedule. We have recently decided to increase  the
uptake  at  these  research  sites  and  introduce  similar  PMTCT  research
projects in hospitals in Jagersfontein, Botshabelo and  Thabo  Mofutsanyana.
We  have  also  established  a  task  team  that  is  currently  working  on
establishing administrative arrangements for the  management  of  the  PMTCT
roll-out plan, evaluating the readiness of institutions for  implementing  a
PMTCT programme, and building capacity to provide the services required.

In order to promote awareness of HIV/Aids and to enable public  servants  to
manage  this  disease  in  our  various  workplaces,  we  have  trained  200
professionals  and  500  public  servants  on  the  implementation  of   the
workplace guidelines we have developed.

The province has increased its TB ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, Deputy  President,  hon  premiers,  special
delegates and colleagues, the gap between the  happiness  we  have  and  the
happiness we could have represents our lack of  self-realisation.  The  road
we choose or decide to take will determine our future.

This brings me to this question: What role can we as local citizens play  to
make sure that the delivery of services is accelerated? We can  do  that  by
directly or indirectly participating in the Government's programmes.

I am saying this because we are all aware that there are people who want  to
see things happen. Some will wonder when  things  will  happen.  Others  are
surprised when things do happen. Some will  even  question  why  things  are
happening. There are  also  those  who  simply  appreciate  it  when  things
happen. All of the said groups are just useless. The  only  people  who  can
add value to this Government are those who make things happen.

Of the three spheres of government, local government has a critical role  to
play in rebuilding local communities and environments as  the  basis  for  a
democratic, integrated, prosperous and truly nonracial society.

For delivery to be visible we need strong and  effective  local  government.
The Constitution of the Republic mandated local government to,  among  other
things,  provide   democratic   and   accountable   government   for   local
communities,  ensure  the  provision  of  services  to  communities   in   a
sustainable way; promote social and economic  development,  promote  a  safe
and healthy environment and encourage the  involvement  of  communities  and
community organisations in local government matters. Local  government  must
also promote the Bill of Rights, which reflects the  nation's  values  about
human dignity, equality and freedom and uphold the principles  enshrined  in
the Constitution.

Within the framework of  the  Constitution,  Government  has  established  a
basis for a new developmental local-government system,  which  is  committed
to working with citizens,  groups  and  communities  to  create  sustainable
human settlements which provide for a decent quality of life  and  meet  the
social, economic and material needs of communities in a  holistic  way.  One
man once said: "We are a nation at work." I know that we belong to the  last
category I referred to, and we are going to make it. One has to  have  long-
range goals to keep oneself from being frustrated by  short-range  failures.
He who has learned to obey will know how to command.

By advancing the notion of developmental local  government,  the  Government
has put forward a vision of developmental local government which centres  on
working with local communities to find sustainable ways to meet their  needs
and promote the quality of their lives.

There are four characteristics of  developmental  local  government,  namely
exercising municipal powers and functions in a manner which maximises  their
impact on social development and economic  growth,  playing  an  integrating
and co-ordinating role  to  ensure  alignment  between  public  and  private
investment  within  the  municipal  areas,  democratising  development   and
building social capital through providing community  leadership  and  vision
and  seeking  to  empower  marginalised  and  excluded  groups  within   the
community.

These  characteristics  urge  local  government  to   focus   on   realising
developmental outcomes such as the  provision  of  household  infrastructure
and services, the creation of attractive integrated cities, towns and  rural
areas  and  the  promotion  of  local  economic  development  and  community
empowerment and redistribution. Three  approaches  are  provided  which  can
assist municipalities in  becoming  more  developmental,  namely  integrated
development planning and  budgeting,  performance  management,  and  working
together with local citizens and partners. It must be borne in mind that co-
operating government situates  local  government  within  a  system  of  co-
operative governance.

While acknowledging that the system of intergovernmental relations  requires
further elaboration, the section provides a preliminary outline of the  role
and responsibilities of national and provincial governments with respect  to
local government. While the national departments' programmes may  impact  on
local government, we are also mindful that local government is  increasingly
being seen as a point of integration and co-ordination for the  delivery  of
national programmes.

All these shining, good, positive and wonderful ideas  may  not  succeed  if
there is no financial management and control. For the above  to  materialise
or to be realised, all members are advised or urged to  read  the  Municipal
Finance Management Bill, as gazetted  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  on  31
August 2001.

I would not be doing justice to myself if  I  concluded  my  speech  without
touching on the  sensitive  issue  of  traditional  leadership  under  local
government. The only trouble with being in the rat race is that even if  one
wins, one is still a rat. [Laughter.]

Since 1999, the Department of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  has  been
telling traditional leaders that they are busy drafting a White  Paper  that
will outline the role of traditional leaders in local government.  That  was
almost two and a half years ago. By the looks of  things  -  the  time  they
have taken to draft this White Paper - it is abundantly clear  that  we  are
going to get a very thick document. [Laughter.]
Up until now I have resisted joining the choir that says that  there  is  no
political will on the  part  of  the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government to finalise this  issue.  It  appears  that  we  are  pushing  an
elephant. [Laughter.] But we are consoled ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am afraid your time  has  expired  for
sure. [Laughter.] [Applause.] That was in no way a declaration of  interest.
[Laughter.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTH WEST (Mr  P  S  Molefe):  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy
President and  hon  members,  I  should  like  to  congratulate  the  Deputy
President on an informative and inspiring speech which covered  a  range  of
strategic issues that are facing  the  country  and  the  continent  in  the
current period.

My contribution today will reflect what we, as a province, are  contributing
to this unfolding drama that is  reflected  in  the  speech  of  the  Deputy
President. When the  democratic  Government  was  established  in  1994,  it
adopted a socioeconomic development programme which sought  to  improve  the
quality of life of ordinary people. In his state of the nation address  this
year, President Mbeki urged the entire country and  the  continent  to  join
him in the very noble and difficult task of pushing back  the  frontiers  of
poverty.

Now, the adoption  of  the  programme  of  socioeconomic  development  of  a
sustainable nature, as it were, and  this  clarion  call  by  our  President
emphasised the fact that our country was, indeed, firmly  in  the  epoch  of
accelerated service delivery and of the consolidation of nation-building.

During  the  last  three  years  all  spheres  of  government  -   national,
provincial  and  local  -  have  focused  on  an  integrated   approach   to
governance,  on  integrated  sustainable  rural  development  and  on  urban
renewal, all of which are strategic priorities aimed  at  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty.

The focus  of  the  North  West  provincial  government  is  indeed  on  the
eradication of poverty and the restoration of human rights  and  dignity  to
all our people, for we  believe  that  unless  our  communities  which  were
previously disadvantaged, are brought into  the  mainstream  of  development
and take part in economic  development  and  unless  social  programmes  are
implemented in  a  manner  which  touches  the  lives  of  our  people,  and
therefore changes them, the  objectives  of  social  transformation  of  our
society and of development will not occur.

We  have,  therefore,  committed  ourselves  to  further  accelerating   the
implementation of rural development and urban renewal programmes. This  does
not mean that in focusing on urban renewal and rural development we are  now
ignoring a number of major programmes of Government. All that we are  saying
is that we are increasing the focus of the  distribution  of  our  resources
and directing them to those  areas  of  greatest  need  in  a  manner  which
impacts positively on the lives of our people, thereby alleviating  poverty,
creating jobs and ending squalor.

We have thus  far  registered  a  couple  of  successes:  180  000  old  age
pensioners or senior citizens - mature citizens - have been  registered;  40
000 child support grants have also been registered. We have also  introduced
a programme for children under seven years of  age  who  need  support,  and
since the call by the President we have registered 35 000 children.  We  are
currently supporting 118 antipoverty programmes to the tune of R14  million.
We operate 726 paypoint sites in the province and each one  of  those  sites
has welfare committees that  help  the  old  people.  So,  indeed,  we  have
responded to that call through our departments  of  social  security,  arts,
culture and sport.

There  are  1  206  beneficiaries  of  projects  such  as  poultry,   trench
gardening, drip-irrigated vegetables and ecocycles.  The  projects  are  for
household food security and for income generation to our people.

With regard to the Integrated Sustainable Rural  Development  Programme  and
the Urban Renewal Strategy, we have embarked upon a  number  of  activities.
We have produced a basket of anchor projects jointly with  the  province  of
the Northern Cape and the central Government in  a  node  called  Kgalagadi.
The worth of these projects has now increased from R198 million at the  time
of the launch to R274,5 million. Of course, it will increase more  once  our
comrades in the Northern Cape have also identified further funds  that  will
be  allocated  to  that  node.  [Laughter.]  These  projects  include   gold
production,  housing,  construction  of  roads,   water   reticulation   and
electrification.

We are a model of a node, and the reason why we are a model  is  because  we
have  demonstrated  practically  how  co-operative  governance  across   the
spheres operates and also how we would  work  with  traditional  leaders  in
that regard. Very soon we will be announcing another very important  project
which will show that even though we are pushing an elephant, the  work  must
continue. [Laughter.] We will be announcing a partnership with  one  of  the
most successful tribes in our province, the Bafokeng  tribe,  and  with  two
municipalities, Bojanala and Rustenburg.  This  partnership  recognises  the
independence of each authority and, at the same  time,  the  interdependence
of all of them.

We hope to launch this partnership in a high-profile way, and that  it  will
send the message that in the North West  province  we  are  dealing  with  a
different kettle of fish, a  kettle  of  fish   that  understands  that  the
challenges of development are of such  a  nature  that  the  differences  we
might have  in  policy  formulation  deriving  from  major  and  problematic
problems which are complex  in  terms  of  defining  relationships,  powers,
roles, etc, must not impact negatively on the needs and  the  lives  of  the
poor. So we will be doing that. We have a number of urban renewal  projects,
as well, which we are implementing.

With regard to land reform,  we  are  accelerating  the  redistribution  and
restitution of land. We are resolving the problem of Leliesfontein, where  a
farmworker died and had to be  buried  along  the  side  of  the  road.  The
families have now been settled in  that  area.  In  Ramatloma  we  are  also
resettling a community in Botshabelo which was dispossessed of its  land  in
the late 1960s. We have done the same in respect of Mokgopa and Madikwe.

Increasingly, also, we are providing grazing land to  these  communities  to
ensure that there is sustainable development. To  this  extent,  246  km  of
fencing, 119 km of pipeline, 24 reservoirs and 54  troughs  have  been  made
available to assist those communities in their agricultural  activities.  We
are also assisting emerging farmers with entrepreneurial  training  so  that
they, too, can participate in commercial farming.

In respect of housing delivery, in the last five years we  have  built  over
50 000 houses and we have 113 projects  in  existence.  Altogether  124  000
subsidies have been approved amounting to R1,75  billion,  R886  million  of
which has already been spent. Our target is to  deliver  1  500  houses  per
month, and we are pursuing that strategy relentlessly.
I now turn to the issue of Africa. Let me say that we salute  our  President
and the Deputy President for the efforts they have made towards the  renewal
of our continent. In particular, we salute ourselves as a  country  and  the
President on his election  as  the  first  chairperson  of  the  newly  born
African Union. That we have been given this opportunity to play the  midwife
role to this new child is clearly confirmation of  the  important  strategic
role that South Africa is playing in the  affairs  of  the  continent.  This
really concretises this whole motion  of  the  renewal  of  Africa.  We  are
renewing Africa through the birth of our own country.

I believe that  through  our  chairpersonship,  the  reconstruction  of  our
continent will be accelerated and  Nepad  will  be  at  the  centre  of  all
development, that all that the provinces are doing relating  to  sustainable
development, good governance and human resource  development  must  be  seen
within the context of the development and the renewal of our  continent.  We
accept the call the challenge by our Deputy  President  that  the  provinces
and local municipalities participate in this regard. Indeed,  we  celebrated
Africa Day in our province in one of the far-flung rural areas to raise  the
awareness of our people about these challenges.

We  recently  had  a  stakeholders'  workshop   that   involved   provincial
government, municipalities, traditional leaders and civil  society  debating
the challenges posed by Nepad and our  understanding  of  what  the  African
Union means  for  our  continent.  We  will  be  going  on  with  many  more
programmes and activities to raise the awareness of our people. I think  the
next stage for us would  then  be  to  debate  these  questions  within  the
provincial legislature. When we do so, the ordinary people  out  there  will
have a sense of what they mean, and these  questions  will  not  be  removed
from them so that they  can  relate  directly  to  issues  of  international
relations and the renewal of our continent.

As a plan, Nepad was conceived and developed by African leaders. It  commits
African leaders and the rest of the world to placing the  continent  on  the
path  of  sustainable  growth.  Nepad  is  a  comprehensive  and  integrated
programme for  the  socioeconomic  development  of  Africa.  It  states  the
problems facing the continent and maps out  a  plan  of  action  to  resolve
these problems. It is also a translation of the African Renaissance  into  a
policy and programme.

So what we therefore need to do is to continue strengthening the  mechanisms
intended to influence good governance, peace and security on our  continent,
and  ensure  that  there  is  greater  partnership;  deal  with  issues   of
development and ensure that, as provinces, we mobilise  the  masses  of  our
people so that these developments become their own programmes.

With regard to the World Summit on Sustainable Development,  we  are  taking
part as a province, as the  Deputy  President  has  indicated.  We  will  be
hosting three summits and these relate to the youth,  women,  and  food  and
agriculture and will take place in the rural areas of Moruleng, Phokeng  and
Mogwase. We do believe that we will also be using the summit to ensure  that
we benefit economically from the huge number of tourists who will be in  our
country at that time.

We  will  also  be  holding  another  workshop  with  the   United   Nations
Development Programme that is  going  to  try  to  draw  the  linkages,  the
synergy, between the development plan of the North West province and how  it
can be situated within the context of the challenges that the  World  Summit
on Sustainable Development will be dealing with. The focus  will  be  mainly
on issues of poverty and human rights deriving from those matters  that  are
directly linked to our social programmes of health,  water  and  sanitation.
These are some of the issues that we will be dealing with.

I hope that what I have sketched here as issues we are  dealing  with  which
relate to sustainable development, integrated development  and  co-operative
governance, do give hon members here a glimpse through  this  little  window
of the North West's humble efforts towards the renewal of our continent  and
towards advancing the programme of sustainable development.

I wish the NCOP a very pleasant period up to the end of the year, and  I  am
sure that we will continue to make our own contribution to  dynamising  this
period with a view to pushing back the frontiers of poverty. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF  MPUMALANGA  (Mr  N  J  Mahlangu):  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy
President, Deputy  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  it  is  indeed  a  great
privilege and honour for me to participate in this debate in which I  intend
to look briefly at the programme of the African  Union,  namely  Nepad,  and
the possible spin-offs we may get  from  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development.

It is important to note that if the implementation programmes of  Nepad  and
of the WSSD are dissected and made to  apply  to  the  ordinary  life  of  a
person in a province or in a village, they will go a long way in a  province
such as Mpumalanga in changing the lives of many  people  living  in  abject
poverty in rural areas.

The  challenge  therefore   involves   designing   sustainable   development
programmes that prioritise improving the lives  of  the  people,  especially
those of  the  poor,  in  order  to  increase  their  access  to  productive
resources, public services and  institutions,  in  particular  land,  water,
employment opportunities, credit, education and health, among other things.

In order to sketch briefly some of the achievements we have  made,  I  would
like to say that we knew when we started, as we know now, that the  road  we
have chosen must lead us to a destiny in which the majority  of  our  people
enjoy a better life,  a  life  in  which  they  have  affordable  houses  in
communities where there are clinics and hospitals that provide good  quality
care for all, and in communities where there is improved education  for  all
our children in well-maintained and well-equipped schools.

While on the subject of education, I would like to mention that  members  of
our executive council, as part of our outreach programme, visit  our  school
assemblies in the morning, on a fortnightly basis, in order to  encourage  a
culture of learning and teaching, and also to help inculcate  discipline  in
our schools. We believe that, as a result, an  improvement  in  our  results
will come into existence.

We want to create a  life  in  which  there  is  a  clear  movement  towards
creating jobs for all  and  in  which  there  are  better  roads  and  good,
efficient public transport. We do  not  need  to  remind  anybody  that  our
province is about 60% rural. I must say that we  have  started  to  make  an
impact on the supply of facilities such as water, electricity,  housing  and
better roads in our rural areas. The backlog is still  very  big.  We  still
need more money to improve the conditions of our  roads.  However,  we  have
gone a long way in changing the lives of our people in the province.
Many hectares of land have been handed back to the original  owners  through
the redistribution programme of  the  department  of  agriculture  and  land
affairs in our province, and we  are  very  grateful  for  this  achievement
which was enabled by the national Department of Land Affairs.

Last year alone we  were  able,  in  the  education  sector,  to  build  386
classrooms. We were also able to renew  last  year  the  twinning  agreement
with the province of  Maputo  in  Mozambique  in  terms  of  which  the  two
provinces seek to enhance the economic potential of the  Maputo  Development
Corridor which runs through our province.

We still have the challenge of spurring investors into taking  advantage  of
these developments. The construction phase was faster,  but  the  attraction
of new investors is taking place at a comparatively  slower  rate.  However,
we believe that the introduction of Nepad, as a programme of action for  the
AU on the continent, and the WSSD, which is on its way, should bring us,  as
the province of Mpumalanga, opportunities which we can take advantage of.

We believe that a well-planned strategy for  our  province,  emanating  from
the discussions which will take place at the WSSD conference, will  help  us
attract more investors than those which we currently have. We are  therefore
ready and determined to take full advantage of this occasion.

At our strategic planning session of the executive council lekgotla  earlier
this year, we resolved that every department should  come  up  with  a  year
plan capturing programmes, specific financial implications  and  timeframes.
Each department indicated what progress it would embark upon  and  how  much
money would be spent on these programmes per quarter.

Departments were also required to report  progress  on  a  quarterly  basis.
Where the work has not been done, they are required to account  for  failing
to perform in accordance with their plans. Further,  they  are  expected  to
indicate what plans they have for remedying the  work  which  has  not  been
done.

We believe this mechanism will  ensure  that  money  set  aside  for  social
development and other matters will be utilised maximally.  I  can  therefore
confirm for this House that on the  strength  of  these  quarterly  meetings
with departments which we have already had, we are on course  in  Mpumalanga
to achieve what we set out to achieve by the end of the financial year.

We have also revived buildings and infrastructure damaged during  the  fight
against apartheid before 1994. We  think  this  is  important  in  order  to
revive the economy of the province. The buildings and infrastructure  belong
to our parastatals and include  shopping  complexes,  individual  businesses
and agricultural infrastructure.

We have also decided to train the entrepreneurs who are using or who  intend
to use these facilities, because we have noted that some of  the  businesses
could not perform well because of a lack of  knowledge  and  skills.  I  may
mention that we have trained more than  1 332  people  in  the  period  from
December  2001  to  June  of  this  year  in  various  sectors  of  economic
development. We hope this will improve the skills of our people.

We are now at a point at which our parastatals are  busy  considering  loans
for these trained entrepreneurs who are  to  trade  in  the  newly  revamped
infrastructure.  We,  again,  believe  this  will  go  a  long  way  towards
improving the lives of the people of our province.
We have also encouraged business, labour and interested  people  in  various
municipal areas of our province to organise themselves into economic  forums
so  that  they  can  start  looking  at  available  natural  resources   and
opportunities in their various municipal areas and come  up  with  plans  in
order to give us an account of their needs. We can then look  at  what  else
we can do, as government, to help them.

Our parastatals are available to advise these people in these  forums  on  a
continual basis. This, we feel, will help in general to improve the  economy
of the province much faster than  would  have  been  the  case  before  this
initiative came about.

As the Mpumalanga government, we are pushing back the frontiers  of  poverty
and we are doing so in partnership with many people in our society  who  are
ready to lend a helping hand. We are proud that we are  making  progress  in
increasing the number of people  who  are  active  beneficiaries  of  social
grants and child support grants. The number of pupils  benefiting  from  the
integrated  nutrition  school   feeding   programme   is   also   increasing
tremendously.
Improving the quality of public education is  high  on  the  agenda  of  our
government. That is why  every  two  weeks  during  our  executive  outreach
programme, members of  the  executive  visit  schools,  as  I  have  already
indicated. We have also improved our financial management system in  such  a
way that we can close our books in time for the end of the  financial  year.
No department was in mora this case.

We have also increased the collection of our own revenue by 42%  during  the
last year. We have succeeded in building more  than  1 115  classrooms  from
1999 to date. We have increased access to  scholar  transport  in  the  farm
areas to more than 11 300  scholars.  Only  a  few,  if  any,  still  remain
without transport.

During the first quarter of  this  year  we  managed  to  supply  water  and
electricity to about 589 schools. We have also succeeded in building  42 000
housing units since 1999. In the first quarter of the  2002  financial  year
alone, we built 3 745 houses in various housing schemes.

In ensuring that our people have access  to  primary  health  care,  we  are
currently building four community health centres and three  new  clinics.  A
new hospital with a capacity of 140  beds  is  under  construction  at  Piet
Retief.

We will not rest until we have done enough  to  uproot  criminals  from  our
society. We would like our streets and villages to be safe. We are  focusing
our energy on crime prevention strategies, particularly to prevent  domestic
violence and the rape of children  and  infants.  For  example,  the  multi-
agency mechanism structures have developed strategic plans which will  guide
the implementation of crime prevention strategies throughout the province.

We remain committed to working together with the private  sector  to  ensure
that economic growth and development remain at the forefront of our  efforts
to create sustainable jobs, which will eventually  improve  the  quality  of
life of our people. In this regard, the  major  provincial  parastatals  pay
fortnightly visits to the municipalities to make sure that  their  knowledge
is implanted in ordinary people.  Also,  through  our  investment  promotion
wing, the Mpumalanga Investment  Initiative,  we  endeavour  continually  to
attract both domestic and foreign investment.

Now, regarding our future plans, the programme we  are  pursuing  this  year
builds on the foundations that we have already laid in previous years.  This
year we are spending more  than  R1,7  billion  on  social  security,  R46,8
million on the provision of social  welfare  and  R58,5  million  on  social
assistance. During the current financial year, we have planned the  delivery
of service in the province  in  such  a  way  that  we  utilise  every  cent
available to us for delivery of service to the community so that by the  end
of the financial year we do not have any roll-overs.

An  amount  of  R114  million  will  be  spent  on   school   infrastructure
development. We are erecting  401  classrooms,  28  special  classrooms,  12
administration blocks, 165  ablution  blocks,  and  we  are  renovating  101
schools during this financial  year.  Not  only  that,  an  amount  of  R136
million has been set aside for pupil support  material  at  ordinary  public
schools.

We have planned the building of a  total  number  of  14 071  housing  units
which will be built during the course of this year. In order to  efficiently
provide and adequately maintain the road network,  we  hope  to  spend  more
than R317,2 million in the province, and about R49 million will be spent  on
municipal infrastructure.

As the Mpumalanga government we will ensure that within the context  of  our
programmes for  integrated  and  sustainable  rural  development  and  urban
renewal,  we  prioritise  measures  to  ensure  the  proper  utilisation  of
resources aimed at poverty alleviation. I must say that we have come a  long
way with this project of poverty alleviation throughout  our  three  regions
in the province. Particularly in the rural areas, emphasis  will  be  placed
on ensuring food security and community-based job creation  projects  so  as
to  directly  address  the  state  of  poverty  and  unemployment   in   our
communities.

The success we have achieved together bears testimony to the fact that  when
acting together we can and shall continue to  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty and expand access to a better life for all.

Regarding the issue of traditional leaders, I want to  join  the  chorus  in
saying that although this is said to be an elephant, we have good  relations
with our traditional leaders. Although they do not formally  participate  in
municipalities, there is a way of interacting, and we are hopeful  that  co-
operation will continue despite other problems which may still  have  to  be
addressed. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF GAUTENG (Mr M S Shilowa): Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson  of
the NCOP, the Deputy President of the Republic,  hon  members,  in  about  a
week's time our country will be receiving visitors from all over  the  world
who will be participating in the World Summit on Sustainable Development.

The people of Gauteng, in particular those residing in Johannesburg and  its
surrounds are all waiting with warm hands  to  welcome  the  guests  to  our
beautiful country. We are more than ready to receive the more  than  60  000
expected participants.

We take immense pride in the fact that our  country  and  province  will  be
hosting this event that has such critical implications  for  the  future  of
humanity and the earth. Staging  the  summit  in  Gauteng  has  created  the
possibility for us to engage in constructive debates on what  all  of  us  -
Government, business, workers, NGOs and communities - need to do  to  ensure
sustainable development.
Our approach is based on the conviction that central to  the  discussion  on
sustainable development are the key questions of poverty eradication,  human
rights, environmental justice, equitable distribution of  resources,  global
peace and fair trade.

We call on the developed countries in particular and governments in  general
to join the developing world in adopting a 10-year programme  of  action  on
sustainable development, with  a  clear  allocation  of  resources  and  the
implementation timeframes. We believe strongly that sustainable  development
and environmental management are important issues for the province  because,
while it is the rich and wealthy who produce the most waste and consume  the
most resources, in particular water and  energy,  it  is  unfortunately  the
poor who live close to the waste dumps, who live  in  areas  close  to  mine
dumps, and who are forced to drink unhealthy water.

The  province's  sanitation  programme,  which  seeks  to  ensure  that  all
citizens in Gauteng have water and sanitation over the next four  years,  is
part of our contribution to sustainable development. Its success  hinges  on
the pooling of resources by all  spheres  of  government,  especially  local
government,  whose  resources  will  be  key  to  the  maintenance  of   the
infrastracture.

We know that there will be various organisations who will use  the  presence
of world leaders to hold protest actions to highlight their protests and  to
protest against world leaders. We have no  problem  with  peaceful  protest.
This is something we fought for and it is included in our Constitution.

What we deplore is lawlessness in the name of peaceful protest. We  call  on
all organisations who are  planning  protest  action  to  commit  themselves
publicly to ensuring that there will be  no  vandalism  and  looting  during
their protest action. We call on  the  police  to  ensure  that  appropriate
steps are taken, using methods in line with those of  countries  that  value
human rights, to ensure that those who break the  law  are  apprehended  and
dealt with accordingly.

In order to respond to the continued challenges of poverty and  unemployment
in Gauteng, we have developed an integrated provincial strategy for  poverty
alleviation, economic growth and job creation.  The  strategy  is  based  on
recognising that while high levels of economic growth, including  attracting
investors to the province, will result in sustainable  employment  for  many
of our people, we also have to deal with the here and  the  now  of  poverty
and underdevelopment.

We believe that a  critical  element  of  addressing  poverty  is  providing
effective  services  to  all  our  people,  with  the  focus  on  the   most
disadvantaged. This includes programmes to  provide  free  basic  water  and
sanitation, ensuring access to electricity, dealing with issues  of  disease
and  malnutrition,  providing  quality  education  to   our   children   and
supporting  early  childhood  development.  We  have  also  made  a   solemn
undertaking to ensure that no beneficiaries who qualify  for  social  grants
and child support grants are turned back simply because  we  have  exhausted
our allocation.

Added to this, therefore, is the need to  find  concrete  ways  of  creating
jobs and income opportunities for the  most  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable.
Many  unemployed  people  in  Gauteng  continue  to  benefit  from   poverty
alleviation projects, such as food  gardens,  and  gain  employment  through
opportunities in the  development  of  infrastructure  on  a  short-term  to
medium-term basis.

We have made significant strides in maximising the number  of  jobs  created
through our infrastructural development projects. Key  initiatives  in  this
regard include the Community-based Public Works programme, the  maximisation
of labour content of Capex projects, labour-intensive  construction  in  the
construction of housing, and the Zivuseni programme to  maintain  provincial
assets.

The Community-based Public Works programme has repositioned itself  to  seek
joint funding between the Department  of  Public  Works  and  other  public-
sector and private-sector organisations, while the  maximisation  of  labour
content  of  Capex  projects  prescribe  that   construction   methods   for
infrastructure development must  have  a  minimum  labour  content  of  60%.
However, for the strategy to succeed, it will rely on what other spheres  of
government are doing to maximise the use  of  labour  in  the  provision  of
infrastructure and in Capex programmes in Gauteng.

Earlier this year the provincial  government  launched  a  programme  called
Zivuseni, aimed at the renewal of our communities and the  creation  of  the
short-term jobs. The aim of the programme is to engage  in  the  maintenance
and upgrading of  provincial  social  assets  such  as  schools,  hospitals,
clinics, libraries, welfare paypoints, multipurpose  community  centres  and
sports facilities using unemployed people on short-term contracts.

Approximately 100  000  unemployed  people  over  a  five-year  period  will
benefit from this programme. This programme will also serve to  impart  both
functional skills and life-skills to enable people  to  escape  the  poverty
trap  by  using  skills  gained  during  the  project  to  pursue  long-term
opportunities elsewhere. In this way, Zivuseni will  reduce  the  number  of
people living in poverty, while Government  continues  with  other  projects
aimed at accelerating  economic  growth,  development  and  sustainable  job
creation.

Our approach is to ensure that as many unemployed  people  as  possible  are
involved in gainful and constructive work.  This  will  enable  our  welfare
system to target more effectively those in need -  the  aged,  the  disabled
and children. Once again, the success of  this  programme  will  be  limited
unless other spheres of  government  that  do  work  in  Gauteng  on  social
infrastructure are linked to the Zivuseni project.

Last year we reported on challenges posed by cross-border municipalities  in
our province. Together with our colleagues in Mpumalanga and the North  West
province, we  continue  to  develop  strategies  to  ensure  that  effective
service delivery is not compromised in  these  areas.  Together  with  these
provinces, we will continue to engage municipalities to ensure that  budgets
and  IDPs  of  municipalities  reflect  the  challenges   faced   by   local
communities and the provinces.

Over the next three  years,  we  will  assist  municipalities  to  implement
effective billing systems, revenue collection, debt management,  integration
of  systems,  financial  viability  and  sound  procurement  and   tendering
processes through the Municipal Institutional Support Centre established  in
our province, otherwise known as Misc.

The strengthening of local government should  also  be  located  within  the
need continually to review the  powers  and  functions  of  all  spheres  of
government. As indicated before, we need to identify  powers  and  functions
that currently reside at national and  provincial  government  levels  which
may be better performed by local government  and  which  could  be  devolved
from the national to the provincial sphere.

While we are still grappling with the issue of the powers and functions,  we
should also be looking at ways of strengthening co-operative governance.  In
Gauteng the implementation  of  the  Alexandra  Urban  Renewal  Project  has
opened up  the  possibility  for  closer  co-operation  by  all  spheres  of
government on integrated planning and service delivery.

However, the current funding arrangement for the project, in which  national
departments  decide  when  to   release   the   funds,   could   delay   the
implementation process. We need to seriously consider releasing the  project
funds in bulk to the province, which is responsible  for  the  co-ordination
of the implementation process, to prevent potential delays.

Nginethemba  ukuthi  uMsholozi  uma  esebuyela  emuva,  esehleli  nomkhandlu
kaHulumeni,  uzosho  ukuthi   sifuna   amaphrojekthi   wonke   ezifundazweni
aqhubekele  phambili.  Kodwa-ke  akufanele   ukuthi   sihambe   singqongqoza
eminyango zonke izinsuku. Akubekwe imali phambili,  amaphrojekthi  uzowabona
azoqhubeka. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[I believe that when Msholozi goes back to discuss things with the  Cabinet,
he will mention that we want projects to progress in all the provinces.  But
we should not be going from door to door every day. Let there be money,  and
all projects will continue.]

The PREMIER OF THE WESTERN CAPE (Mr  M  C  J  van  Schalkwyk):  Chairperson,
sustainable development is dependent on  a  vital  prerequisite:  finding  a
political model which binds our country together and encourages and  enables
us all to pull in the same direction.  These  are  the  twin  challenges  of
sustainable development in South  Africa:  dealing  with  the  pitfalls  and
potential benefits of globalisation, whilst at the same time  advancing  the
project of nation-building in our country.

We believe that the Western Cape is particularly  well  positioned  to  deal
with these challenges and our goal of building a truly world-class  province
is underwritten by our view that the Western Cape is  an  important  testing
ground for the new South Africa. Of course we regard our  relationship  with
national Government as vital in this partnership, but  we  also  regard  our
relations with the governments of other provinces in South Africa as key  in
making a positive difference in the lives of all the people of our  country.
This is the basis of the agreement between the New NP and  the  ANC.  It  is
about the importance of taking co-ownership  of  and  co-responsibility  for
South Africa and our challenges.

For this reason the Western Cape is not an  island.  We  are  determined  to
contribute to the whole of South Africa by breaking new ground  and  finding
solutions, which can also be to the benefit of all in the country.  This  is
the difference between being a builder or a breaker in  South  Africa.  This
is the difference between people and parties who are proudly  South  African
and those who are just partly South African.

In this regard there are three specific challenges which face  South  Africa
that have the potential to derail our best  efforts  and  intentions.  These
issues are  the  HIV/Aids  pandemic,  the  challenge  of  land  reform,  and
ensuring that nation-building is grounded on firm foundations.

I  am  addressing  the  hon  Deputy  President  both  in  his  capacity   as
Chairperson of the National Aids Council and as the Deputy President of  our
country. The Cabinet's statement on HIV/Aids that was issued on 17 April  of
this year was a message of hope. It marked, for many people, a  real  change
in the attitude and position of the national Government towards the  use  of
antiretroviral treatments, as well as the removal  of  the  Government  from
the ongoing energy-sapping debate.

I am convinced that the Western Cape government,  the  national  Government,
and, as a matter of fact, all the other  provincial  governments,  can  work
together extremely effectively to fight the battle against  HIV/Aids.  There
are enough people in all these institutions who understand what needs to  be
done. It is unnecessary to allow this issue to develop in a  confrontational
manner, or for us to take two steps backwards every time we  take  one  step
forwards. To win this battle we must all pull in the same direction.

Lately, however, there has  been  a  worrying  perception  which  has  grown
around statements attributed to the  national  Minister  of  Health  on  the
toxicity of antiretroviral drugs, actions with regard to  funding  from  the
Global Fund and, most recently, disturbing reports about the stance  of  the
SA Medicines Control Council towards the registration of  nevirapine.  These
perceptions  have  done  much  to  undermine  the  power  of  the  April  17
statement. They continue to cloud the real issues in combating the  disease.
We must not lose the momentum which has been built up in fighting  HIV/Aids.


It would be  of  great  value  if  the  national  Cabinet  were  firmly  and
unambiguously to address these perceptions by reaffirming the commitment  of
Government to the principles set out in the April 17 statement.

The position of the Western Cape government is clear. We  cannot  afford  to
compromise on  the  issue  of  Aids,  either  morally  nor  financially.  At
present, it is estimated that between 100 000 and  150  000  people  in  our
province are infected. By the year 2010 this figure  is  expected  to  reach
almost 400 000 if we  do  not  act  immediately.  In  the  Western  Cape  an
estimated 30 000 children will be born with HIV  over  the  next  10  years,
unless we intervene decisively.

The implications are staggering, particularly in the  light  of  sustainable
development. There will be an increased demand of one million  new  hospital
bed days, a 100% increase in the number of orphans and a  500%  increase  in
the demand for child dependency grants. This is why we cannot afford not  to
make dramatic  health  interventions,  particularly  in  the  prevention  of
mother-to-child transmission. This is the case in all provinces and  in  all
parts of our country. We estimate that with  our  prevention  of  mother-to-
child transmission programme,  we  will  be  able  to  keep  the  levels  of
infection in the Western Cape below 10% in 2010, and this  is  what  we  are
aiming to do.

However, the moral and financial responsibility to fight Aids  is  not  only
ours  as  Government.  It  also   rests   with   the   major   international
pharmaceutical companies. The scale of the human disaster is so  great  that
these companies must consider voluntarily waiving certain  of  their  patent
rights to allow for cheaper local licensing and generic local production  of
life-saving antiretroviral drugs. Similarly,  one  of  the  first  steps  in
winning the fight against HIV/Aids is increasing access to and reducing  the
cost of Aids testing. I would like to ask the hon the  Deputy  President  to
reaffirm the commitment of the  national  Government  as  expressed  in  the
statement of 17 April.

Another issue which has received less public attention  than  HIV/Aids,  but
which  has  a  similarly  explosive  potential  to   undermine   sustainable
development in our country, is the question of land and  land  reform.  This
is an issue tied closely to poverty in our country.  Poverty  forces  people
to make use of any available means  to  provide  for  themselves  and  their
families - most often at the expense of the environment  and  a  sustainable
future. If we are really committed to the principle of  poverty  relief  and
sustainable development, it is vital for us to address  the  issue  of  land
reform.

In Suid-Afrika bestaan, in alle regeringsfere, 'n sterk politieke wil om  'n
proses van ordelike, maar dringende, grondhervorming  te  bevorder.  Dit  is
dié vennootskap tussen die nasionale,  provinsiale  en  plaaslike  regerings
waarin die sleutel tot sukses lê. Die probleem in Suid-Afrika lê daarin  dat
dié politieke wil in daadwerklike optrede omgesit moet word. Die  proses  is
té stadig, en is ook nie innoverend genoeg nie. Ons  sal  die  probleem  nie
oplos bloot deur grond uit te deel nie.

Grondhervorming vereis ten minste drie ander  lewensbelangrike  elemente  om
volhoubaar te wees. Die grond  moet  kommersieel  lewensvatbaar  wees,  daar
moet toegang wees  tot  finansiering,  en  die  kennis  en  vaardighede  van
opkomende boere moet ontwikkel en uitgebrei word. (Translation of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[In South  Africa,  in  every  sphere  of  government,  there  is  a  strong
political will to promote a process of orderly, yet urgent land  reform.  It
is this partnership between the national, provincial and  local  governments
that holds the key to success. The problem in  South  Africa  is  that  this
political will should be changed into real action. The process is  too  slow
and not innovative enough. We will not solve the problem by  merely  handing
out land.

Land reform requires at least three other vital elements to be  sustainable.
The land should be commercially viable, there has to be access to  financing
and the expertise of emerging farmers has to be developed and expanded.]

It is now our plan, over the next few years, to add another  7  000  farmers
from previously disadvantaged communities to  the  11  000  farmers  in  the
Western Cape in an exciting partnership  with  the  national  Department  of
Agriculture and Land Affairs.
A key element in ensuring that nation-building in our  country  is  grounded
on firm foundations is to find a sustainable, mutual  accommodation  of  the
interests of the majority and those of the  minority  communities.  In  this
regard,  many  of  us  were  concerned  about  the  gradually  deteriorating
relationship between the Minister of Education - who was here earlier -  and
the Afrikaans-speaking community over  the  past  few  months,  due  to  the
Minister's - I have to say -  ill-considered  pronouncements  regarding  the
right of Afrikaans speakers to Afrikaans education.

Minister Asmal's latest effort to reach out to the Afrikaans community  must
therefore be welcomed, as it hopefully brings to  an  end  an  era  of  much
antagonism between the Minister  of  Education  and  the  Afrikaans-speaking
community. We trust, now that Afrikaans speakers and the Minister  are  once
again  within  hearing  distance  of  each  other,  that  we  will  have   a
constructive debate that will not be derailed by insensitive  pronouncements
on one hand, or by  the  right-wing  fight-back  approach  of  some  in  the
Afrikaans community, on the other, which does the cause  of  Afrikaans  more
harm than good.

Afrikaanssprekendes kan met reg  aandring  op  ten  minste  twee  Afrikaanse
universiteite - een in die noorde van die land en een in  die  suide  -  met
gelyklopende Afrikaanse onderrig aan sommige ander instellings.  Indien  dit
die vertrekpunt is van die nuwe balans wat ons gaan vind, is  dit  'n  goeie
basis om 'n sterk Suid-Afrikaanse patriotisme te bou waaraan almal deel  het
en waar ook regverdige akkommodering bestaan van  die  legitieme  aspirasies
van minderheidsgemeenskappe. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Afrikaans-speaking people can justly  insist  on  at  least  two  Afrikaans
universities - one in the north of the country and one in the south  -  with
dual instruction in Afrikaans at certain other institutions. If this is  the
point of departure of the new balance which we are to establish, it will  be
a solid base on which to build a strong sense of  South  African  patriotism
in which all can participate and where there will be  a  fair  accommodation
of the legitimate aspirations of minority groups.]

At the beginning of the term of office of the hon Deputy President,  it  was
announced that he would be the leading Government figure  in  promoting  and
protecting the rights of cultural, linguistic and religious  communities.  I
would like to request him to  take  a  closer  interest  in  the  less  than
satisfactory  relationship  between  the  Minister  of  Education  and   the
Afrikaans-speaking community and to assist us in getting it back  on  track,
because we all want it back on track.

If we are to properly address the challenge of  sustainable  development  in
South Africa, advancing the project of nation-building in such  a  way  that
we all pull in the same direction in addressing  the  massive  developmental
challenges we face, then  we  cannot  afford  the  divisive  and  polarising
arrogance which  is  still  displayed  by  a  small  group  of  increasingly
irrelevant political leaders.

These leaders, who cannot make peace with the new South Africa,  are  intent
on dragging  their  ever  smaller  groups  of  supporters  into  social  and
political isolation. Fortunately for  our  country,  their  holier-than-thou
mask has been ripped away by  their  recent  actions.  Far  from  being  the
champions of clean governance they once pretended  to  be,  they  have  been
swamped by wave after wave of sleaze and mud  of  their  own  making.  These
political swindlers have, over recent months, stumbled from one  scandal  to
the other, and their lily-white image has been replaced by their soiled  and
sordid reality.

In conclusion, no matter how huge the challenges which face us all  may  be,
we as South Africans have the unique ability to face up  to  our  challenges
and to defy the odds. We have done so in the past and we are doing so  every
day in our efforts to build a world-class country that  cares  for  all  the
people. We will  continue  to  do  so  in  partnership  and  with  a  shared
commitment to the success of South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Chairperson, Chapter 3 of our Constitution on  co-operative
government states:


  In the Republic, government is constituted as  national,  provincial  and
  local spheres of government which  are  distinctive,  interdependent  and
  interrelated.

This  chapter  in  our  Constitution  entrenches  a  number  of  progressive
principles  with  respect  to  intergovernmental  relations,  one  of  which
requires that all spheres of government and all organs  of  state  must:  ``
... respect the constitutional status, institutions,  powers  and  functions
of government in the other spheres.''

It is true that in South Africa there  is  the  problem  of  a  capacity  to
govern and administer at various levels of government. Given our history  of
Balkanisation under apartheid and the fact that the ANC  favours  a  unitary
rather than a federal system of government, it  is  perhaps  not  surprising
that on too many occasions Ministers cannot resist the  urge  to  take  over
functions which could and should be carried  out  in  local  and  provincial
government.

While most reasonable people would agree that the ANC's intervention in  the
recent mayoral shuffle in  Ekurhuleni  has  had  a  positive  outcome,  this
success is heavily outweighed by the suffocating  hand  of  intervention  in
the appointment of municipal managers in  predominantly  major  metropolitan
areas by senior Government leadership. Mayors of towns and cities,  as  well
as provincial premiers, have been appointed  on  too  many  occasions  in  a
similar manner, rather than by voters or  members  of  the  municipality  or
provincial legislature. The result of this is  not  only  political  tension
between the various arms of government, but also serious damage to the  idea
of co-operative governance which is founded on the  idea  that  the  spheres
are separate but equal.

Our democracy must not only be for the  people,  but  also  of  and  by  the
people. Our country desperately needs bigger individuals rather than  bigger
government. And the sooner power  is  actually  devolved  as  close  to  the
people as possible, the quicker we will succeed.

If we are sincere about  quality  of  life  in  the  future,  we  must  take
sustainable  development  seriously.  Our   understanding   of   sustainable
development should not be restricted to the narrow and  popular  concept  of
conservation, but should also encompass a  more  global  context,  including
agriculture and housing.

Perhaps one of the greatest unrecognised problems in South  Africa  is  that
of soil erosion, in which millions of tons of soil are lost  each  year  due
to destructive practices involving  crop  land  and  pasture  land.  It  is,
therefore,  cause  for  concern  that  government  departments,  which  were
dedicated to protecting our land resources against soil erosion,  no  longer
perform as effectively as before and are currently dysfunctional.
Unplanned urban development is another cause for concern. Once urban  sprawl
extends onto farm land,  productive  land  is  lost  forever.  It  is  worth
remembering that in South Africa we lose the equivalent of  an  average-size
magisterial district in productive land to urban development every year.

Taking into account our finite  land  resources,  which  reduce  every  year
against the backdrop of a growing  food  demand,  a  global  perspective  in
sustainable development in  agriculture  provides  greater  insight  than  a
narrow view which refers simply to retaining the beauty of the  countryside.


In conclusion, we are right to honour women tomorrow. Is it  not  also  true
that part of the reason we do so is that we know all  is  not  well  on  the
other 364 days of the year?  Perhaps  our  greatest  failure  in  the  fight
against the abuse of women is the stubborn  persistence  of  the  myth  that
raping a virgin will cure the rapist of HIV  or  Aids.  If  we  are  serious
about the emancipation of women, we  must  crush  this  myth  and  repulsive
practice so that we honour women on Women's Day 2002, not just in name,  but
also by our deeds. [Applause.]
Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, as we know, the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development will start on 26 August at  the  Sandton  Convention  Centre.  A
mere five kilometres from there, in Alexandra, many children  are  suffering
from chronic diseases as a result of malnutrition. The  facts  according  to
media reports are that one in  five  South  African  children  suffers  from
chronic malnutrition and one in 10 children  admitted  to  Africa's  largest
hospital,   Soweto's   Chris   Hani   Baragwanath,   suffers   from   severe
malnutrition.

Many South Africans still have inadequate access to food. The small town  of
Mooi River in KwaZulu-Natal, which is representative  of  many  other  small
towns in our country, is dying as poverty, unemployment and Aids take  their
toll. In Mooi River hungry women sell their bodies to truck drivers  at  the
toll gate in order to be able to feed themselves and their families.

Ons kan nie môre Vrouedag vier sonder om 'n ferm besluit  te  neem  om,  wat
moontlik ook al nodig is, op 'n volhoubare grondslag die lot te  verlig  van
dié vroue en van ander vroue wat hulle op ander plekke in  ons  land  in  'n
soortgelyke posisie bevind nie. Armoede vernietig  die  menswaardigheid  van
ons mense. In die Suid-Afrikaanse verband moet die  verligting  van  armoede
die kern vorm van elke agenda  vir  volhoubare  ekonomiese  en  maatskaplike
ontwikkeling. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[We cannot celebrate Women's Day tomorrow without taking a firm decision  on
doing whatever may be necessary to improve,  on  a  sustainable  basis,  the
fate of these women, and others who are in the same  position  elsewhere  in
the country. Poverty destroys the human dignity of our people. In the  South
African context poverty relief should form the essence  of  any  agenda  for
sustainable economic and social development.]

It is critical for all South Africans to create a  caring  society  offering
expanded opportunities. We must accord to  all  our  citizens  simple  human
dignity, equality before the law and the inalienable right  and  opportunity
to develop their individual talents  and  abilities  to  the  full.  In  our
politics, and in all other facets of our national life, we need  to  embrace
a new and inclusive South Africanism aimed at  achieving  unity  of  purpose
within a diversity of views that will always  be  the  hallmark  of  a  free
nation.

Charity begins at home. South Africa is our home. It is  also  the  home  of
the poor that I have referred to. These underfed and  starving  children  of
all races are therefore our children. These hungry women of all  races,  who
have to sell their bodies in order to survive, are our sisters. The  fathers
of all races, who have to suffer the indignity of  not  being  able  to  put
food on the table for their families, are our brothers. They  are  therefore
the  responsibility  of  the   Deputy   President.   They   are   also   the
responsibility of all of us, of each and every South African  who  is  in  a
position to assist in whatever way.

We are, however, also part of the bigger family of Africa. We are  therefore
fully supportive  of  Nepad,  and  salute  our  President  and  Government's
initiatives  and  tireless  efforts  in  this  regard.  Nepad  is  the  only
comprehensive African initiative which can bring  about  a  new  partnership
between  Africa  and  the  international  community  for   sustained   human
upliftment and poverty eradication on our continent.

Poverty and unemployment, which in turn lead to more  crime  and  contribute
to the faster spreading of HIV and more deaths as a result of Aids,  present
us with challenges of such magnitude that all of us as South Africans,  from
all language and ethnic groups and from all walks  of  life,  need  to  take
hands in not only alleviating the immediate crises, but,  most  importantly,
in  putting  in  place  sustainable  development,  which  will   result   in
sufficient growth in our economy so that enough  job  opportunities  can  be
created and sustained. Politics in the South Africa of today is therefore  a
deadly serious business, which  has  to  be  focused  on  outcomes  and  the
finding of solutions to the enormous changes we are faced with.

We cannot, as in some  other  Westminster-style  parliamentary  democracies,
afford the luxury of  an  aggressive  confrontational  style  of  opposition
politics in which the  government,  its  president  and  its  Ministers  are
forever denigrated and demonised. This style of politics in a  country  like
ours, with its history and racial composition and also  the  largely  racial
and  ethnic  composition  of  the  different  political  parties,  does  not
contribute one iota to the solving of the challenges we as  a  nation  face.
Instead,  it  contributes  to  racial  polarisation   and   leads   to   the
representatives and supporters of  such  parties  being  excluded  from  any
important decision-making about the future of this country and  its  people,
or even from having any influence whatsoever on any such decision-making.
It is our experience that the vast  majority  of  South  Africans  from  the
minority communities want to play a constructive role in helping to  address
the challenges mentioned. Many of them have unfortunately been  poisoned  by
the DP-DA's negative fight-back politics,  which  exploits  the  most  basic
fears of people. [Interjections.] When we, however, explain the fallacy  and
counterproductive consequences of fight-back politics to them and  the  need
for all of us to take hands to address the said challenges, they are  almost
always persuaded that our inclusive approach of participatory democracy  and
governance is in  the  best  interests  of  all  South  Africans,  including
themselves.  [Interjections.] In order to succeed  in  creating  sustainable
development,  which  will  effectively  address  the   enormous   challenges
mentioned, we need the goodwill and the active  participation  of  the  vast
majority of all South Africans from all race, language  and  ethnic  groups,
as well as from business and civil society.

We in the New NP will play our role in this regard to the full, and we  will
keep on convincing all South  Africans  to  become  co-builders  of  a  new,
brighter and better future, in which all our people and our country can,  on
a sustainable basis, develop to their full potential.
As we are today celebrating the opening of our new, refurbished Chamber,  it
is appropriate to reflect on the perspective which guided us as  we  drafted
the Constitution which gave birth to the NCOP,  so  as  to  continue  to  be
informed thereby. Two of the most important principles which  were  part  of
that perspective were participatory democracy and  co-operative  governance,
because we wanted to address the specific circumstances of our  country  and
because  we  emerged  out  of  our  own  definitive  past.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  member
Botha, we do not read newspapers in the House. [Interjections].

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN CAPE (Mr  E  M  Dipico):  Chairman,  small  ones
speak first, then the older ones. Hon Deputy President,  Deputy  Chairperson
of the NCOP, members of the NCOP,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  we  have  indeed
spoken in this House on many issues of critical concern to  our  people  and
our country. We have  also  made  observations  on  behalf  of  our  people,
through our representatives, on those key issues that affect their lives.

Today is very different. We celebrate 9 August  as  Women's  Day,  and  this
month we will all be engaged in issues to ensure that we lift up  once  more
one page of our Constitution and ensure that we implement what  we  said  we
would do since democracy, namely ensure that our women take  their  rightful
position in our country.

With the return of our sister, of our grandmother, or  our  ``oumagrootjie''
[great-grandmother] Sarah  Bartmann,  our  dignity  as  a  people  has  been
regained and restored. Humanity has learned a good lesson  from  this  event
and the despicable actions of so-called civilised nations.

As we celebrate this occasion, we do so with  the  full  knowledge  that  we
have laid a solid foundation for our future and that of our children.

As we are fast approaching the end of the first decade of liberation in  our
country and the beginning of the second decade of  freedom,  liberation  and
democracy, we can take stock and say that  great  achievements  and  strides
have been made. These include, as we remember today, the restoration of  the
dignity of our indigenous people. The Nama people, for instance,  can  speak
their language freely wherever they are; they can have their  culture;  they
can, at any school - as in the Northern Cape - demand  to  be  taught  in  a
Nama language. They have the Nama dance; they can dance it  in  Johannesburg
and in Cape Town. The Griqua people, the Korana and the San people  are  all
living examples of our people getting their dignity back.  But,  indeed,  we
also agree that there are a number of challenges facing us.

Throughout the country, throughout this continent,  eradicating  poverty  is
one of those big challenges. Creating new jobs in our little towns  and  big
towns is a mammoth task for all of us. Specifically in  the  Northern  Cape,
alcohol abuse and drug abuse indeed take their toll on our people and  cause
problems for all of us.

Our  challenges  must  be  to  deal  with  social   polarisation   and   the
concentration of wealth if we are to make significant headway in  the  fight
against poverty. On  that  note  we  salute  our  Minister  responsible  for
minerals and energy in our country for bringing about a new law which  gives
hope to our people. This new law gives hope  to  the  communities,  wherever
they live. In the Congo, for instance, they work on a daily basis with  rich
mineral-bearing soil, but die of  hunger  because  the  minerals  cannot  be
owned by them.
The people of Delportshoop have an unemployment rate of 80%, but  they  have
minerals worth billions. We believe that through the implementation of  this
law, our communities in the Richtersveld, in  Namaqualand  and  Prieska  can
benefit greatly and wealth can come their way in  some  small  way,  as  has
happened to the Bafokeng community. This requires a national effort and  the
commitment of our people if we are going to succeed.

We have to continue to  develop  fraternal  relations  with  the  continent.
"Afrika ke Nako." [Africa, now is the time.] And, if we say  that,  we  have
to  ensure  that  indeed  we  build  partnerships   -   as   provinces,   as
municipalities, as people - with our people  in  Africa,  our  brothers  and
sisters.

In our province we have  undertaken  various  initiatives  in  this  regard.
Bordering Namibia and Botswana, we have  a  twinning  arrangement  with  the
region of Karas in Namibia. This relationship has been ongoing for the  past
three years and we are  now  hosting  an  international  conference  in  the
province to develop the San languages, a challenge for the  Namibian  people
and the people in the Northern Cape. We hosted  the  Botswana  delegation  a
few  months  ago  to  share  best  practices  in  the  legislature  and   in
governance, particularly in "the Government meets the  people''  initiative.
They joined us in two of those meetings to find out how  we  are  succeeding
in ensuring that democracy is alive.

Long-standing relationships and  historical  and  cultural  ties  have  been
strengthened between these two countries, particularly between  our  people.
Recently, we sent an eight-member delegation, composed of  seven  women,  to
Tanzania to reconnect with the freedom  struggle's  legacy  in  Mazimbu  and
Dakawa and to learn more  about  the  successes  in  the  rural  development
areas. I think there are a lot of stories to tell that we are able to  share
not only with the people of Europe, but our  brothers  and  sisters,  having
dealt with these issues before.

Rural development is a challenge to all of  us  and  the  rural  communities
expect from us more development and leadership. It  is  imperative  that  we
develop rural industries to  provide  employment  opportunities  and  ensure
that rural development occurs and addresses the needs of  rural  communities
in a sustainable manner.

Indeed, it is unfortunate - I would like to say to the  Deputy  President  -
that the Minister responsible for transport just left,  because  we  have  a
message  for  him,  but  through  the  Deputy  President's  good  work   and
leadership, I am sure, he will get this message. We  are  very  clear  about
the economy of the province. We know  the  strengths  and  weaknesses.  With
regard to the Karoo, public  transport  must  be  revived  in  the  De  Aar,
Colesberg and Noupoort areas.

Train transportation  can  seriously  change  the  lives  of  those  people,
without a lot of money having to be pumped in.  Train  transportation  alone
can bring life to an area. Here, I am speaking  on  behalf  of  the  Eastern
Cape, the Northern Cape and Gauteng too, because it is  very  important.  It
has killed ...  [Interjections] ... in Gauteng.  I  am  saying  that  it  is
important for us to come back and say, what a waste  of  infrastructure.  We
have paid so much for it and we are leaving it to rot.  That  is  not  fair,
and I think that that point must be noted and we have to do  something.  The
will must be there, politically, to drive this matter.

HON MEMBERS: Hoor, hoor! [Hear, hear!]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN CAPE (Mr E M Dipico): Regarding rural  nodes,  I
agree with my colleague Popo Molefe. They  have  been  doing  very  well  in
terms of the Kgalagadi node. These are the areas to concentrate  on  because
they are where the poorest of the poor live. Again, when  we  come  back  to
these areas, focusing on sanitation and water - as the Deputy President  has
articulated - is correct.

When we go through the Karoo  areas  of  Hanover,  Hantam  and  Calvinia  we
realise that without water there will be no  sustainable  economy  in  those
areas. They need water. We must draw it from somewhere. The  pipes  and  the
plans are there, and if only we could draw water, we could do away with  the
bucket system. Otherwise, the bucket system is there to stay.

This is a very difficult situation. When we  give  them  the  pit  latrines,
they say: ``Nee, nee. Ons soek die water-een. Ons druk  hom  net;  dan  loop
alles reg''. [``No, no. We want the one with the  water.  We  just  have  to
press it and everything is allright.''] It  is  very  difficult.  They  say,
``Why do we have waterborne sewage in Kimberley? Why do you want to give  us
pit latrines?'' It is a very difficult issue. If one tells them  that  there
is no water, they say: ``There is the dam. Just  draw  the  water  to  us.''
These are the challenges we face. We can bring life to the  rural  areas  if
the will is there. We only need the will.

We are starting to see results in the Kgalagadi rural area node through  the
collaborative efforts and co-ordinated interaction of all the  role-players.
The two provinces, the municipalities, and the mining houses  in  that  area
are contributing very well indeed, as are the people who bring  their  sweat
labour to these types of projects. But,  most  important,  is  the  champion
leading us there, Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. She is really  a  driving
force for all of us to succeed. I say thank  you  to  her,  because  we  are
succeeding in the Kgalagadi node in making a difference in the lives of  our
people.

With regard to urban development, urban renewal and Galeshewe, we have  been
waiting for a long time for the moneys from the national Government. It  has
finally arrived. That champion has now been appointed as Minister  Geraldine
Fraser-Moleketi. A ground-breaking meeting will be taking place on  Tuesday,
at which all role-players will be focusing on  implementation,  rather  than
on policy and all sorts of plans.
Plans are already on the table. The focus on  implementation  is  to  ensure
what my colleague Sam Shilowa said - that we now bring  the  money  and  the
resources to ensure that the projects in the  implementation  plans  can  be
unfolded. I think we can do this with the proper co-ordination, the  way  we
are doing it in the Kgalagadi. If we can get that type of  synergy,  we  are
in a position to succeed.

Finally, as a province, we will contribute - the Kalahari people, the  Karoo
people, the Namaqua people - to the Johannesburg  summit.  South  Africa  is
the host, therefore that host includes the Northern Cape and we are part  of
South Africa. We will be  there.  We  will  be  there  because  we  will  be
exhibiting the good things we have in this part of South Africa  called  the
Northern Cape. The good people with good  hospitality,  who  kiss  everybody
even if they do not know where they come  from  -  that  is  what  we  need.
[Laughter.] They will be sober, I know what hon members are  thinking.  They
will all be sober. They will be contributing.

Arts and crafts by our people will also be exhibited there.  There  will  be
no time for the people to see the better part of South Africa, but  if  they
and those tourists come to the Northern Cape  this  is  the  time  to  visit
because the flowers in this part of the country - in the  Western  Cape  and
the Northern Cape - will be bright. From above one will see flowers  like  a
carpet. It is beautiful! Beautiful! If one has never seen  this,  then  this
is the time to travel north. If one wants to make those  who  are  going  to
visit during the World Summit on Sustainable  Development  come  back  again
and again, one must take them  to  the  floral  areas  of  the  Namaqualand.
[Applause.]

The PREMIER OF KWAZULU-NATAL (Mr L P H M Mtshali): Chairperson,  hon  Deputy
President of the country and members of  the  NCOP,  the  challenges  facing
sustainable development have, in the  past  two  years,  become  a  critical
issue for us in KwaZulu-Natal.

Our provincial cabinet deliberated at length on what our  priorities  should
be in the face of escalating poverty as a consequence of  HIV/Aids  and  the
poor performance of the  economy,  which  has  resulted  in  wide-scale  job
losses. These discussions led to our identifying six critical areas for  the
work of our government in KwaZulu-Natal. These include  the  eradication  of
poverty and inequality, managing the impact of  HIV/Aids  and  reducing  its
spread,  re-engineering  and  enhancing  integrated  service   delivery   in
government,  investing  in  infrastructure,  strengthening  governance,  and
developing human capability.

We took this step as an acknowledgement of the crisis that  we  are  in  and
the huge responsibility that we have as a provincial government. We  do  not
want to be found neglectful in our response to the suffering of our  people,
nor do we want to waste scarce public-sector resources  on  programmes  that
are not priorities.

Through the work of our Cabinet and clusters, we are endeavouring to  ensure
that  these  priorities  are   translated   into   properly   conceptualised
programmes that have  an  adequate  resource  base  and  are  monitored  and
reported on on a regular basis. As we have indicated in our priorities,  the
greatest  challenges  for  the  province  of  KwaZulu-Natal  are  those   of
eradicating poverty and of reducing the spread and impact of HIV/Aids.

KwaZulu-Natal had an estimated 80 000 Aids-related deaths  in  2001.  During
this period, it was also estimated that about 40 000 of  our  children  were
infected with HIV/Aids by their mothers. It is estimated that  possibly  36%
or even as much as 40% of  our  women  who  give  birth  are  HIV  positive.
KwaZulu-Natal has the highest prevalence of HIV infection in  South  Africa.
Possibly 35% of our population is already HIV-positive.

It was my growing  awareness  of  the  critical  implications  of  the  Aids
pandemic for the future wellbeing of our province that prompted me  to  work
in co-operation with our provincial department of health and the cabinet  as
a whole to develop an expanded MTCP programme to ensure the distribution  of
the drug nevirapine throughout the province.

The  consequences  of  the  pandemic  for  our  province   are   potentially
catastrophic at both an economic and a social level. As a province, we  need
continually to revisit our programmes to  assess  their  effectiveness.  The
provincial HIV/Aids action unit was established in 1999, and  a  year  later
the intersectoral  cabinet  initiative,  namely  Aids  Challenge  2000,  was
launched.

To  date,  significant  progress  has  been  made  in  that   484   HIV/Aids
communicators have been trained and integrated into  the  community  health-
worker programme. Currently,  2  780  community  health  workers  have  been
recruited to manage awareness programmes at neighbourhood  level.  Voluntary
counselling and testing have  been  implemented  in  nine  identified  sites
across the province.

Thirty home-based trainers have been trained in the  nationally  recommended
training manual for home-based care. Each  health  district  has  identified
nongovernmental organisations to  render  home-based  care  in  its  region.
Partnerships  with   nongovernmental   organisations   and   community-based
organisations, as well  as  the  private  sector,  have  been  strengthened.
Currently, 34 organisations across KwaZulu-Natal are working with  the  Aids
action  unit.  There  are  also  19  private-sector  companies  working   in
collaboration with the unit to develop  HIV/Aids  programmes  and  workplace
policies.

Life-skills programmes  have  been  implemented  in  secondary  and  primary
schools, with a total of 1 558 educators trained to date. Twenty-three drop-
in  centres  have  been  established  across  the  province  and  are  fully
operational. Our main  challenge  now  is  to  ensure  that  a  response  to
HIV/Aids  is  mainstreamed  into  all  our  major  policies,  including  our
provincial development strategy, and that every sector  develops  programmes
to mitigate the impact of HIV/Aids.

We are wrestling with other diseases that ravage in  particular  our  lesser
developed communities.  Cholera  is  a  chronic  problem  during  the  rainy
season,  reminding  us  of  the  urgent  need  to  ensure  that  our   rural
communities in particular have access to potable water.

The department of traditional and local government affairs has allocated  R6
million from its budget in  the  form  of  the  indigent  support  grant  to
support the implementation of policies for the indigent at municipal  level.
This should bring  some  relief  to  poverty-stricken  households  in  urban
settlements. But the question remains: What assistance is there for  poverty
stricken households in remote rural areas?

The rainy season also brings  with  it  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of
malaria, particularly in the coastal areas. All of  these  challenges  place
an  enormous  strain  on  our  health  services  and  call  for  intensified
intersectoral   development   efforts   to   improve    the    environmental
circumstances that our people live in.
Linked to our fight against Aids is our fight against  poverty.  Almost  all
provincial departments have programmes and projects that impact  on  poverty
alleviation or reduction. Currently, an amount of approximately  R8  billion
has been allocated to a broad range of  poverty  alleviation  and  reduction
programmes. Of  this,  approximately  R5,8  billion  is  allocated  for  the
provision of social security grants to the citizens of the province.

A significant proportion of the R8,6 billion allocated to the department  of
education and culture's budget targets the reversal  of  imbalances  in  the
distribution  of  educational  resources  within  the  province.  While   we
acknowledge the sterling work done by many of our departments,  our  concern
is that programmes to  combat  poverty  are  commonly  very  fragmented  and
poorly conceptualised. Research into our province  also  suggests  that  our
efforts and resources are not necessarily reaching poor citizens.

We are now  shifting  our  emphasis  to  more  effective  co-ordination  and
improved conceptualisation and management of these  programmes.  During  the
course of this year, we have been developing a provincial poverty  reduction
strategy with the technical assistance of  the  United  Nations  Development
Programme.

The high levels of unemployment are serious, aggravating our  programmes  on
poverty and disease. While  the  overall  figure  for  unemployment  in  the
province is estimated to be  approximately  24%,  the  estimated  number  of
economically ineffective people in some of our municipalities is as high  as
64%. These very high levels  threaten  the  security  of  our  province  and
contribute to the high crime rates. It is for this  reason  that  programmes
that create employment and sustainable livelihoods are so  critical  to  the
work of the provincial government.

Our department of  social  welfare  and  population  development  has  spent
approximately R5,5 million on programmes aimed  at  capacitating  women  and
communities to escape the scourge  of  poverty.  Similarly,  Community-based
Public Works programmes have  been  implemented,  with  50%  of  the  labour
provided  by  women  and  15%  by  the  youth.  In  addition,  180  emerging
contractors have been trained.

Central to all our poverty reduction and development efforts is the need  to
address the issue of powerlessness. Poor citizens can no longer be  regarded
as the  passive  recipients  of  our  technical  schemes  and  provision  of
services. Poor citizens have a huge role to play  in  actively  shaping  our
programmes to make them sustainable, affordable  and  appropriate  to  local
needs and local values.

In keeping with the theme of today's debate, I want  to  reiterate  that  if
the understanding of sustainable development is about improving the  quality
of human life, enabling people to  realise  their  full  potential  to  live
lives of dignity and fulfilment, and conserving and improving  the  national
resource base of our planet, we have an urgent responsibility as leaders  to
ensure that in  our  province  our  poor  citizens  and  those  living  with
HIV/Aids are the subjects of the programmes we devise and  not  the  objects
of high-flying plans and programmes that bear no relation to reality.

It is for this reason that I focus on poverty and  HIV/Aids  in  my  address
today.  With  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  opening   in
Johannesburg later this month the flurry of  excitement  about  the  African
Union and the enormous challenges of Nepad, there is a real danger  that  we
may neglect the needs of our humble citizens that stood in  queues  to  vote
us into leadership positions. They are our first responsibility.

Let us clearly articulate our plans for their sustainable  development,  for
the improvement of their quality  of  life  and  for  the  conservation  and
protection of our natural resource base. Until we have done that  and  fully
addressed the challenges that face us as leaders, we are in grave danger  of
failing to appreciate and respond to the crisis we are in. In this  way,  we
may become a part of the problem  rather  than  the  solution,  which  could
haunt us for generations to come.

I say thank you once more to the House for the opportunity of  participating
in this debate. [Applause.]

Dr Z L  MKHIZE  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  it  looks  like  I  need  an
orientation course on the technology of this House.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: You  are  a  medicine  man,  you  are  not  a
mechanic.

Dr Z L MKHIZE: Chairperson, Deputy President, premiers and  hon  members  of
the NCOP, I would like to thank the Deputy President for  a  very  inspiring
speech and also take this opportunity  to  congratulate  our  President  and
Government on the successful launch of  the  African  Union  and  Nepad.  We
believe that our provinces and our people must also take up  the  challenge,
which is how our programmes are able to  support  the  overall  strategy  of
developing Africa as a continent through Nepad.

We need to be able to also answer the question  of  how  our  programmes  in
general are geared towards  solving  our  priority  challenges,  namely  the
problems of poverty, unemployment, ill health, including HIV/Aids and  other
diseases, crime and abuse of women and children.

Numerous opportunities have been identified in KwaZulu-Natal.  The  province
has shown a willingness to embrace the idea of global collectivity  and  has
acknowledged the fact that worldwide markets are  now  accessible  to  South
Africans more than ever before.  But  for  these  opportunities  are  to  be
successfully exploited for the benefit of all our provinces,  and  evidenced
a partnership between Government and industry has to be enhanced.  There  is
also a strong acknowledgement that while linking up with the  entire  world,
we need to strengthen partnerships with our neighbours in Africa as part  of
the  province's  alignment  with  Nepad,  which  calls  for  integrated  and
sustainable economic development across the continent.

Currently, KwaZulu-Natal has identified a number of  key  economic  projects
which are expected to contribute to the  socioeconomic  development  of  the
entire Southern African region and enable the  country  to  play  an  active
role in the global economy. There is a  mood  of  optimism  in  the  public-
sector and private-sector partnership which, we call the growth coalition.

Amongst the flagship projects that  are  expected  to  have  a  lasting  and
sustainable bearing on the  lives  of  our  inhabitants,  are  the  proposed
multibillion rand Dube Trade Port at La Mercy, which also includes the  King
Shaka International Airport to replace  the  Durban  airport.  Complementing
the airport will be an industrial development zone with  a  freight  village
and cyberport, all aimed at ensuring that the  province  achieves  a  modern
connection to the hi-tech-oriented world economy.

The integration of the African economies will have a huge influence  on  all
sectors of the province's economy. The construction of the new airport  will
also enable direct flights to  the  province.  Also,  the  other  programmes
already   relate   to   the   multimillion   rand   development   of   basic
infrastructure, such as access roads, trinational ecotourism focus  projects
- which is the Lebombo SDI - and the programme recently chosen by the UN  as
a World Heritage Site at St Lucia, which is fast becoming a hive of  tourism
activity. These projects will have incredible  spin-offs  and  a  multiplier
effect on the province and the country's social stability as they will  also
create opportunities for SMMEs and the scope to  accelerate  black  economic
empowerment.

In  acknowledging  socioeconomic  disparities  created  by   the   apartheid
government, the Government is investing in many sectors aimed  at  promoting
equity and bringing  the  rural  communities  into  the  mainstream  of  the
economy. Through the Integrated Rural Development Strategy, communities  are
being  financially  assisted  in  starting   their   own   income-generating
projects. And, to ensure sustainability  of  these  enterprise  initiatives,
which are often transformed into  co-operatives,  communities  are  afforded
skills training to capacitate them.

We are also proud that KwaZulu-Natal was chosen as  the  birthplace  of  the
African Union and Nepad. This has  boosted  the  province's  confidence  and
determination to play  a  meaningful  role  in  the  reconstruction  of  the
African continent. It has given us the impetus to go ahead full  steam  with
the implementation of key projects that  would  generate  job  opportunities
for the impoverished sections of our society.

The  Lubombo  Spatial  Development  Initiative  letter  also  indicated   an
additional aspect here which is the agreement of  co-operation  among  South
Africa, Mozambique and  Swaziland  to  mark  the  joint  campaign  to  fight
malaria. This is part of the ``Roll Back  Malaria''  campaign,  which  is  a
continental programme of the heads of state and ministries of  health.  This
programme is aimed  at  reducing  the  disease  burden  of  malaria  and  at
encouraging tourism across the region.

This programme has actually been so successful that it  has  resulted  in  a
reduction of 76% in malaria cases in the northern part of  KwaZulu-Natal,  a
reduction of 60% in Swaziland and a reduction of  40%  in  Mozambique.  This
has been one of the very successful projects, indicating that  regional  co-
operation can result in a lot of progress. The  technical  capacity  in  our
facilities and the expertise that we have as a result of our  experience  in
fighting these particular diseases are actually at  the  disposal  of  South
Africa and can be used in  other  countries.  For  example,  our  scientists
based in Jozini have become part  of  an  international  effort  to  do  GIS
mapping of malaria patterns for  the  population  in  Africa  south  of  the
equator.

I also believe that the issue of HIV/Aids remains one of the  major  threats
to the development of our economy and the programme on  the  eradication  of
poverty. I think we all need to remember that we are part of  the  continent
that  carries  the  largest  burden  of  HIV/Aids.  So  all  our  plans  and
strategies to succeed, our fight against HIV/Aids must be won. To  begin  to
see the reversal of the rising trend of HIV, we  in  this  country  have  to
begin to do things that we have not done before, or to do more of  what  has
been shown to work in the past.

It is in this vein that we welcome the allocations of  the  funds  from  the
HIV/Aids  Global  Trust  Fund,  and  KwaZulu-Natal  is  very  proud  of  the
application that we placed as part of our country's effort. As we  announced
a few weeks ago - and from our discussion with the Minister of  Health,  who
assisted us in regularising the process of receiving  these  funds  -  these
funds will in fact be received through the SA  National  Aids  Council.  Our
technical teams from both the  KwaZulu-Natal  government  and  the  national
Government will deal with the technicals details  of  ironing  out  all  the
submissions. However, we reiterate that there is  no  risk  of  these  funds
being lost and what we did was really to regularise the process that we  all
got into in a very short space of time, with very  few  guidelines.  We  are
now quite happy that they are in place. Therefore, I want to  say  that  the
calls for the national Minister to resign as a  result  of  this  issue  are
actually rejected because they have no basis.

We also, at the same time, want to welcome the hand of partnership  that  we
see developing in the private sector. We have noticed  that  some  employers
are beginning to offer antiretrovirals to their own staff.  We  are  talking
in particular about Anglo American and I  have  noticed  that  BP  has  also
offered to do the same. We want to encourage all of the  private  sector  to
follow suit.

I just want to clear up one issue, namely  that  of  nevirapine,  which  has
been raised here. It has nothing to do with the Minister.  It  is  an  issue
that has to do with the fact that although nevirapine  is  registered  under
the MCC, when the FDA in America requested certain documentation  they  were
unable to get it from the manufacturing company. As a  result,  the  queries
have come to the point where the MCC in this country is forced to relook  at
the registration process.

However, this has nothing to do with the  Minister.  It  is  an  independent
process involving scientists and a registration process the  Government  has
no hand in. A scientist is  leading  that  process.  If  they  say  we  must
continue, we should continue. If they  say  that  we  should  not  continue,
there must be a reason for that. We are hopeful  about  the  process.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Hon Chairperson, hon  Deputy  President,  hon  premiers  from
provinces, special delegates and hon members in this House, I greet  you  in
the name of the Lord.

If you allow me, Chairperson, I want to approach the  subject  from  another
angle. I want to quote from the Book of Books:


  For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat. I was  thirsty  and  you
  gave me nothing to drink. I was a stranger and you did not invite me  in.
  I needed clothes and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison  and
  you did not look after me. Then they also will answer, `Lord, when did we
  see you hungry or thirsty, or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in
  prison and did not help you?' He will  reply,  `I  tell  you  the  truth.
  Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for
  me.'

This is a challenge to the global village in that we are  interdependent  on
one another, and that is what can sustain any development.

people should share the little that they have. He  again  says  that  people
cannot achieve anything when they are divided. He  again  says  that  people
should make preparations in good time. He concludes by saying  that  success
comes through hard work.]

Thirty years ago the world community gathered in Stockholm for the first  UN
Conference on the Human Environment. The event  was,  for  all  intents  and
purposes, a watershed.

Ten years ago the international  community  gathered  again  for  the  first
Earth  Summit  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  with  the  conceptual  breakthrough  of
sustainable development. The summit generated the  blueprint,  better  known
as Agenda 21, for action to be taken globally  in  every  area  where  human
activity impacts on the environment.

The Rio de Janeiro summit was historic in the sense that it  focused  global
attention on the planet's environmental problems and showed that they  were,
in  fact,  inextricably  linked  to  global  economic  conditions  and   the
challenges of social justice. It demonstrated that if people  are  poor  and
national economies are weak, the environment suffers.  Moreover,  it  showed
that if the environment  is  abused  and  overconsumed,  people  suffer  and
economies decline.

The World Summit on Sustainable Development, to be held  on  South  Africa's
shores in 18 days' time from now,  will  not  necessarily  dwell  on  purely
environmental issues, but, more importantly,  focus  on  the  needs  of  the
developing world, that is the link  between poverty, human  development  and
the  environment.  We  believe  that  sustainability  is  one  of  the  most
important issues of the 21st century and that  the  focus  on  environmental
protection per se is not enough.

The summit will demonstrate how the people  of  the  developing  world  have
suffered disproportionally as a result of the high consumption by  the  rich
countries of the earth's natural resources. The summit will also  show  that
evidence of these vexing issues are indeed acute on the  African  continent.
In fact, poverty and inequality on the African continent  are  some  of  the
greatest threats to global sustainability in the 21st century.

Yes, the statistics do not make  for  good  reading.  More  that  1  billion
people are without safe drinking water.  Twice  that  number  lack  adequate
sanitation, and more than 3 million people  die  every  year  from  diseases
caused by unsafe water.

Our concerns as Africans are that the reality of the world  today  is  still
much like that of 1992, a world  where  poverty  and  inequality  are  still
prevalent. We still live in a world where the gap between the rich  and  the
poor continues to widen, where  the  poor  are  still  victims  of  cultural
destruction, social injustice, economic debt and a struggle  for  the  basic
human rights of a clean and healthy environment.

These social ills also manifest themselves acutely in  our  country.  It  is
for these reasons that the World Summit on Sustainable Development  presents
us as South Africans and indeed as Africans with the unique  opportunity  to
communicate our vision,  contained  in  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development, of a more just and equitable world.  Moreover,  it  affords  us
the  opportunity  to  address  the  Southern  African  region's  sustainable
development challenges.
President Thabo Mbeki enunciated very clearly on 8 February  this  year  the
need to combat poverty in our country. Hence, our  country's  proposal  that
the  overarching  theme  of  the  2002  World  Summit  should   be   poverty
eradication as the key to sustainable development.

As the host country, South Africa believes that  the  following  imperatives
should   underpin   deliberations:   access   to   water   and   sanitation;
environmental  health;  agricultural  productivity,  especially  in  Africa;
energy and health biodiversity; sustainable human settlement; and peace  and
stability.

These imperatives will require social and economic  interventions  if  their
targets are to be met. Therein lies  the  challenge  for  the  summit  -  to
ensure  a  fundamental  shift  between  economic  relations,   between   the
developing and the developed world. It  will  require  much  more  than  the
promises made in Rio de Janeiro, and it  comes  down  to  this:  either  the
developed world protect their own environment or help the  developing  world
defeat poverty.

In conclusion, the Secretary-General of the UN, Kofi  Annan,  summed  it  up
brilliantly in a letter to the heads of state  and  governments  of  the  G8
when he said: ``These are goals  set  for  the  world,  by  the  world.''  I
conclude: "Kodumela moepathutse, ga go lehumo le le tswang gaufi."  [Success
comes through hard work.] The World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  is
coming. [Applause.]

Cllr O MLABA (Salga): Chairperson, hon Deputy  President,  hon  premiers  of
provinces, hon members, we are approximately 18 months into the final  phase
of local government's dispensation. During this period  municipalities  have
had to engage with their establishment processes, with  the  appointment  of
municipal managers and top level  management,  with  the  implementation  of
local government legislation,  integrated  development  planning,  with  the
provision of free basic services and  with  the  extension  of  services  to
previously unserviced areas.

The new dispensation also brought with it new  governance  challenges,  such
as the establishment of community  participation  structures  to  facilitate
municipal decision-making. This goes hand in hand with  the  development  of
appropriate  communication  policies  and  capacity-building  strategies  to
enable  communities  to  participate.  The   reality   is   that   not   all
municipalities are at the  same  level  of  progress  in  respect  of  these
matters, and it will take a considerable amount of  time  before  all  these
challenges are adequately addressed.

The  issues  for  discussion  today  are   gender   equality,   co-operative
governance and sustainable development. Salga, as the national  organisation
that represents  municipalities,  is  the  chief  instrument  through  which
policy development and strategies are initiated. As early as our  launch  in
1996, Salga adopted the strategic objective of achieving gender equality  as
a priority for democratic local government.

We played a pivotal role in the International Union  of  Local  Authorities,
IULA, worldwide declaration on women in local government.  We  did  this  on
the understanding that organised local government can be the umbilical  cord
that connects local government to the vision of a democratic, nonsexist  and
nonracial society, committed to the promotion of equality and human  rights.


It is a belief that we can  play  a  critical  role  in  reconstructing  and
developing a society that respects  the  rights  of  our  grandmothers,  our
mothers, our wives, our partners,  our  daughters  and  our  granddaughters.
Hopefully this is the legacy we can leave behind for  the  next  generation.
In co-operation with our counterparts outside South Africa, Salga  has  been
engaged in a gender programme for the last two years.  The  purpose  of  the
programme is to provide capacity for Salga to play its  constitutional  role
in local regimes.

Currently, the focus is on the following  key  areas,  that  is  to  develop
capacity within Salga to develop and build the capacity of local  government
councillors, to develop a policy on gender, and to  share  experiences  both
within the context of South Africa and indeed on the continent.

The implication of this is that there has to be commitment  at  the  highest
level of municipalities.  Local  government  leadership  has  to  drive  the
processes, otherwise we will not succeed. Whilst we  have  made  significant
strides in improving our capacity to engage with gender  and  women  issues,
we face serious challenges in this regard. One of these  challenges  centres
around  our  ability  to  participate  consistently   and   effectively   in
structures in which we should be engaging. The harsh reality  for  Salga  is
the fact that we do not have the kind of capacity that is  demanded  by  our
mandate. As long as this is the case, Salga will always be perceived as  not
doing its job.

This brings me to the next critical issue of this debate  and  that  is  co-
operative governance. As I stated earlier, Salga is the  national  voice  of
local government and the chief  instrument  through  which  national  policy
development  and  strategies  are  initiated  for  the   local   sphere   of
government. Salga has, since its inception, endeavoured  to  participate  in
all intergovernmental forums in which local government-related  matters  are
discussed, with varying degrees of success, of course.

I will not dwell on the past, suffice  to  say  that  the  intergovernmental
relations   audit   highlighted   some   of   the   deficiencies   in    our
intergovernmental relations system, in general, and in  Salga's  performance
therein, in particular.  Since  then,  however,  we  have  made  significant
strides in playing a more prominent role in intergovernmental relations  and
in co-operative governance.

The most significant  event  for  Salga  was  the  special  President's  Co-
ordinating Council of 14 December 2001. At that meeting  the  transformation
of local government was  put  under  the  microscope  and  a  very  detailed
programme of action was developed, with the express aim of accelerating  the
transformation process. It must be pointed out that up until  then  the  PCC
consisted only of the President and nine premiers.  The  membership  of  the
PCC will soon be extended to include  representation  by  local  government.
This will have the impact that we expect Salga to have.

With regard to sustainable development, as Salga we subscribe to the  three-
tier view of sustainable development, that it is economically, socially  and
environmentally driven. Under economic development, we cluster  issues  such
as  trade,  finance,  investment  and  technology  transfer.  Under   social
development, we cluster issues such as water, health, energy, food  security
and poverty alleviation. Under environmental development, we cluster  issues
such as climate change, land degradation, biodiversity, the atmosphere,  the
oceans, and so on.

Salga's involvement in matters  relating  to  sustainable  development  and,
more particularly, to Local Agenda 21 originated after signing a  memorandum
agreement with the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism in  March
2001. The agreement provided that Salga must co-ordinate the  implementation
of Local Agenda 21 at local level. Furthermore, Salga  has  to  act  as  the
secretariat for Local Agenda 21  at  national  level  in  making  sure  that
programmes of Agenda 21 are implemented in  our  municipalities.  Salga  has
advocated for the inclusion  of  Agenda  21  principles  in  the  integrated
development plans of municipalities with the focus on  social  and  economic
development.

Therefore, IDP processes have to capture social, economic and  environmental
issues. And one of the key objectives of our municipalities is to  undertake
a  consultative  process  with  our  communities  in  terms   of   planning,
implementing and monitoring in order to achieve consensus  on  Local  Agenda
21.

There is, therefore, a clear link between municipalities and the  objectives
of the upcoming World Summit as the many problems  and  solutions  addressed
by Agenda 21 have roots in their local activity.  Delegates  at  the  summit
should  therefore  understand  and  take  into  account  that  in  practice,
municipalities  construct,  operate  and  oversee  planning  processes   and
establish local environmental  policies  and  regulations.  Their  role  and
participation  in  the  World   Summit   on   Sustainable   Development   in
Johannesburg and thereafter should have a positive  impact  on  implementing
programmes of Agenda 21 at local level.

In preparation for the summit, Salga has hosted an African  mayors'  meeting
with the purpose of ensuring that African priorities and  issues  are  taken
into account at summit deliberations. The main objective of the meeting  was
to ensure that matters of primary concern to Africa  are  not  sidelined  at
the summit. We also had to formulate and agree on African  local  government
recommendations for action at the World Summit in Johannesburg.

I will skip saying quite a lot, save to say  that,  in  conclusion,  I  have
highlighted the importance of gender issues for local government in  general
and Salga in  particular.  The  effective  participation  of  Salga  in  our
intergovernmental relations system is critical if  Salga  is  to  become  an
equal partner in co-operative governance. Sustainable development is one  of
the pillars of municipal integrated development plans, and the  summit  will
reinforce such priorities for  national,  provincial  and  local  government
worldwide.

I want to take this opportunity on behalf of the local government sphere  to
wish all women in South Africa  an  enjoyable  and  productive  Women's  Day
tomorrow, and I want to assure them that Salga  is  striving  with  them  to
promote gender equality in our country and on the continent. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN PROVINCE (Mr N A  Ramatlhodi):  Chairperson  and
Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,  Deputy  President  of   the   Republic,
colleagues  and  hon  members,  allow  me  to  begin  by  congratulating  my
colleague Mr Van Schalkwyk in absentia on his elevation  to  and  subsequent
mounting of the wild horse known as the Western Cape  premiership.  I  would
like to take this opportunity to wish him well, and  I  hope  that  we  will
continue to work together to  strengthen  co-operative  governance  in  this
country. I would also like to take this opportunity to salute  our  women  -
grandmothers, mothers, wives, lovers and daughters - and, lastly,  to  raise
our banners in the memory of our grandmother, Sarah Baartmann.

Talking about today's theme, I am sure it has  been  inspired  by  the  fact
that we are meeting on the eve of one of the most important summits in  this
century, a summit which seeks to ensure that life continues on  earth  until
eternity, that we sustain ourselves and those that we produce, and  preserve
the world in trust and on behalf of those who must come after  us.  In  this
regard, to sustain ourselves we have to, in the first  place,  create  peace
in our world.

I wish to congratulate the President and the Deputy President and all  those
who have  been  assisting  in  making  sure  that  there  is  peace  on  our
continent. I believe that the successes that are being  scored  have  become
legendary and monumental. I am sure that as they toil  at  night  trying  to
get warring parties together they know that they have the support of all  of
us in the provinces.

When we talk about Nepad, I think there are ordinary  people  out  there  in
the villages and towns, unsung heroes and heroines, who are  striving  on  a
daily basis for self-betterment and for community development. Indeed,  they
are at the coalface of the  struggle  for  what  we  call  Nepad.  They  are
sustaining themselves and helping their communities, most of the  time  with
very little help. Occasionally we have a glimpse  of  these  people  through
programmes such as ``Community Builder of the Year'', ``Woman of the  Year''
and so on. But there are many others out there who are engaged in  the  very
struggle that we are talking about.

What we sought to do in the province was to convene a meeting of  all  these
people, the winners and the nonwinners, because they were all winners, in  a
sense. We said: What is it that makes those who succeed  succeed,  and  what
is  it  that  makes  those  who  do  not  succeed  fail?  Could  they  share
experiences?  What  role  could  we  play  as  Government  to  support   the
initiatives of ordinary people?

We realised that this provided the raw  seeds  for  development  within  our
communities, that we could give them the training and support  and,  at  the
end of the day, that we could give them the market, using  our  relationship
with the private sector and using the fact that the Government itself is  in
charge of most of the institutions. For instance, talking about  vegetables,
one should buy vegetables from these people, because part of the problem  is
not so much that people do not have a  job,  but  that  they  produce  these
things and sit in front of a house and there is no market. In the  meantime,
as the state, we purchase elsewhere, leaving them there.
These are some of the things that I thought we should really share as a  way
of exchanging notes. One of the examples that I can give in this  regard  is
of  somebody  who  trained  women  to  produce  sweets,  using  very  simple
technology. After the women have produced these  sweets,  we  then  get  the
African Bank to buy them, giving the African Bank incentives.  So  there  is
an end market.

We have gone on to look into the co-operatives in our  province.  I  do  not
know how many members here know about the Outspan oranges that  we  used  to
pride ourselves in. They came from Zebediela and many  other  farms  in  our
province. What we discovered was that productivity had gone down  to  levels
which were totally unacceptable. The reason  could  be  that  regardless  of
whether the people produced or not, they got paid, because  they  are  state
employees on those farms. So what we  have  done  is  to  suggest  to  these
people that we want to form a co-operative and give them a  farm  that  they
could take as theirs. But, because we know they are not, as  yet,  ready  to
produce at a sustainable level, we will bring in  white  commercial  farmers
to support them. These farmers will bring  in,  on  a  contract  basis,  the
money and, secondly, the experience, so that people will work  together  and
grow into the job. That  is  how  we  managed  to  send  abroad  world-class
oranges from Guillenberg which  were  fit  to  feed  the  World  Cup  soccer
players in Japan.

Still on the same issue, one of the things we have  done  was  to  say  that
whilst these people are training in the field, we must create  possibilities
for them also to receive some formal instruction. Hence, two  years  ago  we
stopped the intake of new students into agricultural  colleges  so  that  we
did not continue producing the extension  officers  of  old,  but,  instead,
produced farmers who could go out and farm.

I think we do have a problem  on  the  political  question  of  co-operative
governance, because these technical colleges are technically the  sphere  of
higher education. One might find that the Department of Education  does  not
have the vision we have, but comes and  takes  the  school,  hands  it  over
somewhere and the school is destroyed.

So the question of whether we need provinces or  not,  of  whether  we  need
local government - or national Government - or not,  I  think,  is  not  the
real issue. The question is what it is that can best be done at  what  level
of governance.  In  that  context,  there  will  not  be  total  uniformity,
because, in any event, there are different circumstances to be addressed  by
different governments.

On this issue I must  say  that  in  1996  we  established  Mastech  in  the
province, which was an institution for maths, science and  technology,  and,
as a government, we gave the best students free  bursaries.  We  went  about
getting all the resources, and I can tell hon  members  we  concentrated  on
producing maths, science and technology  teachers.  That  is  what  we  were
doing. That programme, again, in terms of  the  strict  application  of  the
Constitution, was wrested away from us and handed over to the University  of
the North. I can tell hon members that it is now crawling. Limpopo  is  left
without skilled maths, science and technology teachers. So the  question  is
not who has what power, but who does what best, is capable of doing it,  and
has the vision, understanding and commmitment.

The other issue I want to raise is that  we  are  not  seeking  to  urbanise
Limpopo, but to enhance the quality of life of  our  rural  people  wherever
they are. In this regard, there is the question of policy that  we  need  to
look at. One cannot have a uniform policy for the  whole  country  which  is
not differentiated with respect to  application.  What  the  people  in  the
rural areas want in order to  enhance  their  quality  of  life  are  water,
electricity and roads. That is what they will tell one if one  goes  to  the
villages. In an effort to meet these needs, one finds  that  we  started  by
building in a township like Minga, which is away from the villages that  are
established. In other words, one is not putting resources  where  there  are
no resources. One can have a village that is established, but  it  does  not
have water. One goes on to put water somewhere and build  new  houses.  What
we thought we should do was to shift policy and  build  whatever  houses  we
could within the  established  households,  because  in  any  event  in  the
villages one does not have only one house in a yard. So  if  one  puts  more
houses in the yard, one is then able to  begin  to  connect  water  and  get
maximum outcome from one activity, rather than dispersing  one's  resources,
as we have been doing in the past.

I was going to tell members a story about some of  these  townships  in  the
villages, but I will leave that for another day, because I am  afraid  I  do
not have enough time left. All I can say is that they are, in the main,  not
occupied. One is likely to find that it is only the young people  who  apply
to go into those houses. They are newly married and so on.  The  husband  is
likely to be working elsewhere, so the village might  actually  be  occupied
only by women. When a man enters that village, everybody  runs  to  the  in-
laws and says: ``Have you seen a man going into that village?''  [Laughter.]
The husbands hear about this and then take their wives out of those  houses,
so they remain empty. One then finds that one is  not  using  the  resources
properly.

In other words, sustainable development must  also  take  into  account  the
customs and practices of our  people.  If  we  divorce  ourselves  from  the
custom which one has in  a  village  homestead  of  several  people  staying
together supporting one another and then wrenching some people out  of  this
arrangement without really taking into account this custom,  one  is  likely
to fail with that sort of approach in the rural areas.

I would first like  to  express  my  appreciation  for  the  fact  that  the
national Government has begun to deliver on  the  issue  of  processing  the
land claims. However, I want to urge that move to go  much  faster  because,
in the first instance, the claimants themselves are waiting in hope, and  we
need to make sure that we settle this issue.  In  the  second  instance,  we
need to establish certainty within the rural environment,  because  what  is
happening is that once land has been earmarked for land claims,  development
stops on that land. The farmer does not put money  into  something  that  he
cannot keep tomorrow. Jobs are lost and the land becomes less developed.  It
loses its value because care for the land stops. So we need to move fast  to
solve this problem.

Still on the subject of farming, members will be aware that there is  a  lot
of movement from cattle farming and even grain or crop  farming,  to  animal
farming in some provinces, ours being an example. Now what is  happening  is
that conflict is emerging between the cattle farmers and the  game  farmers,
because the game farmers are introducing ... Oh, I see my  time  is  running
out.

Let me just finish this point as it is very important. They are  introducing
buffalo which suffer from what they call  ``snotsiekte''  [bovine  malignant
catarrhal fever]. Once a cow catches ``snotsiekte'', one has to destroy  the
whole herd. What we are suggesting is  that  Onderstepoort  investigate  the
possibility of developing vaccine so that we can deal  with  ``snotsiekte''.
[Applause.]
Mr M M MAMASE (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, Deputy  President,  hon  Premiers
and hon members of this House, as we  return  to  relevance  and  the  first
principles of planning, sustainable development is  development  that  takes
care of the needs of the present generation without compromising  the  needs
of future generations.

Sustainable development  encompasses  several  pillars,  including  economic
development, social acceptability, rates management,  resource  productivity
and environmental concerns, as they are scheduled to  be  discussed  at  the
World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.

The strongest pillar of sustainable development is capital development.  The
other pillars are, by their very nature, passive agents of  development.  It
is the people, or the human capital, that are active agents  of  development
and  change.  People  take  decisions,  make  choices  from  the   available
alternatives and combine the available resources, or factors of  production,
in order to satisfy their needs and sometimes their wants. For  these  needs
to be satisfied, a conducive environment in the form  of  enabling  policies
has to be created, whereby people are able to make  choices  and  decisions,
and take responsibility for their lives.
Skills development comes before structural development.  We  have  witnessed
the destruction of the environment and vandalism, which  are  not  good  for
the future welfare of the people, owing to the  slow  development  of  human
resources in this country.

Women should be at the forefront of development, and  for  them  to  have  a
significant impact they  need  education,  intellectual  skills,  moral  and
spiritual  support,  and  be  fortified   with   strength   and   character.
Sustainable development relies on  both  the  men  and  the  women  of  this
country, who are the distinct two sides of the same coin  as  their  efforts
can never be separated.

For  us  to  achieve  our  objectives  in  sustainable   urban   and   rural
development, our strategies should incorporate  a  very  strong  element  of
women empowerment as a priority. This  is  the  determining  factor  of  how
integrated our urban and rural development strategies are. If  we  do  this,
we will be able to attain socially  cohesive  and  stable  urban  and  rural
communities, viable institutions and sustainable economies.

Corrosive  poverty  has  also  got  national  attention,  and  the   current
functions, as  reflected  in  the  Constitution,  are  becoming  a  reality.
Therefore, women need recognition in all spheres of  existing  institutions,
not just by their  presence  and  visibility.  They  need  to  have  clearly
defined roles, whether political, social  or  otherwise.  For  women  to  be
fully empowered, they have to be  involved  in  policy  and  decision-making
structures at all levels and at all times. If we do this,  our  institutions
will become viable and stable.

Rural development in the form of ham  production  and  sugar  production  is
progressing in the Eastern Cape, and women have  taken  and  occupied  their
rightful  place  in  these   projects.   The   Constitution   provides   for
interdependence and interrelations in respect of competencies, policies  and
lawmaking.  The  key  guiding  principle  of  co-operative  governance   and
intergovernance are based on consultation on  matters  of  common  interest,
legislation, and on the avoidance of legal procedures against one another.

Rural  development,   in   our   view   ...   mhlalingaphambili,   uphuhliso
emaphandleni luya kuthi ukuze lukwazi ukuqhubeka ngolu hlobo  esifuna  ngalo
sibandakanye ... [... Chairperson, in order for development  to  take  place
the way we want it, we should involve ...  ]  it  involves  both  black  and
white commercial farmers in what we called a  mentorship  programme  in  the
province. This mentorship programme has resulted in a number of areas.

Uboya begusha kweliya phondo, abantu abasezilalini  babuthengisa  naphesheya
namhlanje. Iitapile ziyaveliswa kweliya Phondo.  Siza  kutyisa  abaya  bantu
baseRhawutini. Amapayina siza kuwasa  eMalaysia.  (Translation  of  isiXhosa
paragraph follows.)

[People in rural areas sell their sheep's wool overseas  nowadays.  Potatoes
are being produced in that province. We are even going to supply  people  in
Gauteng. We are going to take our pineapple produce to Malaysia.]

The only terrain in which we  are  still  struggling,  is  that  of  cattle-
farming, but, "ndifuna ukuthi, Mhlalingaphambili" ... [Chairperson, I  would
like to inform people ... ] for the last three years ... "le mbasa  yeFemale
Farmer of the Year ithatyathwa leliya phondo minyaka le.  Ithi  ke  loo  nto
oomama banendima  enkulu  abayidlalayo.  Ndiphinde  ndithi  ...  ["that  the
Female Farmer of the Year Award has been won by somebody from that  province
every year.  That  shows  the  importance  of  the  role  that  women  play.
Furthermore, I would like to say that ... "]

It is, therefore,  necessary  for  all  of  us  to  exploit  the  structural
arrangement of governance to empower the women of our country.  We  need  to
emphasise human capital development in order for the  women  to  occupy  key
strategic decision-making positions in our country.

The theatre of action, in terms of service  delivery,  in  urban  and  rural
areas at local government level has been seen as the key  dynamic  in  power
relations at local government level. This is  the  most  crucial  sphere  of
government, owing to its proximity to the people, women, men,  children  and
the disabled. This means, therefore, that as  we  continue  to  devolve  and
decentralise  powers,  functions   and   resources   to   local   government
structures, this should be coupled with the  devolution  of  human  resource
personnel,  who  are  adequately  equipped  with  the  relevant  skills  and
expertise to speed up service delivery.

Tomorrow, as we celebrate Women's Day, we will also be laying  to  rest  the
remains of Saartjie Baartman. This symbolises the era from which we come.
Despite the bombardment by all the newspapers  in  our  country  as  far  as
education, social welfare and health are concerned,  we  continue  with  our
vigilance to better the lives of our people.

The Nqura development and the East London industrial  development  zone  are
taking shape and continue to be  sources  of  employment  in  our  province.
Concurrent competencies are being deepened, and in  the  rural  areas  rural
development  and  sustainable  development   are   constantly   on   course.
[Applause.]

Ms M  P  THEMBA:  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon  premiers,  hon
members, we have heard about the beautiful things, the programmes, that  are
taking place in all our provinces. The next thing  that  we  would  like  to
hear about are the monitoring structures  that  are  in  place  in  all  our
different provinces, for example the offices on the status of women  in  the
premiers' offices - the gender focal point in all the departments - so  that
we may be able to interact with the relevant structures.

Tomorrow we  will  be  celebrating  our  day,  Women's  Day,  the  day  that
signifies the important role our women have played in  our  democracy.  They
left behind their aprons and took up arms, saying: ``We cannot  stand  aside
and do nothing when our rights are being abused, when human rights  have  no
meaning in the country of our forefathers, when apartheid is destroying  the
core of the soul of our people.''

Tomorrow we will be celebrating the power of  women.  As  the  saying  goes:
``Wathint'umfazi wathint'imbhokodo'' [For we are the rocks  and  the  anchor
of our nation.]

I am sure, hon Chairperson, you will agree with me when I say that no  words
can ever explain the importance of the role of women in our society  -  from
being the ones who give birth to nations to being the ones  who  mother  the
nations.

Phela, ngibo bomake  labangubona  batsatsa  litjalo  balibophe  elukhalweni.
[Indeed, it is the mothers who take full responsibility by fastening  shawls
around their waists.] Ke bona bomme ba ba tshwarang thipa  ka  fa  bogaleng.
[Those are the mothers who stand up for their children.]

Therefore, in any democracy the role of women cannot  be  underestimated  or
undermined. I  would  like  to  quote  from  research  done  by  the  Inter-
parliamentary Union entitled Politics: Women's Insight:


  Democracy is participation. By their  participation,  women  broaden  the
  democratic arena. If women are not present in politics and  at  decision-
  making levels, there is no democracy.  Decisions  taken  without  women's
  perspectives lack credibility in a democratic context.

Unfortunately,  history  has  shown  the  contrary.  We  have  read  in  our
newspapers and seen from our own experiences in our country the  degradation
of women's abilities, the undermining of their  intellectual  capacity,  not
to mention the abuse of women and children. As a nation we have come a  long
way in terms of gender empowerment, and yet our journey has just begun.

As we all know, transformation is a long walk on its own, but as  a  winning
nation we are determined to combat  the  abuse  of  women  and  promote  the
empowerment of women. We need more women behind legislation so that we  can,
indeed, practice what we preach and see to it that laws that  protect  women
are implemented. In that way, equality,  as  the  foundation  of  democracy,
will move from law to being practice in order to guarantee freedom for  all,
thereby making us proud to all call our nation a true democracy.

Our Constitution embraces gender equality and  the  progressive  realisation
of basic social rights, such as access to education, housing and health  for
women. It protects women's rights  to  control  their  bodies  and  it  also
includes freedom from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

This has  led  to  numerous  sectoral  policies  and  legislation  aimed  at
transforming the social delivery system and at the reprioritisation  of  our
national budget, with a deliberate bias in favour of the social  sector.  In
co-operation with  civil  society,  the  Government  has  implemented  major
reforms providing broader access  for  women  to  education  and  illiteracy
programmes, to improved reproductive health  services,  poverty  eradication
policies, and national strategies to combat domestic violence.

Through its Department of  Trade  and  Industry,  Government  has  developed
various  support  mechanisms  and  initiatives  to  support  and  strengthen
women's enterprises. Technology for Women in  Business,  Twib,  and  the  SA
Women Entrepreneur Network, Sawen, are two major  projects  targeting  women
specifically in business.

The Department of Trade and Industry also has a separate gender  unit  which
is  mandated  to  implement   gender   capacity-building   programmes   that
specifically target women and business skills. In this  respect,  the  focus
is on rural women.

We held a national gender summit last  year.  The  idea  of  having  such  a
summit was seen as mutually beneficial for the newly established  structures
constituting the core of the national gender machinery. The purpose of  this
summit was to bring together key national stakeholders and  a  few  regional
stakeholders in the field of gender equality in order to provide a  platform
for stakeholders to engage,  assess  progress  and  redefine  the  strategic
direction for the national gender machinery.

The resolutions of the summit were about, amongst other things,  reinstating
gender budgeting in planning, policy  and  implementation;  sexual  offences
laws; the UIF meeting  the  needs  of  women  workers,  especially  domestic
workers; and holding hearings on how  South  Africa  can  best  address  the
impact of HIV and Aids on women.

The Office  on  the  Status  of  Women  committed  itself  to  developing  a
comprehensive national gender action plan that would activate the  principle
of South Africa's national policy  framework  for  women's  empowerment  and
gender equality in which women and poverty, HIV/Aids, rural strategy,  women
and the economy, and violence against women will be priorities.

In addition, the Commission on Gender Equality, the Office on the Status  of
Women and the parliamentary Joint Monitoring Committee  on  the  Improvement
of Quality of Life and Status of Women will have the  complementary  mandate
of promoting and protecting gender equality.

To conclude, the challenges we are facing as a nation in terms of women  are
mere challenges and not  obstacles.  They  are  challenges  that  come  with
transformation, with more women taking charge and being the drivers  of  and
pioneers in the empowerment of women,  and  with  their  playing  a  crucial
proactive role in the legislation. Siyawunqoba. [We will win the battle.]
We must take our democracy to the next level, and indeed the  objectives  of
an African Union and those of Nepad will be realised. Indeed,  this  century
will be ours, for these objectives cannot be realised without the  proactive
participation of women.

On that note, I would like to congratulate the Government of the  people  on
its effort and the role it has played in ensuring that  women's  rights  are
indeed realised.

Ngifisela bomake  bonkhe  imicimbi  lemnandzi  kusasa.  Igama  lamakhosikazi
alibongwe! [Tandla.] [I wish all mothers a successful celebration  tomorrow.
Let the voice of women be praised! [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Chairperson, premiers, MECs  and  all  delegates
of the NCOP, you will agree that we  have  taken  up  the  entire  afternoon
debating. If I were to respond to specific inputs that have  been  made,  we
will sit  here  until  tomorrow.  [Laughter.]  The  inputs  have  been  very
enriching and wide-ranging, touching on all the key issues  that  needed  to
be touched on by this House. I would, therefore, like to take a few  minutes
to really express my  gratitude  and  also  to  acknowledge  the  input  and
contributions that have been made by the  members.  They  have  indeed  been
inspiring.

With regard to provinces, premiers  and  representatives  of  premiers  have
indicated the kind of development and progress that is being made.  I  think
that almost every province had an opportunity to  indicate  to  us  what  is
happening in a number of areas. This has indeed  been  encouraging,  as  has
been the determination shown  by  premiers  to  continue  to  implement  the
programmes. I think that if I were to go through  each  province,  again,  I
could take a lot of time. I must say that it has been encouraging.

The contributions covered a number of areas. An area that has  been  covered
is the area of health. The issue of HIV/Aids was almost always  out  and,  I
think, very correctly so, given the challenge that it  has  given  us  as  a
nation. I think all of us are  agreed  that  this  issue  needs  our  almost
undivided attention in order for us to deal with it. We should look at  this
issue as a challenge, rather than as an issue with which to  play  politics.
I think that if we can succeed in putting  our  thoughts  together  on  this
issue, we would have done this country a lot of good.
The Premier of the Western Cape, in dealing with this issue, remembered  the
statement made by the Cabinet on 17  April.  Given  the  controversies  that
have come with the process, he was keen  to  check  whether  the  Government
still reaffirms that  position.  Certainly,  we  reaffirm  that  position  -
Government's stance on that - and it has not changed. We  will  continue  to
take that stance. We believe that is  an  issue  we  all  need  to  pay  our
attention to as much as possible. It is a complicated  issue,  an  issue  of
life and death. It is a very emotional issue. So in politics we  should  not
use such an issue in a manner  that  does  not  promote  help  in  terms  of
seeking solutions, as it is an issue which really touches our lives.

There were other things that were raised on the question of the  broad  area
of health which, I  think,  indicated  the  attention  which  provinces  are
paying to this issue. I was also happy that some explanations were given  of
the Global Fund in the process of  contributions,  Dr  Zweli  Mkhize  having
discussed it. I hope that we can look at how we benefit  from  this,  rather
than seeing it as an issue on which to score points.

The issue of poverty and our determination to deal with it  were  raised  by
almost everyone. I am certain that all  programmes  of  Government,  in  all
spheres of government, are in the main aimed at  dealing  with  poverty  and
underdevelopment. One is encouraged, indeed, to  see  the  sensitivity  with
which we have dealt with that.

We have also dealt with  the  question  of  economic  development  from  the
different angles of the provinces. The  Premier  of  Limpopo  province  took
time to give details and examples of how they have tried to  deal  with  the
most  difficult  aspect  of  rural  areas  in  terms   of   bringing   about
development. I am sure that  it  would  be  very  interesting  if  we  could
perhaps have an indaba about rural development as an issue that needs to  be
attended to very specifically, because I believe that it  is  only  when  we
succeed in bringing about development in the rural areas  that  we  will  in
fact have delivered a telling blow to poverty. This  would  be  particularly
so if it could be  in  support  of  rural  development  as  a  programme  of
Government. It is correct that although, in general  terms,  areas  will  be
the same,  there  will  be  peculiarities  that  might  need  very  specific
attention.  I  think  that,  in  this  regard,  colleagues   discussed   all
Government programmes, including rural and urban development.

I must note, as well, the point made, firstly, by  the  Premier  of  Gauteng
and by other premiers regarding the question of the delay of funds from  the
national sphere to projects to which money has been allocated. I think  that
is an issue that needs to be addressed. I do  believe  that  the  manner  in
which we handle finances, or the flow of finances, does need  to  be  looked
at because at times the systems - correct and important as  they  are  -  if
dealt with in a particular way, would actually tend to undermine their  very
objective.

We do need to discuss that issue at a given time because one could  ask  how
we can get the moneys quickly  enough  and  how  we  commit  the  moneys.  I
remember dealing with this issue while I  was  still  in  the  province.  We
still had what was called the RDP Fund.  Once  the  announcement  was  made,
they thought that the money was in the province. As one  walked  around  one
could hear them  say:  "Bayayidla  imali  yethu  laba."  [These  people  are
pocketing our money.] I had to explain and I used  the  peasant  analogy  or
explanation.

Ngangiye ngithi, hhayi, ayikho le nto. Iyinto efana  nokuthola  imbuzi  noma
inkomo ukuze uyifuye. Isuke ise  le  kude  futhi  isashaywe  uphawu  lokuthi
ngeyalapha   ekhaya   nje   kuphela.   Kodwa   isuke   ingakazaleli    futhi
ingakasengelwa lapha ekhaya.  Izalela  le  isengwe  le  esibayeni  esikhulu.
(Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[I used to say that it was not true. It was like getting a goat or a cow  to
keep, but it has not yet come to your home.  It  is  still  there,  at  your
father's place - the main kraal - and the only  thing  that  shows  that  it
belongs to you is the mark on it. But it has not given you a calf  or  milk.
It has given birth to a calf there, and it is being milked there  -  at  the
main kraal.]

I am sure this is an issue that we need to address, not  with  any  conflict
but as an issue to  help  us  speed  up  delivery.  I  think  that  is  very
important. This might address the issue of the moneys  that,  at  times,  do
not get utilised. I have noticed that at times people  rush  around  to  use
the money quickly because the time has come.  So  maybe  what  becomes  more
important is the balancing of the books, rather than delivery.  That  is  an
issue that needs to be discussed. I am happy that the premiers  have  raised
it. I do not think that they raised it as a criticism, but as an issue  that
needs to be addressed in order to find  a  way  to  deal  with  it.  I  will
certainly convey this message to the national Government.

Issues were raised about the World Summit on Sustainable Development.  I  am
sure there is not much one can say in that regard, except that  it  is  true
that the approach by developed countries and by us on a number of issues  is
an issue that all of us need to address. Among other things is the issue  of
the environment, which was touched upon here. For a developed  country,  the
major emphasis is: ``Do not touch the environment;  do  not  interfere  with
the environment'', whilst  they  have  gone  through  a  number  of  stages,
including damaging the environment.

The problem  that  we  need  to  deal  with  from  the  perspective  of  the
developing world is: What does one do if one has  a  beautiful  environment,
part of might even be declared a world heritage site, but adjacent to it  is
a very poor community? How does one balance those two?  To  me,  that  is  a
critical issue that the summit needs to deal with.

I have in mind a community in  KwaZulu-Natal  where  there  is  one  of  the
outstanding wetlands areas of St Lucia. But this area is  described  as  the
worst poverty-stricken area. How does one balance those  two?  How  can  one
sit with beautiful nature and  not  touch  it  while  people  are  dying  of
starvation? This is something we  need  to  balance  because  it  becomes  a
contradiction in terms. How does one balance the  two  and,  therefore,  how
does one balance environment with the  people  who  have  to  live  on  this
planet? This is an issue which, in my view,  the  developed  and  developing
world need to discuss in order to find a balance because it is easy to  find
a balance.

I am happy that the issue of Nepad has been raised.  I  feel  very  strongly
about it because I think, as the speakers have indicated, it  is  the  first
time that Africa has  a  plan  for  Africa  by  Africans,  almost  like  the
Marshall Plan after the Second World War. We are not begging for money  with
it. Rather we are making partnerships amongst ourselves and  saying  to  the
world: ``Partner with us on an equal level''. I think this is  an  important
programme that we have to look  at  in  terms  of  its  bigger  and  smaller
aspects and decide how we can implement it.

The Premier of the Northern Cape raised the issue of rail  transport,  among
other things. That is an issue which I could feel everybody  was  agreed  on
in the House. This is something that the Minister of  Transport  is  dealing
with. The question is how we can move faster on rail transport,  because  we
cannot call ourselves a developed country on the continent when  we  do  not
utilise transport in the  manner  in  which  it  is  utilised  in  developed
countries. Developed countries have tube trains that run underground.

Izitimela zakhona  zihamba  ngaphansi  komhlaba  lapho  kuthi  uma  usuhamba
ngaphansi komhlaba ucabange  ukuthi  usufike  kwabakini  asebakushiya  kanti
lutho, kuseyinto yentuthuko nje. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[Developed countries' trains move underground. When one is underground,  one
may think that one has come to the world of one's forefathers. But  that  is
not it; it is just the level of development.]

It is important for us to look into that in  a  very  concentrated  fashion.
The plan is there, and I think that the Minister is working on it. It  is  a
question of how we support that so  that  it  becomes  a  reality  regarding
employment and transportation.

Regarding the lack of capacity in Salga, as Cllr Mlaba said, I think  it  is
serious if Salga complains that they have less capacity. I would  understand
if it was a district somewhere in the bundu, not a metro like Durban,  which
would cry to us that there is no capacity when we are told  that  they  have
enough money. It is really a question of planning and also  of  appreciating
their participation here and in other structures. It is important that  they
should budget for that.

Regarding the question of budgeting, metros, in  my  view,  must  carry  the
poor ones. I do not think that we could do  otherwise.  It  is  an  issue  I
would imagine the NCOP should look at, because it looks like  an  artificial
issue. I am not saying that other structures at  the  lower  levels  do  not
have problems, but this cannot be a general problem. I  do  not  think  that
the Johannesburg or Cape Town metros complain. I  do  not  think  that  they
cannot help, because here we are not saying  that  everybody  comes  at  the
same time. Representatives have to be identified so that they can  be  in  a
position to participate. So I think that we need to do something about it.

Regarding what Kgoshi said about  pushing  an  elephant,  I  would  like  to
respond because a few weeks ago we were here in  Cape  Town  to  launch  the
National House of Traditional Leaders. I observed very  wonderful  relations
between the Minister and amakhosi.  There  were  statements  made  that  the
matters were being resolved. So I hope that the elephant is now  walking  on
its own. [Laughter.]

An issue  was  raised  about  the  implementation  of  policy  in  terms  of
different conditions in different provinces which, I think, we need to  take
into account, as we do a number  of  things.  Peace  and  stability  in  our
country, on our continent and in the world is, I think, what we  all  strive
for and what we should try to work for. It is important to do so.  The  time
of war is over. Even Europe, whose history has just  been  about  wars,  has
stopped fighting. They  are  now  doing  development  and  coming  together,
uniting. It would be very useful if we could do so.

I also note the point raised by Premier Van Schalkwyk on the  issue  of  the
politicians who are using the  Afrikaners  for  some  narrow  objectives.  I
believe that that issue is very important and should  be  handled  with  the
greatest care because, at times, people or politicians become too  emotional
about it. I have always had  a  problem  with  politics  that  is  based  on
ethnicity. It does not have a future.

Politics must be broad enough to be based on how society  can  move  forward
and on how we interpret society. Of course it should take into  account  the
realities. But once politics becomes based on ethnicity - and  that  becomes
the beginning and the end -  it  becomes  too  dangerous.  I  think  Mr  van
Schalkwyk is correct, therefore, to say that some people are utilising  this
for very narrow ends. I hope that South Africans would realise by  now  that
that does not take anybody very far.

Just like the politics of opposition, there is a  misunderstanding  of  what
opposition is. People believe that to be in  the  opposition  is  to  oppose
everything. [Interjections.] If one stands up one must  say  something  just
to oppose. I do not think that is opposition.  It  is  something  else.  One
cannot forget what the broader interests of the people are  and  one  cannot
fail to distinguish between what is good that is being  done,  and  what  is
not good. That is particularly so in a country where  one  would  know  that
one would not win government in one's lifetime. One then has  to  ask:  What
can I do to help so that the conditions of the people can be  addressed  and
I become a constructive opposition?

It is one thing if people think that the gap is  too  narrow  in  that  they
think they can win and therefore use other methods, but it is another  thing
when one knows that one will never win in one's lifetime,  or  even  in  the
lifetime of the generations to come. So  one  has  to  be  constructive  and
place the interests of the country above the party. Therefore, by  being  in
opposition one must be helpful to the people.

I totally agree with Mr van Schalkwyk that  the  politics  must  change.  We
must have politics of building the nation, ie the politics that always  seek
to unite our people because they need to  be  united.  I  think  it  is  not
correct for politicians to spend time,  energy  and  money  working  towards
dividing people.  It  cannot  be  right.  If  people  have  those  kinds  of
political beliefs - I am  sure  people  can  have  all  kinds  of  political
beliefs, but wars have started because  of  the  wrong  beliefs  -  that  is
actually wrong. It cannot be right.

I am happy, therefore, that a member very  strongly  and  quite  emotionally
stressed the point that we needed to work together. I was  very  happy  with
that contribution because it helps the country. It makes  the  country  feel
comfortable. If we dissolve tension, even if we do not  have  everything,  I
am sure that this country will move towards prosperity very fast. It is  the
duty of every politician to do so. We should try our best  to  talk  to  our
colleagues who believe otherwise. If need be, we should teach them a bit  of
politics. [Interjections.]

I was also happy that we talked a great deal about tomorrow -  the  big  day
for women. It would  be  important,  therefore,  to  end  on  that  note  by
thanking everyone who participated. Also to you, Chairperson, I  would  like
to say that this debate was properly placed in that it  took  place  just  a
day before 9 August. We have made a contribution as a country  by  attending
to the issue of the empowerment of women. We have actually become  a  leader
in the world. Everybody looks towards South Africa. I can guarantee  members
that some of our women who participate in international organisations  have,
indeed, done us proud. They have made an effective  contribution.  Everybody
believes today that women in this country  who  are  in  positions  are  not
there because they are tokens, but because of merit. They are making a  huge
contribution. They argue on matters in the  world  that  anyone  would  find
very difficult if  they  did  not  have  the  correct  points.  That  is  an
important thing.

I would like to appeal to them because they  have  a  way  of  dealing  with
issues. In a Zulu setting, if a man is  really  fighting  and  fighting  and
cannot be stopped by anyone, even his brothers cannot stop  him,  one  needs
to call a wife to come to stop him. The wife comes carrying a baby, with  no
stick at all, and asks: ``Yise kabani, wenzani?'' [So-and-so's father,  what
are you doing?] Then one will see the man go  back  and  say  ``Ngiyokuthola
kusasa.'' [I will get you tomorrow.] [Laughter.] The mother  has  spoken.  I
think that they should participate in the process of diffusing  tensions  in
the country and of bringing about unity.

They need to participate and focus on this  because  the  country  can  hear
them better. At times it is worrying when one hears politicians, when  faced
with political differences, talking in a  manner  that  does  not  help  the
country. We can talk. If we fail, we have the Constitution and we can go  to
court. Why should we then get angry? It does not help. I hope  they  can  do
that. [Interjections.] Yes, that member heard. I  am  sure  the  mother  was
talking. In Zulu they say:  "Wathinta  abafazi,  wathinta  imbokodo!''  [You
have touched women, you have touched the rock!]

Empa ha re bua  Sesotho  re  re,  `Mosadi  o  tshwara  thipa  ka  bohaleng'.
[Ditlatse.] [A real mother is the one who protects her  children  under  any
circumstances.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
