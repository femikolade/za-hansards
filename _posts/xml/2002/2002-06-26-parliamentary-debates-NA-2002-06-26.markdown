                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms T R MODISE: Chairperson, I hereby  give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that today marks the 47th anniversary of the  adoption  of  the
       Freedom Charter on 26 June 1955 by the Congress of the People held at
       Kliptown;


  (2) believes that South Africa belongs to all who live in it,  black  and
       white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is
       based on the will of all the people;


  (3) further believes that our country will never be  prosperous  or  free
       until all our people live in  brotherhood  and  sisterhood,  enjoying
       equal rights and opportunities;


  (4) pledges that it will strive together, sparing  neither  strength  nor
       courage, until the democratic changes set out in the Freedom  Charter
       have been won; and


  (5) further pledges: ``These freedoms we shall fight for, side  by  side,
       throughout our lives, until we have won our liberty.''

[Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf  of
the DP on the next sitting day:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the heavy-handed action by the Johannesburg Metro  Council  and
       the  police  in  their  efforts  to  forcibly  remove  the   informal
       settlement of Thembelihle near Lenasia yesterday;


  (2) further notes the injury to nine residents from rubber bullets;


  (3) regrets the  apartheid-style  tactics  of  the  ANC-run  Johannesburg
       Council which is removing people at the height of winter;


  (4) deprecates the fact that the ANC seems incapable, unwilling or unable
       to conduct effective negotiations with the residents  or  to  provide
       them with alternative accommodation; and
  (5) urges them to  redouble  their  efforts  to  resolve  the  residents'
       concerns about access to schools and jobs.

Dr O S B BALOYI: Chairperson, I shall move  at  the  next  sitting  of  this
House on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with appreciation -


       (a)  the initiative taken by the Treatment Action Campaign to hold  a
           three-day   conference   involving   themselves,   Cosatu    and
           representatives  from  the  relevant  section  of  the  national
           Department of Health; and


       (b)  that the implementation of antiretroviral treatment, linking  TB
           and  HIV  care  and  bridging  the  gap  between  NGOs  and  the
           Government, are subjects for discussion at this conference; and


  (2) wishes this initiative success and trusts that after this  conference
       opportunities will be created for all political parties and all civil
       society  structures  to  play  a  meaningful  role  in   facilitating
       efficient and effective rollout of the treatment with antiretrovirals
       throughout the length and breadth of South Africa.

Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Freedom Charter states: ``The people  shall  share  in
       the country's wealth'' and ``The national wealth of our country,  the
       heritage of South Africans, shall be restored to the people'';


  (2) further notes that a broad coalition of black business, trade  unions
       and political parties has come out in  support  of  the  Mineral  and
       Petroleum Resources Development Bill;
  (3) believes that this Bill will facilitate the inclusion and empowerment
       of historically disadvantaged communities to play an active  role  in
       the mining industry and will improve the quality of life  of  workers
       and the community;


  (4) further believes that this Bill  will  facilitate  investment  in  an
       industry whose monopoly structure deterred  such  investment  in  the
       past; and


  (5) congratulates the Minister of Minerals and Energy, the  hon  Phumzile
       Mlambo-Ngcuka, for spearheading legislation that will  contribute  to
       the fundamental  transformation  of  our  economy,  moving  back  the
       frontiers of poverty and building a better life for all.

[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Mr Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move on  behalf  of
the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock the death of five young boys and the hospitalisation
       of another 51 boys as a result of initiation rites in Gauteng;


  (2) further notes that the boys died because of exposure to cold  weather
       conditions,  severe  beatings  and  unhygienic   and   unprofessional
       circumcisions;


  (3) also takes note that, although the New NP fully respects the  culture
       of initiation, we are concerned that these  practices  violate  human
       rights and cause the deaths of many young boys;


  (4) calls on -


       (a)  all provincial and local governments  to  institute  legislation
           which  compels  traditional  healers  to   register   with   the
           Department  of  Health  before  they   are   able   to   perform
           circumcisions; and
       (b)   the  national  House  of  Traditional  Leaders  to  assist  the
           Government in making these practices safer; and


  (5) declares that we certainly cannot afford to lose  so  many  of  South
       Africa's young boys.

[Applause.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Hon Chairperson, I will move on behalf of  the  UDM  at
the next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 26 June is annually observed as the UN  International  Day
       against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking, and is in line  with
       the UN General Assembly  resolution  to  strengthen  action  and  co-
       operation to achieve an international society free of drug abuse;


  (2) expresses its  outrage  at  the  Government's  continued  failure  to
       develop an integrated strategy to fight the intertwined  problems  of
       drug abuse/trafficking and gangsterism and organised crime;


  (3) notes that the Government  is  failing  to  protect  the  vulnerable,
       especially the poor and the youth,  who  are  exploited  by  ruthless
       gangsters as distributors of and a market for illicit drugs; and


  (4) once  again  urges  Government  to  develop  a  holistic,  integrated
       strategy involving all three spheres of  government,  to  combat  the
       intertwined problems  of  drug  abuse  and  trafficking  as  well  as
       gangsterism and organised crime.

Mrs Z A KOTA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Freedom Charter declares:  ``There  shall  be  houses,
       security and comfort'' and ``All people shall have the right to  live
       where they choose, be decently housed, and to bring up their families
       in comfort and security'' and also: ``Fenced locations  and  ghettoes
       shall be abolished'';


  (2) notes with concern that the DA in the Cape Town Metropolitan  Council
       intends erecting a wall separating poor black  residents  from  their
       affluent white counterparts in Wallacedene;


  (3) believes that this reflects the commitment of the DA to  protect  the
       privileges of a wealthy minority;


  (4) believes that this wall undermines the building of unity amongst  our
       people and will lead to racial polarisation; and


  (5) rejects this plan by the DA to divide the  community  of  Wallacedene
       along racial lines and calls on the DA to halt its racist plan.

[Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a preparatory meeting for the first launch of the AU is meeting
           in Durban;


       (b)  the AU is driven by an executive with little popular
           participation so far; and


       (c)  one of the organs of the AU is the Pan African Parliament; and


  (2) calls upon the preparatory meeting in Durban to put the early launch
       of the PAP on the agenda of the assembly of the AU in order to
       expedite popular participation in the affairs of the AU.

       Julie te Stevenage naby Londen sal plaasvind;


  (2) verder kennis neem dat dit vanjaar die tweede keer sal wees dat

       werksaam is, weer eens hierdie fees in groot getalle sal bywoon om
       sodoende Afrikaanse kuns en kultuur op sy beste te ervaar en te
       koester; en


  (4) die organiseerders en deelnemers aan die fees alle voorspoed en
       sterkte toewens, en sy hoop uitspreek dat die Ukkasie Kunstefees van
       krag tot krag sal gaan.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the KWV Ukkasie Arts Festival will be taking place at
       Stevenage near London from 19 to 21 July;


  (2) further notes that this is the second time this arts festival is to
       be presented in London and that various well-known Afrikaans artists
       will be appearing at this festival;

       in London will once again attend this festival in large numbers so as
       to experience and cherish Afrikaans art and culture at its best; and

       expresses the hope that  the  Ukkasie  Arts  Festival  will  go  from
       strength to strength.]

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Chairperson, I hereby  give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that today marks the 50th anniversary of the Defiance Campaign
       launched on 26 June 1952;


  (2) further notes that thousands of South Africans, black and white,
       volunteered to defy unjust and oppressive apartheid laws;


  (3) believes that the role played by these volunteers contributed
       decisively to the overthrow of apartheid colonialism and to the
       creation of a nonracial, nonsexist and democratic South Africa;


  (4) commends the vision, commitment, courage and dedication displayed by
       these patriotic volunteers; and


  (5) calls upon all South Africans to display the same spirit and to
       answer to President Thabo Mbeki's call of Vukuzenzele, so that all
       South Africans become partners in realising the ideals of the Freedom
       Charter.

[Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with alarm reports that the illegal collection of perlemoen
       could be as high as 30 times the legal harvest;


  (2) further notes that this is unsustainable and threatens one of our
       most valuable marine resources;


  (3) regrets that this unsustainable poaching is carried out with apparent
       impunity in a country which is about to host the World Summit on
       Sustainable Development; and


  (4) endorses the DA's call to the Minister of Environmental Affairs and
       Tourism and the Minister of Safety and Security to work together as a
       matter of great urgency to put an end to this evil.

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of Parliament:


  That the House -


  (1) appreciates Eskom's restructuring of its business and
       reprioritisation of the needs of its customers in order of affluence
       and poverty status, reaffirming its commitment to working with other
       companies to improve economic conditions for all of Africa's
       citizens;


  (2) welcomes the stand taken by the Union of Electrical Energy Producers
       in Africa that power utilities were set to play a pivotal role in the
       provision of infrastructural development as an integral part of their
       contribution to Nepad;


  (3) recognises that the African Union's stand is in keeping with creating
       investor confidence in the economic development of the country and
       other neighbouring states who benefit from South Africa's electricity
       supply; and


  (4) calls on all stakeholders involved in the production and distribution
       of electrical energy to gird their loins and pull together for
       Africa's regeneration.

Dr Z P JORDAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the Freedom Charter declares that: ``South Africa shall be
           a fully independent state which respects the rights and
           sovereignty of all nations'';


       (b)  the long delay in the implementation of the UN Peace Plan for
           the Western Sahara, and the attempts to substitute the self-
           determination referendum with other solutions that do not
           recognise the legitimate rights of the Saharawi people; and


       (c)  that South Africa will host the African Union conference in July
           2002; and


  (2) calls on the UN to fulfil its mandate to decolonise the Western
       Sahara through a genuine, fair and complete self-determination and
       without further delay.
[Applause.]

Mnr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Mev die Speaker, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek
namens die Nuwe NP by die volgende sitting van die Huis sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis kennis neem -


  (1) van die kommerwekkende bevindings van 'n interne verslag van die
       Departement vir Staatsdiens en Administrasie wat op die volgende dui:


       (a)  byna 20% van Suid-Afrikaanse staatsamptenare sal teen 2005 MIV-
           positief wees; en


       (b)  Vigs sal die lewens van 253 000 staatswerkers teen 2012 eis as
           die departement nie die nodige voorsorg tref nie;


  (2) dat, indien hierdie bevindinge gaan realiseer, dit dienslewering
       reeds in 2005 sal lam lê;


  (3) dat die Nuwe NP glo dat dit absoluut noodsaaklik is dat die verslag
       die Departement vir Staatsdiens en Administrasie, maar ook alle ander
       departemente, tot proaktiewe optrede dwing en dat die nodige
       gebeurlikheidsplanne gereed moet wees, sodat departemente nie tot
       stilstand gebring sal word weens die impak van MIV/Vigs nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the
next sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House takes note -


  (1) of the alarming findings of an internal report of the Department for
       the Public Service and Administration which points to the following:


       (a)  nearly 20% of South African public servants will be HIV positive
           by the year 2005; and


       (b)  Aids will claim the lives of 253 000 public servants by 2012 if
           the department does not take the necessary precautions;


  (2) that, if these findings are going to be realised, it will paralyse
       service delivery already in 2005;


  (3) the NNP believes that it is absolutely essential that this report
       should force the department for the Public Service and Administration
       as well as all the other departments to proactive action and that the
       necessary contingency plans be put in place, so that departments are
       not brought to a standstill as a result of the impact of HIV/Aids.]
Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the UDM at the next
sitting of this House:


  That the House:


  (1) notes the report of the murder of a Malmesbury prison inmate who was
       found with his hands tied and a rope around his neck;


  (2) condemns the ironic comment by the Correctional Services prison
       officials who stated that they cannot rule out the possibility of
       suicide;


  (3) further notes this event highlights the seriousness of corruption and
       crime, as well as the evidence of racism and prejudice in the
       Department of Correctional Services heard before the Jali Commission;


  (4) expresses its concern that these are yet further examples that the
       Department of Correctional Services is dysfunctional and unable to
       fulfil its duty to properly incarcerate and rehabilitate prisoners;
       and


  (5) calls for an independent inquiry into the death of the Malmesbury
       prisoner, and further calls on the Minister of Correctional Services
       to urgently implement workable strategies to correct the
       dysfunctional state of his department.

[Applause.]

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 24 June marked the seven-year anniversary of South
       Africa's victory in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Tournament;
  (2) remembers the contribution that this victory made towards nation-
       building in South Africa; and


  (3) expresses its appreciation and gratitude to the Springboks, the
       Proteas, Bafana Bafana and all other sportsmen and -women who compete
       at the highest level in their sporting codes and, in so doing, fly
       the South African flag with pride.

          WALK FOR PROMOTION OF ABSTINENCE FROM SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE

  That the House -


  (1) congratulates "True love waits" and the group of young people
       promoting abstinence from sex before marriage who on Sunday, 9 June
       2002, started walking 50 km per day from Port Shepstone to
       Pietermaritzburg, arriving on Friday, 14 June;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  the walk, coinciding with Youth Month, was to urge youth to
           abstain from sex before marriage; and


       (b)  a crowd of school children thronged along the sidewalk to
           welcome the campaigning youth when they entered Durban on
           Wednesday, 12 June;


  (3) commends Ishmail Maluleke, leading goalscorer for Manning Rangers in
       the Premier Soccer League last season, for his participation and
       agrees with his comments that "this is a very good cause as many
       youngsters contract the killer disease and it is up to us to ensure
       that we are protected against HIV/Aids, and the best way to do that
       is to abstain"; and


  (4) also commends the Minister of Health and the provincial MEC for
       Health, who gave their support to the initiative.

Agreed to.

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move the draft

  That, in the event of the National Council of Provinces agreeing to the
  Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill [B 15B - 2002] (National

  TO THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE AFRICAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY RELATING TO THE
                           PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT

Report adopted without debate.

 PROTOCOL TO THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE AFRICAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY RELATING
             TO THE PAN AFRICAN PARLIAMENT ACCORDINGLY APPROVED.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I have been  advised  by  the  Minister  of
Foreign Affairs that the instruments of ratification of this  protocol  that
we have just agreed to will be deposited with the OAU prior  to  the  summit
next week. [Applause.]

Tomorrow there will be a historic meeting in this Chamber when members of
over 27 parliaments from Africa will come together to discuss the African
Union and the Pan-African Parliament. This will be the first occasion when
so many African parliaments will come together and exchange views on how
they can work to build African unity. I wished to inform you of that.

Many of you will not be here, because you will be on recess. I am sure that
in your constituencies you will be helping to build this nation, as well as
African unity. I do wish you well during the period before you come back.

                            PERSONAL EXPLANATION

The SPEAKER: Hon members, earlier this month a matter was referred to the
Disciplinary Committee. I have received the report of the Disciplinary
Committee. Based on that, hon member Solo wishes to make a statement to
this House.

Mr B M SOLO: Madam Speaker, I will be brief. The comment that was made, was
made within the context of the debate that was taking place. I note that
certain people felt very offended and for the remarks I made, I duly
apologise. [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I accept his apology. [Applause.]

 CONSIDERATION OF FIRST REPORT OF RULES COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, 2002

Declarations of vote:

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, question time in this House makes a mockery
of the concept of the constitutional imperatives of parliamentary scrutiny
and oversight, and holding the executive to account. [Interjections.] The
proposed Rules require that up to 16 days' notice be given for oral
questions and follow-up questions are severely restricted.

The Rules Committee had the benefit of a comparative study of seven other
countries. Question time in Canada was described as, and I quote from the
report, ``a relatively free-wheeling affair with tremendous spontaneity and
vitality''. On each sitting day there is a 45-minute question period for
oral questions without notice. What a contrast to what we have in this
Chamber!

In Germany, five days' notice is required; in Botswana, three working days;
and in Zambia, only half a day, and there are questions on every sitting
day. In Finland, no notice is required. In the UK, in Prime Minister's
question time, no notice of the question content is required. In Australia,
there is no notice and they have questions every sitting day.
[Interjections.]

Are our Cabinet Ministers so timid, so insecure or so incompetent that they
have to be shielded from vigorous and spontaneous scrutiny? Hardly
surprising, given the appalling lack of effective delivery of services to
the people. Hardly surprising, given that the Rule changes have been driven
by the Deputy President's parliamentary counsellor, whose job is to protect
the interests of the executive, not those of members of Parliament.

The proposed Rules are designed to protect the President and Ministers, not
to hold them to account in a meaningful way. The DP will not support the
further erosion of democracy in South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Chairperson, at a time when more attention is focused on
how effectively Ministers are managing the delivery of services, we believe
that a member's right to hold the executive accountable must be
strengthened rather than weakened. This calls, in the first instance, for
an honest and critical appraisal of our system of questions since it is one
of the most transparent ways of holding the executive to account.

There are some weaknesses in the system. Firstly, very few questions get
answered orally so that a member has a chance to engage the Minister.
Secondly, sometimes Ministers have been evasive in their answers, and with
a single follow-up question it is difficult to pinpoint the issue a member
wants to expose. Thirdly, some guidelines are needed to protect the Chair,
which is sometimes perceived as having selective vision when some parties
end up not having the opportunity to put follow-up questions during a
sitting. In this way parties' right to hold the executive accountable is
diminished.

However, in line with our character, we will be consistent and support the
present system of questions with the knowledge that further amendments will
be effected which may include the reintroduction of interpellations.
[Applause.]

Mnr J DURAND: Mnr die Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP is verheug dat daar vandag 'n
besluit geneem word oor die nuwe vraestelsel. Die proeftydperk vir die nuwe
vraestelsel duur nou al reeds meer as twee jaar. Dit is tyd dat die Reëls
sodanig verander word sodat dit die nuwe stelsel vervat. Die sweperye van
alle partye het op 'n deurlopende basis hierdie nuwe vraestelsel gemonitor
en indringend bespreek. Hierdie besprekings het ook gelei tot sekere
wysigings aan die nuwe stelsel. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[Mr J DURAND: Mr Chairman, the New NP is delighted about the fact that a
decision will be made regarding the new question system today. The trial
period of the new question system has already been longer than two years.
It is time for the Rules to be changed so that it entails the new system.
The Whipperies of all parties have monitored and discussed this new
question system in great detail on an ongoing basis. These discussions also
led to certain amendments to the new system.]

Some of these amendments contain very positive aspects. The number of
supplementary questions was reduced from five to four in order to save some
time.

Previously, the time limit for a reply to a supplementary question was at
the presiding officer's discretion. In terms of the new Rules, Ministers
and Deputy Ministers answering supplementary questions will be limited to
two minutes. This saves a tremendous amount of time and allows for more
questions to be answered during question time. [Interjections.]
The New NP will support the decision. [Interjections.] [Applause.] We are
of the opinion that this new system has been tried and tested and has
already become part and parcel of our new democratic Parliament. The old
arguments about the advantages and disadvantages of the old interpellation
system and the old question system have been dealt with in this House on
several occasions. We have now reached the point where clarity is needed
regarding the question system that this democratic Parliament has decided
to implement.

It stands to reason that the New NP is of the opinion that Parliament
should always strive to improve its proceedings and, for this reason, there
should always be ample opportunity to place suggestions on the table that
can bring about improvements to the system. The New NP has already
approached the Speaker with a request to assist in solving problems
relating to delayed responses to written questions asked by MPs. This
matter will have to be addressed as a matter of urgency.

Met die voorbehoud dat die stelsel verder gemonitor en geëvalueer word,
asook dat daar voorsiening gemaak word dat die nodige regstellings
aangebring kan word, steun die Nuwe NP hierdie besluit. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[On condition that the system continues to be monitored and evaluated, as
well as that provision is being made for the necessary adjustments to be
maid, the New NP supports this decision. [Applause.]]

Mr S ABRAM: Mr Chairperson, one must accept that no innovation is cast in
stone. Of course, interpellations were an innovation which came about, I
think, during the time of the three-chamber Parliament. They had served
their purpose and we cannot be held back. We have to accept that there must
be new innovations. As time progresses there are new demands and we need to
answer the demands of the time.

The current system which is being finalised today, hopefully - I am certain
that a majority will support it - is a system which allows for engagement
also by the smallest of small parties. As a result, if the official
Opposition believe that they should have a monopoly and that they should
try to sustain a monopoly, then they are living in a fool's paradise.
[Interjections.] Smaller parties in our democratic system should be ...

Ag man, die helfte van julle is brakke wat net kan blaf. [Gelag.]
[Applous.] Bly stil, man! [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Oh, man half of you are dogs that can only  bark.  [Laughter.]  [Applause.]
Keep quiet, man! [Interjections.]]

All I would like to appeal for is that, even if there are  stupid  follow-up
questions from the Opposition, hon Ministers should respond to them and  see
to it that they respond with dignity, even to stupid questions.

As far as we are concerned, this system is conducive to good debate  and  to
allowing maximum involvement. Of course, it may not be perfect, but as  time
goes on we will have to adapt it.

We from the UDM support the system and therefore we support the adoption  of
this report. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, it is over two years since the trial run of
the new questions system commenced. The system has advantages and
disadvantages, but the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages.
Parties that fail to follow up on questions set do so of their own
volition. The system provides that if the order in which questions are put
to the President and Deputy President is interrupted, the next turn to
answer the question will resume from the point where the order was
interrupted, thus ensuring that all parties have turns to put questions to
the Presidency.
Research has shown, however, that elsewhere, even in Africa, the period
between the asking of the question and the reply from the executive, be it
oral or otherwise, is much shorter. We hope that with the passage of time
replies to questions will be given more promptly because politics is
dynamic, and what is new today may be stale in the next six hours. Waiting
for up to a week for a reply is long and two weeks, as in the case of the
Deputy President and the President, is rather too long.

Let us hope that in time to come we shall have a situation in which members
of the executive can answer questions ex tempore. The UCDP will
nevertheless support the proposed amendments to the Rules of the National
Assembly. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, the review of the
existing question procedure started in the Chief Whips' Forum at the
beginning of the year 2000, so it is important to take stock of the
existing practice and the actual experience.

There have been a number of extensions granted up until today and today has
to become a deciding factor. However, let us work on the basis of the
existing experience. Out of 17 question days between May and November 2001,
the ANC had 53 questions and the DP 35, few in number as they are.

Furthermore, a very small party, such as the ACDP, had 13 questions. In
other words, this clearly indicates that the advantage of this particular
system is a fair spread right across parties.

Out of supplementaries, the ANC, in the same period between May and
November 2001, had 66 supplementary questions and the DP 121.
[Interjections.] A party that is represented by only one member in this
House, the AEB, had 17 supplementary questions. Clearly, that also
reinforces the huge advantages of this particular system. [Applause.]

The basic principle underlying the question system that we want to pass
today is that each party has a right to a question, and as the ANC we want
to endorse that principle. We support this particular new amendment.
[Applause.]

Report adopted (Democratic Party dissenting).

     THE PRISON SITUATION IN SOUTH AFRICA, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO
                              GROOTVLEI PRISON

                          (Subject for discussion)

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Chairperson, I would, first of all, like to thank Madam
Speaker, in her absence, for granting this debate, as well as my Chief
Whip, the hon Douglas Gibson.

I furthermore wish to thank Minister Skosana for his presence and his
concern, as well as every hon member who will be participating today. I
urge each and every member in this House today to rise above our ordinary
political differences. Let us expose yet another crisis for what it is.

This is also an opportunity to show how serious we are. The difference
between ordinary people and achieving people is their perception of and
their response to failure.

My party en die Demokratiese Alliansie wil dit wat by die Grootvlei-
gevangenis gebeur, in die sterkste moontlike terme verwerp. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[My party and the Democratic Alliance want to reject, in the strongest
possible terms, what is happening at the Grootvlei prison.]

South Africa today is crying ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, can I disturb you. Order!
Hon members, could you leave the Chamber quietly or be seated. Please
continue, hon member.

Mrs P W CUPIDO: South Africa today is crying out for leadership that sees
with a clear eye, that speaks with an honest voice and that acts with swift
resolution for the good of all the people; leadership that faces difficulty
without flinching and does the right thing even if that goes against narrow
partisan interests; leadership that shoulders responsibility, that never
seeks scapegoats to blame or invents enemies to hate, that gives clear
direction and that trusts people and wins their faith in return.

That was a quotation from a speech by the hon Tony Leon, delivered on 13
February 2001 in this House.

After Minister Skosana was appointed in 1998 corruption and
maladministration skyrocketed, which led him to appoint the Public Service
Commission, the Department of the Public Service and Administration and the
Jali commission to conduct audits and investigations.

Wat ons moet besef, is dat hierdie kommissies slegs ondersoeke loods,
waarna hulle hul bevindings en aanbevelings aan die Minister voorlê. Die
Minister moet dan optree. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[What we must realise, is that those commissions only initiate
investigations, after which they submit their findings and recommendations
to the Minister. The Minister then has to act.]

The investigations conducted by the Public Service Commission last year
found, inter alia, inadequate recruitment selection procedures; poor
investigation of qualifications and instances of potential nepotism in
staff appointments; a backlog in the filling of advertised posts;
insensitive application of the department's affirmative action policy;
bursaries not properly awarded; disciplinary action and dismissals
compromised by a lack of preparation and planning; arbitrary handling of
staff transfers; unprocedural staff performance-based cash awards;
officials occupying state quarters while still receiving home owners'
allowances; the abuse of remunerated overtime; R68 million lost to sick
leave in the department during the period of 1 April 1999 to March 2000;
and shortcomings in human resources management.

The Public Service Commission also reported, in September 2001, on the
management of suspensions, that a total amount of R1,8 million was paid to
suspended employees over a period of eight months. This means that there
are several staff members who sit at home receiving salaries and whose
cases have not been investigated and finalised yet.

Daar is verlede jaar 279 gevalle van korrupsie, wanadministrasie, omkopery,
seksuele teistering en mishandeling gerapporteer. Net 79 is ondersoek en
het tot op datum slegs een ontslag opgelewer, en dit binne 15 maande. Die
gebeurlikheid by die Grootvlei-gevangenis in die Vrystaat is van die
jongste gevalle wat ontbloot is.

Die Demokratiese Alliansie en die DP versoek dat die Minister, as 'n saak
van dringendheid, beleid hersien, dat verhore van sekere sake van 'n
ernstige aard binne 48 uur geskied en dat hy kyk na 'n spertyd waarvolgens
alle ondersoeke van personeelverwante oortredings in Korrektiewe Dienste
binne drie maande volledig afgehandel word, omdat kriminele nie kriminele
kan oppas nie.
Die Minister moet vandag vir ons sê wat presies die voorlopige Jali-verslag
oplewer. Is die personeel wat hulle skuldig gemaak het aan dwelmsmokkelary
en die verskaffing van brandewyn aan die gevangenes, aan die verhandeling
van vuurwapens en aan die ruilhandel van jeugdige gevangenes aan volwasse
gevangenes vir seksuele aktiwiteite steeds in diens? Is hulle tydelik
geskors met salarisse of is hulle dalk permanent geskors?

Dit is absoluut onaanvaarbaar en met groot ontsteltenis dat hierdie Huis en
die publiek moes kennis neem dat direkteur Setlai verplaas is. Dit is
belangrik dat hy bly waar hy is omdat hy presies weet wat daar by Grootvlei
gebeur het.

Die Minister moet ook vir ons sê wat presies sy besluit is met betrekking
tot direkteur Setlai se posisie. Verder moet hy verklaar wat sy optrede of
besluit is in verband met senior personeel wat opdrag gegee het dat die
bewyse verbrand moes word.

Die grootste probleem in die agb Minister se departement  is  die  personeel
op middel en senior bestuursvlak. Dit is ook waar  die  oplossings  lê.  Van
die 35 000 lede in Korrektiewe Dienste is 12 000 tot  15 000  in  middel  en
senior bestuur. Die frustrasie van mnr Setlai oor die onvermoë  en  korrupte
gedrag van sy personeel het daartoe gelei dat hy toestemming gegee  het  dat
daardie video gemaak word, en hy moet natuurlik beskerm  word  en  erkenning
kry vir wat hy gedoen het. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Last year 279 incidents of corruption, maladministration, bribery, sexual
harassment and maltreatment were reported. Only 79 have been investigated
and this has to date only led to one dismissal, and that within 15 months.
What happened at the Grootvlei prison in the Free State ranks among the
latest incidents that have been uncovered.

The Democratic Alliance and the DP request that the Minister, as a matter
of urgency, revise policy, that hearings of certain cases of a serious
nature take place within 48 hours and that he look into setting a deadline
according to which all investigations of personnel-related transgressions
in Correctional Services are completely finalised within three months,
because criminals cannot look after criminals.

The Minister has to tell us today exactly what the provisional Jali report
has yielded. Are the personnel who were guilty of drug trafficking and the
supply of brandy to the inmates, of trading in firearms and of the exchange
of juvenile inmates, providing them to adult inmates for sexual activities,
still employed? Have they been temporarily suspended with salary or have
they been permanently suspended?

It is absolutely unacceptable that, to their great dismay, this House and
the public had to learn that director Setlai has been transferred. It is
important that he should stay where he is, because he knows exactly what
happened at Grootvlei.

The Minister also has to tell us what exactly he has decided in relation to
director Setlai's position. Furthermore, he has to explain what action or
decision he is to take regarding senior personnel who gave orders that the
evidence should be burnt.

The biggest problem in the hon the Minister's department is that of the
personnel at middle and senior management level. That is also where the
solutions lie. Of the 35 000 members in Correctional Services, 12 000 to 15
000 are in middle and senior management. The frustration of Mr Setlai about
the incompetence and corrupt behaviour of his staff led to his giving
permission for that video to be made, and he must naturally be protected
and receive recognition for what he has done.]

Minister Skosana said, in a speech at the Pollsmoor management area on
Youth Day, 16 June 2001, and I quote:


  But the freedom that we have in our young democracy should not be seen as
  a passport to crime and the abdication of responsibility. Government is
  committed to the establishment of a nonracial, egalitarian and crime-free
  society.

Sad to say, some members of Government might be in possession of such
passports.

If this Government must rely on those behind bars to catch the perpetrators
amongst those who watch and oversee them, then it is long overdue that this
ANC-led Government accept full responsibility and rather stand back and
save this country further embarrassment.

The voters out there are not blind; they judge us by our association.
Association brings resemblance. The Minister's problem is that most of the
staff are comrades and they respond to their responsibilities just as they
observe their political leaders doing. [Interjections.]

I say, again, that the commission's concern can only inform the Minister.
Transformation starts with the Minister and those in the department who
understand the seriousness of the problem that faces us.

What we have seen on TV is only the tip of the iceberg. It is necessary
that the Minister also expose officials, especially in other major prisons,
such as the Durban Westville management area and the Johannesburg,
Pretoria, Pollsmoor and Leeukop management areas. There might also be
others that the Minister regards as priorities.

The DA says that the management in each prison and in each province and the
National Commissioner, Mr Mti, should, first of all, take responsibility
for all this chaos. Management is definitely accountable. They should play
the ball in the court where it belongs.

Further investigations should stretch across officials and prisoners,
especially juveniles who have been sexually abused and used for drug
trafficking in prisons. To avoid further corruption, intimidation,
victimisation, drug trafficking and sexual abuse, the Minister must
consider installing cameras in all prisons. He must also say whether there
is a director appointed to take charge of exposing and eliminating
corruption. Audiovisual technology is successfully used in sports to root
out wrong decisions in sport.

The DA municipality in Cape Town has installed cameras right across the
city in order to catch thieves, and that is the reason the crime rate in
the CBD area of Cape Town and other areas has dropped drastically.

We have surveillance cameras on our roads in order to catch road thugs -
speed traps, as some call them. We even have cameras in this Chamber to
show the taxpayers on open time which MPs sleep and which keep their seats
warm. [Interjections.]

Cameras in stores and other places of business are now taking the place of
police officers. The Minister must not wait another 15 months to report on
this matter. The request of the DA is that he report back to this House
within the next six months. [Applause.]
Mr N B FIHLA: Chairperson, as the Government of South Africa, we say that
we are winning the war against crime; that the tougher laws, the harsher
penalties and the commitment of our police force are combining to finally
bring an end to the escalating levels of crime.

However, recent revelations around corruption in our prisons cast a dark
cloud over our entire justice system and negate my opening comments. The
rise in our prison population since the early 1990s has put a stranglehold
on our prison system and has forced prisons to operate at levels far
exceeding their mandated maximums. The result is that the department's
rehabilitation work is severely curtailed and the efficiency of the
department is compromised - all the more so when budget limits have forced
the department to use most of its resources just for the daily living
expenses of prisoners.

The department has the duty to control prisoners efficiently, improve the
behaviour and personalities of prisoners and successfully develop the
administration of correctional services. By any standards this is indeed a
tall order. Given the low staff morale, staff shortages, allegations of
nepotism, certain staff fraudulently acquiring employment in the department
and criminal activities committed by some staff members, is it any wonder
that the department has been rocked by the latest allegations of corruption
and maladministration?

This dire situation calls for intervention by the hon the President and the
hon the Minister. The Minister's commitment to good and clean governance
saw him approach the Auditor-General, the Public Service Commission and the
Department of Public Service and Administration to conduct audits and
investigations in 1999. The reports from both the PSC and the DPSA listed
wide-ranging violations by some staff in the Department of Correctional
Services with regard to qualifications, the filling of posts, the awarding
of staff bursaries, transfers, disciplinary action, dismissals, merit
awards and compensation for utilisation in higher posts.
All these violations were addressed by recommendations by the PSC and the
DPSA, of course, and these resulted in investigations and conclusive action
taken by the department.

However, continued acts of corruption, maladminstration and violence within
the department forced the Minister to appoint the Jali commission of
inquiry. The commission has been instructed to focus its inquiry into
prisons on the eight management areas identified. However, the situation at
Grootvlei came to light, and the Jali commission was instructed to extend
its investigation to include this prison as well.

The media have certainly raised debate around the revelations of the
investigation. We are left to question the decay in our society when people
entrusted with securing the safety of ordinary citizens from convicted
offenders violate that sense of security. We question the integrity and
morals of our society when employees in correctional facilities collude
with convicted criminals to damage our youth and thereby the next
generation of our society. We question a situation in which victims of
crime, who gain some form of comfort from knowing that the perpetrators of
crime are locked up, now question the rule of justice in the country and
are dismayed and discouraged.

Are we heading for a lawless society where honest citizens are at  risk?  We
have a nation built upon literacy, morals and decency. The choice is ours.

The Department of Correctional Services, while faced with criticism from
all quarters, also has in its ranks honourable staff who are committed and
unwavering in their support, not only to the department but to the Jali
commission as well. These dedicated individuals have a thankless job, and
they work under difficult circumstances. I think that not one of us sitting
here today would want to be in their situation. Yet we expect miracles in
the hardened environment of the prison.

The Minister has also seen fit to approach the Minister for Justice and
Constitutional Development for an investigation to be done by the Special
Investigating Unit into corruption and maladministration in the Department
of Correctional Services in relation to the following: the medical aid
scheme, procurement problems, nepotism and corruption, the recruitment
process, the violation of prison regulations by members of staff for the
benefit of prisoners and crimes perpetrated by members within the prison
environment in aid of offenders. This investigation will be given weight by
the experienced forensic investigators from the SIU and the joint DCS-SIU
recruitment of staff to fill our other posts.

A measure of a progressive state is the way in which it rises to
challenges. Its accountability to the people, its dedication to righting
the wrongs of the past and its commitment to remembering the past so as to
avoid making the same mistakes in future are all indicators of a
progressive state. In this respect, the Department of Correctional Services
has certainly risen to its challenges.

It remains to be seen how far the transformation of our prisons is
successful. The targets are there, although they may be difficult. The
retraining of DCS staff to empower them to facilitate rehabilitation is a
huge undertaking. However, as long as there continue to be staff members in
the prisons who are corrupt and divisive, our prisons will remain hotbeds
of injustice. [Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Chairperson, I concur with the comments made by the two
previous speakers. There is a problem in this country. We have a serious
problem of corruption in the Department of Correctional Services, and
nobody denies that. We accept that there is a serious problem. What has
happened of late, including what we saw in those videos, is really
unacceptable. There are no excuses for corruption, none whatsoever, but I
think we need to look at the contributory factors as well.

There is a saying that goes: Keep your eye on the doughnut, not on the
hole. I think that we, as members of Parliament and citizens of this
country, should be looking at the entire doughnut and not just the hole.
We have already heard from our colleague Mr Fihla about the problem of
insufficient funding. We do not have sufficient funding in the Department
of Correctional Services to deal with the problems there. The overcrowding
in this country's prisons is totally unacceptable, and it is something we
have to deal with collectively. The staff shortages are unbelievable. The
ratio of prisoners to warders is one of the worst in the world.

The morale of our department heads and officials is low, owing to the poor
pay, to bad working conditions, to the poor public perception of the
department's members and to the inadequate facilities. The department
inherited a system that is so flawed that it is going to take a great deal
of time to sort out. The social circumstances of the majority of South
Africans actually create the problems that we have, as do the bottleneck in
the justice system and the lack of new facilities.

We could go on and on, but what about the progress that has been made?
Firstly, the Ministry and the department have recognised that there is a
corruption problem. The Minister has actually recognised this problem and
brought in and initiated various commissions and investigations. The
Minister called for the Jali commission to be established. The Minister and
his department are committed to fighting corruption and crime. The
department has introduced a new management system. There is continuous
retraining of members.

Yes, there is a great deal still to be done. A lot of members need to be
retrained, but the beginning has already happened. The commitment to
segregating the different categories of criminals is another thing that is
going to make a difference. At present people are lumped together; all
sorts of criminals are thrown into prison together, and the hardened
criminals are actually teaching the lesser criminals how they can go about
plying their trade.

The continued efforts of the department to confine prisoners, but at the
same time rehabilitate them, are to be commended. The introduction of the
independent prison visitors and the inspecting judge is progress. The
recent launch of the restorative justice system is progress. The
establishment of self-sufficient institutions is an improvement. It is all
progress towards sorting out the overcrowding and corruption in our
prisons.

Corruption is not the problem of the Department of Correctional Services or
the Government alone. It is the problem of every single member of
Parliament and every member of the South African community. It is a
collective responsibility. Business is corrupt. Business causes some of the
corruption in the Department of Correctional Services. People are paying
officials money in order to be awarded contracts. That is corruption from
the other side. We need to call upon business to stop that corruption. We
need to look at political parties. They should be doing something amongst
their own people and within their own communities.

Corruption does not start in the Department of Correctional Services; it
starts in society. The law must be upheld at all times and at all levels.
There is no doubt about that. Those who have offended must be dealt with,
and I am sure that the Minister and the department will deal with those who
have been involved. But management must be in control. To say that
departmental heads or prison heads should be promoted because they exposed
things is not the way to deal with this. They should have come back to the
department and reported what they suspected.

Corruption should be dealt with correctly and management should be in
control. It is because the Department of Correctional Services is in
control of the situation that these investigations have taken place. The
very prisons that my colleague, Mrs Cupido, mentioned have, in fact, been
investigated. The Minister called for investigations there, and it is
because of the investigations that the corruption has been exposed.

A lot still has to be done and a great deal more control needs to be taken
by management for corruption to be flushed out. The IFP commits itself to
playing an active, positive role in bringing about the changes needed to
beef up our system and to ensure that corruption is eradicated, that
rehabilitation becomes the norm and that our prisons are well run and no
longer overcrowded.

We will continue to fight for more funds to be made available to the
Department of Correctional Services. We will see to it that an adequate
ratio of prisoners to warders comes about in this country. We will together
deem it our collective responsibility to strive to ensure that the best
service is delivered by the Department of Correctional Services and by this
Government to ensure that corruption is eradicated. [Applause.]

Mr F J VAN DEVENTER: Chairperson, would those who are interested in what I
am going to say please use their interpretation receiving units. Those who
understand all the official languages will not need to use them.

Ek gaan Afrikaans praat omdat dit ook 'n dispuutpunt in die departement
was: die taal wat ek en baie bewaarders aan moedersknie geleer het, waarin
ons geleer bid het, waarin ons vir ons regte waarvoor ons geveg het en
waarin ek in hierdie Parlement 'n eed gesweer het van trou aan Suid-Afrika,
maar ook die taal waarin ek vandag 'n paar dinge wil sê oor die hele
kwessie van Grootvlei-gevangenis en Korrektiewe Dienste.

Voordat ek by die meer omstrede sake kom, wil ek 'n paar kantaantekeninge
maak oor Grootvlei-gevangenis - ``kantaantekeninge'' nie omdat dit
onbelangrik is nie, maar omdat alles al so dikwels gesê is dat dit begin
retories raak. Die probleem van hierdie Parlement en sy komitees is juis sy
praatsiekheid. Ons praat oor alles en nog 'n keer oor alles, ons luister na
urelange voorleggings, maar ons toets nooit die resultate van praktiese
toepassing en ingryping waar nodig nie.

Die Departement van Korrektiewe Dienste het regtens of ten onregte
perseptueel die kollektiewe simbool van hierdie Regering geword. Om daardie
persepsie reg te stel sal genadelose en harde optrede vereis teen wie ook
al skuldig is of probeer toesmeer.

Omdat die omvang van die Grootvlei-gevangenis se morsighede nie tot
Grootvlei beperk is nie, wil ek my versoeke van die verlede hier herhaal.

In die eerste plek, onderwerp alle gevangenisse in Suid-Afrika aan
diepgaande regterlike ondersoeke. Tweedens, laat 'n behoorlike oudit doen
van die topstruktuur, operasioneel en administratief, van die departement -
nie omdat ons hulle by voorbaat van iets verdink nie, maar om vir die
publiek te wys dat hulle bevoeg en betroubaar is. Derdens, verlig die
oorbevolking van gevangenisse nie deur skuldiges vry te laat nie, maar deur
op 'n ander manier huisvesting te verskaf aan verhoorafwagtendes.

Vierdens, skei rehabiliteerbare gevangenes van daardie vir wie misdaad 'n
lewenswyse en 'n loopbaan geword het. Rehabiliteerbare gevangenes is
dikwels slagoffers van hierdie mense en word deur intimidasie en geweld in
die misdaadspiraal binne gevangenisse betrek.

Die vergoeding van bewaarders moet hersien word. Hulle moet genoeg verdien
om te kan leef. Hulle word heeldag blootgestel aan mense wat dikwels meer
uit misdaad maak, as wat hulle verdien. Dit moet mos tot versoekings vir
hierdie mense lei.

Of ons dit nou wil weet of nie, 'n groeiende aantal Suid-Afrikaners is
besig om al dieper weg te sink in 'n moeras van immoraliteit, korrupsie,
geweld en misdaad. Gesag en dissipline, selfs van die staat en die
regspleging word geminag. Die vraag is: Waarom? Armoede, gierigheid,
sosiale isolasie, werkloosheid en gevolglik ledigheid en vele ander dinge
is 'n deel van die antwoord.

Ek wil vanmiddag 'n heilige koei hier bysleep. Ons Handves van Menseregte
en gevolglik ons Grondwet ruk die balans wat daar behoort te wees tussen
beskerming van 'n individu se regte en sy vertrapping van ander se regte
uitmekaar. Daar word hopeloos ontoereikend voorsiening gemaak vir
gemeenskapsregte. Meeste van die lede sal met my verskil, maar die vraag
wat hulle sal moet beantwoord, is of dit nie juis ten grondslag lê van die
polisie se vermeende ontoereikendheid nie? Is dit nie aanmoediging vir
korrupsie en veral geweldsmisdade nie? Is dit nie wat ten grondslag lê van
Suid-Afrika se onvermoë om ekonomies te groei en werk en welvaart te skep
nie? Of 'n persoon iets werd is en of hy niks werd is in sy werkplek nie,
maak nie juis 'n verskil nie. Hy of sy word beskerm.

As daar 'n les uit Grootvleigevangenis se gemors te leer is, dan is dit:
Ons moet dringend begin om ons siekerwordende gemeenskap tot sy sinne te
bring, voordat hy terminaal gediagnoseer word. Om te skerm en vingers te
wys, gaan ons nêrens bring nie. Dit is nou tyd om op te tree. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I am speaking Afrikaans since that was also a point of dispute in the
department: The language which many warders and I were taught as a child;
in which we learned to pray; in which we fought for our rights, and in
which I swore an oath of allegiance to South Africa in this Parliament -
but it is also the language I want to use today to say a few things about
the whole issue of the Grootvlei Prison and the Department of Correctional
Services.

Before I get to the more contentious issues, allow me to make a few ``side-
notes'' about Grootvlei Prison - ``side-notes'', not because they are not
important enough, but because everything has already been said so many
times that it becomes rhetorical. The problem of this Parliament and its
committees is indeed their garrulousness. We talk about something and then
talk again on the same issue, we listen to submissions for hours on end,
but we never test the results of practical application and intervention
where necessary.

The Department of Correctional Services is indeed perceived, rightfully so
or not, as the collective symbol of this Government. Rectifying that
perception will demand harsh and ruthless action against whoever is guilty
or is trying to cover things up.

Since the extent of Grootvlei Prison's mess is not limited to Grootvlei, I
wish to reiterate my former requests.

Firstly, all prisons in South Africa should be subjected to thorough
judicial inquiries. Secondly, have a proper audit done of the top
structure, both operational and administrative, of the department - not
because we suspect them of anything in advance, but to show the public that
they are competent and reliable. Thirdly, we need to alleviate the
overpopulation of prisons, not by setting the guilty free but by providing
a different type of accommodation for those awaiting trial.

Fourthly, separate prisoners who can be rehabilitated from those for whom
crime has become a way of life and a career. Prisoners who can be
rehabilitated are often victims of these people and become part of the
spiral of crime within prisons through intimidation and violence.

The remuneration of warders needs to be revised. They have to earn enough
in order for them to live. All day long they are exposed to people who
often make more out of crime than what they earn. That surely has to lead
these people into temptation.

Whether we want to know it or not, an increasing number of South Africans
are sinking deeper and deeper into a quagmire of immorality, corruption,
violence and crime. The authority and discipline of even the state and the
judiciary are treated with contempt. The question arises: Why is that the
case? Poverty, greed, social isolation, unemployment and resultant
idleness, and many other things form part of the answer.

This afternoon I wish to slaughter a sacred cow. Our Bill of Rights, and
consequently our Constitution, disrupts the balance that should exist
between the protection of the individual's rights on the one hand and the
abuse of another's rights on the other. Hopelessly insufficient provision
is made for communal rights. Most members will differ with me, but the
question that they will have to answer is whether that is not in fact the
basis of the police's alleged inadequacy. Is that not promoting corruption
and violent crime in particular? Is that not the basis of South Africa's
inability to grow economically and to create jobs and prosperity? Whether
or not a person is of any value at his place of work does not really make a
difference. He or she is protected.

If there is a lesson to be learnt from the mess at Grootvlei Prison, then
it is the following: We must urgently begin to bring our increasingly sick
society to its senses before it is diagnosed as being terminally ill. To
evade the issue or to point a finger will get us nowhere. Now is the time
to act.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Chairperson, before I start, I must say, with the
evidence of the cameras around us, that my colleagues and I were watching
with disgust the reaction that we received from officials of the department
sitting in this Chamber. They are laughing about this matter as if it were
a joke. If this is the seriousness that the officials are taking this
matter with, then we have a far more serious problem than any of us can
start to imagine in this House. [Interjections.]

The Grootvlei Prison video tape illustrated graphically our worst fears
regarding the state of South African prisons. The UDM would argue that the
video must be treated as a case study of the state of our prisons. We
should not for one second doubt that the same situation prevails at other
prisons throughout the country. The truth is also that these kinds of
practices are not new. They happened in the past as well. However, what is
of serious concern is the extent of these incidents and the lack of control
thereof. It has spun out of control. Furthermore, even more alarming is the
total absence of a willingness to deal decisively with these revelations on
the part of the management of the Department of Correctional Services.

The commissioner's response is typical of the kneejerk reaction that we
have become used to from Government when corruption is exposed.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Bloem, are you rising on a point
of order?

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, on a point of order I think it is really unfair
for the member at the podium to attack defenceless people who have never
laughed at this debate. Now she is politicising this debate. It is unfair
because the officials cannot speak for themselves, and that is why she is
doing this. My point of order is that it is unfair. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Can I appeal to hon members not to
refer either to visitors in the gallery or to officials in the bays as they
are not part of the debate. Let us proceed with the business before the
House.

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Chairperson, I would also like to bring it to the
attention of the hon Bloem that we are actually busy with politics in this
House. [Interjections.]

In order to deal with this unbearable situation decisively, an umbrella
approach is needed. Exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures
and that is exactly what the UDM proposes.

Mrs B M NTULI: Chairperson on a point of order: I think the hon member is
attacking those people and it would be correct for her to apologise.

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Chairperson, no, I am not apologising, I am sorry.
Then you can remove me.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Ntuli, that is not a point of
order. Please continue, hon member Van Wyk.

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Chairperson, exceptional circumstances require
exceptional measures and this is what we are proposing. The UDM believes
that Correctional Services should immediately implement a system which uses
administrative and technical personnel of Correctional Services to
implement surprise inspections in prisons. These inspections should be
conducted to clear all prisons of contraband items. Alternatively,
personnel from prison A should inspect prison B for such items. This should
be done immediately and then be kept in place for a period of at least a
year. If this is to be successful, then neutral personnel need to conduct
these inspections so that they can do so without fear or favour. In order
to get to a point where we can even start to attempt to bring the situation
under control, a clean area is a non-negotiable prerequisite.

Secondly, we believe that the exposure of corruption should be encouraged
at all costs. In this regard, the transfer of the head of the prison to the
provincial headquarters sends out the wrong message. No matter what spin is
put on it, the message is that speaking out against corruption leads to
persecution by the department. This is a wrong decision. It is within the
Minister's ability to change it. The Minister should please do so.

We urge the Minister, even if it means that he has to review the
regulations, to have an incentive established for warders and prisoners to
come out against corruption. In the case of warders these incentives can
form part of their annual merit assessments. In the case of prisoners, it
could be a decrease of their prison sentence if their participation in
exposing acts of corruption leads to the successful conviction of those
involved. [Time expired.]

Mr S N SWART: Mr Chairman, the ACDP and other parties highlighted the
severe challenges facing the department during the recent budget debate.
Prison overcrowding and staff shortages do not, however, justify the high
levels of fraud and corruption which we are experiencing in our prisons. It
appears, if the department's report and the Jali commission are anything to
go by, that these problems occur in many of our prisons.

Yesterday Commissioner Mti stated in the portfolio committee hearing that
...


  the legal mandate of the department remains unachievable while there
  continue to the staff members in our prisons whose criminal behaviour
  keeps the wounds of corruption, substance abuse, sexual violence and
  crime in our prisons festering.

We in the ACDP are, however, committed to assisting the Minister and the
department in finding a solution to these problems. We do, however, share
the view of other speakers that the video regarding the incidents at
Grootvlei is shocking. I will repeat what I said last week, that the head
of the prison deserves a medal for exposing this crime and corruption.
Something which particularly disturbs me is the careless manner in which a
particular warder was prepared, according to the video footage, to smuggle
a fiream into the prison, knowing full well that this fiream could be used
to murder other warders in an attempted escape.

I also need to comment on the press reports that have hailed the four
prisoners who made the video as crusaders. I find it particularly
reprehensible that the one prisoner, Sekutoane according to media reports,
``only'' sodomised the juvenile prisoner to trap the warder. This prisoner
has admitted to paying warders for juvenile sex many times. I find it
shocking that he has now suddenly been transformed into a crime-fighting
hero by this video.

I also find it shocking that juveniles were allegedly taken from their
cells on the pretext that they had visitors and were then sexually abused,
according to media reports. For a few rands, many of these young lives have
been destroyed.

The ACDP calls for an urgent criminal investigation into these matters. We
also welcome the announcement by the Minister that the Special
Investigating Unit will conduct forensic investigations into corruption. We
await the findings of the Jali commission. [Time expired.]

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, in the year 2000, this House adopted a
specific Act, the Protected Disclosures Act, Act 26 of 2000. The Act's long
title states its object as follows:


  To make provision for procedures in terms of which employees in both the
  private and the public sector may disclose information regarding unlawful
  or irregular conduct by their employers or other employees in the employ
  of their employers ...

The preamble of this Act states, and I quote, that ``every employer and
employee has a responsibility to disclose criminal and any other irregular
conduct in the workplace'' and that ``every employer has a responsibility
to take all necessary steps to ensure that employees who disclose such
information are protected from any reprisals as a result of such
disclosure''.

We must ask ourselves in this debate whether we are following the
principles of this Act.

Nee, die verantwoordelikhede wat ook op die werkgewer berus, word deur
hierdie optrede om die hoof van die Grootvleigevangenis te verskuif, 'n
streep deur getrek. Dit help nie ons kom maak wette en as dit toegepas
word, dan is dit 'n geval van ``shoot the messenger''nie.

Dit is 'n werklikheid dat hierdie film 'n klad is op die naam van DKD. Dit
gaan nie die klad skoonmaak om van die mense wat dit bekend gemaak het, te
wil rondskuif en teen hulle te wil optree nie. Die VF se standpunt is: Tree
op teen die oortreders. Ons weet almal dat by gevangenisse is dit
kriminele, maar moenie dat ons self kriminele word om wette te oortree nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[No, the responsibilities of the employer are being hampered by this action
to move the head of the Grootvlei Prison. It does not help that we make
laws and when it comes to its enforcement, it is a case of shoot the
messenger.

It is a reality that this film is a slur on the name of DCS. We will not
get rid of the slur by moving around or taking action against those people
who made this known. The standpoint of the FF is as follows: Act against
the transgressors. We all know that we have criminals at prisons but let us
not become criminals ourselves by breaking the laws.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, on the occasion of the debate on the
Correctional Services Budget Vote on on 4 June, I raised the question of
the Department having officers who seem to be a law unto themselves. I feel
vindicated by what has since been revealed at Grootvlei Prison.

Prisons seem to be the greatest centres of corruption as against correction
and rehabilitation. If 28 officers at Grootvlei alone get implicated in
acts of corruption, that sounds as if it is a permanent and normal feature
of the institution. Commissioner Linda Mti, addressing the portfolio
committee yesterday, said, and I quote:


  ... the legal mandate of the department remains unachievable while there
  continue to be staff members in our prisons whose criminal behaviour keep
  the wounds of corruption, substance abuse, sexual violence and crime in
  our prisons festering.
We surely have a problem on our hands if the commissioner can say this
about his officers. We may have potential inmates of those prisons dressed
in officers' uniforms. It is unfortunate that the bureau seems to be
pointing a finger at the officer who authorised the filming of the video at
Grootvlei while downplaying the blatant acts of corruption perpetrated by
the officers at the prison.

The prison warders at Grootvlei continued to show gross disregard for
authority when a week went past without their responding to notices asking
them to show cause why they should not be suspended. The notices, according
to the reports, had to be responded to within 24 hours of receipt. If this
is not insubordination, then tell me what it is.

Allegations to the effect that some white prisoner at the same prison used
the k word when referring to black members of the commission have to be
investigated thoroughly. Drastic action has to be taken if someone is
finally found guilty. A question that goes begging is: What do this officer
and others of his ilk call black inmates and how does he treat them? [Time
expired.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, the PAC is familiar with prison conditions in
South Africa, especially from the time of the kidnapping of its former
chief of operations Letlapa Mphahlele from Lesotho in 1996 and his
subsequent imprisonment in Grootvlei, where a number of former Apla members
were also imprisoned. The conditions at Grootvlei were not much different
from those under the apartheid regime. For example, Thabiso Magwala was
assaulted viciously until he bled through his nose and mouth and later
died. Malusi Morrison was refused medical treatment. When he threatened
that he would sue the state, he was asked if he would sue the state if he
lived in Cuba.

Immediate steps must be taken by the Minister of Correctional Services.
Juveniles must not be mixed with adults. This is happening in many prisons
because of prison overcrowding, and sodomy is the order of the day. The
four whistle-blowers at Grootvlei who are prisoners there must be removed
from there and be detained elsewhere.

The PAC finds it strange that Mr Tatolo Setlai, who resisted pressure to
destroy the video tape revealing the corruption in Grootvlei, is being made
a target. Of course, it is important to know how the video camera found its
way to four criminals in Grootvlei and the real motive for this. For
instance, was it to expose corruption or was it there for something else?

Finally, this is the time to affirm and strengthen the hand of the Minister
of Correctional Services, who has done a sterling job of bringing
transformation to one of the most conservative institutions of our land.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF has firstly to express its shock,
disgust and disappointment at the Grootvlei prison situation. It is
understood that our justice system is firmly structured to protect South
Africa and all South Africans. Our correctional services are well
structured to instil rehabilitation, prevention, retribution and so many
other programmes to protect our community, and assist those doing wrong in
not doing so again.

With regard to the incident at Grootvlei, the MF finds it shocking that
these things managed to surface and become public; that it was no
speculation but it is what is happening at prisons throughout the country.
The matter is being dealt with far too leniently. Our prisoners are people
with constitutional rights too. Let us bear that in mind. Our prison
warders and persons who seek to participate in the correctional services
need to have instilled in their duties and deep within themselves our
constitutional values as well as the law as a primary activity.

The MF proposes that the situation in prisons be looked into and that
nothing be kept from the eyes of our people. We are all here to serve the
people of South Africa and ensure that delivery takes place in a most
transparent and honest manner. This incident has painted a poor picture of
South Africa's correctional services and certainly makes the community lose
its confidence in our system, and that is totally unacceptable. We hope
that the Minister will get every assistance in overcoming these situations
in our prisons.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, vergun my enkele aantekeninge wat gemaak
moet word in hierdie debat. In die eerste plek, die AEB salueer die rol van
die media. 'n Saak wat al lankal broei onder die kombers het op die
nasionale agenda gekom, danksy 'n televisieprogram, Special Assignment.
Daarom het ons vandag hierdie debat. Laat hierdie insident vir ons 'n
wekroep wees om nooit die vryheid van die media hoegenaamd aan bande te wil
lê, selfs al sou dit nie 'n aangename boodskap wees wat tot ons kom nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, allow me a few comments which must be made in
this debate. In the first place, the AEB salutes the role of the media. A
matter which has been simmering for a long time has reached the national
agenda thanks to a television programme, Special Assignment. For that
reason we have this debate today. Let this incident be a clarion call for
us never to want to curb the freedom of the media in any way, even if the
message which reaches us is an unpleasant one.]

Secondly, the reaction to the programme was perhaps just as alarming as the
programme itself. The commissioner on TV, in my view, was too indecisive in
rejecting just everything. The negative reaction against the whistle-
blowers, the four inmates, and the prison head, Mr Setlai, derailed the
whole issue.

Asof wat hulle gedoen het die oortreding was, eerder as wat in die tronke
aangaan. [As if what they did was the offence, rather than what is
happening in the prisons.]

In terms of the general reaction, this incident cannot be isolated. It
happens in other prisons, it happens in other departments, it happens in
other spheres of public and private life. Let this be an alarm signal
warning us that corruption should be combated in every place and any
sphere.

With regard to the prisons, anybody calling prisons a place of
rehabilitation right now must surely be joking. It needs a holistic
approach and clean-up, and a new model has to be introduced.

'n Laaste punt, baie ongewild: Die AEB vra dat lyfstraf teruggebring word
in Suid-Afrika. Ons sit met oorvol tronke. Slaan liewers die jong
misdadigers se agterstewes aan die brand en stuur hulle dan huistoe. Ons
skree vir menseregte, maar ons laat toe dat jong manne wat ligte
oortredings begaan het, die doodsvonnis kry deur hulle tronk toe te stuur
om verkrag en gesodomiseer te word en met die HIV-virus besmet te word. Kom
ons vergeet hierdie skynheiligheid en bring lyfstraf terug. Ons sal sommer
baie probleme sodoende oplos. Die AEB doen 'n beroep dat hierdie ding sal
lei tot 'n omvattende plan om alles te hersien. [Tyd
verstreke.][Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[One last point, which is very unpopular: The AEB requests that corporal
punishment be reintroduced in South Africa. We have overpopulated prisons.
Rather hit the young offenders' backsides until they burn and then send
them home. We are crying out for human rights, but we allow young men who
have committed minor offences to receive a death sentence by sending them
to prison to be raped and sodomised and infected with HIV. Let us forget
this hypocrisy and bring corporal punishment back. In this way we will
solve many problems. The AEB appeals that this thing will lead to a
comprehensive plan to review everything. [Time expired.] [Interjections.]]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, the conditions prevalent in our prisons
are not something new. Our prisons, with few exceptions, as in the olden
days, remain places for reforming those who have been convicted, but they
are places where corruption, vice and wrongdoing are prevalent. We must
remember that we have inherited a system which was designed not to
rehabilitate anybody and, therefore, we must not forget that the task of
redressing that will take a long time.

One is very happy that the Minister has actually started that process. We
must not forget that this is a very long process in which we, all together,
must assist in seeing to it that it achieves its end objectives. It has
been done in respect of the SA Police Service and, if we do the same here,
we are most likely to succeed.

However, I want to make two statements before I end. We can teach prisoners
as much as we can, but we must remember that the society in which we live
is culpable for not providing institutions and corrective education capable
of producing prison staff and inmates that can champion the values and
norms of the new society. The guilty are not only those who commit crime
but also those who create the conditions for crime to be committed. We
therefore call on the department to continue with its efforts to transform
the prison services. [Applause.]

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Mr Chairperson, I want to start by doing the unusual, ie
thanking the hon Cupido for raising for discussion a matter of national
significance. It is about time that an issue of this nature confronted us,
one of national significance that needs to be discussed very soberly. I
must also say that when we discuss this issue we must recall the words of
our former President when he said:


  The way a nation handles its prisoners is a reflection of that society.

I think that is very valid. It is something that we must recall all the
time when we discuss issues pertaining to correctional services. However,
we must be in a position to recall that we are not only dealing with
prisoners. We are also dealing with those who have to make sure that the
prisoners are punished and rehabilitated. Those people are the prison
warders and the staff members. I think that anybody who comes to this
podium and rubbishes the work of the warders is, at best, an individual of
no consequence. I think we should refrain from doing that.

Those who fought for freedom and democracy, and even paid the supreme
sacrifice for that freedom, are the ones who have created the space and an
enabling environment where such video footage could be flighted. Today, in
this our solid and consolidating democracy, we will not - I repeat, we will
not - take to the gallows those who took the steps to remind us of our our
responsibility to root out corruption.

The contents of the Grootvlei prison video footage flighted on national
television in the recent past are shocking, alarming and unspeakable. Be
that as it may, it is only the tip of the iceberg. We must remember that
the prison system finds itself at the end of the pipeline of our societal
problems. As public representatives, let us look at the bigger picture.
Firstly, may I ask that we examine that which has been done so far. Since
his appointment, Minister Skosana has focused on the fight against
corruption in his department. Given the extent and nature of the corruption
in the DCS, there can be no quick fix to corruption. As a result of the
Minister's work and particularly his response to the murder of Thuthu
Bhengu at Pietermaritzburg prison, Minister Skosana requested the President
to set up the Jali commission.

If we reflect over the past year, we will note that the Jali commission has
been working in close co-operation with the senior management of the
Department of Correctional Services; that steps are being taken to
implement recommendations on the interim reports of the Jali commission;
that an interdepartmental investigative task team has been established or
is being established to be on standby to investigate any information from
whistle-blowers; that a lot of effort has gone and must continue to go into
ensuring that the space and temptation for corruption and criminal activity
by the management of the prison system are minimised and that decisive
steps are taken to uproot corruption wherever it occurs.

As we talk about what needs to be done, we should not lose sight of three
factors that militate against the prison management's success in their
work. The first is overcrowding and, hence, the overextension of members of
staff in the prisons. The second is the inadequate retraining of DCS staff
to understand the current paradigm and to be able to manage appropriately.
The third issue that militates against the department's success is the
incoherence of discipline in the DCS.

In the wake of all these issues, we call upon the leadership of the DCS to
develop feasible plans to build an institutional capacity to fight a
culture of corruption that dates back many decades. The DCS management
should utilise the Grootvlei video to strengthen the anticorruption
programme both in the preventive and the combative sense. Crime and
corruption are inherent to the community of inmates. The challenge of a
clean prison system is a world-wide phenomenon. Extra vigilance in
management style and tightened discipline in the department are required at
all times.

Now that we have spoken about what has been done and that which needs to be
done, I think we must also briefly refer to the footage itself. That is
what I intend to do now. Honesty and uncovering deception make heroes of us
all. However, selective honesty and the selective divulging of deception
are tantamount to collusion. Questions have been raised around the filming
of the much-publicised video at Grootvlei Prison. The shocking footage was
filmed with the permission of the head of the prison. Having received the
gun which was sold to a prisoner on 12 April 2002, the head of Grootvlei
Prison kept possession of the said gun for over a month without informing
the police, the national commissioner of the police or the national
commissioner of correctional services. The police are also puzzled as to
why police were not involved in setting up the trap for the warders.

Further questions raised include the extent to which the head of the prison
condoned or endorsed certain criminal acts just so that they could be
captured on film. The movement of a juvenile from the head section of the
prison to a particular prison cell without the head's permission is highly
unbelievable. Had he knowledge of the juvenile's movements and intended
purposes thereof? This then begs the question. Was the juvenile sodomised
by the older inmate merely to capture it on film?

The portfolio committee's oversight role has thus become that much bigger
and more determined. We need to assure the public that public safety is our
priority. Enforcement of the law is paramount. The Jali commission is still
tasked with continuing the work in the other six management areas, namely
Ngome, Johannesburg, Pollsmoor, Pretoria, St Albans and Leeukop. The
Department of Correctional Services will continue to build capacity to
respond to and take action in terms of the interim reports of the Jali
commission on these management areas.

I do wish to request, as Mrs Seaton has already done, that the
responsibility of dealing with corruption is not the only area that we as
members of Parliament look at, but that we should look at all areas of
delivery. The first area of delivery that we must not fail to look at is to
make sure that the good policies that we have do not fail, and those good
policies can only be carried out by the women and men who work in
Correctional Services. [Applause.]

Those policies will be good policies if they are implemented and those men
and women in uniform sitting in that gallery and who are sitting behind me,
need to be properly resourced. That is the responsibility of all of us.
Then all of us will feel in our pulse their march and their heartbeat as
they root out corruption in those prisons. [Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Chairperson, I venture to say that the widely broadcast
video showing the shocking events in Grootvlei Prison is a microcosm of the
factual position within Correctional Services as a whole. Sexual abuse of
minors, dealing in prohibited substances such as dagga and Mandrax and the
unlawful selling of firearms and ammunition are all criminal acts to which
a term of imprisonment upon a finding of guilty by a court of law could be
imposed. All these alleged crimes are indicated in the video.

In addition hereto, the smuggling of liquor for the benefit of prisoners
and the indulging by prison warders in liquor in concert with prisoners in
their cells, which prisoners they are supposed to rehabilitate, are all
offences which the disciplinary code of Correctional Services regards as
serious offences.

These offences may be heard by a disciplinary tribunal, which could result
in such members being discharged from Correctional Services. However, it is
ironic that Correctional Services members, appointed and trained to protect
the public from some of the most dangerous convicted criminals in our
prisons, would, in fact, overtly and unashamedly break the laws of the same
institution they are required to uphold.

We had not heard much of the Jali commission before the Grootvlei video
became available. This commission, constituted on 27 September 2001, has
only dealt with two prisons, I believe, being Westville Prison and
Pietermaritzburg Prison. Their reports have not been made available, and it
is only the courageous efforts of four prisoners which has resulted in the
Jali commission rising to such prominence. It was these same prisoners to
which the national commissioner attempted to turn a blind eye. This is
nothing short of a disgrace.

His attempt to indicate to the public, very unconvincingly, that there was
no evidence in terms of which the 22 Correctional Services staff members
could be suspended smacks of a lack of insight into the law and duties for
which he was appointed. His sheer lack of insight and refusal to suspend
those members involved indicates his inability, with respect, to serve in
that position. I associate myself with the remarks made by the hon member
Annelizé van Wyk in this regard early this afternoon.

However, the DP applauds the Minister for deciding to do just that which
the national commissioner failed to do. The taking of statements from those
four prisoners will not only provide more than ample opportunity to have
those warders suspended, but will enable the SA Police Service to have them
arrested on serious criminal charges.

The question is whether he in fact even tried - this is the national
commissioner - to obtain statements from these four prisoners. I venture to
say that he probably did not even consider doing so. The Jali commission in
itself will not resolve the underlying cause of these problems. It is the
combined effect of a failing justice system, a failing police service, and
the resultant effect thereon on Correctional Services which has been
overcrowded by at least 60 000 prisoners. While the present capacity of all
South African prisons is 106 000 prisoners, the latest number of prisoners
appears to be in the region of 172 000. It is thus the criminal system as a
whole which needs attention, not only from the Minister of Correctional
Services but also from the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Development and the Minster of Safety and Security.

Proper budgetary provisions are required to enable each of these Ministries
to fulfil its function properly. More policemen, more experienced
prosecutors, more equipment and proper maintenance of buildings is
required, not grandiose plans. Disciplinary measures should be taken
without fear or favour, and those found guilty should be treated in
accordance with what is required in terms of the law.

What is needed is a national commissioner who would have suspended these
officials and made an example of those prison warders who unashamedly broke
the law. Why is it that the national commissioner, like some of his
predecessors, lacks the willingness to react against such offenders? Is it
because Popcru has become an uncontrollable force which has the ability to
cause the collapse of the whole of Correctional Services should he react
against these members?

It is these questions which need to be answered and the answers to which
the public needs to know. The DA requests all those prisoners and prison
warders who are aware of anyone breaking the law to step forward and bring
the necessary facts to the attention of the Public Protector and all other
relevant institutions. The sooner the Department of Correctional Services
develops a sustainable and clean investigative and disciplinary capacity,
the sooner it will be in a position to combat corruption and crime within
the prison system. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, first I would like to
echo the pleas made by several members who spoke here appealing that we
should not use the incident at Grootvlei to condemn the entire prison
system, because it is our prison system. I think we should not in any way
enforce a siege mentality because it is our prison and we cannot condemn
the entire prison system because of that. I am the first one to admit that
what happened there was very outrageous. It should not have happened.

I would like to begin by quoting from the remarks made by the former vice
president of the United States, Mr Al Gore, when he addressed the Global
Forum on Fighting Corruption: Safeguarding Integrity Among Justice and
Security Officials, in Washington DC on 26 February 1999. He said:


  We are on the eve of a new millennium. As never before, the world's
  people need officials of their governments to serve them with
  unquestioned integrity. Corruption of justice and security officials
  especially betrays their trust. Corruption cannot long coexist with
  democracy and the rule of law. Corruption misallocates resources, hurts
  the poor, and weakens economies and societies. ... we emerge persuaded
  that corruption is not inevitable. It is made by actions of men and
  women. Governments and their peoples can act and can succeed in our
  struggle against it, if only we have the will and the determination to do
  so.

In July 2001 I approached President Mbeki and requested him to appoint a
commission of inquiry into alleged incidents of corruption, crime,
maladministration, violence or intimidation in the Department of
Correctional Services. On 8 August 2001 a commission of inquiry headed by
Judge Thabane Jali, was appointed in terms of the presidential minute,
No.423 of 8 August 2001, to inquire into and report on the alleged
incidents of corruption in the department.

Allow me to put this matter into proper perspective for the benefit of
informed debate on Grootvlei. When I took over as Minister of Correctional
Services in 1998, several groupings, I think people and men of integrity
and individuals within my department, approached me with allegations of
corruption and financial mismanagement directed then against the then
commissioner and other senior officials which, incidentally, had also been
reported in the media.

I then initiated an investigation into the allegations through the Auditor-
General. The findings of the Auditor-General were presented to the Standing
Committee on Public Accounts. Thereafter the department was summoned to
appear before Scopa. This process eventually led to the resignation of the
then commissioner. Because of many unanswered questions still remaining, I
felt that further probing of the department as a whole was necessary.

At this point I literally declared war against corruption in my department,
which was motivated by my conviction and determination to promote a culture
of clean administration and transparency in the department. I subsequently
approached the Minister for the Public Service and Administration for a
possible further inquiry into the department by her own department. This
process led to the establishment of a management audit of my department
which culminated in a report to the President, me and Minister Fraser-
Moleketi, dated 18 February 2000.

In its process, the management audit came across new allegations of
corruption and maladministration. As a result of these further allegations,
I then called for a second phase of the investigation which was conducted
jointly by the Department of the Public Service and Administration - DPSA -
and the Public Service Commission to probe further into these allegations.
The Public Service Commission investigation concentrated on allegations to
do with human resource malpractices, while the DPSA investigation looked
into all the other allegations of impropriety. The reports of these
investigations were submitted to the President and Cabinet.

On 16 March 2001 the DPSA and the Public Service Commission presented their
respective reports to a joint sitting of the Portfolio Committees on Public
Service and Administration and on Correctional Services. While this
investigation assisted in exposing corruption and maladministration in the
department, many questions, however, still remained unanswered owing to
their informal nature. It therefore became necessary to put in place a
proper commission of inquiry with powers to summon and cross examine
witness evidence and, hence, the appointment of the Jali commission. We
have gone ahead to implement some of the recommendations of both the
reports which require immediate action, and we are still doing so.

I am pleased to announce that the Jali commission itself has already made
tremendous progress in uncovering corruption, crime and maladministration.
In fact, the Jali commission has already made significant breakthroughs in
its quest to uncover corruption and crime in the department. The commission
has already completed its work in two of the nine prioritised management
areas, namely Westville and Pietermaritzburg.

Information and evidence led in the Jali commission assisted in the
apprehension and conviction of the departmental officials involved in the
gruesome murder that sent shock waves across the country of Thuthukile
Bhengu, our senior manager of human resources in KwaZulu-Natal.

Similarly, the information coming out of the work of the Jali commission on
the Grootvlei incident must be seen as yet another breakthrough in the
fight against corruption in the department.

I can therefore assure this House that the Government is winning this war
on corruption in our prisons, which I have been waging since 1998. This,
however, must not be misinterpreted to mean that the fight against
corruption in our prisons is nearing completion.

In the South African prison system we are dealing with deeply entrenched
cultures and subcultures - I have always said that - which involve both
prison officials and prisoners. It is a system that mirrors society in many
ways, sometimes defying both the laws of man and the laws of nature.

In this regard, it is necessary that the current corruption in our prison
system is understood within the larger political and socioeconomic context
of our country. We must therefore not view prison in isolation. We must
also not view prison as a symbolic answer to the crisis of control that
exists outside the prison walls. We also have a responsibility as members
in terms of what exists outside the prison walls.

I would like to take this opportunity to draw hon members' attention to the
broader problems and challenges facing my department. As Correctional
Services, we have always been on the receiving end of our criminal justice
system, as people have said. We are currently facing a serious problem of
overcrowding, which is undermining our efforts to comply with international
norms and standards regarding prison management and offender
rehabilitation. As a department, we have therefore concentrated our efforts
on long-term strategic interventions to deal with the challenges facing us.
There are no quick-fix solutions to our problems.

The recently adopted departmental strategic plan clearly shows how the
department intends to allocate resources appropriately, thereby creating
the necessary savings to allow us to shift more resources towards offender
rehabilitation and the improvement of prison management during the current
medium-term expenditure framework period.

The national commissioner has also been tasked to ensure the processing of
the interim recommendations of the Jali commission as it progresses through
the various management areas. This will result in the development of a
sustainable investigative capacity within the department. It is expected
that this internal investigative capacity will be enhanced through the
secondment of experienced forensic investigators from the Scorpions's unit.
We are, indeed, looking at various options, including the possibility of
taking over some of these investigators to establish an effective
anticorruption unit for the Department of Correctional Services.

At this juncture it is important to mention the fact that we have only
budgeted an amount of R8,7 million for the work of the Jali commission,
based on the current nine privatised management areas. What is important to
note ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, I regret your time has
expired.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, I just have a quarter of a page left.
[Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: We will allow the Minister that latitude.

The MINISTER: What is important to note here is the fact that this money
will not allow us to investigate each and every one of the 138 management
areas of the department, hence the need to develop a sustainable internal
investigative capacity.

The success of the transformation of our prison system will be the result
of a joint effort by all stakeholders. I therefore welcome the concerns and
issues raised in this debate, and I will personally make sure that they are
also attended to.

I wish to inform this House that I have decided to embark on a road show,
visiting all provinces to conduct anticorruption workshops. This campaign
will begin with my visit to the Bloemfontein management area on Friday, 28
June. [Applause.] We did this with regard to the escapes and we managed to
bring them down. I hope we will also deal a blow to this scourge.
Let me end by quoting writer G B Caird, from his book Principalities and
Powers: A Study in Pauline Theology:


  As long as the state continues to perform its God-given task even if, in
  other respects, it shares in the general corruption of the present world
  order, it will still possess a divine authority which the Christian must
  obey, not merely from fear of the consequences but also for conscience'
  sake. In other words, it is a Christian duty to keep within the law and
  to refrain from any conduct which will weaken the fabric of society.

With these words, may God bless the House and Correctional Services.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                           GOOD WISHES TO MEMBERS

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, on behalf of the
presiding officers, may I take this opportunity to wish you a restful
winter recess. Travel safely. We look forward to seeing you back here in
August, and I am sure we will be faced with a very interesting Parliament
after the window period has come into effect. [Interjections.] There might
be a lot of excitement to look forward to when we return. Let us wish you
all a very restful recess. Keep warm. The House is therefore adjourned
until 8 August 2002. [Applause.]

The House adjourned at 19:04.
