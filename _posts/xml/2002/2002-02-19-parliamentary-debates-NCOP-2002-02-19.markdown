                            WELCOMING OF MEMBERS

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, good afternoon  and  welcome  back
to the 2002 session of this the second Parliament of South Africa under  the
Constitution of 1996.

I am pleased that so many of the hon members are present in this  particular
House. We even have the hon Mthembu here. Welcome. I am pleased to  announce
that we have a new permanent delegate in the NCOP. I cannot see  whether  Dr
Van Zyl is here. She is not?

The hon Dr A Van  Zyl,  who  represents  the  Western  Cape  province  as  a
permanent delegate, made  and  subscribed  to  the  oath  before  me  on  13
December 2001. I would like, at this moment,  to  take  the  opportunity  to
welcome her in absentia to the NCOP.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek  gee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem dat -


  (1) die Nuwe NP sy dank uitspreek dat die Parlement hom  daartoe  verbind
       het dat die naamborde op die parlementêre terrein in  meer  tale  sal
       wees;


  (2) dit foutiewelik voor die Opening van die Parlement  slegs  in  Engels
       aangebring is;


  (3) na aanleiding van ons versoek aan die Parlement om dit  veeltalig  te

  (4) die hele kwessie op die  eerste  vergadering  van  die  Huishoudelike
       Reëlingskomitee  gehanteer  sal   word,   waarna   die   veranderings
       aangebring sal word; en


  (5) die Parlement hierdeur gewys het dat hy bereid is om  gehoor  te  gee
       aan die grondwetlike vereistes oor taalregte  en  dat  dit  deur  ons
       beskou word as 'n voorloper om ook die webtuiste  van  die  Parlement
       veeltalig te maak en 'n taalbeleid vir die Parlement te finaliseer.

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) the New NP expresses its  gratitude  that  Parliament  has  committed
       itself to displaying the signboards in the parliamentary precinct  in
       more languages;


  (2) these were displayed incorrectly in English only before  the  opening
       of Parliament;


  (3) in response to our request to make them  multilingual,  it  has  been
       confirmed that they will soon be rectified;


  (4) the whole issue will  be  addressed  at  the  first  meeting  of  the
       Internal Arrangements Committee, after  which  the  changes  will  be
       effected; and


  (5) in this way Parliament has shown its willingness  to  adhere  to  the
       constitutional requirements regarding language  rights  and  that  we
       regard  this  as  a  forerunner  to   making   Parliament's   website
       multilingual  as  well  and  finalising   a   language   policy   for
       Parliament.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move  at  the  next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock and dismay the reported  case  of  child  labour  in
       Helderberg in the Western Cape;

       the children work  longer  hours,  which  included  compulsory  snuff
       intake;


  (3) believes that  this  is  indeed  contributing  to  the  psychological
       destruction of the very nerve of our society - children;
  (4) further notes that this is in contravention and in total disregard of
       the labour laws of the country; and


  (5) calls for stricter measures to be taken to  protect  the  rights  and
       welfare of children in our country.

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek by  die  volgende  sitting
sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die deelnemende regering wat tussen die  Nuwe  NP  en
       ANC in die Wes-Kaap tot stand gekom het;

       stemgeregtigdes in die Wes-Kaap verteenwoordig;


  (3) die Premier van die Wes-Kaap, mnr Peter Marais, en  sy  hele  kabinet
       gelukwens met hul doelgerigtheid  om  die  vraagstukke  van  armoede,
       Vigs, werkskepping en misdaad in die Wes-Kaap aan te pak;


  (4) kennis neem dat die nuwe dinamiek wat in die Suid-Afrikaanse politiek
       posgevat het met die  konsep  van  deelnemende  regering  verreikende
       positiewe gevolge vir ons land kan hê en dat dit die  benadering  van
       kantlynpolitiek in Suid-Afrika negeer as uitgedien; en


  (5) ook kennis neem van die Premier van die  Wes-Kaap  se  woorde  in  sy
       openingstoespraak toe hy gesê het:


              History is littered  with  corpses  of  prominent  people  who
              became obsessed with ``what is wrong'' and ``who  was  wrong''
              rather than ``what was right''.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day I shall move:

       politics with the concept of participatory government can  have  far-
       reaching positive consequences for our country and that it rules  out
       the approach of politics from the sidelines in South Africa as  being
       obsolete;


  (5) also notes the Premier of the Western Cape's  words  in  his  opening
       address when he said:


           History is littered with corpses of prominent people who  became
           obsessed with ``what is wrong'' and  ``who  was  wrong''  rather
           than ``what was right''.]

       KwaZulu-Natal;


  (3) hopes that the steps taken are going to save many lives and alleviate

                     CONGESTION PROBLEMS IN DURBAN PORT

  (1) takes note -


       (a)  of the congestion problems in the port of  Durban,  the  busiest
           harbour in Africa;
       (b)  that a  surcharge  of  US$75  on  each  container  imported  and
           exported through the port of Durban which is  delayed  for  more
           than 12 hours  in  the  said  port  had  been  proposed  by  the
           Container Liners Operators Forum (CLOF), but that  it  had  been
           agreed by the said  forum  to  put  a  moratorium  on  the  said

           region; and


  (2) requests the  Minister  for  Public  Enterprises  to  have  the  said
       situation at the port  of  Durban  investigated  immediately  and  to
       furnish this Council as soon as possible with  a  report  as  to  the

                     VOLUNTEERISM IN THE POLICE SERVICE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the ANC has declared 2002 the Year of  the  Volunteer  for
       Reconstruction and Development;


  (2) further notes that the month of February has been declared Safety and
       Security Focus Month, aimed at mobilising  communities  to  volunteer
       their services by joining local community police forums, volunteering
       as police reservists, participating  in  victim  support  programmes,
       helping  in  establishing  and  participating  in  patrol  units  and
       neighbourhood watches to ensure greater policing visibility;


  (3) acknowledges the  eagerness  with  which  the  community  of  Qwaqwa,
       through the local community police forum, has responded to this  call
       by donating bicycles to the police to enhance visible policing in its
       high crime areas;


  (4)  believes  their  response  is  a  worthy  example  of  the  kind  of
       volunteerism we are seeking to achieve; and

       to do the same.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  That the Council -


  (1) conveys its condolences to the families  of  victims  of  a  terrible
       train accident that  took  place  at  KwaDukuza  in  Stanger  when  a

     MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, members of  the  House,  ladies  and
gentlemen, allow me to congratulate the National  Council  of  Provinces  on
organising this debate - which is the first of its kind  -  and  helping  to
break the silence that so often  surrounds  matters  of  sexual  harassment,
sexual abuse and sexual violence.

Women in South Africa, like their counterparts in the  rest  of  the  world,
have been clamouring for years for both the public and the state to  sit  up
and take note of what is happening to women and children.  There  have  been
numerous grass-roots movements and nongovernmental organisations  that  have
worked tirelessly to bring this to our attention. Now  it  is  our  duty  as
public representatives and the state to be conscious of what is happening.

Fortunately, with the advent of  democracy  in  this  country  and  the  new
Constitution that established the rights of everyone to,  I  quote,  ``equal
protection and benefit of the law'', the conditions are beginning to  change
and these matters are now more in the public  domain  than  they  have  ever
been before. Recently a great deal has been  written  about  the  fact  that
sexual harassment and violence are on the increase. While there  is  no  way
we can measure this accurately, what is  clearly  on  the  increase  is  the
recognition that our country now has  laws  and  practices  in  place  which
serve to protect the rights and dignity of women and children. It  is  these
mechanisms that in turn create the space for the victims of  this  abuse  to
report these matters to the relevant state authorities.
However, laws in and of themselves are not enough. These matters need to  be
openly discussed  and  debated  if  we  are  to  realise  and  practise  the
inalienable human rights enshrined in  our  Constitution.  If  the  Bill  of
Rights is to become a living thread in our lives and a part of the warp  and
weft of the social fabric, we must focus on these values which  we  need  to
inculcate in our society  and  which  will  ensure  that  these  rights  are
upheld.

What has been most shocking for many of us has  been  the  extent  to  which
this unacceptable behaviour seems to be prevalent in our schools.  When  the
victims are children, one does not  stop  and  think  of  the  long-standing
history of the phenomenon, but one recoils at the thought that in  some  way
one might have contributed to  one  child  being  hurt,  either  by  keeping
silent on these matters or, indeed, by failing to act  in  ways  that  could
have prevented the abuse and harassment from happening in the first place.

It is true  that  schools  all  over  the  world  face  similar  challenges:
challenges in motivation, self-esteem, discipline, drug abuse  and,  indeed,
sexual violence and harassment. But the prevalence of these in the  rest  of
the world is no reason for us to sit back and relax. We are  not  trying  to
work  out  some  sensational  approach  -  regrettably  there  has  been   a
sensational approach - or treat our country as the worst  possible  culprit.
We cannot measure proportions; one act of violence or harassment is one  too
many. Therefore we have taken into account the fact that we are not  dealing
with the world league of culprits; we are dealing  with  our  own  standards
and our own needs.

Our  children  look  to  us  for  protection,  and  it  is  our   collective
responsibility to protect them and to protect what I  call  their  right  to
innocence. Together we need to create a national consciousness  that  sexual
harassment and violence against our children - boys  and  girls  -  or,  for
that matter, against anyone, is unacceptable, more so because  children  are
a matter of trust for the school system and for the community.
This is unfortunately a very complex social problem in which  there  may  be
no common understanding of what constitutes harassment or  of  the  possible
devastation  of  such  harassment  to   victims.   Sexual   harassment,   by
implication, is behaviour that is hostile or offensive to the  recipient  or
to others and creates an undermining of the  integrity  or  dignity  of  the
individual. Such behaviour can make an individual feel  uncomfortable  -  as
many of us may have felt ourselves - unsafe, frightened or embarrassed,  and
may be physical, verbal or nonverbal.

The common link is that the behaviour is unwanted by the  recipient  and  by
others; it is unwarranted by the  relationship  and  would  be  regarded  as
harassment or bullying by any reasonable person. Every  child  has  inherent
dignity - the  Constitution  strengthens  that.  But  independently  of  the
Constitution, every child has a right to dignity and has the right  to  have
his or her human dignity respected.

A sad fact that  is  coming  out  with  the  increasing  reports  of  sexual
harassment and violence in our schools is that some  of  our  teachers  even
believe that they have  genuine  and  acceptable  relationships  with  these
learners. In some instances  both  the  schools  and  the  families  of  the
learners  condone  these  so-called  relationships  or  refuse  to  make   a
complaint or accept compensation.

Sometimes when this abuse comes to light, there is  an  attempt  to  resolve
the matter behind closed doors. Our society  is  not  different  from  other
societies. We treat sexual abuse as a kind of family skeleton to  be  hidden
away. And, of course, that is not uncommon  in  other  countries  and  other
cultures too. So one offers the family some monetary  compensation  to  make
the problem, as it were, go away.

We need to fight these attempts  to  make  abuse  or  harassment  a  private
matter, something to be hidden from public view. We need to ensure that  the
perpetrators feel the full might of the law and  of  public  disapproval.  I
think that, arising from this debate, we  shall  approach  the  Director  of
Public  Prosecutions  to  ask  whether  it  would  be  possible  to  stop  a
complainant from withdrawing a case of sexual abuse. The right  to  withdraw
a case must rest with the DPP. I see some Unites States  jurisdictions  have
done that. As hon members  know,  one  can  use  pressure  to  have  a  case
withdrawn from court.

Such is the nature of the problem we are faced with. And whilst the  purpose
of this debate  or  indeed  the  other  related  processes  that  have  been
scheduled to deal with this matter should not  sensationalise  this  matter,
we cannot afford, as I have said, to be complacent.

In recognising the need to reclaim and protect the right  to  innocence  for
our children,  the  Ministry  of  Education  has  embarked  on  a  range  of
initiatives to deal with this issue, a number of them in the difficult  area
of changing attitudes and beliefs.

In relation to  learners,  we  have  strengthened  our  focus  on  sexuality
education  and  on  the  Life  Orientation/Life  Skills  Learning  Area   in
Curriculum 2005, so that we can develop in learners the  skills,  knowledge,
values and attitudes necessary for effective and  responsible  participation
in a democratic society. We are hoping to produce a new  breed  of  learners
with not only the skills that are necessary, but  also  the  confidence  and
the attitude to command respect for themselves and from others.

It is unfortunate that there are some who believe - in the Other House,  not
here - that  we  should  not  be  talking  to  our  children  on  issues  of
sexuality. They have even accused us of teaching our  children  pornography.
It is these attitudes  that  sometimes  make  this  issue  so  difficult  to
address successfully. Those who are  attempting  to  frustrate  our  efforts
need to realise that the only way in which to  deal  with  this  scourge  is
through access to  comprehensive  sexuality  education  which  augments  the
education  children  receive  from  their  families,  religious  and   other
communities and health care professionals. But the  primary  duty  regarding
sexuality education vests in the family and others around the children.  The
school supplements this, and I regret to say very often has to do more  than
supplement it because the families fail to do their duty.

The primary goal is to help young people build a foundation as  they  mature
into sexually healthy adults.  Such  programmes  respect  the  diversity  of
values and beliefs represented in the community.  A  recent  American  study
shows that 60% of the schools will use an entire, comprehensive approach  on
sexuality, and 30% will say ``No sex -  abstention''.  It  is  left  to  the
sense of the community values rather than anything imposed.

In November 2000 we also  introduced  an  amendment  to  the  Employment  of
Educators Act of 1998 to make it clear that if a teacher is found guilty  of
having a sexual relationship with a learner at his or her school, even  with
the learner's consent, the teacher will  be  dismissed.  We  are  about  the
first country to do this. Where a teacher is involved in the rape or  sexual
assault of a learner of another school and is found guilty after a  hearing,
such teacher may be dismissed from his or her post.
The intention of the legislation is to  make  it  absolutely  clear  that  a
teacher  who  not  only  sexually  abuses  learners,  but  also  has  sexual
relations with learners because of the power  of  subordination,  should  no
longer be a teacher. It is also for this reason  that  the  SA  Council  for
Educators Act was enacted  to  set  up  this  body,  a  body  that  licenses
teachers. When a teacher is dismissed on the basis  of  sexual  abuse  of  a
learner, he or she will  be  deregistered  as  a  teacher  and  may  not  be
appointed by any person, including private providers,  as  a  teacher.  This
kind of legislative commitment to root out this abhorrent  practice  is  not
common elsewhere in the world.

It is a pity that enforcement still presents us with major  challenges.  The
failure to implement the existing legislation creates  the  impression  that
as leaders we are not committed to ridding the  system  of  the  scourge  of
abuse and harassment. I have already indicated to our  officials  that  this
is an area that I expect them to pay particular attention to this year.
Many would have heard of the 1998 Medical  Research  Council  study  on  the
rape of girls in South Africa recently published in the British Lancet.  The
study claims that teachers commit  a  shocking  33%  of  incidents  of  rape
against children. This was a very  comprehensive  survey.  Unlike  the  NCOP
survey which asked for responses, here was an actual  scientific  survey  of
more than 11 000 people. It is a  very  respectable  and  reputable  way  of
finding out. What we  need  to  be  careful  about  is  not  to  create  the
impression that the majority of our teachers are rapists and abusers.

This debate is important to ensure the integrity of the teaching  profession
and ensure that the profession enjoys  esteem  in  our  community.  We  look
forward to the unions, the  professional  bodies  and  the  SA  Council  for
Educators taking prompt action against the minority who abuse.  This  is  an
issue, therefore, that requires of us to  reflect  seriously  on  how  these
statistics are matched by corresponding evidence  of  disciplinary  measures
taken by ourselves as the department,  the  SA  Council  for  Educators  and
indeed by the teacher unions.

There is in fact very little evidence to  show  that  we  were  successfully
implementing our own disciplinary procedures  and  measures  to  the  extent
indicated in the study and other similar studies. This  was  highlighted  in
the recent NCOP public hearings conducted in the  provinces,  where  it  was
found that cases that had been reported had not  been  acted  upon  or  that
teachers  who  had  allegedly  sexually  abused  learners   had   not   been
disciplined and are still in the same schools. I  will  be  meeting  the  SA
Council for Educators next week to decide exactly what their approach is  to
the sexual misbehaviour of teachers.

In the next couple of weeks I will be  announcing  the  establishment  of  a
special  task  team  that  will  work  very  closely  with  the   provincial
departments of  education,  with  teacher  unions  and  organisations,  with
school governing bodies and associations and with the SACE  to  monitor  the
implementation of various legal and policy  instruments  in  the  system.  A
separate initiative my department embarked  on  was  the  development  of  a
module for schools on managing sexual harassment and gender-based  violence.
This module has already been  piloted  in  three  provinces:  Gauteng,  Free
State and Mpumalanga. It will this year be taken to  all  provinces.  It  is
divided  into  eight  separate  workshops  and  provides  schools  with  the
knowledge and skills needed to deal with  the  different  facets  of  sexual
harassment and violence.

In 2001, together with the SA Police Service, we  completed  a  workbook  on
signposts to safe schools. This workbook, which I commend to the  House  and
is in the library, provides schools with a resource as well as  a  reference
for action to be taken  by  educators,  district  managers,  principals  and
school governing bodies on a whole range of  school-safety-related  matters.
It also  provides  schools  with  strategies  to  improve  the  impact,  the
authority and the efficiency of school management  and  school  services  in
relation to school safety. The workbook is now ready  for  distribution  and
will be sent out to all 27 000 schools in South Africa by April 2002.

Finally, in recognition of the inextricable link between the freeing of  the
potential of girls and ensuring equal access to education, we are  currently
finalising a teachers' manual  on  gender  equity  in  education  to  assist
teachers in creating schools  that  are  friendly  to  girls  too.  It  goes
without saying that no real  learning  in  schools  can  take  place  in  an
environment of fear, neither can the values of the Constitution be  nurtured
in young South Africans in an  environment  where  they  are  being  flouted
daily. It is essential, therefore,  that  we  promote  gender  equality  and
respect for others in schools  and  ensure  that  these  values  inform  and
infuse all work and activities in schools.

In closing, I am reminded of the haunting words of a young child,  Nokwanda,
a student at Acacia Park Primary School, who, when addressing Parliament  in
this very room last year, called on  us  as  politicians  to  do  everything
possible to protect and nurture our childrens' right to dignity and  safety.
This little girl wrote:


  When we go to school, we want to feel safe and not scared. We want to ask
  our teachers questions without fear. We do not want to feel ashamed  when
  we do not understand something. We do not want teachers  to  beat  us  or
  scream at us. We feel safe when there are separate and clean toilets  for
  boys and girls. We feel safe when nobody touches our bodies at school. We
  feel safe when we can run and tell teachers and other adults in school if
  there are people who touch us or beat us. We are  children  and  like  to
  play at break time. All playgrounds  must  be  safe  and  not  dangerous,
  particularly from outsiders. Children must  not  be  beaten  at  schools.
  Girls must not be raped at school or  anywhere.  Gangsterism  must  stop.
  Drugs must stop. Children are the future and they must be protected.

Let us  today  in  this  House,  for  the  first  time  in  our  independent
democratic Parliament, commit ourselves to working together to  ensure  that
these hopes and wishes so eloquently expressed by Nokwanda become a  reality
to all our children. In doing so, I would like to  call  on  this  House  to
make this the focus of Human Rights Day on 21 March and allow  our  children
to reclaim their right to innocence. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  colleagues  from  the
provinces as well as the members of the public, girls in our schools  around
the world are suffering from  intimidating  and  degrading  behaviour.  This
problem has been highlighted in research in countries as  diverse  as  Peru,
Japan and Ethiopia. Sexual violence  against  and  harassment  of  girls  in
South African schools is therefore no exception. However, it  is  a  problem
of  sufficient  magnitude  to  warrant  immediate  attention  from  national
Government, right down to school governing bodies.

Failure on our part to accelerate our response to  this  challenge  now  may
make it even more difficult in future to deal with this problem.

It is common knowledge that children who have been victimised by  others  or
have seen others victimised by violence  can  have  distorted  memories  and
their cognitive functions  can  be  compromised.  Such  children  will  have
difficulty learning in  school  because  their  energies  are  drained  from
defending themselves against others or warding off their fears.

What is even more worrying is that the anger  that  is  often  instilled  in
such  children  is  likely  to  be  incorporated  into   their   personality
structures and can increase their risk for resorting to  violent  action  in
their adult lives. It is no coincidence that many adult child  abusers  have
themselves been subjected to abuse or have witnessed violent abuse in  their
childhood.

How do we meet this challenge  of  creating  a  safe  environment  in  which
schoolchildren can enjoy  their  constitutional  right  to  education?  What
strategies do we implement to creatively respond to this challenge and  stop
this cycle of abuse?

The natural starting point for any  intervention  is  our  schools  and  our
teachers. The school and  its  officials  are  the  one  social  institution
outside the family with which nearly all children have  consistent,  ongoing
contact.

Schools and their teaching staff are entrusted with  the  responsibility  to
act in the place of parents in terms of the common law doctrine of  in  loco
parentis. Therefore  they  are  particularly  well  suited  for  identifying
endangered children, including those who are sexually maltreated.  Moreover,
by acting in the place  of  parents,  schools  have  the  responsibility  to
uphold the constitutional rights to dignity, equality and safety  of  person
of their students.  It  can  hardly  be  argued  that  children  lose  their
constitutional rights  at  the  school  gates.  Standing  in  the  place  of
parents, teachers have a duty, therefore, to  report  all  cases  of  sexual
abuse at their schools. However, there are a number of factors  that  affect
reporting by teachers. As a former teacher, I know that  most  teachers  are
empathetic towards abused children, but fear and a  lack  of  knowledge  may
make them hesitant about reporting abuse.

Another important factor may be  a  lack  of  adequate  training.  This  may
hinder a teacher's ability to recognise sexual abuse  because  many  victims
may not manifest any obvious  external  sign  of  sexual  abuse.  Even  when
sexual abuse is suspected,  it  may  not  always  be  reported  for  reasons
related to maintaining the school's image.

However, the most important reason why cases  of  sexual  abuse  in  schools
continue is that the policies on  sexual  harassment  and  violence  in  our
schools are not spelt out in clear terms. The vagueness of our policy  means
that little consideration has been given by schools to the establishment  of
procedures in terms of which such cases can be  reported  and  investigated.
This vagueness in policy may also have serious legal  implications  for  our
democratic state. By not acting on allegations of sexual  abuse,  a  school,
and by extension our Government, may open itself to civil liability. In  the
United States, there has already been a case where  that  country's  supreme
court has ruled that victims of sexual harassment and other forms of  sexual
discrimination in schools may sue for monetary damage.

If we are to prevent our schools from being  liable  for  not  dealing  with
allegations of sexual abuse, we  need  to  clearly  spell  out  policies  on
sexual violence and harassment in schools and  accompany  them  with  strong
commitment from local educational authorities, strong leadership,  financial
support and clear targets for implementation.

Although most provincial reports on sexual violence  in  schools  provide  a
demeaning indictment of the situation at our schools, we are fortunate  that
real opportunities exist for a change in attitude and  in  the  response  to
gender violence in our schools.

There are a number of indicators of the existence of  this  opportunity  for
real change. The most important indicator is the commitment  of  the  ruling
party to the concept of gender equality in education.  This  commitment  has
found expression in a number of laws relating to gender and education,  most
notably the Employment of Educators Act and the  SA  Council  for  Educators
Act, which make provision for the dismissal of teachers who  sexually  abuse
children.

It is beyond dispute that the  hon  the  Minister  and  his  department  are
striving to  become  more  effective  in  participating  in  preventing  the
problem of sexual abuse in our schools. Although the department should  take
the lead in combating this problem, the prevention of  sexual  violence  and
harassment is a responsibility that must be shared by all of  us.  While  we
are not  likely  to  find  ready-made  lessons  in  textbooks  about  sexual
violence and harassment, we should constantly strive to raise our levels  of
awareness and examine our own behaviour. [Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, let me say that I will be reading this on  behalf
of my colleague the hon Nelson Raju. He is unable to attend this plenary.

The Human Rights Watch produced a book entitled ``Scared of School'' on  the
subject  of  sexual  violence  against  girls  in  South  African   schools.
Disturbed at the findings, the Select Committee on Education embarked  on  a
nationwide tour of the provinces to hold public hearings  to  ascertain  the
authenticity of the report.

Standing committees in all legislatures  were  to  facilitate  these  public
hearings on sexual violence in schools. These  public  hearings  brought  to
the fore incriminating evidence of  high  levels  of  illicit  sexual  abuse
between educators and learners. That the problem exists is beyond debate.

It is not my intention to recite some  of  the  numerous  incidents  whereby
innocent young female learners have fallen prey to unscrupulous and  immoral
educators, including principals in some cases.

Not only the state, but also communities themselves,  must  no  longer  bury
their heads in the sand like ostriches  and  pretend  that  the  problem  of
sexual harassment in our schools does not exist. Responsible action must  be
taken if we are to stem the tide of this unwarranted assault  on  our  moral
integrity as a nation.

First of all, there is a need for the South  African  public  to  understand
that the Constitution and the Bill of Rights place a  high  premium  on  the
human rights of children, and especially girls' rights to education.

For ages, gender bias kept girl children from ever  receiving  education  in
schools. Work and  time-consuming  chores,  early  marriage,  pregnancy  and
poverty kept girls out of schools. And now, when, at long  last,  our  girls
have access to formal schooling,  they  become  vulnerable  and  captive  to
sexual predators like wolves in sheep's clothing.

School management, including educators in conjunction  with  social  workers
and the SAPS, have to become proactive in ensuring  that  schools  are  safe
havens  of  learning  for  our  girls.  The  Education  department  has   an
obligation to put into place  clearly  defined  policy  guidelines  for  the
protection of female learners. Schools should have clear policies on  sexual
abuse in schools. The co-operation of parents in  educating  their  children
in  sexual  abuse  and  its  manifestations  must  be  elicited.   Awareness
campaigns in schools must ensure that no  female  child  is  caught  unaware
when sexual advances are made by teachers.

A well co-ordinated procedure involving  police  services,  social  services
and justice should be developed.  There  is  an  absolute  need  for  easily
available counselling when it becomes necessary.

This is what United Nations  Secretary-General  Kofi  Annan  said,  when  he
launched a ten-year initiative on girls' education in Dakar, Senegal  on  26
April 2000, and I quote:


  Education  is  the  single  most  vital  element  in  combating  poverty,
  empowering women, protecting children  from  hazardous  and  exploitative
  labour and sexual exploitation, promoting human rights and democracy  ...
  Education is the path towards international peace and security.

Let us not sabotage the education of our  girls  by  abusing  and  harassing
them. They need our protection. [Applause.]

Mr S B NGIDI (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon  Minister  and  hon  members,
the documented record of sexual harassment in  schools  indicates  that  the
girl child is more of a victim than  her  boy  counterpart.  This  does  not
exclude boys from victimisation and harassment.

I will not bore the Council with facts and figures. Suffice to say  that  it
is indeed worrying  that  more  than  30%  of  sexual  harassment  acts  are
committed by educators against girl children in our schools. This  state  of
affairs should be reduced in our new-found democracy.

Harassment in schools may be as old as  schools  themselves.  The  increase,
both in commission and reported cases - not all incidents are reported -  is
reason for  concern.  This  may  also  be  indicative  of  a  general  moral
degeneration in  our  society.  Schools  are  a  microcosm  of  the  general
society. The ills which are evident in schools  reflect  the  general  trend
and the direction in which our society is going.

The situation at present is that the sexual abuse and  harassment  of  girls
by both teachers and other  students  is  widespread  throughout  the  whole
country. Cases of rape, assault and  sexual  harassment  of  girls  by  both
teachers and male students are reported. Girls encounter sexual violence  at
schools, where they are also raped in toilets, empty  classrooms,  hallways,
hostels and dormitories. They are  also  fondled,  subjected  to  aggressive
sexual advances and verbally degraded in our schools.

Girls from all levels of society and from all ethnic groups are affected  by
sexual violence. Sexual violence has a profoundly  destabilising  effect  on
the education of girl children, that is, there is a marked deterioration  in
school performance. There is a lack of concentration and  loss  of  interest
in school, and they leave school prior to the  completion  of  their  school
career.

Notwithstanding various legal and statutory frameworks which are  in  place,
I would, however, like to emphasise the  following  for  consideration.  The
Department of Education, also through  its  provincial  departments,  should
develop and adopt national plans which would develop  guidelines  to  manage
all  forms  of  abuse;  implement  appropriate  procedures  with  regard  to
educators who are perpetrators; provide funding for counselling and  medical
services for victims; develop a code of conduct for educators;  and  provide
mechanisms to hold schools accountable for failure to adequately to  respond
to allegations of sexual violence.

Secondly, victims need to be protected from perpetrators. We  need  to  make
reporting compulsory. We need to dismiss, as the  Minister  stated  earlier,
educators who are found guilty of serious misconduct with regard  to  sexual
harassment. Teachers facing allegations of  sexual  misconduct  need  to  be
separated from the learners who are  alleging  such  abuse.  Learners  found
guilty of sexual misconduct against other learners need to be provided  with
guidance and counselling for corrective measures. There should be  a  system
of interdicts and  restraining  orders  enforced  in  schools  in  order  to
protect girl children.

Thirdly, the Department of Education, maybe together with the Department  of
Health, needs to establish facilities to ensure that the  health,  emotional
and physical needs of victims are catered for.

Fourthly, the justice system needs to be improved so that  it  becomes  more
friendly and more protective to victims than is the case right now.

Lastly, the South African Council for Educators and teacher unions in  South
Africa should deny membership to convicted sexual offenders, and be able  to
revoke  the  licences  of  those  educators  found  guilty  either   by   an
administrative or a criminal tribunal of any  form  of  sexual  violence  in
schools. [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, I think perhaps  this  issue  has  been  in  the
media and it has been debated in this House. There is  one  conclusion  that
one actually comes to, and that is that we need to admit  that  there  is  a
great deal of corrosion of our moral fibre in our society,  and  that  there
has to be a national programme of moral regeneration in the entire  country,
because what we see in our schools is actually found  in  other  sectors  in
our community.

We have seen the shocking report by the select committee of the  NCOP.  What
one gets from that report is that, as the Minister  has  said  earlier,  the
state needs to take action. Actually, as far as I am concerned, there is  no
need to debate this issue. We just need to take immediate  action.  We  have
in Zulu an idiom, iva likhishwa ngelinye [inhumanity must be  answered  with
inhumanity]. The perpetrator is  either  unqunywa  umphambili  noma  ubhadla
ejele forever or for a long period.
Talking will not help. Our children at  schools  are  suffering.  The  state
must act, and must act immediately. If the state fails to  act,  the  people
on the ground will actually take the law into their own hands. [Applause.]

Mr J M MTHEMBU (Mpumalanga):  Chairperson,  on  a  point  or  order:  Is  it
parliamentary   to   say   ``unqunywa   umphambili''   in   this    Chamber?
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I will make a ruling. I am calling  on
hon member Nkonyeni, while the table assistants  will  assist  me.  We  will
come back to the hon member's question.

Ms N P NKONYENI (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, first of all, I would like  to
congratulate the hon  the  Minister,  Comrade  Prof  Kader  Asmal,  for  the
detailed report he has just  tabled.  I  would  also  like  to  commend  the
members of the  select  committee  who  visited  provinces  for  the  public
hearings, and also the Human Rights Watch for the report they  have  tabled,
which has provoked the debate that is taking place today.

Sexual violence is rife and has always been, as the Human Rights  Watch  has
indicated, in other provinces and in KwaZulu-Natal as well. Public  hearings
were not  conducted  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  but  the  Human  Rigths  Watch  has
indicated that this scourge is also happening in KwaZulu-Natal,  in  schools
in particular. I would like to  indicate  that  the  hon  the  Minister  has
already responded to most of the things that I was going to  raise,  because
I was not aware of some of the things that the department is already  doing.
For instance, one of my proposals was that every school's  code  of  conduct
should prohibit any form of sexual harassment and sexual  relations  between
a learner and an educator.

Secondly, sex education should  be  introduced  in  schools,  so  that  both
learners and educators are made aware of individuals' sexual rights.

Thirdly, all educators should be empowered with counselling skills.

Fourthly,  the   Department   of   Education,   social   services,   Health,
Correctional Services and the Department of Justice  should  look  into  the
establishment of survivor empowerment centres to deal with cases  of  sexual
abuse, and  also  develop  rehabilitation  programmes  for  perpetrators  of
gender violence.

Tollfree numbers should be provided  for  survivors  of  domestic  violence,
especially in our rural areas, in order to enable them to report  the  cases
without delay.

In conclusion, I would like to commend the hon the Minister because I  heard
him referring to, amongst  others,  signposts  to  safe  schools,  combating
gender violence in schools, gender equity in schools, etc. I would  like  to
urge the hon the Minister and the Department of Education that  they  should
ensure that laws which have been enacted are implemented. Our children  need
to be protected in schools against gender violence. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, I will only make a ruling  after
we have checked whether that was an idiom, and whether  and  how  the  idiom
translates in other languages. [Laughter.]

Mnr J HORNE: Geagte Voorsitter, agb Minister en lede van die Huis,  seksuele
teistering  in  skole  word  dwarsoor  die  wêreld  ervaar,  maar  in  Suid-
Afrikaanse skole het dit 'n wesenlike probleem geword wat daagliks  aan  die
orde van die dag is. Daarom is dit goed dat daar vandag  debat  gevoer  word
oor hierdie ernstige misdryf. Dit dien vermeld te word  dat  daar  reeds  'n
mosie aanvaar is in hierdie Huis met betrekking tot die genoemde probleem.

Die onderrig van 'n kind staan op drie bene. Dit is soos 'n driebeenpot.  As
een van die bene ingee, verloor die pot  sy  balans  en  dit  kan  nie  meer
regopstaan nie. Sodoende loop die pot die gevaar om sy inhoud te verloor.
Die eerste been is die ouers. Hulle lê die fondament van die kind,  en  leer
hom of  haar  die  waardestelsels  in  die  huis.  Dit  beteken  die  eerste
opvoeders met wie die kind in sy lewe kennis maak, is sy  ouers.  Die  ouers
staan  pertinent  as  die  eerste  opvoeders  in  die  kind  se  lewe.   Hul
opvoedingstaak ken geen einde nie, maar is van die wieg tot  die  graf.  Dit
is deurlopend. Daarom kan die rol van die ouers nie oorbeklemtoon word nie.

Die tweede been is die kerk. Daar word die kind geloofswaardes aangeleer  as
deel van sy of haar vorming. Die kerk is onlosmaaklik verbind aan  die  kind
dwarsdeur sy lewe. Daarom kan met reg gevra word:  waarom  is  die  kerk  so
stil terwyl hierdie misdryf astronomiese afmetings aanneem? Berigte  rakende
hierdie misdryf, seksuele teistering, het al  in  verskillende  kerkkoerante
verskyn, maar die kerk het nog niks daaroor gesê nie.

Die derde been is die skool. In die skool word die estetiese, die  mooi,  in
die kind na vore  gebring,  en  word  hy  of  sy  ontwikkel,  gemotiveer  en
geaktiveer om sodoende eendag 'n staanplek in die samelewing te vind.

Die genoemde rolspelers is van kardinale belang, want as een  van  die  drie
nie funksioneer nie, affekteer dit die vorming van die  kind,  met  nadelige
gevolge soos seksuele teistering wat voortydige swangerskappe  in  die  hand
werk. Dus kan ons met reg sê, die rooi ligte flikker in ons skole.

Wat ons vandag hier beleef is dat een  been,  naamlik  die  Departement  van
Onderwys, sy funksie verrig. Ondersoeke is geloods, aanbevelings is  gedoen,
planne  is  gemaak,  probleme  is  geïdentifiseer,  maar  die   ander   twee
rolspelers het nog nie betrokke  geraak  nie.  Die  euwel  gaan  dus  rustig
voort.

Hoewel die departement poog om hierdie misdrywe in  skole  te  neutraliseer,
berus  optrede  nie  alleenlik  by  die  staat   nie,   want   dit   is   'n
gemeenskapsprobleem. Dit versteur die harmonie in gemeenskappe.

Om hierdie misdryf die hoof te bied sal 'n bewusmakingsveldtog geloods  moet
word sodat ouers weer hul primêre verantwoordelikheid ten  opsigte  van  hul
kinders kan  besef,  en  aanvaar.  Kerke  sal  moet  opgeroep  word  om  hul
profetiese rol te vervul om sodoende 'n veilige omgewing vir ons kinders  te
skep en te vestig.

As dit so is, kan die oproep van ons agb President, naamlik  vir  vrywillige
werkers, gestalte kry, sodat ons skole weer 'n ligpunt in  ons  gemeenskappe
kan wees, en dat die skole weer vir ons kinders 'n veilige  hawe  kan  wees,
sodat ons uiteindelik sal kan sê: hierdie skool staan in  die  teken,  sodat
dit met ons kinders goed mag  gaan.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and members of the House,  sexual
harassment in schools is experienced throughout  the  world  today,  but  in
South African schools it has become a substantial problem which  has  become
the order of the day. It  is  therefore  good  that  we  are  debating  this
serious misconduct today. It should be mentioned that a motion  has  already
been accepted in this House with regard to the problem in question.

The education of a child rests on three legs. It is very much like a  three-
legged pot. If one of the legs gives way, the  pot  loses  its  balance  and
cannot stand upright any longer. Consequently the pot faces  the  danger  of
losing its contents.

The first leg is the parents. They lay  the  foundation  of  the  child  and
teach him or her the value systems in the house. This means that  the  first
educators the child meets in his or her life are its  parents.  The  parents
are clearly the first educators in the life of the  child.  Their  education
task knows no end, but is from the cradle to the grave. It is  ongoing.  For
this reason the role of the parents cannot be overemphasised.

The second leg is the church. Here the child is taught religious  values  as
part of his or her moulding. The church is inextricably bound to  the  child
throughout its life. Therefore one could rightly ask: why is the  church  so
quiet while this misconduct is reaching astronomical  proportions?  Articles
regarding this misconduct, sexual harassment,  have  appeared  in  different
church papers, but the church has not said anything about this yet.

The third leg is the school. At school  the  aesthetic,  the  beautiful,  is
brought to the fore in the child and he or she is developed,  motivated  and
activated to take their place in society one day.

The mentioned role-players are of cardinal importance,  because  if  one  of
the three does not function, it affects  the  moulding  of  the  child  with
detrimental consequences such as  sexual  harassment  which  could  lead  to
premature pregnancies. We can therefore rightly say that the red lights  are
flickering in our schools.

What we are experiencing here today is that one leg, namely  the  Department
of  Education,  is  performing  its  function.  Investigations   have   been
launched, recommendations have been made, plans  have  been  made,  problems
have been identified, but the other two role-players  have  not  yet  become
involved. The evil therefore continues untroubled.

Although the department  aims  to  neutralise  these  misdeeds  in  schools,
action does not rest  with  the  state  only,  because  it  is  a  community
problem. It disturbs the harmony in the community.

To stem this misconduct an awareness campaign should  be  launched  so  that
parents can once again realise and accept their  primary  responsibility  in
terms of their children. Churches should be  called  upon  to  fulfil  their
prophetic role and, by so doing, to create and establish a safe  environment
for our children.

If this is so, the call of our hon President, namely for volunteer  workers,
can take shape so that our schools can once again become a beacon  of  light
in our communities and that the schools can once again become a  safe  haven
for our children so that eventually we will be  able  to  say:  this  school
stands  as  an  example,  so  that  it  can  go  well  with  our   children.
[Applause.]]
Mr I SEGALO (Free State): Chairperson, there are four issues that  the  Free
State would like to deal with in relation to sexual violence and  harassment
in the schools, namely: the role of parents, the  role  of  principals,  the
role of  school  governing  bodies  and  the  role  of  the  departments  of
education in the provinces.

It is becoming increasingly clear that if we want to deal with  the  problem
of sexual violence and harassment in  the  schools  successfully,  we  will,
amongst other things, need to work out, at a national level,  an  awareness-
raising programme focused on the parents.

Going through the reports from most of  the  provinces,  one  thing  becomes
clear, and that is that parents of children coming from poor families  often
bless these relationships  or  love  affairs  between  their  daughters  and
teachers. Worse even is that when such  cases  are  reported,  such  parents
either keep silent or defend  perpetrators  by  treating  such  problems  as
family matters.  It  has  also  become  clear  that  in  such  relationships
perpetrators  are  breadwinners,  or  sources  of  income  to  the  affected
families.

It is a well-known fact  that  our  education  system  values  the  role  of
parents in the  school  system,  as  well  as  in  the  education  of  their
children. Maybe we should even go as far as to suggest that action  must  be
taken against such parents, especially in cases where there is evidence.

The role of parents of learners in  this  whole  problem  also  brings  into
focus the role of our school governing bodies. One thing  that  also  became
clear in the Free State was that in almost all cases reported during  public
hearings it was evident that school governing bodies  had  no  knowledge  of
such cases.

Principals also did not even bother to inform members  of  school  governing
bodies, even when such cases  had  become  public  knowledge  during  public
hearings. There was no sense that school governing bodies  of  the  affected
schools were following up on such problems. It is, however,  encouraging  to
see that in some of the  provinces,  as  contained  in  the  report,  school
governing bodies  were  taking  part  to  resolve  such  problems  in  their
schools.

Our province has worked out a plan to  empower  and  capacitate  members  of
school governing bodies so that they will be able to discharge their  duties
and tasks efficiently.  Associations  of  school  governing  bodies  in  our
province have also identified this problem, and they are also  working  hard
to empower their affiliates so that they will be able  to  mobilise  parents
and participate actively in the education of their children.

We cannot leave the role of  principals  and  the  Department  of  Education
behind when we develop solutions to this  problem.  Principals  are  at  the
centre of school organisations. Our experience in the  Free  State  is  that
when one considers schools which perform well, one will always find  strong,
competent  and  effective  managers,  or  principals,   in   such   schools,
principals who are able to take responsibility and  maintain  discipline  in
their schools. Equally so, in schools that do badly, one  will  always  find
principals who do not care, who are lazy and not innovative.

During our public hearings,  it  became  clear  that  some  principals  were
colluding with teachers, or perpetrators, to sweep reported cases under  the
carpet. In some cases principals themselves were  perpetrators.  It  is  our
view that in order to find a solution to the problem of sexual violence  and
harassment in schools, any programme we put in place should  also  focus  on
principals.

Some of the principals do not  even  bother  to  inform  the  Department  of
Education. But in situations where our education  departments  in  provinces
know about such cases,  managers  of  our  departments  and  education  MECS
should be encouraged to take strong action against perpetrators.

It is disturbing to read in reports from other provinces that our  education
departments simply transfer perpetrators to other schools.  That  is  not  a
solution, because the problem is just being transferred to  another  school.
In the Free State our education MEC and the department of education  promise
to follow up on all those cases and take tough action against  perpetrators.
This  morning  I  got  the  information  that  our  department  has  already
suspended some people involved.

We would also like to make some recommendations, as the  Free  State,  which
we think should be taken into account when solutions are  worked  out:  that
the department of education at the provincial level, in  close  co-operation
with the Department of Social Development and the SA Police Service,  should
conduct a further inquiry into this matter;  that  every  school's  code  of
conduct should prohibit  sexual  harassment  and  sexual  relations  between
learners and educators; that sex education be encouraged  so  that  learners
have information about sexual harassment; that provision be made  for  those
who want to volunteer information in camera during future  public  hearings;
that social workers be  appointed  or  visit  schools  regularly  to  detect
tendencies of sexual violence; and  also  that  school  health  services  be
strengthened so that school health nurses visit schools regularly.
In conclusion we would like to express our  gratitude  and  appreciation  to
the leadership of the NCOP and members of the  education  select  committee,
in particular the chairperson, Mr Kgware, and Mr  Raju  for  the  manner  in
which they co-ordinated with our province during the  public  hearings.  The
people of the Free State really appreciated  the  public  hearings  and  the
role of the NCOP, and the people  are,  in  fact,  asking  for  more  public
hearings. [Applause.]

Ms  B  D  CREECY  (Gauteng):  Chairperson,  the  public  hearings  that  the
provinces conducted on sexual harassment have highlighted a serious  problem
in our society, a problem that has flourished in a culture  of  silence  for
many decades, a silence  fuelled  by  social  prejudice  and  pressure  that
prevent principals and school governing bodies from tackling it head on.

The high incidence of rape and  sexual  violence  against  children  in  our
society  has  been  well  documented.  According  to  the  1998  SAPS  Child
Protection Unit statistics,  rape  constitutes  one  third  of  all  serious
crimes against children in our country. The hon  the  Minister  has  already
alluded to the 1998 report that found that one third of  all  child  rapists
were teachers. This does not make all educators rapists. There are  tens  of
thousands of educators that are deeply sickened by the  unethical  behaviour
of a minority of their colleagues.

Teenage boys also play a role in sexual harassment and violence in  schools.
Our public hearings found that they play  a  substantial  role  in  teasing,
harassing and, at times, gang-raping girl students on  school  premises  and
on the way to and from school.

The  effects  of  sexual  violence  and  harassment  on  girl  learners  are
devastating. Apart from the physical  and  psychological  trauma  the  girls
suffer,  there  is  the  spectre  of  unwanted  pregnancies   and   sexually
transmitted diseases including HIV and Aids. Many girls  report  that  after
sexual attacks they are unable to concentrate. They  feel  fear  and  shame.
Some of them are forced to sit in  classrooms  with  their  assailants.  The
result is that many of them drop  out  of  school  long  before  they  reach
matric.

The impact on the school as an institution is  also  devastating.  Conflicts
develop  between  principals  and  educators  and  amongst   educators   and
learners; learners take sides with victims or with perpetrators  and  school
communities are torn apart. Respect  for  authority  and  discipline  breaks
down and the culture of teaching and learning is undermined.

As the hon the Minister has already pointed out, regulations  to  the  South
African Schools Act and the code of ethics of the SA Council  for  Educators
specifically prohibit relationships  between  educators  and  learners.  The
Sasa  regulations  also  prevent  sexual  harassment  and  violence  between
learners.

Yet principals and school governing bodies by and large remain paralysed  in
the face of this problem. One reason for their inaction does lie within  the
incomplete transformation of the criminal justice  system  in  dealing  with
sexual offences, but perhaps as important  are  the  social  prejudices  and
pressures which lead school management to trivialise these offences. In  the
words of one 17-year-old learner:


  I think they, the school administration, don't really know how it affects
  us. Maybe to them it's a big joke, but to me - it is not to me. I was not
  laughing or playing. It really bothers me.

The structures of our society which make boys and  men  dominant  and  girls
and women subordinate create a  culture  of  entitlement.  This  culture  of
entitlement leads some male teachers to exploit their position of trust  and
authority for sexual favours. It causes school management to  turn  a  blind
eye to serious breaches  of  professional  ethics.  It  results  in  parents
failing to support their daughters in the  face  of  abuse  or  agreeing  to
cover up the shame  to  the  family  name  with  fines  or  other  financial
incentives.

The hearings that have taken place so far  have  documented  the  scope  and
nature  of  this  problem.  They  have  also  documented  the   failure   of
educational institutions and authorities to  deal  effectively  with  sexual
abuse in schools. Next month in Gauteng we will hold hearings that focus  on
solutions to this  problem.  We  will  be  engaging  principals,  educators,
students and parents in a  public  debate  on  why  existing  measures  have
failed to stop sexual harassment and violence. We will  be  asking  them  to
consider what steps need to be taken to  help  everyone  concerned  to  have
more confidence in dealing with this matter.

Our committee's preparatory policy research suggests that while  regulations
and protocols exist, these are generic in nature.  They  do  not  spell  out
exactly what sexual violence is or what harassment is. There  is  little  in
the existing law that forces school management  to  follow  regulations  and
protocols. There is no sanction for administrations which  fail  to  protect
girl learners in the first place or refuse to act decisively once they  have
been violated.
I am told that 15 years ago this problem was widespread in British  schools.
It was stopped by making offences and  protocols  clear,  simple  and  user-
friendly and by promoting a culture of zero tolerance  for  sexual  offences
in schools. We look to the hon the Minister and his department to  spearhead
such a campaign so that all girls may enjoy their  right  to  learn  without
fear. [Applause.]

Ms N JAJULA (Eastern Cape): Chairperson,  the  subject  under  debate  today
touches the hearts of the majority in South  Africa.  I  will  not  go  into
details with the reports and  so  on  but  I  need  to  share  the  idea  of
realising the challenge that is facing  South  Africa  today.  It  has  been
happening for some time, but looking  at  the  statistics  attached  to  the
matter we are debating, it appears to be increasing by the day.

The teaching profession, noble as it is, is being penetrated by  people  who
infect the profession with this behaviour. The  most  unfortunate  situation
is that when parents send a child to school, they are sending that child  in
order to build that child to be a future leader of a future  nation  and  to
contribute to the socioeconomic  situation  of  the  country.  But  the  end
product, due to the matter under debate today, is  that  zombies  are  being
created at our schools.

The child that has been frustrated and humiliated - the  Minister  indicated
several actions that are defined under sexual violence  -  dies  immediately
after the act. Therefore that child will never  survive  for  the  next  few
years that lie ahead of him or her.

The situation of sexual violence does not choose  whether  one  is  male  or
female. We visited some schools where the boys were  actually  harrassed  by
teachers at those schools - little boys at the age  of  eight.  As  we  were
talking to them, tears were flowing down their  cheeks.  The  challenge  is:
Where do we get our future leaders as South Africans?

We are faced with a situation where society has denied the child a space  to
survive and the right to grow up as a person. We are challenged, and  it  is
a special challenge to our men in this country. It is  time  they  took  the
lead in actually driving the processes of eradicating this scourge.

It does seem to be focusing on who the ladies  are  that  are  driving  this
process. But the situation has got to be driven by our male counterparts  in
the whole of South Africa. For us, in order to  gain  back  the  values  and
norms of society, we need to stand together  as  South  Africans,  from  all
organisations and all sectors, and find a solution  to  the  situation.  And
the solution is, first, introspection. What is our contribution?  What  have
we done in order to correct the situation, as a person,  father,  mother  or
uncle? This shifts it altogether from the teaching profession and says  that
they are the people,  but  one  must  check  one's  relationship  with  that
teacher. Am I not linked to that person in one  way  or  another?  And  what
have we done in order to correct that person?

The laws and policies from the Department of  Education  are  clear  on  the
situation. But what is more serious and uncomfortable is: Why are those  not
implemented, in order to bring the perpetrators properly to book?  Therefore
I think the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development has got  to
fast-track, to make sure that the law is implemented.

At the same time, the Department of Education is not doing a favour  to  the
victims by suspending the perpetrator. This  is  comfortable  cossetting  of
the person with a comfortable salary,  staying  at  home  and  gaining  more
money, while doing nothing. It is time that we found a way  to  suspend  the
person without pay. [Interjections.] Let the person feel the pain  that  the
victims have suffered for many years.

We have seen as perpetrators  teachers  that  are  knowingly  and  wittingly
infecting these children with HIV-positive blood. What is the  objective  of
doing that? It is killing the nation.

We have seen children who were good, focused science students.  Today,  this
year, on a follow-up visit from the Eastern Cape, they are  not  at  school.
The teachers are sitting at home, comfortable with a comfortable  salary.  I
think it is time we found a way  to  fast-track  the  suspension.  The  ill-
treatment by these people should not be sympathised  with.  And  an  end  to
this should be realised by all of us. The department should ensure  that  in
all institutions under its control, at all levels, the  victims  should  not
be victims of all circumstances at all levels.

They have to be protected, and if anyone  is  found  to  be  protecting  the
perpetrator at the expense of the victim, action must be taken against  that
one as well, because the laws are clear. Therefore it is time  that  we,  as
South  Africans,  together  from  all  sectors,   especially   the   teacher
organisations - some of which are protecting perpetrators at the expense  of
the principals that are reporting these issues - stood together  and  fought
this uncomfortable situation that is being created all over the country  and
restored the dignity and ethics of the teaching professions. [Applause.]

Mr J M MTHEMBU (Mpumalanga): Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  it  is  indeed  a
pleasure for us to be part of this important discussion. We  would  like  to
indicate that we see this problem as a societal one. Indeed,  it  is  not  a
problem that is limited to our schools. Those of  us  who  were  engaged  in
these public hearings have heard of hair-raising stories,  related  by  kids
and members of communities, that, indeed, some people  who  are  fathers  to
some of the children abuse them.

We have heard of instances of uncles abusing their own little ones. We  have
heard of ministers of religious groups abusing  children,  learners  abusing
other learners, workers abusing learners, perhaps because the learners  find
themselves destitute. Indeed, those who think  that  they  have  money  will
then do everything in relation to the bodies of those learners and get  away
with murder.

Therefore, as the Mpumalanga province, we are of the opinion that we  should
not limit our focus to teachers only. That is unfair  because,  indeed,  all
of us, particularly men, seem to be engaged in these  activities.  At  least
99,9% of the harrowing acts we heard about seemed to be perpetrated  by  the
species called men. Very, very few, if any, perpetrators during  our  public
hearings happened to be women. Very few! I am not very sure that there  were
any. Therefore, in our approach to deal with this  matter,  we  must  ensure
that men are part of the solution to this problem.

Indeed, we have called a consultative meeting in Mpumalanga to try and  look
at what it is that has gone amiss with us as a society. We  have  called  on
nongovernmental  organisations,  community-based  organisations,   churches,
professional bodies including the  unions  and  departments,  including  the
Department of Education, to  find  ways  and  means  of  dealing  with  this
matter. We are happy to pronounce that we have come up  with  a  partnership
against all forms of abuse in Mpumalanga - a partnership  not  only  against
the abuse of little kids who are of school-going age, but also  against  the
abuse of women, because, as we have said, the children of  school-going  age
who are abused are from the female species, and indeed, it  is  no  accident
that in later years, when they  are  adult  women  and  mothers,  they  then
continue to suffer the same indignity.

Therefore we have decided to take this whole matter holistically and  accept
that, indeed, there seems to be a problem  with  the  power  relations  that
define males and females, not only in this country, but in the whole  world.
We have to deal effectively with those  power  relations.  We  have  got  to
declare sexual violence a priority crime.

We fully concur with the Minister and everybody else who  says  that  anyone
who sexually violates any person has, indeed, violated the human  rights  of
that person. Therefore, that person should not find it easy to get paid.  He
should not. That person should also not find it  easy  to  get  out  without
first being successfully prosecuted for many,  many  years  and,  indeed  we
should throw the key away.

We are saying that there  should  be  an  integrated  approach  between  the
various departments: the Department of Education on matters  educational  in
relation to the sexual violence;  the  department  that  deals  with  social
welfare; the Department of Justice; and the  department  that  includes  the
police. That interaction should find  concrete  expression  at  a  local  or
municipal level through the  establishment  of  victim-empowerment  centres.
This is because, throughout the length and  the  breadth  of  our  province,
when we went on public hearings  on  this  matter,  there  was  nowhere  for
teachers to go who see kids faced with this problem  and  also  nowhere  get
help and counselling. Indeed,  teachers  who  tried  to  intervene  in  this
matter had their lives threatened by  the  perpetrators.  There  was  nobody
ready to assist them when they were visited at  night  by  the  perpetrators
and when indeed the perpetrators had been thrown to the police.

We are therefore suggesting to the  Minister  and  this  august  House  that
there should be trained teachers who can deal with issues of counselling  in
the schools, because already we  have  identified  this  as  a  problem.  We
should, indeed, at least budget for teachers who will actually be doing  the
counselling, not only of the kids but also of teachers who need  counselling
after trying to assist kids who have been violated.

We therefore suggest also that there should be  a  provincial  and  national
men's indaba at which  this  main  species,  that  is  supposed  to  be  the
perpetrating party, comes together and really relooks at  itself.  Those  of
us who are saying we are not doing this, must then be heard  to  be  saying,
``We are not doing this.'' We must also come  up  with  ways  and  means  of
assisting our kids and assisting our women who get abused almost every day.

We concur with other speakers that all those who are found, particularly  in
the Department of Education, to be engaged  in  these  exercises  of  sexual
abuse, should not be transferred to other schools, as we have found  in  our
province, but should be dismissed. We fully agree and  we  concur  with  the
Minister.

We also suggest that there should be a campaign of sexual  rights  awareness
in the country - a broad campaign that tells us what sexual rights  are  and
how sexual rights relate to the broader context of human rights. Indeed,  in
this regard in our province, we have established a task team  at  provincial
level that will ensure that task teams are formed at district levels and  at
municipal levels to ensure that the communities are galvanised around  these
issues so that the  communities  can  indeed,  as  the  Minister  has  said,
``break the silence on these issues of sexual abuse''.

If we had more time we would have continued, but seeing that  we  have  only
been allocated 10 minutes, we will therefore give  way  to  other  speakers.
[Applause.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Madam Chair, hon Ministers that are here, hon  members,  MECs
and visitors, allow me to begin my speech with a quote  from  a  young  girl
who had just experienced a gruesome act of sexual violence not far from  her
school:


  I survived and yet I wish I had  died.  I  cannot  cope  with  fear,  the
  recurrent nightmares of my life being at risk. I cannot close my eyes  to
  sleep. I am scared if I do I won't see someone trying to creep up on  me.
  So I lie there until I am too exhausted to keep them open.

This is a clear reflection of a shattered soul. It is one girl's story  that
tells the story of  many  other  children  who  have  experienced  the  same
ordeal, who  have  been  innocent  victims  of  sexual  violence,  abuse  or
harassment in our society. This is a cry of an innocent child who  has  been
robbed of her innocence in a brutal way and,  possibly,  who  may  not  live
like a normal girl of her age for she is always in constant fear.

Is this the kind of life we want  for  our  children?  What  can  we  do  as
Government, as leadership, as a nation, as a society, as communities and  as
parents to deal with this kind of unacceptable immoral act which is  on  the
rise, with our children being the victims? Surely, we cannot  sit  back  and
do nothing, hoping that things will change on their own?
Children  at  school  have  been  common  targets  of  violent  sexual  acts
recently. The number of reported cases is escalating to  a  point  at  which
one wonders what is happening in our society. Research conducted  has  shown
that sexual violence at schools  is  on  the  rise,  the  largest  group  of
perpetrators being the teachers.

In my province the following has  been  noted:  Sexually  harassed  learners
drop  out  of  school  to  avoid  embarrassment,  learners  mistrust  school
educators, school authorities fail to  respond  and  learners  think  it  is
acceptable  to  have  sexual  relationships  with  educators.  The  list  is
endless.

When I read the report on sexual violence in my  province,  I  asked  myself
the following questions: Has the moral fibre of our society thinned so  much
that teachers are no longer the parents and protectors of  our  learners  at
schools? Are they no longer guardians of our  children  in  our  absence  as
parents? They have now  become  the  perpetrators  and  predators  of  these
immoral acts.

I have been reminded about the events during  the  1960s  in  a  small  Free
State town called Excelsior, when some  farmers  went  on  the  rampage  and
raped children and female workers on the  farms.  Fearing  being  beaten  or
evicted, they succumbed. The media exposed  this  horror.  Children's  names
and faces appeared in papers, but the names and faces of  the  farmers  were
never mentioned. Some of the  farmers  committed  suicide.  Others  received
light sentences. One 54-year-old claimed to have been enticed by  an  eight-
year-old.

Children are supposed to be protected,  guided  and  taught  the  difference
between what is right and what is wrong. One must give them a chance  to  be
children, and not rob them of their youth and innocence, so  that  they  can
grow up and be responsible adults who will have the  wisdom  to  distinguish
between what is wrong and what is right.

Schools are  supposed  to  serve  a  distinctive  constituency  and  play  a
particular educational and socialising role with respect  to  young  people.
They are supposed to provide the foundation of a general education, as  well
as more  specific  knowledge  and  skills  that  pre-empt  youth.  They  are
supposed to provide for a safe and  secure  environment  for  our  children.
But, recently, the contrary, the opposite is happening.

We have to work together as a  unit,  as  different  political  parties,  as
society at large in dealing with this challenge. We have to  set  in  motion
programmes which aim to protect our children  from  sexual  violence.  These
programmes have to  be  integrated  into  normal  school  curriculums.  They
should be designed to enhance protective measures, targeting  all  forms  of
abuse.

In a recent African-American weekly publication called The Final Call of  22
January 2002, they tested the top ten TV  programmes  that  are  watched  by
African-Americans in the United States. I have distributed  copies  to  some
hon members around here. The irony  of  it  is  that  contrary  to  what  is
happening in South Africa, none of those  people  watch  The  Bold  and  the
Beautiful or Days of Our Lives, and  yet  our  people  stay  glued  to  such
morally degenerate shows. These are the kinds  of  shows  that  mislead  our
youth and confuse them to the  extent  that  they  also  feel  the  need  to
compete with these programmes which show bedroom  life  in  broad  daylight.
These programmes encourage children to mimic what they see on TV, no  matter
how morally misleading those things are.

This is where our positive desire to learn and  be  part  of  the  world  is
cheaply exploited. These shows do not enhance our Africanness. They  deceive
and corrupt our young people by portraying sex as the main  thing  in  life.
Sex is a precious gift from  God  for  consenting  adults  within  marriage.
[Interjections.]

The media is really a good tool to promote moral values. The media can  also
play a vital role in this war against sexual violence and  towards  changing
perceptions about sex and restoring morality in our society. The  media  can
help create awareness, and it is a powerful instrument which can be used  to
fight the degradation of our moral fibre, which makes people  take  sex  for
granted to the point where they do not  see  anything  wrong  with  sexually
violating others, in particular our children. In a nutshell, the mass  media
can  assist  in  setting  the  agenda  for  broad  communitywide  awareness,
promoting  our  dying  values  and  inculcating  respect  for  humanity  and
children's rights.

The children of  today  are  our  future.  They  are  our  present  and  our
tomorrow. If we invest in them, we  are  investing  in  the  future  of  our
society. But if we destroy them, we are  destroying  our  future,  the  very
nerve of our society and we will be to blame. Let  us  value  our  children,
they are the sons and daughters of the soil.  Let  us  love  and  not  abuse
them. It is time we stood up to these teachers and  other  adults,  such  as
paedophiles, and all males who abuse and exploit children. Let  us  rise  up
and be the voice of the  voiceless  children.  Our  actions  of  today  will
impact on how they will learn tomorrow.

These offenders can  change  their  behaviour  and  take  responsibility  by
taking care of the scars they have caused  on  the  lives  of  our  national
treasure.

Abantwana bethu! Izwe lethu! [Our  children!  Our  land!].  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Ms J MASHAMBA (Northern Province): Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon  members
of the House, I am pleased to share our experience of sexual harassment  and
violence in schools as manifest in the Limpopo province. [Interjections.]

My preamble should, however, not be misinterpreted as to mean that I  derive
pleasure  from  learning   about   sexual   offences   perpetrated   against
schoolgirls. On the contrary, my pleasure emanates from the  fact  that  for
the first time the issue of sexual violence in schools has been put high  on
the agenda of important organs such as the NCOP.

Hon members will recall that in July 1999 Minister Kader Asmal announced  in
his call to action nine educational priorities aimed at  the  revitalisation
of the South African education and training system. The  Minister  condemned
the unacceptably high level of violence in general,  and  sexual  harassment
in particular, within our schools.

The challenge that faces  us  as  public  representatives  therefore  is  to
reclaim our schools as centres of peace, tranquillity and  stability,  which
aspects are  preconditions  for  effective  teaching  and  learning.  It  is
commendable that this House has selected sexual violence in  schools  as  an
intervention focus.

One of the reasons school-based sexual violence should be chosen as an  area
of focus is that schools are  the  most  important  institutions  for  youth
development. After the family, the school is  arguably  the  most  important
space for young people to establish relationships, values and the basis  for
future life choices. The school becomes an even more  important  site  as  a
child enters early adolescence and  family  influences  are  challenged  and
diluted by peers and other external factors.

Although there is a significant lack of data  on  this  issue,  there  is  a
generalised perception that  violence  within  schools  is  increasing.  The
current lack of proper safety and  security  measures  within  most  schools
undermines  the  ability  of  schools  to  achieve  their  educational   and
developmental objectives. There is a  general  universal  agreement  amongst
people of all social strata that schools are an important focus  for  social
change.

If schools were effectively transformed, they  could  become  a  significant
shop floor for positive social change, especially in  a  country  like  ours
where in the past schools have been used to perpetuate the obnoxious  system
of  social  injustice,  inferiority  and  superiority   complexes,   racism,
intolerance and all kinds of societal vices one can think of.

Coming back to the situation analysis as it relates to  sexual  violence  in
the Limpopo province, there are  20  sexual  abuse  cases  which  have  been
reported throughout the seven regions of our province. Out of the  20  cases
referred to above, five disciplinary hearings have been  concluded  so  far.
Four educators who were charged with the sexual molestation  of  schoolgirls
have since been dismissed from service, and  we  are  currently  awaiting  a
report on how one of the finalised cases has been resolved or concluded.

In one instance an educator passed away - may  his  soul  rest  in  peace  -
before the case could be finalised. Disciplinary hearings for the  other  14
cases of sexual abuse of learners are  scheduled  to  be  concluded  between
this month and the end of March 2002. We have in all instances ensured  that
the rights of suspects are respected  in  terms  of  the  Constitution,  the
Labour Relations Act and any other  relevant  legislative  framework  and/or
regulations relating to the procedures to be  followed  when  handling  such
cases.

Ukunquma umphambili [castration] should not be the route to go.  We  believe
that a nation of an eye for an eye will only make  our  world  blind.  So  I
would like to say to my brother over  there  that  we  should  not  go  that
route. Let us use the voice of reason.

The cases I have referred to relate to incidents  of  rape  in  the  broader
context of sexual intercourse between male and female  without  the  express
consent of the latter. There are, however, numerous sexual  abuse  incidents
such  as  sexual  intercourse  between  male  adult  educators   and   minor
schoolgirls. In one instance, a 50-year-old principal sexually abused a  12-
year-old Grade 6 primary school girl under  the  guise  that  they  were  in
love.

There are instances in which educators  denigrate  schoolgirls  by  fondling
their breasts, pinching their buttocks, kissing them, etc. More  often  than
not, such cases  are  not  reported  because  our  children  have  not  been
educated on the various forms of sexual abuse  and  their  right  to  report
such abuse to the powers that  be.  We  will  therefore  need  to  go  on  a
vigorous civic education drive to teach our children, parents  and  ordinary
members of the community about their basic human rights as enshrined in  the
Constitution.

The  same  goes  for  sexual  abuse  perpetrated   by   schoolboys   against
schoolgirls. We need to educate schoolboys not to see girls as sex  pets  or
objects of gratification, but rather as their sisters  and  colleagues,  who
are not less life-loving than they are and who are their equals.

Much as one would have liked  to  delve  into  other  categories  of  school
violence, time limitations negate this. However, one may point out  that  in
the  Northern  Province   incidents   of   educators   assaulting   learners
corporally, despite the outlawing of corporal punishment, are rife.  In  the
province we had 12 cases of  violence  in  schools,  ranging  from  corporal
punishment to educators pointing firearms at  learners  and  colleagues.  In
one instance we had an educator shooting and killing a principal.

One widely reported case is the one involving an educator who was  punishing
a learner with a stick when a wooden splinter pierced  the  eye  of  another
learner, and that learner, as we speak today,  has  an  irreparably  damaged
eye. The educator in question has  since  been  dismissed  and  disciplinary
cases against others are under way. I want to say  that  I  was  so  annoyed
when I received an  appeal  from  this  educator,  who  said  that  she  was
appealing because her intention  had  not  been  to  hurt  the  said  child,
because she had been aiming at another child. I dismissed  that  appeal.  It
was senseless.

However, we are the first to admit that  more  often  than  not  cases  have
dragged  on  a  long  time  before  being  finalised.  The  delay   in   the
finalisation of cases has in the main been caused by  understaffing  of  the
labour relations unit at both the provincial  and  regional  level.  I  also
want to say that in some instances one finds that men protect  one  another,
because people who are in labour relations units are  mostly  male.  When  a
case comes and the perpetrator is a man, there is that solidarity, which  is
very unhealthy.

I  am,  however,  pleased  to  announce  that  the  restructuring   of   the
department's organogram has been completed and  the  labour  relations  unit
will receive our top priority in ensuring that cases of the perpetrators  of
these horrible crimes are concluded  expeditiously.  It  must,  however,  be
noted that in all sexual offence cases the suspects are  suspended  as  soon
as formal charges are brought against them.  I  have  indicated  that  there
have been 20 cases reported. This is just the tip of  an  iceberg.  In  most
instances, the sexual abuse of learners ... [Time expired.]

Adv A H GAUM (Western Cape): Chairperson, the prevalence and extreme  nature
of sexual abuse and sexual harassment of children have  over  the  last  few
months sent shockwaves throughout our country and left us with  a  sense  of
disbelief, anger and numbness. One of the most beautiful things in life  has
become one of the ugliest symptoms of a sick society. One can  only  imagine
the damage done to children who are exposed to these  destructive  elements.
Recently, shocking statistics  for  2001  were  made  public  by  the  Child
Protection Unit of the SAPS, demonstrating the destructive effect  of  child
abuse with regard to distorting the  social  and  emotional  development  of
children.

Judging from these statistics, the tendency for children to  direct  violent
acts, including sexual abuse and sexual harassment, onto other  children  is
prevalent and escalating. For various reasons, victims of child abuse  often
say nothing about what has been or is being done to them but  simply  suffer
in silence. Therefore, putting a stop to  child  abuse,  and  in  particular
sexual  abuse  and  sexual  harassment  of  children,  requires  everybody's
purposeful action.

The protection of children  is  not  the  responsibility  of  statutory  and
formal welfare organisations only, but the legal duty of every citizen.  All
of us  must  accept  joint  responsibility  for  our  children.  Are  people
responsive to the more serious acts of sexual  abuse  as  we  have  recently
seen in news reports, ignoring other forms of  this  problem,  or  are  they
just ignorant? Should not everyone be informed about and  sensitive  to  all
forms of sexual harassment and put a stop to  it,  where  initial  signs  of
sexual harassment emerge?

To address the problem, everyone concerned should  be  well  informed  about
how to deal effectively with incidents and be  enabled  to  identify  sexual
harassment in its various forms of unwanted physical,  verbal  or  nonverbal
conduct of a sexual nature. My department has undoubtedly the vital role  of
addressing all forms of sexual abuse and sexual violence.

The issues of sexuality and sexual abuse  are  addressed  in  various  ways.
Firstly, life orientation is a compulsory and examinable  learning  area  in
the new curriculum. All schools must offer this learning area  and  we  will
see to it that it  is  implemented.  It  is  important  to  understand  that
sexuality and sexual harassment are not matters  that  should  be  seen  and
dealt with in isolation. They  form  part  of  the  total  life  experience.
Programmes  that  deal  with  this  issue  will  have  to  take  this   into
consideration.

This programme addresses the development of life skills but  also  sexuality
education, including sexual harassment and sexual  abuse  in  general.  Over
and above  this,  these  problems  are  also  dealt  with  in  the  HIV/Aids
programme in our schools on which we will spend  approximately  R11  million
in the next financial year. Over and above the formal  education  programmes
that  are  directed  at  this  serious  issue,  educators,  school   medical
personnel and social workers are required by law  to  respond  to  signs  of
child abuse in terms of section 15 of the Child Care Amendment Act of  1996.
To this end, the Western  Cape  education  department  and  other  concerned
parties have compiled a policy document called, ``Abuse No  More'',  dealing
effectively with child abuse. The document provides  guidelines  on  how  to
deal properly and effectively with incidents  of  child  abuse  and  how  to
protect the rights of learners,  particularly  their  right  to  safety  and
personal security. A copy of this document, a summary of it and  a  training
video  were  distributed  in  all  the  institutions  of  the  Western  Cape
department.

An awareness campaign was launched by the end of 2001  and  by  20  February
2002 parents, governing bodies and educators will  have  been  informed  and
sensitised with regard to this policy. Training is  ongoing  to  ensure  the
effective implementation of the specified reporting and  managing  procedure
in dealing with instances of child abuse. The  policy  document  distributed
to schools addresses  the  following:  how  to  identify  child  abuse,  the
management  of  suspected  abuse,  dealing  with  disclosure,  dealing  with
alleged offenders and intervention.

Artikel 17 van die Wet op die Indiensneming van Opvoeders, Wet 76 van  1998,
maak dit uiters duidelik dat opvoeders wat skuldig bevind word aan  seksuele
misdrywe, uit diens ontslaan moet word. Die  Wes-Kaapse  onderwysdepartement
is daartoe verbind om hierdie reëls streng toe te pas  en  om  'n  duidelike
boodskap uit te stuur aan al ons opvoeders. Daar is nie plek  in  ons  skole
vir seksuele teisteraars, molesteerders en verkragters nie.

Dit is egter noodsaaklik vir die effektiewe hantering van seksuele  misbruik
dat 'n multidissiplinêre benadering ingestel word, waar  die  gemeenskap  en
ander departemente, sowel as  individue,  betrokke  is  in  die  proses  van
identifisering, verwysing, ondersteuning en  intervensie.  'n  Doeltreffende
strategie  behels  ook  'n  stelsel  van  gesamentlike  aanspreeklikheid  en
verantwoordelikheid op inligtingsvlak  en  op  distriksvlak  om  klagtes  en
insidente van kindermisbruik te monitor en te ondersoek.

My  department  beskou  die  beleidsdokument,  ``Stop   Misbruik''   as   'n
belangrike instrument in die bestryding van kindermisbruik. Ons sien  daarna
uit om in vennootskap met ouers, onderwysers en  ander  rolspelers  saam  te
werk om hierdie euwel te bekamp, en om 'n omgewing wat  veilig  en  vry  van
seksuele teistering is vir al ons kinders te verseker.

In hierdie opsig wil ek graag vandag die  prinsipaal  van  Nomsa  Maponqwana
Primary, mev Tywakadi, uitsonder en  loof  vir  haar  uiters  effektiewe  en
vinnige optrede na aanleiding van 'n beweerde oortreding  van  een  van  die
onderwysers by  haar  skool.  Die  persoon  is  onmiddellik  geskors  en  'n
ondersoek na die voorval is gelas.

Ons kan eenvoudig nie meer tyd verspil om hierdie euwel uit te roei nie,  en
oortreders kan geen simpatie te wagte wees nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Section 17 of the Employment of Educators Act, Act 76  of  1998,  makes  it
very clear that educators who are found guilty of sexual  offences  must  be
dismissed. The Western Cape education department is committed to the  strict
application of these rules and to sending out a clear  message  to  all  our
educators. There is no room in our schools for  people  who  are  guilty  of
sexual harassment, molestation and rape.

However, it is essential for the effective handling of sexual abuse  that  a
multidisciplinary  approach  be  adopted,  where  the  community  and  other
departments, as  well  as  individuals,  are  involved  in  the  process  of
identification, referral, support and intervention.  An  efficient  strategy
also entails a system of  joint  accountability  and  responsibility  at  an
informational and the district level so that  complaints  and  incidents  of
child abuse can be monitored and investigated.

My department regards the policy document ``Abuse No More'' as an  important
instrument in combating child abuse. We look forward to  collaborating  with
parents, teachers and other role-players in fighting this  scourge,  and  to
ensuring an environment that is safe and free  from  sexual  harassment  for
all our children.

In this respect I today wish to single  out  and  praise  the  principal  of
Nomsa Maponqwana Primary, Mrs Tywakadi, for her most  effective  and  speedy
action on account of an alleged transgression by one of the teachers at  her
school. The person was suspended immediately and an investigation  into  the
incident was launched.

We simply cannot waste  any  more  time  in  eradicating  this  scourge  and
offenders cannot expect any sympathy.]

Every single person who deals with our children should  know  that  if  they
abuse, misuse or violate our children, we shall track them  down  and  bring
them to book. They should be warned that we shall regard an  attack  on  our
innocent children as an attack on all of us. We have no patience left.  They
should change their ways or face the full force of the law.  We  are  united
in our common purpose to remove this evil from our society. [Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members of this House,  there
is no doubt in our mind as a select committee that sexual violence and  rape
do occur in our schools far too frequently for us to ignore. It seems to  us
that this problem has been there for a long time,  as  other  speakers  have
already  mentioned.  The  problem  is  that  it  has  either  been  ignored,
underreported or even reported as something on the periphery that  does  not
need any attention.

As a country, we can no longer be lukewarm to this festering cancer that  is
corroding our society. It has to be  tackled  head-on,  if  we  are  serious
about realising the ideals we set ourselves  in  the  Constitution  in  this
country, particularly in the chapter that deals with  the  Bill  of  Rights.
For if we fail to protect our children in schools,  history  will  judge  us
harshly.

This means, therefore, that all of us need to review what our resources  are
in schools  -  school  governing  bodies,  teachers  and  everybody  who  is
directly or indirectly involved with the education of our  children  -  with
the aim of sorting out this problem.

As the ANC and other progressive forces in  this  country,  we  fought  very
hard against the apartheid education system in order to  put  in  place  the
type of education envisaged in the Freedom Charter. Some had to  go  through
the valley of the shadow of death for us to realise that type  of  education
which will mould our children  to  be  balanced  future  citizens  who  will
positively contribute to the wellbeing of this nation.

It seems to us that we now have to fight with equal vigour  for  the  rights
of our children to be safe from sexual violence in schools.

We must hasten to say, as others have  already  indicated,  that  there  are
very many good educators  out  there  whose  morals  and  values  cannot  be
questioned. But there is also a  group  of  educators  -  a  tiny  minority,
though - who are guilty of this offence and nothing is done to them  because
violence and threats of  violence  are  used  to  intimidate  children  into
silence. They abuse their status and authority in  schools  to  ensure  that
abuse is unreported.

The Employment of Educators Act passed in 1998 outlines the conduct  of  all
educators. This Act mentions specifically, in section 17(1)(b)  that  sexual
violence in schools is regarded as a serious offence  which  might  lead  to
dismissal, as the Minister has  indicated.  Unfortunately,  this  clause  is
seldom invoked, as the public hearings  have  shown.  The  case  of  Ndabeni
Secondary School in the Eastern Cape and many others prove this.

In 1975, when I left college to join the teaching fraternity, I was told  by
my tutors then that teaching was a noble profession - in  fact,  a  calling;
that not every Tom, Dick and Harry can become a teacher. They also  told  me
that one has to have morals and morale that are beyond reproach to become  a
teacher. In some instances it does seem that some teachers  -  few  as  they
may be - will not pass this test. It seems that from time  to  time  we  get
one or two rotten potatoes filtering through  and  joining  those  in  whose
hands we entrust the education of our children.

Jean Jacques Rousseau, an educationist, said that a child is born  a  tabula
rasa - that is, the mind of a child at birth is  like  a  clean  slate,  and
what we do and say will then be imprinted onto the mind of  the  child.  The
same can be said about a child who goes to  school.  That  child's  mind  or
brain is relatively like a blank slate. Whatever the teacher does  or  says,
good or bad, is imprinted on  the  mind  of  the  child.  We  as  a  nation,
therefore, have a duty to protect our children. School governing bodies  and
management structures  can  and  must  play  a  vital  role  in  creating  a
protective environment, especially when it comes to reporting the crime.

According to Human Rights Watch,  counsellors  assisting  child  victims  of
sexual abuse maintain that the manner in which girls are  treated,  after  a
rape or sexual  assault,  by  teachers,  school  officials  or  even  family
members is the reason why most attacks are unreported. Clearly, the  victims
need to be handled with extra care, sensitivity and compassion if we do  not
want victims to withdraw themselves.

The question of safety in our schools cannot be overemphasised.  The  report
from the public hearings states in no uncertain terms the dire need to  have
proper safety measures in place in schools to  ensure  that  the  safety  of
children is guaranteed. We must call upon all  educators,  students  through
learner representative bodies, SGBs and  all  communities  to  engage  in  a
rigorous and vigorous campaign to ensure safety in schools.

In conclusion, as the ANC, we are committed to what we said in 1955  in  the
Freedom Charter, as we said before, namely that the doors  of  learning  and
culture shall be opened to all. Amongst other things, we meant  that  school
buildings and school grounds would be free from  intimidation  and  violence
of whatever nature. We meant that these places would be conducive to  proper
teaching and learning. In this year of the volunteer, we want to  call  upon
all communities to help form democratic structures in  the  communities  and
in schools. These structures will be friendly to all and will enable  abused
students to break the silence. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION:  Chairperson,  I  am  due  in  the  other  House,
actually, to close the debate on education. I would like to have  spoken  at
greater length here.

Can I say that it was a very thoughtful debate and, I think, a very  serious
debate, not just because the  topic  required  it  but  because  there  were
people who were speaking from their own sense of shock  and  amazement.  But
let us begin the basis, however unpleasant it may be, that  we  have  failed
our children. I like - now that he is on our side - Andre Gaum's  propaganda
on what they are doing in the Western Cape, but it still remains  propaganda
at that level.

We have failed our children. We have become an acquisitive and cold  society
based on instant gratification, whether sexual or material. We  have  failed
because we have lost the sense of  compassion,  the  sense  that  drove  us,
through the whole liberation struggle, of solidarity, of refusal  to  accept
any form of oppression. So it is my point of view, that we have  failed  our
kids. We have failed the most vulnerable people in our society, and that  is
why it is very important that  these  debates  should  be  held  everywhere,
because they are part of consciousness-raising. It is  not  good  enough  to
have them here in the NCOP; we have to have them in  the  provinces.  It  is
the provinces that are going to  implement  those  wonderful  laws  that  we
have. The provinces will take disciplinary action and suspend  them  without
pay, because the law allows that, and not suspension, as in one case in  the
North West, for two or three years. These are instant hearings. It is a  law
that encourages people to also sue the transgressor  for  remedies  for  the
violation of integrity. Of course, one cannot wait for the criminal law.  We
must make sure, in fact, that disciplinary action is  taken  for  breach  of
contract at the provincial level and by the SA Council for  Educators.  This
will, in fact, revive faith in  the  teaching  profession.  It  will  revive
faith in the profession itself as guardian.

I am sure I do  not  agree  with  the  chairperson  that  the  school  is  a
microcosm of our general society. That  would,  in  fact,  be  an  appalling
thing. Our general society, as I  said,  is  acquisitive,  it  is  based  on
decadent aspects of living, and in many cases the morality and  ethics  come
from Big Brother for example, where  there  is  very  little  said  for  our
schools. So our schools are not a microcosm. As somebody said,  our  schools
are loving places. They ought to be loving places. If they were to become  a
microcosm of society outside, then many of us would  stop  our  interest  in
education altogether.

We want to build up the schools so that they are places of love,  compassion
and that kind of idealism that does allow young people to grow and develop.

The third point is that some existing customs have to be opposed.  Virginity
tests, which have a sexual  undertone,  are  humiliating.  These  tests  are
obscene in my view, in the same way  as  initiation  ceremonies,  which  the
national  Council  of  Education  Ministers  yesterday  proposed  should  be
banned. All initiation ceremonies, in my view, have a sexual undertone.

Thirdly, we have to recognise that we are a patriarchal society. My  brother
Kgware, the chairperson of  the  select  committee,  asked:  Why  does  this
continue? Partly because we are mostly  a  patriarchal  society.  The  value
judgments are, in fact, raised, determined, succoured and assisted  by  male
and masculine positions, and therefore one of the practices we must stop  is
the right of so-called young men to  prove  the  fertility  of  women.  What
happens there, where it is through rape or consent,  is  that  the  life  of
that young person is destroyed altogether;  remember  that.  Schooling  goes
out of the window, and everything else, with repudiation by family.  Consent
has nothing to do with it. We call it statutory rape if one has  intercourse
with someone under the age of 16, I think. In fact, it is  always  statutory
rape, because men, acting out of patriarchy, have  expectations,  and  their
expectations  have  to  be  met,  and  therefore   we   have   this   rather
extraordinary situation.

We must oppose that as we oppose initiation ceremonies, and  of  course  the
extraordinary amount of alcohol that is drunk  by  young  people  encourages
this kind of behaviour, particularly by men. The cold society that  we  live
in is a society which needs a little bit of  values  which  are  gentle  and
loving. I say this because there are various other things that I could  have
said about what we  are  doing  now,  particularly  consultations  with  the
teacher unions and school governing bodies. We started  on  this  maybe  two
years ago. But as I said, we started on this  because  we  have  failed  our
pupils. But now we must redeem ourselves. By redeeming  ourselves,  we  will
redeem the most vulnerable in our society.

Remember what a wonderful man said once? ``Suffer little  children  to  come
unto me.'' A great man said that, and it stood for all those values that  we
want in our society, of  justice  and  all  the  other  things.  I  want  to
respond, therefore, to some remarkable contributions made by  Mr  Horne  and
others, who may not come from my own  political  tradition,  but  I  do  not
think political traditions are as important here as one's ethical  position.
-``Suffer little children to come unto me'' is something that  should  guide
everything we do. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 16:46.

1.    The Minister for the Public Service and Administration:


     Written Explanation, dated 6 December 2001, from the Minister  for  the
     Public Service and Administration in terms of section 65(2)(a)  of  the
     Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1  of  1999),  setting  out
     reasons why  the  Annual  Report  and  Financial  Statements  of  State
     Information Technology Agency for 2000-2001  could  not  be  tabled  in
     time:
     Dear Dr Frene Ginwala


     DELAYED SUBMISSION OF STATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGENCY (SITA) ANNUAL
     REPORT 2000/2001 FINANCIAL YEAR


     With reference to the above, the State  Information  Technology  Agency
     (SITA) has not been able to timeously submit its Annual Report for  the
     2000/2001 Financial Year because of the following reasons:


     - Delays in the finalisation of the content of the  report,  especially
         by external auditors. The Report was kept for at  least  two  weeks
         by each of the external auditors (PWC and MSGM), working on  behalf
         of the Auditor-General's Office.
     -  The  Auditor-General  took  three  weeks  with  the  report   before
         authorising SITA to go ahead with its final printing.
     - These delays outlined above, resulted in SITA not being able to  meet
         printer's deadlines.
     However, the Annual Report has been  printed  and  will  be  tabled  to
     Parliament on 7 December 2001.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on  Defence  on  the  Joint
     Investigation Report into the Strategic Defence  Procurement  Packages,
     dated 5 December 2001:


         The Joint Standing Committee  on  Defence,  having  considered  the
         matters  in  the  Report  falling  within  the  parameters  of  its
         portfolio, in particular Chapters 3-7  and  10-12,  and  having  to
         report on the relevant findings and recommendations by  6  December
         2001 (ATC No 153, p 1441), reports as follows:


         A. Introduction


              On 15 November 2001, the Joint Investigative  Team  (hereafter
              the Agencies),  which  investigated  certain  aspects  of  the
              Strategic  Defence   Packages,   presented   its   report   to
              Parliament. Although aspects of the  investigation  are  still
              under way, the Agencies managed to complete most of the  tasks
              within its mandate. We note the findings  of  the  Report  and
              congratulate the Agencies for  their  work  in  compiling  the
              Report.


              This  Report  of  the  Committee  strives  to  make   concrete
              suggestions regarding the following:


              1.  Identifying the key strategic issues raised in the Report,
                  which require consideration by both the executive and  the
                  parliamentary committees on defence.


              2.  Making various  process  recommendations  as  to  how  the
                  findings of the Report can be taken forward.


         B. Role of Parliament


              According to the Defence Review (chapter on Acquisition),  the
              Committee has a key role  in  monitoring  and  overseeing  the
              Ministry of Defence, Armscor and  the  Department  of  Defence
              (DoD)  on  any  acquisition  process.  This  role  should   be
              strengthened through the institution of  appropriate  Standard
              Operating  Procedures  between  the   relevant   parliamentary
              committees  on  defence  and  the   Ministry   regarding   the
              management of any acquisition process.


              The rationale for involving the  parliamentary  committees  on
              defence in these decisions is as follows:


              1.  All major procurement programmes are capital-intensive  by
                  nature  and,  as  such,  require   substantial   financial
                  outlays from the fiscus. Parliament approves  the  defence
                  budget and therefore has an interest in ensuring that  any
                  financial outlays are managed according to the budget.
              2.  The mandate of the parliamentary committees on defence  is
                  to provide oversight over the  key  policy  processes  and
                  developments within both Armscor and the DoD, and as  such
                  any  acquisition  project  represents   a   major   policy
                  position for both Armscor and the DoD.


              3.   All  major  procurement  programmes   are   fundamentally
                  strategic  by  nature,  and  as  such  the   parliamentary
                  committees on defence have  a  responsibility  to  oversee
                  both Armscor and the DoD on the strategic implications  of
                  such packages.


              4.  Sub-optimal equipment will not  only  affect  the  SANDF's
                  combat-readiness, but also  the  lives  of  those  persons
                  operating such equipment. Parliament and  its  committees,
                  as  the  political  custodians  of  the  national  defence
                  function, have a moral and a political  responsibility  to
                  ensure that all acquisition  purchases  conform  to  basic
                  operational and security standards.


                  The parliamentary committees on  defence  should  play  an
                  important role in advising the Ministry, Armscor  and  the
                  DoD on the strategic aspects  of  such  packages  and  the
                  political  sensitivity  of  any  proposed  purchases.   To
                  perform these tasks adequately, it is  critical  that  the
                  parliamentary committees  on  defence  in  particular  and
                  other related parliamentary committees in  general  should
                  develop the necessary capacity and planning schedules  and
                  receive  the  necessary  resources  to  acquit  themselves
                  capably.


         C. Security clearance


              The status of security clearances within both Armscor and  the
              DoD needs to be investigated as a matter of  urgency.  Updates
              of existing security clearances and  vetting  of  non-security
              cleared personnel need to be effected as a matter of priority.


              In cases where there  was  a  breach  of  security  directives
              and/or  legislation  in  the  defence   procurement   process,
              necessary steps needs to be taken.


         D. Record-keeping


              Control over internal Armscor and DoD documentation and record-
              keeping  needs  to  be  improved  in  accordance  with   those
              procedures governing the control of classified information  as
              set out by the counter-intelligence function of  the  DoD.  An
              audit trail of all processes linked to  procurement  processes
              needs to be maintained and managed at all times.


         E. Acquisition policy


              Current Armscor and DoD procurement policy compares favourably
              with previous procurement policies that pertained within  both
              Armscor and the DoD in the past. Aspects  of  the  procurement
              policy do need to be fine-tuned,  and  personnel  within  both
              Armscor and the DoD  need  to  be  made  conversant  with  the
              content and the importance of this policy. This  will  require
              the institution of appropriate training and workshops, as well
              as Standard Operating Procedures within Armscor and  the  DoD,
              to ensure that this is accomplished.


              Each phase of the  procurement  process  should  be  concluded
              according to policy prescripts before proceeding to  the  next
              phase. Furthermore, proper authorisation should be obtained at
              each  phase  before  continuing.  Such  authorisations  should
              determine whether the next phase is embarked upon.


              Considerations such as the strategic  objectives  of  the  DoD
              that impact on the procurement process, should be weighted and
              form part of  the  value  system.  It  must  then  be  applied
              consistently throughout the process.


              Future defence procurement  packages  need  to  be  critically
              assessed against the needs of the current strategic and global
              environment.


              The Defence Review states that procurement should, as  far  as
              possible, attempt  to  make  use  of  local  defence  industry
              capabilities.  The   Report   notes   that   foreign   defence
              capabilities were privileged over domestic  capabilities.  The
              parliamentary committees believe that this situation needs  to
              be  avoided  if  local  defence  capabilities,  an  undisputed
              national strategic asset, are to be maintained.


         F. Armscor Act


              A Work Group that had to deal with the drafting of the Armscor
              Act, was established by the Ministry  of  Defence  in  January
              2000. We are concerned that there was not sufficient  feedback
              to Parliament. This should be  attended  to  as  a  matter  of
              urgency, given certain observations by the Agencies.


              The role of Armscor and the DoD with regard to  subcontracting
              needs to be clarified. We understand in the Report that it  is
              not the policy of  Armscor  and  the  DoD  to  interfere  with
              subcontractors, yet numerous  instances  of  interference  are
              mentioned. Whilst Armscor has  the  right  to  interfere  with
              subcontracting,  it  must  do  so  within  the  framework   of
              government policies vis-á-vis affirmative  procurement,  black
              empowerment and technical and strategic needs.


              Armscor as the procurement agency of the DoD, as  mandated  by
              law, should resume this responsibility when the  DoD  procures
              defence equipment.


         G. Cheetah fighters


              The Report observes that the SAAF indicated  the  lifespan  of
              the Cheetah fighters to be up to around 2012. What will be the
              position of the Cheetah in the light of the acquisition of the
              Gripens?


         H. Implications for SAAF's operational budget
              The Chief of the SAAF allowed the amount of R176 million to be
              deducted from the budget  of  the  SAAF,  notwithstanding  his
              awareness of the 30% shortfall with regard to the readiness of
              the Air Force. We will need to be briefed on this  aspect,  in
              particular with regard to the impact on the  total  budget  of
              the SANDF.


         I. Structures


              We note with concern a plethora of structures  and  committees
              involved in the acquisition process. We refer, inter alia,  to
              PCB, SOFCOM,  JPT,  IONT,  AAB,  AACB,  Technical  Team,  etc.
              Furthermore, we observe the following  with  regard  to  these
              structures:


              1.  Individuals occupying a number of positions, thus blurring
                 the lines of accountability and authority.


              2.  A lack of race and/or gender balance.


              3.  People are given incompatible functions to perform.


         J. Conflict of interest


              The issue relating to Conflict of Interest needs to  be  dealt
              with resolutely and decisively within the  public  service  in
              general and by both the DoD and Armscor  in  particular.  This
              will  require  institution  and/or  amendment  of  appropriate
              legislation to govern and control the  activities  of  serving
              public servants. Persons named in the Report  as  having  been
              involved  in  a  Conflict  of  Interest  and/or   engaged   in
              activities deemed unprofessional from the perspective  of  the
              procurement process, should be debarred from  service  in  any
              civil service or parastatal.
              The Chief of Acquisition occupied a position of Chief Director
              within the DoD. Given the fundamentally  political  nature  of
              procurement, it is felt that a person at that level should not
              have been given such incompatible function  to  perform.  This
              also  applies  to  other  officials  from,  for  example,  the
              Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). It  is  felt  that  in
              future  a  person  with  more  political   and   institutional
              seniority should manage such processes.


              Real and apparent conflict  of  interest  did  emerge  between
              various senior officials of  the  DoD,  Armscor  and  the  DTI
              (particularly  those  directly  involved  in  the  acquisition
              packages) and members of the bidding  teams  for  the  various
              equipment within the Strategic Defence Packages (SDP).


              The determination of responsibilities within  the  acquisition
              process needs to be rationalised and streamlined. It  came  to
              the attention of the parliamentary committees on defence  that
              senior DoD and Armscor officials frequently "wore a number  of
              hats", thereby limiting their ability to act  impartially  and
              to avoid a real or perceived  conflict  of  interest.  In  our
              opinion, this  impeded  good  governance.  This  is  not  only
              limited to the DoD and  Armscor,  but  includes  officials  of
              other state departments.


              An investigation needs to be conducted by the DoD and  Armscor
              of those individuals whose professional behaviour was  queried
              in the Report.


         K. Conclusion


              Implementation framework


              To ensure that the mentioned and  future  recommendations  are
              applied  in  a  consistent  and  rational  manner,  the  Joint
              Standing Committee on Defence will compile  an  implementation
              framework  that  will  specify,  amongst  other  things,   the
              following:


              1.  The co-ordinating responsibility for the implementation of
                  the diverse recommendations contained in this Report.


              2.   The  Executing  Authority/Authorities   responsible   for
                  implementing  those  recommendations,  which   have   been
                  assigned to them within the context of this Report.


              3.  The ongoing oversight/monitoring of these responsibilities
                  and their execution and the  authorities  responsible  for
                  this monitoring role.


     Report to be considered.
2.    Report of the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests on  the
     Joint Investigation  Report  into  the  Strategic  Defence  Procurement
     Packages, dated 6 December 2001:


         On 14 November 2001 the Speaker of the National  Assembly  referred
         the  Joint  Investigation  Report  into   the   Strategic   Defence
         Procurement Packages, in  so  far  as  it  relates  to  Members  of
         Parliament,  to  the  Joint  Committee  on  Ethics   and   Members'
         Interests for consideration.


         The Committee met on the 16  November  2001  and  agreed  that  the
         Report only makes two references to Members, namely:


         (1)     The allegation that Mr Mashimbye and Mr M Scott received  a
              motor vehicle from prime contractors/bidders was found  to  be
              without substance.


         (2)     Secondly, Chapter 1.3.1.2(4) in the  table  states  that  a
              criminal case is pending against  Mr  Yengeni.  The  Committee
              received opinion from the Chief Parliamentary Law Adviser that
              in terms of the sub judice rule it would be  prudent  for  the
              Committee to wait for the  conclusion  of  the  criminal  case
              before the Committee considers  the  allegation  of  the  non-
              disclosure of the benefit by Mr Yengeni.  The  Committee  will
              therefore pursue  the  matter  after  the  conclusion  of  the
              criminal case against Mr Yengeni.


         (3)     The Report makes reference to the lack  of  rules  to  deal
              with conflict of interests. In so far as Members of Parliament
              are concerned the Committee is considering a Code of  Conduct,
              of which the draft proposals specifically deal  with  conflict
              of interests and  post  tenure  employment  restrictions.  The
              Committee aims to complete the draft code in the first quarter
              of next year.
         (4)     The Committee had received a complaint against Mr Msomi  in
              respect of the alleged receipt of discounts on motor  vehicles
              from a bidder/contractor, the Investigating  Report  makes  no
              reference  to  the  allegations  against  Mr  Msomi,  and  the
              Committee  therefore  agreed  that  it   will   consider   the
              allegations against him through the normal procedures  of  the
              Committee.


         Report to be considered.

     Eastern Cape, dated 3 October 2001:


     The Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality  of  Life  and
     Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons visited the Eastern Cape
     from 2 to 4 May 2001 as guest  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Youth,
     Gender and Disabled of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature.


     The Committee reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         1. Background


              Pursuing its parliamentary oversight function,  in  accordance
              with Joint Rule 132D of the Joint  Rules  of  Parliament,  the
              Committee visited the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature (the
              Legislature).


              The Eastern Cape was identified as the first  province  to  be
              visited, based on the following motivation:
              (a) It is one of the provinces that has established a  similar
                  committee.


              (b)  It  is  also  one  of  the  rural  and   poverty-stricken
                  provinces.


         2. Objectives


              (a) To monitor the status  of  children,  youth  and  disabled
                  people in the province.


              (b) To establish a  working  relationship  with  the  Standing
                  Committee on Youth, Gender  and  Disabled  People  of  the
                  Legislature (the Standing Committee).


              (c) To meet with members  of  the  Office  on  the  Status  of
                  Disabled People (OSDP), the  Provincial  Youth  Commission
                  (PYC) and the  Provincial  Plan  of  Action  for  Children

              (e) To evaluate  provincial  progress  with  implementing  the
                  Convention on the Rights of  the  Child  (UNCRC)  and  the
                  establishment and location of the PPA.


              (f) To monitor the PYC's progress since inception.


              (g) To monitor  progress  of  the  Office  on  the  Status  of
                  Disabled People  with  implementation  of  the  Integrated
                  National Disability Strategy (INDS).


              (h) To look at the different responsibilites and co-ordination
                  of  work  between  the  Office  of  the  Premier  and  the
                  programmers based in that Office.

              Ms Bogopane, our  chairperson,  initiated  the  visit  to  the
              province on behalf of the Committee. The  Committee  therefore

     B.     Findings


         1. Welcoming by Standing Committee


              Mr Chris Motsilili, chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee,
              welcomed the Committee, expressed his sincere appreciation  to
              the Committee for electing to  visit  the  Eastern  Cape,  and
              expressed  the  hope  that  the  Committee  and  the  Standing
              Committee would learn from one another.


              He outlined the programme for the three days.


         2. Official opening by Deputy Speaker


              The Deputy Speaker of the Legislature welcomed  the  Committee
              on behalf of the Speaker, Mr M  Matomela.  She  gave  a  brief
              background on the establishment of the Standing Committee,  as
              well as its roles and functions.  She  wished  the  Committees
              success on their deliberations.


         3. Joint meeting


              The joint  meeting  was  co-chaired  by  Ms  Bogopane  and  Mr
              Motsilili.


              Ms Bogopane outlined the aims and objectives of the visit. She
              also outlined the rules establishing our  Committee,  and  its
              role, functions and powers in terms of  Joint  Rules  132A  to
              132D.


              Mr Motsilili took the Committee through the terms of reference
              of the Standing Committee (as stated by the  Deputy  Speaker),
              and said that the Standing Committee was established  in  July
              1999,  before  the  establishment  of  the  Joint   Monitoring
              Committee.


              The  following  differences  between   the   committees   were
              identified,  which  would  require  attention  in   order   to
              facilitate smooth working relations:

         4. Presentation by OSDP


              The OSDP was established on 1 April 1999, and up to  now  only
              one official has been employed.


              (a) Questions asked


                  *     How  does  the  OSDP  interact  with  the   Standing
                    Committee?


                  *     What  has  been  done  to  make   public   buildings
                    accessible to disabled people?


                  *    How many buildings are still inaccessible?


                  *    Which criteria were used  to  make  public  buildings
                    accessible, and how were they identified?


                  *    How many special schools are in the province?


                  *    What role has the OSDP played in  solving  disability
                    grant problems?


                  *    What kind of leadership  has  the  OSDP  provided  in
                    policy development for disabled people?


                  *    Has the OSDP benefitted  from  being  placed  in  the
                    Premier's Office?


                  *    Why has there been only one employee in the Office?


                  *    What are the barriers  that  make  it  difficult  for
                    that employee to play a co-ordinating role?


                  *    Has the Premier been informed about the lack  of  co-
                    operation from departments?


              (b) Problems identified (which hinders delivery)


                  *    A lack of capacity in the Office to  co-ordinate  and
                    monitor policies


                  *    A lack of provincial strategy to implement the INDS
                  *    Delays at the departments of education and of  health
                    to establish disability unit


                  *    Non-availability of sufficient funds.


              (c) Weaknesses identified


                  *    No effective interaction with the Premier


                  *    No co-ordination of rural development


                  *    No  disability  audits  have  been  conducted  within
                    government departments


                  *    Disability projects have not  been  monitored,  as  a
                    result of financial constraints


                  *    No clear  understanding  as  to  why  the  Office  is
                    situated in the Premier's Office.


         5. Presentation by PPA


              The delegation was briefed by Ms K Scott, co-ordinator of  the
              PPA, located in the provincial department of welfare.


              (a) Questions asked


                  *    How was the PPA established, who constitutes  it  and
                    when was it established?


                  *     What   programme   have   they   implemented   since
                    inception?


                  *    Where is the PPA located at present?


                  *    What  role  has  the  PPA  played  in  child  support
                    grants?


                  *    What has been the nature  of  the  division  of  work
                    between the PPA, the Office  of  the  Premier  and  the
                    Standing Committee?


                  *    Has the PPA audited legislation regarding children?


                  *    What are the frustrations of the PPA?


              (b) Problems identified (which hinders service delivery)


                  *     Non-attendance  of  senior  officials  in  workshops
                    organised by the PPA


                  *    A  lack  of  resources  to  co-ordinate  and  monitor
                    policy/programmes   relating   to   children   in   all
                    departments


                  *    Programmes and activities are not the  responsibility
                    of the PPA, but of the department of welfare


                  *    The location of the PPA in the department of  welfare
                    leads to a lack of budgeted funds and of recognition


                  *    The present  formation  of  the  PPA  excludes  civil
                    society


                  *    Due to the above, the  effectiveness  and  visibility
                    of the PPA has been non-existent - it has not been able
                    to respond to the needs of children in the province.


              (c) Weaknesses identified (which hinders service delivery)
                  *    No budget


                  *    No staff


                  *    No status


                  *    It is not located in a  position  that  empowers  the
                    programme to perform its functions


                  *     Mobilisation   and   co-ordination,   as   well   as
                    partnerships between the government and civil  society,
                    do not exist.


         6. Presentation by PYC


              The  delegation  was  briefed  by  Mr   Thembisile   Macelesi,
              chairperson of the PYC.


              (a) Questions asked


                  *    Does  the  PYC  have  statistics  on  youth  who  are
                    infected with HIV/AIDS?


                  *    What is the relationship  between  the  PYC  and  the
                    Standing Committee?


                  *    Why in the Provincial Youth  Commission  Act  is  the
                    PYC  proposing  the  appointment  of  three   full-time
                    provincial commissioners?


                  *    What are  the  PYC's  expectations  of  the  Standing
                    Committee?


                  *    Why does the PYC want to  implement  or  start  pilot
                    projects?


                  *    How is the  relationship  between  the  PYC  and  the
                    National Youth Commission?
                  *    Is the  Premier  aware  of  the  dissolution  of  the
                    Interdepartmental Youth Committee?


              (b) Problems identified (which hinders service delivery)


                  *    There is no provision for the creation of  Provincial
                    Youth Commissions in the National Youth Commission Act


                  *    The National  Youth  Commission  Act  also  does  not
                    outline the relationship between the NYC and PYC


                  *    The National Youth Commission  Act  fails  to  define
                    the role  of  provincial  governments  in  funding  the
                    operations and programmes of the PYC.


              (c) Weaknesses identified


                  *    Lack of clearly defined powers of the  NYC  over  the
                    PYC


                  *    Lack of monitoring of projects


                  *    Lack of database on status of youth in the province


                  *    Lack of co-ordination  of  youth  programmes  in  the
                    province


                  *    Shortcomings of the  NYC  are  allowed  to  influence
                    their work.


         7. Outreach visit


              The Committee was divided into  two  groups,  because  of  the
              vastness of the province, and to award members an  opportunity
              to see different things at the same time. The one group  would
              report to the other.
              Places to be visited


              (a) Multi-Purpose Youth Centre in Cradock


              (b) Makana  Primary  School,  Day-Care  Hospital  and  Welfare
                  Offices in Grahamstown


              (c) Special School for Mentally Disabled Children in Tsolo


              (d) Fabkomp factory in Sweetwater's


              Group 1


              This group went to Grahamstown and Cradock, and consisted of:


              *   Ms Bogopane, leader of the delegation


              *   Mr C Motsilili


              *   Mr T Macelesi
              *   Mr D P N Maloyi, Committee member


              *   Mr M I Moss, Committee member


              *   Mr N M Raju, Committee member


              *   Ms S Rajbally, Committee member.


              The aim was to evaluate the accessibility project, which is  a
              partnership between the PYC, the OSDP and  the  Department  of
              Public Works.


              (a) Accessibility project


                  The project has benefitted young people and  will  benefit
                  disabled people in the future.  The  following  weaknesses
                  were identified:


                  *    Before identifying and prioritising buildings,  there
                    was not proper consultation with and agreement  by  the
                    stakeholders, which, for example, led to buildings  not
                    in urgent need of renovations being renovated.


                    The deputy director of the OSDP herself  is  physically
                    disabled. She has been in an  inaccessible  office  for
                    the past two years - she could hardly identify her  own
                    office for renovation.  Also,  there  is  no  sign  for
                    parking for people with disability at the  legislature,
                    where she parks every day. Instead, a primary school in
                    a community in Grahamstown was renovated,  where  there
                    is no disabled child enrolled.


                  *    Lack  of  consultation  with  people  working  in  or
                    heading the different  institutions  identified  to  be
                    made accessible.


                    For example: The Grahamstown Day Hospital used  a  ramp
                    for stretchers when ambulances brought patients  there.
                    The ramp can now not be used for that purpose  anymore,
                    as walls have been built to make it  longer  so  as  to
                    enable a person in  a  wheelchair  to  use  it  without
                    assistance. So now the clinic is  inaccessible,  as  it
                    has no ramp for severely ill patients.


                    When we enquired how such a  mistake  can  happen,  the
                    sisters and doctors indicated that  they  were  neither
                    consulted nor informed of the renovations -  they  were
                    not even aware of what else would be happening  to  the
                    clinic. All they knew, was that people had come to take
                    measurements; they never saw the plans or charts.
                  *    The project is not supervised by  anybody  to  ensure
                    that it meets  the  required  accessibility  standards,
                    neither is anybody checking structure quality.


                    At the Department  of  Welfare,  a  toilet  had  to  be
                    renovated by fitting a  slightly  wider  sliding  door.
                    However, all that was done, was to change the  door  to
                    open from the outside instead of the inside, which made
                    it difficult for a person in a wheelchair to  open  it,
                    as it would open towards that person.


                    At Makana Primary School, ramps  were  built,  but  the
                    classroom was still inaccessible. A child would  go  up
                    the ramp, but would not be able to enter the classroom.


                  *    The project was not  planned;  the  stakeholders  did
                    not  agree  to  the  duration  of  the  contract   (the
                    commission indicated that the department had  said  the
                    money  was  finished,  but  the  contractors  did   not
                    complete the work).


                  *    The OSDP indicated  that  it  is  the  South  African
                    Federal Council on Disability (SAFCD) that had  handled
                    the project. They provided the list  of  buildings  and
                    accessibility guidelines, and  they  entered  into  the
                    partnership, not the OSDP.


                  *    The PYC indicated  that  they  were  responsible  for
                    identifying young people for training as  well  as  for
                    the institutions that trained young people.  They  were
                    further  responsible  for   facilitating   a   way   of
                    integrating these  young  people  at  the  end  of  the
                    project. The employers have taken  some  of  the  young
                    people permanently.


              (c) Visit to Mayor's office


                  We met the Mayor and his councillors, but we  were  unable
                  to hold a meaningful meeting - the lift was  not  working,
                  so we could not reach his office. We were introduced,  and
                  the purpose of the visit to Grahamstown was explained.


              (d) Visit to Youth Multi-Purpose Centre in Cradock


                  This Centre is one of those built by the PCY. The  manager
                  gave a brief background and took us on a tour  around  the
                  building. He indicated that he would no longer be able  to
                  manage  the  Centre,  as  he  was  going   back   to   the
                  Department.
                  The purpose of the Centre was for departments  to  use  it
                  for their youth programmes.  Unfortunately  that  has  not
                  happened yet, as it is  a  well-developed  structure,  but
                  under-utilised at present.


              Group 2


              This group went to  the  Tsolo  Special  School  for  Mentally
              Disabled Children, and consisted of:


              *   Mr B Willem, leader of the delegation


              *   Ms Hobongwana, Standing Committee member


              *   Ms M S Maine, Committee member


              *   Ms N Cindi, Committee member


              *   Mrs J Witbooi, Committee member
              *   Ms C Nkuna, Committee member.


              (a) The principal of the school welcomed the delegation:


                  *    In 1977, the School  started  catering  for  mentally
                    disabled children only. The vision of this School is to
                    develop and raise the level of self-esteem of  mentally
                    disabled  children  through  education,  training   and
                    practical skills. Through its  mission  statement,  the
                    School is committed to work  in  partnership  with  all
                    stakeholders, so as to ensure that each learner receive
                    the best education.


                  *    At present, the School has  an  enrolment  figure  of
                    70, and three teachers employed by the government, plus
                    two volunteers and nine non-teachers.
                  *    The government, grants and school fees  of  R100  per
                    learner per month fund the school.


                  *    The  school  governing  body  consists  of  a  social
                    worker,  a  psychiatric  nurse,   four   parents,   two
                    community members and the school principal.


              (b) Constraints


                  The principal mentioned the following  problems  hindering
                  the effectiveness of the school:


                  *    Lack of access to telephones


                  *    Lack of access to electricity


                  *    Lack of accommodation


                  *    Lack of beds and bedding.


              (c) Meeting with Premier


                  The Committee met with the Premier before  they  left  the
                  province  on  4  May.  Introductions  were  done  by  both
                  chairpersons.


                  The  background  to  the  visit  was  set   out   by   the
                  chairperson of the  Committee.  The  provincial  programme
                  was  outlined  by  the   chairperson   of   the   Standing
                  Committee.


                  The Premier welcomed the Committee to his Office  (not  to
                  the province, as that had already been done by the  deputy
                  speaker). He also thanked  us  for  visiting  the  Eastern
                  Cape.


                  Ms Bogopane highlighted our findings  and  recommendations
                  to  be  considered  by  the  province,  and  referred   to
                  presentations, questions asked and weaknesses  identified.
                  Findings  and  recommendations  in  this  Report  are  the
                  issues raised with the Premier,  recommendations  made  to
                  him and his response to questions.


     C.     Conclusion


         This visit was long overdue - the province required guidance  on  a
         number of areas, and we were in a  position  to  assist.  Committee
         members were exposed to the  challenges  faced  by  provinces,  the
         interpretation of some of the legislation passed  by  the  National
         Assembly and how this  impacts  on  the  lives  of  people  in  the
         province.


         Lack of exposure to a  number  of  activities,  and  to  documents,
         impedes smooth functioning and  interpretation  of  issues  by  the
         province. The impact of poverty  is  a  reality  in  the  province.
         There  is  a  high  level  of  illiteracy,  and  officials  in  the
         Premier's Office lack a  general  understanding  of  the  political
         clout  and  status  of  their  programme  in  relation   to   other
         departments.


         Due to the vast needs of the province,  institutions  such  as  the
         PYC, which is supposed  to  be  co-ordinating  programmes,  end  up
         implementing programmes in order to  try  and  meet  the  needs  of
         young people in the province. This  leads  to  misunderstanding  of
         the  role  of  these  programmes,  and  the  chances  of  it  being
         corrected, are very slim.


     D.     Recommendations


         The Committee recommends that:


              (a) the name and status of the Standing  Committee  on  Youth,
                  Gender and Disabled be changed


              (b) the Provincial Plan of Action for children be relocated to
                  the Premier's Office


              (c) budgets be allocated to programmes, so as to enable it  to
                  function properly


              (d) the OSDP be staffed immediately to ensure that it is well-
                  equipped to respond to the needs of disabled people


              (e)   the   Integrated   National   Disability   Strategy   be
                  provincialised  to  ensure  that  it   responds   to   the
                  immediate needs of disabled people


              (f)  an  awareness  campaign   on   inclusive   education   be
                  established, led by the Standing Committee


              (g) amendments to the promotion  of  youth  affairs  be  fast-
                  tracked
              (h) the amendments in  paragraph  (g)  above  also  include  a
                  reduction in the number  of  commissioners  and  in  their
                  terms of office


              (i) the restructuring of the Provincial  Youth  Commission  be
                  accelerated


              (j) the role of  the  Premier's  Office  be  re-emphasised  to
                  public servants serving  in  that  Office,  and  that  the
                  Standing Committee explain their political  responsibility
                  to them


              (k) the Standing Committee concentrate on  the  implementation
                  and  allocation  of  budgets  to  the  programmes  it   is
                  responsible for


              (l)  the  Standing  Committee  no  longer  deal  with   junior
                  officials but with heads of department


              (m) the Standing Committee monitor all departments,  not  only
                  ones closely linked to it.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:
1.    Report of the  Constitutional  Review  Committee,  dated  14  November
     2001:


     The Constitutional Review Committee reports as follows:


     1.     As a result of a very full parliamentary programme and  members'
         many other duties and commitments, the  Committee  met  only  three
         times. The subgroup, whose task it was to consider the  submissions
         received and to plan  the  Constitutional  Literacy  Campaign,  met
         twice only. The result was that the  Committee  did  not  have  the
         time to consider the submissions it had received, as it would  have
         liked to.


     2.     The Committee received 328 submissions. Because no due date  had
         been indicated in  the  advertisement,  submissions  were  received
         throughout the year.


     3.     Issues raised in the  submissions  included  the  following,  in
         order of numbers:
         (a)     Right to possess, bear and use firearms.


         (b)     Death penalty.


         (c)     Rule of Law and fitting punishment for criminals.


         (d)     Electoral system.


         (e)      Chapter  Nine  bodies  -  appointment  of  members,  size,
              performance and efficacy.


         (f)     Multilingualism.


         (g)     Rights and powers  of  local,  traditional  and  indigenous
              leaders.


         (h)     Bill of Rights.


         (i)     Accountability of public representatives.


         (j)     Separation of powers.


     4.     It was apparent from the submissions received that most  members
         of the public did not have a clear understanding of what should  be
         enshrined in the Constitution, and what should be provided  for  in
         legislation. The Committee was very aware of this fact, and  tasked
         its  subgroup  to  investigate  the  possibility  to   initiate   a
         Constitutional Literacy Campaign, to  be  run  countrywide,  before
         the next general election.


     5.     The Committee realised that, when formulating advertisements  in
         future, it would be wise to focus  on  certain  issues  each  year,
         without precluding submissions from the public on  general  issues.
         Political parties should submit representations  on  constitutional
         matters which they regard in need of attention.


     6.     The Committee is of the view that there is a need to clarify its
         role in relation to other parliamentary committees,  which  propose
         and effect amendments to the Constitution.  The  Committee  further
         deems  it  desirable  that  all   envisaged   amendments   to   the
         Constitution also be referred to it for input. The Committee  deems
         it important that there  should  be  a  clear  understanding  among
         parliamentary  committees  about  their  individual  functions  and
         powers. This matter needs to be pursued in 2002.

National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Chairperson:


     The President of the Republic submitted the following letter,  dated  4
     January 2002, to the Chairperson of the National Council  of  Provinces
     informing Parliament of the employment of the  South  African  National
     Defence Force:


         Dear Mrs Pandor,


         EMPLOYMENT  OF  THE  SOUTH  AFRICAN  NATIONAL  DEFENCE   FORCE   IN
         COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF  THE  REPUBLIC  OF
         SOUTH AFRICA TOWARDS THE ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN UNITY


         This serves to inform the National  Council  of  Provinces  that  I
         authorised the employment of South African National  Defence  Force
         (SANDF) personnel to fulfil the international  obligations  of  the
         Republic of South Africa towards the OAU  Mission  in  the  Federal
         Islamic Republic of Comoros (FIRC).


         This employment was authorised in accordance  with  the  provisions
         of Section 82(4)(b)(ii) read with Section 227(1)(b) and (c) of  the
         Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 (Act No. 200  of
         1993), [which Sections continue to be in force  in  terms  of  item
         24(1) of Schedule 6 to the Constitution of the  Republic  of  South
         Africa, 1996 (Act No. 108 of  1996)],  read  further  with  Section
         3(2)(a)(v) of the Defence Act, 1957 (Act No. 44 of 1957).


         A total of 4 personnel has been deployed  to  the  Federal  Islamic
         Republic of the Comoros (FIRC) to  act  as  military  observers  as
         part of the  OAU  Military  Observer  Mission  to  the  Comoros  to
         oversee the operation of arms collection on the island of Anjouan.


         The deployment is made up of:


              (a) 1X Colonel - Small arms expert to lead the mission
              (b) 1X Major - Small arms expert
              (c) 1X Warrant Officer - Secretary
              (d) 1X Warrant Officer - Small arms expert


         The SANDF members have been deployed for a total of  21  days  with
         the possibility that members  may  be  required  to  deploy  for  a
         maximum period of up to six months to cover possible  extension  of
         the mission.


         The expected costs for the deployment of personnel for 21  days  up
         to a maximum of 180 days (6 months) to  the  mission  area  are  as
         follows:


              (a) Deployment of 4 personnel for 21  days  (accommodation  in
                  tents)R34 740,30
              (b) Deployment of 4 personnel for 21  days  (accommodation  in
                  hotelR30 064,86
              (c) Deployment of 4 personnel for 180 days  (accommodation  in
                  tents)R222 059,69
              (d) Deployment of 4 personnel for 21  days  (accommodation  in
                  tents)R181 984,49
              (e) Transport and accommodation for mobilisation (two  members
                  to mobilise from Cape Town -  costs  already  included  in
                  the above totals)R10 000,00


         The total cost may thus amount to a total  of  between  R30  064,86
         and R222 059,69.


         The Department of Defence is responsible  for  the  costs  of  this
         deployment.


         I will also communicate this report to the Members of the  National
         Assembly, and wish to request that you bring the contents  of  this
         report to the notice of the National Council of Provinces.

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Education and Recreation  on  Public
     Hearings held by Provincial Legislatures on Sexual Violence in Schools,
     dated 12 February 2002:


     The Select Committee on Education and Recreation reports as follows:


     INTRODUCTION


     The Select Committee on Education  and  Recreation  requested  Standing
     Committees in all  legislatures  to  hold  public  hearings  on  sexual
     violence in schools. This took place after the Human Rights Watch  sent
     a report to the Select Committee  entitled  "Scared  at  Schools".  The
     report indicated that sexual abuse and harassment of girls by educators
     and fellow learners are widespread in South African schools.
     The following legislatures held public hearings:


     * North West.
     * Northern Cape.
     * Eastern Cape.
     * Free State.
     * Mpumalanga.


     The Western Cape did not have public hearings, but had a debate in  the
     Legislature. They also have guidelines  on  how  to  deal  with  sexual
     violence in schools.


     Due to time constraints, the Gauteng Legislature  was  unable  to  have
     their public hearings in 2001. The Legislature, has  however  scheduled
     to have the public hearings on 14 and 15 March 2002. There  will  be  8
     regional workshops across the Province. Principals and Chairpersons  of
     School Governing Bodies from all schools in the province, together with
     learners, will attend these workshops, which will focus on solutions to
     the issue of sexual violence in  schools.  The  Legislature  will  also
     invite experts on gender violence to facilitate the workshops.


     This Report focuses on the submissions made in the provinces,  and  the
     recommendations from stakeholders. Furthermore, the report  deals  with
     the findings and recommendations of the Select Committee.


     SUBMISSIONS


     THE NORTH WEST EDUCATION STANDING COMMITTEE


     The Education Standing Committee of the North West Legislature  visited
     schools in  the  Temba  District,  Rustenburg,  Klerksdorp,  Taung  and
     Mmabatho. The Committee heard input from educators, educators'  unions,
     social workers, and the police. This  section  focuses  on  the  sexual
     abuse of learners generally, including abuse that  took  place  outside
     school premises.


     The table below shows cases that have been reported to  the  police  in
     different regions of the North West  province.  However,  most  of  the
     sexual abuse cases go unreported. The cases noted below  include  rape,
     abduction and indecent assault.

     * Temba District
     The hearings for the Temba District revealed that girls from the age of
     15 years and below have  fallen  survivor  to  sexual  violence.  These
     incidents happen at home, on the way to school and even at school.  The
     survivors know most of the perpetrators  either  as  neighbours  or  as
     relatives. Some of the cases  are  never  reported,  while  others  are
     withdrawn or dropped.


     Educators report most of these cases to the police after being told  by
     the learners themselves. In some cases, when the  educator  reports  an
     alleged incident to the parents, the family chooses to  deal  with  the
     matter privately.

     * Submission by the South African Police Services (SAPS)


     The SAPS in the area work with the  Child  Protection  Unit  (CPU)  and
     social workers  when  dealing  with  sexual  violence  cases  involving
     children. The CPU informed the public that:


     o They have the right to report cases without giving their names.
     o Educators have the right to reopen cases that have been withdrawn  by
        parents.


     The CPU voiced their concern that parents do not advise and guide their
     children. They appealed to parents to talk to their children.
     * Rustenburg


     As is the case in the  Temba  District,  the  table  below  shows  that
     children in the Rustenburg area are raped by people who  are  known  to
     them. Cases that were reported, mostly involved girls between the  ages
     of 8 and 17 years. These incidents  also  happen  either  at  home,  at
     school or on the way to school.

     * CPU


     The CPU in Rustenburg informed the Committee that they:


     * Needed full co-operation of parents and educators  and,  appealed  to
        them that they have to support the children.
     * Visit schools to give lessons about sexual abuse.
     * Have also started the "Adopt a Cop" programme,  where  cops  will  be
        "adopted" in schools. Children would  go  to  a  particular  police
        officer when they have problems.


     * Klerksdorp


     The police in Klerksdorp reported that the  most  dominating  crime  in
     schools is assault in  classrooms  and  toilets.  They  suggested  that
     educators should teach children how  to  report  these  incidents.  The
     Child Protection Unit in the  area  visits  schools  to  give  learners
     lessons on sexual abuse, drug  and  alcohol  abuse  as  well  as  crime
     prevention.


     Some of the evidence heard by the Committee includes:


     * A case of a 15-year old girl who was raped on her way to school.  She
        reported the matter after 3 days, and the court  ruled  that  there
        was no sufficient evidence, although the doctor confirmed that  the
        girl was raped.


     * A 16-year old girl who was killed and cut into pieces. The  community
        knows the perpetrators but no one is prepared to come forward.
     * A learner who reported being abused by  her  educator  to  her  class
        teacher but was threatened and told to change the  details  of  the
        case.


     The learners appealed to the public to protect and support them because
     they are  survivorised  by  educators  at  school.  They  informed  the
     Committee that they are usually failed if  they  refuse  advances  from
     educators.


     * Taung


     The table below indicates that reported cases of sexual violence in the
     area mainly involve girls between the ages of 15 and 17  years.  It  is
     also evident from the table that in most cases, the survivors know  the
     perpetrators.

     Evidence heard by the Committee included:


     * The case of an 11-year-old girl who  was  raped  by  her  35-year-old
       uncle. The girl was given orders to change  her  statement  and  the
       case was withdrawn after family members had met and decided that  it
       was a family matter.
     * The case of a man who transported primary school learners.  He  raped
       two girls aged 7 and 8 years. This incident was reported and the man
       was arrested, charged and sentenced to 7 years in prison.


     Recommendations by the North West


     * SAPS/ Child Protection Unit


     The  South  African  Police  Service  and  the  Child  Protection  Unit
     recommended that:


     * There be close co-operation between the Departments of Education,  of
       Justice, of Social Development  and  the  SAPS.  Furthermore,  there
       should  be  programmes  to  educate  children  on  how  to   protect
       themselves from sexual violence.


     * Schools should stop sending children out with donation lists, as some
       people take advantage of the children and abuse them.


     * Investigating officers be trained for the  job.  In  addition,  steps
       should  be  taken  against  investigators  who  accept  bribes  from
       perpetrators.


     * The community be taught to support rape survivors and not  stigmatise
       them.


     * The Departments of  Education,  of  Health,  of  Justice,  of  Social
       Development, the SAPS and the community come up with a safety policy
       for schools.


     * Educators and Unions


     The educators and the unions recommended that:


     *  Educators  should  not  be  sexually  involved  with  any   learner,
       irrespective of whether the learner is in that school or not.
     * The  public  should  be  educated  on  the  Constitution,  especially
       sections pertaining to the Bill of Rights.
     *  The  SAPS  should  protect  informers  to   avoid   harassment   and
       survivorisation by perpetrators or the community.
     * The Department of Education must draft policies that will protect the
       educator who reports the case to the police.
     * There should be a policy  on  sexual  abuse  in  schools  to  control
       harassment.
     * Social workers should  be  adopted  in  schools  to  assist  guidance
       teachers.
     * The Child Protection Unit should be visible in schools and meet  with
       educators regularly.
     * Parents should take the trouble to report their children's  cases  to
       the police.


     * Social workers


     Some of the recommendations made by the social workers were that:


     * Crisis centres were needed in police stations.
     * There should be awareness campaigns in  schools  and  pre-schools  on
       sexual violence.
     * Parents should be made to understand the  impact  of  rape  on  their
       children if the perpetrators are not arrested. They  should  support
       their children during court cases  and  should  not  force  them  to
       withdraw cases.
     * District surgeons should be reinstated and work effectively with  the
       courts.
     * Mobile police stations should be established in rural and farm areas.
     * The  media  should  be  used  to  educate  communities  about  sexual
       violence.


     THE NORTHERN CAPE LEGISLATURE


     * Kimberley


     No public input was received from schools in Kimberely,  as  they  were
     preparing for examinations.


     * Upington


     Parents informed the Committee that:


     * Educators also need to be protected from sexual violence  in  school.
       Legislation is needed to protect them.
     * Cases of sexual violence take long to be resolved. One case had  been
       going on for three  years,  and  the  perpetrators  were  not  found
       guilty.
     * Two girls aged 9 and  10  were  raped  throughout  the  night.  Their
       grandmother said that more should be done to help the children  deal
       with the problem and there should be social  workers  in  school  to
       deal with these problems immediately.


     The educators told the Committee that:


     * They felt  that  they  do  not  have  adequate  training  to  counsel
       learners.
     * A social worker is needed  in  school  in  order  to  deal  with  the
       problems.
     *  Sexual  violence  leads  to   drug   abuse,   violence   and   other
       misdemeanours. Therefore, parents and educators should be trained in
       order to help with these problems.
     * Calvinia


     Learners informed the Committee that:


     * Provision should be made for social workers to be at schools  because
       it is easier to talk to them.
     * Educators should be trained to provide immediate  trauma  relief  for
       learners.


     * De Aar


     The Committee was informed that cases took too long to be resolved  and
     learners felt that they could not trust the  police.  Some  cases  were
     never followed up and the processes took long.


     The police and social services were urged  to  share  information  with
     learners in order to raise awareness.


     Recommendations by the Northern Cape Legislature


     * Legislation should be drafted so that the processes of  dealing  with
       these cases could be expedited.
     * A well co-ordinated procedure involving the SAPS, and the Departments
       of Education,  of  Social  Development  and  of  Justice  should  be
       developed.
     * Police visibility is required before and after  school  in  order  to
       protect learners from harassment by others.
     * A social worker is needed on duty to respond to problems immediately.
     * Educators and parents should be trained  to  give  counselling  where
       needed.
     * Educators need protection as they are sometimes also targeted.
     * The community and the school governing body should  play  a  role  as
       this problem originates in the community.  Community  forums  should
       participate in combating the problem.


     THE WESTERN CAPE LEGISLATURE


     The Standing Committee on Education, Environmental and Cultural Affairs
     in  the  Western  Cape  reported  that  the  provincial  Department  of
     Education briefed them on child abuse in schools and  findings  of  the
     Human Rights Watch. The legislature also held a debate on 30 May 2001.


     The provincial Department of Education  has  also  produced  a  booklet
     called "Abuse No More", which is the result of two years of work by the
     department  and  officials,  in  consultation  with  NGOs   and   other
     specialists. According to the then MEC for  Education  in  the  Western
     Cape, Ms H Zille, this document:


     * Is a guideline for action.
     * Gives all the symptoms that a child displays when he or  she  may  be
       abused.
     * Gives all the steps that an educator is required to take to deal with
       sexual violence.
     * Provides all the guidelines  for  protecting  the  child,  especially
       confidentiality, and ensures that he or she never has to explain the
       incident more than once.
     * Have all the support  mechanisms  in  place,  from  psychological  to
       medical, to ensure that the problem can be dealt with.


     The department has also produced a  training  video  and  has  training
     teams to ensure that educators in all schools are trained  to  actively
     implement these protocols. This project is going  to  be  conducted  in
     conjunction with the provincial Departments of Welfare and of Health.


     THE EASTERN CAPE LEGISLATURE


     The Standing Committee visited the following 34 schools in the  Eastern
     Cape:


     * Mdeni School.
     * Ntabeni Secondary School.
     * Reuben Ntuli Junior Secondary School.
     * Upper Corona Senior Secondary School.
     * Mthweni Senior Secondary School.
     * Zanokanyo Senior Secondary School
     * Newell High School.
     * Lungiso High School.
     * Gamble High School.
     * Bethelsdorp High School.
     * Hillside High School.
     * Paterson Senior Secondary School.
     * Bongweni Primary School.
     * Alexandria High School.
     * Zuney Intermediate School.
     * Klipfontein High
     * Ukhayo High School.
     * Zolani Junior Secondary School.
     * Herschel Junior Secondary School
     * Lukanji Senior Primary School.
     * Bomeni Secondary School.
     * Vaalbank Junior Secondary School.
     * Sam Xali Higher Primary School.
     * Matthew Goniwe Senior Secondary School.
     * Dangwana Senior Secondary School.
     * Ndawana Junior Secondary School.
     * Jojo Senior Secondary School.
     * Mvenyane Senior Secondary School.
     * Sukude High School.
     * Tyali Secondary School.
     * Hector Peterson School.
     * Inkwenkwezi High School.
     * Nkangeleko High School.
     * Mababoti High School.
     * Vuli Valley High School.
     * Mbulelo Combined School.


     The Committee met with the school management, learners,  educators  and
     school governing bodies (SGBs) to hear evidence on  sexual  harassment,
     abuse and violence in schools. The Committee  also  identified  factors
     that contribute towards sexual violence in schools.


     Factors that contribute towards sexual violence in schools


     * Drug Abuse: The laxity of schools in allowing the use of drugs  is  a
       fundamental problem.


     * Poverty: In some families learners are encouraged to be involved with
       educators to get special treatment or  money.  Educators  also  take
       advantage of learners who come from poor families.


     * Drunkenness: The use of liquor by students in schools contributes  to
       sexual violence, which leads to girls being sexually abused.


     * Abusing Authority: Educators initiate sexual relations with  learners
       in exchange for favours like good grades or money.  This  encourages
       prostitution by female learners.


     * Stereotypes: Many women believe that men are dominant.


     During the public hearings, the Committee discovered  that  there  were
     schools where serious cases of sexual violence happen. These were:


     * Ntabeni Secondary School in Engobo,  where  an  educator  impregnated
       about 20 learners.


     * Bongweni Primary School, where an educator verbally  abuses  learners
       and forces them  to  urinate  or  undress  in  front  of  the  other
       learners.


     * Herschel Junior Secondary School,  where  two  educators  were  first
       reported of having sexual relations with learners in  1991.  An  SGB
       member died of a heart attack as a result of an argument with one of
       the educators.


     * Vaalbank Junior  Secondary  School,  where  a  deputy  principal  was
       involved in a relationship with a learner under the age of consent.


     * Matthew Goniwe Senior Secondary School, where  an  educator  raped  a
       learner twice and infected the learner with HIV. It is also  alleged
       that the same educator infected two other learners, but nothing  has
       been done about the case.


     General Findings of the Committee
     The Committee, having considered evidence heard during  visits  to  the
     schools, made the following findings:


     * There is no gender-based policy that is  actively  enforced  to  deal
       with sexual harassment of learners at school.
     * Education and  training  of  educators,  learners,  school  governing
       councils and school governing bodies are non-existent in schools.
     *  Counselling  services  for  survivors  and  perpetrators  of  sexual
       violence are non-existent in schools.
     * It has been alleged that some  public  representatives,  high-ranking
       officials and  community  leaders  are  involved  in  this  kind  of
       misconduct.
     * Co-ordination between the Department of Welfare, Health,  Safety  and
       Security and Criminal  Justice  on  investigating  cases  of  sexual
       violence to ensure punishment of perpetrators is often  ineffective,
       ill - conceived or non-existent.
     Recommendations by the Eastern Cape Legislature


     The Committee recommends that:


     1.     Educators who are involved  in  sexual  violence  and  abuse  of
          learners  in  schools  not  be  transferred  to   other   schools.
          Furthermore, they should be suspended and disciplinary  action  be
          taken against them.  Further  criminal  charges  should  be  taken
          against them when necessary.


     2.     The department develops  policies  with  punitive  measures  and
          standard procedure for intervention against the abuse of  children
          and sexual violence at schools.


     3.     There be a link between the Departments of  Education,  Welfare,
          Safety and Security, Health and Justice to deal with such cases.


     4.     A telephone be provided, especially  in  rural  areas,  for  the
          survivors of abuse in order to enable them  to  report  the  cases
          without delay.
     5.     Survivors of sexual  violence,  especially  young  children,  be
          provided with legal assistance when  faced  with  lawyers  of  the
          perpetrators during court proceedings.


     6.     Sports events and school activities be closely monitored.


     7.     The  department  provide  a  counselling  service  to  both  the
          survivors and the perpetrators of violence.

     Legislature and some members of the Select Committee  conducted  public
     hearings in schools in Bloemfontein, Kroonstad and Qwa-Qwa.


     The schools visited, were:


     * Dr Block, Heidedal School.
     * Sehunelo High School.
     * Bainsvlei Combined School.
     * Moemedi High School.
     * Bloemfontein - Oos Primary School.
     * Vulamasango High School.
     * Dr Cingo High School.
     * Phepetso High School
     * Thakameso Secondary School
     * Bodibeng Secondary School.
     * Kgola Thuto Secondary School.
     * Bonamelo College.
     * Sekhutlong Secondary School.
     * Selelekela Secondary School.
     * Riverside Secondary School.


     The Committee noted that sexual violence was a very sensitive topic and
     that not everyone could boldly express himself or herself. A provincial
     report looks at causes of sexual harassment and barriers  to  reporting
     abuse.  The  Committee  also  made  some   general   observations   and
     recommendations.


     * Factors that cause sexual harassment


     Factors identified by the Committee as causing sexual harassment:


     * The failure of school authorities to respond decisively to  cases  of
       sexual abuse, which  discourages  learners  from  reporting  similar
       cases.
     * Learners' uncertainty of the outcome of reporting such cases  results
       in serious fear.
     * Unethical behaviour of educators.
     * Free access to alcohol  from  taverns  that  are  situated  in  close
       proximity to the school premises.
     * Learners thinking that it is acceptable to have sexual  relationships
       with educators.
     * Use of abusive language by  learners  and  educators.  Educators  use
       derogatory names to refer to learners and some learners  propose  to
       young educators.


     Barriers to reporting sexual abuse


     * The failure of school authorities  to  respond  to  cases  of  sexual
       abuse, which discourages learners from reporting similar cases.
     * Learners' uncertainty with respect to the outcomes of the cases.


     * General Observations


     The Committee noted that:


     * Sexual harassment is prevalent in schools. It mainly  occurs  between
       learners and educators.
     * A lack of sex education also exacerbates the situation.


     * Findings


     The Committee noted during the hearings that sexual  violence  is  rife
     and prevalent in Free State  schools.  They  noted  that  this  problem
     impacts on the schools and results in:


     * Continued deterioration of discipline within the school premises.
     * Learners mistrusting educators.
     * Aggressiveness.
     *  Sexually  harassed  learners  dropping  out  of  school   to   avoid
       embarrassment.


     * Recommendations by the Free State Legislature1


     The Committee, having listened to the evidence, recommended that:


     *  The  Department  of  Education,  in  close  co-operation  with   the
       Department of Social Development and the  SAPS,  conduct  a  further
       inquiry into this matter.
     * Every school's code of conduct prohibit sexual harassment and  sexual
       relations between a learner and an educator, as well  as  between  a
       learner  and  a  headmaster  or  deputy  headmaster  of  the  school
       concerned.
     * Sex education be introduced or encouraged to  furnish  learners  with
       more information regarding sexual harassment.
     * Future public hearings be held in camera because of  the  sensitivity
       of the topic.
     * It is necessary that social workers are appointed or visit schools to
       detect tendencies of sexual violence.


     MPUMALANGA LEGISLATURE


     The Portfolio Committee on  Education,  Sports,  Recreation,  Arts  and
     Culture in  Mpumalanga  visited  the  Highveld,  Eastvaal  and  Lowveld
     regions to conduct  public  hearings.  The  Committee  discovered  that
     children were being abused at home, on their way to school and also  at
     school. They noted the ways in which abuse  occurred  and  why  it  was
     happening, and made recommendations to help solve this problem.


     * Ways in which abuse occurs


     * Forced child prostitution:


     o Girls sometimes do not come to school because they are being kept  as
       sex slaves by elderly people for very little or no payment.
     o Because of poverty, some children prostitute themselves to get paid.
     o Where there are factories close to schools, factory workers abuse the
       children and pay them very little.
     o  Some  children  prostitute  themselves  to  get  food  to  fend  for
       themselves.


     * Migrant workers and starvation of kids in rural areas:


     o Because parents work far from home, some children stay alone and  end
       up being abused by community members.
     o Some children look after themselves, and this leads  to  prostitution
       in order to get food.


     * Educator to learner abuse:


     o Some educators abuse learners and are not  dismissed.  Instead,  they
       get transferred to other schools.
     o Educators buy liquor and other intoxicating drugs for learners before
       abusing them.
     o Educators abuse learners verbally.
     o Abuse at primary and secondary schools are disguised as "affairs".
     o Children between 6 and 7 years in lower grades are also abused.
     o Educators demand sexual favours from  learners  in  return  for  good
       grades.
     o This problem is prevalent among male educators.
     o Some educators are not disciplined and are made to  provide  for  the
       families with financial and other means.


     * Learner to learner abuse:


     o Male learners rape female learners at  bashes  (parties)  and  during
       school trips.
     o Lack of privacy at home leads to children doing  things  observed  at
       home to other children.
     o Perpetrators are male and survivors are female.


     * Family members to learner abuse:


     o Usually stepfathers, uncles, those who are breadwinners or biological
       fathers are perpetrators of abuse at home.
     o Mothers deny the truth about rapists or other culprits.
     o Sodomy is also discovered in  families  where  grandfathers  sodomise
       their grandchildren.


     * Cultural practices:


     o Traditional  courts  prosecute  rape  and  abuse  cases  without  the
       relevant authority.
     o The payment of damages (inhlawulo) leads to cases not being  reported
       to courts.
     o Families accepting lobola  for  newly  born  babies.  This  leads  to
       children being abused by the "in-laws" at an early age.


     * Community members to learner:


     o Families make  matters  worse  by  demanding  compensation  from  the
       abusers.
     o Traditional and family courts prosecute rape and abuse cases.
     o Some pastors and priests also subject kids to abuse by marrying  them
       at an early age.


     * Reasons why abuse occurs


     Factors that were cited during the hearings as  reasons  why  abuse  is
     taking place :


     * Lack of awareness campaigns on child abuse, leading  to  perpetrators
       being able to escape.
     *  Poverty,  which  leads  to   children   subjecting   themselves   to
       prostitution.
     * Lack of integration of government departments on poverty  alleviation
       programmes.
     * Power relations and negative aspects of our cultures.
     * Lack of sex education and discussions between parents and children as
       well as between educators and learners.
     * The notion that girls are sex objects.
     * Lack of school transport.
     * Lack of recreational facilities.
     * Shortage of specialised children's courts.
     * They believe that sleeping with an under-aged child will cure one  of
       HIV/Aids.
     * Failure of some parents to co-operate with educators.
     * Failure of the Department of Education to dismiss educators  who  are
       abusers.


     * Recommendations by Mpumalanga Legislature


     The Committee recommends that:


     * Sexual violence be declared a priority crime.
     * The media be used to build awareness of sexual abuse.
     * A National and Provincial Men's Indaba be held by the President.
     * The Department of Education immediately  dismiss  all  those  engaged
       sexually with school children.
     * Sex education be taught in schools and homes in languages  understood
       by those receiving the lessons.
     * The Departments of Education, of Social Services, of Health, the SAPS
       and the medical personnel establish survivor empowerment centres  or
       trauma centres to deal with cases of sexual abuse.
     * The Department of Social Services establish a social  security  grant
       for those living in poverty so that children must not be abused as a
       result thereof.
     * Children's courts that will be children - friendly be established  to
       ensure that perpetrators are punished for their actions.
     * Training of the police to handle cases of child abuse.
     *  The  Government  make  available  school  transport   for   learners
       travelling long distances.


     SELECT COMMITTEE'S FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


     It is evident that sexual violence is endemic in schools. As  a  result
     of the Human Rights Watch  report  entitled  "Scared  at  School",  the
     Select Committee embarked on a  provincial  fact-finding  mission.  The
     Select Committee was not able to visit all Provinces. However, this  is
     an ongoing process and some of  the  Provinces  that  did  not  conduct
     hearings due to various constraints, will still be visited. The purpose
     of the hearings was to assess the extent to which this scourge  affects
     schools, with a view to eradicating it.


     * Findings


     As a result of the above hearings, the  Committee  made  the  following
     findings:


     * The Department of Education has  no  policy  on  sexual  violence  in
       schools.
     * The South African Police Service is showing a distinct lack of effort
       in the investigation of cases. This  is  compounded  by  a  lack  of
       sufficient resources.
     * In the provinces where the hearings were held, it is clear  that  the
       problem of sexual harassment and violence against girl  children  is
       wide - spread and cuts across all race and class lines.
     * In the majority of the incidents, perpetrators were adult males known
       to the survivors. Survivors are primarily female between the ages of
       12 and 18 years, although incidents of survivors as young as 7  were
       reported.
     * Sexual violence and harassment, including rape, assault and  teasing,
       also took place between learners. In the majority of incidents,  the
       perpetrators were older boys and survivors younger girls.
     * There has been inadequate action to deal with the perpetrators or  to
       assist survivors in the  majority  of  the  cases  reported  to  the
       Committee.
     * A number of perpetrators  have  not  been  charged  by  the  criminal
       justice  system,  nor  have  they  faced  disciplinary  action  from
       education authorities. Many perpetrators continue to  teach  in  the
       same school where their survivors are learners. This  was  found  in
       the majority of the cases reported to the Committee.
     * Survivors of sexual violence are generally not treated appropriately.
       There are very  few  instances  where  children  are  supported  and
       believed when they make statements and give evidence. There is  also
       very  few  instances  where  appropriate  counselling  and  survivor
       support services are available.
     * It is evident that most of the perpetrators are invariably educators,
       as the report of the Human Rights Watch indicated.
     * Most of these cases of sexual violence against girls go unreported.
     * It is apparent that principals, school governing bodies  and  parents
       are turning a blind eye to sexual violence.
     * Certain  communities  are  also  demonstrating  a  complete  lack  of
       responsiveness.
     * There is a general lack of  awareness  about  sexual  violence  among
       learners, resulting in reluctance to report cases  to  the  relevant
       authorities.
     * Due to a  case  overload  in  courts,  sexual  abuse  cases  are  not
       adequately and speedily dealt with. This gives rise  to  a  lack  of
       confidence in the justice system.
     * Traditional beliefs and practices may contribute to  the  culture  of
       silence around sexual violence.
     * The educator's code of conduct is silent on how to deal  with  sexual
       violence.


     Conclusion


     Having considered the reports of the various  provincial  legislatures,
     the Committee concludes that:
     * It is apparent that sexual violence in schools is a serious problem.
     * The consequences of these acts leave deep social,  psychological  and
       physical scars on survivors.
     * It is a commonly held view that human dignity, values and respect for
       children be restored in our schools.
     * It has therefore become  imperative  for  all  stakeholders  to  work
       together in order to deal with this scourge  in  and  effective  and
       efficient manner.


     * Recommendations


     Emanating from the findings  of  the  Committee,  urgent  consideration
     needs to be given to implementing the following measures:


     * The Department of Education should  expedite  the  implementation  of
       policy on sexual violence within an agreed upon time - frame.
     * Learners need to be conscientised about reporting mechanisms.
     * Principals and SGBs need to be  held  accountable  if  they  fail  to
       address or report cases of sexual violence.
     *  There  should  be  greater  cohesion  between  the  Departments   of
       Education, of Justice and of Social Development in order to expedite
       the cases in court.
     * Stronger parental involvement in (their) children's sexual  education
       is encouraged.
     * South Africa needs a register of sex offenders, as is the practise in
       other countries.
     * Interaction between the Department of Education and Educators' Unions
       is encouraged to strengthen the fight  against  sexual  violence  in
       schools.
     * Section 17 (1) (g) of the Employment of Educators Act, Act No. 76  of
       1998, makes sexual violence in schools an automatically  dismissible
       offence, and the Committee would like to see  the  Department  apply
       this section of the Act rigidly.
