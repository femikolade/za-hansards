             FRAUD IN WESTERN CAPE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad-


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  'n ondersoek deur die Wes-Kaapse  Departement  van  Maatskaplike
           Dienste aan die lig gebring het dat daar grootskaalse bedrog  in
           die betrokke departement plaasvind;


       (b)  die bedrog wat gepleeg  word,  onder  andere  selfverryking  van
           amptenare  deur  die  vervalsing  van  mediese  verslae,   valse
           verklarings  oor  inkomste  en  sameswering   tussen   amptenare
           insluit, en dat sindikate  waarskynlik  ook  by  die  bedrogspul
           betrokke is;


       (c)  die Nuwe NP hierdie veragtelike dade  teen  pensioentrekkers  en
           weerlose kinders ten sterkste afkeur; en


  (2) die premier van die Wes-Kaap en sy Minister van Maatskaplike  Dienste
       en Armoedeverligting gelukwens met hul vinnige en effektiewe  optrede
       teen hierdie korrupsie en bedrog en hulle versoek om geen genade  aan
       die skuldiges te betoon nie.

[Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  an investigation  by  the  Western  Cape  Department  of  Social
           Services has revealed that large-scale fraud is taking place  in
           the department concerned;


       (b)  the fraud being committed includes, inter alia,  self-enrichment
           of  officials  by  falsification  of  medical   reports,   false
           statements on income and conspiracy among  officials,  and  that
           syndicates may probably also be involved in this fraud;


       (c)  the New NP strongly condemns these  despicable  deeds  committed
           against pensioners and vulnerable children; and


  (2) congratulates the Premier of the Western Cape  and  his  Minister  of
       Social Services and Poverty Alleviation on their speedy and effective
       action against corruption and fraud and requests  them  to  show  the
       guilty parties no mercy.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  STORM IN LOWER ORANGE AREA, NORTHERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr J HORNE: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad-


  (1) sy besorgdheid uitspreek oor die natuurramp wat die landbougemeenskap
       in die Benede Oranje-gebied in die Noord-Kaap getref het toe miljoene
       rande se skade veroorsaak is deur 'n reën- en haelstorm; en


  (2) die hele landbougemeenskap sterkte toewens en vra  dat  die  betrokke
       nasionale departement saam  met  die  Noord-Kaapse  departemente  sal
       besin om die landbougemeenskap te ondersteun, waar nodig.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its concern about the natural  disaster  which  struck  the
       agricultural community in the Lower Orange area in the Northern  Cape
       when damage amounting to millions of rands was caused by a  rain  and
       hail storm; and
  (2) wishes the entire agricultural community everything of the  best  and
       asks  that  the  relevant  national  department,  together  with  the
       Northern Cape departments, will consider supporting the  agricultural
       community, where necessary.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   AFRIKAANS LANGUAGE IN HIGHER EDUCATION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad-


  (1) met waardering kennis neem  dat  die  taalbeleid  vir  hoër  onderwys
       steeds aan Afrikaans ruimte bied om as akademiese en onderrigtaal  te
       bly funksioneer terwyl ander inheemse tale ook ontwikkel gaan word as
       akademiese tale;
  (2) egter van mening is dat, soos  voorgestel  deur  die  Gerwel-komitee,
       minstens die Wes-Kaap geregtig  is  op  een  Afrikaanse  universiteit
       omdat Afrikaans hier die dominante taal is;


  (3) van mening is dat sodanige universiteite nie in botsing sal wees  met
       die transformasieproses nie  aangesien  die  nasionale  Minister  van
       Onderwys self 'n universiteit of technikon met 'n Afrikataal as basis
       in die vooruitsig gestel het;


  (4) 'n beroep doen op die histories Afrikaanse universiteite om binne die
       raamwerk  van  die  neergelegde  beleid  Afrikaans  se   posisie   as
       onderrigtaal te verseker sonder  om  nie-Afrikaanssprekende  studente
       uit te sluit; en


  (5) voorts 'n beroep  doen  op  inrigtings  vir  hoër  onderwys  om  alle
       inheemse tale met betrekking tot hoër onderwys te ontwikkel.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with appreciation that the language policy for higher education
       still offers Afrikaans room to  remain  functioning  as  an  academic
       language  and  a  language  of  instruction  while  other  indigenous
       languages are also going to be developed as academic languages;


  (2) is of the opinion, however, that,  as  was  proposed  by  the  Gerwel
       Committee, the Western Cape at least is  entitled  to  one  Afrikaans
       university because Afrikaans is the dominant language here;


  (3) is of the opinion that such universities  will  not  clash  with  the
       transformation process, as the national Minister of Education himself
       envisages an African-language-based university or technikon;
  (4) appeals to the historically  Afrikaans  universities  to  ensure  the
       position of  Afrikaans  as  a  language  of  instruction  within  the
       framework of the stipulated policy, without excluding  non-Afrikaans-
       speaking students; and


  (5) further appeals to institutions for higher education to  develop  all
       indigenous languages with regard to higher education.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Mr Chairperson, I move as an amendment:


  That paragraph (2) be substituted by the following paragraph:


  (2) is of the opinion, however, that the  Minister,  after  consultation,
       must determine an  appropriate  place  for  at  least  one  Afrikaans
       university in an area where Afrikaans is a dominant language.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: With that amended, is there any  objection?  Mr  Van
Niekerk, I hope you will accept the amendment?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I am easy with the amendment,  except  that
I used the word ``minstens'', [at least], which  generalised  my  statement,
but I am happy with the amendment.

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution, namely:


  That the Council-


  (1) notes with appreciation that the language policy for higher education
       still offers Afrikaans room to  remain  functioning  as  an  academic
       language  and  a  language  of  instruction  while  other  indigenous
       languages are also going to be developed as academic languages;
  (2) is of the opinion, however, that the  Minister,  after  consultation,
       must determine an  appropriate  place  for  at  least  one  Afrikaans
       university in an area where Afrikaans is a dominant language;


  (3) is of the opinion that such universities  will  not  clash  with  the
       transformation process, as the national Minister of Education himself
       envisages an African-language-based university or technikon;


  (4) appeals to the historically  Afrikaans  universities  to  ensure  the

         CONDEMNATION OF POLITICISATION OF FAMINE RELIEF IN ZIMBABWE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) notes-


       (a)  the growing crisis regarding the supply of food to those in need
           in Zimbabwe, and that ZANU-PF and President Mugabe are using the
           distribution of food for political reasons;


       (b)  that the US government  has  accused  Zimbabwe  of  politicising
           famine relief and  is  working  with  other  donor  nations  and
           international food agencies in order to establish more efficient
           strategies that will ensure that food reaches those who need  it
           most; and


       (c)  that Zimbabwe has in turn accused the latest approach  from  the
           US as a ridiculous pretext to invade the country later;


  (2) wishes to state that in respect of famine relief in Zimbabwe, it is a
       moral right of donors to give and  of  all  starving  Zimbabweans  to
       receive access to food, and that politicising the  food  distribution
       process is unacceptable, if not criminal;


  (3) supports all efforts by the US and other world agencies to  establish
       more efficient strategies that will ensure equal access to  food  for
       everyone in need in Zimbabwe;


  (4) requests the Government to commit South Africa, as  a  food-supplying
       donor in the region, to any new initiatives that will help to provide
       a more equitable and fairer approach to  food  distribution  that  is
       free of any political interference in that country.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J MAHLANGU): Order!  Is  there  any
objection to the motion?  There  is  an  objection.  In  the  light  of  the
objection, the motion may not be proceeded with. The motion  without  notice
will now become a notice of motion.

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Can we record the  names
of the members who objected to the motion without notice? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Well, I hope the hon  member  is  seeing
the members who have objected.

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairperson, I can see they are ashamed  of  having  their
names in the Hansard, thank you.

            LACK OF SECURITY ON CAMPUS OF UNIVERSITY OF THE NORTH
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) notes that students at the University of the North outside  Polokwane
       are up in arms over the lack of security on campus;


  (2) further notes that this follows a spate of rapes and attempted  rapes
       at the institution recently;


  (3) believes that at least five cases of rape and seven of attempted rape
       had been reported in the past two months with no arrest; and


  (4) therefore urges the Department of Education and the campus management
       to take the necessary steps to intervene in this crisis.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        EDUCATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Mr Chairperson, I have  pleasure  in  introducing
the Education Laws Amendment Bill to this House, which seeks to  amend  five
other pieces of legislation. I do not normally choose to speak  directly  to
the many features of the legislation; I leave that to other members  of  the
House but, in this  case,  there  has  been  a  lot  of  disinformation  and
propaganda about its contents, which I need to address.

Much of this  clamour  and  noise  has  been  poorly  informed  and  overtly
political and partisan. Therefore, this must  be  dismissed.  On  the  other
hand, I must appreciate the quieter but very constructive  suggestions  made
to me by many responsible organisations,  which  have  helped  us  to  bring
before this Council a Bill  which  is  widely  supported  by  the  education
sector, despite what some may say about it.

Some of the changes are minor. It is a technical amendment  to  the  General
and Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Act. I  do  not  intend
to deal with these. Others are refinements to the workings of the  education
system, based on the  unfolding  of  our  constitutional  mandate,  and  the
realities of our schools. I draw the attention of this Council  to  what  is
actually happening on the ground.

The most important features of the legislation are as follows: an  induction
and admission age for entry into public  and  independent  schools  as  from
January 2004; secondly, provisions to establish a national curriculum and  a
system of assessment in general, further and adult basic education  also  in
public and independent schools; thirdly, to provide for the  appointment  of
intermediaries to assist learners in  the  case  of  sensitive  disciplinary
hearings - I think this is a first in Africa, if not the world  -  fourthly,
to prohibit harmful initiation practices in schools  and  further  education
and training institutions; fifthly, to  determine  a  code  of  conduct  for
members of school governing bodies;  sixthly,  to  insist  that  the  school
budget processes are made more transparent  and  accessible;  seventhly,  to
amend the procedure by which new teachers and those  who  are  returning  to
service are appointed; next, the determination of performance standards  for
teachers and finally, procedures for the  registration  of  private  further
education and training institutions.

This Bill has been through  an  extensive  consultation  process,  including
public  hearings  by  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Education  and   strong
consultation with the provinces. I am  pleased  to  say  that  many  of  the
comments were  very  positive.  Where  differences  did  emerge,  they  were
largely about the approach rather than the purpose of  the  Bill.  Very  few
constituencies, and certainly no major  ones,  contested  the  aims  of  the
Bill, and those that did tended  to  be  driven  by  conservative  religious
perspectives, by groupings that have not yet subscribed  to  the  values  of
our  nonsectarian  constitutional  state.  I  am  therefore   confident   of
widespread support in this House.

I will deal with the issues that received the most comment.  First,  let  me
explain that our need to introduce legislation on the age of  admission  and
other matters was driven by a recent Constitutional  Court  judgment,  which
found - on a  technicality  -  that  Government  policy  cannot  bind  third
parties such as independent schools. It could only bind  state  schools.  We
have, therefore, provided in  law  that,  as  from  2004,  children  may  be
admitted to Grade 1 provided they will turn six by 30 June - this is a  six-
month reduction from the present rule -  and  this  will  apply  across  the
board. So, from next year, children who are six and will  be  turning  seven
will be admitted that way.

We have allowed also for underage admission in extraordinary  circumstances.
This is constrained to ensure that this is done in a manner  that  does  not
discriminate, in other words, where the special needs of the  children  have
to be met or the  children's  own  progress  takes  place.  Until  equitable
instruments for  granting  exemptions  are  determined,  there  will  be  no
exemptions to the norm.

The determination  of  the  national  curriculum  for  general  and  further
education, and its application for public and independent schools,  is  both
necessary and reasonable. We have developed,  through  a  broad-ranging  and
lengthy process, a proudly South African national curriculum. No  curriculum
is not based on national needs and aspirations throughout the  world.  There
is no curriculum that is extraneous to the  national  needs  of  a  country.
There is, in other words, no curriculum that is entirely antiseptic  if  not
neutral. We must therefore  expect  all  our  children  to  follow  this  in
pursuit of the agreed goal for a  single  nation.  It  is  a  proudly  South
African national curriculum. We have  emphasised  at  all  times  that  this
curriculum statement comprises only minimum outcomes and standards.

The most vocal people are the ones  who  say  that  they  do  not  want  any
development that will change matters. We are not  prescribing,  compared  to
the highly authoritarian and rigid curriculum that  we  inherited  from  the
apartheid state which laid down in its details - I  say  this  as  a  former
schoolteacher - what was to be taught, how it was to  be  taught,  and  what
was to be examined. A teacher became either  a  propogandist  or  a  cipher,
depending on which particular part of  South  Africa  and  which  particular
ethnic  group  one  is  talking  about.  One  was  either  a  cipher  or   a
propogandist.

So, we have emphasised all the time that the curriculum statement  maintains
only minimum outcomes  and  standards,  and  we  are  therefore  in  no  way
prescribing to schools or teachers. I  hope  members  of  the  Council  will
change their speeches, if their thinking  is  like  that  displayed  in  the
sensational article by a very forgettable DP member from  Gauteng  who  says
that this is a process of indoctrination. [Interjections.] We  have  learned
our lessons. [Interjections.] Those who say yes must either listen  or  read
what is in the Bill itself.

We  are  not  telling  teachers  how  to  teach  either.  That  is   totally
contradictory to outcomes-based education, because the  process  is  a  very
collective process. I shall say this for the first time - I say this in  the
presence of Mr Gaum, the MEC for Education in  the  Western  Cape,  who  has
been very helpful in this. We must also, through this process, find out  who
are the really bright children. We  must  emphasise  that,  because  in  the
present process of learning by  heart  and  learning  by  rote,  the  really
bright children are not identified.  The  really  bright  children  are  not
those who get 99% in mathematics, which  is  largely  regurgitation  without
understanding. We are going to set out now to find out, in all our  schools,
who the really bright children are. That will  come  out  through  the  very
organised, collective method of  learning  and  teaching  through  outcomes-
based education to draw - as the preamble to our Constitution says - on  the
talents and capacities of all our people. As  professionals,  teachers  will
develop the learning programmes. They will develop them where children  will
follow in order to achieve the prescribed outcomes.
On the other hand, there must be a framework. After all, if no framework  is
laid down, there might be anarchy. Exactly what  do  our  children  achieve?
That is why, with the co-operation of the Council  of  Education  Ministers,
we are saying that unlike what happened with the introduction  of  outcomes-
based education, there must be assessment in Grades 3, 6, 9 and 12. It  will
start  earlier  but  assessments  were  wrong.  That  is  why,  through  the
assessments, we will be able to work out whether our children  are  literate
and numerate by the end of Grade 3. It has been particularly  recognised  in
advanced democratic countries that, in  Western  European  countries,  there
are children who cannot read and write at the age of  12.  We  do  not  want
that to happen. That is  why  there  will  be  an  assessment  system.  This
applies, therefore, to the assessment of learner achievement.

Our simple wish is to have a national framework for assessment, a  framework
which will allow us to publish a national set of results, confident  in  the
knowledge that these are based on common processes and equivalent  standards
throughout South Africa. This  will  not  stifle  innovation  in  regard  to
assessment  procedures,  and  is  certainly  no  threat  to  the  future  of
legitimate assessment bodies, which have worked closely with us  to  support
and develop the assessment of the national curriculum.

I  just  received,  last  week,  the  report  of  this  investigation   into
assessment bodies, and in the new year I hope we will have a debate in  this
Council on assessment in education. At the same time, we  cannot  allow  the
existence of international  agencies  which  offer  pupils  a  qualification
based on a foreign syllabus, whose dubious value only becomes apparent  once
it is tested in the job place or with a  higher  education  institution.  We
must protect against this form of exploitation. I  want  to  make  it  quite
clear that we are not prescribing what is to be taught, particularly in  the
context of the new National Curriculum Statement for Grades R to 9.

Secondly, the need  to  review  the  process  for  the  appointment  of  new
teachers and those returning after a  break  has  been  necessary  for  some
time. This is even more urgent now in the context of HIV/Aids. We  currently
have a very cumbersome and lengthy process for the appointment of  teachers.
I get innumerable letters from  young  people  who  recently  graduated  and
finished their courses saying that they cannot get jobs. They are  able  and
enthusiastic. There are white teachers who want to  work  in  townships  who
are not able to get  placements.  This  cumbersome  system  is  not  in  the
interest of either the schools or the applicants.

Many schools, particularly those in the rural areas and townships,  fail  to
attract suitably qualified candidates  for  advertised  jobs,  leaving  them
with large numbers of unfilled vacancies. At the  same  time,  students  are
required to complete numerous applications, send them to schools which  they
do not know, and possibly attend  a  series  of  interviews,  which  can  be
rather intimidating. This procedure does nobody any  favours,  and  advances
the rapid deployment of teachers,  as  required  in  the  face  of  possible
teacher shortages.

In addition, and this is a serious matter, we do have  serious  problems  of
racial representativity in school staffrooms. We are talking about 12  years
since the process began in 1990. All of us agree that it must be  addressed.
However, members will notice that we  have  not  fixed  quotas  for  schools
under the equity legislation, because a  school  cannot  be  the  basis  for
that. So, after five years, school governing bodies have failed to make  use
of their extensive powers  to  promote  the  necessary  changes  to  recruit
people from outside the narrow cultural and racial  bounds  of  the  school.
This phenomenon is not limited to former  model-C  schools.  It  is  also  a
feature of our township schools who tend to be resentful of  what  they  see
as outsiders getting their jobs.

This form of xenophobia is not conducive to our efforts to  build  a  united
and  diverse  nation  celebrating  our  diversity.  Therefore,  we  need  to
intervene by making some appointments to schools.  Let  us  be  quite  clear
about this. The provisions do not limit the powers of  governing  bodies  in
any way. Those who  wish  to  use  the  existing  procedures  in  recruiting
teachers are free to do so.  Applicants,  including  first-time  applicants,
are free to apply directly to schools for jobs.

Where these processes are effective, they can  continue.  If  they  are  not
effective, then what follows is the alternative route that we have  proposed
for those schools and applicants who are  not  well-served  by  the  current
approach. The new system  provides  for  one  application  to  the  relevant
provincial  department  of  education,  which  will  match  applications  to
vacancies, and the vacancies will be determined by the governing bodies  and
their specifications and needs will be identified by the  governing  bodies.
Then the department will make offers to suitably qualified applicants.

By the way, I should not really have to say so, but given the state  of  the
opposition and its far-fetched allegations, including  the  former  MEC  for
education in the Western Cape, who wrote an  extraordinary  article  in  the
Star last week, I must state categorically that no teacher will be  deployed
against his or her will to a school. It will  not  happen  to  any  teacher.
Applicants will be offered a job at a  particular  school,  which  they  are
free to accept or decline, as with any other job. We  cannot  employ  people
and then decide where they will work. That is  what  happened  to  me  as  a
schoolteacher in KwaZulu-Natal where one was  sent  to  a  school  that  was
determined by those extraordinary experts in Pietermaritzburg at that  time.
I  was  sent  to  a  school  to  teach,  regardless  of  my  own  needs  and
requirements. That hon member should  not  shake  his  head.  That  was  the
practice then. I am talking about a long time ago, before  that  member  was
born. I can understand that before the member was born, the  world  was  not
aware of any facts then.

We cannot employ people against their will. I  am  sure  many  members  here
will be glad if their jobs were near their homes. My first job was not  near
my home. [Interjections.] That hon member should please  not  be  ludicrous.
One sees these loud guffaws. They pass as wit  and  imagination.  I  do  not
mind the lack of decorum. It is the lack of imagination that I object to.
One has to want to work near one's home and serve the institution  that  one
really believes in. Only in cases where the province  has  invested  bursary
money in the training of a teacher might there be limitation of  the  powers
of governing bodies. This is because, increasingly, provinces  -  I  see  in
the newspapers today that Adv Gaum has said that they  are  going  to  offer
bursaries to teachers - give bursaries. It is only when bursaries are  given
that the powers will be limited. It is quite right.  Gauteng,  for  example,
is giving bursaries for people who want to take up mathematics and  science.
There is a great  lack  in  all  our  schools.  Even  in  these  cases,  the
department will be required to consult with the governing body in regard  to
the requirements of the posts before making any appointment.

So, this provision will only apply to a limited category  of  teachers,  and
should not be seen as a threat to the functions of school governing  bodies.
We cannot spend public money on training teachers and then  find  that  they
are not being appointed by governing bodies in schools where they  are  most
needed.

I come to the third point. The  development  of  performance  standards  for
teachers rises from the incapacity code  which  this  Council  approved  two
years ago. At the  time,  I  was  keen  to  prescribe  these  standards  for
incapacity where a teacher was not able to perform his or her  work.  I  was
persuaded that these should be  collectively  negotiated  with  the  unions.
This was the capacity standards that were left out. I agreed to allow for  a
12-month period for this to happen, after which I  indicated  that  I  would
return to Parliament if no agreement had been reached. It is now  two  years
since then, and no agreement has been reached.

I intend, therefore, to now determine these  standards  of  incompetence  in
teachers. No one can tolerate a situation where teachers who  are  incapable
of doing their job are allowed to  continue  teaching.  That  is  why  I  am
laying a lot of emphasis on higher education and the  quality  of  teaching.
What our children are getting should be the best, and not, in fact, the  15%
only who are able to pass the examinations because they  revise  effectively
for a number of reasons.

Then there is the banning of harmful  initiation  practices,  which  may  be
separated from the provision  of  positive  orientation  programmes  in  our
institutions. We have therefore provided a very clear definition, and  there
should be no confusion about  the  matter  as  to  the  distinction  between
orientation  programmes  and  initiation  ceremonies.   Harmful   initiation
endangers the mental and physical health of the learner, and undermines  the
intrinsic worth of individuals. This is  particularly  important  since  our
schools are now getting increasingly integrated. There are oppositions of  a
cultural nature to some of the initiation ceremonies, and hon  members  have
to look at some of the initiation ceremonies, as I  have  done,  to  realise
the bizarre nature, which undoubtedly harms our pupils.

When  any  such  initiation  occurs,  teachers  may  be  charged  under  the
Employment of Educators Act.  Other  participants  may  have  civil  actions
brought against them. Let there be no doubt about how we feel in  regard  to
practices which strip the dignity and humanity of our children in  the  name
of alleged tradition which, invariably, is five or six years old.

Finally, I  come  to  the  registration  of  private  providers  of  further
education and training. Providers are those backstreet people who  say  they
will give certificates and diplomas which  are  not  registered,  and  where
employment cannot take place. This registration  is  urgently  required.  We
have seen a dramatic increase in the number of private  institutions.  There
are hundreds and hundreds of them which often charge  exorbitant  fees,  and
often  provide  very  poor  quality  tuition.  The  Ministry  of  Education,
therefore, has the responsibility to regulate this sector.

Once again, we are meeting a social evil. We are trying to cure a  mischief.
The opponents of this say that we are trying  to  centralise  matters.  What
they do not care about is that the  unregulated  private  further  education
and training sector affects the large majority of  young  black  people  and
the poorest of the poor are often  paying  up  to  R12  000  a  year  for  a
certificate which is totally meaningless. It is the  state's  duty  to  play
the role of a nanny - a good nanny, not one who pinches the child  who  then
cries in front of the mother, and then the nanny takes over the role of  the
mother. We have a responsibility for minimum standards. The market  has  not
regulated itself. This is a myth. The market cannot  regulate  itself.  That
is the important thing. We cannot allow the market to  exploit  gullible  or
desperate parents and desperate students, many of  whom,  as  I  have  said,
make  huge  sacrifices  to  further  their  studies  in  these  money-making
institutions. They are not really educational institutions.

Separating the sheep  from  the  goats  will  therefore  ensure  that  these
institutions make an educational contribution. We are also introducing  some
necessary amendments to our legislation, built on our growing experience  of
running the schools. They will be part of the continuing improvement.  I  am
very pleased to say that the dysfunctional schools that I saw in  1999  have
been replaced by a new spirit and a new approach.

I have also announced here today - there is no reason why  the  NCOP  cannot
get a scoop - that  I  am  undertaking  a  comprehensive  review  of  school
governance and school governing bodies, an honest assessment of what  it  is
that they are doing or not doing, where it is working and where  it  is  not
working, and where and why. I have been presented with too much  evidence  -
nearly all anecdotal,  I  must  say  -  of  weak  and  inappropriate  school
governance, of  language  policies  that  do  not  meet  the  needs  of  the
community, of governing bodies that are  more  concerned  with  running  the
schools rather than assisting with the administration  of  the  schools.  We
must find out what the exact factual position is.

I hope members of this Council will, therefore, take into account  the  need
to make submissions of their own, however anecdotal  they  may  be,  however
limited they may be and write directly to me. We are setting up a very  good
small body with a reference group which will be larger. I will look at  this
in terms of the propriety of including members of this Council  and  members
from the other House, if it is possible, to form part of a larger  reference
group.

We cannot afford weak  links,  particularly  since  after  2004  the  school
nutrition and feeding scheme will be  transferred  to  schools  and  to  the
Department of Education. The school governing body  and  the  mammas  around
the school governing body will organise the school feeding scheme.

There are those who have set themselves up  as  the  supposed  defenders  of
school governing bodies. I would like to say that  the  ANC  introduced  the
school governing bodies with the most far-reaching powers. I have looked  at
about 35 or 40 examples of  national  legislation  in  other  parts  of  the
world. There is no other country  that  has  conferred  so  much  power  and
authority to the school governing bodies. We must try to find out how it  is
working. My purpose is  not  to  weaken  the  school  governing  bodies.  My
purpose is to see whether they are functioning in the way that we want  them
to.

I would like to say that I look forward to submissions  on  the  matter.  We
may hold public hearings outside the portfolio committee  and  the  standing
committee so we can get  it  to  the  people  -  particularly  since  public
hearings held under the auspices of  the  NCOP  and  that  of  the  National
Assembly draw the usual crowd that give public submissions. It tends  to  be
the usual group of people, the usual  advocates,  and  those  who  have  the
capacity to get lawyers to draft their submissions. I think,  in  this  kind
of thing, we must take it right out to  the  countryside,  and  take  it  to
where  the  people  are,  who  are  not  necessarily  able  to  write  their
submissions, but whose contributions are as valid, in my  view,  as  anybody
else's. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members,  hon  delegates  from
the provinces, maybe before one says anything, it would  be  good  to  thank
the committee members, particularly for their role during the processing  of
the Bills. I also want to extend a word of thanks to the provinces  for  the
way that they dealt with the  Bill  before  us.  We  also  went  for  public
hearings to the provinces and I think we did so in real style.

Our ANC-led Government  has  introduced  a  comprehensive  policy  aimed  at
providing  young  South  Africans   with   equal   and   quality   education
opportunities and preparing them for  the  social  and  economic  challenges
facing the country.  Despite  enormous  backlogs,  we  have  passed  various
pieces of anti-poverty legislation  to  effect  change  and  improvement  in
previously disadvantaged areas and to bring about a better life for all  our
learners in our schools.

The Bill before  us  today  is  a  product  of  our  commitment  to  further
dismantling the remaining vestiges of the past. It has been endorsed by  the
Council  of  Education  Ministers,  of  which  our  MECs  are  members,  and
therefore has the full approval of the provinces. It is  merely  a  revision
of existing legislation.
The  Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill  seeks  to  amend   five   pieces   of
legislation, of which some are minor technical amendments.  The  outstanding
amendments - perhaps one of two - are designed to  close  loopholes  in  the
governing framework and  was  necessitated  when  the  Constitutional  Court
ruled on the Talya Harris case. This case centred on the  admission  age  at
which a child should start Grade 1 in a private school.  In  our  endeavours
to respect and uphold the  Constitution,  we  seek  to  do  what  the  court
suggested we  should  do,  that  is,  to  ensure  that  national  policy  is
expressed in legislation. Hence we have this amendment to the South  African
Schools Act, which will harmonise the admission  age  to  Grade  1  in  both
public and private schools.  The  admission  age  is  thus  lowered  by  six
months. The amendment removes undue pressure from the provinces and in  this
respect we are guided by section 28(2) of the Constitution, which reads:


  A child's best interests are of  paramount  importance  in  every  matter
  concerning the child.

The Bill also empowers the Minister to determine a national  curriculum  and
assessment of learners' achievements  to  determine  minimum  standards  and
outcomes, as required by the Constitution. Already we have seen how  overtly
DA-sympathetic heads have given sinister interpretations on  this.  However,
we in the ANC are of one  mind,  that  curriculum  policy  is  an  important
instrument to ensure that the constitutional responsibility  of  independent
schools to provide education better than or equivalent  to  that  of  public
schools is taken care of.

All schools should follow a national curriculum.  We  believe  that  various
agencies, including departments and accredited independent  bodies,  have  a
role to play in learner assessment, but this must be exercised within a  co-
ordinated framework. This will enable us to compare results  internally  and
for our results to be internationally benchmarked.

The rest of the amendments are in line with existing  policy  and  we  fully
support them. It is our view that  the  national  Education  Laws  Amendment
Bill starts to answer the question President Mbeki posed to the nation  nine
months ago, namely -


  ... whether what we are doing as the legislature, the executive  and  the
  judiciary, as well as the fourth estate, is  helping  to  lift  from  the
  shoulders  of  our  people  the  intolerable  burden   of   poverty   and
  underdevelopment.

We are saying the Bill starts to answer this question, because  even  though
we are making purposeful strides, we are mindful that there are  indeed  low
areas  of  performance  and  needs  which  are  forever  competing  for  our
attention.

The Bill will ensure that Government and we can  make  proper  intervention,
where necessary, with regard to transformation, equity, allocation of  human
and financial resources, and improvement in the quality of teaching.

In conclusion, criticism of the Bill was to be expected in  the  context  of
the morally indefensible policy of the past, of which the evidence is  still
all around us. The criticism is consistent with this country's  history  and
the present situation of so few with so much,  depriving  so  many  with  so
little.

We support this Bill that should be endorsed by this House. [Applause.]

Mnr F ADAMS: Agb Voorsitter,  Ministers  en  lede  van  die  Huis,  daar  is
heelparty bepalings in die wetgewing waarmee die Nuwe NP geen  probleem  het
nie en wat ons ten volle kan steun.

Ons is egter veral besorgd oor klousule 10, wat  in  werklikheid  die  magte
van bestuursliggame erodeer. Hoewel ons begrip het vir die feit dat daar  'n
gelyke verspreiding van gekwalifiseerde onderwysers oor die land  heen  moet
wees en dat nuwe onderwysers so gou moontlik aangestel  moet  word,  is  die
wyse waarop  hierdie  wetsontwerp  die  doelwit  probeer  bereik,  verkeerd.
Aansporing vir onderwysers  om  op  die  platteland  onderwys  te  gee,  sou
byvoorbeeld 'n baie beter opsie gewees het.

In die saak tussen die beheerraad van die Settlers Hoër Landbouskool en  die
hoof van die Departement van Onderwys van die Limpopo  provinsie,  waar  die
departement opdrag gegee is om die genomineerde van die beheerraad weer  aan
te stel, het regter Bertelsmann 'n baie belangrike beginsel  daargestel.  Hy
het gesê, en ek haal aan:


  Hoe belangrik die regte van opvoeders ook al is, en in  besonder  diegene
  wat aan voorheen benadeelde gemeenskappe behoort,  moet  die  oorwig  van
  kinders se regte en belange nie misgekyk word nie.

Elke stukkie wetgewing oor onderwys behoort gelei te word  deur  wat  regter
Bertelsmann na verwys het as die ``oorwig van  kinders  se  regte''.  Gemeet
teen hierdie beginselriglyn het die inhoud van klousule 10 tekortgeskiet.

'n  Verdere  logiese  afleiding  van  sy  uitspraak  is  dat  'n  skool   se
beheerliggaam by uitstek geskik is om te besluit wat  in  die  beste  belang
van die kind is. Ek wil dan ook net byvoeg dat ekself op  die  beheerliggaam
van 'n skool dien.

Lyfstraf word onder andere deur klousules 15 en 28 verbied. Ek vra  nie  dat
lyfstraf weer ingestel moet word nie. Al wat ek weet, is dat 'n  gebrek  aan
dissipline dit feitlik vir onderwysers onmoontlik maak om hulle  dagtaak  na
behore te vervul.

Volgens prof Izak Oosthuizen van die Potchefstroomse  Universiteit,  wat  'n
omvattende studie in dié verband gedoen het, is dissipline  in  skole  besig
om landwyd ineen te stort. Volgens hom is die leemte wat gelaat is deur  die
verbod  op  lyfstraf  nog  nie  na  behore  deur  alternatiewe  dissiplinêre
maatreëls gevul nie.

Miskien is daar redes hiervoor. [O]f onderwysers is  nie  behoorlik  ingelig
oor alternatiewe strafmaatreëls, soos uiteengesit in 'n handleiding van  die
departement nie, óf die alternatiewe maatreëls help nie.

Ek stem nie saam met die gevolgtrekking in die handleiding dat lyfstraf  lei
tot groeiende sosiale geweld nie. Hulle het my op  skool  amper  doodgeslaan
en ek kan nie onthou dat ek al ooit skuldig  was  aan  sosiale  geweld  nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Miskien moet  die  Minister  ondersoek  instel  oor  die  ineenstorting  van
dissipline op skoolvlak en die suksesvolle implementering al dan nie van  'n
handleiding oor alternatiewe strafmaatreëls.

Respek is een van die waardes wat  in  die  hersiene  kurrikulum  beklemtoon
word. Miskien moet dit juis gekwalifiseer word as respek vir  gesag  wat  op
die ou end kan help dat dissipline op skoolvlak herstel word.

Ter afsluiting, as  party  steun  die  Nuwe  NP  nie  die  wetsontwerp  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson, Ministers and members of the House, there  are
several provisions in this piece of Legislation with which the  New  NP  has
no problem, and that we can totally support.

However, we are very concerned about clause 10, that in reality  erodes  the
powers of governing bodies. Even though we have  an  understanding  for  the
fact that there should  be  an  equal  distribution  of  qualified  teachers
throughout the country and that new teachers should be appointed as soon  as
possible, the manner in which this Bill attempts to achieve  this  objective
is wrong. Incentives for teachers to teach  in  rural  areas,  for  example,
would have been a better option.

In the case between the governing body of the Settlers  Higher  Agricultural
School and the principal from the Department of  Education  of  the  Limpopo
province, where the department was instructed  to  reappoint  the  nominated
person from the governing body,  Judge  Bertelsmann  set  a  very  important
principle. He said, and I quote:


  No matter how important the rights of educators are,  and  in  particular
  those from previously disadvantaged communities, the import of the rights
  of children and their interests should not be overlooked.

Every piece of legislation about education should be guided  by  what  Judge
Bertelsmann referred to  as  the  ``import  of  the  rights  of  children''.
Measured against this principled guideline  the  content  of  clause  10  is
inadequate.

A further logical conclusion of his judgment is that the school's  governing
body is pre-eminently qualified to decide what is in the  best  interest  of
the child. I would also then like to add that I too serve on  the  governing
body of a school.

Corporal punishment, inter alia, is prohibited by clauses 15 and  28.  I  do
not ask that corporal punishment be reinstituted. All I know is that a  lack
of discipline makes it practically impossible for teachers to  fulfil  their
daily task as they should.

According to Prof Izak Oosthuizen from  the  Potchefstroom  University,  who
conducted a  thorough  study  in  this  regard,  discipline  in  schools  is
beginning to collapse throughout the country.  According  to  him  the  void
that has been left by the prohibition on corporal punishment  has  not  been
adequately filled by alternative disciplinary measures.

Perhaps there are  reasons  for  this.  Either  teachers  are  not  properly
informed of alternative punitive measures, as outlined in the guide  of  the
department, or the alternative measures do not help.

I do not agree with the conclusion in the handbook that corporal  punishment
will lead to increased social violence. They practically beat  me  to  death
at school and I cannot remember that I  have  ever  been  guilty  of  social
violence. [Interjections.]

Perhaps the Minister  should  investigate  the  collapse  of  discipline  at
school level and the successful  implementation,  or  not,  of  a  guide  on
alternative punitive measures.

Respect is one of the  values  that  must  be  emphasised  in  the  reviewed
curriculum. Perhaps it should be specifically qualified that it  is  respect
for authority that might in the end contribute to  restoring  discipline  at
school level.

In conclusion, the New NP as a party does not support this Bill.]

Ms L N JAJULA: Mr Chairman, hon members, ladies and gentlemen,  the  Eastern
Cape rises to commend the hon the  Minister  for  coming  up  with  such  an
amendment  and  specifically   for   taking   the   process   of   education
transformation forward in South Africa.

Basically, it is based on an ANC policy crafted in  the  Kliptown  gathering
which took place in 1955  to  transform  education  in  South  Africa.  This
formed the basic document just before the national election in 1994.
It is very important for each one of us to realise  that  education  is  the
cornerstone of life.  Furthermore,  it  is  the  right  of  everyone  to  be
educated. We appreciate the  response  and  the  lowering  of  the  age  for
admission of children specifically. The vast majority of children cannot  be
barred from entering school at an early age.

The present curriculum is one that provides and facilitates  learner-centred
education, instead of an education that  is  actually  teacher-centred.  The
outcomes-based education programme will  cause  most  students  to  be  more
assertive and realise their  talents.  They  will  then  prosper  in  better
careers during their lives.

The Eastern Cape believes that the amendment  which  looks  at  the  present
school governing bodies is quite relevant. But I  think  we  need  to  fast-
track the training of school governing bodies. We call upon the  Association
of School Governing Bodies to fast-track this process  in  order  to  ensure
that the friction and conflict between administration and management,  owing
to less-informed school governing bodies, will come to an end.

The role of a school governing body is  very  important.  It  forms  a  bond
between the school and  the  educators,  and  between  the  school  and  the
family. We believe that education belongs to all  social  institutions,  not
only the school.

The prohibition of corporal punishment is well reflected  in  this  amending
Bill, but it is a matter of concern that it is  still  implemented  in  most
schools. This has to come to an end. The people are ignoring  the  law,  and
the implementation of this irregular and improper activity in  the  life  of
any person is actually dehumanising to that  particular  person  and  has  a
negative physical, emotional and spiritual  impact,  which  has  a  negative
effect on the education system itself. This has to come to an end.

We believe that if clear guidelines and monitoring  mechanisms  are  put  in
place to expose the people who are  continuing  with  these  activities,  we
will be able to achieve better concentration  for  those  in  the  education
system.

In conclusion, we believe that it is time for each South African to  realise
that education is a broad concern. It does not rest in the classrooms  only,
but rests with each one of us. In  order  for  education  to  succeed,  each
social  institution  has  to  make  sure  that  it  has  a  programme  which
facilitates and  assists  the  education  system  at  home,  in  church  and
everywhere. In that way we will be  able  to  achieve  better  results.  The
results we are talking about, which will be out on 26 December, are not  the
product of only one person. It should be the  product  of  every  person  in
South Africa.

It is not the teacher's role to make sure that the child  behaves.  Children
need to behave everywhere. They need to have  respect  for  the  environment
and education. The parents themselves, the relatives, friends and  guardians
should see to it  that  the  child  respects  society  first,  in  order  to
concentrate in class. We have  to  realise  that  education  cannot  succeed
unless each one  of  us  takes  a  positive  stand,  to  say  that  we  will
contribute on a daily basis to transforming what is  a  lost  generation  in
South Africa. In this way we will restore  the  fibre  and  dignity  of  our
society. [Applause.]

Mnu  H  T  SOGONI:  Sihlalo,  Mphathiswa   namalungu   abekekileyo,   ndithi
mandivakalise inkxaso ye-UDM kulo Mthetho  uqulethe  intlaninge  yezihlomelo
kwizigaba  ezithile  kwimithetho  yezemfundo  eyahluka-hlukeneyo.   Sihlalo,
linyathelo  elincomekayo  nelisifudusela  phambili   ukuqingqwa   kweminyaka
yokwamkelwa  komfundi  osaqalayo  esikolweni  ngohlobo  lokuba  umzali   abe
nokuzikhethela ixesha lokungena  komntwana  esikolweni  nangona  kuxhomekeke
ekubeni ukulungele kangakanani na phofu ukuqalisa isikolo.

Noxa sisiphumeza esi sihlomelo, sikwathabathele ingqalelo  isiphakamiso  se-
SADTU neNational  Association  of  Governing  Bodies  esibongoza  ukuba  esi
sihlomelo  sixhaswe  zizixhobo  zokufunda  ezaneleyo  kuwo   onke   amabanga
andulela ibanga lokuqala uGrade  R  ukuze  kuxhamle  uwonke-wonke,  ungavuzi
kuphela  abantwana  abambalwa  bezinhanha,  abanazo   iimpiko   zokufudusela
abantwana bazo kuloo maziko anazo zonke izinto. I-UDM  iyasixhasa  kananjalo
isihlomelelo sokuba  umzali  womfundi  abekho  buqu  okanye  amelwe  ngulowo
amtyumbileyo   ngexesha   loluleko-similo   kumfundi.   Ibubulumko   nophawu
lobulungisa  kananjalo  Sihlalo,  ukuba   umfundi   oneminyaka   engaphantsi
kwelishumi elinesibhozo ancediswe ngumntu ofanelekileyo,  mhlawumbi  ngamava
nolwazi, xa sukuba umfundi lowo enika ubungqina kwimicimbi  yoluleko.  Kambe
noxa kunjalo ndinoluvo oluqinileyo  oluthi,  le  nyhweba  isaza  kuxhanyulwa
ngabambalwa kuphela.

Kumava  endinawo,  amaqumrhu  olawulo-zikolo  phaya  kwiindawo  zabantsundu,
ingakumbi ezilalini, akanayo esandleni le mithetho  siyiqulunqa  apha.  Noxa
sele ikho, iba lolunye uxanduva ukwenza  amaqumrhu  olawulo-zikolo  akuqonde
okuqulethwe yile mithetho. Ngako oko  nathi  malungu  eNdlu  yoWiso-Mthetho,
sinomthwalo wokufundisa abantu ngale mithetho ingakumbi  amaqumrhu  olawulo-
zikolo nabazali.

Isisithethe  sezikolo  phantse  kuzo  zonke  iintlanga  kweli  lizwe   ukuba
abafundi abatsha esikolweni baqheliswe intlalo  nenkqubo  yesikolo  esitsha.
Ezinye  zeendlela  zokubangenisa  ekhaya  sezafana  nokungathi  ziyinxalenye
yemithetho nenkqubo evunyiweyo  sisikolo.  Ikwaluxanduva  lukaRhulumente  ke
ngoko ukukhusela abafundi  kwimikhwa  ebathoba  isidima,  ibavise  ubuhlungu
emzimbeni okanye ibakhubekise emphefumlweni.  Isihlomelo  somthetho  onqanda
impatheko-mbi kubafundi siyinika  inkxaso  epheleleyo  ke  thina.  Kambe  ke
nakuso esi sigaba somthetho, malenziwe iphulo  elaneleyo  lokuba  lufikelele
ulwazi kwabo ulungiselele ukubanceda lo mthetho,  kungenjalo  uya  kuphelela
kule miqulu ubhalwe kuyo ungayenzi umsebenzi wawo. (Translation of  isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon Members, I would  like  to
express the UDM's  support  for  this  Bill,  which  includes  a  number  of
amendments pertaining to the different aspects  of  education.  Chairperson,
the move to allow parents to choose the right time  for  their  children  to
start  school  is  commendable  even  though  that  is  dependable  on   the
development of the child and whether he or she is ready for that.

Although we support this amendment, we would also  consider  very  carefully
the recommendations of SADTU  and  the  National  Association  of  Governing
Bodies, who are also asking that  this  amendment  be  supported  by  enough
teaching equipment in all grades that are before Grade R so  that  everybody
can benefit, not only children of rich people who can afford to  take  their
children to schools that are well equipped.  The  UDM  supports  the  clause
that states that a parent should be present or at least  represented  during
a disciplinary hearing. It is also a wise undertaking, Chairperson,  that  a
learner who is under 18  years  should  be  represented  by  an  appropriate
person who is perhaps more experienced when he or she is giving evidence  in
a disciplinary hearing. Notwithstanding  that,  I  have  a  view  that  that
opportunity will only benefit a few.

In my experience, school governing bodies in black  communities,  especially
in rural areas, do not know about these laws we are  discussing  here.  Even
though there  may  be  legislation,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  school
governing bodies to acquaint themselves with it. As members of  this  House,
we have a responsibility to educate school governing bodies and  parents  so
that they can understand the laws.

In almost every school of every racial group in this country  it  is  common
to find the  practice  of  ``initiation''  of  new  learners.  Some  of  the
activities are so common that one may think that they have  been  officially
adopted by the schools. It is the responsibility of  Government  to  protect
learners and students from practices that lower their dignity and hurt  them
emotionally and physically. We strongly support the  Bill,  which  seeks  to
prevent the ill-treatment of learners by others at  schools.  However,  even
with this legislation, there should be an effort to disseminate  information
to those that are most affected by these laws,  because  if  that  does  not
happen, the laws we make will just remain in the big  books  in  which  they
are recorded and not be implemented.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Can  I  just
request the table staff to check what is happening with the  interpretation.
At times it goes off, at times it is on. So the hon the Minister  and  other
members cannot hear as  well.  Could  you  please  pay  attention  to  that?
Apparently there is a problem with the sound. Continue, hon member.

Mnu H T  SOGONI:  Mphathiswa,  ligalelo  elikhulu  kananjalo  ukuba  kusekwe
umgaqo-nkqubo ngokuziphatha  kwamalungu  equmrhu  lolawulo-zikolo  ngenjongo
yokuphucula  umgangatho  wokulawulwa  kwazo.  Ndithetha  nje   e-BC   Senior
Secondary School  eMzimkhulu,  eMpuma  Koloni  abafundi  bancame  bazicelela
ngokwabo   abaphicothi-zincwadi   emva   kokuba   iqumrhu    lolawulo-sikolo
libanyevulele labatyhola ngokuba bayazigqatsa, basukela into ekude  nabo  xa
bebecela  ukuba  kungenelelwe  ukuze  inqununu  yesikolo  nomabhalane   wayo
benziwe banike ingcaciso ethe vetshe ngokusetyenziswa kwemali. Ngale  ndlela
Sihlalo, ndicinga ukuba kusekude engqinibeni  xa  kusekho  amalungu  equmrhu
lolawulo-sikolo  athengisa  ngenyaniso  ukuze  akhusele  inqununu   ephantsi
kwesityholo esibi sotyiwo-mali.

Esona  sihlomelo  esithe  sazala  impikiswano  enkulu  kwabaninzi,  sisigaba
seshumi salo Mthetho uYilwayo. Kunoluvo oluqinileyo kwabanye  bethu  oluthi,
ukunika umqeshi  igunya  lokuqesha  abefundisi-ntsapho  abasaqalayo  kwanabo
babuyela kwingqesho emva  konyaka  nangaphezulu,  oko  kukuhluthwa  kwegunya
lokuqesha lamalungu  equmrhu  lolawulo-zikolo.  Nakwiphondo  leMpuma  Koloni
beluqinile olu luvo ngexesha siwugwadla  lo  Mthetho,  kodwa  kuthe  ngokuye
singena nzulu engxoxweni, zehla izibilini satsho sasamkela esi sihlomelo. I-
UDM ikholelwa kakhulu ekubeni kwiimeko zengqesho ebezifudula  izezabantsundu
bodwa, ingakumbi phaya ezilalini,  amaqumrhu  olawulo-zikolo  akalisebenzisi
eli gunya. Eneneni kubonakala ngathi akazi ukuba analo.  Endaweni  yoko  eli
gunya  lixhanyulwa  yinqununu  yesikolo  kuphela  ize   isebenzise   iqumrhu
lolawulo-sikolo ukushicilela oko kusisigqibo  sayo.  Ngamanye  amaxesha  eli
gunya lisetyenziswa kakubi ngokuqesha abahlobo nezihlobo, ngamanye  amaxesha
kuqeshwe ngokunyobisa okanye kuqeshwe ngomthetho wepolitiki.  Ngako  ke  esi
sihlomelo  sigunyazisa  umqeshi  ukuba   aqeshe   sinezizathu   ezincomekayo
nangaphezulu  kwezigxekekayo  ingakumbi   xa   siqwalasela   ukuba   umqeshi
uyabonisana nequmrhu lolawulo-sikolo nangona  eqesha  ngaphandle  kwezincomo
zalo.

Elokugqibela  Sihlalo,  mandidlulise  ilizwi  lokubulela  kwiSebe   leMfundo
ngomonde nangobuchule bokunika ingcaciso ngamasolotya  athile  abe  nobuzaza
ngexesha lo mthetho besiwugwadla ekomitini phambi  kokuba  size  nawo  kwesi
sigqeba.  Ngamafuphi  Mhlalingaphambili,   i-UDM   iyawuxhasa   lo   Mthetho
uYilwayo. Enkosi. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Minister, the drafting of a code  of  conduct  for  members  of  school
governing bodies with the view to developing standards of  governance  is  a
commendable exercise. As I speak, at  the  BC  Senior  Secondary  School  at
Mzimkhulu in the Eastern Cape, learners requested an audit of  the  school's
financial statements. The governing body accused them of being  too  forward
when they asked that the principal of the school and the secretary be  asked
to account for school funds. Chairperson, I think  that  we  are  still  far
from done if there are still members of school governing bodies who  do  not
stand for truth and transparency, but  instead  protect  a  principal  of  a
school that is alleged to have embezzled school funds.

Clause 10 of this Bill has been faced with a lot of criticism.  Some  of  us
have the strong view that giving the  employer  the  right  to  appoint  new
teachers and those that go back to teaching after  a  break  of  a  year  or
more, is directed at removing  the  power  of  school  governing  bodies  to
appoint new incumbents. The Eastern Cape also held this view  when  we  were
still deliberating on this Bill, but as we deliberated  on  it  further,  we
began to understand its implications and thus welcome the amendment.

The UDM strongly believes that because of the conditions under  which  black
people were employed, especially in rural areas, governing bodies do no  use
their authority. It honestly looks as if they are  not  going  to  have  it.
Instead, it is the school principal only who seems to have  all  the  powers
and then uses the governing bodies to  rubberstamp  his  or  her  decisions.
Sometimes this power is abused by practising nepotism or bribery or one  may
even  find  political  appointments.  One  could  therefore  come   to   the
conclusion that the right of the employer  to  make  appointments  has  more
credit, especially when we look at the fact that the employer consults  with
the school governing body, even though the employer may not  consider  their
recommendations.

Furthermore, Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  hon  Minister  of
Education for his  dedication  and  expertise  in  explaining  the  critical
aspects of this Bill when we were discussing it as committee before  tabling
it in this House. In short, Chairperson, the UDM supports this  Bill.  Thank
you.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): I  must  apologise.  A
lot of the member's speech did not have an  interpretation.  I  am  not  too
sure where the problem is, whether the problem  is  with  the  sound  system
which  could  not  reach  the  interpreters,  or  whether  it  is  with  the
interpreters themselves. Can I request the table staff to  attend  to  these
matters, because we are debating serious issues here and other  members  who
could not hear the other language have the right to  an  interpretation,  so
that they can hear exactly what the member is saying. I would really  appeal
to the table staff to look at this as a matter of  urgency.  Apparently  the
system is now working properly.

Prof M N KHUBISA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, first and  foremost,  let  me
begin by commending the  hon  the  Minister  for  his  effort  to  transform
education in our country. I wish to kickstart my input in this  debate  with
the wise words of Waldo Emerson, and I quote:


  Every accomplishment, great or small,  starts  with  enthusiasm.  Nothing
  great was ever done without it.

The road to providing education for liberation is not as near  as  some  may
be tempted to think. The struggle for liberating education is  going  to  be
with us for quite some time. The quest  for  equal,  quality  and  equitable
education provision is going to be  our  preoccupation  for  some  years  to
come. What was wrong for decades cannot be corrected within a year  or  two.
I do not want to sound like a pessimist in this regard, but I  want  to  say
that the hon the Minister is trying by all means to transform  education  in
this country, and I believe that it is also our responsibility to  help  the
Minister in ensuring that education is transformed in our country.

The Education Laws Amendment Bill is one  bill  that  tries  to  ascend  the
steep hill of redressing  the  imbalances  of  the  past.  It  is  for  this
particular broad reason that we in KwaZulu-Natal have  supported  the  Bill,
because it tries by all means to transform our education.

The first thing that we applaud is the attempt of the Minister to lower  the
entry age for our learners, as stipulated in section 5 of Act  84  of  1996.
In most quarters of our country this was hailed as a positive  move  by  the
department. I also know that in the country as a whole it was  hailed  as  a
wise move. There is ample research that proves beyond any  shadow  of  doubt
that  children  are  ready  for  school  at  an  early  age.   International
experience  also  proves  that   children   can   analyse,   integrate   and
differentiate as early as the age of four.

I know for a fact that there could be arguments against this, but the  whole
question of the milieu in which children grow up  also  plays  a  role.  The
home background, the environmental background, the  school  conditions,  the
peer group and the economic status of the family can  all  be  factors  that
people could bring to the fore. But I want to say that we hail this move  by
the hon the Minister.

Another issue that  we  also  applaud  is  the  provision  of  the  National
Curriculum Statement. We  know  that  the  Minister,  through  the  National
Curriculum Statement, is  trying  to  produce  a  lifelong  learner  who  is
confident   and   independent,   literate,   numerate   and    multiskilled,
compassionate, and has respect and the ability to participate in  a  society
as a critical and active citizen. I know that there  are  arguments  against
all this, but to me this is a wise move.

Members will recall that at the time of negotiating  a  mandate,  we  sought
clarity on a number of clauses, but we found satisfactory answers. We are  a
nation in a learning curve and there is a lot that we still  have  to  learn
along the way. Whilst the whole question of  uniform  standards  on  learner
assessment is mentioned as the prerogative  of  the  Minister,  some  people
doubted whether we needed a national curriculum. But in order  to  create  a
framework, and procedures and standards, there is a need  for  a  curriculum
statement.

Clause 4 provides for the accompaniment of a learner by an  intermediary,  a
parent or anyone designated by a parent. This is a praiseworthy exercise.

The prohibition of initiation practices in clause 5 is also a welcome trend-
setting mechanism  by  the  hon  the  Minister.  Learners  feel  denigrated,
undermined and dehumanised when initiation practices are conducted.

The same can be said of corporal punishment, which  lowers  the  dignity  of
the individual. We in KwaZulu-Natal feel that the Minister has undertaken  a
wise move by amending the legislation  in  respect  of  the  abolishment  of
corporal punishment.

With regard to clause 10 it was  felt,  specially  during  public  hearings,
that the Minister had done a good  thing  by  intervening  in  some  of  the
functions of school governing bodies,  because  there  are  complaints  that
school  governings  bodies  are  sometimes  nepotistic   in   dealing   with
education. There is also a need to empower school governing bodies,  because
some of them cannot differentiate between management  and  governance.  They
fail to see that they are there to govern and not to manage  education.  So,
there is a need for training in respect of these institutions so  that  they
can play a more meaningful role.

Finally, the registration of further training institutions is a move in  the
right direction, because we have a lot  of  fly-by-night  schools.  Some  of
them are causing problems, offering education that is not  accredited,  even
doctorates for that matter. So we feel that the Minister  has  done  a  good
thing by coming with the clause on the abolishment  of  those  schools  that
are not registered. [Applause.]

Adv A H GAUM (Western Cape): Chairperson, from  the  outset  this  Education
Laws Amendment  Bill  has  been  characterised  by  a  number  of  differing
opinions, which has resulted in a number of proposals and  counterproposals.
In terms of  the  initial  proposals  presented  by  the  Minister  and  his
department, reservations about three  of  the  clauses  being  amended  were
expressed,  namely  those  regarding  the  appointment  of  educators,   the
lowering of the admission age and the powers of  the  national  Minister  to
make regulations on a wide range of matters, including the curriculum.

At this juncture it is important to point out that as a  province  we  agree
with the objectives of the Bill as far as appointments of new educators  and
those who had a break in their  service  are  concerned.  According  to  the
explanatory memorandum to the Bill, the reason for the measures proposed  is
to make it easier for provinces  to  place  new  recruits  to  the  teaching
profession, especially in rural areas, or those returning to the  profession
after a break in service.

The aim of this  process  is  to  ensure  the  fair  distribution  of  well-
qualified educators and assist in the placement of students  who  have  been
awarded bursaries or loans by either their employer or the state  to  study.
We wholeheartedly support these aims. We do not, therefore, have  a  problem
with the intent of the  Bill,  but  do  not  all  agree  on  the  method  of
achieving these objectives.

Die   aanvanklike   weergawe   van   die   wetsontwerp    wat    provinsiale
onderwysdepartemente toelaat om sekere opvoeders direk aan  te  stel,  druis
in teen die gees van die Suid-Afrikaanse Skolewet deurdat dit 'n  beduidende
inperking van die betrokkenheid van beheerliggame  by  die  aanstelling  van
opvoeders in skole verteenwoordig het.

Ek en my departement het, as 'n kompromis, die volgende prosedure  aanbeveel
wat  die  magte  van  beheerliggame  sou  beskerm:  posvlak   1-poste   word
geadverteer; die beheerliggaam  beveel  die  suksesvolle  kandidaat  by  die
departement vir aanstelling aan; die departement maak  'n  lys  van  al  die
onsuksesvolle kandidate wat eerste aanstellings is, en van  dié  wat  ná  'n
diensonderbreking wil terugkeer en wat gewillig is om geplaas te  word  waar
hulle benodig word; die departement voorsien die lys aan skole  wat  nie  in
staat was om hulle vakatures te vul nie; en ná  oorleg  met  die  onderskeie
beheerliggame, sal die werkgewer hierdie opvoeders dienooreenkomstig  plaas.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The original version of the Bill, which allows  provincial  departments  of
education to directly appoint certain educators, goes against the spirit  of
the  South  African  Schools  Act  in  that  it  represented  a  significant
limitation of the involvement of governing bodies with  the  appointment  of
educators at schools.

My department and I, as a compromise, recommended  the  following  procedure
which would protect the powers of governing bodies: post level-1  posts  are
advertised; the governing body recommends the successful candidates  to  the
department  for  appointment;  the  department  makes  a  list  of  all  the
unsuccessful candidates who are first appointments and of those who want  to
come back after a break in service and who are willing to  be  placed  where
they are needed; the department provides the list to schools  who  were  not
in a position to fill their  vacancies;  and  after  consultation  with  the
different  governing  bodies,  the  employer  will  place  these   educators
accordingly.]

Following this proposal,  and  extensive  discussions  at  the  Council  for
Education Ministers, I had the impression - and  I  know  that  there  is  a
difference of opinion on this matter between me and Minister  Asmal  -  that
it was agreed to amend the Bill to involve governing bodies in  consultation
on three aspects, namely the  post  to  be  filled  in  this  new  way,  the
requirements of the post, and also the eventual appointment.

I was therefore surprised that the version of the Education  Laws  Amendment
Bill which was placed before Parliament's Portfolio Committee  on  Education
only made provision for the requirements of the post to  be  discussed  with
the governing body. It was therefore with regret that I had to  withdraw  my
personal support for the whole scheme.

Although I am an advocate of greater integration of teaching  staff  in  our
schools and support the idea of proper utilisation of qualified teachers,  I
believe  that  governing  body  involvement  in  this  process   should   be
protected, given the high expectations we have of these important bodies.
The Minister referred to the cumbersome appointment process of educators.  I
would like to tell the Minister that one of our  greatest  problems  is  the
number of disputes being declared. There should be a  mechanism  to  dismiss
disputes without delay where there is clearly no prima  facie  case.  And  I
would really want us to discuss that at one point or another at the  Council
of Education Ministers.

Voorts is daar ook die siening dat die mag wat in die  aanvanklike  weergawe
van die wetsontwerp aan die nasionale Minister gegee  is  om  regulasies  te
maak, sy konstitusionele  mandaat  om  norme,  standaarde  en  raamwerke  te
verskaf, te bowe gegaan het. Dit was nou in die  aanvanklike  weergawe.  Wat
die aanvanklike weergawe van klousule 61 van  die  wetsontwerp  betref,  sou
dit die  nasionale  Minister  byvoorbeeld  toegelaat  het  om  'n  nasionale
kurrikulum in die fynste detail voor te skryf. Daarenteen  glo  ek  dat  die
bedoeling was om artikel 146(2) van die Grondwet te  beperk  tot  sake  soos
norme  en  standaarde,  die  raamwerk   en   beleid   met   betrekking   tot
kurrikulumsake. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[There is also furthermore the view that the power, which was given  to  the
national Minister in the original version of the Bill to  make  regulations,
has exceeded his constitutional mandate  to  provide  norms,  standards  and
frameworks. That was in the original version. Clause  61,  in  the  original
version of the Bill, would have allowed the national Minister, for  example,
to prescribe a national curriculum in the finest detail. On the contrary,  I
believe that the intention was to limit section 146(2) of  the  Constitution
to matters such as norms  and  standards,  the  framework  and  policy  with
regard to curriculum matters.]

However, the latest version of the Bill - the one  before  us  today  -  now
takes cognisance of this  viewpoint  and  limits  the  Minister's  power  to
prescribe a national curriculum statement,  not  a  national  curriculum  as
such, but a statement. This is in keeping with the Constitution and we  want
to tell the Minister that we truly appreciate this amendment.

Clauses 3 and 9  of  the  Bill  provide  the  Minister  with  the  power  to
determine matters regarding curriculum and assessment. Currently we  have  a
four-point scale of assessment in the  GET  phase.  A  five-point  scale  is
proposed for the FET phase.

Replacing percentages with these scales does not allow for a distinction  to
be  made  between  below-average,  average,  above-average   and   excellent
achievement. This is problematic and I would hope that  the  Minister  would
review this, given his new power in terms of the Bill.

Die wetsontwerp bepaal ook die toelatingsouderdom vir graad 0 as vyf en  vir
graad 1 as  ses.  My  departement  beraam  dat  dit  die  leerderinname  met
ongeveer 30 000 in ons provinsie sal laat toeneem, teen  'n  koste  van  R81
miljoen. Alhoewel daar niks fout met die beginsel is  nie,  is  die  gevolge
van  hierdie  klousule  potensieel  problematies,  tensy  fondse   ingevolge
artikel 35 van die wet op die  bestuur  van  openbare  finansies  beskikbaar
gestel word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The Bill also determines the admission age for Grade  0  as  five  and  for
Grade 1 as six.  My  department  estimates  that  this  would  increase  the
learner intake with approximately 30 000 in our province, at a cost  of  R81
million.  Although  there  is  nothing  wrong  with   the   principle,   the
consequences of this clause is  potentially  problematic,  unless  funds  in
terms of section 35 of the Act on the  management  of  public  finances  are
made available.]

I would like to plead with the Minister that the immense  pressure  that  is
being placed on provinces due to unfunded mandates like  these  and  due  to
national decisions with a lot of merit, but  according  to  which  provinces
are expected to implement decisions at a  very  late  stage  of  the  school
year, be minimised as far as is humanly possible.

One of the most positive aspects of the  Bill,  and  one  that  is  strongly
supported by everyone, is clause 12,  allowing  the  Minister  to  prescribe
performance  standards  for  teachers  according  to  which  they   can   be
evaluated.  I  have  personally  also  pushed  this  matter  at  consecutive
meetings of the CEM. There must be rewards  for  excellent  work,  but  also
consequences for continued failure.

As in any other profession, teachers must be  evaluated  and  provided  with
the opportunity to improve their performance.  We  believe  that  this  will
result in a more effective and skilled group of educators. This  is  a  very
welcome and positive part of this Bill,  and  I  would  like  to  thank  the
Minister for this.

In order to maintain a balanced perspective of the Bill, it must  be  viewed
in its totality. The intentions of the Bill are noble, but all of us  cannot
agree with the  methods  proposed  to  achieve  some  of  these  objectives.
However, there are also very positive aspects of the Bill  that  all  of  us
can support wholeheartedly and that will bring about significant  change  in
our education system. For example, we would like to thank the Minister  very
much for the provision regarding performance standards.
Viewed in its totality, and taking into account all views, the Western  Cape
has decided to abstain from voting on the Bill.

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, hon Minister, hon  special  delegates,  hon  colleagues,
the Education Laws Amendment Bill seeks to amend various education  Acts  to
enable the Minister of Education to regulate, inter alia, policy  areas  for
public and independent schools, for example the admission age of a learner.

During the first year of the implementation of  the  South  African  Schools
Act, Act No 84 of 1996, two categories  of  children  will  be  admitted  to
Grades R and 1 respectively as follows: in Grade 1, those who are  five  and
turning six and those who are four and turning five by 30 June in each  year
of admission; in Grade 1, those who are six and turning seven and those  who
are five and turning six by 30 June in the year of admission.

The effective lowering of the age of admission by six  months  brings  South
Africa in line with international practice. But is the broad  South  African
community ready for the implementation of this  new,  certainly  progressive
step? Are Grade R facilities readily available?  Do  all  our  multicultural
communities have equal access to quality preprimary  facilities?  These  are
some of our concerns, but this amendment is supported by my party.

One national process for assessment  of  learner  achievement  implies  that
there will be one common national process for  learner  achievement  in  the
Republic, as opposed to provincial processes.  This  is  in  line  with  the
injunction of the Cabinet decision of 20 June 2001 to establish  a  national
curriculum and a system of learner assessment.

The appointment of an intermediary at  disciplinary  hearings  to  assist  a
minor learner in giving evidence is a welcome step.  No  child  should  feel
intimidated or be made  vulnerable  when  giving  evidence  at  disciplinary
hearings. This amendment would certainly increase  the  rate  of  successful
prosecutions.
The prohibition of initiation practices is highly welcome. The Human  Rights
Commission had recommended that regulations be promulgated  to  ensure  that
initiation practices be abolished by means of regulations.  Most  initiation
practices are humiliating, degrading and sometimes injurious to the  victim,
in flagrant disregard and disrespect of constitutional imperatives.  The  DP
regards human rights and the dignity  of  our  children  as  non-negotiable.
Corporal punishment and  initiation  practices  are  not  only  abusive  and
primitive, but unconstitutional.

What my party feels uncomfortable about is the  proposed  amendment  to  the
Employment of Educators Act of 1998. Removing the  right  of  selection  and
recommendation from school governing bodies is definitely  problematic.  The
concept of school governing bodies was a new  principle  that  propounded  a
novel partnership  between  a  community  and  a  provincial  department  of
education. For too long our education has been remote-controlled,  from  the
community's point of  view.  Indeed,  the  education  of  yesterday  can  be
described as a tug of war, with  departments  of  education  and  the  local
communities at opposite ends.

But the inception of the role of school governing bodies established  a  new
covenant between state departments  of  education  and  school  communities.
Parents took ownership of schools,  recommending  and  appointing  educators
who would be responsible to teach their children. But  really,  we  see  the
attempt by the Minister to ``rule by regulation'' as an erosion  of  one  of
the most important rights of school governing bodies. This  is  seen  by  my
party as another manifestation of the ANC's propensity  towards  centralism;
to govern by decree. This is no different from the previous  regime's  modus
operandi which, as the hon Minister himself aptly described in  his  opening
remarks,  was  a   ``highly   authoritative   and   prescribed   manner   of
governance''.

The DP sees the circumscribing of the powers of school governing  bodies  in
appointing teachers as a potential minefield  of  long,  drawn-out  disputes
between teacher unions, governing bodies and state departments.

But, in conclusion let me hasten to welcome the hon Minister's  decision  to
conduct a comprehensive review of how  SGBs  are  functioning.  There  is  a
ground swell of dissatisfaction at the  high-handed  manner  in  which  some
SGBs are misusing their authority. Anecdotes are plentiful.  They  certainly
would make  for  despairing  reading.  But  the  fact  remains  that  as  an
instrument to get parents and communities  involved  in  who  teaches  their
children,  the  misdemeanours  of  some  SGBs  should  not  be   enough   to
circumscribe the potential for the good of our schools.

The DP therefore cannot help but oppose the Bill.

Ms B D CREECY (Gauteng): Chairperson, hon Minister and  colleagues,  Gauteng
welcomes and supports the Education Laws  Amendment  Bill.  We  held  public
hearings in our province on this Bill and I am happy to say that there  were
many teacher unions, governing bodies  and  stakeholders  in  education  who
actually came forward to support the Bill.

There were those who were opposed to it, and I will deal with some of  those
issues shortly. But one of the  most  refreshing  things  about  our  public
hearings  was  that  there  were,  in  certain  instances,  principals  from
northern suburbs high schools in Johannesburg who  were  prepared  to  break
out of the kind of paranoic laager that my colleague from the  DP  likes  to
take shelter in, and actually to say that they believed that the  deployment
of educators and the deracialisation of the teaching component would  assist
the situation.

Let me start with the issue of the minimum  curriculum  statement.  I  think
one thing we have to reiterate is that we  are  not  talking  here  about  a
national curriculum. [Interjections.]

Listen,  you  might  learn  something!  This  is   the   education   debate.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mahlangu): Order!

Ms B D CREECY (Gauteng): We are not talking about the  national  curriculum;
we are talking about the minimum curriculum  statement  that  will  set  out
basic outcomes for the education system. Why do we need this? We  come  from
a deeply divided past. We are still living in a deeply divided  country  and
the state has a role to play in nation-building, and in  ensuring  that  all
children, whether they go to state  schools  or  independent  schools,  have
basic knowledge and skills that will equip them to enter the job  market  in
the future.

At our public hearings we heard of  the  concerns  of  people,  particularly
from the religious sector, that this was going to undermine  the  rights  of
parents to influence religious education in schools. I  think  our  province
wants to reject  that  categorically.  We  are  not  saying  to  independent
schools that they would not be allowed to do such things. However,  what  we
are saying is that we cannot have a situation  where  children  emerge  from
several years of schooling and do not know more than  one  language  in  our
multilinguistic country, and do not know maths and science. That is a  human
right and as Government I think we have a right to protect that.

The other issue - I think this was referred to by the hon the Minister -  is
that, even in my own constituency, which is the inner city of  Johannesburg,
we still  have  fly-by-night  schools,  schools  that  pose  as  educational
institutions but in fact offer very little in the  way  of  hard  curriculum
outcome. Many of the parents who send their children there are poor  parents
and need protection from those types of institutions.

I also think it is important that we  should  clarify  the  fact  that  this
particular  amendment  in  no  way  undermines  the  right  of   bona   fide
examination bodies that are set up in  terms  of  the  General  and  Further
Education and Training Quality Assurance Act. The South African Schools  Act
does not determine the right of these bodies to exist,  and  therefore  this
amendment cannot take away those rights. I think that it is  important  that
we understand that, and do not mislead the public  in  the  course  of  this
debate.

The second thing that our province supports categorically is  the  right  of
the Department of Education to deploy teachers. The reason that  we  support
it is that we think this is a fundamental provision that will  allow  us  to
protect that standard and quality of education in our country. The  hon  the
Minister has spoken about the lengthy and cumbersome processes that  pertain
to teacher deployment. In our public hearings we heard evidence that in  the
greater Johannesburg alone there are 900 unemployed educators,  and  yet  we
still have classrooms in our province where we do not have teachers.

There has  been  a  lot  of  talk  about  incentivisation,  and  we  support
incentivisation. The Gauteng department of education is spending R20  000  a
year of taxpayers' money on providing bursaries for  teachers  who  want  to
study maths, science and technology. That is incentivisation.  But  some  of
those teachers cannot  get  jobs.  They  cannot  get  jobs  because  in  all
communities in our country there is prejudice against ``outsiders''.

If we want to give the taxpayer value for money, if we want to  protect  the
rights of learners to learn, then we have to be prepared, as Government,  to
make an intervention in a situation where the market has clearly  failed  to
deploy educators adequately.

I think we also felt that Government has a duty to deracialise  the  teacher
component in our schools. Many schools in this country now have a  situation
where  the  learner  component  has   been   deracialised.   That   pertains
particularly, in many instances, to the former Model C  schools.  We  cannot
have a situation  in  our  schools  where  the  only  African  person  those
children ever see is employed as a  gardener  or  a  cleaner.  That  is  not
building our nonracialism; that is not teaching our children  to  understand
that we live in a society where all people, of all racial groups,  can  hold
positions  of  authority  and  can  influence  the  direction  of  children.
[Applause.]
In conclusion, I want  to  deal  with  the  issue  of  decentralisation  and
devolution. The hon the Minister talked about the commitment of the  ANC  to
ensuring  that  parents,  communities  and  learners  work  together  in   a
partnership with teachers and principals. We remain committed to that.  That
is the cornerstone of our approach to governance. But to  pretend  that  one
can fanatically adhere to decentralisation and devolution for its own  sake,
no matter what the  conditions  that  pertain  in  a  particular  school  or
situation, is nothing more than a cynical commitment  to  making  sure  that
schools in historically disadvantaged areas remain disadvantaged,  and  that
schools in historically privileged areas  remain  privileged.  That  is  not
something that we can allow. We cannot allow a situation where, in the  name
of decentralisation and  devolution,  we  say  that  those  schools  in  the
townships and the rural areas must pull themselves up by  their  own  broken
bootstraps, because it is not going to happen.

I know that in my own province we  will  welcome  the  Minister's  statement
today, that he intends to review the functioning  of  governing  bodies.  In
our own annual report we have actually asked the Department of Education  to
review the capacity-building processes that it has put in place  for  school
governing bodies. We are of the opinion that unless we provide those  bodies
with greater capacity, greater guidance and greater support, they are  going
to remain very hollow bodies. [Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, I will  start  with  Mr  Raju.  I  think  we  will
transform this country, with or without the support of the DP. We  will,  of
course, drag them along, kicking and screaming,  because  they  are  a  tiny
minority. They will not stop us. Of course, we would  also  like  to  remind
hon member Raju that this is a section 76 Bill and parties  can  only  howl.
We take provinces into consideration when it comes to section 76 Bills.  So,
it is just howling.

Chairperson, hon members and provincial  delegates,  South  African  society
has undergone major social, economic and political  changes  over  the  past
few years as we have sought to establish a democratic, united and  nonsexist
society. There is no doubt  that  our  ANC-led  Government  has  taken  huge
strides in its endeavour to transform education, to ensure that our  victory
translates into improvement mainly in the previously disadvantaged  schools,
both rural and urban.

The Education Laws Amendment Bill tabled here today seeks to  galvanise  the
victories, whilst at the same time giving further impetus  to  schooling  on
an equitable and nonracial basis. Moreover, it seeks to amend those  aspects
of our legislation  that  do  not  support  these  objectives,  through  the
amending of the five pieces of legislation as  supported  by  all  provinces
but one. We do not care about parties.  These  amendments  are  intended  to
ensure that the  hon  the  Minister  can  make  policies  that  are  legally
binding.

Other amendments,  such  as  the  amendments  to  the  General  and  Further
Education and Training Quality Assurance Act, are essentially technical  and
minor in nature.
To avoid further litigation, as in the Harris case, the department  has  had
to reduce the age of admission by six months  in  both  public  and  private
schools with effect from 2004. This, of course,  as  indicated  earlier  on,
has many advantages. This  will  also  facilitate  the  smooth  movement  of
learners from one school type to another.

The Bill provides for a National Curriculum  Statement  applicable  to  both
public and independent schools. This is an important  instrument,  since  it
affords us the opportunity to benchmark our curriculum  and  ensure  similar
approaches   and   outcomes.   Moreover,   it   places   a    constitutional
responsibility on private schools to provide education that is of  equal  or
even better standards than what is provided in public schools. As a  country
we cannot have different  standards  in  different  provinces.  We  are  one
country with different cultures, one nation in the  making,  and  we  should
have the same standards.

Discipline  in  an  organisation  is  the  bedrock  of  success.  It  is   a
prerequisite for stability and progress in our school  environment.  Schools
with good intentions have dragged learners to disciplinary hearings  without
the knowledge of their parents. The amendment to section 8  prescribes  that
a learner must be accompanied by his or her parents or a  person  designated
by the parents to such hearings. This is to be welcomed and  it  will  go  a
long way towards reducing the number of disciplinary hearings, because  many
learners would not want their parents to know that they  are  naughty.  This
section also makes provision for  the  appointment  of  an  intermediary  at
disciplinary hearings in schools  where  a  minor  is  involved.  This  will
prevent  intimidation  and  the  psychological  torture  of  minors  in  our
schools.

The provision that mandates the MEC for Education to determine the  code  of
conduct for governing bodies is one of the most  important  aspects  of  the
Bill. There exists no provision  to  ensure  proper  conduct  by  individual
members of governing bodies. More often than  not,  the  members  of  school
governing bodies fail to comply with their  responsibilities.  Such  failure
could result in members either being suspended  or  dismissed,  but  in  the
same breath we want to join other speakers in this debate  in  calling  upon
the department to introduce training programmes for these  school  governing
bodies as a matter of urgency.

There are many people in society who left school  because  of  the  barbaric
and backward nature of initiation practices in  schools.  In  this  way  our
country lost potential intellectuals who would have  contributed  positively
to the development of our country. We  unreservedly  agree  with  the  Human
Rights Commission that this practice dehumanises learners.  We  congratulate
the department for proposing that this be outlawed  once  and  for  all.  We
hasten to say that those practices which are to be outlawed have nothing  in
common with positive orientation,  as  long  as  it  does  not  directly  or
indirectly negatively harm learners physically, mentally or emotionally.

It is generally accepted that  teachers  are  doing  an  invaluable  job  in
moulding learners into adults who are able to  contribute  to  building  our
country. It is important for teachers, therefore, to be evaluated from  time
to time, with the aim of helping  them  realise  their  noble  task.  It  is
desirable that  the  performance  standards  according  to  which  they  are
evaluated  are  standards  agreed  upon  by  all   the   affected   parties.
Unfortunately, that agreement is not  forthcoming.  The  hon  the  Minister,
therefore, is left  with  no  option  but  to  prescribe  those  performance
standards. This is done with the understanding that if  at  any  given  time
there is an agreement, that agreement will be observed and upheld.

We must hasten to say that the type of evaluation we are talking about  here
has nothing in common with the  type  of  evaluation  we  experienced  under
apartheid. That type of evaluation was meant to find  fault  and  to  punish
people, and was destructive rather than constructive.  We  are  saying  that
the evaluation we are talking about here is  meant  to  be  progressive  and
help the teachers.

I was a teacher myself and I remember that during those times  an  inspector
of schools would leave his car some 500  metres  away  from  the  school  or
somewhere behind a bush so that he would not be detected  when  he  came  to
the school. Sometimes one would just  see  an  inspector  peeping  into  the
classroom one was teaching. It was humiliating. The type  of  evaluation  we
are talking about here has nothing to do with that experience that  some  of
us had.

The necessity for the amendment of the Educators' Employment  Act  is  still
generating howls and jeers from  the  galleries  where  the  privileged  are
seated, simply  because  they  do  not  take  kindly  to  the  reality  that
appointments at the majority of schools still take place on racial,  ethnic,
language and even gender grounds. In terms of these  provisions,  first-time
applications of teachers and those who might have  broken  service  will  be
done by the Department of Education and not the school governing bodies.  We
are saying this is not taking  away  the  powers  of  the  school  governing
bodies, but will enhance proper education in our schools.

It must also be noted that no employer will offer one a  job  and  then  ask
one where one would like to work. Appointments are  made  against  vacancies
which, in terms of the legislation, may now be  offered  to  new  graduates.
This will simplify the process for schools, which will not have to wait  for
the Gazette, advertising and interviews.

We also want to remind those members in the opposition benches that this  is
not intended to erode the powers of the school  governing  bodies.  It  will
promote a fairer distribution of  teachers  and  skills  between  rural  and
urban schools, and will also go a long way in deracialising our schools.  As
it is, especially in the former model C  schools  in  urban  areas,  as  the
Minister has indicated, one will find that 90% of  the  students  are  black
but 100% of the teachers are white. We think that this  is  an  anomaly  and
with this provision we will be able to correct this type of situation.

In conclusion, the Education Laws Amendment Bill is the culmination  of  our
Government's continuous efforts to steer this general and further  education
band to a new reality, free from the shackles of  the  apartheid  past,  and
one that is more responsive to the needs of this country.

The ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Chairperson, sorry, do you know, I  am  not
used to your furniture yet.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: There is a trick to it. You just push  it  back
a little bit and then you move away. That is right! [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: A very famous economist John Maynard Keynes  once
said: ``When the facts change, I change my mind''. So when the facts on  the
ground change one needs to react without  being  opportunistic  and  without
giving up fundamental principles.  When  the  actual  facts  on  the  ground
change and they stare at us, all of those who are  blind  to  the  need  for
change refuse to react. This is a  very  serious  indictment,  both  of  our
intelligence and our position in a multicultural and multireligious  society
that is trying to forge some kind of national identity. That  is  why  I  am
saddened by two or three interventions.

I would like to have in fact referred to the  very  helpful  recommendations
made by people who do not come from my party, but time does not allow it.  I
do not think that Mr Sogoni or Prof Khubisa come from my party, but I  would
have liked to refer to some of the very important proposals and  suggestions
they made. However, since this is an actual debate, I must respond  to  some
of the points made. I regret to say then to my two brothers  and  to  others
who made extraordinary contributions here that I would not be able to  refer
to them, because for the record we  are  going  to  clear  up  some  of  the
things.

Because the record is not only found in Hansard, but also in the  minds  and
imagination of our people, let me start off with the first general issue.  I
sat next to the previous Minister of Education for  five  years.  The  South
African Schools Act, the National Education Policy Act,  the  amendments  to
the  legislation,  last  year's  amendments  to  the  legislation  and  this
legislation was opposed  by  the  DP.  No  social  legislation  attached  to
education, which is of a fundamental nature,  not  of  marginal  importance,
has ever been supported by the  DP.  It  is  an  indictment  of  change  and
development, particularly since they now claim to be the custodians  of  the
school governing bodies, which are in the South African Schools Act.

We, in the ANC, and particularly Comrade Blade  Nzimande  were  instrumental
in working out the position of school governing bodies and their powers.  We
initiated them as we initiated the Constitutional Court as a protection.  We
initiated the list system, the proportional representation, as a  protection
for minorities. We initiated  the  proposals  about  the  Public  Protector.
[Interjections.] We initiated the constitutional provisions relating to  all
the commissions of the youth and the needy.  [Interjections.]  We  initiated
them as part of the democratic unfolding.

AN HON MEMBER: That is true!
The MINISTER: However, every five or six years we have to  review  how  they
are working.

AN HON MEMBER: Absolutely!

The MINISTER: That is why I  reviewed  outcome-based  education,  which  has
never been supported by the DP. I regret to say that we have a  co-operative
agreement with the New NP. However, the New NP is in the same  boat  as  the
DP; they have never supported a piece of progressive legislation.

Adv A H GAUM: No, that is not true!

The MINISTER: No, they have not! [Interjections.] I am sorry; it is the  hon
member's imagination. Adv Gaum is economical with the truth and I will  come
to that in a moment.  [Interjections.]  He  is  being  economical  with  the
truth!

Adv A H GAUM: That is not even worth an argument!

The MINISTER: Well, the hon member is too young to  remember  what  happened
five  or  six  years  ago,  because  progressive   legislation   is   social
legislation.

Adv A H GAUM: [Inaudible.] ... on behalf of Ireland! [Interjections.]

The MINISTER: No, no, the hon member is guilty of being a  yahoo.  He  is  a
yahoo man! He knows nothing, he never learnt anything and he  has  forgotten
everything again. [Interjections.]

Let me deal specifically with this. First of all, let me  say  to  Mr  Adams
that Judge Bertelsmann never said that the best interests of the  child  are
only in fact  protected  by  the  school  governing  body.  He  levelled  no
criticism against  the  province  in  that  particular  area.  What  he  was
concerned with was the procedures that took place. Therefore the hon  member
cannot generalise. In any case, we are putting beyond  doubt  the  procedure
for first-time appointments and, of course, those who come back.

As far as Mr Adams' corporal punishment is concerned, I do not think he  can
be a sneaking regarder who says that he supports the law, but in  fact  what
happens in reality?  We  did  not  make  corporal  punishment  illegal.  The
Constitutional Court said that it is cruel and unusual punishment.  However,
let me say now that I have been in touch with the SA Council  of  Educators.
To inflict corporal punishment is illegal, it is assault and battery and  it
is violence against a person.

Let me be quite clear then, because in the light of what I  have  been  told
by KwaZulu-Natal this is observed uniformly. Teachers who  inflict  corporal
punishment, with or without provocation, would be struck  off  the  role  of
the SA Council of Educators, apart from the fact that the parents could  sue
them and bring a civil case for violence against children.

We have proposed  alternatives  to  corporal  punishment.  We  belong  to  a
national ministry and it is the job of  the  provinces  to  implement  these
alternatives. We have proposed in a  publication  that  meetings  should  be
held in the teacher's  centres.  We  have  proposed  them.  [Interjections.]
[Laughter.]  These  proposals  are  on   record   in   the   library   here!
[Interjections.] I want to say that the anecdotal stories of  Mr  Adams  are
irrelevant.

The leader of the New NP in the National Assembly said that he  was  beaten,
hit and assaulted and that everyone could see that there was  nothing  wrong
with him. My reply to that was might he not have been a  better  man  if  he
had not been assaulted and brutalised in school. [Interjections.] That is  a
fact! The plain fact of the matter is that it is now  illegal  and  we  must
observe the law. I must not nod at the law. In the same way ...

AN HON MEMBER: What about discipline?

The MINISTER: Regarding discipline, we have proposed alternatives.  The  hon
member does not listen.

AN HON MEMBER: So why is he talking? [Interjections.]

The MINISTER: First of all, I do not think we have a major  problem  if  one
looks at it carefully, unless one is saying nothing  good  is  happening  in
South Africa. As a Minister, who is a critical person by nature,  I  do  not
believe that we have a fundamental problem of discipline  in  South  African
schools if one goes around to the schools. Read what is  happening,  not  in
the inner cities,  but  in  private  schools  in  countries  that  I  cannot
mention, because I am a Minister and I do not want the ambassadors and  High
Commissioners to be writing to me.

Look at what is happening on the ground. In the United States  schools,  not
in the inner school centres, are armed garrisons,  really  armed  garrisons.
This is because of the serial killings that are taking place. In the  United
Kingdom, in the very posh private girls schools, there is no  discipline  of
any kind. We are much  better  at  this.  Mr  Adams  talked  about  respect.
Respect must be earned. It cannot be laid down. It must be really earned  by
all authorities, by all of us. Because of a Minister  there  cannot  be  any
difference to that.
One has to respect and earn that respect. That is why we say in  the  policy
alternatives that one cannot earn respect by beating. What happens  is  that
learners will become withdrawn. That is why I say that it is very  important
to recognise that this must be a process of growing  up  together.  In  this
area we are not in fact the most violent and most difficult country  in  the
world. I cannot go into Mr Sogoni's very progressive proposal about that.  I
agree with him and I agree with Ms Creecy. In fact, I am going to  find  out
through this review how much provinces have done,  how  much  allocation  of
resources for the training of school governing bodies have taken place.

Let us not be sentimental about school governing  bodies.  Where  they  have
worked there have been parent teacher association  bodies.  There  are  many
cases where I have been to schools where they still  have,  in  tandem,  the
school  governing  body  and  the  parent  teacher  association.  The   real
decisions are taken in the  parent  teacher  association.  That  is  totally
wrong, because one has 80% Africans in a  school,  but  20%  on  the  school
governing body.
The parent teacher association has lasted 25 to 30 years and they  take  the
real decisions. So I  want  to  investigate  this.  Is  it  true  or  is  it
anecdotal, because it firstly represents a particular privilege.  They  take
the real decisions and the school governing body is a reporting body.  So  I
am going to look at  this,  Mr  Sogoni,  and  look  very  carefully  at  the
training. Next year the third cycle starts and let  us  now  investigate  in
the provinces how much actual training is provided. In the same way I  agree
with Prof Khubisa, like Emerson, that everything starts with enthusiasm.  We
must not put the dull  hand  of  alienation  and  doubt.  Teachers  must  be
fortified and enthusiasm is vital for their teaching. I agree with him  very
much.

Let me turn to the  age  at  which  children  are  school-ready.  There  are
differences of opinion and the law allows it. There are people  who  rightly
say - I am a grandfather so I have some interest in this - that children  up
to a certain age of six or seven need a home life of cherishing,  homeliness
and the kind of things that happen there. I went to school when I  was  nine
years old for various reasons, but I  finished  school,  on  the  cycle,  by
eighteen. I remember the extraordinary  advantage  of  growing  up  with  my
father. Not all of us can do that, but there are different views  about  it.
We are leaving it to parents to decide which is the right age.

I want to say to Adv Gaum that there is  a  difference  in  recollection.  I
said that he was economical with the truth, because I  wrote  to  him  about
the issues that he raised and I did not receive a contradictory response  to
that. [Interjections.] I did not receive that, because my minutes  say  that
at the beginning we proposed that there must be  an  agreement  between  the
province and the school governing body. Everybody said that  this  would  be
cumbersome and impossible to operate. There would be  disputes  left,  right
and centre, and that is why we amended it. The recollection he  has  is  not
born out by the facts,  and  I  am  prepared  in  fact  to  enter  into  the
discussion. Secondly, it is not true that we have unfunded mandates.

The Grade R operation, which  is  vital  to  carry  out  the  constitutional
provisions for compulsory education of 10 years,  would  only  become  fully
operative in 2004 at my request. I do not mind Mr Gaum  claiming  victories.
I do not mind that at all, although they may  not  be  entirely  in  keeping
with the facts as to what may have happened. [Interjections.] The  important
thing is that we proposed changes,  because  we  work  collectively  in  our
department and therefore I must pay tribute to my officials. There is no  il
duce, una voce, one dictator, one voice, in the department.

We work collectively, and sometimes they do not show enough respect for  the
Minister by contradicting him all the time. However,  we  work  collectively
and the changes that we bring about are necessitated by  the  needs  of  our
society. As the hon member can see, our department is  made  up  of  a  wide
mosaic of the traditions of South  Africa.  However,  the  hon  member  must
remember that there are Xhosa  teachers  who  do  not  have  Xhosa  as  home
language. We have Xhosa speakers and speakers of other indigenous  languages
who do not speak like the children do.

There are appointments that are continuing to be made where fully  qualified
people, who happen to be black, are not given the posts and this  cannot  be
accepted. Always think of John Maynard Keynes, when the facts change I  must
react to the changes. We see that  we  do  not  have  much  time  left.  The
extraordinary tolerance of our African brothers and sisters  is  remarkable.
We do not have enough time. There must come a time, for  example,  that  the
whole issue of the language  of  instruction  in  schools  become  an  issue
again, because five or six years later  we  must  look  at  it,  although  I
subscribe very strongly and trenchantly to  the  whole  question  of  mother
tongue instruction.

Grade R will start in 2004 and there are two years to plan.  What  Adv  Gaum
should be looking at is that expenditure on education in  the  Western  Cape
declined under the administration of his predecessor. Money was  transferred
to building roads. Mr Manuel, the Minister of Finance, has given  additional
sums of money. I have written to all the premiers today to say please,  this
money is for education. But one has to fight  for  it.  This  money  is  not
meant to be sent somewhere else.

The constitutional provision we accepted as a compromise  in  1994  is  that
the provinces get the bulk sum of the money. They  then  decide  where  they
are going to spend the money. That is why in the Western Cape,  of  all  the
provinces in South Africa, the actual percentage of money  out  of  the  big
lump sum has fallen over the last four years,  whereas  in  Gauteng  it  has
gone up. [Interjections.] So it is up to the province and the MEC  to  fight
for the resources for early childhood education. [Interjections.]

Let me refer to what Gauteng did. They closed down, by public notice,  early
childhood schools, because they were in  certain  geographical  areas  only.
Therefore the majority of the population of Gauteng could not get access  to
the schools. They were wholly virtually all of one race.  They  closed  them
down to  use  that  money  for  purposes  of  wider  distribution  in  early
childhood education and many of the provinces prefer doing that.

As for Mr Raju, what does one say? [Laughter.] What does one  say  about  Mr
Raju's extreme language? He may be the messenger, and  I  believe  in  never
shooting the messenger [Interjections.] I do not think it is worth  it,  or,
to give another analogy, the organ-grinder and the monkey. I  believe  never
shoot the monkey, go for the organ-grinder. It  is  the  organ-grinder  that
decides this. [Laughter.]

Hon members must know it is a remarkable thing  for  Mr  Raju  to  say  that
there are tugs of war taking place. What tug of war? The provinces have  not
fully developed the school governing bodies to perform  their  function,  in
my view. That is why I am cutting out the review, because  I  go  around  to
speak to the associations of school governing bodies and  met  with  the  SA
Association of School Governing Bodies only last week. They said  that  they
need more resources and that they want to set  up  federal  bodies,  and  so
forth. So I go to people on the ground and listen to them  and  it  is  very
uneven.

Therefore, in the light of the fact that teachers are not  being  appointed,
as they deserve to be appointed, we have to review this. There is no tug  of
war. However, if one wants to say that everything is hunky-dory in the  area
of school governing bodies, then of course one is taking a  big  imaginative
leap. It is a leap of the imagination, because one does not understand  what
is happening on the ground.  I  think  we  should  draw  a  veil  along  the
contribution of the hon Mr Raju, because we  cannot  really  say  much  more
about it.

Finally, let me turn to the very important question  of  capacity.  I  think
many members of the House, who made positive  contributions,  have  referred
to the need to build the capacity of school governing bodies in one  way  or
the other. I think members of Parliament and this  House  can  help  in  the
building of capacity and we can do so, because we  cannot  depend  on  civil
servants and the provincial authorities  only.  So  I  ask  then  that  this
should be a national mobilisation for  democracy,  because  these  are  very
important elements. However, we have to review  exactly  how  they  operate,
and there is no point in subscribing to some kind of  artificial  commitment
when we know on the ground the position may be different.

May I end by making a pleasant announcement. I am pleased  that  the  United
Nations has invited a South African to play a lead part in  the  World  Aids
Day event, together with the President of the General  Assembly.  The  guest
of honour will be Whoopie Goldberg. The theme in New York will be "live  and
let live", with the focus  on  the  stigma  and  discrimination  that  often
accompanies the disease.

It is therefore most appropriate that our ambassador  will  be  a  five-year
old girl who is vibrant, friendly, optimistic and HIV positive.  Fortunately
she is supported by understanding and  accepting  family  and  friends.  She
shares this experience with millions of South African  children  every  day.
The girl is of course Kami, our newest moppet  on  Takalani  Sesame  Street,
the South African children's TV show. Her name, Kami, means  acceptance.  We
are glad to share her with the world on World  Aids  Day  and  South  Africa
once again shows leadership in coping with HIV/Aids, and, of course,  brings
in the finest principles in the educational system. I am proud, or  one  can
say proudly South African, that Kami will  be  the  ambassador.  Kami  is  a
South African creation, a South African product.

I commend  this  Bill  to  hon  members.  It  is  necessary  because  it  is
conditioned by our own needs in our country and in  the  light  of  our  own
review. Intelligent people  will  always  review.  Like  all  relationships,
personal relationships too, one reviews them now and then,  because  if  one
does not review them and the mountain slides and hits  one,  one  would  not
know why this has happened. We want to know why things happen  and  that  is
why  I  commend  those  eight  provinces  that  after  their   own   intense
discussion, as we know, have supported this Bill. [Applause.]

                       HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The  MINISTER  OF   EDUCATION:   Madam   Chairperson,   this   is   a   very
straightforward piece of legislation, but it allows  me  therefore  to  make
one or two general points of interest.

I think there is little doubt  that  in  the  broad  canvas  of  educational
change and transformation, this year has been the year of higher  education,
and my staff and I have spent more time on  higher  education  than  on  any
other  issue.  The  Cabinet's  approval  of  our  Ministry's  proposals  for
restructuring and transformation of the institutional  landscape  in  higher
education  in  May  2002  has  set  the  stage  to  give   effect   to   the
implementation of a framework for the renewal and development of our  higher
education system, as outlined in the national plan for higher  education  of
early 2002.

The ensuing debate - and there  has  been  a  debate,  including  the  legal
challenge to the Government's  proposal  to  establish  a  single  dedicated
distance education institution through the merger  of  Unisa,  Technikon  SA
and part of Vista University  -  has  placed  the  restructuring  of  higher
education in the centre of public  debate  on  education.  In  this  regard,
therefore, I have been privileged in the  last  months  to  have  interacted
with a wide range of higher education institutions and  constituencies  with
regard to  restructuring  proposals.  In  addition  to  this,  I  have  also
received representations and restructuring  proposals  which  I  invited  in
June of this year.
These interactions and representations have been useful in assisting  me  to
make my decisions  regarding  the  restructuring  of  the  higher  education
landscape. I want to  make  it  quite  clear  that  in  good  faith  I  have
addressed  every  one   of   the   representations   made,   including   the
representations from the Council for Higher  Education,  the  South  African
Universities Vice-chancellors' Association, and the Committee  of  Technikon
Principals. One must work on that basis and there has to be a large  element
of ownership by the institutions themselves  before  the  restructuring  and
development of higher education take place.

Clearly, what we have to do, is to make the effort  to  ensure  that  future
generations will graduate from higher  education  institutions  but  owe  no
allegiance to the geopolitical imagination of  apartheid's  planners  if  we
are to make significant progress.

As members know, the council of Unisa has withdrawn its legal  challenge  to
the establishment of a single dedicated distance education institution,  and
therefore it is back on track. More importantly, with all the problems  that
these kinds of mergers have, the M L Sultan Technikon  and  Technikon  Natal
have successfully merged, and a new institution,  the  Durban  Institute  of
Technology, has been  established.  Certainly,  this  goes  a  long  way  in
strengthening higher education in KwaZulu-Natal. And  also,  the  acceptance
by the University of Natal and the University of Durban-Westville that  they
should merge, in the best interests of Durban and  the  region,  is  also  a
development. The acceptance by the University of  Zululand  that  they  will
move towards technikon-type education is enormously significant. This  shows
that the groves of Academe are not filled  only  with  conservative  people.
And the move towards Richard's Bay, in co-operation with Richard's  Bay,  as
part of the technical training, again, is an important development.

Therefore, the main reason for the introduction of the amending Bill  is  to
facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  restructuring  and  transformation
agenda. So, as the restructuring process unfolds, it will  be  necessary  to
review and amend the Higher Education Act,  as  the  legal  implications  of
existing policy are clarified, gaps  in  the  Act  are  identified  and  new
policies are introduced.

In this regard the amending  Bill  has  two  purposes:  first  to  introduce
technical amendments;  to  clarify  and  bring  legal  certainty  to  issues
related to the merger  of  institutions  such  as  the  authority  to  merge
institutions; labour relations implications  of  mergers;  and  implications
for  students  in  terms  of  rules  and  regulations   governing   academic
programmes. We are  sensitive,  for  example,  to  the  fact  that  at  some
institutions lower fees are paid than at the institution with which it  will
merge. We must take into account the legislative expectations in this area.

Secondly, we have to introduce amendments  that  streamline  and  strengthen
the governance structures of higher  education  institutions.  I  intend  to
focus my remarks on the second set of amendments.

Good governance, as we  know,  is  the  cornerstone  of  a  well-functioning
higher education system. It  is  the  lever  that  enables  the  pursuit  of
academic freedom  and  institutional  autonomy  in  the  context  of  public
accountability.  So  the  existence  of  properly  constituted,  functioning
councils is essential - as members know, and as Madam Chairperson  knows  in
her own role as chancellor  of  an  institution  -  to  ensure  that  higher
education institutions  are  able  to  respond  to  the  demands  of  public
accountability, in particular  to  demonstrate  financial  honesty  and  the
capacity to meet national policy  goals  and  priorities.  This  is  however
sadly lacking in a number of our higher education institutions.

The absence of good  governance  is  in  large  measure  a  product  of  the
composition of their councils, which are unnecessarily large. In some  cases
the councils are like mass rallies. The only thing that is missing  is  that
there is no toyi-toying of the councillors, but presumably they are too  old
or too rotund to toyi-toyi into the dining-room. There are up to 50  members
sometimes. That is very unwieldy. This is the end result  of  the  post-1994
flourish  of  democracy,  with  its  focus  of  transforming,  rightly   so,
undemocratic and unrepresentative councils to change them.  So  we  had  all
kinds of stakeholders who had to be in a council.

However, in invoking the spirit of democracy, little  or  no  attention  was
paid to the impact of large councils, representative  as  they  may  be,  on
efficiency  and  effectiveness.  Councils  became  debating  chambers,  with
meetings lasting eight, nine and ten hours. No decisions  were  taken  as  a
result. In particular, no attention was paid to ensuring that  councils  had
the necessary expertise to deal with the academic,  educational,  legal  and
fiduciary responsibilities.

Although my department  has  initiated  a  training  programme  for  council
members, it is clear that the  necessary  expertise  is  a  product  of  the
accumulation of social capital, which the majority of our people  have  been
denied by apartheid. I am referring to that  kind  of  social  capital  that
gives us an idea about precision, about the role of the  council,  the  role
of debate, and the necessity to come to conclusions.

In the light of this, the amending Bill limits  the  size  of  institutional
councils to a maximum of 30 members, while keeping  the  principle  that  at
least 60% of the members must be external to the institution,  from  outside
the institution. Although, forgive me, left to myself, I  have  always  felt
that the majority  of  councillors  should  be  academics  from  within  the
institution, because in the  end  the  council's  job  is  to  ensure,  with
assent, that teaching, research and community outreach take place.  However,
I give way to the great flourish of democracy in 1994, that the majority  of
the members of council must be from outside the institution.

The amending Bill also increases the  size  of  interim  councils.  I  shall
explain what interim councils are. They are established  to  assist  in  the
merger of higher education  institutions.  We  see  that  at  present  their
current members number five. Now we have increased the minimum of five to  a
minimum of seven, or a maximum of nine  members.  This  amendment  seeks  to
ensure that  the  size  of  interim  councils  provides  for  the  expertise
necessary to discharge its functions efficiently and effectively. I want  to
state that the provisions for  establishing  interim  councils,  which  were
introduced in the amending legislation of 2001, were not an attempt, as  one
paper said, to centralise power in the  hands  of  the  Minister.  Once  the
interim council is set up, they have  the  same  authority  as  the  present
council  of  institutions.  I  have  no  authority  to  intervene   in   the
functioning of councils, although I am under great pressure, every  now  and
then. I  am  asked  why  I  do  not  dismiss  the  vice-chancellor,  or  the
registrar, or this or that person, or dissolve the  council,  which  is  the
general demand every time a slight problem arises.

So the interim councils are transitional  bodies,  necessary  to  facilitate
the merger of higher education institutions. They  have  specific  functions
and a limited shelf life - six months, with a possible further  six  months.
The members of the council,  except  the  chairperson,  are  appointed  from
nominees submitted by the affected institution. They  submit  the  nominees.
The only prerogative I have is the appointment  of  the  chairperson,  which
does not confer any additional powers on the Minister. Once the  chairperson
is appointed, he, or she, I hope, acts in a fiduciary capacity as  the  head
of  the  interim  council.  There  is  nothing   precluding   the   affected
institution submitting nominees to me for the  chairperson's  position,  for
me to consider.

So the point must be emphasised that the interim councils function with  the
same authority and autonomy as normal present day institutional councils.

I briefly want to turn my attention to a critical issue that  underpins  the
restructuring and transformation agenda and which is not  addressed  in  the
amending Bill. This is the issue of access, both in terms of increasing  the
participation rate in higher education, as well as ensuring  that  there  is
equity in the access. The national plan for higher education indicated  that
race and gender access should be  facilitated  by  the  establishment  of  a
national higher education information and application service,  which  would
have a number of benefits, including providing information on the  available
pool of 36 institutions, satisfying the information needs of applicants  for
every available career opportunity, providing  career  guidance  information
by faculty, what scholarships  are  available  in  each  faculty,  and  most
important of all, a national  financial  aid  application  form.  This  will
enable the Government to monitor  progress  in  achieving  race  and  gender
access.

We have established that the participation rate for Coloureds  and  Africans
is appallingly low by our standards. Fourteen percent of those eligible,  in
the age group 18 to 20, have access to higher education. For Indians, it  is
about 37%. For whites it is about 45%. This puts Indians  and  whites  in  a
privileged category of participation. In Holland, only  35%  of  the  cohort
goes to higher education. We cannot continue tolerating this.  That  is  why
we are getting more money for the national financial aid scheme.  This  year
it is R80 million; I cannot disclose what it will be next year -  I  am  not
allowed to do that yet. This means therefore that 90 000 students  in  need,
black and white by the way, will be eligible for assistance.

What will help also is that I have received a report of  the  working  group
appointed to  investigate  the  development  of  an  appropriate  model  for
establishing  a  national  higher  education  information  and   application
service. The report  will  soon  be  released  for  public  comment,  and  I
anticipate that the service will be established during the  course  of  next
year.

It will be a great advance, that in Grade 11 all of our children  will  have
information about 36 institutions and the hundreds and hundreds  of  courses
available, including all the  facilities  that  may  be  there.  So  I  look
forward to a debate on this.

I end by saying I am confident that the amending Bill, together  with  other
processes that are in place  to  implement  the  national  plan  for  higher
education, moves us ever  closer  to  the  goal  of  establishing  a  single
national co-ordinator for the higher education system  that  is  affordable,
of high quality and responsive to the human resource and knowledge needs  of
South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Madam Chair, hon Minister, hon members, distinguished  guests
from the provinces, the National Plan  for  Higher  Education  announced  in
February 2001 noted that the victory over the apartheid state  in  1994  set
policy-makers in spheres of public life the mammoth task of overhauling  the
social, political, economic and cultural institutions  of  South  Africa  to
bring them in line with the imperative of the new democratic order.

The  vision  for  transformation  of  the  higher   education   system   was
articulated in the  third  White  Paper  on  education,  the  Programme  for
Transformation of Higher Education 1997. Central  to  this  vision  was  the
establishment of a single national co-ordinated system which would meet  the
learning needs of our citizens, black and white, women and the disabled.

Our ANC-led Government has given an overwhelming  mandate  to  excavate  our
higher education system from its apartheid-induced depths and elevate it  to
the desired levels of sustainability.

So what is the situation at some of our  institutions  of  higher  learning?
Firstly, it is common knowledge that we have inherited  a  higher  education
system fraught with mismanagement  and  corruption.  In  addition,  we  have
institutions that  are  enormously  underdeveloped  on  the  one  hand,  and
enormously overdeveloped on the other. Teaching levels and  the  quality  of
research at some institutions are poor.

We have discovered that some  institutions  cannot  even  provide  enrolment
figures for the past three  years.  Moreover,  the  drop-out  rate  at  both
historically black and historically white universities is unacceptably  high
and of serious concern  to  Government.  Another  irrationality  originating
from the past is the fact that our  technikons  were  never  founded  to  do
research.

Secondly, and importantly, the Ministry's  proposal  for  restructuring  and
transformation, which was approved by Cabinet in May  this  year,  may  lead
the way to a higher education system that ensures equity, increases  access,
builds research capacity and brings the present  academic  culture  in  line
with that of the vision and values of  a  nonracial,  nonsexist,  democratic
South Africa.

These proposals are paramount if we  are  to  realise  our  objective  of  a
critical mass of black intellectuals to contribute  to  the  development  of
our broad skills base of qualified professionals, which is  central  to  our
human resource development strategy, and more importantly,  is  critical  to
the success of the New Partnership for Africa's Development.

The 36 higher learning institutions inherited from the past  are  all  South
African institutions. They must  be  embraced  as  such,  transformed  where
necessary and put to work on behalf of all South Africans. In the  words  of
the national working group, they should be fit for their purpose.

It is for this reason that the Higher Education  Amendment  Bill  is  before
this House today. It seeks to clarify the  legal  implications  and  provide
the  legal  framework  for  the  entire  restructuring  and   transformation
exercise. It also introduces technical amendments to  the  Higher  Education
Act with regard to labour relations,  as  has  already  been  mentioned,  in
terms of the rights and obligations of employees and merged institutions  as
new employers. The Bill clarifies the rules and  regulations  pertaining  to
the conduct of students and academic programmes.

More importantly,  the  imperative  for  higher  education  institutions  of
learning to prosper is the need for good governance. It is  the  fundamental
principle that translates into academic  excellence,  public  accountability
and financial sustainability. In this  respect  the  Bill  provides  for  an
increase in the size of interim  councils,  namely  from  the  present  five
members to a minimum of seven and a maximum of nine members. This  amendment
seeks to ensure a broader pool  of  expertise  for  the  attainment  of  the
aforementioned objectives, which is quite frankly absent in a number of  our
institutions.

In conclusion, the ANC-led Government  is  committed  to  pushing  back  the
frontiers of social engineering of the past. We will  continue  to  lay  the
foundations from which higher education will contribute  critically  to  the
reconstruction and development of our country and that of the  continent  in
the twenty-first century. We support the Bill.

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, the hon the Minister, hon special  delegates,  hon
colleagues, the Bill seeks to clarify and bring legal  certainty  to  issues
on which the Higher Education Act, Act 101 of 1997, is currently  silent  or
ambiguous. These include  transitional  arrangements  relating  to  academic
programmes offered by institutions prior to a  merger,  labour  relations  -
the amendment seeks to make it clear that all contracts of  employment  will
automatically be transferred by law to the new institution - and clarity  on
the authority to take the decision to merge and to give a name and  physical
location to the new institution.

The  Bill  further  provides  for  changes  in  the  size  of  councils  and
institutional forums, and the appointment of an  administrator  when  it  is
deemed that the council of a higher education institution has resigned.  The
administrator will take over effective government of the council.

The Higher Education  Amendment  Bill  thus  amends  the  principal  Act  to
provide for consequential matters arising out of  declarations  and  mergers
of public higher education institutions. The hon the Minister's task in  re-
engineering the landscape of higher education institutions in  South  Africa
has the full support of my party. However, the hon  the  Minister  has  been
the target of some unfair  criticism  from  the  unlikeliest  quarters.  For
instance,  certain  black  academics  have  criticised  these  attempts   at
mergers; worse, certain black journalists as well.

To his credit, the hon  Minister  has  discharged  his  duties  towards  the
transformation of higher learning  institutions  with  steadfast  commitment
and we applaud his efforts. The DP  has  no  hesitation  in  supporting  the
Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr F ADAMS: Geagte Voorsitter, Ministers en lede, die  Nuwe  NP  ondersteun
die Wysingswetsontwerp op Hoër Onderwys. Die doelwitte van  die  wetsontwerp
is baie  duidelik:  om  te  verseker  dat  programme  wat  deur  instellings
aangebied  is  voor  'n  samesmelting  voortgesit  word  na  die   voormelde
samesmelting; om te verseker dat alle dienskontrakte outomaties volgens  wet
oorgedra word  na  die  nuwe  instelling;  om  a  maksimum  ledetal  vir  'n
universiteit- of technikonraad  te  bepaal;  en  om  uit  te  klaar  wanneer
ministeriële  goedkeuring  nodig  is  ten  opsigte  van  lenings  deur  hoër
onderwysinstellings.

Ek wil net die volgende opmerkings maak. Geen samesmelting sal slaag as  dit
nie die goedkeuring van al die  betrokkenes  geniet  nie.  Taalpatrone  moet
vasgestel word deur taaloudits voordat 'n finale  besluit  oor  samesmelting
geneem word.

Ons wil graag aankondig dat die Nuwe NP die wetsontwerp steun.  (Translation
of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, Ministers and members, the  New  NP  supports  the
Higher Education Amendment Bill. The aims of the Bill  are  very  clear:  to
ensure  that  programmes  offered  by  institutions  before  a  merger  will
continue after the proposed merger; to ensure  that  all  service  contracts
automatically be carried over to the new institution according  to  law;  to
determine the maximum number  of  members  for  a  university  or  technikon
board; and to get clearance when ministerial approval is needed in terms  of
loans by higher education institutions.

I would just like to make the following remarks. No merger will  succeed  if
it does not carry the approval of all parties concerned.  Language  patterns
should be established  through  language  audits  before  a  final  decision
regarding merging can take place. I would like to announce that the  New  NP
supports the Bill.]

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Ngiyabonga Sihlalo nendlu  yonke,  mhlonishwa  Ngqongqoshe
nabo bonke abakhona. Ngiyanibingelela nonke.

Okokuqala nje namhlanjena nje sicabanga ukuthi lo  mthetho  lo  okukhulunywa
ngawo  osezithebeni,  ubaluleke  ngendlela  emangalisayo.  Imfundo   yezinga
eliphakeme  ibalulekile  kuwo  wonke  umuntu.  Ikakhulu   kubantwana   bethu
abakhulayo.

Angizokwanda ngamazwi  amaningi,  sebekhulumile,  nami  ngiyavumelana  nakho
konke abakushoyo. Engingakusho nje ukuthi umuntu ohlala futhi ophila  kuleli
zwe laseSouth Africa wazi kahle ukuthi imfundo okukhulunywa ngayo  namhlanje
inezinkinga  ezingakanani,  ikakhulu   kubantu   abanjengami   nje   abavela
ekuhluphekeni.

Siyazi  ukuthi  imfundo  beyiphethwe  kanjani  ngesikhathi   esingaphambili.
Umhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe  uyazama  ukuthi  imfundo   ifanelane   nesikhathi
esiphila kuso,  kuwo  wonke  umuntu  ophila  kuleli  zwe.  Kodwa  mhlonishwa
Ngqongqoshe nakhu okusanyomfa nje kancane. Inkinga  yokuxhasa  intsha  yethu
ehlose ukufunda. Uthola ukuthi umntwana  uhlakaniphile  uphase  kahle  kodwa
manje uvela emndenini ophansi, kutholakale ukuthi  uxhaso  lukhishiwe  kodwa
abalutholi abantwana. Lokhu sibona engathi kuyinkinga.

Uma  kuvulwa  nje  amanyuvesi  namaThekhinikhoni,  behla  benyuka  abantwana
abanye  baze  baphele  amandla  bahlale  emakhaya  bangabe  besafunda   baze
bahlaselwe izinkinga, bathole nalezi zifo  eziningi  eziqeda  intsha  yethu.
Ngakho-ke  impela  siyacela  sengathi  uxhaso  lungaba  khona  futhi   lube-
transparent. Kungabi yinto nje engabonakali. Abantwana uma belufuna  uxhaso,
kungabantwana    abakhuthele,    abahlakaniphile,    baluthole    ngaphandle
kwezinkinga. Siyazi  sonke  ukuthi  abazali  ezindaweni  ikakhulukazi  lapho
ngivela khona kwaZulu,  abasebenzi.  Imisebenzi  ayikho.  Izingane  azikwazi
ukuqhubeka nemfundo ngaphandle kwemali nemisebenzi nokunye.

Okunye mhlawumbe engingakusho nje  okuncane  ngingakahlali  phansi,  uguquko
olubonakalayo ukuthi  alukho  kahle  hle  ezindaweni  lezi  ezabe  ziphethwe
abamhlophe. Okusho ukuthi kuyothatha isikhathi.

Bayazithatha bona  izingane  ezixubile  zonke  izinhlanga  ngiyavuma,  kodwa
kusekhona lokho ukuthi akukakabi bikho kahle ukuhoshelana  ukuthi  abantwana
bafunde kahle ngokukhululeka.

Mhlawumbe futhi okunye okuba yinkinga kodwa engibona umnyango  kaNgqongqoshe
uyilungisa, yilena yolimi. Njengoba ngimi lapha  ngikhuluma  nje  sengithole
izincomo eziningi kabi ngaphandle. Kuthiwa  awu  siyajabula  uyaye  ukhulume
sizwe, siyaye sikuzwe ukhuluma. Lokho kuyaye kungithokozise impela  yingakho
nje sengithi phambili ngolimi lwami impela  ngizokhuluma  ngalo  noma  ngabe
kuthiwani. Ngoba ngiyazithola izincomo.

Esokugcina siqhamuka kuProf. Marivate naye engcoma esho ethi  awu  siyakuzwa
impela kusho ukuthi  uya-promotha  izilimi  lezi  esifuna  ukuthi  ziqhubeke
lapho, futhi ikakhulu-ke thina ngoba  sisebenza  lapha  kwi-NCOP.  Ngakho-ke
ulimi luyokhulula abantwana ekutheni bathola njalo ophesenti  abangabonakali
abacimezile. Njalo ezethu izingane kodwa  abanye  bathole  laphaya  phezulu.
Ulimi phela ngoba abanye bafunda ngolimi  lwabo  abalujwayele.  Laba  abethu
bafunda  njalo  ngokuciciyela.  Njengoba  lufakwa  nje   siyethemba   ukuthi
zizokhululeka izingane.

Nikeza umuntu ulimi lwakhe  uyobe  umnikeze  inkululeko  engaphezu  kwezinto
zonke.  Ngakho-ke  siyathokoza  kakhulu  sithi   uyazama.   Thina   beNkatha
siyakusekela Ngqongqoshe. Siyavuma ukuthi  uyazama  impela  umsebenzi  wakho
uyabonakala. Siyasaphotha,  siyavumelana,  sikusekela  ngokukhulu.  Sengathi
kungaqhubeka kuye  phambili.  Ngiyabonga.  (Translation  of  isiZulu  speech
follows.)

[Thank you, Chairperson. I would like to greet  the  honourable  House,  hon
Minister and all the people who are present.

Today we think that the Bill  that  is  on  the  table  is  very  important.
Tertiary education is important to everyone, especially to our children  who
are still growing.

I will not talk too much. Many people have already spoken and I  agree  with
them. What I can say is those who live in and are citizens of  South  Africa
know very well that the education that we are talking about today  has  many
problems, especially for people like me who have a poor background.

We know how education was administered before. The hon  Minister  is  trying
to make education meet the challenges of today for everyone living  at  this
time. But, hon Minister, there is something that is  still  not  right,  and
that is the problem of financially assisting our students  who  are  serious
about studying. One finds that a child is bright and  she  or  he  has  good
grades but comes from a poor family. One finds that sponsorships  exist  but
students cannot access them. We think that this is a problem.

When colleges and universities open, students will  go  up  and  down  until
they despair. Then they will stay at home and be besieged by problems.  They
will end up getting the diseases  that  destroy  our  youth.  Therefore,  we
would like to ask that sponsorships be made available and that  this  should
be transparent. It should not be something invisible. When students who  are
bright and diligent  need  sponsorship,  they  should  get  it  without  any
problem.

We all know that many parents in places such as KwaZulu-Natal, where I  come
from, are unemployed. There are no  jobs.  Children  cannot  continue  their
education if their parents do not have money and jobs.

Another small thing that I can mention before I sit down is that  change  in
the traditionally white schools is not satisfactory. This means that  it  is
going to take time. I agree that they accept children  of  different  races.
However, there are still problems which  cause  children  to  be  unable  to
study freely. Another problem that I see that the Minister's  department  is
rectifying, is that of language. As I am standing here, I  have  received  a
number of compliments from people  outside.  People  are  saying:  ``We  are
happy that you speak the language that we understand.'' This makes  me  very
happy and that is why I say ``forward with my language''. I will use  it  no
matter what because I get compliments.

The last compliment I received came from Prof Marivate. She appreciated  the
fact that I speak these languages, because it means  that  I  am  out  there
promoting these languages that we are developing. This  is  more  important,
especially for us, because we work here in the NCOP. Language will  liberate
children from getting bad marks, which always happens to our children  while
others get high marks. Our children always  pass  with  difficulty.  As  the
language policy is implemented, I hope that children will be liberated.
When one gives a language to a person,  ones  gives  him  superior  freedom.
Therefore, we are very pleased and we say that the Minister is  doing  well.
We in the IFP support him. We appreciate the  fact  that  he  is  doing  his
best. His efforts are remarkable. We support his  effort  and  we  wish  him
further progress.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, hon Minister and other  Ministers  present,  hon
members, it gives me great pleasure to participate in this important  debate
today. The transformation and restructuring of the higher  education  system
in its present form has sparked huge debate, controversy and legal  threats,
not only in the 36 institutions, but also in  the  wider  public  domain  of
alumni and corporate stakeholders.

As is the case in any debate of this nature, some  of  it  was  constructive
while there was also a fair amount of resistance. The latter  we  regard  as
necessary, since it provides us with an opportunity to convince  those  with
narrow, selfish and sectarian interests of our vision  to  create  a  higher
education system that is rational, seamless and responsive to the needs  and
challenges of our country and that  of  the  continent,  and  ultimately  of
globalisation in the twenty-first century.

Also, we in the  ANC  believe  that  these  narrow,  selfish  and  sectarian
interests should not be allowed to stand in the  way  of  the  restructuring
process. Our country requires institutions with particular  social  mandates
and a diversity of institutions with different and  distinct  missions.  The
heart  of  the  system  must  be   well-resourced,   high-quality   teaching
institutions,  oriented  towards  the  production  of  graduates  with   the
knowledge, skills and competencies to contribute to the economy  and  social
development of our country. Institutions with this mandate  must  constitute
the bedrock of our higher education system.

Yes, these institutions are definitely going to be fewer  in  number,  given
that they will be reduced from the present 36 to 21. But this  restructuring
will address the weaknesses, strengths  and  technological  demands  of  our
country, especially our peri-urban, rural and remote areas.

The Bill before this  House  today  seeks  to  achieve  the  above-mentioned
objectives through the following amendments to  the  Higher  Education  Act.
Allow me to dwell on clauses 2, 3 and 4 as they relate  to  labour,  student
matters and consequential issues as a result of the declaration  of  mergers
of public higher education institutions. These amendments are  necessary  to
bring legal certainty to issues on which the  Act  is  currently  silent  or
ambiguous.

The amendments include transitional arrangements relating to,  for  example,
the academic programmes offered  by  institutions  prior  to  a  merger  and
incorporation or declaration. Provision is made to enable  these  programmes
to be offered by the new institution under the same rules applicable to  the
old institutions until the new council amends such programmes.

Clauses 6, 7  and  14  reduce  the  number  of  members  from  the  internal
constituencies and determine the maximum  membership  of  each  council.  At
present many public higher education  institutions  have  large  and  clumsy
councils, and this amendment will ensure streamlining of such councils.

Clause 8 clarifies the position of the Minister in terms of the approval  of
borrowing  by  these  institutions,  because  the  current  provisions   are
interpreted in more ways than one. We welcome this, since some  institutions
have displayed sheer disregard for public  funds,  and  have  incurred  huge
debts because of this.

Clauses 9 and 13 extend the power  of  the  Minister  to  make  regulations.
These  amendments  seek  to  ensure  that  policies  are  contained  in  the
regulations to ensure  uniformity  across  the  higher  education  spectrum,
meaning private and public higher education.

In conclusion, transformation and  restructuring  of  the  higher  education
landscape and its entrenched culture  is  inevitable,  given  the  country's
demographics. Moreover, the  demand  for  equity,  increased  access,  human
resource development, improved quality and the building of our  intellectual
leadership are the  realities  facing  us.  The  Bill  before  us  therefore
represents a watershed in the sense that it will enable us to  engage  these
demands in a forthright manner.

To give members a typical example: in the Free State the  community  leaders
continue to make meaningful contributions to  the  University  of  the  Free
State because the  university  itself  went  to  Qwaqwa  to  give  community
leaders there a forum on the incorporation of the University of Qwaqwa  with
the University of the Free State. The uniqueness of  the  Qwaqwa  university
is to be preserved, enriched -  both  academically  and  financially  -  and
utilised to greater extent by  the  community  where  it  is  situated.  The
University of the Free State has to give up  some  of  its  traditions  that
were exclusively for one ethnic group. It is with great excitement that  the
university is now acknowledging that it is multi-ethnic in its student  body
and faculty. The institutions have planned to share more of their  resources
to enable the Qwaqwa university to offer a wider diversity in the fields  of
education and training. Both these institutions  of  learning  and  training
auger well for the future. They remain  uniquely  Free  State  institutions,
while they maintain  international  standards,  even  for  our  neighbouring
countries and abroad.

More give-and-take is promised and must  be  implemented  expeditiously.  In
the land of the birth of the oldest political party in the country - I  mean
the ANC - there is firm support for the Bill. We concur. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Chairperson, it is very pleasant,  as  some
of us retire for the vacation and the break, that goodwill  has  broken  out
in this House. It is remarkable. I  will  leave  tonight  with  the  highest
pleasant feelings, and I can therefore say one or two things that are  meant
to assist.

A very famous antifascist poet, Bertolt  Brecht,  wrote  a  lovely  poem,  A
Tribute to the Soldier:


  When the battle of the mountains  is  over,  the  battle  of  the  plains
  begins.

We have  finished  the  battle  of  the  mountains  with  our  extraordinary
constitutional arrangement of 1994, and the real battle of  the  plains,  of
how we can change, adapt, renew, develop, bring new traditions  in,  contest
traditions and work out new solutions, now begins. That is why  I  was  very
struck by the Rev Chabaku's intervention, because, in fact, it  shows  great
understanding. She pitches to the Free State,  the  crucible  of  apartheid.
And now we find a Free Stater being very proud of what is happening as  they
change and renew the institution.

One of the things we have already done is to transfer the  Qwaqwa  component
of the University of the North to the  University  of  the  Free  State.  Of
course, there are problems with it. But problems have to be  dealt  with  on
the basis that South Africans are trying  to  arrive  at  common  solutions,
recognising, of course, where the differential lies. All I can say  is  that
it is not everybody who is opposed to the proposals on the grounds of  self-
interest. Not everybody is doing it because they  are  conservative  and  do
not wish to change. There are genuine anxieties and difficulties. As I  have
said earlier, I will address all of these. Nothing  is  cast  in  stone.  It
cannot be, otherwise there could not be  a  dialogue  about  the  needs  and
other things.

But extraordinary things happen. The University of Potchefstroom has  agreed
to merge with the University of the North West.  What  kind  of  development
can one say this is? The imagination boggles at the idea of  the  University
of Potchefstroom merging with the University of the North  West.  They  both
agreed it is in the best interests of the region and, of  course,  of  South
Africa itself. So we will look at everything  and  attend  to  every  matter
raised.

Can I also say to my sister, hon Vilakazi, who comes from my home  province,
that I entirely agree  with  her,  but  the  access  to  education  is  very
important. There are problems, not in higher  education  alone.  How  do  we
keep the poor young people at school when they are 17 or 18 years old?  They
are really adults. No one whose family earns less than R90 000 -  which  may
go up to R100 000 - can ever say I cannot go to higher  education,  provided
they have the results. We are targeting the poor, including Afrikaners  from
the southern suburbs of Johannesburg - that is very  important  -  and  poor
Indians, because up to now about 90% has gone to Africans, and R232 000  has
gone to higher education through the financial aid scheme.

No one whose family earns less than R90 000 a year is  ever  precluded  from
access to higher education. It is our job, therefore, to  ensure  that  they
know about it. That is why a national information system will be set  up  to
convey the information. There are not only scholarships from  the  provinces
and faculties, but there are hundreds of scholarships given  by  benefactors
in their wills and trustees. We want to bring that all together, and get  it
into the hands of approximately 700 000 Grade 11 students  in  our  country,
so they can make real choices.

So the real problem is sustaining them when they are about  16,  17  and  18
years of age, when they are in high school. That is the real problem.

The  second  problem  is,  of  course,  the  question  of  acceptability  in
institutions. At nearly every institution,  apart  from  the  University  of
Stellenbosch, the majority of students are now black.  It  is  a  remarkable
change in 10 years. There has been this extraordinary access. But  the  real
problem is: How many students come out at the end of the cycle?  The  answer
is 15%. The through-put rate is 15%. This is  astonishingly  low.  In  other
words, thousands of young people are frustrated in their intentions and  are
never able to fulfil themselves, for various reasons. One of the reasons,  I
think, apart from financial,  is,  in  fact,  the  disappointment  with  the
courses they are doing and the kind  of  relationship  they  have  with  the
institution.

We cannot afford a loss of 85% of our input, and that is why  we  must  look
at the national plan for higher education,  and  not  only  with  regard  to
mergers, change and the transfer of topics and subjects.  We  must  look  at
what happens in the institutions. That is why we want to start a  debate  on
this. Therefore it is important that we recognise, as my  sister  does  too,
that language is very important.

Can I end therefore, because I will put this in the library  of  Parliament.
But to judge from the newspapers, nothing happened yesterday  -  apart  from
Die Burger, which led with this story. There is a national framework  -  not
the actual plan, but the framework for higher  education  language.  And  we
say for the first time, which is a historic occasion, that we carry out  the
constitutional prescription about multilingualism. For  the  first  time  we
can say that there must be parity of esteem for all our languages  in  South
Africa. For the first time we say  we  must  move  our  policies  towards  a
proper understanding  that  the  indigenous  languages  must  be  built  up,
developed,  and  that  it  should  be  possible,  in  the  long  term,   for
instruction to be given in one or two indigenous languages, as  proposed  by
the Council for Higher Education, and accepted by  the  department  and  the
Cabinet. It is a wonderful development, because we are  then  giving  esteem
and support for the indigenous languages.

It is very important that our institutions  offer  multilingualism  and,  of
course, foreign languages, not because of our diplomats  who  are  going  to
work  elsewhere,  not  only  for  commerce,  but  simply  for   intellectual
development. It is good that our young people should have access to  foreign
languages.  Traditionally  it  is  French  and  German.  Now  it  could   be
Portuguese, Swahili I hope, Arabic, etc. And if we can get  the  money  from
the  Chinese  government,  we  introduce  Chinese.  It  is  good  that   our
institutions should have that.

I say that the importance of this is that we  extend  language  requirements
in school. We recognise the position of English and Afrikaans  as  languages
of instruction in higher  education.  But  as  an  important  departure,  we
should develop the  other  African  languages  by  having  chairs  in  these
languages, and giving scholarship assistance in these languages. Can  I  say
that with regard to all 11 languages, hardly any student now, very few,  are
studying these languages as artistic, cultural and scientific languages.

The number studying Afrikaans as a subject  at  Stellenbosch,  Potchefstroom
and the Free State has fallen dramatically. The number studying  English  as
an honours subject has fallen dramatically. As for  the  African  languages,
members know what has happened up to now. We cannot  get  good  teachers  if
the languages are studied by themselves. Where will our writers  come  from?
Where will our poets, and cultural people with imagination come from  unless
the languages are studied? Part of the plan here  is  therefore  to  develop
interest in all the languages in higher education. Our long-term view is  to
ensure  that  at  least  two  universities  will  offer   African   language
instruction, one in Nguni and the other in Sotho languages.

Finally I come to the importance of Afrikaans, because this is part  of  the
larger language issue. We argue that  in  fact  Afrikaans  is  part  of  our
national assets in South Africa, and we have adopted the view of the  Gerwel
report that this national asset must be succoured, built  up  and  retained.
We  argue  that  Afrikaans  as  a  medium   of   academic   expression   and
communication in  higher  education  must  not  only  be  acknowledged,  but
developed.

We argue that in accordance with the vice chancellors  of  the  five  former
Afrikaans universities who spoke to Mr  Mandela,  and  then  Mr  Mbeki,  the
President now, that no institution wants to teach exclusively in  Afrikaans.
The  Gerwel  report  makes  it  quite  clear  too  that  none  of  the  vice
chancellors wants this. I say this very carefully because in  the  next  few
months we must adopt this policy in such a way that we do not  use  language
as a divisive factor. None of them - and they are directly involved -  wants
it exclusively, for the simple reason that none  of  the  five  institutions
are exclusively teaching in Afrikaans, none of them, without an exception.

What we are saying therefore is that an institution could have Afrikaans  as
a primary language of instruction - which is a remarkable  understanding  by
the Government - but not as a sole language of instruction.  No  institution
has that in South Africa. We cannot therefore turn the clock  back,  because
there are strategic areas, such  as  health  sciences  and  engineering  for
example, which must be accessible to all our people.

It is quite clear, as Mr Mandela said when he  got  an  honorary  degree  at
Stellenbosch, that the issue is not the survival of Afrikaans. The issue  is
whether language can be a bar to access,  not  affording  proper  access  to
institutions, which,  remember,  are  national  institutions.  They  do  not
belong to the Western Cape. That is why it is very important that we  should
not ride horses that become very unruly horses,  that  will  cause  a  great
deal of damage. I suggest to members  that  we  will  put  a  copy  of  this
policy, both the press statements, a copy  of  the  Gerwel  report  and  the
Council for Higher Education report in the library by tomorrow  morning,  so
that members can read it for themselves.

Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson, for your forbearance, and thank  you
to members of the House for their support. I look forward  to  further  such
creative debates in the new year. May you  have  a  very  good  constituency
period and about one week off during Christmas. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

     ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION OF ROAD TRAFFIC OFFENCES AMENDMENT BILL

               (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon.)

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson,  permanent  members,  delegates  and
friends, I  rise  to  introduce  the  Administrative  Adjudication  of  Road
Traffic Offences Amendment Bill of 2002.

I want to say that there  are  too  many  people  who  drive  recklessly  or
negligently or speed on our  roads,  who  drive  without  a  valid  driver's
licence, often with vehicles  that  are  not  roadworthy.  Too  many  commit
traffic offences of all kinds - some serious, and  others  not  so  serious.
Traffic violations are on the increase, and it is estimated that 80% of  all
notices of traffic contraventions - often referred to as traffic  tickets  -
and even summonses are  ignored  by  offenders.  Many  of  them  are  repeat
offenders. Some boast that they tear up  these  documents,  because  nothing
will happen to them. Hundreds of warrants of  arrest  are  issued;  many  of
them are not executed. In addition, our  court  system  is  overloaded.  Our
courts have to prioritise, and in the process  road  traffic  offences  find
themselves at the bottom of the list. The  net  result  is  a  situation  in
which thousands of road users all over the country  believe  that  they  can
commit traffic violations with impunity and get away with it, and that  they
can ignore traffic tickets and summonses and get away with it.

We plan to change all this. We are putting into place a  system  which  will
make offenders pay, and where they ignore processes, they will pay  heavily.
Repeat offenders will risk  having  their  driver's  licences  suspended  or
cancelled. These results will be achieved through the implementation of  the
Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act.

I am very much aware of the fact that provinces and some  local  authorities
have indeed tightened up law enforcement, and many of the defects  to  which
I have referred are being addressed. Many road users have  been  stopped  at
road blocks and even arrested for outstanding warrants and fines. This  will
continue. I recognise and acknowledge all these  efforts.  But  it  is  also
clear that we need to take drastic action and intervene to create a  culture
of law compliance.  There  will  only  exist  a  pervasive  culture  of  law
compliance  if  there  is  effective  law  enforcement  now.  That  is   why
Parliament passed the Administrative Adjudication of Road  Traffic  Offences
Act in 1998. I report to hon members today that we have  spent  considerable
time  and  effort  to  put  into  place  the  machinery  to  implement   the
Administrative Adjudication Road Traffic Offences Act, or AARTO, which is  a
new concept for South Africa. It is currently planned to  bring  AARTO  into
operation by mid-2003 - I hope it will be a little bit earlier  -  when  the
computer systems will be ready and in place.

Let me remind hon members of some of the essential  elements  of  the  AARTO
system: Firstly, it will  put  into  place  a  system  which  will  end  the
clogging up of our courts with traffic offences. Traffic offences will  only
go to court where the  seriousness  of  the  offence  so  requires,  or  for
certain other limited reasons, like  if  the  infringer  chooses  to  go  to
court.

Secondly, the Administrative  Adjudication  of  Road  Traffic  Offences  Act
provides for  the  establishment  of  a  road  traffic  infringement  agency
through which traffic offences will  be  administratively  adjudicated.  The
objectives of the agency are: to administer a procedure  to  discourage  the
contravention of road  traffic  law  and  to  support  the  adjudication  of
infringements; to enforce penalties  imposed  against  persons  contravening
road traffic laws; to provide specialised prosecution support services;  and
to undertake community  education  and  community  awareness  programmes  in
order to ensure that individuals understand their  rights,  obligations  and
options. Systems used in other countries to collect  fines  were  researched
before the South African AARTO was developed.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the
debt collecting agencies overseas achieve success rates in collecting  fines
of over 90%. The concept is so  successful  that  the  collection  of  other
outstanding debt is also done through such agencies.

Thirdly, the idea is not to make lots of  money  for  local,  provincial  or
national authorities or Government. The idea is  to  compel  road  users  to
stop violating the law. We have far too many  road  accidents  and  far  too
many people who die on our roads. We must and will intervene drastically  to
make our roads safer and reduce deaths on our roads. We can  do  it  and  we
will do it. That is the result  we  want  to  achieve.  Imposing  penalties,
including fines, is a means  to  achieve  that  objective.  If  we  reach  a
situation where there is voluntary law compliance and there is no  longer  a
need to impose fines, we will all celebrate. And I hope we  will  get  there
soon.

Fourthly, there will be proper record-keeping of previous traffic  offences.
That has not been the case until now. I think many of our hon  members  will
know from their own experiences that  each  traffic  offence  is  invariably
treated as a first offence. Each offender is treated as  a  first  offender.
That is going to come to an end.

Fifthly, the new system will help to eliminate fraud and corruption  because
of the way the administrative adjudication system will work.

Sixthly, currently there  are  great  disparities  in  fines  for  the  same
offence in different parts of the country, and sometimes even  in  the  same
court. The new system will help to promote  uniformity  with  the  necessary
flexibility where appropriate, because our courts do have a discretion  when
it comes to imposing fines where matters reach the courts.

Seventhly, the new system  will  penalise  drivers  and  operators  who  are
guilty of infringements through the imposition  of  demerit  points  leading
possibly to the suspension of licences and the  suspension  or  cancellation
of professional driving permits or operating permits. We have gone some  way
with a lot of preparation in laying the foundation  for  the  implementation
of the system. Of course, the imposition  of  these  demerit  points  is  in
addition to the fines which offenders have to pay.

Eighthly, the system will reward future law-abiding  behaviour  by  reducing
demerit points imposed on offenders if infringements  or  offences  are  not
committed over specified periods, in  other  words,  where  the  driver  has
changed his or her views. Should I also say ``her views''? But generally  it
is ``his''.

Ninthly, the system provides for reduced payments  where  there  is  timeous
compliance with notices and warnings.

Tenthly, AARTO will undertake community education  and  community  awareness
programmes  to  ensure  that  individuals  understand  their  rights,  their
obligations and options.

Eleventhly, the system will ensure that  serious  offences  are  dealt  with
effectively in our courts and that they  receive  the  necessary  attention.
They will produce the desired results by providing  specialised  prosecution
support services.

Why the amending Bill? I want to say, first of all, that the  discussion  on
the need for amendments within the Department  of  Transport  and  with  the
provincial governments has not delayed implementation.  The  need  for  such
amendments became evident in the  process  of  planning  implementation  and
doing the necessary preparatory work to introduce the new  system.  It  must
be remembered, as I indicated, that this  is  an  entirely  new  system  for
South Africa.

I want to  mention  a  few  important  elements  in  the  Bill.  Firstly,  a
definition was inserted  for  ``a  representations  officer''.  Secondly,  a
credit card driving licence will be acceptable identification. Thirdly,  the
amendment brings municipal laws within the ambit of the Act,  and  not  only
national and provincial  laws.  Fourthly,  at  an  institutional  level  the
number of persons serving on the board is increased from five to  seven  and
greater flexibility is created to appoint persons from both the  public  and
private sectors. Fifthly, the Bill makes provision for the  Minister,  after
consultation with the registrar, to make recommendations to the Minister  of
Justice for the appointment of sheriffs and deputy sheriffs  to  ensure  the
proper performance of the agency's functions. In  the  original  Act  it  is
only the registrar who made the recommendation.  Sixthly,  as  a  result  of
representations received, the period within which offenders must  pay  fines
is changed from 28 days to 32 days. Seventhly, the  provisions  relating  to
the attachment of property to pay  outstanding  fines  and  fees  have  been
clarified.

In conclusion, whilst the process of effecting the amendments  contained  in
the Bill is going on,  we  have  not  stopped  work  in  preparing  for  the
implementation of the AARTO Act. I am convinced  that  the  amendments  will
improve the law and will help to make the law  more  effective.  I  am  also
convinced that the implementation of AARTO will begin  a  new  era  in  road
behaviour in South Africa. Its  impact  may  not  be  immediate,  but  I  am
confident that it will be speedy.

Finally, I would like  to  thank  the  social  services  committee  and  its
chairperson for the consideration of the Bill  and  the  detailed  attention
which is normally given to my Bills, as has also happened in this  instance.
I say thank you to them and I look forward to  contributions  from  members.
[Applause.]

Nksz  P  C  P  MAJODINA:  Mhlali-ngaphambili,  lunga  lamalunga,   ozolileyo
nofikelelekayo uMphatiswa wezoThutho, amalungu eBhunga  leSizwe  lamaPhondo,
abathunywa abachongwe kumaphondo awo ukuze baze kuchophela le ngxoxo,  ndiya
bulisa egameni  loYise,  eloNyana  neloMoya  oyiNgcwele.  Ngawo  loo  magama
mathathu awenza iANC.

Ndithabatha inkxaxheba kule ngxoxo apho kuyilwa khona uMthetho  osisihlomelo
sokuqinisa ingalo yomthetho kwizohlwayo zolwaphulo mthetho ezindleleni.  Ewe
kambe ndithetha  ndiwuxhasa  lo  Mthetho  oYilwayo  kuba  unika  uRhulumente
igunya lokutshutshisa abaphuli mthetho ngokude bangenelwe nangunothimba.

Lo Mthetho oYilwayo uzama ukuncedana nabo abangathabathi ntweni ukuze  benze
amalungiselelo okuba bazihlawule  ngezavenge  izohlwayo  abazifumeneyo.  Loo
nto yenziwa nguRhulumente obakhatheleleyo nobaziyo abantu.

Lo Mthetho  oYilwayo  ukwa  qinisa  amandla  kuMphathiswa  wezoThutho  ukuze
achonge amalungu ebhodi abe  sixhenxe.  Abanini  zithuthi  baza  kunyanzelwa
ngulo Mthetho oYilwayo ukuba nabo bamkele izohlwayo ngesimo  seenqwelo  zabo
kuba  ngaphambili  bekusa  kunikwa  intlawulo  kulowo   ubhexesha   inqwelo,
ingeyiyo eyakhe. Umenzi mali asinde  yena  kuba  engabhexeshi  ngelo  xesha.
Uthi ke lo Mthetho oYilwayo "nanga amasi abekwe elangeni".  Ukuba  unenqwelo
kufuneka uqinisekise ukuba iziqhoboshi namavili  alungele  indlela.  Umqhubi
uyakugwetyelwa  okulingene  yena.  Asisayi  kudibana  nabaqhubi  beba   ngoo
``wazithwal izono Yesu Kristu''  ngelo  xesha  eseGetsemane.  Abenzi  bemali
bafumane imali kodwa abanye abantu behlupheka.

Kuya nyanzeleka ukuba  siyazise  le  Ndlu  okokuba  xa  ngaba  kukho  mqhubo
wenqwelo  okhoyo  apha  ophethe  iqwaku  qwaku  lelayisenisi  liya  phelelwa
ngomhla wama 28  kuFebruwari  ka  2000.  Emva  koko  asisayi  kuba  nalusini
ngomntu oqhuba engenalo ikhadi lokuqhuba ... Ndinalo  ke  mna  njengosihlalo
wale komiti yezothutho ... Kwaye ke  baza  kuthothoza  kwezimnyama  izisele.
Abo abaphula umthetho rhoqo de kube kumatyeli athile,  lo  Mthetho  oYilwayo
ugunyazisa  ukuba  siyithabathe  le  layisenisi  ngoba  akakwazi  kuziphatha
ezindleleni,  kwaye  ubeka  ubomi  bantu   esichengeni   ngenxa   yobuxelegu
bobuxaxavithi bakhe. Uza kohlwaywa ade ohlwaywe nangamanqin' enyathi.

Kukho isicelo, esiphuma kuluntu jikelele, sokuba eli sebe lakhe  uMphathiswa
maliphume iphulo lifundise  abantu  ngemithetho  epasileyo  yezothutho.  Eli
sebe malikhuphe namaphetshana acacisayo ngamalungelo ababhexeshi,  abakhweli
beenqwelo, abanini  zinqwelo  kunye  namagosa  ezendlela  ukuze  lo  Mthetho
oYilwayo ungasetyenziswa ngolunya nangobuxelegu  ukutshitshisa  abantu  kuba
umntu othile ekhupha  isixhiba.  Nabo  oomasipala  banoxanduva,  ke,  lokuba
bafakela imitshini yobuchwepheshe  ukuze  inxibelelane  nekazwelonke,  khon'
ukuze lowo othe wamosha eMpumalanga, athwayize,  aye  kungena  eFree  State,
aye  kungena  eMpuma  Koloni,  sibe  nokumbambele  wonke  lamatyala   alapha
elizweni.

Kodwa ke olo xanduva  olunikwa  oomasipala  luxanduva  olungakhange  lunikwe
nkxaso  ngokwemali.  Abakhumshileyo  bathi  ke   yi   ``unfunded   mandate''
andikhumshanga ke mna.
Kukho isicelo sokuba iibholorho zokukala  ubungakanani  nobunzima  bomthwalo
mazenziwe zibe kwindawo apho uninzi lwabantu  lusukela  khona,  khon'  ukuze
singaxhomekeki kwitikiti endleleni, kuba xa isithuthi sinomthwalo  ongaphaya
komlinganiselo size sifike sinikwe itikiti  siphinde  sihambe,  asibancedisi
abantu  abakhweleyo  apho  ngoba  basaya   kusweleka   ngokusindwa   kwesiya
sithuthi.

Le yingxoxo-mpikiswano yokugqibela ebandakanya  eli  Sebe  lezoThutho,  siza

[Ms P C P MAJODINA: Mr Chairperson, a kind person among  the  kind  ones,  a
peaceful and accessible Minister of Transport, members of the NCOP,  special
delegates appointed in their respective  provinces  to  take  part  in  this
debate, I greet you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy  Spirit.
It is those three words that constitute the ANC.

I am participating in this debate in which a Bill that is  an  amendment  is
created to strengthen the  laws  on  punishment  for  traffic  offences.  Of
course, I speak in support of this Bill, because  it  gives  Government  the
authority to prosecute offenders to the extent that assets may  be  even  be
seized.

This Bill attempts to help the poorest of  the  poor  to  be  able  to  make
arrangements for the payment of their fines in instalments.  That  is  being
done by a Government which cares for and knows the people.

This Bill strengthens  the  authority  of  the  Minister  to  appoint  seven
members to the board.  Vehicle  owners  are  also  going  to  be  compelled,
through this Bill, to take responsibility of  fines  for  the  condition  of
their vehicles, because previously drivers were fined even if they  did  not
own the vehicle. The one who profits goes unscathed because he was  not  the
driver at the time. This Bill says:  ``Let  us  see  now''.  If  you  own  a
vehicle, you must ensure that the  brakes  and  tyres  are  roadworthy.  The
driver is going to be punished for his own wrongdoing. We are not  going  to
find drivers taking the rap for owners, like Jesus in Gethsemane,  when  the
ones who make money are increasing their income, whilst others are poor.

It is imperative that we tell this House, if there is a driver here who  has
an old, useless licence, it has expired on 28 February 2000. After  that  we
are not going to be lenient on someone driving without a  card  licence  ...
[Interjections] ... as the Chairperson of this committee, I do have one  ...
and they are going to languish in dark cells. For those who  break  the  law
often and a few times, this  Bill  authorises  us  to  suspend  the  licence
because the owner cannot behave him or herself on the roads  and  place  the
lives of others at risk because of his or her recklessness. He or  she  will
be punished very severely.

There is a request from the general public that this department  embarks  on
a campaign to educate it on traffic laws passed. The department  must  issue
pamphlets that explain  the  rights  of  drivers,  passengers  in  vehicles,
vehicle owners as well as traffic officers so that this  Bill  is  not  used
maliciously and carelessly because some people  may  be  taking  revenge  in
prosecuting people.  Municipalities  also  have  an  obligation  to  acquire
technology in order to be linked to the  national  department,  so  that  an
individual who offends in Mpumalanga and wanders off to the  Free  State  or
the  Eastern  Cape  can  be  arrested  for  all  these  offences   committed
nationally.

However, that responsibility which is entrusted to  municipalities  has  not
been given financial support. Those who speak English  refer  to  it  as  an
``unfunded mandate''. I'm not good at speaking English.

There is a request that bridges for weighing the loads  on  vehicles  should
be constructed at places from which the majority  of  the  people  come,  so
that we do not rely on spot fines, because, if a vehicle with  a  load  that
is over the limit arrives and is  issued  with  a  spot  fine,  we  are  not
helping the people on board the vehicle, as they may still die as  a  result
of the vehicle not being able to carry the heavy load.

This is the last debate involving the Department of Transport. We are  going
to work in our respective home towns, we will be going  on  holiday.  It  is
imperative that we request drivers to drive to and arrive at home safely.

Lastly, I am saying to Minister: Let's stiffen the sentences  on  those  who
bribe and  the  ones  who  allow  themselves  to  be  bribed  on  the  road.
[Applause.]]

Dr P J C NEL: Madam Chairperson, as a result of the high  accident  rate  on
South African roads, road traffic safety is an issue of serious concern.

Road traffic management  comprises  many  functional  areas,  of  which  law
enforcement is one of the most important  functions.  The  effectiveness  of
law enforcement depends heavily on the successful  adjudication  of  traffic
offences. Unfortunately, at the moment there is a continuous downward  trend
in the finalisation of traffic offences, and  there  is  reason  to  believe
that the downward trend will continue in the future, resulting in  an  ever-
decreasing rate of successful  prosecution  of  traffic  offences.  It  will
appear as if, at the moment, the adjudication of  traffic  offences  is  not
the highest priority in the judicial system. There is also no proper record-
keeping of previous traffic offences.

To improve the current state of affairs, the Administrative Adjudication  of
Road Traffic Offences Act, better known as the  AARTO  Act  was  enacted  in
1998. The Act has  established  procedures  for  the  effective  and  prompt
adjudication of road traffic infringements. It also makes provision for  the
establishment of  the  road  traffic  infringement  agency  to  support  the
judicial  authorities  and  to   undertake   the   administration   of   the
adjudication process. The Act also provides for the imposition of  a  system
of a demerit points to penalise drivers and  operators  who  are  guilty  of
offences. If the proposed allowable number of 12 points is exceeded, it  may
result in the suspension and even the  cancellation  of  driver's  licences,
professional driving permits or operating permits.

Demerit points will be applicable to all traffic offences.  But  law-abiding
behaviour will also be rewarded as demerit points will  diminish  over  time
until they reach zero.

In order to implement the Act, it is now necessary to amend the Act for  the
second time. Some of the amendments  are  of  a  substantive  nature.  Most,
however, are only textual corrections. The hon  the  Minister  and  the  hon
chairperson of the Select Committee on Transport already mentioned  most  of
the more substantive amendments and I am not going repeat them.

I would like to conclude by saying that I realise  that  the  implementation
of the the AARTO system is a new concept for South Africans, and  that  some
individuals will find the intervention a  bit  too  drastic.  My  advise  to
those people is to go  to  one  of  the  casualty  departments  of  any  big
hospital near a highway on a  Saturday  night,  to  witness  the  mutilating
effect road accidents have on the bodies of  victims,  and  the  devastating
effect it has on the lives of families, and  the  sadness  in  the  eyes  of
those who have lost their loved ones. Those people will then surely  realise
that an environment must be created in which it would be too risky for  road
users not to abide by the traffic rules and not to pay their fines.

The NNP supports the Bill and wishes everybody in the  House  safe  journeys
during the festive season. Please arrive alive! [Applause.]

Ms  L  F  SHABALALA  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon
members, when I thought  about  this  Administrative  Adjudication  of  Road
Traffic Offences Amendment Bill, a critical question came  to  my  mind:  Is
the human being a beast? Does he or she need a  law  to  be  legislated  and
enforced in order to observe any rule? Surely, we really need this  amending
Bill.

In most cases when we refer to offenders we mean other  types  of  crime  by
unknown criminals.

Esiteshini somsakazo Ukhozi, namhlanje  ekuseni,  u-Alex  Mthiyane  uyichaze
kahle le nto ngenkathi ngilalele wathi: Lo mthetho uzochaphazela  hhayi  nje
abantukazana  kuphela  kodwa  izikhulu  zezinkampani  ezinkulu  nezintatheli
uqobo.   Uthe    uma    ungaqala    ukusebenza    namhlanje,    njengamanje,
bekungaphazamiseka nokusebenza ngisho nasemsakazweni.

Ngakho, ngiyavumelana nozakwethu ukuthi akube nohlelo  olunzulu  lokufundisa
umphakathi ngalo  mthetho  ngoba  akusho  ukuthi  abantukazana  nje  kuphela
abangazi ngawo kodwa ngisho nabo abasakazi uqobo  bayadinga  ukufundiswa  ze
nabo bafundise futhi khona emsakazweni. (Translation  of  isiZulu  paragrahs
follows.)

[This morning in the Ukhozi radio  station,  Alex  Mthiyane  explained  this
thing very well when I was tuning in. He said  this  Bill  will  affect  not
only ordinary people but also the big men and women  of  big  companies  and
even the journalists. He said if it can be implemented today, now,  the  way
the radio operates will be affected.

Therefore, I agree with  my  colleagues  that  there  should  be  a  serious
programme aimed at teaching the public about  this  legislation  because  it
does not mean that it is only the man in the street who does not  understand
it. Even the radio announcers need to be taught about it so  that  they  can
educate the public on the radio.]

Most drivers exceed the speed limit consciously and then await a  ticket  or
evade paying the fines. I believe that the demerit system  will  hit  a  raw
nerve. At my age I cannot  afford  to  go  back  and  sit  for  the  learner
driver's examination before going to a driving school.  Sengigugile.  [I  am
too old.] [Interjections.]

However, speeding and driving without a driver's licence cannot  be  defined
in isolation without associating this with the  danger  to  human  life  and
limb. We tend to count accidents by how many people get injured or die,  but
even just crashes are accidents. They need to  be  seriously  recognised  in
our road statistics.

Why, as South Africans, do we always think that we are in a  hurry?  Surely,
in a capitalistic world, our minutes and  hours  are  measured  against  the
rand, or the dollar, if one likes, from a taxi driver to a CEO  of  a  giant
conglomerate.  We  get  so  consumed  with  what  we  want  to  achieve  and
consolidate materially that we fail to strike a balance so that we think  of
the other person on the road as well.

Siyathinteka sonke ngoba abathandiweyo bethu  bayalimala  ezingozini  ngenxa
yobudedengu babanye abashayeli. [We are all affected because our loved  ones
get injured in the accidents that are caused by careless drivers.]

It is therefore logical that the demerit system will not  affect  the  poor,
individual truck driver who only takes orders but will directly  affect  the
registered owner of the trucking  company.  However,  we  have  a  challenge
regarding SADC truck drivers  who  will  not  be  affected  by  the  demerit
system, because overloading is very costly to our roads.

Sengiphetha,   ngikholwa   ukuthi   lo   ngumhlangano   wokugcina   enyakeni
sindawonye.  Ngifisa  sengathi  umyalezo  wokuphepha   ungavuseleleka   kula
maholidi  emphakathini  wonke  waseNingizimu  Afrika,  size  sibonane  futhi
ngonyaka ozayo.

Kulabo abazovakashela KwaZulu-Natali - ngicabanga  ukuthi  iningi  lamalungu
lizobe liKwaZulu-Natali -  ngifuna  ukubazisa  ukuthi  akukashintshi  lutho.
UmNyango kamphathiswa uComrade Sbu Ndebele usemi lapho  ekutheni:  Alufakwa,
lubuya nodaka! Angazi-ke ukuthi kutolikwa kuthiweni lokho ngesilungu.

Thina-ke,    njengesifundazwe    saKwaZulu-Natali,    siyahambisana     nalo
mThethosivivinywa  wokuchibiyela.   [Ihlombe.]   (Translation   of   isiZulu
paragraphs follows.)

[In conclusion, I hope that this is our last meeting for this year.  I  wish
the message of safety can be present during these public  holidays  for  all
South Africans, until we meet again next year.

To those who will visit KwaZulu-Natal, I think that most of the hon  members
will be in KwaZulu-Natal. I want to inform them that  nothing  has  changed.
The department of comrade Sbu Ndebele still insists on saying: It is  a  no-
go area! I do not know how to translate this into English.

We  in  the  province  of  KwaZulu-Natal,  supports  this   amending   Bill.
[Applause.]]

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  it  is  sheer
coincidence that the Administrative Adjudication of Road Offences  Amendment
Bill is introduced  in  this  House  on  the  eve  of  the  annual  December
holidays. As the ruling party, we are obviously  extremely  concerned  about
the safety of our road users, wherever they might  be  heading  during  this
period. We therefore consider it  important  to  remind  ourselves  and  the
public about the objectives of the Bill.

The effectiveness of law enforcement on  our  country's  roads  depends  on,
among other  things,  the  effectiveness  of  the  adjudication  of  traffic
offences. However, given the enormous case loads  of  our  judicial  system,
traffic offences do not exactly feature on the list  of  priorities  of  our
judicial system, hence the decline in the finalisation of traffic  offences.
This is of major  concern  to  all  of  us.  Nonetheless,  we  do  have  the
assurance and evidence from  the  national  Department  of  Transport  which
suggests the contrary.

Through the amendment to section 1 of the Act, offenders  could  have  their
cases tried not only in the courts but through a less expensive  and  faster
administrative system. It guarantees the offender the  constitutional  right
to have the case heard in a court of law if he or she so wishes and it  also
provides for a demerit point system. In terms of this  amendment,  offenders
can incur up to four demerit points for a single offence, depending  on  the
seriousness of that offence. The threshold of the  system  is  four  demerit
points. However, in the case of repeat offenders, a ceiling  of  12  demerit
points is determined,  after  which  offenders  could  have  their  driver's
licences,  permits  or  operator's  cards  suspended  if  they  exceed  this
ceiling.

Ngicabanga ukuthi, njengoba  umhlonishwa  uDullah  eshilo,  kuzanywa  ukuthi
kunqandwe  le  nto  yokuthi  kuthi  umuntu  ngenyanga  kaJanuwari  mhlawumbe
abanjelwe ukushayela edle amponjwana. Kuphinde ngenyanga elandelayo  abanjwe
futhi eshayela edle wona amponjwana  -  ngiyethemba  ukuthi  umhlonishwa  u-
Ackerman  ungilalele.  Uma  kunjalo,  kukhombisa  ukungawuhloniphi   kakhulu
umthetho lokho kuthi umuntu angahlale  ebanjelwa  into  eyodwa  ngaso  sonke
isikhathi.  Lowo  muntu  uzohlangabezana  nenkinga  yokwephucwa   ilayisense
njengoba  odadewethu  sebeshilo  futhi  nomhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe   eshilo.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[I think that, as hon Dullah has said, an attempt is being made  to  control
the habit that every time in  January  one  is  arrested  for  drinking  and
driving. And the following month the same person will be  arrested  for  the
same offence. I hope that hon Ackermann is  listening  to  me.  It  is  like
that, it means that there is a serious breaking of the law if  a  person  is
always arrested for the same offence. That person might face  a  problem  of
having his driver's licence taken  from  him  as  my  sisters  and  the  hon
Minister have said.]

This Bill will also make provision for offenders who display improvement  in
their conduct on the road. Demerit points get deducted after  a  three-month
offence-free period.

Lokho  kusambhanselo.  Kufana  nalokho   esasikubiza   ngombhanselo   thina.
Ngiyacabanga ukuthi  uRaju  uzokwazi  lokho.  Kodwa-ke  akasekho  umbhanselo
manje ngoba usashona. [That is a bonus. It is the same as something that  we
call a bonus. I think that Mr Raju will know that. But  there  is  no  bonus
now, it is dead.]

We are also encouraged that the Bill provides for  the  establishment  of  a
road traffic infringement agency  board.  This  agency  will  serve  as  the
Administrative  Adjudication  of  Road   Offences   Amendment   Bill's   key
implementation instrument. The agency board will ensure that the  agency  is
given capacity and expertise.

Section 12 of the Act is amended to empower the  Minister  to  recommend  to
the Minister for Justice and Constitutional  Development  that  sheriffs  or
deputy sheriffs be appointed in order to ensure proper  performance  of  the
agency. This includes the power to attach the property of defaulters.

Ngicabanga ukuthi kuzofuneka  nalokho  sikubeke  kakhulu  emiqondweni  yethu
ngoba akuyona into enhle  ukuthi  umuntu  athathelwe  izimpahla  zakhe  kade
eseziqoqe iminyaka eminingi  bese  kuthi  ngelanga  elilodwa  nje  zithathwe
ngoba ehluleka ukukhokhela amathikithi. (Translation  of  isiZulu  paragraph
follows.)

[I think that we should keep that deeply in our minds because it  is  not  a
good thing that a person has to lose his clothes after he has used them  for
years, and then one day those clothes are taken  from  him  because  he  has
failed to pay for his tickets.]
In conclusion, it is important to note that we are  not  dealing  with  road
offences exclusively, but also with sheer criminal mind-sets  and  generally
negative attitudes. We also believe  that  it  will  take  a  long  time  to
address the backlog of negative attitudes among a section  of  our  licensed
drivers. Licence suspensions, community  service  and  mandatory  retraining
for repeat traffic offenders will have a significant effect but it will  not
come overnight. Hopefully, through the Administrative Adjudication  of  Road
Offences Amendment Bill, Arrive Alive and other agencies we will be able  to
effect change in attitudes and behaviour.

The ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, hon Minister, special delegates and hon  members
who are here, overall the Department of Public Works,  Roads  and  Transport
in the Free State provincial government welcomes  and  appreciates  proposed
amendments to the Bill, because they will  assist  the  department  with  an
effective system of traffic management.

The Bill, through its  proposed  amendments,  will  assist  to  ensure  that
loopholes and weaknesses inherent in the principal Act  are  now  addressed.
For instance, it will ease the  burden  imposed  on  traffic  officers  who,
until this stage, have been forced to  fulfil  administrative  functions  in
most cases, as opposed to engaging in  traffic  management  and  their  core
functions. It has been a concern of the  department  that  traffic  officers
spend a great deal of time in courts, as opposed to on the roads where  they
are needed most.

On the provision of the road traffic  infringement  agency,  a  concern  was
that this would enable  an  infringer  to  be  accompanied  by  the  issuing
authority, but to refer the matter to an  agency  which  would  not  have  a
direct knowledge of  the  relevant  merits  of  the  case  brought  forward.
However, the amendment would  assist  with  the  accelerated  processing  of
fines, particularly minor fines, thus  reducing  the  burden  on  our  court
system, without  precluding  an  infringer  from  seeking  recourse  in  the
courts.

Some of the stakeholders' submissions raised concern about  the  high  costs
of traffic fines imposed on taxi operators,  which  would,  because  of  the
nature of the taxi industry, cause them effectively to go out of business.

The department indicated that the Free State  province,  compared  to  other
provinces, had  the  lowest  rate  of  traffic  fines  and  25%  of  revenue
generated by  the  department  arose  from  the  imposition  of  fines.  The
department is of the view that  a  point  must  be  acknowledged  that  some
discontent is based on the statistical evidence. South African  drivers  are
generally bad drivers who do not show respect for the laws of the road.

In many serious cases high traffic fines have been  used  as  deterrents  to
minimise serious road offences. However, indications are that in most  cases
they do not necessarily and effectively  deter  contravention.  Contraveners
in most cases get away with  murder  precisely  because  of  a  shortage  of
traffic personnel, as well as the problem alluded  to  of  traffic  officers
spending  a  great  deal  of  time  at  the  courts,   thus   leaving   road
infringements unattended to.

It has also come to our attention that traffic fines in  the  whole  of  the
province are not uniform because they are determined  in  various  municipal
magisterial districts. This is in keeping with  similar  moves  at  national
level.  In  this  regard   the   department   envisages   engaging   various
municipalities in the province.

The department also acknowledges the poor road infrastructure in some  parts
of the province and feels that it should not be  divorced  from  the  entire
object of bringing about good management, because it is true,  according  to
some  stakeholders,  that  poor  road  infrastructure  also  contributes  to
substandard conditions of the vehicles on  the  road,  and  it  particularly
affects the taxi operators who are the frequent road users.  Therefore,  the
department is committed to programmes, financially  and  otherwise,  towards
the improvement of the road infrastructure.

The demerit system  is  also  viewed  by  the  department  as  an  important
inclusion, through which we will close gaps. High fines are to  be  used  as
deterrents, and not only to be utilised as punitive measures, but  also,  as
is intended, to reinforce good behaviour on  our  roads  and  thus  to  help
change the attitude of many drivers on our roads.

It was further acknowledged that the demerit  system  requires  some  public
education - particularly in an industry such as  the  taxi  industry,  where
there is a great number of people who are not necessarily at ease  with  the
intricacies of the demerit system -  once  the  regulations  are  published.
Many of the traffic accidents and offences that occur in the Free State  are
caused by non-Free Staters as they pass  through  our  province.  Hence  the
national and provincial agencies  should  work  together  to  ensure  smooth
traffic  on  well-maintained  roads.  Defaulters  will  now  be  effectively
processed.

The Free State wishes to thank all members of the House for their  continued
support, co-operation and commitment. This has made us proud that  we  share
in these important efforts to provide a better life for all, especially  for
the marginalised. Therefore the Free State province endorses this  Bill  and
supports its passage. God bless you all! Be safe! We still need you  all  in
the House and in the country. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  special  delegates  and  hon
colleagues, it is always an honour to rise after the eloquent and  colourful
hon Rev Chabaku. I do so with thanks to the duty  whip  for  placing  me  to
follow after the hon Rev Chabaku.

The Bill seeks to amend the  Administrative  Adjudication  of  Road  Traffic
Offences Act so as to regulate the composition of the board; to provide  for
the appointment of sheriffs by the Minister for Justice  and  Constitutional
Development,  in  consultation  with  the  Minister  of  Transport;  and  to
prescribe an extended period  for  payment  of  infringement  fines,  making
representations and enforcing orders.

The amendments also ensure that  an  infringer  has  to  be  informed  in  a
prescribed manner if demerit points have been recorded against  his  or  her
name, and the prosecutor now has to notify  the  issuing  authority  of  the
reasons if he or she declines to prosecute. Infringers also have the  option
to pay the fines  in  one-off  payments  or  make  arrangements  to  pay  in
instalments, or go to court to finalise matters.

Any legislation proposed  to  bring  sanity  to  our  roads  and  safety  to
pedestrians and commuters is very welcome.  Yesterday's  headlines  screamed
that traffic offenders would be taken to the  cleaners  for  ignoring  fines
imposed, for treating  summonses  with  contempt,  etc.  The  likelihood  of
culprits losing vehicles and other property is indeed  a  savoury  prospect.
We welcome the Minister's plans to rid our roads of these vermin.

The pervasive  culture  of  noncompliance  must  be  met  head  on,  no  pun
intended. Road traffic violations are increasing in  geometric  progressing.
The culprits must be apprehended and sent to Coventry. There  should  be  no
place in our communities for irresponsible drivers  of  motor  vehicles  who
cause so much  pain,  sorrow  and  loss  of  income  to  victims  and  their
families, and as a result affect the  economy  of  our  country,  especially
when the victims happen to be able-bodied men and women who  become  victims
of horrible  accidents  caused  by  reckless,  dangerous  and  often  poorly
qualified drivers.

It is my pleasure to state that the DP supports  the  amendments  and  hence
the Administrative Adjudication of Road  Traffic  Offences  Amendment  Bill,
because we strongly believe that wrongdoers must  be  brought  to  book.  In
view of the encouraging remarks of the hon the Minister when  he  introduced
the debate, we are pleased to support the amendment. [Applause.]

filled with joy to hear that the delegate from the DP has  repented  and  is
co-operating with  all  other  people  who  support  the  Bill  that  brings
development to South Africa.]

An HON MEMBER: Impela! (Translation of Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[The law before us seeks to amend the Administrative  Adjudication  of  Road
Traffic Offences. I  want  to  state  that  we  in  Mpumalanga  support  the
amendments to this Act for the following reasons.  [Interjections.]  Yes,  I
will come back to you hon member. Firstly, it will make things easy for  the
administrators of the roads  to  refund  the  sheriffs  or  the  money  that
Government lost because there were no strong strategies to curb that.

Secondly, the regulation of the  appointment  of  sheriffs  will  scare  the
infringers and they, definitely, would be  frightened  not  to  pay  because
they would know that their belongings might be confiscated. You can  imagine
being a dignified father seated calmly at your own home,  watching  TV  with
your kids and, suddenly, a sheriff appears at your door  and  impounds  your
TV, just because you did not adhere to a certain  stop  sign  and  have  not
paid the fine too! [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Truly!

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL Kodvwa kubalulekile kutsi sisho, njengobe sike sabeka  nje
nasekomidini  kutsi  labo  bashayeli  betigulumba   nebemaloli   etinkampani
letitfolakala tingekho esimeni lesilungele kuhamba  emgwacweni,  emathikithi
enhlawulo  kuhle  abhalwe  ngelibito  lenkampani   nome   lemnikati   waleyo
nkampani. Ngaloko sivikela kutsi labo bashayeli, linyenti  labo  labaphuyile
bangatitfoli sebaphuye kakhulu, kumbe batitfole sebaboshiwe nome  sebadlelwe
timphahla ngalokungakafaneli.

Setsemba kutsi etehlakalweni letinjengaleti bashayeli  kufanele  bavikeleke.
Ngobe lawo maphutsa kusuke  kungesiwo  emaphutsa  abo  kodvwa  kungemaphutsa
aleto tinkampani nome banikati betigulumba.

Kuyatiwa  kutsi,  luswane  lolungakhali  lufela  embelekweni.  Kungako   nje
lomtsetfo uvumela kutsi labo labanetinkinga tekutsi  lenhlawulo,  bayikhokhe
kheshi,  kwangaleso  sikhatsi,  basengaya  kuyawuticelela  kutsi  bayikhokhe
ngemancozuncozu,  loku  lesitsi  ngemastolmenti.  Siphindze  futsi   sibonge
lokwengetwa kwemalanga layaye  abekwe  kutsiwe  umuntfu  kufanele  uyikhokhe
ngalelilanga  leli  kutsi  engetwe  kusukela  emalangeni   langema-28   kuye
kulangema-32. Ngobe loko kwenta kutsi lona wekunene  longawugcini  lomtsetfo
abe nelilanga linye emvakwekuphela kwenyanga kuze akhone kuyawukhokha.

Ngitawuphindza ngibuyele  kuloku  lokubekwe  yiNdvuna  lehloniphekile,  uMnu
Dullah Omar, loku lokubitwa ngekutsi ngema-demarikhi phoyinti  -  ngiphoceke
kakhulu   ngobe   lelibandla   lami   lebahumushi   belisengakatfoli   kutsi
emadimerikhi phoyinti singatsi  yini  ngeSiswati  -  kutsi  abukene  kakhulu
nebashayeli balapha eSikhwahlande - eNingizimu Afrika.

Ase sibuke kutsi bona labashayeli labavela ngaphandle kwaleli,  ikakhulukati
tsine lapha eMpumalanga  sakhelene  dvutane  neSwatini  kanye  neMozambikwe,
ubatfola balayishe tigulumba tabo tigcwele tinhlinhla  tidzimate  tibhembese
tibheke  etulu,  umangale  kutsi  ingabe  sihamba  kanjani.  Ngaleyo  ndlela
tihamba tigugubula lemigwaco yetfu.

Bona nome bangaboshwa kudzimate kube kasikhombisa  nome  kube  yimfica  kube
solo  kutsiwa  uboshwa  kwekucala  ngobe  le-dimerikhi  phoyinti  akaniketwa
umklomelo  wayo  kutsi  imehlise,  kucace   kutsi   ungumshayeli   loshayela
ngebudlabha. Kufanele kube nendlela labangayibukisisa ngayo bona  batiNdvuna
temigwaco bahlangane naletinye tindvuna kuleli lasentasi ne-Afrika, iSADC.

Siyawemukela  lomtsetfo  lapha  eMpumalanga  kutsi  awuciniswe,   uhambisane
nekuciniswa nekunakekelwa kwemigwaco, nekwakhiwa  kwemigwaco  ibe  sezingeni
lelifanele. Singatsi kubantfu bashayela kabi sibe tsine siyekelele  ngalapha
ngasekwakhiweni kwemigwaco  kugcwale  tigodzi  yonkhe  indzawo  ngobe  nguko
lokubangela  letingoti  letikhubata  lesicubulo   se-Arrive   Alive.   Sitsi
imigwaco ayinakekelwe, ikhone kutsi ikhushulwe  ibe  sezingeni  leliphakeme.
Asisho-ke ngaloko kutsi  akwandziswe  linani  lema-tholigethi  ngobe  libese
lidla kakhulu ekhikhini. [Luhleko.]

Sihlalo wetfu wekomidi, Make Majodini, abesabekile kutsi kutaba kuhle  kutsi
kube nemfundziso lenyenti  kakhulu  kubashayeli,  kodvwa  akufundziswe  nabo
laba  labatiphatsimandla   temigwaco   ngalomtsetfo   lomusha   kuze   kutsi
nakwenteka baphume bayewusebenta bati  kutsi  abasasebenti  ngalowa  mtsetfo
lomdzala waboPewula. [Kuhlaba lulwimi.]

Ekugcineni,  kubalulekile  kakhulu  kutsi  leNdlu  yati  kutsi   iMpumalanga
iyakusekela kushicilelwa kwalomtsetfo.  [Tandla.]  (Translation  of  Siswati
paragraphs follows.)

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Chairperson, it is very important that we  state,  as  we
have said in the committee, that for those drivers of company  tractors  and
lorries, which are unroadworthy, the tickets for fines  must  be  issued  to
the company or to the owner of that company. By so doing we  are  protecting
those drivers, many of whom are very poor that they do not  find  themselves
in a poorer state, or find themselves in  jail  or  their  properties  being
unfairly confiscated.

We hope that in such disasters drivers should be  protected,  because  those
are not, usually, the  mistakes  of  the  drivers,  but  mistakes  of  their
companies or owners of the tractors and lorries.

It is a known fact that a baby who does not cry dies on its  mother's  back.
That is why this Bill allows that those who  have  problems  in  paying  the
fine in cash, there and then,  can  go  to  ask  permission  to  pay  it  in
instalments. We are also grateful that the usually stipulated  timeframe  to
pay has been increased from 28 days to 32. That allows  that  a  person  who
does not adhere to the law would have  another  day  after  month-end  which
would enable him or her to go and pay the fine.

I will come back to what the hon Minister, Dullah Omar, said  about  demerit
points - I am very much disappointed because my Language Board has  not  yet
coined the official name for demerit points in Siswati - it is because  they
are looking directly to the South African drivers only.

Let us turn to the drivers that are not South  Africans,  especially  we  in
Mpumalanga; we are faced with drivers from both  Swaziland  and  Mozambique.
You find that those people have loaded tractors full  to  capacity  so  that
one sees the load is overweight and begins to wonder how it manages  to  get
moving anyway. In that way they destroy our roads.

Even though they could be charged more than seven times or  nine  times,  it
is always said it is for the first time they are fined because they are  not
given the demerit points to degrade them, and it is clear that he or she  is
a bad driver. There should be strategic measures that they as  Ministers  of
transport and other ministers in the Southern part of Africa, could apply.

We  in  the  Mpumalanga  provinces  support  that  this   Bill   should   be
strengthened, together with the durability, catering  and  building  of  the
roads so that they comply with  the  acceptable  standards.  We  should  not
accuse people of bad driving while we are relaxed and not building   durable
roads, and let potholes develop all over the roads because that  is  one  of
the causes of accidents that impede on the Arrive Alive slogan.

All we are trying to say is that roads should be given first priority;  road
standards should be raised to the highest level. By so  saying  we  are  not
asking for more toll-gates because it is biting deep into our pockets.

The Chairperson of our committee, Ms Majodina, has already  stated  that  it
would be fitting to have extensive training for the  drivers  and  that  the
administrators of the roads, according to this  new  Bill,  should  also  be
taught so that if it happens that they should go out  to  work  they  should
know  that  they  are   no   longer   working   like   in   ancient   times.
[Interjections.]

Lastly, it is  imperative  that  this  House  should  know  that  Mpumalanga
supports the amendment of this law. [Applause.]]

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, if one looks  at  the
statistics, on average there are 512 000 motor vehicle accidents a  year  in
our country. In order to combat the generally irresponsible driving  habits,
institutional  reform  has  become  necessary,  because  of   the   worrying
downwards trend in the finalisation of road traffic offences. We  hope  that
with the Administrative Adjudication  of  Road  Traffic  Offences  Amendment
Bill this and associated problems will now be speedily addressed.
A closer look at the  statistics,  specifically  those  pertaining  to  spot
fines, tells us why. In terms of the  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  spot  fines
have dropped dramatically from 75% in 1989,  to  a  pathetic  25%  in  1997.
Summonses with the option of a fine have dropped from 72% in  1989,  to  51%
in 1997. Summonses to appear in court are down from 71% in 1989, to  25%  in
1997. Unfortunately, 1997 is the last year for which comprehensive data  are
available.

The aims  of  the  Administrative  Adjudication  of  Road  Traffic  Offences
Amendment Bill are simply to  put  in  place  an  effective,  efficient  and
streamlined fine processing and collection system  that  will  take  routine
traffic offences out of the overstretched courts.  This  we  welcome,  since
offenders of traffic  violent  and  nonviolent  offences  are  causing  huge
bottlenecks at our courts.

The Bill also seeks to do away with anomalies and deferring fines  that  are
currently open to abuse. Moreover, it eliminates on-the-spot bargaining  and
provides for standard national penalties for specified  offences.  So  there
can be no bargaining about it.

The Bill introduces the demerit point system in respect of  certain  traffic
offences, such as speeding, overloading, unroadworthy vehicles  and  driving
without a valid driver's licence.  There  is  a  threshold  on  the  demerit
points a first offender incurs, depending on the severity  of  the  offence.
When  an  offender  exceeds  12  demerit   points,   a   driver's   licence,
professional driving permit or operator's card will be  suspended.  A  third
suspension will result in the suspension of the licence.

However, it also provides for the  reduction  of  demerit  points  for  good
behaviour for  drivers  and  consistent  law  compliance.  In  other  words,
drivers will not be stuck at 12 demerit points for ever.

More importantly, though, the  system  depends  on  an  integrated  national
information database or similar mechanism to  expose  repeat  offenders  and
banish them from  the  roads.  Expectations  for  delivery  and  proper  law
enforcement on our roads are high. It is therefore important  that  we  have
an integrated national database or similar mechanism to crack  down  on  and
banish repeat offenders from our roads, because  road  user  attitudes  will
not change overnight.

In addition, we  need  to  involve  communities  and  participation  by  our
youngest schoolchildren in order to ensure sustained responsibility  on  our
roads, because in the final analysis they are the victims  of  irresponsible
driving  habits.  Ultimately,   all   stakeholders,   such   as   provincial
departments,  local  governments,  taxi  associations,  fleet  owners,   bus
operators and programmes such as Arrive Alive and the Road to South  African
Safety need to come on board  to  nurture  different  attitudes  and  social
behaviours towards road behaviour.

Tshipo o rile ke lebelo, motlhaba wa re  ke  namile.  Letsogo  la  molao  le

(Translation of Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[One can run, but cannot hide. No matter how long it  takes,  the  law  will
catch up with wrongdoers. There are people who want  to  do  things  in  the
dark. Even if they were to do things in the dark, they will be seen.

Public servants in the streets of South Africa will have to work  harder  so
that this law could filter down in South Africa. One who avoids danger  does
not find himself in trouble. The North West province says that  a  thief  is
often caught with what he has stolen.  This  law  should  be  concluded  and
upheld.]
Mnr A J WILLIAMS (Wes-Kaap): Mev die  Voorsitter,  die  Wysigingswetsontwerp
op die Administratiewe Beregtiging van  Padverkeersmisdrywe  van  2002  word
deur die Wes-Kaap ondersteun. Die implementering van hierdie  wetgewing  kom
al  'n  lang  pad  aan.  Die  vertroue  word  ook  uitgespreek  dat  hierdie
wetsontwerp alle verkeersoortreders aan  die  kaak  sal  stel,  ook  daardie
enkele verkeersbeamptes wat  hulle  skuldig  maak  aan  die  oortreding  van
verkeersreëls. Ek verwys na daardie verkeersbeamptes wat daarna  probeer  om
getuienis  so  te  manipuleer  dat  hulle  hul  onskuld  kan  bewys  en  die
instrumente die skuldiges maak.

Dit is noodsaaklik dat daar orde op ons paaie moet kom.  Daar  is  'n  soort
astrante arrogansie op ons paaie te bespeur. Bestuurders  van  voertuie  gee
net nie meer om nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A J WILLIAMS  (Western  Cape):  Madam  Chairperson,  the  Administrative
Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Amendment Bill of  2002  is  supported
by the Western Cape. The implementation of this legislation has been a  long
time coming. The hope is also expressed  that  this  Bill  will  expose  all
traffic violators, including those few traffic officials who are  guilty  of
violating traffic rules. I am referring to those traffic officials  who  try
to manipulate evidence afterwards so that they  can  prove  their  innocence
and make the instruments the guilty parties.

It is essential that order be established on our roads. There is a  kind  of
insolent arrogance visible on our roads. Drivers of vehicles simply  do  not
care anymore.]

Not only will this Bill  therefore  succeed  in  decriminalising  many  road
traffic offences and so enable our courts of  law  to  concentrate  on  more
serious criminal acts, but it  will  enable  authorities  to  follow  up  on
offenders more effectively. It will seek, through regulations, to  establish
uniform penalties for the same offences wherever they take  place  in  South
Africa and with its demerit points system encourage drivers to be  more  law
abiding.
Most members will be familiar with the  intentions  of  this  Bill  and  the
modus operandi of the board that is  to  be  created  and  the  infringement
agency that will manage the processes. An infringement agency  will  operate
under the guidance of a board. Law enforcement authorities  will  issue  the
notices to technical law infringers in the normal way. If the  fine  is  not
paid to the authority within 32 days, the case will be handed  over  to  the
agency to follow up, first with courtesy letters  and  later  with  stronger
measures. The cost of each action will be recouped  from  infringers  unless
they are, through appeals through the agency or a court of  law,  found  not
guilty. The penalty fines  eventually  gathered  by  the  agencies  will  be
returned to the issuing authorities less a handling fee.

Regulations will be promulgated setting uniform  penalties,  both  in  fines
and merit points, for each particular offence. The agency  will  be  peopled
by knowledgeable and experienced  persons  who  will  be  properly  able  to
adjudicate appeals.

As to demerit points, when these accumulate to a maximum number  of  twelve,
the habitual offender's driver's licence is automatically suspended.

Dit is reg so. As 'n man dan nie wil hoor nie, moet hy voel. [Gelag.] En  as
hy nie kan voel nie, moet daar na ander maatreëls  gekyk  word  om  hom  tot
orde te roep. [That is quite right. He who will not listen must be  made  to
feel. [Laughter.] And if he cannot feel, other measures must  be  looked  at
to call him to order.]

Through the adoption of this Bill it is envisaged  to  make  some  practical
adjustments, such as the requirement for information to  be  shared  between
enforcement agencies and a central data  base,  including  municipal  bylaws
and regulations, in the sphere of the agency's activities.  The  composition
of the control board and competencies of  board  members  will  be  amended,
while a number of potential loopholes that have come to light will  also  be
closed.

In clause 1 the  regulation  of  the  driving  licence  card  as  acceptable
identification is dealt with. Our card-type licence is of high  quality  and
has a number of recognition factors built into it. Further it  is  also  the
intention to wait until all drivers  have  converted  to  the  card  licence
before the demerit point system that is part of  the  Bill  will  come  into
action.

Daarom is dit noodsaaklik dat ons 'n beroep doen  op  alle  bestuurders  wat
nog nie in besit  is  van  daardie  kaartlisensie  nie  om  dit  so  spoedig
moontlik te bekom. [Therefore it is essential that we appeal to all  drivers
who are not yet in possession of that card-type  licence  to  obtain  it  as
soon as possible.]

Clause 2 takes cognisance of the need for compliance  with  municipal  laws.
Previously only national and provincial legislation was mentioned.

Clause 4 raises from three to five the number of experts that can  serve  on
the board. In total there will be seven members. They no longer have  to  be
state employees and there is a stronger requirement for  the  invitation  of
objections to the proposed appointment of individuals.

Clause  6  obliges  the  national  Minister  of  Transport  to  consult  the
registrar before making recommendations  for  the  appointment  of  sheriffs
through the Minister of Justice.

Clause 8 introduces a period of 32 instead  of  28  days  during  which  the
discount of a penalty will apply and during which arrangements may  be  made
without agency enforcement coming into force. Various  other  loopholes  are
closed. A local registration authority and driving  licence  testing  centre
are added where transactions may occur and there is an obligation placed  on
them to update the national contravention register appropriately.

In clause 13 the registrars have been strengthened in that a  warrant  issue
is valid until overtaken by a sheriff's action and  there  is  clarification
that he/she only may seize movable property to defer penalty fees.
Clause 15 deals with the  dates  when  demerit  points  are  incurred,  with
partial payments and with the notification by the clerk of the court to  the
agency of the results  of  prosecutions  and  appeals,  which  is  obviously
important.

Clause 16 adds necessary  detail  to  the  commencement  of  demerit  points
towards disqualification or surrender of a licence. As to the  remainder  of
the clauses, they clarify matters, eliminate gaps or deal  with  appropriate
actions. Once this Bill is passed into law the then  substantive  AARTO  Act
will prove a boon to traffic law enforcement and traffic management  in  all
spheres of government. [Time expired.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, I think members should  realise  that  today  I
speak on behalf of my province, not the UDM. I would like to recognise  this
gesture with great appreciation. But this observation need not be  construed
to  suggest  anything  connected  to  the  crossing-the-floor   legislation.
[Laughter.]

On a serious note, I would  from  the  outset  like  to  indicate  that  the
permanent delegates from the Limpopo province have  diligently  briefed  the
Standing  Committee  on  Transport  on  two  separate  occasions.  Extensive
discussions took place during the briefing. The interrogation  of  the  Bill
was done clause by clause under the able leadership of the hon  Kgoshi  M  L
Mokoena.

Subsequent to this exercise, the permanent delegation was granted a  mandate
in terms of the provincial  legislature  Resolution  32,  dated  5  November
2002, to vote in favour of the Bill with no amendments.  This  position  was
expressed as well in the select committee during our tabling  of  the  final
mandate. During the interrogation of the Bill by the joint  meeting  of  the
permanent delegates and the  Standing  Committee  on  Transport,  amendments
effected in the Bill were hailed on account  of,  among  other  things,  the
socioeconomic status of the province.

Unemployment and the  poverty  profile  of  our  province  will  undoubtedly
maximise a lot, particularly with regard to  the  new  payment  arrangements
proposed  by  this  Bill.  The  settlement  of  the  infringement  fines  in
instalment terms, and that discounts could be effected upon  payment  within
a scheduled period, namely 32 days, are therefore viable proposals.

On matters pertaining  to  the  composition  of  the  board,  the  principal
legislation had provided that the board would comprise  seven  members,  and
that five of these members should not be  public  servants.  This  provision
could no longer stand the  test  of  time  given  that  section  22  of  our
Constitution provides that every citizen  has  the  right  to  choose  their
trade, occupation or profession freely. Therefore it  cannot  be  ruled  out
that there were specific people destined to benefit from this arrangement.

Further, I wish to highlight the following in terms of section  21  of  this
Bill. A person may ascertain whether he or she has demerit points  from  the
licensing office upon the payment of the prescribed fees. This process  will
trigger a regular and sustained process  of  interaction  between  officials
and traffic offence perpetrators. Counselling of offenders is bound to  stem
from this interaction. Another point is that point-scoring will  undoubtedly
impact positively on the imposition of appropriate sentences by  our  courts
of law.

Perhaps the most important development could be that  demerit  points  would
serve as deterrent instruments against the habitual perpetrators of  traffic
offences. We should remember that our downtimes could be used  to  build  us
up. Put differently, a maxim has it that a burned child threads fire.

May  I  therefore  conclude  by  putting  it  on  record  that  the  Limpopo
provincial government is in agreement with all the amendments  effected.  We
look  forward  to  the  positive  outcomes  envisaged  by  this   piece   of
legislation.

Nksz N D NTWANAMBI: Mhlalingaphambili, eyona nto imnandi  kukuthetha  abantu
abaninzi sele bethethile. Loo nto inceda naba bantu banexhala lexesha.
Ndifuna ukuthi kumphathiswa ... (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Ms N  D  NTWANAMBI:  Chairperson,  it  is  most  satsifying  to  follow  on
everybody else. It is also helpful to the people who keep tabs on the time.

I want to say to the Minister ...]

... the Bill that is before us today will help us catch those  who  fail  to
comply with the law.  Nothing  can  substitute  the  driver's  licence.  One
cannot be asked for a driver's  licence  and  produce  a  credit  card.  The
sooner the amendments are incorporated into the Act,  the  better  for  both
most tourists and pedestrians.

Clause 2 of the Bill provides for what has always been the  desire  of  many
people, that all spheres of government work together. I do not  have  to  go
back to the boards and the sheriffs. That has been mentioned already,  so  I
do not have to repeat that, but I must also  say  that  many  municipalities
are owed millions of rands. Some of the culprits, I can assure hon  members,
are seated here. [Interjections.]

Into ethetha ukuba ndiwuchanile umhlola. Ngabo  ke  aba  babamba  oomasipala
imali. [This means I have hit the nail on the head.  These  are  the  people
who owe money to municipalities.]

If one does not pay, this time one will be forced to  pay.  [Interjections.]
Whoever is accusing me is not telling the truth.

The fact that the sheriff can now attach and remove goods, as  hon  Windvoël
was saying, and sell them to the value of the fine, will leave  many  people
with one message: Abide by and follow the rules,  or  lose  what  you  have.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.]

Well, fortunately, nothing says one will be cut, so no blood will flow.

The ANC supports the Bill. Lastly, let me just say this ...

... abantu abahlala elokishini baza kuzibona ezi zithuthi zingaqhelekanga  -
phaya eGuguletu  sizibiza  ngokuba  ngamaphela  -  ezithutha  abantu.  Ubani
wofika  iziqhoboshi  zazo   zingasebenzi,   ngathi   zizithuthi   ezithathwe
ezindongeni. Azifani nje nezindlu,  ngamatyotyombe  ahambayo,  agoso.  Kodwa
into ebalulekileyo kukuba kuzo zonke ezi  zinto  zazo  zingaqhelekanga,  ezi
zithuthi zithwala imiphefumlo yabantu.

Ndifuna ukuthi bendingavuya xa nabakhweli aba bebenganikwa  awabo  amatikiti
ngokukhwela ezi zithuthi bebona ukuba imiphefumlo  yabo  isengozini.  Ixesha
lifikile lokuba nathi sifunde ukuzenzela. Asizenzeli yonke into.

Kwakhona,  ibingaba  luvuyo  kum  ukuba  amagosa  endlela   ebenokukhe   abe
nenkampu, ngakumbi ngeli xesha likaDisemba, kule ndlela ibheka  e-Laingsburg
naseBhobhofolo, ubani angaboni nje imingqandandana,  mhlawumbi  elinye  apha
kule ndlela yokuqala xa ubani ephuma eKapa ze elinye afike lingaphaya ngase-
Three Sisters. Ayikho indlela ebulala abantu ukudlula le.

Okokogqibela,  kwabo   baza   kuza   enkomfeni   eStellenbosch   ngoDisemba,
kubalulekile  ukuba  njengabantu  abaziwa  njengabaqhubi  abathanda  isantya
esiphezulu nabaqhuba  izithuthi  ezivumayo,  kufuneka  bawalungise  amavili.
Kodwa  okona  kubalulekileyo  kukuba  kufuneka  baqhube   ngenyameko,   babe
ngumzekelo. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[... people from the location see these unusual vehicles - in Guguletu  they
call them ``cockroaches'' - which transport people from point A to point  B.
One will find them with defective brakes, as if  they  were  collected  from
the scrapyard. One would not liken them to houses;  they  are  like  crooked
shacks on wheels. But what is of  importance  is  that,  despite  all  their
abnormalities, these vehicles transport people.

I want to say that I would be happy if the  commuters  themselves  could  be
ticketed for using these vehicles, knowing full well that they  are  putting
their lives in danger. The time has come for us to learn  to  do  things  on
our own. We do not do everything on our own.

Furthermore, I would be  happy  if  traffic  officers  could  set  up  camp,
particularly during the December season, on the road leading  to  Laingsburg
and Beaufort West, so that one doesn't just see a  few;  maybe  one  on  the
roads leading out of Cape Town and maybe another  one  in  the  vicinity  of
Three Sisters. That road has the most fatal accidents.

Finally, those who will be attending  the  conference  at  Stellenbosch,  as
people who are known to be fond of speeding and driving  good  cars.  It  is
important  that  they  check  the  wheels  of  their  cars.  But  even  more
important, they have to be patient on the road and be exemplary.]

They must also know that speed kills. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, hon members and  special  delegates,
I first want to thank all members who participated in this debate.  I  thank
them for their support for the amendments of  the  Bill  and  also  for  the
encouragement. I have noted  the  suggestions  which  have  been  made  with
regard to a number of practical matters and  members  can  be  assured  that
these will be put before the relevant structures.

I can say to the House that we did not come  to  Parliament  without  having
consulted all the provinces. In other  words,  this  amending  Bill  is  the
product of consultations between national  and  provincial  governments,  as
well as Salga representing local government, so  that  what  we  have  is  a
product of consultation between the different levels of  government.  And  I
am very happy to note here today that the consensus on the Bill  is  a  fair
reflection of what our own discussions have been.

I am not going to comment on all the points which have  been  raised  during
the course of this debate. I think many of  them  are  suggestions,  support
for the Bill and explaining the Bill, so there is no need for me  to  repeat
them or to comment on them.

I just want to highlight one or two things. The first is  that  hon  members
and delegates were concerned  about  whether  the  public  was  sufficiently
informed and whether the public was going to  be  sufficiently  educated.  I
want to give the House the assurance that there is a programme in  place  to
ensure that in all provinces there are programmes, so as to put  before  the
public all information relating  to  this  law  and  how  it  will  operate.
Educating the public, and educating the motoring public, is going to  be  an
important feature of the work of AARTO.

Secondly, I have  noted  the  requests  that  not  only  drivers  should  be
penalised for certain traffic offences, but also owners. I want to give  the
House the assurance that that is  an  area  that  the  department  has  been
looking into. The chairperson will recall that just  about  a  year  ago  we
launched the Road to Safety Strategy, of which Arrive Alive is a  part.  One
of the  issues  was  related  to  overloading.  There  the  issue  of  owner
responsibility and liability came up. On 21 November there will be a report-
back conference on what we have done  under  the  Road  to  Safety  Strategy
since the strategy was launched in November last year. This would be one  of
the issues which will be reported on.

I also want to indicate to the House that we are not bringing  in  this  law
in isolation. It is part of this broader strategy to deal with road  traffic
management - not only road safety, but road traffic management. Road  safety
is  an  important  part  of  road  traffic  management,  but  road   traffic
management is a broader concept. And so there will be a report-back  at  the
conference on the 21st on all aspects of road traffic management.

An example which is relevant for us is the issue  of  professional  drivers,
drivers of taxis, buses and of trucks. Just over a week  ago  there  was  an
accident near Piet Retief involving a vehicle carrying tourists. Ten  people
were killed in the accident. Now here was a professional driver. The  police
have not decided whether to prosecute or not.  It  is  possible  that  there
will be a prosecution and it is possible that  the  driver  may  be  charged
with culpable homicide. But the  indications  are  that  the  cause  of  the
accident was driver fault. And if one looks at the number of bus  accidents,
minibus taxi accidents,  as  well  as  motor  car  accidents,  driver  fault
appears to be the major contributing cause to road accidents  and  therefore
to the deaths which we have on our roads.

With regard to  professional  drivers,  looking  at  the  system,  including
AARTO, we have proposed that there should be a requirement in the  law  that
no person shall acquire a professional driver's permit unless he or she  has
passed  a  course  in  professional  driver  training.   In   other   words,
professional driver training, we propose, should be made compulsory,  and  I
believe that all stakeholders are  generally  in  agreement  with  that.  So
there are a number of other measures which are being brought in.  I  am  not
going to go into more details; I am merely giving one  or  two  examples  in
this regard.

More than one member raised the question of the condition of our roads,  and
I believe that early in the new year we should come back to  the  House  and
give the House a report on what is  being  done  on  the  question  of  road
development and maintenance in South Africa. I can say to the House that  we
are working on a road development plan. Earlier this year we announced  that
Treasury was making available, over a period of five  years,  an  amount  of
R30 billion for road development and maintenance in  South  Africa.  Now  of
course that is not just for national roads, but for provincial roads,  local
roads and rural roads. One of the proposals is that the money set aside  for
rural roads should be ringfenced so that that money should not be  used  for
any other purpose. My  own  view  is  that  all  money  allocated  for  road
building and road maintenance should be ringfenced and different  levels  of
government should not be allowed to use that money for  any  other  purpose.
We are finalising the road development plan and I am sure that early in  the
new year we will be able to give a further report  to  this  House  in  this
regard.

I want to say that we are moving on a number of fronts and the  question  of
roads, vehicle fitness, driver  fitness,  law  enforcement,  and  of  course
AARTO is going to play a very important role in that. May  I  then  conclude
by saying that the Arrive Alive campaign this year is also  going  to  be  a
very  intensive  one.  Again,  there  has  been  consultation  between   the
different provinces. The provinces actually play the biggest role in  Arrive
Alive and the local authorities as well, but the big focus this year  is  on
pedestrian safety, and there will be a great deal of  communication  on  the
question of pedestrian safety.  About  30%  of  road  deaths  are  those  of
pedestrians, and therefore it is going to form  an  important  part  of  the
campaign. And, as hon members have said, we need to set the example. I  hope
that members of this House and the National Assembly will set an example.  I
want to conclude by thanking the House  for  its  support  and  wishing  all
members a happy holiday and  festive  season.  May  you  all  arrive  alive.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                    LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                      (Consideration of Report thereon)

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Madam Chair, hon  members,
in the past and at various times this  House  has  considered  a  series  of
legislation which helped us shape and inaugurate what is regarded as one  of
the most innovative systems of local government  in  the  world.  Since  its
inauguration just under two years ago, our new system  of  local  government
has announced and made its presence felt in several profound ways.

Whereas many South Africans - especially those who are  on  the  peripheries
of urban centres and those in the rural areas - previously  experienced  the
state as an institution that sought their political and economic  exclusion,
we now have a system of  local  government  which  is  truly  inclusive  and
nationwide. It is nationwide in the sense that in every  local  area  people
have had the opportunity to elect their own  public  representatives.  Also,
the local government system is part of our overall intergovernmental  system
which functions in  pursuit  of  our  national  goals,  the  goals  of  good
governance and sustainable economic development.

The notion of integrated development  planning  is  increasing  in  relation
with all our municipalities having participated  in  the  novel  process  of
formulating integrated development  plans.  The  development  plans  are  of
varying quality and this points to their differential legacy  of  endowment,
which  we  must  redress  through  the  intensified  implementation  of  our
national programme of support for local government.

As we continue to give systematic  support  to  local  government,  we  need
continually to look at our policy and legislative environment. In the  event
where we identify bottlenecks or impediments which stand in the way  of  the
realisation of our strategic objectives, we are dutybound to  approach  this
House, as we are now doing, for assistance.

We introduce to the House today the Local Government  Laws  Amendment  Bill.
The Bill seeks further to refine the legal  framework  applicable  to  local
government. To this end,  the  Bill  seeks  to  amend  the  Organised  Local
Government Act of 1997, the Remuneration of Public  Office  Bearers  Act  of
1998, the Local Government Municipal Demarcation  Act  of  1998,  the  Local
Government Municipal Structures Act of 1998, the Local Government  Municipal
Systems Act of 2000 and the Local Government Municipal Structures  Amendment
Act of 2000.

The Bill is intended to address the anomalies in the current legislation  in
order to create certainty. A number of these amendments are of  a  technical
nature, whilst the rest of  the  amendments  seek  to  clarify  and  restate
policy. We are prompted to do this by the  exigencies  which  have  come  to
light in the process of the implementation of existing legislation.

For instance, in the course of doing our work, we saw the  necessity  for  a
provision which regulates the implementation of the division of  powers  and
functions between category B and C municipalities. An amendment  of  section
84(3)  of  the  Local  Government  Municipal  Structures  Act  is  proposed,
enabling us to regulate the legal, practical and other consequences  when  a
notice authorising a local municipality  to  perform  certain  functions  or
exercise certain powers of district municipalities is revoked.

Currently  no  provision  pertaining  to  such  regulation  of  consequences
exists.  An  amendment  is  proposed  to  the  Local  Government   Municipal
Structures Amendment Act, 2000, so as  to  extend  the  transitional  period
provided  therein  until  June  2003.  This  amendment  will   ensure   that
authorisation for municipal powers and  functions  will  not  lapse  in  the
middle of the municipal financial year, as would be the case at the  moment.
The implementation of the final division of powers and  functions  will  lay
the foundation  for  strong  district  councils.  It  will  enable  district
councils to focus on the sustainable delivery of services in  an  integrated
and co-ordinated manner.

The Municipal Demarcation Board has  requested  various  amendments  to  the
Local Government Municipal Demarcation Act of 1998. Most of  the  amendments
proposed are of  a  technical  nature  so  as  either  to  correct  outdated
references or to clarify matters of process or interpretation.

The proposed  amendments  that  introduce  new  principles  into  the  Local
Government Municipal Demarcation Act include an amendment to section 6  that
would reduce the number of  members  of  the  Municipal  Demarcation  Board.
Whilst the board will continue to exist, it is expected that it  would  only
need a  limited  number  of  members  to  perform  its  functions.  A  board
consisting of a minimum of seven and a maximum of ten members is proposed.

The Bill provides for municipalities to reimburse  traditional  leaders  for
any such expenses as they may incur when they participate in the affairs  of
municipal councils. This is in response to representations made  by  various
role-players in pursuit of enhancing the objective  of  traditional  leaders
in local governance.

This is another  concession  Government  is  making  to  ensure  that  these
leaders become an integral part of the system of rural governance  at  local
level. It is the intention of this legislation  to  assist  in  facilitating
the smooth implementation of our new local  government  system.  To  achieve
this goal a number of obstacles on the  road  to  a  transformed  system  of
local government must be removed. To this end I commend  this  Bill  to  the
House. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  members,  our  democratic
Government has always sought to confront the  challenges  posed  by  poverty
and underdevelopment, and  to  ensure  a  better  life  for  all  through  a
comprehensive programme of social transformation.
Central to  this  programme  is  the  fundamental  transformation  of  local
government from one that is  characterised  by  racially  skewed  settlement
patterns, disparities between towns and townships, and massive  backlogs  in
service infrastructure,  to  a  people-centred,  developmentally  orientated
sphere of government.

The  reason  for  placing  a  key  focus  on  the  transformation  of  local
government is that Government recognises that local  government  plays  four
very important roles. Firstly, it  is  the  sphere  of  government  directly
charged with the delivery of  basic  services  such  as  water,  sanitation,
roads, electricity and  other  services.  Secondly,  it  is  the  sphere  of
government, needless to say, closest to the people.  Thirdly,  it  plays  an
important role in promoting local economic  development  and  therefore  job
creation. Lastly, it  is  the  sphere  of  government  responsible  for  co-
ordinating the activities of other sectors and  spheres  of  government  for
the development of local communities.

In pursuance of these objectives to establish a local government model  that
is  people-centred,   developmentally   orientated   and   functional,   the
Government has embarked on  a  systematic  local  government  transformation
process which saw  the  enactment  of  various  pieces  of  legislation  and
policies necessary to achieve this objective.

Key pieces of legislation during  this  process  were  the  Organised  Local
Government Act, the Remuneration of Public Office  Bearers  Act,  the  Local
Government  Municipal  Demarcation  Act,  the  Local  Government   Municipal
Structures Act and the Local  Government  Municipal  Systems  Act.  Together
these Acts make up the core principles and  values  of  the  new  system  of
local government which the Government has committed itself to implementing.

The process of fundamental transformation,  although  not  fully  concluded,
was sealed with the 2000 local government elections, which  ushered  in  the
new model of local government. The transformation of local government  is  a
dynamic process with no clear-cut, fixed solutions.  Problems  may  crop  up
from time to time, for which the existing  legislation  may  not  have  made
provision.

Although the Organised Local Government Act and others are very good  pieces
of legislation - and  for  this  the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government must be commended - they will have to be  amended  from  time  to
time to make provision for changing circumstances. The  current  amendments,
however, were not necessitated by  such  changing  circumstances.  They  are
merely minor technical amendments to the  above  mentioned  Acts  to  ensure
their proper implementation.

If one looks at this Act, it is clear that these core principles and  values
of our local government system  remain  very  sound.  In  no  way  do  these
amendments suggest that there is something fundamentally wrong with our  new
system  of  local  government.  They   merely   seek   to   ensure   greater
effectiveness in the implementation of our new system of local government.

Finally, I have absolutely  no  doubt  that  these  amendments  will  indeed
achieve  the  objective  of  strengthening   the   implementation   process.
[Applause.]

Me C BOTHA: Agb Voorsitter, Minister  Mufamadi,  hierdie  wetsontwerp  wysig
nie minder as ses wette nie. Die meeste wysigings is  tegnies  van  aard  en
onbestrede. Dit dui ook op 'n belangrike  aspek  van  die  wetgewingsproses.
Parlementêre  komitees  behoort   genoegsame   tyd   vergun   te   word   om
konsepwetgewing deeglik te bestudeer sodat die eindproduk duideliker is  vir
die gebruiker en nie die  weg  ooplaat  vir  misverstande  of  uiteenlopende
interpretasies nie. Wette moet eintlik so  geskryf  word  dat  dit  nie  aan
praktiserende prokureurs en advokate werk verskaf nie.

Verskeie wysigings is aangebring om spelfoute  in  die  Afrikaanse  teks  te
korrigeer. Ek weet nie hoekom hulle in  die  eerste  instansie  te  voorskyn
gekom het nie, want 'n rekenaartoets behoort hierdie foute  voor  publikasie
te verwyder  het.  Dit  is  iets  waarna  die  regsadviseurs  en  versorgers
voorbehoedend moet kyk.

In die Gesamentlike Begrotingskomitee het die departement aangedui  dat  die
langverwagte konsepwetgewing op eiendomsbelasting voor  die  einde  van  die
jaar voor hierdie komitee sal dien. Wyslik het hulle nie  gesê  watter  jaar
nie. Hierdie wetgewing is uiters noodsaaklik om te  verhinder  dat  ons  nie
intussen verval in 'n situasie waar belastingsheffings op  'n  ad  hoc-basis
geskied nie.

Tans gebeur dit in die Vrystaat ten opsigte van landbou-eiendom wat  alreeds
gelei het tot groot uitgawes ten opsigte van waardasies en hofprosedures  en
les bes die verlies  aan  vertroue  by  'n  gemeenskap  wat  nie  genoegsaam
geraadpleeg is nie.

Ons sien juis in hierdie wetgewing 'n nodige,  maar  terugwerkende  klousule
om wettige sekerheid te verkry ten opsigte van eiendomheffings in die  Wes-,
Oos- en Noord-Kaap. Klousule 44 wat 'n wysiging is van artikel 118  van  die
sistemewet is heeltemal ontoereikend. Dit beskerm munisipaliteite ten  koste
van eienaars, wanneer eiendom nie oorgedra word  as  daar  eiendomsbelasting
en someer uitstaande is nie. Die verkoper moet nou  die  verantwoordelikheid
vir hierdie uitstaande skuld aanvaar, al is dit deur 'n huurder  veroorsaak.
Dit beteken dat die koper of verkoper die  gevolge  moet  dra  van  'n  swak
invorderingsbeleid en kontrole van 'n munisipaliteit. Die DA ondersteun  nie
hierdie klousule nie en glo dat daar  indringend  gekyk  moet  word  na  die
totale omvang van die probleem en dat  die  voorgestelde  wysiging  nie  die
werklike probleem aanspreek nie.

Klousule 45 maak voorsiening daarvoor dat 'n raadslid  nie  vir  'n  periode
van drie maande agterstallig mag wees met sy  of  haar  munisipale  heffings
nie. Mnr Bouwer het ter toeligting gesê dat optrede teen  raadslede,  indien
hulle hierdie bepaling oortree, kan  geskied  volgens  die  gedragskode  vir
raadslede van  die  strukturewet.  Hierin  word  riglyne  neergelê  oor  hoe
opgetree moet word wanneer 'n raadslid die kode se bepalings oortree.
Ek is bewus van groot uitstaande bedrae deur raadslede wat in ons  provinsie
onder die  aandag  van  die  betrokke  Minister  gebring  is.  Ek  gaan  met
belangstelling  kyk  hoe  die   klousule   toegepas   word.   Met   genoemde
voorbehoude, ondersteun die DA hierdie wetgewing. (Translation of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Ms C BOTHA: Hon Chairperson, Minister Mufamadi, this Bill  amends  no  less
than six Acts. Most of the amendments are of  a  technical  nature  and  are
uncontroversial. It is  also  indicative  of  an  important  aspect  of  the
legislative process. Parliamentary committees  should  be  given  sufficient
time to study the draft legislation thoroughly so that the  end  product  is
clearer  to  the  user  and  that  it   does   not   leave   loopholes   for
misunderstandings  or  various  interpretations.  Laws  should  in  fact  be
drafted in such a manner that  they  do  not  provide  work  for  practising
attorneys and advocates. Various amendments were made  to  correct  spelling
errors in the Afrikaans text. I do not know why they occurred in  the  first
instance, because a computer test should have  remove  these  errors  before
publication. This is something that the law advisers and  the  editors  must
look at preventatively.

In the Joint Budget  Committee  the  department  indicated  that  the  long-
awaited  draft  legislation  on  property  rates  will  serve  before   this
committee before the end of the year. Wisely, they did not say  which  year.
This legislation is extremely essential to prevent us in the meanwhile  from
degenerating into a situation where taxes are levied on an ad hoc basis.

Currently in the  Free  State  this  happens  with  regard  to  agricultural
property that has already led to major expenses  in  respect  of  valuations
and court procedures and, last but not least, to the  loss  of  trust  in  a
community that was not adequately consulted.

We see in this very legislation a necessary  but  retrospective  clause  for
obtaining legal certainty with regard to property  levies  in  the  Western,
Eastern and the Northern Cape. Clause 44, which is an amendment  to  section
118  of  the  systems   Act,   is   entirely   inadequate.   It   safeguards
municipalities at the expense of owners, where property is  not  transferred
when property rates and so forth are in arrears. The seller must now  assume
responsibility for the arrears, even though it was generated  by  a  tenant.
This implies that the buyer or the seller must bear the  consequences  of  a
poor recovery policy and poor control by a municipality.  The  DA  does  not
support this clause and believes that the total scope of the  problem  needs
to be looked at incisively and that the proposed amendment does not  address
the real problem.

Clause 45 provides that a councillor may not be in arrears with his  or  her
municipal levies for a period of three months. By way of  clarification,  Mr
Bouwer said that action against councillors, if they should contravene  this
provision, can take place  in  accordance  with  the  code  of  conduct  for
councillors of the structures Act. Guidelines as to what  action  should  be
taken when a councillor contravenes the provisions  of  the  code  are  laid
down in this code.
I am aware of huge outstanding amounts by councillors in our  province  that
were brought to the attention of the relevant Minister. I am going to  watch
with interest how the  clause  will  be  applied.  With  the  aforementioned
reservations, the DA supports this legislation.]

Mnr J HORNE:  Agb  Voorsitter,  die  Huis  sal  met  my  saamstem  dat  alle
Ministers en alle lede wat vandag gepraat het, baie  lank  gepraat  het.  Ek
dink die Minister van Plaaslike Regering het die kortste gepraat  en  daarom
sal ons sy voorbeeld volg en die kortpad of die middeweg  volg  -  maar  ons
sal nog steeds die waarheid praat.

Die wysigingswetsontwerp voel ons, alhoewel van 'n  tegniese  aard,  is  van
kardinale  belang  om  sekere   belangrike   aangeleenthede   op   plaaslike
bestuursvlak aan te spreek. Enkele tegniese regstellings is byvoorbeeld  die
herroeping van oorgangsmaatreëls om sekere vasstellings en betalings  geldig
te verklaar, asook die betaling van klein uitgawes aan  tradisionele  leiers
wat aan die verrigtinge van munisipale rade  deelneem.  Tradisionele  leiers
moet dus aangemoedig en gemotiveer word om deel te neem aan die  verrigtinge
van plaaslike regerings om sodoende  die  vooruitgang  van  hulle  mense  te
bevorder en te verseker dat hulle sodoende  deel  gaan  wees  van  plaaslike
regering wat die lewe van die mense op die grond bepaal.

Nog 'n belangrike wysiging is die een wat die  Kaapse  Waardasie-ordonnansie
raak. Ons het onlangs gesien hoe  die  Kaapse  Metropool  'n  regverdige  en
gelyke waardasie- en belastingsbeleid ingestel het wat  eiendomme  en  grond
betref. Daar was geen optogte in die straat. Die mense wat gemurmureer  het,
is  die  gegoede  mense.  Die   agtergeblewe   mense   word   deur   hierdie
belastingbeleid opgehef sodat ook hulle die kop bo water kan hou.  Ook  word
daar in die wet voorsiening gemaak vir die  vermindering  van  lede  op  die
Afbakeningsraad. Wat nog meer van  relevante  belang  is,  is  dat  die  wet
bepaal dat raadslede nie agterstallig mag wees ten opsigte  van  belastings-
en dienstegeld vir langer as drie maande nie. Ek is stellig van  mening  dat
hierdie byvoeging raadslede sal maan om die voorbeeld  te  stel  dat  om  'n
diens te gebruik, beteken ook om vir daardie diens te  betaal.  So  nie,  is
mens se begrafnis op die spel.

Die NP is van mening  dat  die  wysiging  nodig  en  daarom  steun  ons  die
wetsontwerp. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon Chairperson, the House will agree  with  me  that  all  the
Ministers and members who spoke today have spoken at great length.  I  think
the Minister of Local Government spoke for the shortest length of  time,  so
we shall follow his example by taking the shortcut or middle way  -  but  we
will still speak the truth.

We believe the amending Bill, although technical  in  nature,  is  of  vital
importance to address certain important matters at local  management  level.
A few technical  adjustments,  for  example,  have  been  the  abolition  of
transitional measures to declare certain rates and payments valid, and  also
the payment of minor expenses to traditional leaders who participate in  the
proceedings of municipal councils. Traditional leaders should  therefore  be
encouraged  and  motivated  to  participate  in  the  proceedings  of  local
governments, and in this way  promote  the  progress  of  their  people  and
ensure that they are subsequently going  to  be  part  of  local  government
which determines the lives of the people at grassroots level.

Another  important  amendment  is  the  one  affecting  the  Cape  Valuation
Ordinance.  We  have  recently  seen  the  Cape  Metropole  instituting   an
equitable and equal valuation and rates policy in respect  of  property  and
land. There were no marches in the streets. Those people  who  grumbled  are
the affluent ones. The disadvantaged  people  are  being  uplifted  by  this
rates policy so that they can also keep their heads above  water.  Provision
is also being made in the legislation  for  a  decrease  in  the  number  of
members serving on the Demarcation Board. What is of even greater  relevance
is that the legislation provides that council members may not be in  arrears
for more than  three  months  with  regard  to  rates  and  services.  I  am
certainly of the opinion that this addition will  urge  council  members  to
set the example that using a service also means paying for that service.  If
not, you are putting your neck on the line.

The New NP is of the opinion that the amendment is necessary, and  therefore
supports the Bill. [Applause.]]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, hon Minister, I wish to address  the  Bill  with
particular reference to clause 20, and matters related thereto.

Section 229(5) of the Constitution reads:


  National legislation envisaged in this section may be enacted only  after
  organised local government and the Financial and Fiscal  Commission  have
  been consulted, and any  recommendations  of  the  Commission  have  been
  considered.

In my view this has not been done. My information is that clause 20  of  the
Bill was only referred to the Financial and  Fiscal  Commission's  chairman,
not to the committee, which consists of 22 members, and  thus  the  FFC  was
not consulted.

The Cape Town municipality tried to include this amendment on 19 June.  This
was not done, but only later was this amendment brought in, at a  late  date
in the portfolio  committee.  These  clauses  are  retrospective  and  could
frustrate at least two court cases, one of which has been on the roll  since
June and the other, I believe, since May. They are expected to be  heard  in
November and with  retrospective  legislation,  the  people  might  well  be
frustrated.

I am not arguing the merits; I am arguing the fact that these people  should
have a hearing. There has been a lack of consultation  at  local  government
level, and the public have  not  been  heard.  There  has  been  a  lack  of
consultation at national level, where we have steadfastly  refused  to  hear
the voice of the  ratepayers.  We  are  frustrating  these  ratepayers  with
retrospective legislation from  possibly  being  heard  in  court.  We  have
failed to consult the Financial and Fiscal Commission  and  are  introducing
retrospective legislation.

We are possibly changing the whole nature  of  local  government  rates  and
taxes that are normally levied to provide  for  services  rendered.  We  see
here a new, uneven tax, ushered in by stealth,  which  is  unfair,  unlawful
and unrelated to services provided. In fact it is a wealth  tax.  Cape  Town
can no longer have ratepayers, but taxpayers. No one has  anticipated  this.
This was not the intention  of  Sars,  if  one  reads  their  documentation.
Parliament is now co-operating in this deception.

We are thus opposed to the  Bill.  We  call  upon  the  Minister  please  to
reconsider the matter very seriously. I am not arguing the merits,  but  the
process. The fact is that ratepayers should have the right to be heard,  and
they have  been  obstructed  from  being  heard  at  every  possible  level.
Otherwise they would not be going to  this  huge  expense  of  taking  these
matters to the High Courts at their personal expense in the  way  that  they
have. I request the Minister perhaps  to  subtract  this  section,  hold  it
back, reconsider it or let it be properly dealt with.

We have little argument with the rest of the Bill. We also  agree  with  the
Minister's comments about the enormous progress that has been made at  local
government  level.  But  we  ask  the  Minister   that   there   should   be
consultation. Otherwise, in our view, this legislation is unlawful. We  will
be opposing the legislation because of this.

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, the recognition  of
local government in the Constitution as a sphere of government has  enhanced
the  status  of  local  government  as  a  whole,  and   municipalities   in
particular, and has  given  them  a  new  dynamic  role  as  instruments  of
delivery.

The Bill before us today seeks to address the challenges that  face  current
legislation in order to create certainty and uniformity, so  as  to  clarify
and restate policy, while some amendments are technical in nature.

The World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  and  especially  the  local
government session, recognised the South African system of local  government
as a model for best practices as far as local government is  concerned.  The
Bill emanates from the attempt to address  challenges  arising  from  policy
implementation with regard to our local government, and should  be  seen  as
an improvement in that regard.

Noma-ke  kunjalo,  zikhona  zona   izinkinga   ezikhona   laphaya   ezingeni
lohulumeni  basekhaya.  Njengesimo  sokukhishwa   kwama-tender,   ama-tender
atholakala ekhishwa mhlawumbe eqondana nje nabantu abathile.

Kulesi sikhashana kade kunekhomishini ka-Dk  Hadebe  KwaZulu-Natali  ephenya
ngesikhalo  esikhulu   esesibe   khona   ngokukhishwa   kwama-tender   lapho
okutholakale    khona     omunye     womphakathi     enikezwe     ama-tender
ayisishiyagalombili eyedwa, kodwa  banye  bengakwazi  ukuwathola  ama-tender
noma ngabe benza yiphi imizamo. Okunye okubuye kube inkinga khona  esigabeni
salaphaya kohulumeni basemakhaya, indaba yamakhansela yokuvimbela  intuthuko
ngezikhathi ezithile emphakathini ethile.

Amaphrojekthi njengamanje ahanjiswa ezindaweni lezo  eziyizizinda  ezesekela
lawo makhansela emaqenjini awo. Lokhu  kube  sekudala  inkinga  yokuthi  uma
kwenzakele mhlawumbe umuntu noma  umphakathi  othile  ukuthi  ufake  isicelo
sephrojekthi siphumelele, uma  ikhansela  belingakwazi  lokho  liyasivimbela
futhi sisichithe leso sicelo. Lowo mphakathi  ugcina  ungasizakalanga  ngoba
ungalesekeli lelo khansela. Besingafisa ukuthi lezi zinto zilandeleke  ukuze
uma lokhu kuqhubeka ekukhishweni kwama-tender ngendlela engeyona  kuvinjelwe
kungaze kuqhubeke isikhathi eside ngoba kungumonakalo omkhulu.

Thina njengoKhongolose sithi siyakwesekela kakhulu  ukuchitshiyelwa  kwalesi
sigatshana soMthetho ngoba sinenkolelo yokuthi  kuzoba  wusizo  ekusebenzeni
kwamakhansela. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Nevertheless, there are problems at the  local  government  level.  Due  to
issuing of tenders, some tenders that are being issued are given to  certain
individuals.

Recently in KwaZulu-Natal, there was a  Dr  Hadebe's  commission  which  was
investigating the issuing of tenders. It was discovered that one  member  of
the public alone had been given eight tenders, while others were  unable  to
get them, no matter how hard they tried.  Another  thing  that  has  created
problems at  local  government  level,  is  the  issue  of  councillors  who
hindered the development in the community at some other time.

Projects at the moment are sent to areas  where  the  political  parties  of
these councillors enjoy support. This causes a problem when someone  or  the
community launches an application and has that application approved. If  the
councillor was not aware of that application, he would reject  it.  I  would
like these things to be followed up so that  this  illegal  way  of  issuing
tenders will be stopped before it causes serious trouble.

We in the ANC support the amendment of the clause because  we  believe  that
it is going to help in the way the councillors work. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson,  first  of
all, allow me to thank everybody who participated in  this  debate.  I  also
wish  to  thank  the  hon  Mr  Mkhaliphi,  the  chairperson  of  the  select
committee, and all other members of that committee for the support  and  co-
operation they extended to the department and the  Ministry  for  Provincial
and Local Government.

Apart from comments on the content of the proposed  amendments,  advice  was
given by various speakers to the department and  the  Ministry.  I  want  to
assure them that we have taken that advice to heart  and,  where  necessary,
we will act on that.

I note that the hon Mr Durr has problems with the consultation  process.  He
refers to the FFC as one of the bodies that were not  consulted.  Of  course
there is no basis in fact in that  allegation.  [Interjections.]  I  do  not
know about the internal problems of the FFC. What I am talking about is  the
FFC's having responded in writing to Parliament and saying  that  they  have
been  consulted.  Also,  the  ratepayers  were  actually  invited  and  they
appeared   before   the   portfolio   committee   to    make    submissions.
[Interjections.]  I  doubt  if  they  have  appointed  Mr  Durr   as   their
spokesperson. In any case, if they appointed him, they should  not  pay  him
because he has misrepresented their case.

I also note that the hon member C Botha  has  difficulties  with  voting  in
favour of the proposed amendments. But  I  suspect  that  there  are  enough
people of goodwill in the House, and the Bill will go  through.  I  wish  to
thank members for their co-operation. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                         BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Chairperson and hon  members,  a  few  weeks
ago, on  23  October,  I  presented  the  Broadcasting  Amendment  Bill  for
deliberation in the National Assembly and the majority of  parties  accepted
it. Reflections on the challenges we face as a  country  and  the  necessary
means needed to overcome them had resulted, in great  measure,  in  what  we
call in  Afrikaans  ``toenadering''  [seeking  common  ground]  amongst  the
various language speakers of our country.

In my presentation to the Assembly I highlighted the fact that the Bill  was
indeed  a  product  of  serious  engagement  amongst  various  stakeholders,
although at times there were attempts to divert us from the critical  issues
at hand.

When we presented  the  Bill  for  public  discussion  we  were  accused  of
harbouring ill intentions to take over control of the SABC and turn it  into
a  state  broadcaster.  In  some  quarters   this   view   still   persists,
irrespective of us having clarified from the outset that we  were  ready  to
receive  inputs  and  engage  with  stakeholders  to  find  mechanisms   and
formulations that are acceptable to all concerned, and having accepted  some
of these in the final version of this Bill in the Assembly.

An example of this view that deserves national attention was expressed by  a
well-known journalist, Max du Preez, who charged that:


  The public broadcaster does not belong to you ...

Meaning me -


  ... or your Government, nor should it be answerable to you. It belongs to
  us citizens and the licence holders.

Indeed, I believe that the broadcaster does  not  belong  to  me  or  to  my
Government.  What  is  important,  though,  is  that  Max,  like  previously
advantaged South Africans, does not believe that my Government is  also  his
Government or their Government, whether they voted for it or  not.  If  they
are South Africans, then it is their Government. I am  also  a  citizen  and
also a licence holder. Therefore, the public broadcaster belongs to  all  of
us. As long as this Government is in office, I  know  it  will  continue  to
govern in the interests of all and not of some.

Indeed, there  are  certain  principles  that  are  clearly  non-negotiable,
especially in regard to the role of the  broadcasting  sector  in  promoting
and protecting the rights of all South Africans, as enshrined  in  the  Bill
of Rights. Our position that the broadcasting system should seek to  promote
the national interests of the Republic, as represented by the  Constitution,
remains unchanged even today.

Others, like the DP, have argued that there is no need for the  Broadcasting
Amendment  Bill.  They  argue  that  all  we  need  now  is  the   converged
communications Act  that  will  separate  regulation  of  transmission  from
regulation of content. We agree with the general argument for  the  need  to
deal  with  the  convergence  of   broadcasting,   information   technology,
telecommunications and new media.  We  have  spoken  on  numerous  occasions
about the work we  are  doing  to  prepare  for  the  convergence  of  these
sectors. Only two weeks ago I received detailed reports  from  two  advisory
bodies that were tasked to make policy recommendations  to  Government.  One
report dealt with digital broadcasting within  the  context  of  convergence
and the other dealt  with  the  production  and  display  of  South  African
content in the future.

Those who argue, such as the DP does, that  we  should  ignore  the  present
realities and rush to usher in converged digital systems  that  are  lightly
regulated - if regulated at all - miss some of the fundamental  issues  that
we must tackle today in order to lay foundations for the  future.  Our  work
to  restructure   the   communications   sectors   like   broadcasting   and
telecommunications, symbolised by  this  amendment  Bill  and  the  recently
passed  Telecommunications  Amendment  Bill,  are  building  blocks   to   a
converged future.

It makes no sense to  converge  industries  dominated  by  a  single  player
inasmuch as it makes no sense to converge players that are not regulated  in
a similar manner. Government took a conscious  decision  to  liberalise  the
telecommunications industry in order to allow for managed  competition,  the
growth of the sector and investments in  infrastructure.  The  establishment
of the necessary infrastructure will ensure  competition  in  the  converged
services.

Similarly, the Broadcasting Amendment Bill requires all operators to hold  a
licence and  to  compete  under  similar  conditions.  This  will  establish
certainty that will foster investment in  services  and  in  infrastructure.
The requirement that all operators  must  hold  licences  enables  us  as  a
country to impose obligations about the nature and  the  quantity  of  South
African content that we want displayed in  our  broadcasting  system.  These
obligations must be shouldered by  the  operators,  even  in  the  converged
future, if our culture is to be protected and to be celebrated.

We  must  all  accept  that  communications  policy  cannot  be  driven   by
technology only, but must be related to  real  needs.  People's  needs  must
drive us. In the broadcasting sector there are  real  needs  that  have  not
been addressed. The infrastructure  is  deployed  in  such  a  way  that  it
favours the cities at the expense of rural areas.  Not  all  South  Africans
can  receive  services  of  their  choice  because  of  the   infrastructure
backlogs.

Even those South Africans who receive services still do  not  find  services
in the languages of their choice.  It  is  therefore  important  that  as  a
country we address these  real  needs.  We  cannot  allow  ourselves  to  be
dazzled by technology and forget that our role as  people's  representatives
is to ensure the delivery of meaningful services in an inclusive way to  all
South Africans.

There is still a need to arrive at some form of consensus that at  no  stage
was  the   regulation   of   broadcasting   informed   only   by   technical
considerations. There has always been a wider, more encompassing reason  why
broadcasting should be regulated beyond the  capacity  of  the  airwaves  to
carry many channels. The broadcasting industry  is  an  important  cultural,
social and economic player. These activities need some  form  of  regulation
in order to arrive at desired policy objectives,  including  the  protection
and reflection of South African culture;  the  protection  of  children  and
minors from exposure to violence, sex and nudity; the  protection  of  South
African broadcasting entities in a global  world  and  the  availability  of
channels to all sectors of our  population  for  their  informed  democratic
participation.

As the DP  will  know,  the  market  has  its  own  failures.  Society  must
intervene through regulation to protect those who are in need of  protection
in case of  market  failures.  In  broadcasting,  market  failures  manifest
themselves  in  many  ways,  including  the  inability  of   South   African
programmes to compete with foreign programmes at this  particular  stage  in
time - this does not mean that in the future we should not be  able  to  say
there should be a free-for-all - the unavailability  of  services  to  those
whom advertisers consider as not desirable markets, like some of you and  I,
and the lack of universal access to services.
In the final analysis, analysis must bear in mind that we  are  enjoined  by
the Constitution to regulate broadcasting to ensure plurality of  views  and
in the public interest for nation-building. These considerations will be  as
relevant in the future as they are today, irrespective of the  technological
advances that may come our way.

The fact that in the end consensus was reached on a wide range of issues  is
a clear vindication of the  commitment  of  our  Government  and  people  to
upholding the principles of democracy above sound bites and sensationalism.

Hon  members,  in  the  same  spirit  in  which  we  tabled  this  Bill  for
deliberation in the National Assembly, we  hereby  present  before  you  the
outcome of a vigorous consultative policy process for your consideration.

Concern has been expressed about the potential dilution  of  the  powers  of
the Regulator, who  is  constitutionally  empowered  to  issue  broadcasting
licences. The Bill addresses this concern adequately. It  provides  for  the
Regulator to monitor and to enforce the charter of the  public  broadcaster.
It provides for all operators to seek licences and  authorisation  prior  to
commencement of their operations. It therefore places  all  operators  under
the regulatory scheme of the Regulator. The procedures for the  granting  of
additional pay licences are catered for, thus allowing  competition  in  the
sector.

The Bill also brings greater clarity by categorising different  licences  in
accordance with the services provided. In this particular  respect  we  wish
to thank those that made  technical  inputs,  such  as  MultiChoice,  M-Net,
Orbicom, Sentech and Telkom, as well as the SABC  and  Icasa,  and  bringing
about this clarity.

The Bill  also  provides  for  the  implementation  of  the  conversion  and
corporatisation  of  the  SABC.  It  includes  a   charter,   as   well   as
accountability and compliance mechanisms. It strengthens  the  role  of  the
publicly selected board in terms of governance,  as  well  as  the  role  of
Icasa in terms of regulation, licensing and monitoring.

The split of the SABC into two divisions, difficult as it may be, allows  us
to have the SABC's commercial activity able to compete with  others  fairly,
so that there is no  perception  that  the  SABC's  commercial  activity  is
subsidised by Government. Secondly, any funds for  the  public  broadcasting
service from the fiscus are accounted for properly in terms of the PMFA.

To ensure delivery by the public broadcaster  on  its  mandate,  it  is  now
required by law  that  the  SABC  prepares  and  submits  to  the  Regulator
policies  that  will  ensure  compliance  with   the   Regulator's   licence
conditions as well as objectives of the Broadcasting Act.

The Board of the SABC must ensure public participation  in  the  development
of policies and institute regular and  effective  means  to  solicit  public
opinion about its programming and give  due  consideration  to  that  public
input. The SABC must also develop its own code of  conduct  to  ensure  that
the corporation complies with the constitutional principle of  equality  and
equitable treatment of all people, all languages and the rights  of  all  to
information. The SABC is expected to strive to provide for a wide  range  of
audience  interests,  beliefs  and  expressions  and  a  high  standard   of
accuracy, fairness and impartiality must be adhered to.

This Bill also provides for the establishment of  regional  services  within
the SABC as entities under  the  full  control  of  the  SABC  board.  These
television services that will broadcast regionally in languages  appropriate
to the regions achieve one of the founding principles of  the  Constitution.
This not only gives greater  coverage  to  indigenous  languages,  but  also
recognises the cultural diversity and needs of our people and  enriches  our
society.

This Bill also states that the regional services should receive grants  from
the state and that revenue can also be drawn  from  sponsorships,  donations
and other grants.

In conclusion, I must repeat that this  Bill  is  about  real  issues,  real
people and their real needs. We have sought to ensure that the  broadcasting
system as a whole contributes to making a difference in  people's  lives  by
allowing for  a  reflection  of  their  reality  and  enhancement  of  their
empowerment so that they can participate in  sociopolitical  discussions  in
order to shape the future of this country and its people. [Applause.]

(Translation of Tsonga paragraph follows.)

[Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister of  Communications  Dr  Matsepe-
Casaburri, and hon members, I  thank  you.  Our  Constitution  allows  human
rights in accordance with different  languages,  especially  languages  that
are not used in  electronic  media,  such  as  television.  Every  broadcast
promotes the English language and neglects other languages and by  so  doing
fails to fulfil the rights and needs of the Constitution. [Interjections.]]

Ms J L KGOALE: Chairperson, may we raise a concern about the interpreting.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, indeed,  according  to  my
records here the hon member could be speaking  either  English  or  Xitsonga
and, of course, democratically she has  actually  chosen  Xitsonga.  Now,  I
wonder how the desk can help me because it is true that we do  not  get  any
interpreting.   I   understand   that   they   are   looking   into    that.
[Interjections.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, I do not know, maybe something has just  happened.
I did communicate with the interpreter. I gave him my speech.

A ndzi tivi ku ri ku humelela yini. [I do not know what happened.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES  (Mr  M  J  MAHLANGU):  Hon  member,  I
understand. I am told by the desk that indeed that was  arranged.  They  are
trying to check as to what is happening.

Mrs C NKUNA: Mutshami wa xitulu, ndzi nga ya emahlweni. [Chairperson, can  I
continue?]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES (Mr M J  MAHLANGU):  I  think  the  hon
member can continue. The interpreter is coming.

Vuhaxi byin'wana ni byin'wana lebyi tlakusaka ririmi ra  xinghezi  byi  siya

Xitsonga paragraphs follows.)

[Every broadcast that promotes  the  English  language  and  neglects  other
languages fails to satisfy the rights or needs of the  people.  PanSALB  did
some research and pointed out that 85% of people in South Africa  prefer  to
make use of their mother tongue when they communicate. I, too, as a  citizen
of South Africa, feel comfortable today when I deliberate in my  own  mother
tongue, namely Xitsonga.

Xitsonga is one of the languages that is not considered by the  broadcasting
corporation. It would be very good if speakers of  all  languages  in  South
Africa could listen to news presentations  and  other  programmes  in  their
respective languages. People want to know about the  developments  that  are
taking place in  their  own  country.  How  will  people  know  about  these
developments if the language that is used is not understood by listeners.

Democracy does not refer to compliance alone,  but  includes  communication,
and one must be heard. It includes seeing to it that the rights of  workers,
the disabled, women and children  should  be  fulfilled.  The  amendment  of
section 32 of this Act will enable us to achieve these needs  and  requests.
This will enable all disabled people of all different categories to  achieve
their needs and rights.

When we speak a language, it explains who we are. It explains  something  of
our tradition and heritage. It explains something of our habits  and  deeds.
Who are we without our languages?]

The hon the Minister, when tabling this Bill, reaffirmed that the  media  is
fundamental to democracy and a free media is an imperative.  For  the  first
time we are assured  through  law  that  the  SABC  will  operate  within  a
constitutional framework in its dealings with the public  and  their  needs.
This is the reason we need to regulate.

The underpinning logic for regulating broadcasting has  always  been  larger
than the mere allocation of frequencies which  are  public  assets.  History
shows that broadcasting policy over the past 70  years  and,  hopefully  for
more years to come, has been influenced by societal needs. We are a  country
in transition, from apartheid to a mature democracy. As such, we have  needs
that are unique and deserving of policy interventions from time to time,  to
define the ends that will be in line with our democratic objectives.

In this, we are not different from all other countries that have  sought  to
use broadcasting  policy  and  legislation  to  protect  and  advance  their
national culture, protecting  their  homes  from  undesirable  content  that
might reach their children through the media.  There  is  a  need  for  this
Government to act consistently to build a united South Africa in  which  all
its people feel accommodated. There is no more room  for  any  consideration
which places the interests of any language speaker above  the  interests  of
another language speaker. Those notions died with apartheid.

The lobbyists are invited to make an input in  shaping  the  Public  Service
that they want. There is an  avenue  to  enter  the  discussions  and  shape
policies. They should utilise this opportunity and make their  contributions
in the discussions that will shape the services of the SABC.

In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to thank  the  Minister
and the department for introducing this piece of legislation. I  also  thank
the  committee  for  their  commitment  and  hard  work  shown  during   the
deliberation on a Broadcasting Amendment  Bill.  It  has  been  my  pleasure
working on this Bill, for this is something close to my  heart,  as  I  also
belong  to  one  of  the  minority  cultures  whose  languages  do  not  get
broadcasting coverage. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES (Mr M J MAHLANGU): Order! I  just  want
to apologise profusely to hon members for that inconvenience. From the  desk
I am told that the Hansard was actually aware of this and unfortunately  the
person who was supposed to come and interpret did not turn up. A  report  is
coming to that effect. We wish to apologise for that.

Mnr F ADAMS:  Agb  Voorsitter,  Minister  en  lede,  die  Nuwe  NP  glo  dat
aansienlike  vordering  gemaak  is  om  die  Wysigingswetsontwerp   op   die
Uitsaaiwese in oorstemming te bring met die Grondwet.

Die Nuwe NP is bly dat die gewysigde wetsontwerp ook  voorsiening  sal  maak
vir   openbare   deelname   in   die   opstel   van   beleid.    Die    2002
Wysigingswetsontwerp  op  die  Uitsaaiwese  het  heelwat  polemiek  in   die
koerante  uitgelok,  rondom  die  kwessie  van  die  SAUK  se   redaksionele
onafhanklikheid. Die  Regering  se  voorneme  om  nuwe  kanale  te  skep  om
inheemse tale te bevorder is prysenswaardig. Die  Regering  het  uiteindelik
besef dat die huidige stand die grondwetlike status van hierdie tale skend.

'n Openbare uitsaaier moet regverdige en billike verteenwoordiging van  tale
in sy volle reeks van  programme  verseker.  'n  Mens  hoef  nie  'n  Afrika
kulturele nasionalis te wees om te besef dat daar  'n  groot  massa  Afrika-
menings is wat 'n uitsaaiteenwoordigheid benodig nie. Wanneer jy egter  drie
kanale het wat daaraan toegewy is om nasionaal uit te  saai  en  jy  het  11
nasionale tale wat geakkommodeer moet word, word die kern  meer  ingewikkeld
as die ideaal.

Daar is kommersiële realiteite in 'n globale  konteks  waar  televisie  moet
reageer op kommersieel-gedrewe mededingers. Die Nuwe NP se  uitgangspunt  is
dat die SAUK die infrastruktuur en bedrewendheid het om aan ons  'n  stelsel
te verskaf wat 'n maksimum aan taal- en kultuurvryheid  en  uitdrukking  sal
toelaat - die voorvereiste vir versoening.
Ons benadering is ook in eenstemming met beginsels en riglyne van  die  nuwe
uitsaaiwet.   Vir   die    tegnologie-begunstigdes    het    kulturele    en
taaldiversiteit beteken: ``dat die eter so wyd soos God se genade is''.  Die
moderne tegnologie ``is 'n gawe van God om te lewe en  te  laat  lewe''  vir
die voorsiening  van  kulturele  Lebensraum  in  'n  tyd  van  onophoudelike
konflik op ander vlakke. Tegnologie laat ons toe om te differensieer  sonder
diskriminasie.

Ons bedank die Minister en sy span en almal wat hierdie  wetgewing  moontlik
gemaak  het.  Die  Nuwe  NP  sal  hierdie  wetsontwerp   steun.   [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson, Minister and  members,  the  New  NP  believes
that considerable progress  has  been  made  in  bringing  the  Broadcasting
Amendment Bill in line with the Constitution.

The New NP is glad that the  amended  Bill  will  also  provide  for  public
participation in the making of policy. The 2002 Broadcasting Amendment  Bill
evoked quite a lot of controversy in the newspapers, regarding the  question
of  the  SABC's  editorial  independence.  The  Government's  intention   of
creating new channels to promote indigenous languages  is  praiseworthy.  At
last  the  Government  has  realised  that  the  status  quo  violates   the
constitutional status of these languages.

A public broadcaster must ensure just and fair representation  of  languages
in its full series of programmes.  One  does  not  have  to  be  an  African
cultural nationalist to realise that  there  is  a  great  mass  of  African
opinion which requires a broadcasting presence. However, when one has  three
channels which are  dedicated  to  national  broadcasting  and  one  has  11
national languages that have to be accommodated, the  heart  of  the  matter
becomes more complicated than the ideal.

There are commercial realities in a global  context  where  television  must
react to commercially driven competitors. The New NP's  point  of  departure
is that the SABC has the infrastructure and  skill  to  provide  us  with  a
system which will allow a maximum  of  language  and  cultural  freedom  and
expression - the prerequisite for reconciliation.

Our approach is also in line with the principles and guidelines of  the  new
broadcasting  legislation.  For  the  technology  advantaged  cultural   and
language diversity means: ``dat die eter so wyd  soos  God  se  genade  is''
[that the ether  is  as  all-encompassing  as  the  grace  of  God].  Modern
technology is a gift from God to live and let  live  for  the  provision  of
cultural Lebensraum during a time of continual  conflict  at  other  levels.
Technology allows us to differentiate without discrimination.

We thank the Minister and his team and everyone who  made  this  legislation
possible. The New NP will support this Bill. [Applause.]]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, I will assume that  after  having  heard  the
Minister and the two other speakers, Ms  Botha's  party  will  change  their
mind. [Interjections.]

Chairperson, Minister and members, various nations have various  values  and
attitudes that  are  unique  to  them,  their  own  talents  and  their  own
contents,  which  are  reflected  in  the  programmes  broadcast  on   their
respective national television services. For  instance,  one  cannot  go  to
France and expect  to  see  Zimbabwean  cultural  content  dominating  their
television service, nor go to China and find South African  talent  promoted
more than Chinese talent. One would never find the national  news  in  Dubai
read in Xhosa. [Interjections.] That is simply because various  nations  see
the importance of reflecting their respective national values and  attitudes
on their television and, most importantly, in their national languages.

Unfortunately,  with  our  broadcasting  service  a  lot  of  that  is   not
reflected. It is  therefore  important  for  our  national  broadcasters  to
encourage the development of our own talent and content, reflecting our  own
values and attitudes.  Furthermore,  prioritising  the  development  of  our
local expression and providing  a  variety  of  programmes  in  the  various
languages of the country is critical.

One would have to look at why we focus on public broadcasting. The  amending
Bill provides for a charter of public  broadcasting.  The  charter  outlines
the mandate of the  public  broadcasting  system.  In  short,  the  SABC  is
required to be an organ of society that  ensures  the  forging  of  a  South
African identity and citizenship. The charter therefore  declares  that  the
programming of the SABC must, firstly,  reflect  South  African  values  and
attitudes; secondly, display South African  talent;  and  thirdly,  offer  a
variety of South African views and advance the national public interest.

This is very important for our democracy, so that  future  generations,  our
children, will know that they are born of  a  nation  that  takes  pride  in
itself, as the media has a way of influencing  how  people  think  and  view
things. If we americanise our media, our children  will  grow  up  confused,
thinking that to be important as a person one must  imitate  what  Americans
do.
This Bill also  provides  for  the  implementation  of  the  conversion  and
corporatisation of the SABC. That does not mean that people will be  out  of
jobs or that the SABC  is  being  privatised.  We  tried  our  best  in  the
committee. The department gave us examples and we are satisfied  that  there
is no restructuring nor privatisation that is  taking  place.  Maybe  people
will gain imisebenzi [jobs] because I will also be one of the  broadcasters.
[Interjections.]

Further, and most importantly, the Bill provides that the SABC must  develop
its own code of conduct to ensure that the  corporation  complies  with  the
constitutional principles of equality and the  equitable  treatment  of  all
people  and  languages,  and  the  rights  of  all  information.   That   is
fundamental, in particular to our human rights.

This Bill provides for  the  strengthening  of  the  role  of  the  publicly
selected board in  terms  of  governance.  That  board  must  ensure  public
participation in the development of policies. I think  the  chairperson  has
called on lobbyists to make further submissions, and here we  refer  to  the
institute's regular and effective means to solicit public opinion about  its
programming. I do not think anyone can  dispute  the  importance  of  public
participation. That is why we are all here.

The Bill further strengthens the role of Icasa in terms of the regulation  -
I think I heard the  Minister  mentioning  that  as  well  -  licensing  and
monitoring.

In conclusion, I cannot begin to  stress  the  importance  of  the  role  of
broadcasting services and the influence they have over how people think  and
perceive  things.  How  they  use  that  power  is  very,  very   important.
[Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES  (Mr  M  J  MAHLANGU):  Order!  The
gentleman who was going to speak on behalf of the IFP told me that I  should
apologise for his inability to partake in the debate. He said that  the  IFP
was going to support the Bill with  some  comments  that  the  state  should
guard against interference with editorial and  reporting  independence.  The
fear was that legitimacy and integrity should not be reduced.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, in the relatively short history of our  democracy
there  have  been  some  attempts  to  reinterpret  section   192   of   our
Constitution. For those who do not know, section  192  of  the  Constitution
provides that national legislation must establish an  independent  authority
to regulate broadcasting in the public interest, and to ensure fairness  and
a diversity of views broadly representing South African society.

When this Bill was first introduced in the National Assembly, the  portfolio
committee was confronted with the position that the SABC  Board  would  have
to submit  their  editorial  policy  to  the  hon  the  Minister.  The  only
motivation for this requirement that would  have  any  credibility  is  that
there was a desire for executive control of  the  SABC's  editorial  policy.
This would have been a clear  contravention  of  both  the  letter  and  the
spirit of section 192 of the Constitution. Thankfully, after  an  exhaustive
process in the portfolio committee, this provision is no longer part of  the
Bill. However, one cannot fail to question the motive for  putting  it  into
the Bill in the first place.

The DP believes that  the  contemplated  articles  of  association  for  the
corporatised SABC should be submitted to some form of  public  scrutiny  and
parliamentary approval, and not simply be left in the hands of the  hon  the
Minister. The DP would require a  similar  process  if  there  was,  at  any
stage, a contemplated change in the share capital or sale of shares  in  the
SABC.

In our view the SABC already enjoys a dominant  position  in  the  field  of
broadcasting, yet the new  section  22A  requires  the  SABC  to  apply  for
additional licences to enable it to broadcast regionally. In the event  that
regional licences are awarded to the SABC, it will also  enjoy  the  benefit
of public funding. We then need to ask: What about the concept of  diversity
that is enshrined in section 192 of the Constitution?

Diverse languages can be accommodated  by  entities  other  than  the  SABC.
Further, it is our view that the council's power to delegate its  authority,
as set out in the schedules, is too widely framed.  For  all  these  reasons
the DA will oppose this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, hon Minister, and hon delegates,  it  is  a  pity
that I am sitting next to two members of the DP - in fact, there  are  three
of them. I do not want to be associated with the DP. It is just  that  I  am
sitting here and there is nothing I can do. It is also unfortunate  that  we
have people who continuously  oppose  anything  that  Government  does.  One
begins to question their motives. What is good for South Africa is  bad  for
them. [Interjections.] What is bad  for  South  Africa  is  good  for  them.
[Interjections.] This is what their leader said at some stage.

If there is any past that humanity would like to forget, in South Africa  it
would obviously be the apartheid past. Throughout the world it would be  the
colonialism and imperialism in Africa and parts of the southern part of  the
world. Gradually in South Africa we are on the path  to  completely  destroy
the remnants of the apartheid legacy.

In this process of change there  will  be  those  who  oppose  such  changes
precisely because they want to cling to the  past,  however  in  a  modified
fashion. Such people are today represented by the  DP,  or  its  fashionable
new name, the Democratic Alliance. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Stick to the Bill.

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, the DP argues  that  regulating  broadcasting  in
the face of technological changes and advances is wrong. They further  state
that now that we can have as many channels as possible there  should  be  no
regulation at all.

In short they say that people should do as they  wish;  any  Tom,  Dick  and
Harry can have access to channels - it  is  not  a  problem;  abuse  of  our
airwaves is not a problem;  if  there  are  racist  channels  it  is  not  a
problem; if there are right-wing lunatic channels it is also not a  problem;
or if our children watch pornography that is shown during the day it is  not
a problem. To the DP it is fine. It is good for South  Africa.  It  is  good
for the DP, because  then  definitely  they  will  corrupt  our  people  and
corrupt our minds. [Interjections.]

What the DP forgets is  that  their  approach  is  a  recipe  for  disaster,
precisely because those with money will abuse a regime of no  regulation  to
misinform and mislead our people, and those  who  are  poor  and  vulnerable
will have no say under such circumstances. We cannot take the DP  seriously,
because the recent floor-crossing process by councillors has reaffirmed  our
view that their policies are absurd and ludicrous to most.  Only  Tony  Leon
and hon Mr Lever understand those policies.

In fact, now they are  saying  that  the  people  do  not  understand  their
policies very well and they will  therefore  have  to  redefine  and  refine
their policies in preparation for the 2004 elections. That is what  the  hon
Tony Leon was saying yesterday. What a shame! If  one  does  not  understand
one's policies, why does one want to engage in public  debate?  They  belong
nowhere but in the dustbin of history.

This is a revolutionary Bill.  It  requires  revolutionaries  and  dedicated
cadres to ensure that it succeeds in its clear intentions  and  mandate.  We
all need to respond to the clarion call  that  all  of  us  need  to  become
agents for change, volunteers for reconstruction and development. All of  us
in this House including the DP, must ask ourselves: What is it that we  need
to do to ensure that this Bill is implemented to its logical conclusion?

South African citizens should not be  confused  by  the  DP-DA  tendency  to
create fear and suspicion in the minds of our  people  that  our  Government
cannot be trusted. We ought to reaffirm to them that indeed  our  Government
was democratically elected and therefore given a  clear  mandate  to  effect
changes  and  ensure   that   social   transformation   does   take   place.
[Interjections.]
Whether the DP or the DA likes it or not, we will proceed  with  change.  If
it is a bitter pill to swallow, they will have to swallow it, because  today
we are governing and we will govern correctly.  The  ANC  will  continue  to
govern. The  floor-crossing  has  once  more  reaffirmed  that  they  belong
nowhere but where no person  can  go  to,  because  their  policies  do  not
respond to our people's needs. Their policies do not respond  to  the  needs
of the poor. They only serve those with capital. They only  serve  the  West
because they are the spokespersons for the West in South Africa.

No one  can  guarantee  our  national  interest  except  our  democratically
elected Government and legislatures. No one elects the media bosses but  our
people who, after every five years, elect our Government  and  reaffirm  the
legitimacy of the ANC.

We also need to reaffirm to our people that we  are  country  in  transition
from apartheid to a mature democracy, so the lunatics that are found in  the
DP are one of the things that we need to  accept.  Ours  is  a  new  country
which requires decisive policy interventions in  order  to  ensure  that  we
meet our democratic objectives.  Accordingly,  there  is  nothing  wrong  in
using our broadcasting policies and legislation to protect and  advance  our
democratic values by ensuring that our broadcasters remain within the  realm
of our Constitution in  terms  of  our  developmental  objectives,  culture,
language, tradition, etc.

In adhering to our  democratic  principle  of  popular  participation,  this
legislation makes it  compulsory  for  the  SABC  Board  to  ensure  popular
participation in development. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  thank  the
members of this House who clearly have paid  attention  to  the  content  of
this Bill, because it is a very important Bill for  South  Africa.  It  will
really revolutionise our society, and particularly public  participation  in
national  life.  It  is  therefore  very  important  for  this   House,   in
particular, where delegates represent the people on the ground  through  the
provinces. I find it particularly satisfying  to  have  seen  this  kind  of
engagement. I would like to thank the  members  for  their  engagement  with
this Bill.

I would like to tell Mr Adams of the  New  NP  that  I  certainly  like  the
phrase that he  uses  when  he  says  that  technology  should  be  used  to
differentiate, but  not  to  discriminate.  It  is  important  that  we  use
technology as a tool to improve the conditions,  especially  of  those  most
disadvantaged. I appreciate the fact that people do make the distinction.

With regard to hon Bhengu who was not here: I am very happy  that  at  least
the IFP will support this Bill. [Laughter.] But I would like to say that  he
can rest assured: under this Minister, under this  Government  there  is  no
way that we can turn back to where we  come  from.  We  are  the  ones  that
fought against interference in the policies and the work  of  the  SABC.  We
are the ones that defended that SABC and defended the rights of  the  people
with regard to that SABC.

Vorentoe  sal  ons  altyd  gaan.  Agtertoe   sal   ons   nooit   gaan   nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.]  [We  shall  always  go  forwards.  We  shall   never   go
backwards. [Interjections.]]

Therefore it is very important that he should rest assured  that  there  was
never any intention to interfere, particularly under this Minister, who  has
had experience of that SABC, and who did  not  allow  Government,  even  the
previous Government, to interfere. Whatever  interference  that  was  taking
place happened underground, and that they sometimes did quite a bit.

I would like to tell Mr Lever and his party that we contributed  to  section
192. I read it and reread it at the time that the Constitution was  drafted.
What I see is that there is always a motive ascribed  to  the  executive  to
control. No matter what this Government does, there is a  sinister  cynicism
and suspicion of the executive. When it is healthy, I have no  problem  with
that. But it cannot always be present. It is something I could hear  in  the
way many members of the House were expressing themselves. I think  as  South
Africans who ought to be coming together, we should be  able  to  have  less
and less of this cynicism,  but  indeed  objective  criticism  of  what  the
executive does.

However, because we have the kind of Constitution and  the  kind  of  ruling
party we have, we will always defend their democratic right to  oppose.  But
I hope he does not deny us the democratic right to make sure that they  will
not succeed in their opposition of  what  we  do.  [Interjections.]  Because
that democratic right is also enshrined  for  us.  Regardless  of  where  we
stand as South Africans, we all need  to  be,  in  the  words  of  the  last
speaker,  ``volunteers  for  reconstruction  and  development''.  This  Bill
indeed gives us an opportunity to ask: How do  we  make  this  South  Africa
better, using the public airwaves, which belong to all of us, to  make  this
a better South Africa, a prosperous South Africa, a South  Africa  in  which
all of us can live, even if we have different views?

The question was asked: How can we ensure diversity by giving everything  to
the SABC? There has been no suggestion as to how we would  be  able  to  get
African languages on the air, unless they were funded by the state.  Are  we
being told to fund private organisations to go and do programmes in  Tsonga,
in Venda and in Sotho, but not give such money to others?

I think what we are doing is to say we recognise that until that growth  has
happened,  we  will  have  to  continue  to  support   this   constitutional
imperative of ensuring that this diversity in culture  and  in  language  is
given some impetus through funding by the fiscus. It is  the  responsibility
of all of us to ensure that when that is done, such funds are  used  not  to
suppress competition, not to suppress diversity or views,  but  in  fact  to
make those things flourish.

I  would  like  to  thank  all  members  for  having  supported  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution (Democratic Party dissenting).

The Council adjourned at 19:57.

                          THURSDAY, 7 NOVEMBER 2002

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:
