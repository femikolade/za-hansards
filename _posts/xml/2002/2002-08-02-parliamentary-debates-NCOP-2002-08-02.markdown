                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I give notice that  I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the New NP was shocked and cannot accept the violation  of
       the SA Constitution by Transnet through the adoption  of  a  language
       policy that ignores the language realities of South  Africa,  as  was
       reported in Die Burger of 26 July;


  (2) notes that by the adoption of this policy, the language rights of the
       speakers  of  isiXhosa,  Afrikaans,  Xitsonga,  Tshivenda,   isiZulu,
       Setswana and all the other indigenous languages are ignored, and this
       cannot be tolerated by any of these language communities;


  (3) also notes that the New NP expresses its gratitude  for  the  efforts
       that presiding officers of the NCOP took to ensure that our  meetings
       here in Umtata are  conducted  in  isiXhosa,  with  the  professional
       interpretation services of  Hansard,  in  the  person  of  Mr  Hector
       Tshabalala. It would have been totally out of rhythm and  ineffective
       if the meetings had been conducted in English only, while we  are  in
       the heart of the Xhosa community of South Africa; and
  (4) further notes that people  must  be  empowered  in  and  through  the
       languages  they  know  best,  and  we  salute  the  Chairperson   for
       demonstrating the NCOP's commitment to multilingualism.

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) once more notes the  political  opportunism  of  the  Leader  of  the
       Opposition, the hon  Mr  Tony  Leon,  in  encouraging  the  Whittaker
       family, a member of which was murdered by one of the former prisoners
       given amnesty by the President, to sue the state for  the  individual
       action of the former prisoner;


  (2) believes that actions such as these  do  not  contribute  to  nation-
       building and reconciliation, but instead enhance racial polarisation;


  (3) calls upon Mr Leon to stop this  political  opportunism  and  embrace
       principles of nation-building and reconciliation.

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, I move without notice ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! We are dealing with notices of motion.

Mr N M RAJU: I thought I heard you say ``motions without notice''.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: No. [Interjections.] I am  glad  you  said  ``I
thought'', Mr Raju. I see the hon Lubidla.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, mine is also a motion without notice.

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  Perhaps  we  need  to  develop   different
terminology. Members often have difficulty with these terms. We are  dealing
with notices of motion.

Ms C BOTHA: Madam Chair, I give  notice  that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) sitting in the  province  which  produced  Steve  Biko,  regrets  the
       approach of the Minister for Justice and  Constitutional  Development
       in its resemblance to the statement by the then  Minister,  Mr  Jimmy
       Kruger, that the death of Biko left him cold;


  (2) notes that the utterances of the Minister seem very much in line with
       this when he says that they cannot foresee, and therefore seem not to
       care about, what happens when people are released on parole; and


  (3) asks that the Ministry reconsider the conditions under  which  people
       are pardoned and make them subject to a parole board investigation.

           performance of our athletes  at  the  Commonwealth  Games  2002,
           currently being held in Manchester, England; and


       (b)  that at the latest count, South Africa's medals tally stands  at
           26 medals, of which 10 are bronze, 10 are silver and 6 are gold;


  (2) further notes that among the gold recipients were -
       (a)  Mbulaeni Mulaudzi, who became South Africa's  first  gold  medal

       such joy and pride to South Africans.

                        DEATHS IN NORTHERN CAPE FIRE

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -

       Northern Cape, where a mother and child were caught up in a  fire  in

  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the achievements reached in the  signing  of  the  peace  accord
           between Rwanda and the DRC; and


       (b)  that these achievements are in line with the principles  of  the
           newly established African Union;


  (2) expresses its appreciation for the work done by African leaders; and


  (3) resolves to support all initiatives  directed  towards  the  peaceful
       resolution of all Africa's problems.

       APPRECIATION OF EFFORTS TO DIVERT FUEL OIL POLLUTION FROM NIÑO

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the  Council,  together  with  its  Select  Committee  on  Land  and
  Environmental Affairs -


  (1) commends the relevant authorities  and  entities  and  expresses  its
       appreciation more specifically to the masters and crews of  the  tugs

       successful efforts  over  the  past  few  days  to  divert  fuel  oil
       pollution from the vessel Niño, which ran aground off the Wild Coast;
       and

                             (Draft Resolution)

  That the Council-


  (1) wishes to congratulate Ernie Els on winning the most prestigious golf
       tournament in the world, the British Open;

       tournament;

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      NATURAL DISASTERS IN EASTERN CAPE

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, I have been  informed  that
there will be a short debate on  the  natural  disaster  that  affected  the
Eastern Cape recently. I call on the Chief Whip to address the House.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  the  Council  arrived  in  the
Eastern Cape in the aftermath of  a  devastating  snowstorm  and  rainstorm,
which were followed, shortly thereafter, by devastating fires. The  Council,
as did the President and the Premier and Cabinet of this  province,  extends
its sincere and heartfelt condolences to the  families  of  the  people  who
lost their lives in these disasters.

We are aware that the extent  of  the  disasters  was  so  grave  that  many
schools - more than six schools - more than 1 000 homes  and  more  than  50
businesses were  destroyed.  We  also  know  that  many  people  lost  their
businesses and, as a result thereof, their livelihood.

The extent of the damage to the infrastructure in these areas,  particularly
Cala, Indwe, Elliot and Ugie,  was  quite  bad.  A  few  days  ago  we  also
witnessed, to an extent, the devastation of  the  fires  in  Ntabankulu  and
part of Umzimkhulu.

It is interesting that approximately two and a half years ago  the  National
Council of Provinces hosted  a  conference,  a  national  and  international
conference, which dealt specifically with  natural  disasters  and  disaster
management. It was also the launching  pad  for  the  legislation  which  is
currently  in  the  National  Council  of  Provinces.  The  conference,   or
workshop, resulted in particular attention  being  paid  to  prevention,  to
mitigation, to reaction and to  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  in  the
event of disasters.
The Council notes the  very  swift  and  prompt  response  by  the  national
Government, through its Ministers who visited the sites  shortly  after  the
devastation, and the provincial government, whose representatives,  I  know,
have previously visited sites.  Yesterday  and  today  the  entire  Cabinet,
including the  Premier,  visited  the  far-flung  areas.  Local  government,
through the district municipality as well as councillors, was involved.

In other words, when this region was afflicted by this disaster,  all  three
spheres of government got together, co-ordinated their efforts  and  ensured
that  they  dealt,  in  a  very  significant  and  drastic  way,  with   the
difficulties that the people of the Eastern Cape were confronted with.

We also note that it is important that we recognise the efforts  of  the  SA
National Defence Force, which  has  done  sterling  work  in  the  past  and
continues to do so; the SA Police Service; all other  emergency  units;  the
disaster management units; the municipalities; the district councils;  other
organs  of  state;  and  civil  society,  with  various   corporate   bodies
assisting.

In terms of donations, thousands of rands' worth of food and sustenance  was
provided by companies and private individuals. There  are  many  stories  of
untold sacrifices that were  made  by  individuals  in  ensuring  that  they
assisted the people who were afflicted by this disaster.

We would like to urge the legislature and the  local  government  structures
to pay careful attention to this legislation. From 9 to  13  September  will
be a provincial week, and part of the  programme  of  that  provincial  week
involves the Disaster Management Bill. We do believe that it would  be  very
useful  and  helpful  if  public  hearings  were  held  in  the   provincial
legislatures and possibly  in  district  councils,  where  the  thoughts  of
people could be taken into account to shape the legislation.

We also believe that as we extend our  condolences  to  the  people  of  the
Eastern Cape, we should not forget  those  who  were  affected  in  KwaZulu-
Natal, the Western Cape, the Free State and Mpumalanga,  and  we  note  with
pride that these areas are going to be visited. Just yesterday the  Minister
for Provincial and Local Government, the Minister for Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs and the MEC visited the  areas  that  had  been  devastated  by  the
fires. The response of the people of  the  Eastern  Cape  has  been  a  very
positive one of  hope  and  contentment.  We  believe  that  they  have  the
resilience, as they have shown in the past, to deal with this disaster,  and
we wish them well. [Laughter.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, at the time when I moved from the  city  to
the rural areas of the Northern Cape some years ago, the  temperature  there
was about 43 degrees Celsius. A wise old man came up to me and asked,  ``How
are you doing?'' and I immediately complained about the temperature  in  the
Northern Cape. The wise old man asked me if I could change it, and  I  said,
``No, I cannot''. And he said, ``You cannot change  the  weather,  so  don't
complain about it''.

We cannot change the fact that natural disasters will  happen,  but  we  can
make a difference to the effects of the disasters. We  can  also  change  or
prevent disasters caused by human error, such as  carelessness  or  criminal
actions, and this must be done. Let me give a few examples.

When people build houses in areas that are known for  heavy  rainfall,  such
as the Cape Flats in the Western Cape, it is important that those houses  be
built above the water or flood line.

Secondly, farmers must take preventative measures during the dry seasons  so
that if a fire breaks out, it is limited to a specific area.

Thirdly, the general public and workers must be informed about  the  dangers
of open fires, of being reckless with cigarette butts -  if  we  still  have
smokers amongst us. They must be informed  especially  about  the  hardships
caused by runaway fires, as happened in the Free  State,  KZN  and  here  in
this province in Ntabankulu and Umzimkhulu.

On behalf of my party, I also  want  to  thank  Minister  Mufamadi  and  his
Deputy,  as  well  as  Minister  Thoko  Didiza,  for  visiting  these  areas
yesterday to assess the damage and the hardship suffered by the people.

I also want to convey on behalf of my party condolences to  the  people  who
are suffering as a result of these fires. However, we as civil society  must
not just wait for the national Government or provincial legislatures  either
to assist after a disaster or to train or inform the public at large,  since
more should be done from these quarters.

My party feels very strongly that the authorities have a responsibility  and
must get involved and must assist. However, we  as  representatives  of  the
people and members of civil society must also get involved by educating  our
children and communities, and talking to our families and  friends,  thereby
minimising the effects of disasters.

We must take responsibility for managing disasters. United  we  can  make  a
difference. [Applause.]
Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, there is very little to  add  to  the  sentiments
expressed by Mr Surty, which we fully subscribe to. I wish to add,  however,
that the DP condemns the reports of callous looting  that  took  place  when
ice and snow marooned many villages and towns in the Eastern Cape.  We  wish
to contrast this with the selfless attitude of many South Africans  who  did
more than was expected of them to provide  food,  clothing  and  relief  for
those afflicted by the natural disaster.

We also wish to extend our condolences to all victims of any natural or man-
made disaster. My constituency in the North West, around  Mafikeng,  Zeerust
and Lichtenburg, was  badly  afflicted  by  runaway  veld  fires,  and  many
communities from all  walks  of  life  and  all  ethnic  groups  were  badly
affected by this. We as South Africans must learn to rally around  and  help
all,  regardless  of  who  has  been  afflicted  by  any  natural  disaster.
[Applause.]

Mr M  J  BHENGU:  Sihlalo,  njengoba  bethi  nginguMahlangu  nje  namhlanje,
ngikholwa ukuthi nezinyanya zakwaBhengu  zixakekile  nazo  ukuthi  sengijike
nini ngaba uMahlangu ngoba ngicabanga  ukuthi  abakwaBhengu  nabakwaMahlangu
akukho lapho behlangana khona.

Ngisukumela ukusho ukuthi thina  beNkatha  Freedom  Party  sidabuka  kakhulu
ukubona  izimo  lezi  ezehlele  isiFundazwe   sase-Eastern   Cape   njengoba
siwubonile umlilo, izimvula kanye neqhwa. Sibonile nendlela  izilwane  ezife
ngayo njengezinkomo, izimbuzi  kanye  nezimvu,  okuyinto-ke  thina  Abenguni
ikakhulukazi nabanye nje base-Afrika esiziqhenyayo ngayo ngoba nxa  uyindoda
ungenankomo futhi ungenambuzi kuyaye kube sengathi awusiyo indoda ephelele.

Sidabuka  kakhulu,  ikakhulukazi  ngalaba  bakithi  abamnyama  abangabalimi,
ngento esiyibonile. Siyakholwa-ke nokho ukuthi  bakwethu  uHulumeni  omkhulu
kukhona azokwenza njengoba sibonile izolo kumabonakude  ukuthi  oNgqongqoshe
sebefikile lapha eMtata ukuzobona le nhlekelele futhi  kukhona  abazokwenza.
Sithi-ke  akwehlanga  lungehli.  Sengathi  uNkulunkulu  angaba  nabo  abantu
balapha  e-Eastern  Cape,  kulunge   konke   lokhu   okonakele.   [Ihlombe.]
(Translation of Zulu speech follows.)
[Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, as they call me Mahlangu today,  I  believe  my
ancestors are being confused by the fact that I have changed to Mahlangu.  I
think there is no relationship between the Bhengu and the Mahlangu clans.

I have risen to say that we, as the Inkatha Freedom Party,  are  very  sorry
about the natural disasters that took place in the  Eastern  Cape  province,
as we have seen fire, rain and snow. We have seen how the livestock such  as
cattle, goats and sheep died. The Nguni and other African  people  derive  a
sense of pride from their livestock, and if a man does not  have  cattle  or
goats, it seems as if his manhood is incomplete.

We are very sorry, especially as far as the  black  farmers  are  concerned,
about what we witnessed. We believe that the national  Government  is  going
to assist in whatever way it can, as we have seen  on  television  that  the
Ministers have arrived in Umtata to see this disaster  for  themselves.  May
God be with the people of the Eastern Cape province, and may  they  be  able
to fix everything that has been damaged. [Applause.]]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Madam Chair, I rise on behalf  of  the  UDM  to  join  other
political parties in their condolences for  people  affected  by  disasters.
There is no need for me to repeat the incidents of disasters  already  cited
by the Chief Whip. It is against this  background  that  the  need  for  the
establishment of disaster management committees  at  regional  and  district
levels cannot be overemphasised.

The recent cold-related disaster has further signalled  the  need  to  equip
municipalities with adequate skills and equipment to manage effectively  the
consequences of whatever natural disaster may occur.

Briefly, the UDM wishes  to  express  its  condolences  and  would  like  to
associate itself with those families, especially the survivors who are  left
traumatised by this particular winter disaster. We hope  that  the  Almighty
will support the spirits of these families and that, at the end of the  day,
people  will  forget  this  disaster  and  continue  with  life  as  normal.
[Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Madam Chairperson, hon members of the  House  and  our  hon
countrymen of the Eastern Cape, on behalf of  the  UCDP  I  hereby  wish  to
express our greatest sympathy with our  Eastern  Cape  countrymen  who  have
recently been affected by natural disasters. We are aware that  some  people
have lost their loved ones, and others have  lost  their  possessions  which
are their means of livelihood. However, we hope  that  after  the  necessary
investigations and assessments of the extent of the  damage  and  loss,  the
Government will do something to meet  those  who  suffered  losses  halfway.
Above all, we can only commend those who have been afflicted  to  the  mercy
of the Almighty Father above. [Applause.]

                      NATURAL DISASTER IN EASTERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, the parties and  the  provincial
Whips have got together and drafted a resolution after  this  short  debate.
With your permission, may I read the resolution for adoption by this  House?
I am sorry it was not clearly indicated. It is indicated  in  the  speakers'
list, but not clearly enough.

Thank you for indulgence, Chairperson. Before I proceed to read the  motion,
may I also mention that yesterday the President declared the areas of  Cala,
Indwe, Elliot, Ugie and Barkely West disaster  areas.  We  thought  that  we
would let the people know.

I move without notice a resolution that has been agreed to by all  political
parties and all provinces, as follows:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes into account the fact that natural disasters affect the  health
         and well-being  of  human  beings,  in  particular  those  who  are
         vulnerable due to socio-economic factors such as poverty;


  (2) notes -


         (a)     with concern the very large number of lives that have  been
              lost, the great extent  of  material  damage  to  agricultural
              livestock and crops and the adverse impact on the  environment
              left in the wake of the recent snows, storms  and  devastating
              fires;


         (b)     the inherent danger of floods as a result  of  the  melting
              snow, the impact of this  on  social  infrastructure  such  as
              transport, housing and education and the fact  that  it  could
              potentially  affect  everybody  from  commercial  to  emerging
              farmers and workers; and


         (c)     the devastation to life, property and stock caused  by  the
              recent veld fires;


  (3) commends local provincial and national governments  for  their  swift
         response and intervention in dealing  with  natural  disasters  and
         for  the  work  they  accomplished  in  helping  to  mitigate   the
         consequences of the disaster for the people living in these areas;


  (4) expresses its deep appreciation for the efforts  of  non-governmental
         organisations,  individuals,  companies  and   others   that   have
         generously provided financial,  technical  and  other  support,  as
         well as substantial  contributions  in  raising  awareness  of  the
         plight of victims;


  (5) believes that -


         (a)     in order to achieve sustainable human  development,  it  is
              critical to adopt policies and strategies  aimed  at  reducing
              vulnerability as an integral part of  developmental  planning;
              and


         (b)     the challenge of  reducing  the  impact  of  all  kinds  of
              disaster is permanent and requires a consistent  institutional
              framework at the local, provincial and national levels;


  (6) recalls that -


         (a)      pertinent  issues  were  raised  and  discussed   at   the
              international workshop on disaster management  hosted  by  the
              National Council of Provinces; and


         (b)     the National Council of Provinces  dedicated  part  of  its
              provincial visit to  briefings  and  discussions  on  the  new
              Disaster Management Bill;


  (7) acknowledges that national institutions  responsible  for  prevention
         and mitigation, as well as those  in  charge  of  preparedness  and
         emergency management, need further strengthening and must  also  be
         guaranteed functional continuity through  adequate  human  resource
         development;


  (8) urges Government to ensure that the rehabilitative aspect of disaster
         management, which includes compensation, is timeously executed;


  (9) recognises that -


         (a)     the  Disaster  Management  Bill,  which  will  bring  about
              qualitative  improvements  in  the   country   by   increasing
              awareness of the  importance  of  reducing  vulnerability  and
              mitigating the effects  of  natural  disasters,  is  currently
              before the NCOP; and


         (b)      it  is  critical  for  civil  society   to   be   involved
              effectively in this process of  shaping  the  legislation  and
              participating in the envisaged  mechanisms  reflected  in  the
              Bill; and
  (10)     therefore supports the calls for the development of  a  national
         culture of  prevention  and  mitigation,  education,  training  and
         dissemination of  information  at  all  levels  and  the  effective
         participation of civil society in such programmes.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   REINSTATEMENT OF ENROLMENT OF CERTAIN DECEASED LEGAL PRACTITIONERS BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Security and
                       Constitutional Affairs thereon)

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Chair, before I commence with the formal part of  my  address,  may  I  take
this opportunity to congratulate the presiding  officers,  the  Chief  Whip,
the hon members and the officials of the NCOP on this important initiative.
As hon members might recall, I was deployed in the Senate in 1994, and  from
the first day we struggled with our role and how to  make  it  real  to  the
people who had given  us  this  important  work  to  do.  Hon  members  have
crystallised this in a meaningful and substantive way. I believe this is  an
initiative that should be applauded and encouraged.

I know how difficult it must have been to get the NCOP's infrastructure  and
members down here, and I suspect that there are going to be  provinces  that
will be even more difficult to visit. The endurance and  enthusiasm  of  hon
members are to be applauded, and to all of them I say a great  big  ``Wow!''
[Applause.]

Madam Chair, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, while this is a  short  Bill,
I believe that we must not  lose  sight  of  the  profound  implications  of
passing this historic legislation. The Bill came about as a  result  of  the
need  to  honour  the  memory  of  those  legal  practitioners  who  made  a
contribution to the opposition of apartheid, or  who  assisted  persons  who
were opposed, and were struck off the roll because  of  such  opposition  or
assistance.

The Bill, in a symbolic manner, attempts to redress the  injustices  of  the
past suffered by these and  other  anti-apartheid  lawyers  who  have  since
passed away. The integrity and bravery demonstrated by  these  icons  should
serve as an inspiration to all existing and  aspiring  legal  practitioners.
This Bill acknowledges their efforts and honours their legacy.

The Bill provides that the name of any deceased person who was removed  from
either the roll of advocates or the roll of attorneys prior  to  April  1994
may, by way of application to the High Court, be reinstated on the  roll  in
question.  The  Bill  will  set  the  record  straight  by   restoring   the
professional status of those legal practitioners who were removed  from  the
roll during the apartheid era.

It is about time that we gave recognition to those people  who  played  this
particularly significant role in our history. The names of  these  activists
and what they represent should inspire all  of  us  to  try  harder  in  our
efforts to improve the lives of all in South Africa, particularly the  poor,
the marginalised, the disabled and the weak.

In 1997, former President Mandela said:


  The names of only very few people are remembered beyond their lives.  And
  some of those are remembered with revulsion for the harm they have  done.
  But there are those who are remembered  for  their  good  deeds  and  the
  contribution they have made to the society in which they live.

The question must be asked, ``Who precisely is  this  Bill  aimed  at?''  My
department is aware of the following activists, who have since passed  away,
who were struck off the roll: Bram Fischer, who was struck off the  roll  of
advocates, while Lewis Baker and Shun Chetty were struck  off  the  roll  of
attorneys.  As a matter of interest,  hon  members  will  remember  that  an
attempt was made to strike the names of Joe Slovo and  Duma  Nokwe  off  the
roll, but they had gone into exile. 

An application was even brought against our former President Nelson  Mandela
in 1954 by the then Transvaal Law Society to strike his name  off  the  roll
of  attorneys,  but  he   successfully   defended   the   application. Judge
Ramsbottom, in his judgment, stated that nothing Mandela had done  reflected
upon his character or showed him to be unworthy to remain in  the  ranks  of
an honourable profession.

The Reinstatement of Enrolment of Certain Deceased Legal Practitioners  Bill
will attempt to ensure that the reinstatement of those lawyers  who  took  a
stand against apartheid, from which we are now all reaping the benefits,  in
some measure redeems the honour of the  legal  profession  whose  reputation
was immeasurably tarnished by these events.

I propose this Bill with an absolute sense of  pleasure  and  the  certainty
that it will be unanimously supported. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, at one of the meetings I  addressed  in  my
constituency, I posed this  question  to  people  in  attendance:  Is  there
anything nicer than democracy? The answer was an unanimous no.  Many  people
contributed to making sure that we achieved democracy. Some of these  people
were attorneys or advocates. They were more than ready and prepared  to  put
their professions at stake, rather than compromise their beliefs.

Indeed, it happened. They were suspended, expelled, struck off the roll  and
denied the opportunity to make a living.  They  could  no  longer  represent
their clients in courts. They could not use their profession, at which  they
toiled like the proverbial miner, while their companions were still asleep.

I am referring to those individuals who inspired many people  of  all  races
who had identified themselves with our  struggle.  Amongst  them  were  none
other than these esteemed patriots: Bram Fischer, Shun Chetty, Oliver  Tambo
and Bantu Steve Biko. This  Bill  provides  for  the  reinstatement  of  the
enrolment of legal practitioners, since deceased, who were  struck  off  the
roll of advocates or attorneys as a result of their opposition to  apartheid
or who legally assisted persons who were so opposed.

Bram Fischer, after whom this Bill is sometimes named, was born in 1908  and
was the son of a judge president of the Orange Free State and grandson of  a
prime minister of the Orange River Colony. He became  a  Rhodes  scholar  at
Oxford. On qualifying as a barrister, he practised in Johannesburg where  he
was elected to the bar council and for some years was  its  chairperson.  As
queen's counsel, he led  the  defence  in  a  number  of  political  trials,
including the treason trial from 1956-1960 and the Rivonia trial from  1963-
1964.

In September 1964, he was arrested and  charged  under  the  Suppression  of
Communism Act. Having been briefly granted bail to argue a case  before  the
Privy Council in London, he returned to South Africa to stand trial.

On 25 January 1965 he went underground to continue the struggle and did  not
attend his trial. Instead, he sent a letter to his counsel,  Herold  Hanson,
which was read out in court. For the benefit of our country as a whole,  for
those who did not have an opportunity to read that letter or to follow  what
transpired that day, let me quote what he wrote:


  By the time this reaches you I shall be a long way from Johannesburg  and
  shall absent myself from the remainder of the trial. But I shall still be
  in the country to which I said I would return when I was granted bail.


  I wish you to inform the court that my absence, though deliberate, is not
  intended in any way to be disrespectful. Nor is it prompted by  any  fear
  of the punishment which might be inflicted on me. Indeed I realise  fully
  that my eventual punishment may be increased by my present conduct.

The letter continues:


  My decision was made only because I believe that it is the duty of  every
  true opponent of this government to remain in this country and oppose its
  monstrous policy of apartheid with every means in his power. That is what
  I shall do for as long as I can.

The letter goes on:


  There are already over 2 500 political prisoners in  our  prisons.  These
  men  and  women  are  not  criminals  but  the  staunchest  opponents  of
  apartheid.


  If by my fight I can encourage  even  some  people  to  think  about,  to
  understand and to abandon the policy they now so blindly follow, I  shall
  not regret any punishment I may incur.


  I can no longer serve justice in the way I have attempted  to  do  during
  the past 30 years. I can do it only in the way I have now chosen.

For saying what he said in that letter, Bram Fischer was declared  an  enemy
of the state. For saying what he said, he  was  struck  off  the  roll.  The
contribution of Bram Fischer and other  officers  of  the  courts  who  were
opposed in the same way will live on. Bram Fischer  wanted  a  better  South
Africa for all South Africans. He compromised and sacrificed his  profession
so that you and I could enjoy the democracy which we are enjoying today.

Let us restore that dignity. Let us pass this Bill. Family members of  these
people who were struck off the  roll  because  of  their  political  beliefs
cannot wait to celebrate this day.

The committee members demonstrated once more that when it comes  to  serious
issues, they are able to rise above party politics and  play  the  ball  and
not the man. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. I  support  the
Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, a few people  might  say  that  there  is  little
purpose in reinstating the  name  of  a  deceased  person  to  the  roll  of
practitioners. To those people I would say that this  Bill  provides  for  a
gesture that is important in a number of respects.

Firstly, for the family and memory of the deceased practitioner,  it  allows
the deceased's name and professional status to be restored. Secondly, it  is
an acknowledgement of  the  role  that  the  deceased  may  have  played  in
securing a democratic future for all South  Africans.  It  is  important  to
acknowledge this role in order to advance  the  process  of  reconciliation,
nation-building and healing the wounds of the past.

Thirdly, the professional body may, after consultation with  the  deceased's
family, apply to  have  the  deceased's  name  reinstated  to  the  roll  of
practitioners. This would allow the professional body concerned  to  examine
the role it played in having the deceased's name struck off  the  roll  and,
in appropriate cases, seek to make amends by  engaging  the  family  of  the
deceased  and  initiating  the  process  of  having  the   deceased's   name
reinstated.
Despite the fact that there are names that I am burning to mention,  I  have
refrained from naming  potential  candidates  to  be  reinstated  because  I
believe that for a gesture of this sort to have greater meaning  and  value,
it should be spontaneous and unprompted. The deceased persons  to  whom  the
Bill may  apply  are  not  so  far  removed  from  living  memory  that  any
professional body would need prompting.

I would urge the professional bodies concerned to draw their records on  the
relevant cases and to reflect on the role that their professional  body  may
have  played  in  having  the  deceased's  name  struck  from  the  roll  of
practitioners. An application to reinstate the deceased  legal  practitioner
to the roll of advocates or attorneys is not confined  to  the  professional
body concerned, but I hope that the  organisations  concerned  will  do  the
right thing where the circumstances and facts of a particular  case  warrant
it.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK:  Agb  Voorsitter,  ek  lewer  vandag  hierdie  toespraak
namens kollega Piet Matthee wat siek is. Hy is deur sy dokter  aanbeveel  om
nie  hier  te  wees  nie.  Dit  is  vir  my  'n  voorreg  om  dit  te  doen.
[Chairperson, I deliver this  speech  today  on  behalf  of  colleague  Piet
Matthee who is ill. His  doctor  advised  him  not  to  be  here.  It  is  a
privilege for me to do it.]

This Bill came about, as  we  have  heard,  as  a  result  of  the  need  to
recognise  the  important  contributions  made  by  deceased  anti-apartheid
lawyers who were struck off the roll for their anti-apartheid activities.

The Bill, in a symbolic manner, attempts to redress the  injustices  of  the
past suffered by these  and  other  lawyers  who  have  since  passed  away.
[Interjections.]  Maybe  members  should  listen  and  then  become   really
democratic.

In an article in The Star dated 30 November 2001, the national  director  of
Lawyers for Human Rights is quoted as saying that the Bill sets  the  record
straight and gives recognition where it is long overdue. He goes on  to  say
that idealistic and brave indidivuals like these need to  be  remembered  in
order that we set new yardsticks,  new  standards  for  the  young  aspiring
public interest lawyers. Mr Raju has listened, I presume.

The article goes on to quote political analyst Jakkie  Potgieter,  who  says
that a lot of pre-1994 history has been engineered to such  an  extent  that
few people know what people have done to unite us and to make  relationships
between different races normal. It is time  to  give  recognition  to  these
people who played an important role in our history.

The question may be asked:  At  precisely  whom  is  this  Bill  aimed?  The
department has informed us, as has the Deputy Minister, that it is aware  of
Bram Fischer, who was struck off the roll of advocates, and of  Lewis  Baker
and Shun Chetty, who were struck off the roll of attorneys.

As I know more about the late Adv Bram Fischer, QC, than the  other  lawyers
mentioned earlier, I will say something  more  about  him  only.  He  had  a
distinguished law career in which he worked closely with Nelson Mandela  and
others in the pursuit of social justice. From 1956 to 1961  he  participated
in the defence of 156 individuals accused of  treason.  In  1964,  at  great
personal risk, he led the defence of Nelson Mandela and  his  co-accused  in
the infamous Rivonia Trial. By 1965 Fischer was himself a fugitive from  the
law,  evading  the  police  for  10  months  underground  and  in  disguise.
Eventually he was captured  and  sentenced  to  life  imprisonment.  He  was
released from jail in 1975, only because he was dying of cancer.

After Fischer had announced on  21  January  1965  that  he  had  chosen  to
forfeit his bail and leave his home in  order  to  continue  the  liberation
struggle from underground, he sent an open message from somewhere  in  South
Africa in which he stated, inter alia:


  As we know from history - including the history of South Africa - if  the
  struggle for freedom is smothered in one place or for the time being,  it
  flares up again before long.

The message continued:


  But, most important, is the extension of human rights  to  all  citizens.
  Democracy will eventually be won, of that there  can  be  no  doubt.  The
  question is whether it can be achieved peacefully or only by violence.

He went on to say:


  A peaceful transition can be brought about if the  Government  agrees  to
  negotiation with all sections of the people ...

Although he then stated that  the  ``prospects  of  such  negotiations  seem
desperately remote'', he carried on:


  If the combination of predictable and unpredictable forces leads to large-
  scale violence or war, the consequences would be so disastrous in loss of
  life, in suffering, in economic disruption, in a legacy of bitter  hatred
  and in the threat to  world  peace,  that  I  believe  that  white  South
  Africans must at some stage be brought to realise that  their  own  long-
  term interests lie not in maintaining race  supremacy  but  in  extending
  human rights to all.

And fortunately this did happen under the leadership of F W de Klerk.

He concluded with a wish and a dream about the future  of  our  country,  in
the following words:


  With all South Africa free, at long last  our  country  will  fulfil  its
  great  potential  -  economic,  political,  cultural  and  educational  -
  internally and in African and world affairs.

Let us honour the memory  of  the  late  Adv  Bram  Fischer  and  the  other
deceased lawyers like him, not only by  unanimously  supporting  this  Bill,
but also by doing our utmost to ensure that  the  wish  and  dream  of  Bram
Fischer for our country - which for me is representative of the  dreams  and
wishes of so many South Africans - truly becomes and remains a  reality,  so
that, now that all South Africa is free, our country does indeed fulfil  its
great potential, internally and in African and world affairs. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, yesterday, when Ms Majodina  and
I were speaking to each other, she indicated to me that this  district,  the
O R Tambo district, had delivered. It had delivered to this nation not  only
Nelson Mandela, but also O R Tambo. They constituted the  first  black  firm
of attorneys established in South  Africa:  two  lawyers  committed  to  the
transformation of society, aspiring  to  social  justice  and  committed  to
equality, non-racialism and  non-sexism.  Those  were  the  aspirations  and
ideals cherished by these men.

As Mandela himself indicated, as the first firm of black lawyers, they  were
the firm of first choice and last resort. Unfortunately these two  academics
and lawyers were unable to ply their trade  because  of  their  beliefs  and
unwavering  convictions  and  their  commitment  to  social  transformation,
change, equality and non-racialism.
However, the question that  one  must  ask,  the  question  that  they  have
answered through their lives and dedication is: Is it worthwhile to  cherish
such ideals of democracy and non-racialism, notwithstanding  the  odds?  The
answer to that has  to  be  in  the  affirmative,  and  it  is  a  wonderful
coincidence that we gather here today in the O R Tambo district, a  district
which provided the ANC with two presidents,  one  towards  the  end  of  the
millennium and the other at the very end of the  millennium.  This  province
has now also provided us with a  president  in  the  new  millennium:  three
successive presidents presented to us by this region and this province  -  a
wonderful achievement.

It also indicates that  as  we  speak  to  each  other  in  this  university
institution, we should let  this  area,  its  geography  and  its  political
history be the incubators of social and political consciousness.

Yes, Nelson  Mandela,  Oliver  Tambo,  Govan  Mbeki  and  Thabo  Mbeki  have
succeeded in providing us with the rights that we  aspired  to  -  they  and
thousands and thousands of others who were committed to  the  liberation  of
this country. It is now the responsibility of the youth  of  our  people  to
ensure that we promote and fulfil those rights. Those rights, which we  have
now achieved, must be promoted and fulfilled.

The responsibility therefore lies with our youth  and  academics  to  ensure
that the judiciary that was so  biased  and  partisan  is  now  transformed,
becomes representative and democratic, and  embraces  the  ideals  that  our
leaders fought so hard for. That is the message and, in  fact,  it  is  with
great pride that I speak here today.

We have spoken about Bram Fischer and heard about him, and I  am  not  going
to repeat that. He was in the era of Nelson Mandela. Shun Chetty  was  there
when the United Democratic Front and its leaders were being  persecuted  and
prosecuted throughout the country. Those two lawyers and  others  like  them
committed themselves to the struggle.

I believe what we are doing here is not only giving solace  and  comfort  to
their families, but also reaffirming and restoring their dignity. It  is  an
affirmation of their integrity and the noble ideals  for  which  they  lived
and struggled. That is the message, the principle and  the  aspiration  that
we reflect here.

Nelson Mandela said:


  During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to the struggle of the African
  people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against
  black domination. I have cherished the ideal of  a  democratic  and  free
  society in which all persons live together  in  harmony  and  with  equal
  opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for  and  to  achieve.
  But, if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.

Before I conclude, I must say that there was  a  deafening  silence  by  the
organised legal profession during the time of the  struggle.  In  the  past,
for many decades, the dean of the faculty of law  of  Unitra,  for  example,
was not allowed to attend the University of Natal because of a quota  system
which prohibited the admission of more than five attorneys. These  were  the
difficulties. Black attorneys had no access to corporate and civil  work  or
to  institutional  support.  They  were  deliberately  excluded   from   the
mainstream of the legal profession.

As for my personal experience as a lawyer, at  my  first  meeting  with  the
president of the Law Society of South Africa  in  Rustenburg,  I  was  told,
``You are too young to practise as an attorney. We should  amend  the  rules
to allow people who are older to practise.'' The second thing he said to  me
was, ``You cannot practise in the city centre. You have to practise  in  the
group area that has been set aside for you.'' That was  my  introduction  to
the law. My introduction to a court of law  was,  ``Hierdie  hof  praat  nie
Engels nie - this court does not speak English.''

These were the kinds of manipulative tactics that were used  by  the  people
in the judiciary, people who represented the organised legal profession,  to
ensure that they excluded the blacks.

I refused to associate with  people  in  those  circles.  After  many,  many
years, when I had been embraced once they realised that they could not  wish
me away and felt that it was better to have me as a friend than a foe,  they
asked me why I did not join their  circle.  I  said,  ``How  can  I  join  a
profession that refuses to acknowledge that this council  refuses  to  allow
the public, the blacks, to attend its public amenities, and I am black?''

They decided to call a meeting to take a decision as to whether they  had  a
right to write to the council protesting about it. This was in  1988.  I  am
saying that during the period 1977 to 1994, no single white attorney in  the
region that I came from articled a black person. That  happened  only  after
1994.

The silence was deafening. The ability to  change  did  not  come  from  the
general body of white practitioners. I believe now  is  the  opportunity  to
restore their dignity and to ensure that they  make  their  contribution  to
transforming our society into a non-racial and non-sexist society  where  we
can live in harmony and where it does not matter whether  we  are  black  or
white. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Chair, thank you for this opportunity to reply. All has been said.  I  think
we are all elated by the passage of this Bill. It  can  only  make  us  feel
better about the past, if that is possible, but it gives us  an  opportunity
to look forward in unity and in recognition of the  diversity  which  is  so
much a part of us.

I think that the other thing I should say, is that there was an input  by  -
I think it was - the hon member Lever, who  exhorted  the  associations  and
legal societies not to wait for applications, but to respond out of a  sense
of decency and integrity and a wish to change  the  appalling  records  that
taint their past. I fully endorse this and I congratulate the hon member  on
putting that suggestion forward.
I thank all hon members very much for participating in this debate. It is  a
joyous occasion; it is a celebration of our freedom  and  democracy  and  it
honours those who made it all possible. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                          INSOLVENCY AMENDMENT BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Security and
                       Constitutional Affairs thereon)

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Chair, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the  Bill  that  lies  before  this
House is the product of a joint effort by the Department of  Labour  and  my
department. The House will forgive me for a  rather  technical  input;  they
are technical amendments, but they are exceedingly important amendments.  So
I will exhort hon members not to sleep and to listen with  both  ears  while
we go through the items.

In 1999 the Minister of Labour initiated an intensive review of  the  labour
laws, aimed at eliminating the abuse of workers,  and  of  their  impact  on
stimulating  job  creation.  After  extensive  consultations  with   various
stakeholders, those involved  in  the  review  process  concluded  that  the
policy fundamentals that shaped the laws were  sound,  but  that  adjustment
and refinements were required to, firstly, improve our  legal  framework  to
stimulate the creation of jobs; secondly,  address  unintended  consequences
of some provisions of  our  laws;  and  thirdly,  to  ensure  the  effective
alignment of our laws with the changing labour market environment.

In order to give effect  to  the  requirements,  the  Department  of  Labour
prepared draft amending Bills in respect of the  Labour  Relations  Act  and
the Basic Conditions  of  Employment  Act.  My  department's  role  in  this
important initiative was to prepare a  draft  amendment  to  the  Insolvency
Act. It is in the interests of the economy  and  society  as  a  whole  that
insolvency matters  should  be  resolved  fairly,  efficiently  and  without
delay.

The relevant draft amending Bills were published in the Gazette on  27  July
2000 in  order  to  solicit  comment  from  interested  parties.  Fifty-four
responses were received,  of  which  10  dealt  with  the  draft  Insolvency
Amendment Bill. The negotiations at Nedlac  began  in  September  2000,  but
were  subsequently  suspended.  A  process  of  bilateral   engagement   was
initiated between organised business and labour  in  the  Millennium  Labour
Council, or MLC. Negotiations were resumed in Nedlac in June 2001 after  the
MLC had concluded discussions  on  key  principles  in  respect  of  certain
aspects of the amending Bills. At the end of July agreement was  reached  at
Nedlac on the provisions of the draft Insolvency Amendment Bill.

Turning to the provisions of the Bill before the House today, it  should  be
noted that  the  Bill  contains  two  substantive  clauses  that  deal  with
sections 38 and 98A of the Insolvency Act. These sections apply both to  the
insolvency of individual employers who trade in their personal names and  to
companies and close corporations that are wound up because of insolvency.

Section 38 of the Insolvency Act at present provides that the  sequestration
of the estate of an employer terminates all contracts of employment  between
the employer and the employees. In contrast, section 37  of  the  Insolvency
Act provides that the leases entered into by the employer continue in  force
for three months from the date of sequestration unless they  are  terminated
by the trustee.

The termination of a contract of employment in terms of section 38 does  not
constitute a dismissal for purposes of the labour law. It is  classified  as
a termination  of  a  contract  by  operation  of  the  law.  Employees  are
consequently deprived of a range of protections, such as the  right  not  to
be unfairly dismissed in terms of the Labour Relations Act,  and  the  right
to severance pay in terms of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.
Clearly the present legal position does not strike a  fair  balance  between
the interests  of  creditors  of  an  insolvent  debtor  and  those  of  the
employees of an insolvent debtor. Consider this: Someone who has worked  for
the same firm for 15  years  is  told  without  any  consultation  that  the
company has been liquidated. It is a fait  accompli.  As  a  result  of  the
insolvency, all contracts of employment are terminated.

Clearly there is something wrong  with  that  situation.  One  of  the  main
purposes of the Bill under consideration is to  afford  employees  or  their
representatives an opportunity to consult with the liquidator of  a  company
in liquidation, or the trustee, to save or rescue the whole or part  of  the
business of an insolvent employer in order to save the jobs of employees.

Under the present  law,  claims  for  severance  and  retrenchment  pay  are
limited to claims in terms of a contract or  wage-regulating  measure  which
existed at the time of the liquidation. In cases  where  liquidation  occurs
without prior notice, there will probably not be any  claims  for  severance
and retrenchment pay in existence at the time  of  the  liquidation,  except
perhaps of course for some people in the know, like a managing  director  of
the  business.  The  Bill  affords  a  preferent  claim  for  severance   or
retrenchment pay if employment contracts are terminated as a result  of  the
liquidation of a company because of insolvency. The severance pay is for  at
least  one  week's  remuneration  for  each  completed  year  of  continuous
service, limited to  a  maximum  of  R15 000  per  employee.  It  is  clear,
therefore, that the Bill before us aims to  correct  fundamentally  what  is
essentially an unfair imbalance.

Clause 1 of the Bill therefore substitutes  section  38  of  the  Insolvency
Act. The new subsection (1) provides that  the  insolvency  of  an  employer
should only suspend obligations between employers and employees in terms  of
their contract of employment. Subsection (2) deals with the implications  of
such suspension, namely that employees  would  not  be  required  to  render
their services in terms of  their  contracts  and  employers  would  not  be
obliged to remunerate them. Despite the fact  that  contracts  of  employees
are suspended, employees will, in  terms  of  the  new  subsection  (3),  be
entitled to unemployment benefits in terms  of  the  Unemployment  Insurance
Act, subject to the conditions of that Act, and will therefore  be  entitled
to register for unemployment benefits as if they had been dismissed.

In terms of existing law, a trustee may engage the services of some  of  the
employees of the  insolvent  employer  to  continue  running  the  business.
Subsection (4) empowers the final trustee  to  terminate  the  contracts  of
service of the employees. The trustee may, however, in  term  of  subsection
(5),  not  exercise  this  power  unless  the  trustee  has   entered   into
consultations regarding measures that could be adopted to save the whole  or
part of the business with the employees, their trade  unions  or  any  other
representatives of the employees. In terms of subsection (8), a creditor  of
the insolvent employer may also participate in these consultations with  the
consent of the trustee.
Unless a trustee and an employee have agreed on  continued  employment,  all
contracts of service will, as a result of the operation of the proposed  new
section 38(9), terminate 45 days after the appointment of the final  trustee
or the equivalent time in the case of a close corporation.

It is generally accepted that employees whose services are terminated  as  a
result of insolvency are currently not entitled to the  statutory  severance
benefits provided for in section 41 of the Basic  Conditions  of  Employment
Act.  The  proposed  new  section  38(11)  provides  that  for  purposes  of
severance benefits these employees will be treated  as  employees  who  have
been dismissed because of the employer's operational requirements.

Clause 2 of the Bill effects a consequential amendment  to  section  98A  of
the Insolvency Act, which was enacted in 1998 to  improve  the  position  of
employees of an insolvent debtor. The claims for  severance  benefits  would
be against the estate of the  insolvent  employer,  which  is  regulated  in
terms of the new section 98A.
Before I conclude my input, Madam Chair ... I beg your pardon,  Sir.  Before
I conclude my input, Chairperson, I would like to  address  one  outstanding
matter. Nedlac agreed to amendments of sections 4 and 9  of  the  Insolvency
Act obliging a petitioner to give notice of a provisional  sequestration  of
a debtor's estate to trade unions and employees. These amendments  were  not
included in Bill 14B of 2002 as approved by the National Assembly, and  were
also not considered by Cabinet. I believe that a request  to  include  these
amendments in the Bill  has  been  submitted  by  the  National  Council  of
Provinces.

These amendments entail policy  issues  that  require  the  deliberation  of
Cabinet before they come  before  Parliament.  Indeed,  Cabinet  anticipates
that it could well consider additional and broader amendments  to  the  Act.
We thus believe that it would be more appropriate to  deal  with  these  and
other possible amendments in a separate Bill. The  Minister  will  introduce
this separate Bill as a matter of  urgency  after  the  policy  implications
have been thoroughly considered.
As hon members know, there is also  a  process  in  the  SA  Law  Commission
currently under way that could impact on this, and we  feel  that  we  could
come out with something far more holistic and with a policy  integrity  that
reflects our new labour law environment. I would prevail  upon  the  members
to convey this message to the interested parties.

This is not an attempt to delay or waylay efforts by employees  and  unions.
It is an attempt to retain the integrity of the legislation  that  we  pass.
We hate to amend legislation so soon after  it  is  introduced.  I  think  I
heard a lawyer say the acid test of good legislation  is  how  soon  or  how
late it is amended and how frequently. The less we do this, the  better.  We
would then like to introduce a separate Bill as soon  as  we  can,  and  the
Minister has placed a note of urgency on the matter with the department  and
has registered the same sense of urgency with the Department of Labour.

In conclusion, I would  like  to  extend  my  sincere  appreciation  to  the
chairperson of the  select  committee,  the  hon  Kgoshi  Mokoena,  and  the
members of that  committee  for  the  hard  work  they  have  put  into  the
consideration of this Bill.

Thank you once again, Chairperson, for giving me the opportunity to  present
this Bill to the House, and in this very special location. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I find myself in a difficult position  having  to
deal with a technical Bill after the hon the Deputy Minister  has  discussed
it in so much detail and so comprehensively. However, I hope  my  colleagues
and friends in this Council and the hon the Deputy Minister will forgive  me
if I merely make some very brief comments  and,  if  there  is  duplication,
will regard it simply as highlighting and summarising.

When a commercial undertaking goes insolvent, there  is  usually  a  web  of
conflicting and competing claims or rights to the proceeds of the assets  of
that insolvent organisation. Apart from a  relatively  small  group  of  so-
called secured creditors, usually nearly everybody involved loses  something
when  an  organisation  goes  insolvent.  The  amendments  to  the  law   of
insolvency in this Bill went through a process of negotiation in Nedlac.  In
essence, the amendments proposed  in  this  Bill  seek  to  provide  greater
equity to employees of the insolvent business concerned. They also seek,  in
the interests of retaining jobs and not losing jobs, which  are  a  precious
commodity in our economy at the moment, to  allow  for  efforts  to  save  a
business where a business or parts of a business may be saved.

I just wish to point out as well, regarding the  amendments  which  the  hon
the Deputy Minister referred to, that to the best  of  my  knowledge,  these
amendments were proposed by Nedlac after the committee  had  considered  the
Bill and must still be referred to Cabinet, in  which  event  they  will  be
referred back to us.

With those words, I wish  to  indicate  that  the  DP  supports  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, Deputy Minister for Justice  and  Constitutional
Development, colleagues and people of the Eastern Cape, please allow  me  to
say in the first instance ...

... egameni lombutho we-New NP sibulela ububele esamkelwe ngabo apha  eMpuma
Koloni. Sibulela ubuntu  benu,  sisithi  nangamso.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  [...  on
behalf of the New NP we are grateful for the kindness  with  which  we  have
been  received  here  in  the  Eastern  Cape.  Your  kindness   is   greatly
appreciated.] [Applause.]

In the second instance, allow me to express our appreciation to  the  office
bearers and staff of the NCOP for making possible this historic occasion  on
which we can meet the people who have placed us in office. I  am  sure  that
this is only the first occasion of this nature and that the other  provinces
will follow in the not too distant future.

After a review of the labour law in 1999, it  was  concluded  that  although
nothing was  wrong  with  the  policy  fundamentals,  some  adjustments  and
refinements were necessary to render  it,  inter  alia,  more  sensitive  to
employment creation.

As the Deputy Minister stated, this is  a  highly  technical  but  necessary
Bill. She has also very eloquently taken us through  the  various  intricate
clauses of the Bill, to the extent that if I went on, I would run  the  risk
of repeating what she has already said and boring hon members  with  details
they have already heard. I therefore conclude by stating that the Bill  does
not have any financial implications for the state, and that it is  supported
by the New NP. [Applause.]

Mntw B  Z  ZULU:  Sihlalo,  amalunga  ahloniphekileyo,  nani  nonke  beSilo,
sekukuningi   osekuchaziwe   kuleli   phuzu   lalo   mThethosisekelo    kulo
Mthethosivivinywa.  Sekungaba  kufishane  kakhulu  umuntu  angahle  aphawule
ngakho njengoba umuntu  engabe  esephindaphinda  lokhu  osekushiwo  yiSekela
likaNgqongqoshe wezoBulungiswa.

Inhloso enkulu yalo Mthethosivivinywa bekungukuvikela abasebenzi kanye  naye
umqashi. Abasebenzi balahlekelwe kakhulu esikhathini esiphambili  ngesizathu
sokuthi  uma  bedilizwa  laphaya  ezimayini  noma  emafemini  bebenganikezwa
ngisho  okuncane  ukuba  bona  baye  nakho  emakhaya.  Bekuthathwa  ngokuthi
inkampani leyo isiwile. Kodwa lo  Mthethosivivinywa  ukubeka  kucace  ukuthi
njengamanje  uma  inkampani  leyo  iphelelwa   izimali,   kuyofanele   ukuba
nabasebenzi babe nayo ingxenyana ethile abanikezwa  yona  okufanele  bahambe
nayo beye emakhaya.

Ngalawa  mazwi  amafishane  i-ANC   uwesekela   ngawo   wonke   amandla   lo
Mthethosivivinywa. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson,  hon  members,  Your  Majesties,  a  lot  has
already been explained about the relevance of the role of  the  Constitution
in this Bill. I will be brief and avoid repeating what the  Deputy  Minister
for Justice and Constitutional Development has already said.

The main objective of this Bill was to protect both  the  employee  and  the
employer. The employees lost a lot previously at  the  mines,  because  when
they were retrenched, they were not  given  retrenchment  packages  to  take
home. It was understood that the company has closed down. However, now  this
Bill puts it clearly that when a company is closing down,  employees  should
also get a share to take home.

In short, the ANC supports this Bill wholeheartedly.]

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, thank you very much to all the members and to all  the  parties
for supporting this important piece of legislation. Of course, at the  heart
of this Bill lies an attempt  to  give  the  workers  of  this  country  the
dignity they deserve,  the  dignity  accorded  to  them  in  our  incredibly
wonderful document, the Constitution. Maybe  it  is  through  this  kind  of
legislation  that  we  turn  that  Constitution  into  a  living,  breathing
document that affords people protection where required.

After a very technical discussion of this Bill, let me say that  it  is,  in
fact, possibly a celebration of the coming to life of our  Constitution  for
the workers and employees of our South African world. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

             CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF RULES COMMITTEE OF NCOP

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I am standing in  for  Mr  Moosa
who had to leave because he is going to receive an achiever's award. He  had
to be there in time and so, unfortunately, he is not here.

The statement that  I  would  like  to  make  relates  specifically  to  the
amendment of the Rules of the National Council of  Provinces.  I  am  indeed
grateful to see that the Speaker of the legislature is present.
One of the amendments that we dealt with concerned the issuing  of  mandates
where mandates could either be conveyed in writing or electronically, as  is
the practice right now. I thought it important that we raise  the  issue  of
mandates quite  critically  because  we  have  been  in  existence,  as  the
National Council of Provinces, for five years.  We  have  developed  a  best
practice in terms of how to  deal  with  mandates.  Therefore  we  urge  the
Council to look very seriously at the legislation which will deal  with  the
issuing of mandates.

As members are, no doubt, aware - the provincial Whips  in  particular  will
recognise this fact - the issuing  of  mandates  differs  from  province  to
province. KwaZulu-Natal has its own method in terms of its  own  rules,  and
the Eastern Cape's differs  from  that  of  KwaZulu-Natal  and  Gauteng.  We
believe that over the period, a particular practice has  crystallised  which
points provinces to a particular mandating approach that  seems  to  capture
all the essential elements.

We believe that this can  only  be  achieved  if  the  National  Council  of
Provinces  gets  together  with   its   counterparts   in   the   provincial
legislatures. That is the statement that I would like to make in  regard  to
mandates.

I would also like to say that the  importance  of  what  I  am  raising  has
relevance in the case that has been instituted  by  the  UDM  regarding  the
crossing-over legislation, in  which  the  procedure  has  been  challenged,
notwithstanding the fact that we had complied, in my opinion,  substantively
and materially with all the requirements in law. I thought that that was  an
important aspect to raise.

One final area to which we should, perhaps, pay attention is the  importance
of  the  participation  of  provincial  legislatures  in   the   two   joint
committees, those dealing with programming and Rules. Regarding Rules, I  am
referring to both the NCOP Rules Committee and the  Joint  Rules  Committee.
We do believe that the National Council of Provinces  represents  provincial
interests, and therefore a more  active  participation  by  provinces  would
really enhance the value of the institution. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  shall  now
put the question. The question  is  that  the  report  be  adopted.  As  the
decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the  Constitution,  I  have
to ascertain whether delegation heads are within the House.

I have just checked and I am satisfied that delegation  heads  are  present.
In  accordance  with  Rule  71,  I  shall  first  allow  the  provinces  the
opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they  so  wish.  Is  there
any province that would like to make a declaration of vote? I take  it  that
there is none.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the  question.  I  shall  do  this  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against  or  abstain  from  voting.

accordingly adopted.

          SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: AN INSTRUMENT FOR WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson - I see that the hon mayor has left,  as  has  the
whole  Salga  delegation  -  members  and  special  delegates,  it   is   no
coincidence that we are  having  a  debate  of  this  significance  in  this
province at the beginning of the month of August,  the  month  in  which  we
celebrate the achievements of women since our liberation in 1994.  Maybe  it
is also appropriate that one pays tribute to many of those women who  passed
on before seeing liberation. These  are  Lilian  Ngoyi,  Bessie  Head,  Ruth
First, Ida Mntwana and many others - too many to mention.
Since then, we have much to pride ourselves on: firstly, the recognition  of
all women's rights as human rights, and I refer members to section 9 in  our
Bill of  Rights  in  the  Constitution;  secondly,  the  criminalisation  of
violence against women - violence  against  women  is  now  an  illegal  act
punishable by law, and I refer members to the  Domestic  Violence  Act;  and
thirdly, the right of women to make a choice  on  their  reproductivity  and
method of contraception, and I refer members to the  Choice  on  Termination
of Pregnancy Act.

At the opening of the special session  of  the  General  Assembly  known  as
Beijing +5, which was just held in 2000, the  secretary-general  noted  that
despite all reported successes and achievements, much  still  needed  to  be
done  around  challenges  such  as  poverty  and  HIV/Aids.  My  input  will
therefore focus on these two areas.

The Constitution, in section 27(1), grants  everyone  the  right  to  health
care, food, water and social security. Poverty shows  in  various  different
ways: a lack of income and productive resources to ensure a  decent  living;
hunger and malnutrition; ill-health; limited or no access to  education  and
other  basic  services;   homelessness   or   inadequate   housing;   unsafe
environments; and social discrimination and exclusion.

Women's poverty is  increased  by  the  rigidity  of  gender  roles  in  our
society. This leads to women's limited access to education and training  and
productive resources. Women's  poverty  is  also  directly  related  to  the
absence of economic opportunities. The bulk of  the  unemployed,  more  than
50%, are women. Of course, poverty affects both men and women,  but  because
of gender divisions of labour and women's responsibility for  the  household
welfare, women bear a greater burden. Women have to manage  household  needs
under conditions of increased scarcity.

At least 35% to 40% of households are headed by women, and these  are,  more
often than not, much poorer than the average household  with  a  much  lower
per capita income compared to other households. It has also been found  that
the large number of these impoverished women live  in  rural  areas  of  our
country, and have little or no  access  to  electricity  or  clean  drinking
water, education and other social services.

The South African Government committed itself at the Beijing  conference  in
1999 to develop policies to  promote  the  equitable  distribution  of  food
within the household; to formulate and  implement  policies  in  support  of
female-headed households;  to  develop  and  implement  poverty  alleviation
programmes and projects; to enable women to obtain  affordable  housing  and
access to  land  by  removing  obstacles  to  access;  and,  with  the  full
participation of women, to promote policies  and  programmes  for  women  to
work towards the eradication of poverty.

Now, one would ask, what of the  Eastern  Cape?  The  Department  of  Social
Development has, to date, distributed an amount  of  R42,6  million  to  709
poverty alleviation projects throughout the Eastern Cape. More than  90%  of
these projects, we are told, have women as the target group.  They  include,
amongst others, food production, income generation  and  targeting  families
and households affected by HIV/Aids, which brings me  to  the  next  item  -
women and HIV/Aids.

It is no news that women bear the brunt of the HIV/Aids pandemic. They  have
to care for their children and partners who are dying,  they  are  the  ones
who get infected by their unfaithful partners, and they  are  the  ones  who
get raped and sexually abused because of their vulnerability.

One of the priority areas in the Beijing  +5  Platform  for  Action  is  the
response to the impact of HIV  and  Aids  on  women  and  girls.  The  South
African  Government  in  general,  and  the  Eastern  Cape   government   in
particular,  have  shown  their  commitment  to  this  priority  by   having
allocated an amount of R4,6 million from the Department  of  Health  and  R3
million from the Department of Social Development  to  home-  or  community-
based care programmes to date.  In  addition  to  this,  thousands  of  food
parcels are being distributed to  affected  families  and  households  on  a
monthly basis. Additional resources will also be allocated to  the  roll-out
of programmes for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission which  have
already been in operation for some time.

In conclusion, it is clear from the submissions we heard yesterday  and  the
days before that the social and economic upliftment of our people, women  in
particular, demands an intersectoral or interdepartmental response.  Poverty
is not just about the lack of financial resources;  it  is  also  about  the
lack of housing, water and sanitation, education, land and so on.  We  heard
the submissions yesterday. So, if we want to respond to poverty and all  its
manifestations adequately, we need a collective response from these  sectors
within Government and civil society, as well as the private sector.

Governments are elected to lead, but not in  isolation  from  their  people.
Governing is everybody's responsibility. It is only  when  Government  works
together with our people that we will succeed in building a better life  for
everybody. [Applause.]

Nksz  P  C  P  MAJODINA:  Mhlalingaphambili,   kukho   into   emnandi   ethe
yakhankanywa apha izolo nayizolo elinye  ethi:  ``Protocol  observed.''  Nam
nditsho.

Eli sebe sithetha ngalo sasisakulibiza njengeSebe lezeNtlalontle.  Namhlanje
eli sebe silibiza njengeSebe loPhuhliso loLuntu. Asifuni  ke  ukuba  libizwe
njengeSebe  lezeNtlalontle,  kuba  loo  nto  iya  kubangela   ukuba   abantu
bakowethu  bangakwazi  ukuziphuhlisa  nokuzenzela   nto,   bahlale   bejonge
enkalweni belinde imana eya kuhla eZulwini.

Ewe, umahluko omkhulu wenzekile ngokubhekisele  kuphuculo  lwempilo  yabantu
bakowethu. Siyavuma ukuba isekho imiqobo kwaye uphulaphulo lwezimvo  zoluntu
oluqhubeke apha kwezi ntsuku zimbini zidlulileyo  lusifundise  ukuba  uluntu
lunazo izikhalazo, izincomo kwaneemfuno esiza kuziqaphela ze  siziphonononge
xa sibuyele eKapa.

Mandiphefumle  ngokukhankanywe  nguMama  uLaura,  ukuba   abanabo   oogqirha
bezithili bokubaxilonga abantu bakowethu  ukuvavanya  imeko  yabo  yezempilo
ukuze  babe  nokufumana  izibonelelo.  Siza   kuba   nalo   igqugula   eliza
kubandakanya abongikazi, amagosa ezentlalontle nabameli boluntu ukuze  umntu
ofanele ukufumana isibonelelo ngaphandle kokubonana nogqirha  kuqala,  efuna
ukuba kuvunyelwane ukuba  uyimpula  kalujaca,  kufuneka  ancedwe  ngaphandle
kokuba sibe sijikeleza ngathi zizinja zifuna ukulala.

Impilo  engcono  nempucuko  azinakubakho   ukuba   ezi   zinto   zilandelayo
azinakuqwalaselwa  nzulu.  Okokuqala,  ukusetshulwa  neengcambu  kobuhlwempu
nendlala kubantu bakowethu; okwesibini, ukuliwa kwazo zonke izifo  esizibona
ziqhambuka   imihla   nezolo;   okwesithathu,   ingqwalasela    engagungqiyo
kuphuhliso  loomama;  okwesine,  ingqwalasela  ngakumbi  kulutsha  nakubantu
abakhubazekileyo; okwesihlanu, ukuvuselelwa kweedolophu zakowethu.

Iphondo leMpuma Koloni  liziqwalasele  zonke  ezi  zinto  ndizikhankanyileyo
ngasentla apha. Ngokubhekisele  kumasipala,  siyazi  ukuba  iZizi  elikhulu,
okaMbeki umntwana, uthe wazichonga iindawo emaziphuhliswe ngokukhawuleza.

Kukho amaphulo ambaxambini okuphuhlisa ngokupheleleyo  abasakhulayo  kwanabo
sele bekhulile. Apha  kwiSithili  songasekhoyo  uBawo  uTambo,  sinobungqina
obubambekayo   bolu   hlobo   lwamaphulo.   Phaya    eMbalisweni    sineziko
elisetyenziselwa   imicimbi   eyahlukeneyo   elijongene   neelali   ezili-18
eziyingqongileyo, kubandakanywa  iindawo  ezithile  zaseLibode  nezakuQumbu.
Kweli ziko kubhakwa izonka kuba oomama banaso isakhono,  kwaye  kuyathungwa.
Ndinxibe ndamhle ndanje, ndithungelwe kulo.

Kukwakho nemveliso  yezolimo  yokondla  abantu  bakowethu;  kunikwa  inkxaso
kubantu  abaphila  neNtsholongwane  kaGawulayo;  kuncedwa  abantwana  abathi
baxhatshazwe ze kuphononongwe zonke izicelo zezibonelelo.

Sinombutho wamafama owaziwa njengeLima Farmers Association  phaya  eDarhabe,
eMqanduli. Olu phuhliso ndithetha ngalo luphuhliso  olwenzeka  apho  sihlala
khona. Kukwafuywe iinkuku phaya, kuqhutywa izifundo zomthungo  kukwakhutshwa
nemveliso yezolimo.

Abona bantu baxhamlayo apha ngoomama  abangaphangeliyo,  lulutsha  olungekho
zikolweni  neempula   zikalujaca   jikelele.   Uqeqesho   luqhutywa   liSebe
lezeMisebenzi kwanelezoPhuhliso loLuntu.

SineNkqubo yoPhuhliso iMankosi  phaya  eNgqeleni.  Kanti  kukwakho  nenkqubo
yolondolozo lweenyosi. Abantu bale ndawo  abathi  xa  bebona  inyosi  babone
umabonw' abulawe kuba kufunwa  incindi,  kodwa  bathi  ezi  nyosi  mazihlale
zikhona kuba zilulutho kubo. Sithi koomama ze bayibambe njalo,  kuba  siyazi
ukuba ukuba ibanjwe ngabo, umntu othi uthinta umama uthinta imbokotho.

Umntu uthi xa eqhuba isithuthi edlula  ngohola  wendlela  u-N2  athi:  Kowu!
Olwa  sizana  lomama  luphaya  kulaa  ntsimi  luyahlupheka.  Nalu   lubeleke
umntwana emqolo. Asikokuhlupheka, koko yinkululeko exhanyulwa  ngulaa  mama,
inkululeko  eza  ngolu  hlobo.  Amaxa   amaninzi   ootata   bayahamba   baye
kuphangela, umama ashiyeke eyintloko yelo khaya, imanejala.  Uthi  eyintloko
yelo  khaya  abe  enguMphengululi-zincwadi  engakuqeqeshelwanga  oko.   Uthi
engumphengululi-zincwadi abe ngunondyebo, abale  yonke  le  mali  ithunyelwa
ngutata ukuze enze zonke iimfanelo zekhaya.

Uthi  akuba  enze  ezo  zinto  aqinisekise  ukuba  abantwana  baya   betyile
esikolweni,  kwanokuba  bayabuya  esikolweni  kwaye  bayaphumelela  ukuphela
konyaka. Kuthi ukuba  utata  ebeshiye  kukho  isitulo  esinye  sodaka  abuye
izitulo  zizihlanu  ekhaya.  Ngumama  ke  lowo  obonakala  engacinezelekanga
engqondweni. Xa ubani  ebona  umama  ehlakula  emasimini  ebeleke  umntwana,
sukuba  ebona  umama  ofuna  ukuqinisekisa  ukuba   uzuza   isivuno   esihle
engaxhomekekanga mntwini. [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of  isiXhosa  speech

[Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson,  there  is  a  beautiful  phrase  that  was
mentioned  here  yesterday  and  the  day  before  yesterday,  which   goes:
``Protocol observed.'' I reiterate it.

The department we are talking about used to be known as  the  Department  of
Welfare. Today we call it the Department of Social Development.  We  do  not
want it to be called the Department of Welfare, because that does  not  help
our  people  to  be  able  to  develop  themselves  and  to  do  things  for
themselves, but cause them to wait for manna to fall from heaven.

Yes, there has been a big improvement in the lives of our people.  We  agree
that there are still impediments, and the public  hearings  that  were  held
here over the past  two  days  have  taught  us  that  communities  do  have
complaints, proposals and needs, which we are going to consider and  analyse
when we are back in Cape Town.

Let me respond to what was mentioned by Mama Laura, that they  do  not  have
district surgeons to assess people's health so that those who are  deserving
can get grants. We are going  to  have  a  core  group  which  will  include
nurses, social service  officials  and  community  representatives  so  that
whoever is supposed to get a grant, and wants to be declared  needy  without
having to see a doctor first, can be helped in that regard  without  wasting
any time.

There can be  no  better  life  if  the  following  are  not  given  serious
consideration: Firstly, complete eradication of poverty and  hunger  amongst
our people; secondly, combating of all the diseases  that  break  out  every
day; thirdly, focused development of women; fourthly,  particular  focus  on
the youth and disabled people; and fifthly, urban renewal.

The Eastern Cape province has given consideration to all the aspects I  have
mentioned above. We know  that  as  far  as  municipalities  are  concerned,
President Mbeki, he of the Zizi clan, has identified  the  areas  that  need
urgent development.

There are two-pronged projects aimed at complete development  of  the  youth
and the elderly. Here in the district of the late Tambo,  we  have  concrete
proof of such projects. At Mbalisweni we have a  multipurpose  centre  which
services the surrounding 18 villages, including certain areas of Libode  and
Qumbu. It provides baking and sewing  services,  because  women  have  these
skills. I am well-dressed today because I bought my dress from the centre.

There is also an  agricultural  scheme  to  feed  our  people.  It  provides
support to people living with HIV/Aids, it provides  counselling  to  abused
children and it is where applications for grants are considered.

We have a farmers' association known as the  Lima  Farmers'  Association  at
Darhabe, in Mqanduli. I am  talking  here  about  development  at  community
level. Chickens are  raised  there,  and  sewing  lessons  and  agricultural
products are provided.

The beneficiaries of this development are the unemployed  women,  the  youth
who have left school and the poor in general. Training is  provided  by  the
Department of Social Development.

We have the Mankosi Development Project at Ngqeleni. There is  also  a  bee-
keeping project. People from this area do not kill  bees  for  their  honey,
because they are a source of help for them. We say to  the  women,  keep  it
up, because if one touches a woman, one touches a rock.

When one drives down the N2 and sees a woman, one might think:  Shame!  That
poor woman in that field is poor. She has a baby strapped on  her  back.  It
is not a case of being poor, but it reflects the  freedom  enjoyed  by  that
woman. In most cases men go to look for work  far  away,  leaving  women  to
head the home, as the manager. In addition to being the head  of  the  home,
she has to become an accountant without any training. On top  of  being  all
that, she has to become the treasurer, and take care of all the  money  that
is sent by the man so that she can fulfil all the household needs.

On top of all that, she has to make sure that  the  children  go  to  school
with something in their stomachs, that they come back from school  and  that
they pass at the end of the year. If the man left  the  household  with  one
earthen stool, there will be five  when  he  comes  back.  That  is  what  a
mentally unoppressed woman looks like. When one sees a woman hoeing  in  the
fields, with a child strapped on her back, one sees a  woman  who  wants  to
make sure that she gets a good harvest, without having to depend on  someone
else. [Applause.]]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, colleagues, friends, guests, the hand that  rocks
the cradle rules the world. This has been  true  since  the  early  days  of
mankind, and it will remain true for generations to come.

Women have always been the power behind the throne, but now  the  challenges
are to induce them to take a leading role in the  world,  a  role  which  is
fundamental to the development of a more effective and more humane  society.
This situation today goes beyond the  traditional  role  of  women,  and  we
rightly ask the question: At what price? We are still the nurturers  of  the
next generation. We still need the emotional  instinct  and  the  desire  to
procreate, and we still need the emotional satisfaction of  loving,  but  we
also need the intellectual satisfaction of getting to the top of our  chosen
field.
So today it is, on the one hand, required of women to  make  a  contribution
to the development of the country. It is the right of  women  to  take  part
actively in the affairs of the country as equal partners with men.  But,  on
the other hand, the country still needs the women to be the mothers  of  the
families.

What are the  requirements  for  women  to  be  equal  partners?  There  are
basically two requirements. Firstly, women must be allowed to be  equal  and
be given the opportunity to play a role. Secondly, women  must  be  equipped
to seize the opportunities so that we are ready to compete on equal terms.

Our Constitution provides for equal opportunities. Never in the  history  of
South Africa have the women of the country had the opportunities  they  have
today, or the choices. [Applause.] It depends on the woman  herself  whether
she will grasp an opportunity. Remember these 10 little words: If it  is  to
be, it is up to me. Nothing is impossible. You are  the  only  one  who  can
stand in the way of your dreams.
Where shall we start to equip ourselves? By developing  our  qualities.  The
qualities of a successful women  are  reliability,  consistency,  integrity,
loyalty to one's people, determination, being decisive  and  fair  and  well
organised; and then planning one's goals. Setting achievable  goals  is,  in
fact, an essential element in developing confidence and  self-assurance.  We
have to identify the skills we need. Everything is possible, so believe  it.
Firstly, one has to have an idea of what one wants to do. Secondly, one  has
to have the confidence to stick one's neck out and do it. Thirdly,  one  has
to have the determination to succeed and to stick with it through  the  lean
times. And, fourthly, one has to have the guts to throw  it  out  and  start
all over again.

We are  all  born  with  tremendous  genetic  potential.  We  have  so  many
potential skills that we have never had the time or opportunity to  develop.
We have so much brain power. Let me tell  hon  members  that  we  each  have
three hundred thousand million brain cells that are waiting to be tapped.
I know that out in the rural areas, with the  few  opportunities  there,  it
could  feel  that  it  will  always  remain  a  dream  to  be  a  successful
entrepreneur, politician, professional or whatever. Let me tell hon  members
that there are people out there who strive  for  the  advancement  of  human
rights and the status of women through  the  education  and  empowerment  of
women, socially, economically and politically. Soroptimists in South  Africa
- we call it Sisa - is but one organisation waiting to help  women  who  are
less privileged. Its members unite in a vision for a  better  tomorrow.  The
Sisa theme for the year is, and I  quote,  ``imagining  the  impossible  but
creating the  reality'',  and  Sisa  continuously  strives  to  improve  the
quality of life of people less privileged than ourselves.

The reason for Sisa's existence is to focus within its community  on  social
development,  economics,  education,  the  environment,  health  and   human
rights.  Sisa  wants  to  utilise  the  individual  skills,  knowledge   and
expertise of every woman to the benefit  of  those  in  need.  It  wants  to
become more proactive in shaping the future of women  and  children  in  our
country.

This society has a strong international voice and  access  to  international
funding. We need to make use of such an organisation  as  an  instrument  to
empower our women. Let us use Sisa, as it has offices all over  the  country
in all the provinces, and I can supply hon members with the names.

There is a well-known saying, and I quote: ``If ever the  time  should  come
when women band together for the good of humanity, it will be a  power  such
as the world has never known.'' Let it be time now  for  us,  the  women  of
South Africa, for our beloved country, to stand together. [Applause.]

Mnu H  T  SOGONI:  Mhlalingaphambili,  malungu  eBhunga  leSizwe  lamaPhondo
nabemi abahle baseMpuma Koloni, sithethile izolo nezolo elinye  ngentlaninge
yemithetho   equka   uMthetho   weSondlo   (Maintenance    Act),    uMthetho
ngoBundlobongela  baseMakhayeni  (Domestic  Violence  Act)  kunye  noMthetho
woLingano kwiNgqesho (Employment Equity Act). Yonke  le  mithetho  ibonakala
imihle,  ikulungele  ukubakhusela  abasetyhini   kuyo   nayiphi   na   imeko
yoxinzelelo nokungcungcutheka entlalweni abazifumana bekuyo.

Noxa  kunjalo  enye  yeengcali  zomthetho  ekhe  yenza  udlwabevu  lwentetho
ayiyicezelanga  inyaniso  ethi   `kusekude   engqinibeni'.   Ayikabinagalelo
libanzi nelivakalayo le  mithetho  ekugcineni  isidima  nesithozela  soomama
nomthinjana ngokubanzi kweli lizwe.

Umxholo wengxoxo yanamhlanje  wayame  ncakasana  ekuqwalaseleni  ubugxwayiba
bemeko yethu singoomama,  ukudlwengulwa  kwamalungelo  ethu,  nokungagcineki
kwiwonga  nomgangatho  wokuphila  osifaneleyo  esiwabelwe   nguMdali,   waza
waqinisekiswa nguMgaqo-siseko welizwe.

Isihloko  sengxoxo  yethu  sikwaqwalasela  inxaxheba  yeli  Sebe  loPhuhliso
loLuntu negalelo lalo ekumiliseleni amandla nesidima soomama,  intlalo  yabo
ibe  yefanelene  neyoomama  besizwe   esizingcayo   ngokulwela   nokukhusela
amalungelo abo bonke abemi ngokungenamkhethe nakucekisa.
Wayihlahla ke ifolo uMphathiswa weli Sebe  kwaNdlunkulu,  ugqirha  Skweyiya,
kwintetho yakhe yohlahlo lwabiwo-mali luka-2002 xa wayesithi, ndimcaphule,


  We still continue with our efforts to support  the  social  and  economic
  empowerment of women.

Ingxam yentetho kaGqirha Skweyiya iqamele kuphando olunzulu  oludize  ukuba,
ukuze  iphumelele  nayiphi   na   imizamo   yokuphuhlisa   intlalo   yoluntu
ngokubanzi, kuya kulunga ukuba imizamo leyo iqwalasele kuqala  imeko  yezona
mpula zikalujaca ekuhlaleni, ekubonakala ngokophando  ingoomama,  nakoomama,
ingoomama  bomz'  ontsundu,  basezilalini  nangoko.  Ngokuthelekisa  amanani
eengcali zophando  abasetyhini  abangekho  phantsi  kwengqesho  bangama-40%,
naxa  sele  kuthelekiswa  imivuzo,  abasetyhini  bamkela   ngokungama-   76%
ngaphantsi  kwabangamadoda.  Umnqa   ke   ngowokuba,   abasetyhini   baninzi
kunabangamadoda ngama-52%.

Yinyaniso engephikiswa bani intetho ethi ubuhlwempu nokuxhatshazwa  zisoloko
zingumtya nethunga. Ayisothusi  ke  ngoko  le  meko  igqubayo  yokunyathelwa
ngeenyawo kwamalungelo oomama, ngakumbi  abangamahlwempu.  Ayamkelekanga  ke
phofu,   kungoko   ke   ibekwe   ezithebeni   ifuna   izisombululo   ezizizo
nezigqibeleleyo.

Xa sisithi le meko icela umngeni kwiSebe loPhuhliso loLuntu,  asikuko  ukuba
sithi eli Sebe linazo zonke iimpendulo ngokusilela  kwabasetyhini.  Uxanduva
lokophula  isizwe  kwintsila  yeminyaka  yesiqhelo  esibi   alunakuze   lube
yimhemhe yesebe  elinye  kuphela.  Ndiyingqine  ke  ngoko  nembono  kaGqirha
Skweyiya xa ememelela uwonke-wonke  kwiphulo  lokuphuhlisa  intlalo  esithi,
ndimcaphula kwakhona,


  In achieving the objective of the ambitious programmes, we count  on  the
  support of many civil society partners.

Ngenene ke, nomphathiswa weli Sebe kweli phondo leMpuma Koloni  uyibethelele
naye into ethi yena nesebe lakhe phantse basemsileni kolo nxibelelwano  lude
lwentsebenziswano yamasebe ngamasebe  ngokunjalo  nezinye  izintlu  zolawulo
ezinendima ebalulekileyo ekuphumeleliseni idabi lamalungelo oomama.

Esona  sizathu  sibalaseleyo  esenza   similisele   iingqondo   kweli   Sebe
loPhuhliso loLuntu, xa  siphethe  umba  wamalungelo  nokuxhotyiswa  koomama,
kungenxa yokuba  lelona  sebe  lineziqamangelo  eziqatha  ngokoMgaqo-siseko,
ngakumbi  isahluko  2   isigaba   27(1)   esinika   wonke   ubani   ilungelo
kwizibonelelo  nenkxaso  kaRhulumente.  Zezi   zibonelelo   ke   athi   onke
amahlwempu abhenele kuzo ukuze  agxothe  indlala  ebomvu,  ngakumbi  kwicala
loomama abaphantsi kwembophelelo yomthetho  ongabhalwe  ndawo  othi  ``isisu
somntwana saziwa ngunina''.

Ngokwezicwangciso zeli Sebe  loPhuhliso  loLuntu,  ezi  zibonelelo  zenkxaso
zinabile, zijoliswe ekubeni zambese, kangangoko zinakho, iimfuno zabo  bonke
abantu abangathathi ntweni abakumabakala  ahlukeneyo  entlalo.  Kungummiselo
nesiseko  esingagungqiyo  seli  sebe  ukufaka   igxalaba   ukwenzela   ubomi
obukhaphukhaphu nokuqinisa idolo kwabo basindwa  ngumthwalo  kukunqongaphala
kweempiko zokuxhasa ubomi bemihla ngemihla.

Kungothakazelelo kananjalo ukuqwalasela igalelo  elisele  liqalisiwe  liSebe
loPhuhliso loLuntu ekuphuhliseni impilo yoomama  ngokwentlalo  nangoqoqosho.
Uhlelo  olujongene  noomama  olubizwa  ngelokuba  yiWomen   Flexi-Programme,
sithetha nje, luyagxanya lunabele kuwo onke  amaphondo,  ngokunjalo  nohlelo
olubizwa ngelokuba yiVictim Empowerment Programme.  I-UDM  inethemba  lokuba
oomama baya kuvuna lutho kule nkxaso.

Senza isilumkiso ke phofu ngelithi:  izibonelelo  zikaRhulumente,  namaphulo
okuvusa isizwe anjengala, zidla ngokuba  lixhoba  labo  banyolukileyo,  ithi
imizamo emihle kaRhulumente kanti  iya  kugqibela  ityebisa  iipokotho  zabo
bangenankathalo ngosizi lomnye umntu. Kwalapha kubo  oomama  ikho  imizekelo
esisele  siyibonile  ekuhlaleni  apho  ukutyhuthulwa  kwezibonelelo  zoluntu
olulambayo ingumbono wemihla ngemihla. Simelwe ke ngoko sonke  ngazwi  linye
kukuyikhalimela kabukhali le ndlela yababi phakathi kwethu.
Ngalo mazwi, nam ndenza igalelo kwisihloko sethu sanamhlanje.  Ndithi:  Maz'
enethole. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Mr H T  SOGONI:  Chairperson,  hon  members  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces and beautiful citizens of the Eastern Cape, yesterday and the  day
before we talked a lot about a number of Acts that include  the  Maintenance
Act, the Domestic Violence Act and the  Employment  Equity  Act.  All  these
Acts look good and promising to protect women from  any  kind  of  situation
that they may find themselves in.

However, one of the experts in law that spoke recently did mention  that  we
are still far from the end. These Acts have still not  made  their  mark  in
restoring the dignity of women and the youth in  general  in  this  country.
The debate today aims at looking at the unfavourable  situation  that  women
find themselves in, the fact that their rights are infringed and  that  they
are not living under conditions suitable  for  human  beings,  as  the  Lord
would want. The topic of our discussion is also focused on the role  of  the
Department of Social Development and its commitment to  the  empowerment  of
women  and  the  restoration  of  their  dignity,  so  that  they  can  live
comfortable lives that are suitable and appropriate for women who belong  to
a nation that is proud of protecting the rights of all its citizens  without
prejudice and hate.

The hon Minister of the National Department,  Dr  Skweyiya,  in  his  budget
speech for 2002, paved the way when he said:


  We still continue with our efforts to support  the  social  and  economic
  empowerment of women.

The theme of Dr Skweyiya's speech is based on the research  that  emphasised
that in order for any efforts of people's development to succeed,  it  would
be proper to focus first on the poorest of  the  poor  and,  in  particular,
women, and more so, those who are  in  rural  areas.  Statistics  show  that
there are 40% of unemployed women and, when looking at their  earnings,  one
would find that women earn 76% less than men. What  is  surprising  is  that
women  make  up  52%  of  our  society.  It  is  a  fact  that  poverty  and
exploitation are inseparable. We are not surprised when we hear about  cases
of human rights violations, especially  against  the  poor.  It  is  totally
unacceptable. That is the reason it is under discussion. It  is  because  we
are seeking proper solutions that could be implemented.

When we say that this situation poses  a  challenge  to  the  Department  of
Social Development, we do not mean that this Department has all the  answers
with regard to discrimination against women. The responsibility  to  develop
a nation can never be solely that of  a  single  department.  I,  therefore,
reiterate Dr Skweyiya's vision of calling upon everybody when he says:


  In achieving the objective of the ambitious programmes, we count  on  the
  support of many civil society partners.

The minister of this department in the Eastern Cape Province emphasized  the
fact that his department was nearly left behind in the integrated  programme
of departments, and that other administrative sections  have  a  significant
role in the fight against the violation of women's rights.

The reason that caused us to  focus  mainly  on  the  Department  of  Social
Development when dealing with the issue of empowering  women  and  honouring
their rights, is  that  this  department  is  bound  by  very  strict  rules
according to the Constitution, especially Chapter  2,  section  27(1),  that
gives everyone the right to Government provisions, service and  support.  It
is these provisions that the poor are looking at in order to drive away  the
frontiers of poverty, especially on the  side  of  women  who  struggle  and
suffer under an unofficial law that says, `It is the mother  who  knows  the
stomach of her child'.

According to the programmes of the Department of  Social  Development  these
provisions are broad and are meant to satisfy as much as possible the  needs
of all the  have-nots  according  to  their  living  conditions.  It  is  an
official stance of this department to assist  people  and  strengthen  those
that are struggling due to the scarcity of resources to support their  daily
lives, so that their everyday lives could be made easier.

It is pleasing also to notice the contribution that has  been  initiated  by
this Department of Social  Development  in  developing  the  life  of  women
socially and economically.  The  section  that  deals  with  women's  needs,
called the Women Flexi-Programme, as we speak, is taking  long  strides  and
spreading to all other provinces, as well  as  the  one  called  the  Victim
Empowerment Programme. The UDM hopes that women will be really empowered  by
this kind of support.

We would, however, like to give a warning  that  Government  programmes  and
campaigns like these that aim at developing a nation, often  become  victims
of and are abused by  greedy  people  and,  as  a  result,  efforts  of  the
Government end up enriching those who  do  not  care  about  the  plight  of
another person. Among women  there  are  examples  that  we  have  witnessed
already in our communities,  where  it  is  an  every  day  occurrence  that
provisions for the poor are abused and misused. Therefore, we  are  supposed
to speak strongly against such activities among us.

With those words I would like to say that I contribute to today's debate.  I
say: Thank you. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I thought,  hon
member, you would thank me for giving you an extra two minutes. [Laughter.]

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, hon members, the war on poverty  will  not  be  won
unless we direct more resources to the women of  South  Africa.  When  women
are educated, empowered and healthy, their  families,  communities  and  the
nation benefit. Despite the Government's stated commitment to human  rights,
gross disparities still exist between the realities  of  women's  lives  and
the assurances. In theory, through legislative  reforms,  the  situation  of
women has improved.  Legislation  has  been  enacted  in  respect  of  land,
housing, employment equity, family law, equality etc.  Unfortunately,  these
rights have not transformed the lives of many women in terms of  substantial
equality due to a lack of effective implementation thereof.

Factors impeding implementation include budgetary constraints and a lack  of
knowledge on the part of potential users of the  law,  such  as  police  and
justice workers; a failure to  adequately  communicate  and  educate  people
regarding Government policies, programmes and strategies,  and  particularly
legal reforms; the weakness of implementation mechanisms; and no  consistent
response to issues surrounding women's lives across all sectors.

At present the struggle for gender equality  is  not  fully  integrated.  As
part of an overall development perspective,  gender  equality  will  not  be
achieved  without  addressing  inequalities  across  the  prevailing  socio-
economic conditions. Poverty, employment, housing,  welfare,  education  and
training all need to be addressed in order to fully bring about  substantive
equality for women. Violence against women also  continues  to  be  a  major
stumbling block in the attainment of substantive equality.

We need to look at some issues of upliftment in  respect  of  improving  and
empowering our women, such as an extensive public awareness campaign in  all
languages through the use of the electronic  and  printed  media  about  the
right of women to be free of violence. Such a  campaign  must  address  both
women and men, and must target rural areas in an accessible way. It is  also
imperative    that    community    organisations,    especially    religious
organisations, are involved in the campaign on an  ongoing  basis  and  that
influential people in  the  communities,  including  politicians,  religious
leaders, business leaders and youth organisations  at  national,  provincial
and local level, make public statements in support of the campaign.

There should be proper  education  on  sex,  sexual  health,  the  crime  of
violence against women and  an  alternative  conflict  resolution  mechanism
other than violence as part of the  school  curriculum  taught  at  an  age-
appropriate level from an early age. Such programmes must also focus on  the
development of self-reliance  and  self-esteem  for  both  girls  and  boys.
Attention also needs  to  be  given  to  teacher  training  to  ensure  that
teachers feel qualified to deliver such education. There should be  training
for parents, by way of national workshops and seminars on parenting  skills,
and for men, through employees' organisations  and  unions.  Changing  men's
perceptions  should  receive  high  priority  as  a  mainstream  issue,  and
provision  should  be  made  for  both  primary  prevention  and   secondary
prevention, such as counselling programmes for abusers,  in  communities  by
representatives of the police and of welfare and legal services.

In spite of all the negative things that take place, changes are  happening.
There are more new spaces and opportunities for women now than ever  before.
The most significant change is that women have more visibility  in  society,
albeit not always to their benefit. Women acknowledge  that  the  Government
has begun to build houses, put in  electricity  and  provide  water.  These,
they said, did relieve some of their burdens  and  they  were  appreciative.
Some were able to point out new legislation and other Government  programmes
targeted to benefit women, and  still  mentioned  how  proud  they  were  to
participate in processes at the level  of  national,  provincial  and  local
government. Many more women's groups in the  form  of  NGOs  and  CBOs  were
visible, giving women the opportunity to  develop  their  leadership  skills
and engage with the transformation process.

In conclusion, I want to state the following: The South  African  Government
needs to be lauded for the efforts it has made to make things better as  far
as its policies  and  programmes  are  concerned.  The  recognition  of  the
importance of a society based on the concept of  the  human  rights  of  its
entire people led to the inclusion of issues surrounding the lives of  women
in the  Constitution  and  the  Bill  of  Rights.  The  Government  must  be
commended for its achievements and for developing  the  frameworks  for  the
attainment of formal equality. I want to conclude by quoting:


  Sure, God made man first, but you always do  a  rough  draft  before  the
  final masterpiece.

Luister mooi, Antoinette! [Listen carefully, Antoinette!]

We should have respect and appreciation for these  God-made  masterpieces  -
namely, women. [Applause.]

ikhaya  elifudumala  kahle,  liqine   futhi   linothe   ngaphandle   komuntu
wesifazane. Umnotho wekhaya, womphakathi jikelele nowesizwe, uqiniswa  futhi
uphakanyiswe yiqhaza elibanjwa ngabantu besifazane.

Intuthuko  yomphakathi  nesizwe  iyalikhulisa  iqhaza   elibanjwa   ngabantu
besifazane. Ake sibheke nje uHulumeni esinaye namhlanje.  Uqikelele  kakhulu
ukuphakamisa izinga labantu besifazane. Ubani  owayecabanga  ukuthi  singaba
namalungu  ePhalamende  abesifazane  amaningi  kangaka?  Kudinga  simshayele
ihlombe uHulumeni waseNingizimu Afrika. [Ihlombe.]  Sinamalungu  ePhalamende
abesifazane amaningi  ngaphezu  kwabo  bonke  ohulumeni  abakhona  lapha  e-
Afrika. Kukhona futhi oNgqongqoshe  besifazane  abaningi.  Intuthuko  ekhona
ezweni  lakithi,  ukuze  iqine  futhi  isimame  kakhulu,  iyamdinga   umuntu
wesifazane.

Uma  sibheka  iPhalamende  lethu  laseNingizimu   Afrika,   sibona   abaholi
abaqavile besifazane abaningi abaphethe izikhundla eziphezulu. Kusho  ukuthi
baphethe omama. USihlalo weNdlu yoMkhandlu kaZwelonke weziFundazwe  ngumuntu
wesifazane. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson and august House, I am standing in here for  Mrs
Vilakazi, who had to leave  because  her  flight  was  due  to  depart  much
earlier than anticipated. I hope that you will allow me to use choice  words
and skilful language since I am  here  -  across  the  Kei  River.  That  is
particularly so because we from the upper part of  the  country,  Mthaniya's
land, are related to the royalty of this area.  Therefore  we  are  at  home
here.

The topic for discussion today is:  Community  development  is  the  way  or
means for enhancing the power and dignity of and the role played  by  women.
We all know that a woman is the backbone of a home. Women are  the  backbone
of a nation. There is no home that can be abuzz with activity,  prosper  and
succeed without a woman. The wealth of a home,  the  general  community  and
nation is strengthened and reinforced through the role  that  is  played  by
women.

The development of a community and nation exponentially increases  the  role
of women. The Government that we have  today  is  focused  on  ensuring  the
upliftment of women. Who could have foreseen that we would have such a  huge
number of women members of Parliament? We need to applaud the South  African
Government. [Applause.] We have more women members of  Parliament  than  any
other government in Africa. We also have many Ministers who are  women.  The
development of our country  needs  women  in  order  to  grow  stronger  and
succeed.

When we look at our South African Parliament, we find that  there  are  many
prominent leaders who are women and who occupy high  positions.  That  means
that  women  are  leading.  The  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces is a woman.]

Therefore, when we talk about social development and women  empowerment,  we
mean exactly that - nothing more and nothing less.

Akujiyi kahle  engekho  umuntu  wesifazane,  kuyo  yonke  imikhakha  yempilo
kusukela  emndenini  kuze  emphakathini  esihlala  kuwo.  Ingani   namhlanje
sekukhona amakhosi ahola isizwe  okungawesifazane.  Angikaze  ngizwe  ukuthi
ikhona  inkosi  yesifazane  ehlulwe  ukuhola  isizwe.  Ikakhulukazi   ngapha
KwaZulu sinawo amakhosi esifazane. Kodwa-ke  kuchaza  khona  ukuthi  le  nto
okuthiwa ukubandlulula ngokobulili asiyazi thina KwaZulu ngoba  kade  saqala
ukwenza abantu balingane.

KwaZulu,  umuntu  wesifazane  ungumuntu  omkhulu  kakhulu   kithina.   Nguye
owayephatha  izwe.  Manje  sekuqalwe  phansi  kuthiwa   laba   bacindizelwe.
Angaliphatha    kanjani    izwe     umuntu     ecindezelwe?     Ezinkonzweni
sinabafundisikazi besifazane okuyinto ebingakaze  ibe  khona.  Likhona  yini
iqhaza elidlula lelo? Angikaze ngizwe kuthiwa behlulekile ukuhola ibandla.

Intuthuko yomphakathi nesithunzi sabesifazane kunamandla okuphatha  nokuhola
kodwa angikwazi ukubala zonke izindawo lapho behola khona. Ukuze  lithuthuke
kahle futhi lidlondlobale leli zwekazi, kudingeka amandla neqhaza  elibanjwa
ngabantu besifazane. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[In all spheres, nothing reaches its full potential without the presence  of
women - from families to the community in which we live.  Indeed,  today  we
have women chiefs who lead the nation. I have never heard of a female  chief
who failed in her duty of leading the nation. We  have  quite  a  number  of
female chiefs, particularly in  KwaZulu.  That  explains  that  this  gender
discrimination is something unknown to those of us from KwaZulu, because  we
started to make people equal a long time ago.

To those of us from KwaZulu, a woman is someone who is  held  in  very  high
esteem. She used to run the country. It is now  claimed  that  these  people
are oppressed. How can an oppressed person run a  country?  In  churches  we
have women priests and that is something that has never happened before.  Is
there any role which surpasses that? I have never heard that a woman  failed
to lead a congregation.

The development of the community and respect for women could  empower  women
for leadership; however, I cannot name all the areas in which women  are  in
leadership positions. In order  for  this  continent  to  develop  and  grow
appropriately, the power and role of women are crucial. [Applause.]]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon members of the NCOP, hon  members  of  the
provincial legislature, hon Deputy Speaker of the  North  West,  Speaker  of
the Eastern Cape provincial legislature and our beloved  countrymen  of  the
Eastern  Cape,  I  wish  to  reiterate  what  has  already  been  expressed,
especially yesterday: that today is a red-letter day in the history  of  our
young democracy. The NCOP has taken the giant step of taking Parliament  not
only beyond the precincts of  Cape  Town,  but,  most  importantly,  to  the
people who matter and are in our hearts. Our congratulations in  respect  of
this innovation go to the  hon  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP  and  the  entire
leadership force.

I stand here to corroborate the statement  that  social  development  is  an
appropriate instrument for women's empowerment.  The  Department  of  Social
Development, or DSD, is, in my view, second to none  in  its  commitment  to
social transformation as embodied in the principle  of  social  justice  and
the Bill of Rights contained in the Constitution. According to  its  mission
statement, it  endeavours  to  create  a  better  life  for  the  poor,  the
vulnerable and the excluded people in society.

The department has launched pilot projects in which  it  targets  unemployed
women with children under five years old, rural women and women in  informal
settlements who were previously excluded  from  services  and  developmental
programmes, as well as economic opportunities. This programme also  provides
training for the children of participating mothers.

The poverty relief programme of the DSD is  targeting  the  poorest  of  the
poor, female-headed households, those who are caring  for  HIV/Aids-infected
individuals, income-generating activities for the rural  women  and  elderly
persons.

The Domestic Violence Act  of  1998  requires  the  DSD  to  facilitate  the
establishment of shelters for victims of domestic  violence.  An  assessment
of the programme conducted in 2000 found that  there  were  21  shelters  in
South Africa, and that  18  more  shelters  were  needed  at  that  time  to
accommodate women who were in need  of  shelter  as  a  result  of  domestic
violence.

The DSD also observes National Women's Day on  9  August,  during  which  an
opportunity  is  given  to  sensitise  and   empower   women   about   their
constitutional  rights.  Celebrations  are  also  held  to  acknowledge  the
courage of women who fought against the pass laws for women  and  in  honour
of other heroines in different communities. [Applause.]

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson ...

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it in order for the  hon
member to address this august House whilst she is seated? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  will,  for
today, allow the hon member to do so. [Laughter.]

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, is it in order for the hon member  to  make  a
joke of a person's disability, namely their height? [Interjections.]

Chairperson and people of the Eastern Cape, in particular ...

... ukuba ngaba  bakhona  abakuKomani  naseHewu  emaMfengwini  amahle,  apho
ndiphuma khona.  [...  if  there  are  any  of  those  beautiful  ones  from
Queenstown and Whittlesea, where I come from.]

Let me say something first, before I get to  social  development.  When  hon
members were talking about Bram Fischer, I felt,  as  a  Free  Stater,  that
there was an example of his softness and humanity that had  been  left  out,
namely his decision to take a black  girl  from  his  domestic  workers  and
bring her up as his own daughter. It brings to mind an incident when, it  is
said, he was travelling through the Free State  with  his  family  and  this
young black girl, and his mother said, ``But she is  not  going  to  sit  at
table with us''. Bram Fischer made a decision then and said, ``Ma,  I  would
rather not have supper with  you.  I  am  pulling  out  because  she  is  my
family''. [Applause.]

Again, we are talking on a day in the month of August, which we say  is  the
month when, as women, we reclaim and restore  our  dignity.  I  am  pleading
with our menfolk here to join the  bandwagon  of  the  restoration  of  this
dignity.

When we opened with a prayer yesterday morning, we were told that  it  is  a
tradition in the Eastern Cape that people pray on all occasions. I now  want
to ask the Christians in the Eastern Cape the  question:  What  went  wrong?
The first book of the Bible, which  is  used  by  these  Christians,  has  a
woman, Eve, who  brought  wisdom.  What  went  wrong  that  women  were  not
developed then, if these people say that they are Christians?

If one goes on to the next chapters, one reads about  the  woman  who  saved
Moses. In the New Testament one reads about Mary, who is the mother of  this
thing they say they worship in the Eastern Cape. I am challenging them  now,
and saying that they are bound to social development for women.

Mrs Gouws said that there had never been a time  when  women  had  had  such
opportunities, but now my challenge to all of us here is:  How  much  effort
are we making to open the eyes of those who  do  not  know  that  they  have
these opportunities, and in particular ...

... bona ootata? Bayabavula amehlo na oomama? [... the  men  themselves?  Do
they inform the women?]

I then say: Now is the time for those who have not opened the  eyes  of  the
womenfolk to do so, particularly because we are now celebrating  five  years
of the Constitution which brought all these things. I say: Join the  million
man march, so that we can see that you are committed to opening the eyes  of
women to those opportunities.
Again, with regard to the people of the Eastern Cape, baba Bhengu  has  said
that in KwaZulu-Natal they have long  been  worshipping  women.  Women  have
been leading. When I sit at my great-grandparents' place eZibeleni,  looking
across I can see a mountain ...

... kuthiwa kukwaNonesi. [... known as Nonesi.]

This means that here, in the Eastern Cape, there was a  time  when  a  woman
ruled, a woman who was called Nonesi. So then ...

... kwaphinda  kwaphelela  phi  ke  kubantu  abahle  baseKoloni,  sele  bade
bayilibale into yokuba oomama bayakwazi ukusiphatha isizwe?  Ngoba  bayayazi
into yokuba uNonesi wasiphatha isizwe sakwaXhosa.  [So  how  come  beautiful
people from the Eastern Cape have forgotten that women can rule the  nation?
They know that Nonesi ruled the Xhosa nation very well.]

People have spoken about poverty as something that is disempowering,  but  I
will not touch on it. Because I happen to be the last speaker, so  much  has
been said already. The message I  will  be  talking  about  with  regard  to
social development is particularly from a  gender  perspective.  I  will  be
talking about gender within the context of  development.  I  would  like  to
remind this House and the NGOs ...

... nabanye abantu abahleli phayaÿ ...[... and  other  people  sitting  over
there ...]

... to remember that we do have the instruments which  we  developed.  There
is an  instrument  which  we  sometimes  forget,  the  Women's  Charter  for
Effective Equality, a document which was  developed  by  us,  the  women  of
South Africa, during the days  of  the  coalition.  As  a  country,  we  are
signatories  to  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All   Forms   of
Discrimination Against Women, and now, in particular, the  Beijing  Platform
of Action.

I want to put a challenge to the members  of  standing  committees  who  are
here, as well as the NGOs and the electorate out there. When  one  looks  at
empowerment and the  Beijing  Platform  of  Action,  one  can  see  that  we
requested departments to do certain  things.  For  instance,  we  said  that
there should  be  gender  focal  points  in  every  department.  This  is  a
challenge, whether one is in health or anywhere else or an NGO dealing  with
whatever matter. Whatever speciality we find ourselves  in,  we  should  all
check whether there is a gender focal  point  in  that  department.  If  so,
where is it situated? What is the level of the official? That is  important,
because if it is situated at a lower level and there is no access to the  DG
or whatever, we will be left behind.

The question of education has also been noted. My only comment  there  would
be: Whilst we say yes, all  aspects  of  education  are  aspects  of  social
development. At a higher level I challenge the NGOs there not to  forget  to
check where exactly women are at higher institutions. Are  they  still  only
in the humanities? That will also not take  us  too  far,  particularly  not
technologically.

Ms Jacobus mentioned quite a lot of things about health, but  there  is  one
aspect which is usually forgotten, in particular amongst us in  the  African
culture, namely that the time has come when negotiation for sex  should  not
be the duty of only one partner. It should be the duty of both partners  who
are going to take part in it. Gone are the days when it was only one  person
who could make the decision; when, if the other person  made  the  decision,
her morals would be looked at askance. [Applause.]

Justice has a lot of social aspects too. We  also  need  to  look  into  how
costly legal services are. Can we not provide low-cost legal services?  Here
I am challenging the NGOs,  in  particular,  to  teach  people  just  simple
things, what we call legal literacy. I  appeal  to  the  NGOs  here  in  the
Eastern Cape. They are fortunate that they have an office of the  Commission
for Gender Equality in East London where they will be empowered  about  this
whole dialogue.

The last aspect I am going to talk about, still within the  context  of  the
Beijing Platform of Action, is: How do we empower our  women  so  that  they
are able to live during the times of war and peace? We  need  to  teach  our
women mediation skills. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: (Mr M L Mushwana): Before I adjourn  the
House, allow me in a few words, without making a speech, on  behalf  of  the
NCOP, and in particular the presiding officers, to express our most  sincere
thanks and gratitude to the following people who, in  many  different  ways,
assisted us in our quest to try to bring Parliament closer  to  the  people:
the University of Transkei, in particular the  acting  vice-chancellor,  the
registrar and the SRC. We are grateful for their hospitality.

We also wish to express  our  thanks  and  gratitude  to  the  Eastern  Cape
legislature, in particular the Speaker and  the  Deputy  Speaker,  who  have
been with us since our arrival here. We  also  appreciate  the  presence  of
MPLs from the Eastern Cape. We wish to thank the O R Tambo District  Council
and, in particular, the lord mayor and councillors,  who  also  participated
in the proceedings which we have had since our arrival.

I must also express our gratitude to members of the public who responded  to
our call and have been with us. It is regrettable that we could not  provide
all the answers that they wanted, but this is the  beginning,  and  we  hope
that our interaction will bear more fruit in future.

My attention has been drawn to the fact that there are  people  who  thought
that today we were going to interact with them in terms of social  services.
We apologise for any misunderstanding which might have  developed.  This  is
not the end of our meetings. The provincial legislatures, MPLs  and  members
of Parliament deployed in this region will carry on this task.

We thank our traditional leaders who also responded to  our  invitation.  We
appreciate their presence. Finally we thank our NCOP  staff,  the  technical
staff and Hansard for their work since we started  preparing  the  NCOP  for
meeting the people. Of course, we also wish to  thank  the  members  of  the
NCOP who travelled all the way to the Eastern Cape.

On that note, the House is adjourned. [Applause.]

The Council adjourned at 12:50.
