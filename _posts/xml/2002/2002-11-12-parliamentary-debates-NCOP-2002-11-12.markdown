                   ELECTION OF ROTATING DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON

The meeting proceeded to the election of the Rotating Deputy Chairperson  of
the National Council of Provinces to fill the post vacated  by  the  Premier
of the North West, Mr P S Molefe.

The Chairperson of the NCOP called for nominations.

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, it is a great honour for me, on behalf  of  the
Western Cape, to propose Mr Marthinus Christoffel Johannes van Schalkwyk  as
the second Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP.

Marthinus van Schalkwyk has proved himself to be a young dynamic  leader,  a
leader belonging to the new generation of  South  Africans  who  are  deeply
committed to this country,  a  generation  that  believes  in  building  and
striving for excellence, not in breaking down or in mediocrity.

He is an Afrikaner and at this moment in time, when  attempts  are  made  by
the so-called ``Boerevolk al-Qaeda'' to lead the  Afrikaners  to  isolation,
polarisation and condemnation, it is fitting that Premier  Van  Shalkwyk  is
at the forefront of leading coloured  and  white  Afrikaner  communities  to
join hands with our black communities and draw  on  each  other's  expertise
and experiences to fight the  cancer  of  poverty,  unemployment,  Aids  and
crime, as well as unite under  a  true  spirit  of  South  Africanism  based
firmly on democracy and constructive dialogue. In doing so,  the  Afrikaners
can once again play a prominent role in serving our nation.

His inspiring leadership has put minority communities on the  high  road  of
reconciliation and nation-building,  dedicated  to  ensuring  that  a  truly
rainbow nation will be born. The Western Cape is often called  the  Cape  of
Good  Hope.  Our  premier  has  brought  new  hope  for  new   partnerships,
pioneering the Western  Cape  to  new  heights  through  consensus  and  co-
operative governance.

I am sure that the NCOP can only be enriched by his values  and  philosophy.
Our ideals are indeed bigger than self-interest.

Chairperson, I propose Marthinus van Shalkwyk.

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, I do hereby with pleasure second the  nomination
of Mr Marthinus van Schalkwyk as Rotating Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP.

Mr Van Schalkwyk has  shown  himself  to  be  committed  to  the  ideals  of
national reconciliation and nation-building. We are confident that  he  will
serve this Council well as Rotating Deputy Chairperson. [Applause.]

The Returning Officer reported to the Chairperson that the nomination  paper
had been properly completed.

There being no further nominations, the Chairperson  declared  Mr  Marthinus
Christoffel  Johannes  van  Schalkwyk  duly  elected  as   Rotating   Deputy
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: On behalf of  all  delegates  present  here,  I
congratulate Mr Van Schalkwyk on having been elected as the rotating  Deputy
Chairperson of the NCOP in terms of section 64(3) of the Constitution.

Ek doen nou 'n beroep op die lid om 'n paar woorde te sÃª.  [I  now  call  on
the member to say a few words.]
The  PREMIER  OF  THE  WESTERN  CAPE  (Mr  M  C  J  Van  Schalkwyk):   Madam
Chairperson, I would like to accept the nomination with gratitude, and  also
the position. The nine provinces in our country  are  critical  pillars  for
democracy, but also for delivery. Our Council here, the NCOP, is one of  the
most important instruments for co-operative governance.

I look forward to working with you as the Chairperson, and to  working  with
the rotating Chairperson as  well  as  all  the  members  of  this  Council.
[Applause.]

Die  VOORSITTER  VAN  DIE  NRP:  Baie  dankie,  Mnr  Van   Schalkwyk.   [The
CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you very much, Mr Van Schalkwyk.]

Provinces will make their congratulatory remarks during  their  response  to
the President's address.

It is now my great pleasure to call on the President. I thank  him  for  his
patience.

          ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH  AFRICA:  Madam  Chairperson,  Deputy
Chairperson, hon Premiers, hon members of the NCOP  and  Ministers,  I  must
confess that I had my eye on the position to which  the  hon  Marthinus  van
Schalkwyk has just been elected. [Laughter.] I tried to urge the Premier  of
the Eastern Cape, who is sitting next to me, to nominate me, but he told  me
it would be unconstitutional.

I thank you for affording me the  opportunity  once  more  to  continue  our
dialogue with the NCOP. In the  past  two  years,  we  have  discussed  such
matters as the role and place of local government structures, the  role  and
place of the institution of traditional  government  and  the  challenge  of
aligning this important institution to elected democratic structures.

We have also looked closely  into  the  question  of  intergovernmental  co-
operation, and the interaction between the Government  and  the  people,  as
well as the involvement of these masses of our people and their  communities
in the transformation of our society.

I am certain that the constant reflection on these  and  other  matters  has
helped us to improve our transformation programmes as well  as  bring  about
efficiency and effectiveness in the implementation processes.

We are still seized with the matter of arriving at  a  common  determination
of the role and place of the  institution  of  traditional  leadership,  and
ensuring that  it  works  in  harmony  and  side-by-side  with  the  elected
democratic structures of Government.

Hopefully the discussions around the draft White Paper  that  has  now  been
issued will help us finally resolve this matter to the satisfaction  of  all
our people, including the traditional leaders. I am  confident  that  as  we
engage this process, as all of us should, we will do so  in  a  manner  that
seeks to take our country forward, driven by a common desire to improve  the
lives of our people, and make development a permanent feature of  the  lives
of these very people on whose behalf we make all our pronouncements.

I therefore trust that  all  of  us  who,  in  various  ways,  are  part  of
processes  and  institutions  of  governance  in  this  country  will   work
constructively  and  in  a   manner   befitting   our   status   as   public
representatives to ensure that we resolve this  outstanding  matter  in  our
body politic so that all our people, wherever  they  may  be,  are  able  to
participate  fully  in  the  exciting  transformation  processes  that   are
changing our country for the better.

In this context, it is important that we avoid any confrontational  posture,
understanding that whatever needs to be resolved will be  concluded  through
an inclusive dialogue, and not through one part threatening all others  with
violence. Apart from the fact that the law enforcement authorities will  act
vigorously to protect lives and property against anybody who decides to  use
force to advance his or her goals, it is time that all  of  us  outgrow  the
period in our  history  when  resorting  to  violence  to  attain  political
objectives resulted in the loss of thousands of innocent lives.

As we have stated in the past, the challenge  facing  our  country  and  the
entire Government, from national,  provincial  and  local  spheres,  is  the
eradication of poverty, and the radical transformation of our  society  into
a truly nonracial, nonsexist democracy that is underpinned by  socioeconomic
equity, justice and prosperity.

In this regard, we have put in  place  numerous  processes,  structures  and
programmes that have taken and continue to  take  our  society  towards  the
realisation of this goal. The programmes of all Government  departments  and
the three spheres of government, as well  as  the  state  corporations,  are
geared towards one specific achievement - to bring about a better  life  for
all.

It is in this context that we come to this Council at least once a  year  so
as to assess the progress, or  lack  thereof,  of  the  work  we  are  doing
together   as   Government,   legislatures,   municipalities   and    public
representatives.

Of necessity, this exercise assists to perfect our work,  ensuring  that  we
continuously rectify mistakes that may be committed, and  improve  both  the
programmes and instruments at our disposal as we strive to  reconstruct  and
develop our country.

 Hon members may have seen the SAARF development index findings for 1994  to
2001, containing development data covering this period.  The  acronym  SAARF
stands for  the  South  African  Advertising  Research  Foundation.  In  its
conclusion, this report says:


  This analysis  of  SAARF's  All  Media  and  Product  Survey  data  shows
  extensive development in South African living standards  for  the  period
  1994 to 2001. It also shows that, in most respects, the RDP is  achieving
  its objectives. The only exception is job creation.

The data covers areas such as home ownership, provision of clean  water  and
electricity,  access  to  household  durables  such  as  electrical  stoves,
refrigerators,  television  sets  and  musical  equipment,  and  access   to
telephony.

It shows a steady decline in the proportion of people who earn less  than  R
2 500 a month, and a steady increase in the proportion  of  those  who  earn
between R2 500 and above R6 000.

Other reports, such as those  done  at  the  University  of  South  Africa's
Bureau of Market Research also state that the number  of  black  people  who
have become more affluent has increased. According to these  reports,  there
is a shift in expenditure  pattern  amongst  some  of  the  sectors  of  our
society, because there is more money available for  what  are  described  as
luxury products and services.

This change in the lives of the people did not come about on its own. It  is
the result of the  ongoing  efforts  of  Government  since  1994  to  create
conditions for all our people to lead better lives, as well as the  response
of the economy to these efforts. It indicates that, despite  the  challenges
facing all of us, as we transform our economy and society, we are moving  in
the right direction in the development of a new South Africa.

In this regard, it  is  clear  that  the  Government's  programmes  for  the
provision of essential services such as housing, water  and  electricity  as
well as  the  critical  interventions  with  regard  to  the  school-feeding
scheme, pensions and child support grants, have  helped  greatly  to  loosen
the grip of poverty.

I am told that, in line with the Government's theme of this year of  lending
a hand to push back the frontiers of  poverty,  members  of  the  NCOP  have
embarked on quarterly provincial visits  with  a  specific  focus  on  three
broad areas, which are: the 21 rural and urban development nodes in all  the
provinces; the monitoring of the  integrated  development  plans  and  their
alignment with all spheres of government,  and  local  economic  development
with the emphasis on SMME development, infrastructure  development  and  the
accessibility of government institutions that support this development.

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate  and  thank  the  NCOP
for the initiative to bring the national legislature closer  to  the  people
and to intervene to ensure that the policies  approved  by  the  legislature
are, in fact, being implemented.

This complements the important  work  that  we  are  doing  through  Imbizo,
whereby the mass of  our  people  continue  to  advise  us  about  the  best
possible ways of accelerating the pace of transformation. As the Council  is
aware, during the course of this year, we visited the provinces of the  Free
State and Gauteng where, once more, the citizens  of  this  country  engaged
Government about the manner in which we can, together, further  improve  the
quality of services.

I am quite certain that  members  who  visited  the  various  areas  of  our
country may have noticed both the  fact  that  we  are  making  progress  in
improving the lives of the people, as indicated by the surveys we have  just
mentioned, as well as the point  that  we  still  have  huge  challenges  to
overcome underdevelopment and poverty, especially in the historically  black
rural and urban areas.

Our duty  is  to  use  these  observations  and  reports  to  find  ways  of
increasing the pace of implementation of our policies, while  ensuring  that
the services we deliver are of a high standard. The reports that we give  to
this Council must assist us to make a correct assessment about the  progress
we are making in eradicating poverty and improving the lives of our people.

We all remember that in 2001, the Government identified 21 rural  and  urban
development nodes that would receive dedicated attention in our  efforts  to
eradicate  poverty  and  underdevelopment.  As  we  know,   the   Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Programme  and  the  Urban  Rural  Development
Programme are part of our comprehensive programmes in our  struggle  against
poverty.
We will have time, in the near future, to give a  more  detailed  report  on
these two programmes. In the meantime, it is important to restate  the  fact
that the primary intention of  both  these  programmes  is  to  implement  a
nationwide, intergovernmental, concrete and time-bound  set  of  initiatives
that  will  build  essential  infrastructure,  create  jobs,   bring   about
sustainable local industries and ensure development in the poorest parts  of
our country.

As hon members know, implementation of development  projects  is  proceeding
in all the 13  rural  and  eight  urban  nodes,  though  this  is  happening
unevenly. The projects range from  infrastructure  to  economic  and  social
development as well as capacity-building programmes.  Of  the  122  priority
anchor projects selected for the current year, at least half of them are  at
the implementation phase. Further, we have  established  all  the  necessary
institutional  and  governance  arrangements  for  these   two   programmes.
National, provincial and local management structures are now in place.  With
the support of the Independent Development Trust and  the  establishment  of
planning, implementation and  management  support  centres,  all  the  rural
nodes have the requisite capacity to begin and to implement the programme.

We should, at all times, ensure that there is  strong  political  leadership
and management for both  of  these  programmes.  These  programmes  seek  to
demonstrate how sustainable development can be attained  through  integrated
governance between the three  spheres  of  national,  provincial  and  local
government. Obviously, it will be important to  share  the  lessons  arising
from these two programmes and the 21 nodal points  with  all  municipalities
as we intensify our attack on poverty and  underdevelopment  throughout  the
country.

Last year, we said that  one  of  the  main  challenges  facing  us  in  the
transformation of our  society  is  the  urgent  need  to  ensure  that  the
democratic structures that were put in place serve as catalysts for  change,
and must therefore help our people to pull themselves out of the  morass  of
poverty and underdevelopment. Accordingly, we agreed  that  with  regard  to
local government structures, we should prioritise the  finalisation  of  the
Integrated Development Plans so that we are able to  move  faster  with  the
development of the poor and marginalised areas of our country.

This is because the Integrated Development Plans are central  to  our  work,
and will ensure  that  we  have  comprehensive,  practical,  integrated  and
implementable programmes of delivery.  Through  the  Integrated  Development
Plans, each one of us is  enjoined  to  ensure  that  from  formulation  and
planning to implementation of these programmes, our work is informed  by  an
integrated approach. I am therefore happy  that  about  251  municipalities,
which amount to 88% of  our  local  government  structures,  have  completed
their integrated development plans.

Naturally, while we are concerned that  there  are  33  municipalities  that
have not completed these plans, we are encouraged by  the  overall  progress
we are making in the process of beginning  to  implement  those  development
plans.

Of course, as the hon Premiers, I am sure, will point out,  there  is  still
the challenge of aligning these plans with the provincial programmes  which,
as we know, are also  intended  to  accelerate  the  transformation  of  the
living conditions of all our people. I am happy that this  is  also  one  of
the tasks that the NCOP has set  for  itself  in  the  work  that  is  being
carried out in the provinces.

At the national level, Government has adopted a planning framework so as  to
better inform and align  the  planning,  budgeting  and  programming  cycles
between all three spheres of government. Arising out of this  framework  and
the lessons of the municipal integrated development planning  to  date,  the
following matters are becoming increasingly obvious in our  ongoing  efforts
to strengthen the system of integrated and co-operative governance.

These are that we should find  a  practical  mechanism  of  ensuring  closer
collaboration and joint work between the  three  spheres  of  government  in
ensuring  successful  implementation  of  both  the  Provincial  Growth  and
Development Strategies  and  the  Municipal  Integrated  Development  Plans.
Formal  structures  and  processes  must  be  established  or   refined   to
facilitate and allow for this intergovernmental dialogue  and  collaboration
in developmental planning and implementation. This must include  the  timely
provision of the financial resources by all spheres of government to  ensure
that integrated development does, in fact, take place.

The President's Co-ordinating  Council  is  an  important  intergovernmental
structure where, together with the Premiers, we can ensure the alignment  of
programmes. It seems obvious that Salga should also join this  co-ordinating
council.  The  Provincial  Growth  and  Development   Strategies   and   the
Integrated Development Plans within each of our particular  provinces  needs
far  greater  alignment.  The  challenge  of  accelerating  the  process  of
transformation and the eradication of poverty must inform the priorities  of
Provincial Growth and Development Strategies and  the  IDPs.  Lastly,  there
should be strong mechanisms for all of these programmes.
Clearly, it is critical that while we are making good progress  in  ensuring
that there is integrated planning within the  local  government  sphere,  we
should  take  this  process  a  step   further   through   intergovernmental
interaction and policy coherence between the three spheres of government.

The NCOP has already  started  doing  this  and  it  is  important  that  it
continues to assist with  the  process  of  speedily  aligning  these  local
integrated development plans with similar programmes  at  the  national  and
provincial levels.

Clearly, our approach of integrated governance is premised on the  existence
of a strong, vibrant and active local  government  sphere  that  is  at  the
forefront of creating a better life for  all.  A  strong  and  active  local
government, working in an integrated way, will make  it  easier  for  us  to
achieve the development outcomes in all municipalities. These outcomes  are,
amongst others, the efficient  provision  of  essential  infrastructure  and
services such as housing, clean water and  sanitation,  electricity,  health
services, roads, schools and recreational facilities and waste removal;  the
creation of better, habitable, integrated cities,  towns  and  rural  areas;
and local economic development, and  community  reconstruction,  development
and empowerment.

Furthermore, it is encouraging to learn, from the Department  of  Provincial
and Local Government, that  there  has  been  an  improvement  in  terms  of
involvement and ownership of the Integrated Development  Plans  by  most  of
the leadership at the municipal level.

One of the ongoing challenges in this  important  work  is  to  ensure  full
participation of all our people in the  processes  of  development  so  that
they also have a sense of ownership and can contribute  in  whatever  manner
possible towards the success of these programmes.

Our efforts to improve the quality of  our  development  planning  processes
within and between the spheres of government is not an  end  in  itself.  We
have said previously that, given  the  impressive  levels  of  macroeconomic
stability that we have achieved as a country since 1994, our focus must  now
turn to micro-economic and local economic development.

I should say that, this afternoon, the Minister of Finance told me that  the
rating agency, Standard and Poors, has improved South Africa's  rating  from
stable to positive. [Applause.]

With regard to what I said earlier, one  of  the  challenges  facing  us  is
indeed around  the  issue  of  local  economic  development.  To  meet  this
challenge,  we  have  increased  the  dedicated  fund  for  local   economic
development from  R42  million  in  1999  to  R98  million  in  the  current
financial year. This has resulted in  a  steady  increase  of  the  projects
supported through this fund, with over 3 000  permanent  jobs  created.  The
importance  of  this  fund  is  that  it   creates   the   possibility   for
municipalities  directly  to  pursue  the  objectives  of   local   economic
development, especially job creation,  poverty  alleviation  through  income
generation and support for SMME development.
The projects  financed  by  this  fund  span  many  sectors,  from  the  the
agricultural sector focus on agro-processing to  tourism-related  activities
such as arts and crafts centres,  and  the  hospitality  infrastructure  and
services. It will be important for all  of  us  to  look  closely  into  the
various projects that are being undertaken at a local level,  because  I  am
convinced  that  we  all  have  a  duty  and  a  responsibility  to  support
municipalities and to  ensure  that  their  efforts  around  local  economic
development do, indeed, succeed.

Clearly, the lessons that  we  learn  on  local  economic  development  will
require that we focus on some of the following challenges. Support for  job-
creating enterprises  must  be  increased.  We  should  identify  areas  and
sectors  of  comparative  and  unique  advantage  and  offer  the  necessary
support. We should work on strong partnerships with the established  private
sector and community-based  structures.  We  must  create  specific  income-
generation and job creation programmes directed  at  poor  and  marginalised
groups in our society. We must continue to improve the skills levels of  our
people so that they are better able to start their own  businesses  as  well
as  increase  their  chances  of  employment.  The  alignment  of   economic
development strategies  between  the  three  spheres  of  government  is  an
important factor for the success of local economic development.

In this context, we should find ways of tapping the skills and resources  of
the affluent sections of our municipalities to help  the  poorer  areas.  We
should do this, because we want every part  of  South  Africa  to  begin  to
experience development and prosperity. As we go back to  our  provinces  and
municipalities, we should remember that we have a  heavy  responsibility  of
putting in an extra effort to serve our people and our  country.  We  should
keep in mind that for our country to make the necessary development,  it  is
incumbent on all of us  to  continue  to  lend  a  hand  to  push  back  the
frontiers  of  poverty,  and  continuously  to  extend  the   frontiers   of
prosperity.

We do have the required policies and programmes.  Government  will  continue
to allocate resources to the extent that it is possible. It falls upon  each
one of us to do what we can so that we achieve the goal  of  a  better  life
for all. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN  CAPE  (Mr  E  M  Dipico):  Chairperson,  Deputy
Chairperson, hon President, members of the NCOP, comrades and  friends,  let
me open this small intervention by noting that we have come a  long  way  in
putting solid building blocks for our democracy to thrive and withstand  any
type of subversive attempts to undermine the gains  we  have  achieved  over
the past few years. As a people, we remain firm in our believe that in  this
civilised world the only way we can resolve disagreements, as our  President
always says, is through democratic means within the framework  of  the  rule
of law. In this country, the basis of our law is further entrenched  in  the
Bill of Rights.

Indeed, what we are busy with is the  construction  of  a  future  based  on
humane  principles,  a  future  that  embraces  the  rule  of  law.  We  are
principally seeking to build a nonracial and nonsexist democratic order,  to
secure the future of our children and our country.

Therefore, we stand here to also add our voice  to  our  leadership's  call,
particularly our President's, to unequivocally denounce acts of  terror  and
those who are responsible for planning and executing such  callous  acts  on
unsuspecting civilians and ordinary people. The majority of our people  want
the state to act swiftly in its pursuit to bring those responsible to book.

It has also become imperative, as provinces move with speed, to ensure  that
democracy and its gains impact  more  significantly  on  the  lives  of  our
people, especially the rural masses, our children and women  in  particular.
Another imperative that should be  encouraged  is  the  building  of  strong
relations between provinces for the sake of enhancing social development.

Therefore we want to express our gratitude to the  Premier  of  the  Western
Cape,  Mr  Martinus  van  Schalkwyk  and  his  executive  council,  for  the
leadership they are demonstrating in advancing our  common  interest  within
the context of the national  interest  of  our  country  through  provincial
collaboration in key areas of social delivery and economic development.

We have consistently  argued  in  this  House  that  tourism  benefits,  for
example,  can  only  be  optimised  if  we  see  this  key   growth   sector
holistically and attend to the other elements of the sector to  broaden  its
scope. It is imperative that the Northern Cape, the  Western  Cape  and  the
Eastern Cape collaborate in optimising tourism and other  economic  benefits
that can be derived from the N1 and N7, which go through  several  towns  in
our provinces.

The intraprovincial  co-operation  agreement  signed  between  the  Northern
Cape, the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape  provinces  forms  the  platform
from which we can further ensure the national imperative  and  significantly
enhance, develop and give meaning in a significant way.

The people of our country are also not hung up on  provincial  borders,  but
yearn for qualitative change and  service  delivery  irrespective  of  their
place of residence or province, as the President said. This  has  been  real
in the area of health, job creation and the economy  of  our  country  as  a
whole, ensuring that, even across borders, we impact on  the  lives  of  all
our people. Indeed, the Kgalagadi node is a clear  example  of  co-operation
between the Northern Cape and the North West provinces.

We have also been hard at work extrapolating as to what has to  be  done  to
enhance the efforts of our leadership in Nepad. The  President  and  Cabinet
have been leading these areas, and we as provinces need to  put  meaning  to
it to ensure that we establish mutually beneficial  relationships  with  our
immediate neighbours, for example Namibia, Botswana,  Zimbabwe,  Mozambique,
and so on.

In the context of the Northern Cape we have signed  an  agreement  with  the
Carras region, the southern part of Namibia. Besides being on our  doorstep,
the interrelated cultural, language and family ties that exist  between  the
people of this region and the people of Upington and Namaqualand regions  of
the Northern Cape compel us  to  do  something  about  it.  The  economy  is
intertwined and the farmers work together. Indeed, it  is  only  for  us  as
leadership to give meaning to that type of work.

When one looks at the Orange River Scheme and the success of the farmers  in
South Africa, one finds that there is no development in Namibia because  the
whole river is owned by South Africa. The people of Namibia and  farmers  in
that area can, therefore, not tap into that resource, ie  the  water,  which
is the lifeblood of that area. Indeed, we hope  that  this  matter  will  be
resolved at national level to allow those people to tap into that source  of
life, ie the water.

There is, indeed,  scope  to  unfold  mutual  beneficial  programmes  around
tourism and other economic issues, as well as deal with  cross-border  crime
and other security matters easily and swiftly. Indeed, we  have  taken  this
African Renaissance issue much  further.  We  have  suggested  exchanges  of
teachers who would come to our province  from  Namibia  to  teach  the  Nama
language, so as to preserve this indigenous language of our people. This  is
a very important language to the people of South Africa who  reside  in  the
Northern Cape.

Recently we also hosted a delegation from Rwanda. We exposed the members  of
the delegation to the intricacies of political  life  among  the  province's
people, and to the diverse languages, nature and races. We also showed  them
how the people are working together for the good of  the  province  and  the
country.

Solidarity, which has always been what drove all of us to be  where  we  are
today, particularly with countries that supported the  liberation  struggle,
is very crucial in ensuring that we continue to  be  relevant  event  during
this era. We have just returned from Cuba,  and  have  signed  an  agreement
with the province of Havanna.

This will once again benefit our people, who have been part of the  struggle
to bring  about  change.  They  will  learn  from  each  country  about  its
difficulties,  and  how  they  can  also  succeed   under   very   difficult
circumstances. The Cuban doctors and their families  in  the  province  know
that they are at home as they proceed to assist us in the rural areas.

We have a contingent of students in various fields who were  sent  from  our
province to go and study in Cuba. We believe that that work  is  going  very
well, because our children are determined to come back and serve the  people
in the rural areas, as opposed to being forgotten in Johannesburg  and  Cape
Town. They will  come  back  to  places  such  as  Lilliefontein,  Pofadder,
Richmond and so on. That is what we need from patriotic South Africans.

As we prepare for the first decade of liberation and democratic  governance,
we need to make sure that a  solid  base  is  in  place  to  ensure  further
development and the unfolding of the dreams of our forefathers, who saw  our
country and the continent playing a huge role  in  the  promotion  of  peace
across the globe, as well as being instrumental to change. We should  ensure
that a legacy is in place to  withstand  the  rogue  elements  who  want  to
reverse our gains as a people and a country; build  on  the  work  that  has
been done to contribute towards efforts for peace and a  just  world  order;
realise the goodness of  common  efforts  to  ensure  a  humane  world;  and
protect the environment for sustainable development.

We must continue to put pressure on companies and institutions that  neglect
the people who contributed a great deal to help them  accrue  wealth  during
their operations in  this  country.  We  are  here  speaking  about  certain
situations in mining, where  for  example  the  people  of  Prieska  in  the
Northern Cape and Ga-Mathabathe in Limpopo, who deserve  much  better,  have
up to now been at the mercy of Cape PLC and their financial backers.

Once more, we need to stand together to ensure that our people  get  justice
in this regard. We believe that the mining charter does deal  with  the  way
forward to ensure that all companies act responsibly  in  the  rural  areas.
They should play their role to ensure that  our  people  are  protected.  We
must never again repeat what has happened in the big holes -  that  is,  the
manganese, iron ore and asbestos areas - where our people  are  still  going
through difficulties.

In  conclusion,  the  role  of  this  House  has,  once  more,  been   aptly
demonstrated  by  its  furtherance  and  development  of  democracy,  as  we
continue to go around provinces to ensure that the Government of the  people
is in place. I want to thank the Chairperson  for  the  leadership  she  has
given to all of us to continue to be in touch with our people. I  also  want
to thank the President for the line of march he has given us.

We have demonstrated that it is at local government level where  it  matters
most, because that is where we need to  change  the  lives  of  our  people,
eradicate poverty and implement the  IDPs  which  have  been  concluded,  to
ensure  that  there  is  an  economic  revival  which   will   bring   jobs.
Partnerships with the new mining groups that are  coming  in  would  for  us
spell a new challenge to  ensure  that  our  people  benefit  from  the  new
operations in those mines.

We also are thankful for the President's leadership  in  ensuring  that  the
Northern Cape at last has an institution of higher learning,  where  we  can
develop skills that are particular to the Namas, the Griquas, the  Sans  and
other people who are forgotten. We want  to  ensure  that  we  are  able  to
develop them where they live. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE FREE STATE (Miss I  W  Direko):  Madam  Chairperson,  hon
rotating Chairperson of the NCOP, hon President Thabo Mbeki,  hon  premiers,
hon members of the provincial legislatures present  in  this  Council  today
and hon members of the NCOP, ...

... dit is vir my 'n voorreg om die agb Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk  geluk  te
wens met sy nuwe posisie in hierdie Raad. Dit is nog  'n  verdere  stap  van
verantwoordelikheid wat ons almal sal moet dra om 'n beter land  op  te  bou
vir 'n beter toekoms vir ons land. Baie geluk vorentoe. [Applous.]

AGB LEDE: Hoor, hoor! (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[... it is a privilege for me to be able to congratulate the  hon  Marthinus
van Schalkwyk in this Council on his new position. This is  a  further  step
in the responsibility that all of us shall have to bear in order to build  a
better country for a better future for our country. I  wish  him  everything
of the best for the future.

HON MEMBERS: Hear, hear!]

THE PREMIER: The reversal of the  legacy  of  poverty  and  underdevelopment
remains the biggest challenge facing us as a nation, because this forms  the
very foundation of the reconstruction and development of the  lives  of  the
poor masses of this country. In the Free  State  the  declining  mining  and
agricultural activities, that are the mainstay of the economy  of  the  Free
State, compound this problem.

A sustainable and concerted strategy dealing with these challenges is the 3-
year  Free  State  Development  Plan,  underpinned  by  the  following  five
strategic objectives:  enhancing  economic  development  and  job  creation;
providing and facilitating  sustainable  infrastructure;  investing  in  the
development of the people of the Free State;  ensuring  a  safe  and  secure
environment  for  all;  and  sound,   co-operative   governance   with   the
sustainable use of resources in the environment.

Our first effective step in this direction was  the  transformation  of  our
new municipalities. This entailed the fast-track  capacity-building  of  the
five district municipalities and 20 local municipalities.  Central  to  this
process was the development of the integrated development  plans,  or  IDPs,
which are aligned to the Free State Development Plan. In  order  to  monitor
the progress made with  government  programmes  and  therefore  delivery  at
local government level, the Free State provincial  government  continues  to
benefit from the  establishment  of  the  Provincial  and  Local  Government
Forum, which we refer to as Provloc, and the Premier's Mayors  Forum,  which
meet monthly and bimonthly respectively.

Our fight against poverty in the province is a collective onslaught  and  is
showing promising signs. The nodal area of Thabo Mofutsanyane  is  receiving
undivided attention from all spheres of government. I am proud  to  announce
in this Council that 30 development  projects  were  packaged  to  alleviate
ravaging poverty in this area. Over R400 million is earmarked for all  these
development projects. To date 15 projects have been launched  and  the  rest
are in various stages of completion. R201 million has been either  spent  on
or committed to these 15 projects.

In the true spirit of integrated rural development, these projects  include:
housing; bulk water supply; health care; schools; roads;  telecommunication;
electricity; vegetable farming; and water purification, which is  critically
needed in Thabo  Mofutsanyane,  in  fact  in  the  whole  of  Qwaqwa.  These
projects created 1 865 sustainable jobs and 4 091 temporary jobs.
The Free State province's answer to the declining  mining  and  agricultural
sectors is the transformation of the  economy  and  the  development  of  an
industrial development strategy  underpinned  by  strong  manufacturing  and
export markets. Beneficiation of natural resources and the establishment  of
agro-industry is our answer. To this end  the  Virginia  Jewellery  Hub  has
been established. To date R100 million's worth  of  foreign  investment  has
been secured, immediately creating 350 permanent job  opportunities  with  a
further 1 250 opportunities at a later stage. A jewellery  school  has  been
opened  with  the  first  intake  of  18  students   from   the   previously
disadvantaged communities to be trained in jewellery designing  and  related
skills.

The  economic  transformation,  with  specific  reference   to   sustainable
development, is currently at the top of our agenda.  For  this  purpose  the
Free State provincial government held  a  series  of  stakeholder  sessions,
soliciting their commitment and pledge in  making  the  Free  State  economy
work. The Free State government and its social partners have also  committed
themselves fully to the African Union and the New Partnership  for  Africa's
Development. The  province  is  engaged  in  continuous  dialogue  on  these
continental initiatives with universities, the private  sector,  faith-based
organisations, NGOs, youth formations and local government.

In the spirit and letter  of  Nepad,  the  Free  State  government  is  also
involved in transfrontier health,  education,  social  welfare,  safety  and
security,  tourism  and  infrastructure  development  with   our   neighbour
Lesotho. In response to famine  in  Lesotho  a  month  ago  the  Free  State
government negotiated  with  Free  State  commercial  farmers  to  get  into
Lesotho with their own tractors and plough the land of the Basotho  farmers.
This process is still continuing. We are therefore thankful to  our  farmers
who enthusiastically responded to our call for assistance.  We  are  hopeful
that many more will demonstrate the spirit of oneness when  called  upon  to
do so in the future.

In addition to binational agreements entered into between Lesotho and  South
Africa, we are also part of  the  Maluti-Drakensberg  Transfrontier  Tourism
Development in partnership  with  Lesotho,  KwaZulu-Natal  and  the  Eastern
Cape. Steady but meaningful progress is  being  made  on  the  international
front. Co-operation agreements have been signed  between  our  province  and
Australia, Belgium and Canada. An achievement of note in this regard is  the
recent agreement with  the  European  Union  to  increase  funding  for  the
agricultural  poverty-alleviation  programme,  which  we  refer  to  as  the
Community Project Fund Support Programme. Funds are increased from  R10  000
to R25 000 per beneficiary per project.

In conclusion, it is with a special sense of accomplishment that I  announce
in this Council that we have succeeded with our  partners  from  faith-based
organisations in launching the  moral  regeneration  movement  in  all  five
regions as a means of involving municipalities and councils at  that  level,
which  culminated  in  the  provincial  launch  just  this  past  Friday  in
Bloemfontein.
The Free State joins the hon the President in the condemnation of  senseless
attacks on defenceless people. It must not and  should  not  be  allowed  to
continue in this country. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, I should have indicated  at
the start of this sitting that the House  is  pleased  to  indicate  to  our
President that we have a new Deputy Chairperson, the hon Mahlangu.

I think this information will also be of interest to our colleagues. I  note
that there are a number of speakers from the provincial legislatures, and  I
welcome them here today. The hon Mahlangu is in the House. Mr  Mahlangu,  if
you could just rise for a moment, so that the members should  know  who  you
are. [Applause.]

I have also noted that there was an individual termed the  Public  Protector
present in the gallery. He is the former Deputy Chairperson. He has  stepped
out for a moment, but he is present with us  today  as  well.  I  also  must
indicate  that  we  have  in  the  public  gallery  a  delegation  from  the
Parliament of South Korea. If we could ask them  to  stand  up.  [Applause.]
You are welcome in the Parliament of South Africa.

We now proceed to call  on  the  Chief  Whip  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces, Mr Surty.

The CHIEF WHIP OF  THE  NCOP:  Chairperson,  hon  President,  hon  premiers,
special delegates from the provincial  legislatures,  delegates  from  Salga
and members, may I join those that have spoken before me  in  congratulating
Mr Van Schalkwyk on his appointment as the rotating  Deputy  Chairperson  of
this Council. We are confident that, given the proximity  of  Parliament  to
his offices, we will be able to engage very frequently in  terms  of  issues
that face our country.

On 31 July 2002 a historic journey by Parliament, through the  NCOP,  began.
As we travelled to Umtata, we observed the extraordinary beauty  around  us:
the rolling hills and valleys, and the pristine  purity  of  the  landscape.
This served as  a  gentle  reminder  to  us  to  preserve  and  sustain  our
environment. We passed the region where our President was born, and  entered
the O  R  Tambo  region,  home  to  two  of  our  previous,  successive  ANC
presidents.  Indeed,  the  Eastern  Cape  is  a  political   incubator   for
leadership and presidents.

Parliament embarked on its journey to meet the people. Our primary task  was
to  listen  to,  and  investigate  the  enormous  problems  the  poor   were
encountering in accessing social development grants  in  the  Eastern  Cape.
Also on our agenda were meetings with traditional leaders, academics,  women
and other citizens. Our visit culminated in a plenary at the  University  of
Transkei, where we were able to report to the people  of  the  Eastern  Cape
that certain areas that were at that  time  afflicted  by  floods  would  be
declared disaster areas by our President.

We also conveyed the unstinting commitment of the  Premier  of  the  Eastern
Cape and  members  of  his  executive  committee,  who  notwithstanding  the
exceptionally inclement weather, went  to  those  areas,  provided  support,
empathised with the vulnerable victims and determined  what  mitigating  and
rehabilitative steps they could take in the face of this disaster  that  had
afflicted people. We  congratulate  the  Premier  on  his  re-election  and,
indeed, say that this comes as no surprise to us. [Applause.]

Indeed, we saw Government responding to  the  plight  of  the  people  in  a
manner consistent with the  statement  of  our  President,  Mr  Mbeki,  that
democracy  is  about  creating  a  humane  and  caring  society,   and   the
establishment of institutions that are people-centred. The public  hearings,
especially  in  respect  of  social  development,  convinced  us   that   an
integrated approach to service delivery  is  indeed  the  correct  one.  The
impact of inefficiencies in the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  resulted  in
frustrating the poorest of the poor from accessing social  grants,  as  they
could only do so with the new identity documents.

These and other matters have been referred  to  various  committees  of  the
NCOP for monitoring and follow-up. The successful  implementation  of  these
critical programmes  will  depend  largely  on  effective  intergovernmental
relationships, an area which requires our preferred and constant  attention.
It also raises political questions  of  devolution  or  decentralisation  of
certain areas of national competencies.

We held a plenary at the University of Transkei, to give citizens in  remote
and far-flung areas of our country an opportunity to observe the  law-making
process. It was an interesting coincidence  that  we  dealt  with  the  Bill
which sought to reinstate legal practitioners that were struck off the  roll
because  of  their  political  convictions  and  activism.   One   of   such
practitioners was Braam Fisher, for whom we had a special exhibition at  the
University of Transkei. That this occurred in the  district  which  produced
the first black legal partnership of O R Tambo and Nelson Mandela,  made  it
all the more poignant.

Madam Chair, we must acknowledge your leadership, with  the  support  of  Mr
Mushwana, who left us a short while ago, in  arranging  this  inspiring  and
important visit. It goes without saying that  without  the  co-operation  of
the provincial  government,  our  partners  in  the  legislature  and  local
government, this could not have been accomplished.  We,  therefore,  express
our gratitude to them and other stakeholders for their support.

The President had invited this Council to define its role in the context  of
our Constitution and co-operative governance. Pursuant to  this,  we  sought
creative  ways  in  fulfilling  our  mandate,  both  from  the   legislative
perspective and our inherent oversight role. We came today,  with  humility,
to provide the President and our premiers with a glimpse of how we have,  in
partnership with  our  legislatures  and  to  an  extent  local  government,
embarked on a programme to give effect to the constitutional  imperative  of
responsive, participatory and inclusive governance.

In so doing, we have elected not to walk too far behind the  President,  nor
ahead of him, but with him, to grapple with the  challenges  of  eradicating
poverty and creating what he has described as a humane and  caring  society.
We did so by ensuring that the provincial weeks focus on the critical  areas
of development, aimed at eradicating poverty and improving  the  quality  of
the lives of our people.

In so doing,  we  recognise  that  our  Constitution  categorically  enjoins
Government in terms of its underlying values and the right to  equality,  to
take appropriate steps to redress the inequalities  of  the  past.  This  in
effect means that we must monitor and  oversee  the  concrete  and  tangible
steps taken by Government to eradicate poverty and redress  the  disparities
created by our unfortunate past. Let us expand on this notion briefly.

During the provincial week we selected an area of oversight in  consultation
with our counterparts in the provincial legislatures  that  is  critical  to
the developmental agenda of Government, and occurs in  the  context  of  co-
operative and intergovernmental relationships.  The  21  presidential  nodes
were a classical developmental initiative aimed at  creating  an  integrated
and sustainable rural development and urban renewal.  It  posed  a  specific
challenge for co-operative governance and intergovernmental relationships.

In a week, we were able to achieve a broad view of  whether  the  programmes
are functional in the nine provinces,  and  identify  the  achievements  and
challenges that confronted our  provinces.  The  visit  was  followed  by  a
discussion among all members of this Council, with a view  to  consolidating
a report arising from our different experiences, and sharing information  in
relation to the visits that we had undertaken to the nine  provinces  during
the week.

We thereupon debated the matter in plenary with the Minister for  Provincial
and Local Government, and we must thank him for  the  support  that  he  has
provided to our various delegations in  terms  of  information  and  details
about  the  various  programmes.  The   horizontal   and   intergovernmental
interaction allowed us to make, among others, the  following  determinations
and recommendations.

Firstly, all nodes were engaged  in  tangible  activities  which  contribute
significantly   to    integrated    sustainable    development.    Secondly,
notwithstanding the wonderful co-operation between the North  West  and  the
Northern Cape in the Kgalakgadi district, it  has  been  our  view  that  we
should revisit the issue of whether, in fact, cross-boundary  municipalities
are practical or viable,  and  whether  they  are  functional  in  terms  of
political  and  administrative  management.  We  believe   that   provincial
boundaries should be revisited  in  order  to  ensure  and  achieve  optimal
delivery.

Thirdly, the  sustainability  and  maintenance  of  the  diverse  programmes
depended largely on the municipalities taking ownership of  these  projects.
Their participation must, therefore,  be  enhanced.  Provincial  governments
have a particular responsibility to ensure that  they  monitor  and  provide
whatever appropriate capacity and support is necessary to local government.

On another  visit  we  closely  examined  the  efficacy  of  the  integrated
development plans; whether they were understood by councillors and  managers
alike; and what the relationship of the IDPs  in  local  government  was  to
that  of  provincial  government  and  the  national  priorities.  We   also
endeavoured to determine the level of participation of the  public  in  both
the IDP and the budget processes. This critical  area  of  local  government
will be expanded on by a colleague who will speak later.

I would like to say to the President that it is  clear  that  without  local
economic  development  and  investment  in  infrastructure,  the   necessary
developmental environment for economic  growth  and  opportunity  cannot  be
created. It  is  critical  that  we  determine  how  effective  the  various
economic entities or agencies are in the provinces and at the level  of  the
local government. Do they make an impact on our people? Are  they  promoting
small, medium and micro enterprises in an efficient manner? What kind of co-
ordination exists between local  government  and  provincial  government  in
this regard?

This was the subject of our enquiry on another  provincial  week,  and  this
area will be canvassed by a colleague who will speak  more  fully  about  it
later. At another level we realised that the legislative processes  must  be
extended to involve  local  government  and  other  stakeholders.  With  the
support of our legislatures, we were able to  discuss  critical  legislation
with councillors in areas away from the  seat  of  provincial  legislatures.
This was in keeping with our aspiration to have a people-centred,  inclusive
and participatory democracy.

The crossing-of-the-floor legislation and the Disaster Management Bill  were
among the examples where we held public hearings and discussions with  other
stakeholders and  ordinary  citizens,  and  we  received  extremely  helpful
submissions from them to the extent that they shape  the  ultimate  form  of
the legislation.

The  strength  of  any  development  programme  must  be  in  the  budgetary
allocation of resources to execute the  programme.  As  part  of  our  close
engagement with our legislatures and the executive, we were able  to  engage
with the Medium-term Expenditure Framework in all nine  provinces.  We  were
adequately equipped by the Minister of Finance, and all  delegations  sought
to share this information with the nine provinces. Our engagement  with  the
provinces provided us with the context  of  the  expenditure  framework  and
enhanced our understanding of the current financial and fiscal trends.

The  President  will  notice  that  in  this  House  we  try  to  develop  a
comprehensive grasp of the issues we have, as we have the responsibility  of
promoting provincial interests. But we do so without  seeking  to  undermine
our national identity, nor to undermine the national  priorities  that  have
been set in motion by our Government. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The  PREMIER  OF  THE  WESTERN  CAPE  (Mr  M  C  J  van  Schalkwyk):   Madam
Chairperson, the  pessimists  are  saying  that  South  Africa  will  become
another Zimbabwe, but we know that South  Africa  will  be  a  success.  The
pessimists are saying that relations between our different  communities  are
deteriorating and will continue to  worsen.  They  take  great  pleasure  in
predicting widely and loudly the end of our rainbow  nation.  We  know  that
there are enough leaders of character and quality from  every  community  in
South Africa to do what must be done, ie to  build  our  common  future  and
again prove the pessimists wrong.

One of the most pressing challenges confronting our country in our quest  to
succeed is the burning question of land and land reform. We have  heard  the
hon the President talking  this  afternoon  about  poverty  alleviation  and
sustainable economic development.  Our  approach  to  land  reform  must  be
driven   by   the   principles   of   sustainability,    transparency    and
responsibility. It must aim to protect private  property  and  at  the  same
time extend land ownership to those who were previously denied access.

Since 1999  the  Department  of  Land  Affairs,  with  the  co-operation  of
farmers, has been  able  to  deliver  more  than  1,1  million  hectares  of
formerly private land for redistribution, as well  as  another  1,2  million
hectares of state agricultural land. Government's target  of  redistributing
30% of all agricultural land in South Africa by 2015 and the fact that  R323
million has been put aside for land reform and  restitution  over  the  next
three years, should be welcomed by all and deserve our collective support.

As the government of the  Western  Cape  we  are  critically  aware  of  how
important it is for us to broaden the base of those communities who  benefit
from economic growth. More people from more communities  need  to  feel  the
power of economic change, particularly in the agricultural sector.

Our plan is to settle 7Â 000 new  emerging  farmers  from  the  coloured  and
black communities in addition  to  the  11  000  existing  white  commercial
farmers as soon as possible through the 150 development projects  registered
in our province. This will be done in close partnership  with  Agri  Western
Cape, the organised body of commercial farmers. Agri Western Cape  continues
to play a very positive and constructive role in land reform in the  Western
Cape.

The story of successful land reform in South Africa is the story of men  and
women like Mr Trevor Abrahams. Last year, under our  land  reform  programme
in the province, Mr Abrahams was settled on 18 hectares of land in the  Warm
Bokkeveld near Ceres. Operating under the name ``Trevor se Boerdery'',  with
the help and mentorship of Mr Robert Graaff of a  nearby  farm,  Lushof,  Mr
Abrahams planted peaches and butternuts for the export market,  as  well  as
other crops for sale locally. This year he aims to produce carrots  for  the
Taiwanese market. He is an example of  how  South  African  men  and  women,
given the opportunity, will make a success of meaningful land reform.

North Ridge Farms, also outside Ceres,  provides  another  example  of  land
reform which has worked. One year after facing unemployment, Mr Paul  Onrust
and the workers of North Ridge Farms have celebrated  their  first  year  as
100% shareholders, with a profit of R1,3  million  on  a  turnover  of  R7,9
million.  With  hard  work  and  dedication  to  make  a  success  of  their
opportunities, the people of North Ridge have  shown  us  all  that  can  be
accomplished.

Both Mr Trevor Abrahams and Mr Paul Onrust, as well as Mr Kosie Loubser  and
Mr Frans le Roux of Agri Western Cape are in the  public  gallery  today.  I
would  like  to  acknowledge  their  presence  and  their  achievements   as
representatives of a much wider land  reform  programme  which  is  working.
[Applause.]

One of the focus areas of the President's  speech  today  was  the  role  of
local government in poverty alleviation. Sadly, it is at the level of  local
government that one of the most problematic issues  with  the  potential  to
undo much of the good work that has been done in land  reform,  arises,  and
that is the issue of an agricultural land tax - of course, also with  regard
to traditional land.

It is quite clear that  some  municipalities  are  using  agricultural  land
taxes to balance their budgets and view such taxes  as  an  easy  source  of
revenue. This problem is further compounded by the fact  that  there  is  no
uniform system and that the implementation differs widely from  municipality
to municipality. Some  municipalities  have  charged  as  much  as  7%.  The
implication  for  the  sustainability  of   agriculture,   both   from   the
perspective of  production  and  job  creation,  is  substantial.  Excessive
agricultural land taxes also create an extra barrier to  the  entry  of  new
emerging farmers.

The Government's own Katz Commission produced a report in August  1998  that
very clearly pointed out the dangers of the  introduction  of  such  a  tax,
especially one based on the market value of  agricultural  land  instead  of
the use value.  The  recent  ruling  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeal  in
Bloemfontein has confirmed that,  although  the  Constitution  authorises  a
land tax, there must be uniformity and fairness in its  application.  It  is
being estimated that farm land prices could decline as much  as  6%  to  12%
with a land tax levy at a rate of just 1% to 2%.

I would therefore like to call on the President  urgently  to  consider  the
introduction of a moratorium on the levying of agricultural  land  taxes  by
local governments, also with regard to traditional land, until such time  as
fair  and  equitable   national   guidelines   resulting   from   real   and
comprehensive consultation has been issued to regulate these practices.

In the interim I would like to suggest that the Ministers of Provincial  and
Local Government, Finance and Agriculture urgently convene  a  stakeholders'
forum of agricultural representatives and local governments to discuss  this
issue and find a middle ground which is both fair and sustainable.

Success in South Africa depends on all of our communities  working  together
and strengthening our common South African pride and patriotism. The  recent
spate of bombings in Soweto and other places has been held  up  by  some  as
evidence of how our communities have drifted apart since 1994. One group  in
particular has been very loud in its  expressions  of  frustration  in  this
regard.

The Group of 63  is  a  self-appointed  group  of  Afrikaner  academics  and
intellectuals who proclaim  their  commitment  to  advancing  the  cause  of
Afrikaners and Afrikaans. They took offence after my criticism  of  them  at
the weekend, where they called on President Mbeki to analyse what they  call
Afrikaner alienation as a reason for these bombings, allegedly the  work  of
right-wing Afrikaners.

Organisations like the Group of 63 are self-appointed and do  not  speak  on
behalf  of  any   substantial   Afrikaner   grouping   or   even   Afrikaans
intellectuals. [Interjections.] The way to deal  with  frustrations  in  the
Afrikaner community is to do what the New NP is doing: Become  part  of  the
mainstream and put  constructive  views  on  the  table  where  they  count,
advancing the interests of all South Africans.

According to the Group of 63's own documentation, their  advisory  committee
consists of - and I must say they  are  respected  people,  respected  South
Africans - people like Prof Johan Degenaar, Prof  Lawrence  Schlemmer,  Prof
Hermann Gilliomee, Prof David Welsh and Dr Van Zyl Slabbert.  I  would  like
to call on these people to distance themselves from both the  statement  and
the approach of this Group of 63. Once one starts on this road of  carefully
worded apologies for violence, there is no turning back.

Ons moenie aan randgroepe soos hierdie erkenning verleen, dat  hulle  namens
enige betekenisvolle groep Afrikaners of Afrikaanssprekendes praat nie.  Dit
is nie die geval nie. Mense wat die wet oortree, moet met die  volle  omvang
en die wese van die gereg te doen kry. (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraph

[We must not recognise these peripheral groups, that they  speak  on  behalf
of any significant group of Afrikaners or Afrikaans-speaking  persons.  This
is not the case. People who break the law must be faced with the full  scope
and substance of the law.]

If frustration is an excuse to plant bombs,  let  us  compare  frustrations.
There are many  people  with  frustrations  in  this  country:  frustrations
because they are still waiting for running water;  frustrations  because  it
takes longer to build houses than we all  initially  expected;  frustrations
because we are not creating jobs at the  rate  we  would  like  them  to  be
created; and frustrations because some parents in this country do  not  know
where and how they will provide their children with a proper meal.

Despite these frustrations, these are not the  people  planting  bombs.  The
people planting these bombs are doctors, lawyers and professionals -  people
who have had the opportunity to study at university. Groups like  the  Group
of 63 should  reconsider  the  whole  basis  of  their  argument  and  their
approach. They are not doing the  cause  of  Afrikaners  and  Afrikaans  any
good. They are  doing  more  harm  than  good  by  becoming  apologists  for
violence.

The reaction of the FF, represented in this Parliament, was essentially  the
same as that  of  the  Group  of  63.  Although  they  pay  lip  service  to
opposition to violence, they then continue to build the  arguments  for  why
these so-called frustrations lead to such acts.

Under our electoral system, we do not have any thresholds for parties to  be
represented in Parliament. Other countries with  similar  electoral  systems
have a cut-off of 3% to 5%. The idea in South Africa is that we should  make
it easy for parties to be represented in Parliament and to  put  their  case
here. Parties should not be allowed to abuse the freedom and the  protection
of Parliament to  become  apologists  for  undemocratic  behaviour  and  the
planting of bombs. [Interjections.]

In conclusion, the coalition government within the Western Cape  is  working
well. We are living up to our commitment to breathe life into the  words  of
our Constitution and to live our Constitution. We are illustrating  that  it
is possible for blacks, coloureds, whites and Indians to not  only  tolerate
each other, but to be successful together. That is what we will continue  to
do. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTH WEST (Dr P S Molefe): Hon  Chairperson,  President,
hon members and premiers, may  I  thank  the  President  for  being  such  a
visionary leader who constantly focuses the  minds  of  all  of  us  on  the
critical questions  facing  us  all,  particularly  the  question  of  local
government, and the question of poverty, reminding us of  the  real  purpose
for which we exist as politicians and as the National Council of Provinces.

We  thank  the  President  again  for  raising  the  issue  of   traditional
authorities. I would like to say that, as far as the North West province  is
concerned, the message that we bring to everyone else is that there will  be
no confrontation on dealing with the issue of traditional authorities;  that
they understand that the critical issues that we have to confront are  those
that relate to the delivery of services to our people. As the  President  is
aware, we are awaiting a date from his office as to when he will join us  in
publicly  announcing  a   partnership   of   traditional   authorities   and
municipalities  in  development  of   our   communities.   That   indicates,
therefore, a common commitment to changing the lives of our people  for  the
better.

The President's speech today demonstrated  eloquently  that  with  each  day
that goes by our relatively young democracy matures,  that  more  than  ever
before, as a nation and as a people, we are continuing to reap  the  rewards
of our hard-earned democracy. Gradually, the dark clouds of  pessimism  that
were the hallmark of our society for many years are now being replaced by  a
spirit of optimism. There is optimism that  the  legacy  of  many  years  of
apartheid and colonial rule is being eroded, and optimism  that  the  battle
to banish poverty, ignorance and general want is being  won.  Indeed,  eight
years  into  our  democratic  state  South  Africa  is  already  playing   a
meaningful role in the global arena. Increasingly world leaders are  looking
to South Africa to provide leadership on a  number  of  critical  challenges
facing the world.

Fully aware and convinced that our survival as  a  country  is  inextricably
linked to that of the African continent and indeed the whole world, we  have
responded with the necessary energy and zeal to the tasks placed upon us  by
the international community. Our  role  in  the  formation  of  the  African
Union, and in the New Partnership for Africa's Development, as well  as  our
participation in a number of international forums, bears testimony to  this.
Now for all this we are thankful for the  President's  visionary  leadership
to our country and to our continent.

I would like to focus my speech this afternoon on the  following  two  areas
that I think  are  of  critical  importance,  namely  local  government  and
poverty alleviation and infrastructure development and poverty alleviation.

The democratic Government inherited a system of local government  rooted  in
a philosophy that was elitist, discriminatory and not geared to meeting  the
developmental  needs  of  the  new  dispensation.  This  system   of   local
government  created  cities  of  contrasts,  where  pockets  of  wealth  and
opulence were surrounded by a sea of poverty and  deprivation.  Fully  aware
that this system was not only immoral, but also structurally  deficient,  we
as the democratic Government set ourselves  the  goal  of  transforming  our
local government system. As Government we consciously  took  a  decision  to
position local government at the centre of the delivery of services  to  our
people.  Indeed,  our  new  local  government  dispensation  clearly   gives
expression to our vision of a  developmental  local  government  system.  It
positions this sphere of government at the cutting edge  of  the  battle  to
push back the frontiers of poverty.

Of even more significance is that our new system  of  local  government  has
ushered in an era of  integrated  planning  and  co-ordination  amongst  the
various spheres of government.  Integrated  planning  and  co-ordination  is
important in that it not only  ensures  that  duplication  in  the  delivery
process is eliminated, but also ensures that we use the least  resources  to
achieve maximum gains. Integrated planning and  co-ordination  also  ensures
that services are delivered in the most efficient and sustainable manner.

I am pleased to report to this House that in the North West province we  are
beginning to reap the  rewards  of  integrated  planning  and  co-ordination
amongst various spheres of government. Through integrated planning  and  co-
ordination in the North West province we are lending a hand in the  national
effort  to  roll  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.  The  success  we  have
registered so far in the implementation of the integrated rural  development
programme in the Kgalagadi district is a direct result  of  the  integration
of planning amongst the various spheres of government.  Let  me  remind  hon
members that the Kgalagadi district, which is located in one of the  poorest
areas of our country, has been designated as  a  presidential  developmental
node.

Progress made in the Kgalagadi district has led  to  the  identification  of
projects worth R170 million and we have added another R7 million  to  assist
them. I am pleased to report that about 90% of these  projects  are  already
in progress. These projects are directly aimed at  poverty  alleviation  and
unleashing the economic potential  of  the  Kgalagadi  area.  Indeed,  these
projects will go a long way in bringing a  better  life  to  the  people  of
Kgalagadi.

But what is unique about Kgalagadi is the fact that  it  is  situated  in  a
cross-boundary municipality. The uniqueness of this project  emphasises  the
need  and  importance  of  integrated  planning  amongst  all   spheres   of
government. I have said previously that I think it is emerging  as  a  model
that all of us will have a lot to learn from.

Hon Surty has urged us to review the system of  cross-boundary  municipality
boundaries because  of  the  complex  nature  that  it  represents  and  the
difficulties that it has. The hon member will be pleased to  know  that  the
President's Council - which is led by the President and where  all  premiers
and the Minister for Provincial and Local Government participate  -  decided
at its recent meeting,  and  unanimously  so,  that  the  system  of  cross-
boundary municipalities is unworkable and needs to be done  away  with,  and
that the provincial boundaries should be accordingly adjusted to  meet  this
objective. So we are expecting that, between  the  Minister  for  Provincial
and Local Government and the provinces, processes will be put in  motion  to
identify specific steps that need to be taken in order for us to rapidly  do
away with this system of cross-boundary municipalities so that we can  speed
up service delivery.

Let me now move on to the issue of infrastructural development  and  poverty
alleviation. As a result  of  the  prudent  manner  in  which  our  national
economy has been managed, a lot  of  funds  have  been  made  available  for
infrastructure development. This development is to be welcomed and  will  no
doubt assist the provinces and  municipalities  to  begin  to  confront  the
challenges  of  infrastructure  development,  as  well  as  push  back   the
frontiers of poverty.

The bulk of provincial governments' infrastructure spending is dedicated  to
alleviating social problems in the  areas  of  education,  health  and  road
construction. Infrastructure spending,  particularly  in  rural  areas,  not
only creates much-needed job opportunities, but also ensures that  essential
services are delivered to our people. Only last week, I  was  in  a  village
called Makabetlwane, where we were handing over a water project  costing  R5
million to a community of 3 500 people. This community had lived  there  for
94 years, during which they had to drink water with donkeys and  cattle,  in
a pit.

A year ago, they decided to bring the water in a bucket into  my  office  to
show what kind of water they had been drinking for 94  years.  We  responded
rapidly and we gave  them  that  project.  It  was  an  emotionally  charged
atmosphere that we experienced when we handed over the project, but  I  also
noticed among those people that there was a high  level  of  optimism.  They
were positive, they understood the challenges facing the country,  they  did
not expect everything to happen at once and they were  prepared  for  us  to
deal with issues step by step.

I want to tell the President that that day I wanted to  call  him  and  tell
him a positive story for once, so that we do not tell him problems  all  the
time. Unfortunately, the President was in Cambodia and I could not give  him
a call. [Laughter.] But I am telling him this to say that those who keep  on
saying that  people  are  angry  and  alienated  and  do  not  support  this
Government, that they are frustrated, etc, do not  reflect  the  reality  on
the ground. People  have  problems,  but  they  also  understand  that  this
Government is dealing with  those  problems.  So  I  thought  the  President
needed to know that, because it is good that sometimes  we  give  him  leave
from those things that stress him, and tell him positive stories.

I think that it is this kind of infrastructure, therefore, that  gives  hope
to our people that the battle against poverty is being won. I am  concluding
now, and in concluding I would like to take  this  opportunity  to  wish  my
successor,  Premier  Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk,  well  for  the  future  and
congratulate him on his election as the rotating chairperson of the NCOP.  I
also congratulate him  on  his  election  as  the  leader  of  the  New  NP.
Similarly, I would like to congratulate  my  colleague  the  hon  Makhenkesi
Stofile on his re-election as the leader of the ANC in the Eastern Cape.

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, mnr die President,  ``Saam  wen  Suid-Afrika''.
Dit was die tema van die suksesvolle en entoesiastiese federale kongres  van
die Nuwe NP die pas afgelope naweek. Dit is  ons  boodskap  aan  elke  Suid-
Afrikaner. Ons het gekies om by te dra tot die bou van  ons  nasie,  nie  om
van die kantlyn af te skreeu nie, soos die DP/DA. (Translation of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, Mr President, ``Together South Africa  wins''.
This was the theme of the successful and enthusiastic  federal  congress  of
the New NP this past  weekend.  This  is  our  the  message  to  each  South
African. We chose to contribute to building our nation,  and  not  to  shout
from the sideline, like the DP/DA.]

We in the New NP want to say that the problems and  challenges  of  poverty,
crime, HIV/Aids and unemployment, which  our  country  and  our  people  are
faced with are our problems and our challenges. We will, in the interest  of
all our people, and with all the strength at our disposal,  enthusiastically
to whatever it takes to help to resolve these  problems.  Everything  in  us
revolts against the DP/DA attitude of what is bad for the  country  is  good
for the DA and of  their  being  possessed  of  the  idea  of  opposing  and
criticising at all costs without doing anything  themselves  to  help  solve
the problems of our country and our people.

In 1994 het ons 'n politieke wonderwerk beleef met  'n  ongekende  gees  van
samewerking en die beginsels van  ubuntu.  In  1996  het  die  Regering  van
Nasionale Eenheid egter misluk omdat ons aan beide kante nog nie daarin  kon
slaag om saam die nuwe uitdagings van ons land te aanvaar nie. Mnre  Mandela
en De Klerk het die bouproses begin. Dit lÃª egter nou op ons weg om  daardie
bouproses verder te neem en uiteindelik te voltooi. Ons het die  eenvoudige,
maar kragtige, waarheid herontdek, naamlik dat ons slegs 'n sukses  van  ons
land kan maak as ons almal saamwerk. Ten spyte van verskille is  daar  slegs
een  pad  na  sukses,  en  dit  is  die  pad  van  samewerking  op  al   die
regeringsvlakke in die belang van al ons mense.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[In 1994 we experienced a political miracle with an unprecedented spirit  of
co-operation and the  principles  of  ubuntu.  In  1996  the  Government  of
National Unity failed, however,  because  on  both  sides  we  had  not  yet
succeeded in together accepting the new challenges of  our  country.  Messrs
Mandela and De Klerk started the building process. It is our destiny now  to
take this process of building further and  eventually  to  complete  it.  We
have rediscovered this simple, but powerful truth, namely, that we can  only
make a success of  our  country  if  we  all  work  together.  In  spite  of
differences there is only one road to success, and this is the road  of  co-
operation at every level of government in the interests of all our people.]

Minority communities have a choice. The one choice is to  fight  back.  This
is the old recipe of  opposition  at  all  costs  and  the  exploitation  of
minority fears. It is a message filled with pessimism  and  the  destructive
potential of isolation and division. The other choice,  our  choice,  offers
hope and relevance. We now have the opportunity ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, Order!

Mr P A MATTHEE: ... to break out of our divided history and to walk  through
the door of the new South  Africa,  together.  We  say:  Let  us  fight  the
differences. We as South Africans have enough in common  to  be  co-builders
and in the interests of our people it is better together to  find  solutions
to the challenges that we as a nation face than  to  continue  opposing  one
another for the sake of opposition to the detriment of our people.

The simple truth is that if this ship called South Africa  should  sink,  we
all sink together. It would not help to  blame  the  captain.  There  is  no
point in cursing the darkness of crime, poverty, HIV/Aids and  unemployment.
We must together shine as bright a light as possible in order to drive  away
the darkness of the problems facing us.  We  know  that  the  proof  of  the
pudding lies in the eating and we have already  produced  tangible  results.
As hon members have heard from the speech of our leader, the results of  co-
operative  governance  are  already  starting  to  show  for  all  to   see,
especially at this stage in the Western Cape. However, soon it  will  be  so
all over the country, because together South Africa wins.

The PREMIER OF MPUMALANGA (Mr N J Mahlangu): Mr Chairperson, His  Excellency
our President, hon premiers and hon members, thank you for  the  opportunity
to share with the Council a few ideas about  how  we  are  doing  things  in
Mpumalanga.

As we gather here today, as servants of the people, we can look back at  the
past year as a year of great achievements which have been brought  about  by
our commitment to effective implementation of government programmes and  the
delivery of services that respond to  the  needs  and  expectations  of  our
people. Our people understand and support our programmes, because they  know
that these programmes will ensure that they move further away  from  poverty
and suffering, towards a better quality of life.

In the imbizos and in our community outreach programmes, our people told  us
that our  basic  policies  are  sound.  But  they  also  told  us  that  the
mechanisms for delivery and the visible impact on poverty in  terms  of  how
it affects the lives of women, youth, rural communities  and  people  living
on farms must be accelerated. They said we should  do  this  through  better
integration and co-ordination  of  infrastructure  delivery.  We  are  doing
that, but the people want us to improve on that.

Soon  after  the  1999  elections,  the  Mpumalanga  provincial   government
determined the following as basic priorities which must guide  the  delivery
of service in our province, which is a predominantly  rural  province:  that
economic growth must result in job creation; and to establish effective  and
efficient financial management, effective and efficient  administration  and
integrated and co-ordinated service delivery.

In order to give effect to the economic growth which should  result  in  job
creation, during the past three years we have facilitated the  establishment
of economic fora in each  municipal  and  district  council  area.  We  have
already established  economic  fora  in  all  our  municipalities,  and  are
finalising district  and  local  economic  fora.  We  plan  to  establish  a
provincial economic forum consisting of representatives  from  our  district
economic fora.

The main function of these economic fora is to look at the opportunities  of
economic  growth  in  their  respective  areas,  such  as  tourism,  mining,
agriculture  and  the  manufacturing  industries.  As  a  result  of   these
activities of the economic fora, we were able to resuscitate  many  business
complexes,  industries  and  enterprises  which  are  still  viable.   These
business undertakings are those  which  were  financed  by  our  parastatals
before 1994.
We have also established a team  of  experts,  under  the  leadership  of  a
deputy  director-general  in  the  premier's  office,  to  ensure  that  all
departments comply with  both  financial  and  administrative  rules.  These
processes have eliminated corruption,  theft  and  laxity  at  work  in  our
province.

We have established four cabinet clusters, ie governance,  social,  economic
and criminal justice. Executive district municipalities  and  the  executive
mayors and councillors of these structures are participating  in  all  these
clusters. Cluster  meetings  are  held  once  a  month.  These  clusters  of
provincial departments and municipalities ensure that  their  daily  service
delivery service programmes are co-ordinated and integrated.

These clusters are preceded by cluster technical  committees  consisting  of
provincial  heads  of  department  and  town   managers   of   participating
municipalities. The function of these technical  committees  is  to  prepare
the scope and agenda of each cluster. During  the  planning  stages  of  the
integrated   development   programme   of   our   district   councils,   the
municipalities  of  a  particular  district  participate  and  align   their
individual integrated development programme  to  their  respective  district
council.

In turn, all heads of provincial departments participate in the  drawing  up
of integrated development plans - IDPs - of all our  district  councils  and
they make sure that their yearly programmes are aligned to these IDPs.  This
process also helps to capacitate both our local municipalities and  district
councils in drawing up their integrated development plans.

We are also studying a new process  in  terms  of  which  each  MEC  in  our
province will hold regular meetings with a  representative  councillor  from
each municipality in our province to allow information flow and further  co-
ordination with the provincial government. We also have a  structure  called
the Mpumalanga Intergovernmental Relations Forum which is aimed at  ensuring
that there is a co-ordinated  development  approach  between  the  different
spheres of government in the province, attended by the mayor and chaired  by
the premier.

We are looking at improving the structure in order for it to be  similar  to
the President's co-ordinating council so that  information  flows  from  the
PCC down to municipalities at once during the  session  of  this  forum.  In
this way we believe we shall eventually have a totally  integrated  and  co-
ordinated service delivery for our people.

We are continuing to strengthen and expand on our relations with our  sister
provinces  in  neighbouring  countries.  For  example,  in   Swaziland   and
Mozambique we already have agreements. Through these  interactions  we  hope
to attract investment into our province which  will  provide  jobs  for  the
unemployed and create revenue for the province. We are  convinced  that  the
African Renaissance, as a vision, aims to bring an end to wars  and  violent
conflicts in our continent. We must at this stage condemn the  uncalled  for
bombing by certain people who do not believe in  our  democratic  system  of
governing and elections.
We will continue to address the backlog on  a  sustainable  basis  in  water
supply, access to basic sanitation and free basic water. However, one  needs
to state that we are currently experiencing an unprecedented water  shortage
in all the former homeland areas in our province.

During the past  four  or  five  years,  in  the  Nkangala  district,  which
includes the former KwaNdebele area and part of  the  former  Bophuthatswana
area, people have at times been without water for more than five  months  in
a year. Black emerging farmers in these areas are worried that  their  white
counterparts across the road have a good supply of  water  while  they  have
none.

The same shortage of water is experienced  in  the  Ehlanzeni  districts  in
areas such as Nkomazi, Albert Luthulu, Nsikazi  and  surrounding  areas,  as
well as in Moutse East and West, and so do the rural  residential  areas  of
Groblersdal which form part of cross-border Sekhukhune. In all these  areas,
there is virtually no water. In the former  homeland  areas  there  is  very
little supply, which is a very hopeless situation at this stage, because  at
the time when bulk water supply was  provided,  the  population  figure  was
very low. At present it is almost more than six times what it  was  at  that
time, and water is therefore a problem.

We are talking to the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry in order  for
them either to upgrade the bulk water supply system  or  to  install  a  new
one. We are appealing for assistance from the national Government.  We  have
put money aside in order to upgrade water reticulation in all  the  affected
areas, but we can go so far. The bulk water supply is a problem. A new  bulk
water supply system or the upgrading of the existing one is important.

We are humbly appealing to  the  hon  President  and  the  Cabinet  of  this
country, while we are dealing with the Department of Water Affairs,  to  use
their big hand to come to our rescue. This is a  situation  under  which  no
human being can live. Of course, the people are still patient despite  these
hardships in which they  find  themselves.  There  is  no  apathy,  but  the
difficulty is visible and one can almost touch it.

We believe that if these matters were to be addressed, people  could  really
find joy, as they continue to do so. Of course, there are  opportunists  who
believe that the shortage of water is deliberate, whereas it is  because  of
the increase in the population that we have  this  serious  shortage.  As  I
said, we are dealing with it in terms of water reticulation, but bulk  water
supply needs a few million rands to be made  available.  It  would  be  very
helpful if during the next six months we could  have  this  injection  as  a
result of our interaction with the national Government. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF  THE  EASTERN  CAPE  (Rev  M  A  Stofile):  Chairperson,  His
Excellency the President of the  Republic  of  South  Africa,  hon  members,
colleagues, let me join my other  colleagues  in  congratulating,  first  of
all, the second Deputy Chairperson, Mr  Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk,  recently
elected to that post by us. It was inspiring to listen  to  his  input  just
now, also linking up with what my colleague Manne Dipico  had  already  said
about Mr Van Schalkwyk's leadership in the field of co-operation amongst  us
as neighbouring provinces. I truly believe that  we  have  a  worthy  Deputy
Chairperson, and that the Western Cape has made  a  very  good  choice  this
time. Congratulations to Marthinus.

I would also like to congratulate the new Deputy Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,
Mr Mahlangu, and indeed congratulate the NCOP itself for a  very  innovative
stance when it undertook what seemed like a very difficult  task  of  taking
Parliament to the far rural areas of  our  countryside.  Congratulations  to
both Chairperson Pandor and  Mr  Mushwana  who,  despite  all  the  dangers,
attended this initiative. The threats were so many,  and  yet  they  gritted
their teeth and forged ahead with our co-operation. I  wish  to  thank  them
very much, and may God assist them ... [Applause.]

The rate of poverty and hunger in our province - and, indeed,  in  the  rest
of South Africa - and the world has been adequately documented. It  is  very
inspiring to see how our own President zeroed  in  on  that  very  important
challenge when he made his speech to us this afternoon.  The  President  may
not realise how inspiring it is for him to touch on the very things that  we
believe should be the focus of our provincial and  local  planning,  because
where we come from it is based on what we see every day in our lives.

This has compelled us in the province to develop  a  special  plan  to  deal
with this very critical situation. I am pleased to  remind  members  that  I
gave them a copy of our framework in this regard. We believe that we  should
have a massive, rapid food production strategy to deal with both hunger  and
economic development, as well as infrastructural backlogs. This will  access
the economy and the centres where this economy  must  be  developed  through
the people from the rural areas themselves.

To achieve this, we decided that all planning in the province be  guided  by
the municipal IDPs. In this way integrated rural development programmes  can
make a maximum impact and, indeed, save us a whole lot of money as  we  will
use one  basket.  The  thrust  of  our  plans  is  massive  and  rapid  food
production is linked to modernised and mechanised forms of food production.

This will  be  linked,  therefore,  to  the  much-needed  skills  and  human
resource development  that  continue  to  elude  the  rural  people  of  our
communities. It  will  also  be  linked  to  the  improvement  of  the  road
infrastructure, which continues to be the  victim  of  all  these  inclement
weather conditions that have been visiting  us  on  an  annual  basis  since
1995.

As a result, we continue to build roads and bridges but, as we  do  so,  the
rest of our bridges are also beginning to feel the strain. The  average  age
of our bridges is now 50 years, and as such they are all beginning  to  need
attention. So, as disasters hit us we begin to panic because our  plans  for
the refurbishing of the old bridges are also being delayed.

The C-Map programmes play  a  very  significant  role  in  using  the  local
authorities and their IDPs to help in the infrastructural provisioning.  Not
only do the projects create infrastructure or improve it  where  it  exists,
but they also create jobs for locals and provide assistance to  SMMEs.  They
assist communities to overcome gender  prejudices  as  both  men  and  women
begin to work side by side in the rural areas. This  is  usually  taken  for
granted in the cities, but, believe me, it is still a huge challenge in  the
countryside.

All  our  communities  are  also  learning  to  own  these   projects.   The
disillusionment with Government projects  and  alienation  is  beginning  to
recede as people are consulted and begin to participate in the planning  and
implementation of these projects.

There are myriads of examples of where this is happening,  but  perhaps  the
most outstanding is the Umtata peri-urban water supply scheme  which  covers
43 villages.  There  you  have  communities  themselves  establishing  water
committees to decide where  these  projects  should  be  located,  how  they
should be managed and how they should be sustained.

We also have a very interesting  project  which  provides  access  to  water
purification by using mobile mechanisms in those parts of  our  rural  areas
where people simply refuse to come down from the mountain. Members know  how
people build on these mountain-tops to run away from  the  battles  and  the
wars. They are now refusing  to  come  down.  We  have  developed  motorbike
systems to access those areas and purify their water right  there.  This  is
not genius on our part, but comes from the military outfit  -  we  are  told
this is what they have used all these years. We have also adapted  these  to
become mobile stretchers for patients who cannot be  accessed  by  motorcars
or ambulances, and also for taking medicines to those  clinics  that  cannot
otherwise be accessed by ambulance.

The  Umzimkulu  bus-route   project   focuses   on   local   people   taking
responsibility for the maintenance of their own roads,  so  that  the  money
which would otherwise have gone to consultants and contractors  go  directly
into their pockets. Commensurate with that,  their  skills  for  maintaining
their roads are improving and the taxi industry  is  beginning  to  have  an
easier time.

The Peddie-Ngqushwa pineapple project, which was started  three  years  ago,
has begun to impress all of us by the size and  quality  of  the  pineapples
that it has produced in its first year of harvest. The Qumbu waste  disposal
site, which reduces the contact of children with contaminated  environments,
has not only reduced the stench, but has also protected  our  children  from
being exposed to diseases that are related to these waste  dumps  that  have
always been their playground. They can now find safer playgrounds away  from
unnecessary contamination.

There are other examples, Chair, but we do  not  want  to  bother  you  with
these lists. In this way millions of rand go into  the  income  of  our  own
people and we are thus beginning, in one way or another,  to  contribute  to
the pushing back of the frontiers of poverty and starvation.
This also sees the beginning of infrastructure coming into  existence  where
before it never existed. We must  concede,  however,  that  unless  we  very
strenuously  develop  local  economic  development  strategies,  all   these
projects are not going to be sustainable. We are pleased  to  announce  that
the Umzimkulu district municipality seems to lead the whole country in  this
respect. They have produced an LED which  simply  cannot  be  surpassed.  It
does not matter where the others come from, this LED is simply something  to
learn from.

We want to confirm that we have been consistent in the strengthening of  our
intergovernmental forum,  something  we  reported  on  here  two  years  ago
already.  We  have  expanded  that  to  include  not  only  our   provincial
departments, but also the national departments. We want to  urge  those  who
are still hesitant to participate in this  initiative.  They  should  really
feel free because this is not about the turf, but about how best we can  use
the resources of our country. After all when everything is  said  and  done,
all of us are trying to solve the problems and transform  the  socioeconomic
situation of the same communities.

We have not been relenting on trying to push back the  backlogs  of  clinics
and classrooms. On average, since 1997 we have been building an  average  of
850 classrooms per year, but believe me, we have not overcome this  backlog.
But we are not daunted. We believe that one  day  we  shall  do  what  other
provinces take for granted, ie provide suitable classrooms for the  children
of our country. We are convinced that, together, we can do it.

The last word must go to the national Government,  which  has  continued  in
the last few years to  participate  in  peace  initiatives  on  the  African
continent and, indeed, in the rest of the world. We cannot agree  more  with
the President that the tensions and disagreements of world communities  will
best be solved by negotiations. We do not want to  see  bloodshed  all  over
the streets of South Africa and the rest of the world. We  think  everything
should be done to solve these problems through negotiations.
We are absolutely confident that our own Government  will  smash  all  those
negative elements of society who  continue  to  plant  bombs  all  over  the
countryside with  the  hope  of  intimidating  our  people.  They  will  not
intimidate our people, who are confident that their own  Government  -  and,
indeed, themselves - will be able to  identify  these  elements  and  ferret
them out.

We support one hundred per cent  the  view  that  the  United  Nations  must
seriously consider the integrity  of  other  nations  even  when  there  are
tensions among these nations. We should never be tempted  to  undermine  the
integrity of other people. And once we accept that,  we  would  then  accept
the fact that it is only through negotiating as equals  that  we  can  solve
our problems.

Mr M V MOOSA: Mr Chairperson, hon Chairperson of the NCOP, hon premiers  and
colleagues, increasing the economic prosperity  for  all  occupies  a  focal
point on our path to fully liberate our people from the legacy of the past.

A  number  of  speakers  today,  including  the  hon  the  President,   have
underscored the integral nature of delivering our people  from  poverty  and
disempowerment. Indeed, as chairperson of  economic  affairs  for  the  past
three-and-a-half years, one has learned  that  although  much  progress  has
been  made  on  broad-based  economic   empowerment   and   black   economic
empowerment, this still remains a major deliverable  with  many  hurdles  to
cross.

To truly deliver freedom  to  our  people,  we  have  to  deliver  real  and
meaningful participation for them at the core of the economy.  Black  people
are currently at best nibbling at the fringes of the economy.

I am sorry, but  my  pages  are  a  little  bit  mixed  up.  There  we  are!
[Interjections.] I did number them, but somehow they came loose. Excuse  me,
I have to fix this! Do I need to  renumber  them?  Raju,  did  you  take  my
pages? [Laughter.]

Mr N M RAJU: I would not sabotage you, you are my friend!
Mr M V MOOSA: He is not sabotaging me! [Interjections.]

Chair, recent figures indicate that  black  ownership  on  the  Johannesburg
Stock Exchange has declined from 8% in 1998 to  2%  in  2002.  Ownership  by
black people has reversed substantially in our economy.  Yet  last  Thursday
the Business Day carried a headline to the effect that black  ownership  was
higher than expected. The article went on to gleefully quote the present  2%
figure. In  this  vein  we  congratulate  Mr  Tokyo  Sexwale  of  Mvelapanda
Holdings for being awarded the  Top  Company  of  the  Year  award,  and  Mr
Patrice Motsepe for achieving the Businessperson of the Year award.

While this news generated excitement and pride in all of  us,  one  has  not
been able to escape the strange Business  Day  headline,  nine  years  after
liberation, and the seeming pride with which they report the story  that  we
have made significant progress in black economic empowerment  at  the  level
of 2%. The 6% decline was a  direct  result  of  old-style  SPV  empowerment
models, the translated real ownership being located with finances and  banks
rather than with black shareholders.

Although the recent banking charter discussions  are  positive,  most  black
business funding models are still driven  by  market-growth  related  models
that result in a situation where, if the markets do not perform  adequately,
black shareholders lose their shareholding to the banks. In these  instances
it is the banking institutions that really have operational control.

This is a bizarre model because what it has been saying all  along  is  that
if one's shareholder value increases over time, one may be able to take  the
ownership. But one, in fact, has  no  operational  control  to  do  anything
about the shareholder value increasing.

So in 1998 when the markets were high, we had 8% value in the  economy,  but
four years later,  when  the  markets  are  down,  we  have  2%,  and  black
businesspeople who bought shares  have  not  been  able  to  drive  them  up
because they have had no control over those shares.

That model has not worked and, increasingly, it has become necessary for  us
to try and see if we cannot find new funding models. We  cannot  be  lulled,
therefore, by the Business Day headlines that the success of Mr Sexwale  and
Mr Patrice Motsepe leaves us with great progress and few  challenges  ahead.
One such challenge, therefore, is to build funding models,  particularly  in
the new  initiatives  in  mining  and  so  forth,  that  will  deliver  real
operational control and black economic empowerment to our people.

I plan to leave Parliament, as many of the  members  know,  and  I  will  be
spending much of my time  in  the  coming  months  working  with  identified
financial institutions and experts,  including  an  international  bank,  to
build  new  models  that  scrutinise  these  processes  and   truly   create
empowerment with operational control and involvement for black businesses.

The second major challenge that we face is an area about which I  have  been
passionate for some time now, and that is  the  area  of  small  and  medium
enterprises. The SMMEs are a driving force and a  stimulus  of  our  economy
and, indeed, many economies throughout the world. Some economies are  driven
by SMMEs, so much so that they generate as much as 60% of the GDPs of  those
economies. While we ourselves have done  much  and  the  DTI's  support  for
SMMEs has increased, the scale of this support has not been sufficient.

I have another page that I need to find! [Interjections.]

The growth of the SMMEs sector falls far short of the levels that will  make
an impact on our economy and on the lives of  our  people  as  a  whole.  In
short, only a revolutionary and systemic overhaul will  deliver  significant
and rapid SMME growth and empowerment in the mainstream of our economy.

We have over the past two years been developing business plans,  using  both
IT and other warm-blooded methods of interaction in  both  urban  and  rural
areas to deliver such SMME growth. The interaction  is  to  draw  out  large
corporates, state-owned enterprises and Government structures,  as  well  as
transform their procurement and supply chain  substantially  so  that  SMME-
driven initiatives can find access to those supply chains.

Some aspects of the DTI's plan has already  filtered  some  of  these  ideas
into  SMME  strategies.  But  further  market   interventions,   which   are
fundamental  to  make  meaningful  progress,   are   required   outside   of
Government. This is also an area to which I will dedicate much of my time.

The question of being able to take SMMEs  throughout  the  country  and  put
them in a single national database in order  to  identify  which  SMMEs  are
supplying what services and products to whom,  and  in  what  localities  or
areas, is the only way to enable local authorities, provincial  governments,
government departments and large corporates to find these SMMEs,  pick  them
up and take them into the supply chains.
The  substantial  complaint  at  the  moment,  when   one   approaches   big
corporates, is: ``Where are the SMMEs? We cannot find them.'' And  when  one
approaches SMMEs or goes into  one's  constituency  work,  one  finds  small
businesses that are still saying: ``But what is Government doing for us?''

The fact of the matter is that small business are businesses like any  other
business. They are driven by  fundamentals  and  business  principles.  They
want contracts, so that they can be successful. They do not have time to  go
out there looking for tenders, procurements and those  kind  of  things.  We
need to find mechanisms for hand-holding them into those supply  chains  and
processes.

In other words, when a small businessperson opens up  his  store  on  Monday
morning he is concerned as to whether his five workers will  come  to  work,
get his production line moving, get enough stock onto  the  production  line
and make sure that the little factory, shop or business is moving.  He  does
not have time to go onto the computer to read the Business Day and look  for
those kinds of things. This is the kind of interventions that are  required.
These are market-driven interventions and we as  Government  cannot  do  all
that. We have to find market  mechanisms  in  order  to  bring  about  these
interventions.

Finally, in much of these thoughts and engagements, both here  in  the  NCOP
and outside, when I take my leave I remain proud  to  be  one  of  the  most
dynamic political parties and movements in the world today, the ANC.

Sorry, I keep losing my pages. Mr Raju is messing me up! [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  member,  if  you  could
please wind up.

Mr M V MOOSA: I am busy doing that,  Chairperson.  As  this  burning  desire
translates into action, I remain forever linked to  the  complex  fabric  of
parliamentary life that cloaks me like a warm blanket, but which is also  as
solid as  the  foundations  we  have  built  for  a  better  life  for  all.
[Applause.]

The PREMIER OF  KWAZULU-NATAL  (Mr  L  P  H  M  Mtshali):  Chairperson,  His
Excellency, the President of the Republic, hon delegates  to  this  National
Council  of  Provinces,  today  the  President  has  given  this   House   a
comprehensive picture of the status of our nation and correctly  highlighted
the key elements on which its general welfare rests. These key elements  are
mainly centred around our infrastructure development, programme  of  poverty
alleviation, plans for economic growth and sustainable development, and  the
continental  and  international  framework  within  which  our  country   is
pursuing its growth, specifically in regard to Nepad.

A question has been posed regarding  how  provinces  can  help  support  the
President and assist by being  part  of  that  picture.  However,  before  I
formulate a tentative answer to that question, I  would  like  to  focus  on
some aspects of this picture in order to point out that, perhaps,  we  ought
to try to improve the picture before we call on provinces to  contribute  to
it. Our country is locked into a great challenge which arises out of  having
to solve the rural-urban disparity. Rural development is  essential  to  our
country's  success.  Yet,  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural   Development
Strategy has made no allowance for any significant role to be played in  the
formulation  of  development  by  traditional  authorities  and  traditional
leadership which are widely recognised as essential elements in any plan  of
rural development.

While we speak of promoting poverty alleviation and rural  development,  the
conditions are put in place for what could become a  massive  disintegration
of the social fibre of rural  communities  because  of  the  undermining  of
traditional leadership. I wish to quote what the President  told  us  on  12
October 2000 when he spoke to us in this House and I quote him:


  Agreement has been reached that our constitutional and legal  order  has,
  in fact, diminished the powers  that  traditional  authorities  exercised
  prior to the transition to democracy, and that we have to attend to  this
  issue. Our Government is firmly committed to taking all  necessary  steps
  to ensure that the concerns of the traditional leaders are addressed.

That agreement was concretised on 30 November  2000  when  a  delegation  of
Ministers, who represented Cabinet and  were  appointed  by  the  President,
reached an agreement with the coalition of traditional leaders in  terms  of
which  traditional  leaders  waived  their  objection  to  the  holding   of
elections in their areas.

That agreement contained a clear undertaking on the side of  Government  all
of which has, thus far, been dishonoured. The most salient of  those  points
could be stated as follows and I quote:


  Relevant sections of Chapter 7 and 12 of the Constitution will be amended
  to provide for the powers and functions  of  traditional  authorities  in
  local government.

Two years later, not one single step has been taken in that direction.  And,
Government has published a  draft  White  Paper  on  traditional  leadership
which  indicates  that  there  is  no  space  whatsoever   for   traditional
authorities to play any role whatsoever in  the  complex  formula  of  rural
development  or  local  government.  It  goes  so  far  as  to  state   that
traditional authorities ought to be dismantled.

At the same time, legislation has been put through Parliament to  take  away
from traditional leadership the power to allocate, administer and  determine
the use of land in traditional communities. Irrespective of the  ideological
value  which  one  may  wish  to  ascribe  to  this  complex  operation   of
obliteration of traditional leadership, the fact remains that  it  will,  in
all probability, cause the disintegration of an existing model  of  societal
organisation and open the doors to great  poverty,  social  instability  and
disruptive conflicts.

It is very difficult for a province like mine  to  try  to  conduct  poverty
alleviation programmes while the central Government  pulls  the  carpet  out
from under our feet in such a fashion. [Interjections.] As  a  province,  we
believe that infrastructure development must get ahead and  we  support  any
programme of sustainable development.  However,  infrastructure  development
must not be haphazard, but must be the product  of  a  long-term  vision  of
growth and development.

We need to determine what South Africa will look like in the year  2050.  As
a province, we would like to promote greater  development  in  technological
infrastructure and bring  about  a  profound  change  in  our  use  of  land
resources so that we can shift towards crops with higher added  value  which
are more labour intensive and less capital intensive. We would also like  to
see greater development of infrastructure  to  support  the  growth  of  the
tourism industry, amongst which should be the more expedited development  of
the King Shaka Airport.

However, it is difficult for us to pursue our  long-term  vision  of  growth
when our country, as a whole,  does  not  seem  to  have  developed  such  a
vision. We need an enabling framework and more autonomy  at  the  provincial
level. We need the country, as a whole, to  make  a  greater  commitment  to
invest in technology, agricultural and  crop  conversion,  and  tourism.  Or
alternatively, we need to have more powers, resources and  autonomy  for  us
to pursue this long-term  path  of  growth  which  can  capture  the  hidden
economic potential of our province. We can no longer wait.

The situation in our country is rapidly deteriorating as  proven  by  rising
unemployment, inflation and crippling economic recession. We do  not  see  a
clear long-term strategy for economic  growth  being  in  place  to  address
those issues. And, we fear that we are resorting  to  well-meant  and  well-
applied fiscal and financial  discipline  to  deal  with  all  macroeconomic
issues when, in fact, we should go beyond that.

We should not only ask  ourselves  what  we  should  do  to  run  the  state
properly and avoid impairing economic growth. We should have a  strategy  to
stimulate economic growth to the maximum extent possible, at the  provincial
level. We could do it if we had more  powers  and  autonomy  in  respect  of
economic matters. Somebody somewhere must take the  initiative  because  our
people are suffering. They need jobs more than anything else.  That  is  the
main thing that we have not been able to deliver.

We must serve the interests of our people  above  that  of  any  ideological
imperative. I am very concerned about how we relate  the  interests  of  our
people to Nepad. The failure to embrace,  fully  support  and  advocate  the
need for good governance and peer review as essential elements of Nepad  can
make Nepad dead on  arrival.  There  cannot  be  any  long-term  development
without strong and ever-growing democracy.

The promotion of democracy in Africa must be the core of Nepad.  That  means
that we must  have  the  courage  to  call  tyrants  by  name  and  denounce
corruption, poor governance and malfeasance in office  anywhere  in  Africa.
We can no longer deal  with  African  countries  by  applying  standards  to
assess their democracy, freedom and  liberty  which  are  lower  than  those
which we employ in respect  of  our  own  country.  It  is  a  condescending
attitude which will find no place in the comity of African countries.

In the end, if Nepad is dead on arrival, because of Africa's  self-inflicted
injuries, our people will suffer.  Our  country  is  already  financing  the
disaster into which Zimbabwe has fallen because of  its  lack  of  democracy
and its breakaway from the rule  of  law  and  the  community  of  civilised
nations. We are giving electricity to Zimbabwe at a much  lower  price  than
we sell it to our own people. [Interjections.]  We  are  carrying  huge  and
unpaid debts of Zimbabwe. We are confronted now with the need  of  providing
massive  financial  support  to  the  people  of  Zimbabwe,  including  free
distribution of maize in order to avoid famine. Undoubtedly, we need  to  do
that and I am in total support of it. But, we must not  close  our  eyes  to
the causes. It is not a natural disaster. It is a  man-made  disaster  which
stems out of those roots of tyranny, corruption and oppression  which  Nepad
must be committed to eradicate if we are, indeed, to give  any  credence  to
our notion of any type of African Renaissance.

We must also consider, carefully, where our  country  should  stand  in  the
community of nations. We are a civilised country  which  wants  to  progress
and prosper. We are genuinely committed to democracy. We believe  that  only
through democracy will long-term development be sustainable and  achievable.
Internationally,  our  role  should  be  that   of   promoting   sustainable
development  through  the  promotion  of  democracy.  Those  two  things  go
together. One remains puzzled when  suggestions  are  made  that  we  should
befriend regimes which oppress their people and neighbours. In the end,  our
entire country receives the stigma of the pariah  countries  with  which  we
are associated or defend.

My province is committed to attracting foreign investment.  [Interjections.]
We need to shift emphasis from foreign investment to foreign  investors  and
realise that foreign investors are citizens  of  civilised,  prosperous  and
progressive countries who wish to find, in  South  Africa,  an  ally  and  a
friend committed to following the same path which  brought  their  countries
to their prosperity. If we are serious about attracting foreign  investment,
we  need  to  make  some  major   corrections   to   our   foreign   policy.
[Interjections.] Even a premier,  such  as  I  am,  ends  up  having  to  be
confronted with our position on Iraq when we sit with foreign investors  and
try to reassure them that KwaZulu-Natal is a safe place  for  them  to  make
long-term investment.

We must also be genuinely committed  to  promoting  democracy  within  South
Africa. Democracy is never achieved and we  should  not  fall  prey  to  the
illusion of believing that we are above  the  temptation  of  impairing  the
growth of democracy merely because we are  the  generation  which  delivered
liberation and democracy to South Africa. I am a premier who serves  on  the
strength of a mandate received from the electorate which certain people  are
trying  to  change  by  means  of   legislation   rather   than   elections.
[Interjections.] [Applause.] I do not know whether I will  be  participating
in this debate in the same capacity next year. I only know that if the  dark
clouds of a one-party  state,  achieved  not  through  the  ballot  box  but
imposed through tampering with the Constitution, descend upon South  Africa,
we might be witnessing with impotence the commencement of a  long  and  dark
season of democratic involution. The stagnation of democracy will spell  the
stagnation of development. [Interjections.] That is an axiom to which  there
is overwhelming evidence throughout our  continent  and  in  the  world.  We
stand on the  edge  of  a  slippery  downhill  path  towards  a  mixture  of
increased economic recession,  unemployment,  democratic  stagnation  and  a
possible one-party state. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

The PREMIER: Chairperson, we must turn that around here  and  now,  not  for
our sake  but  for  the  sake  of  the  people  we  serve.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

The PREMIER OF GAUTENG (Mr M  S  Shilowa):  Chairperson,  Premier  Mtshali's
speech will, indeed, be a hard act to follow! [Laughter.]
Chairperson, President of the Republic,  hon  members,  I  have  with  me  a
speech which is available for distribution, so I am not going  to  read  it,
but rather speak to it. Let me start by saying, some people were  asking  me
what goodies are in the little bags that we have been giving out. There  are
no goodies in  them,  it  is  mainly  the  Gauteng  women's  directory.  The
programme focused on children, our mid-term report and  the  annual  report.
We thought we should make that available as part of our commitment  to  peer
review that was being spoken about. [Applause.]

I must  say  that  our  province  has  no  difficulty  in  driving  economic
activity, because our approach is not to wait  for  national  Government  to
develop a plan of action for economic activity in the province. We sit  down
and look at the challenges facing Gauteng, because no province is the  same.
This being our challenge, what is it that we need to do to deal  with  those
particular issues? We look at the  integrated  development  plans  of  local
government and out of that approach the relevant Ministries and say, ``As  a
province we think the focus must be IT;  we  think  the  focus  must  be  on
issues of economic development in terms of tourism and so forth.  These  are
the areas around which we seek support.''

So while my colleague from KwaZulu-Natal may have  difficulty  working  with
national Government on economic development, we  have  no  such  difficulty.
That is  because  we  take  the  lead,  rather  than  waiting  for  national
Government. [Applause.] Similarly, we have never taken the view  that  Nepad
is everything to everybody and that it alone will solve  all  our  problems.
We take a view that says Nepad is but the instrument, important  as  it  is,
for the broader African Renaissance.

I think part of the difficulty has been that people  refuse  to  locate  the
importance of Nepad within the  broader  framework  of  the  African  Union,
which is led by our President. I think we  must  be  able  to  identify  the
issues for Nepad, but Nepad has to be located within the broader context  of
the African Renaissance and the African Union if it is  going  to  make  any
sense for the people of our country. If we  treat  Nepad  as  a  stand-alone
programme, we are more likely  to  lose  focus  on  the  broader  challenges
facing our continent.

In less than two years' time it will be the  end  of  the  current  term  of
Government and the end of the first decade of freedom and democracy  in  our
country. As we move closer  to  that  time,  we  must  answer  the  critical
question which the President posed, and that is whether  we  are  succeeding
in our efforts to build a democratic, united nation and uplift  the  quality
of all our people.

We have outlined, in the mid-term report that  I  was  speaking  about,  the
things we have done. What I am indicating is  that  we  can  really  succeed
working with national Government and local government, without  waiting  for
them. We took a decision as a  province  that  we  are  going  to  launch  a
programme called Zivuseni, a programme focused at how we can improve  social
infrastructure. That programme is succeeding and will succeed even  further.
Of course, we need more assistance and  more  partnerships  from  local  and
national governments, but we have no difficulty in implementing it.  Indeed,
our people are beginning to benefit from those particular programmes.

I want to just indicate to the President that, based on that  programme,  to
date 114 projects have been initiated throughout  our  province,  comprising
53 schools, 31 clinics, 13 hospitals, 10 waste buy-back centres,  six  once-
off clean air projects and one furniture restoration project. But  again  we
have taken another different step in that in our province we  are  going  to
ensure that most of our infrastructure work  is  labour-intensive.  We  have
thus introduced a 60% quota requirement on all our projects, because of  our
commitment to unemployment and poverty alleviation.

Hence, we cannot go to the President and complain about what he is doing  at
national level. We are more likely to come to the President  and  say,  ``We
have taken these routes and we want your support.'' We have never found  his
Government to be unwilling to support such initiatives.  Sometimes  I  think
...

... uStof uza kuyazi le nto - kufanele sisinqande ingenzeki le nto  ithethwa
eBhayibhileni ithi abantu banikezwa italente waza omnye  wayibeka  nje  apha
phantsi, kwaza kwathi xa zifunwa waphendula wathi ``Thixo  bendikwazi  ukuba
unjani. Bendisazi ukuba uza kubuya uyifune  le  talente.  Yiyo  loo  nto  ke
ndiyibeke apha phantsi ukuze uthi  xa  uyifuna  ndikunike.  (Translation  of
Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[... Rev Stofile will know this - we must stop ourselves and not do what  is
said in the Bible, where it is said that people were given talents.  One  of
them just hid it in a hole in the ground. Then, when the talents were  asked
for, he responded by saying, ``Master, I knew  that  you  are  a  hard  man,
haRvesting where you  have  not  sown  and  gathering  where  you  have  not
scattered seed. So I was afraid, and went out and hid your  talents  in  the
ground. See, here is what belongs to you''.]

We cannot do that. We must go  out  and  say,  ``Nazi  iitalente  siziphiwe.
Sizalisa kanjani na ... [Here are talents given to us. How are we  going  to
use them profitably ... ] ... on those particular issues?'' And that is  our
approach as a province. [Applause.]

Let me also tell the President that on the  question  of  understanding  the
important role that Nepad is playing, we are also not waiting for him. As  I
speak MEC Moleketi is in Nigeria to explore  economic  co-operation  between
our province and our Nigerian counterparts. He  is  accompanied  by  Gauteng
Economic  Development  Agency  head,  Charles  Jonker,  and   a   group   of
businesspeople from the ITC, property development  and  tourism  sectors.  I
have no doubt that if we were to wait for  the  President,  because  of  his
heavy schedule we would never be  able  to  take  those  businesspeople  out
there to explore.

Let me also say something about the important role of  the  NCOP.  I  really
want to raise this issue, particularly with regard to the mandate  given  to
the hon Van Schalkwyk, having  been  elected  rotating  Chairperson  of  the
NCOP. Our view as a province is that one of the challenges facing  the  NCOP
is how  to  better  co-ordinate  the  work  between  the  three  spheres  of
Government and the legislatures. We need to find new ways that  will  enable
provinces  to  influence  programming  and  to  link  provincial  whips   to
provincial programmes. I heard  the  Chief  Whip  speaking  about  how  they
promote provincial week and really go out of their way to focus on  that.  I
agree with that.

But we find it very difficult as a province to work, because we do not  want
to have our NCOP delegates arriving at the province and  saying,  ``This  is
our programme.'' They are not independent from the  provincial  legislature.
We want them to say, ``We are back, what is the  programme?  We  would  then
say to them, ``This is our focus week and these are  our  problems,  ngenani
entsimini.'' We would then work out the solutions with them. We  think  this
is something which the NCOP really needs to work out  with  us,  because  in
that way we are more likely to further strengthen co-operation than to  have
the province and the NCOP working in two different directions.

We want to tell the President that  we  remain  committed  to  dealing  with
issues of job creation. We are aware that some of the key projects  that  we
are engaging in are really long-term projects. Hence, when  I  was  speaking
about the work we do around labour intensity, I intimated  that  since  1999
we have been able to create, on average, 20Â 000 jobs per annum  through  our
infrastructure-development programme. This year  the  number  has  increased
dramatically, since we have introduced the rule that I was  speaking  about.
Again, in that way we have been able to say that we will not  wait,  we  are
going to look at how we can move forward.

I conclude by  saying  the  following.  The  fact  that  we  indicate  these
initiatives and these successes does not in any way mean that there  are  no
challenges in our province. The challenges remain immense. We know that  for
many of our  people  life  continues  to  remain  a  struggle  in  terms  of
unemployment, poverty and so forth. But we also know that  they  have  trust
in the leadership they have put in place; that this leadership is  committed
to dealing with  issues  of  poverty  and  unemployment;  and  that  working
together with them, we can continue to push back the frontiers  of  poverty.
[Applause.]

Mr  N  M  RAJU:  Chairperson,  hon  President,  hon  premiers,  hon  special
delegates and hon  collegues,  I  commence  my  speech  with  the  words  of
Rabindranath Togore, one  of  India's  and  the  world's  finest  poets  and
philosophers:


  Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
  Where knowledge is free
  Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
  By narrow domestic walls
  Where words come out from the depth of truth
  Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
  Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
  Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
  Where the mind is led forward by thee
  Into ever-widening thought and action
  Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

I recall how elated I felt, as a young student at high  school,  when  Ghana
became the first country in Africa  to  get  its  independence,  when  Kwame
Nkrumah broke the shackles  of  British  colonialist  power.  Not  even  the
independence of India a decade earlier had brought me such joy and  elation.
As an African, even as a young boy, I felt a sense of indescribable  joy  at
the birth of Ghana.

Ghana's epochal independence started a series of  African  states  declaring
independence. In accordance with  the  rightful  theory,  Nigeria,  Algeria,
Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and a  host  of  African  states  opted  for
independence. But what has this independence meant to the African people  on
the African continent?

Unfortunately,  political  independence  did  not   equate   with   economic
independence. Africa still remains subservient to its previous  masters.  It
remains  the  reservoir  of  raw  materials  and  mineral  resources  to  be
exploited by the former overlords.

The race that Kwame Nkrumah had begun is far from  over.  In  a  sense,  the
baton is now in your hands.  Economic  self-sufficiency  in  Africa  beckons
over the horizon and the President has identified the  means  to  arrive  at
the destination, the means to get Africa off its knees and to get Africa  to
stand tall, and that means is Nepad.

Someone  described  Nepad  as  a  cocktail  of   African   empowerment   and
consciousness, as well as the promotion of business and  prosperity  on  the
African continent. Nepad has attained its own  legitimacy  and  credibility.
The hon the President himself, the South African leader and chairman of  the
non-aligned member states of the African Union, adds to its  stature.  South
Africa has recently been on a crusade to  restore  peace  and  democracy  in
Burundi and the DRC, and this scores favourably  for  South  Africa's  moral
integrity and reputation.

The African Union and Nepad may be the modern  version  of  Africa's  social
contract. It is plausible that Africa's contract commits  it  to  principles
of democracy, the rule of law and strong respect for human rights. But  many
times its leaders have made pledges they  failed  to  uphold.  Kenyan  Peter
Anyanginyongo, a professor of  political  science,  captures  it  eloquently
when he states:


  Quite often those who are involved in practical politics fail to see  the
  future. They fail to make the future  according  to  what  they  perceive
  ought to be done. Perhaps that is why history is so full of skeletons  of
  major mistakes, made by political leaders or would-be makers of history.

This is where Africa's peer review mechanism  becomes  essential.  The  peer
review mechanism has become the centre of controversy over whether  it  will
include issues of political governance or be restricted to economic and  co-
operative governance matters.

The hon the President contends that the decision to make the AU  responsible
rather than Nepad was that under the Constitutive Act of  the  Union  member
states that fail to comply with the decisions of the AU may  be  subject  to
sanctions. It would be  fundamentally  wrong  to  submit  obligations  to  a
voluntary peer review system. The hon the  President's  contention  was,  of
course, intended to hit the critics of the peer review mechanism for a six.

On the foreign affairs front, it is the considered opinion of my party  that
South Africa should wait for the lifting of international sanctions  against
Iraq and its acceptance into the international family of nations  before  we
enter into constructive diplomatic dialogue  with  that  country.  My  party
requests that the hon the President decline the  invitation  to  Iraq  as  a
guest of President Saddam Hussein. [Interjections.]

South Africa must persuade Iraq  to  comply  with  the  UN  resolutions  and
provide unhindered access to nuclear  weapons  inspectors.  The  revised  US
resolution demanded unfettered access to sites suspected of  being  used  to
develop weapons of mass destruction, ie biological and/or  nuclear  weapons.
The inevitable consequence of defiance by  Iraq  to  accede  to  inspections
would, of course, be war, which should be averted at all costs.

Steven  Morrison,  a  former  state  department  official  in  the   Clinton
administration and director of  the  Africa  Programme  at  the  Centre  for
Strategic and Internal Studies in Washington DC,  said  South  Africa  could
pay a high diplomatic price for what he described as a treacherous  path  of
engagement  with  Iraq.  Morrison  said  South  Africa  risks   losing   its
diplomatic credibility, as well as the benefits  of  its  relationship  with
the US. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Who wrote that speech? [Laughter.]

Mr N M RAJU: My party concurs with Steven Morrison.

If I may retort, we write our own speeches: we do not get them  from  above.
[Laughter.]

The DP concurs with Steven Morrison and fears that any  open  fraternisation
with Saddam Hussein  at  this  juncture  would  sound  the  death  knell  of
relations with the US administration. [Interjections.]

In conclusion, we applaud the President's recent call  for  the  containment
of corruption and fraud among public  servants.  Nothing  can  be  more  ...
[Time expired.] [Interjections.]

Cllr N DUBE (Salga): Chairperson, Mr President, hon members of the NCOP  and
hon premiers present here today, let me start by apologising  on  behalf  of
the Chairperson  of  Salga,  who  could  not  be  here  because  of  another
commitment in Johannesburg at our NGC.

Our NGC takes place at a point where, two years in the new system  of  local
government, we now at least have some basis on which  to  critically  assess
the successes, failures and challenges that  have  beset  local  government.
Therefore we would like to use these lessons to pave  the  way  forward,  to
benefit our communities.

Our NGC takes place at a time of policy review and reflection,  whereby  key
initiatives such as amendments to section 39 of  the  Constitution  and  the
devolution of powers and functions from  other  spheres  of  government  are
increasingly put on the spotlight. It also comes at a  time  when  organised
local government is undergoing radical transformation and restructuring,  in
order for it to be able to rise to the challenges posed by the  enormity  of
its mandate.

We are here today and have come as leaders  from  communities  with  similar
interests. But together as a collective we believe that we  have  come  here
today to dovetail our actions  within  the  broader  framework  of  national
priorities; priorities that emphasise the improvement in the quality of  the
lives for all our people. An agenda has  been  set  to  clearly  demonstrate
that our people come first, as  a  test  of  our  Government's  approach  on
dealing with these issues on a daily basis.

Last year  the  Presidential  Co-ordinating  Committee,  championed  by  our
President, identified a number of key objectives aimed at strengthening  the
local government sector, namely building a strong  local  government  sphere
and enhancing its status within a stable co-operative government  framework.
The important question  is,  how  far  have  we  gone,  not  just  as  local
government, but also as other spheres of government  and  social  actors  in
achieving these objectives?

As we are having our NGC, these are some of the issues that we  are  dealing
with in order to be able to pave a way forward.  A  number  of  achievements
have been cited by a number of speakers here today,  some  of  them,  within
the local government  sphere,  being  a  smooth  transition  free  of  major
service disruptions.

Millions of our  people  in  households  now  have  access  to  basic  water
services. Millions of our people have houses  or  some  of  the  houses  are
still are under construction. We can honestly say that our leaders  and  our
people have rolled up their sleeves.

In terms of local economic development, it is  commonly  accepted  that  the
transition process outcome was  fundamentally  transformed  to  ensure  that
local government is not just a  service-orientated  administration,  but  is
also developmentally focused and positioned to grow the  local  economy.  We
therefore see ourselves as agents for economic development, and  that  is  a
move beyond the limited paradigm of local  economic  development  that  does
not result in large-scale sustainable employment as part of  our  effort  to
create employment for the mass of our people.

The  implication  of  the  above  is  that  municipalities  are  positioning
themselves in relation to other spheres of  government  and  therefore  need
increased support and co-operation from, as well as co-ordination with,  the
national  and  provincial  spheres  of  government  in  order  to   have   a
sustainable growth of the local and regional economies.

It is therefore vital that the key question for all  municipalities  in  our
country be,  ``How  best  do  we  grow  and  increase  our  areas  of  gross
geographic products?'' The  answer  to  this  question  has  been  found  in
debates of a developmental nature.

There has been some debate  on  whether  we  should  be  focusing  on  local
economic development or growth-led  economic  development  strategies.  Does
the growing importance of our cities regarding  the  national  GDP  and  the
impact of urban growth on the rural hinterland  suggest  a  shift  from  the
rural to the urban areas, or are these some of the issues that we  have  not
been grappling with?

The growing concentration of  economic  activity  in  the  urban  areas  has
resulted in an increasing concentration of the world's population in  cities
and towns,  as  people  migrate  from  rural  areas  looking  for  jobs  and
opportunities. It is said that half of our population  now  lives  in  urban
areas. At the same time we are witnessing a growing  urbanisation  that  has
not only depleted the rural skills base, but  has  also  led  to  increasing
differentials between the rich and the poor, resulting in growing levels  of
urban poverty and joblessness.

We want to say here that we are  in  the  process  of  developing  effective
strategies to deal with urbanisation within  our  country's  context  of  an
increasingly blurred distinction between urban and  rural  economies  and  a
population that has thrown into sharp focus the importance of  understanding
the exact nature  of  urban-rural  linkages  within  a  holistic  system  of
economic production.

In the IDPs the necessity for all spheres  of  local  government  to  ensure
that there is consensus aimed at adding value to service  delivery  is  more
crucial than ever before. We need to integrate all our plans into one so  as
to  maximise  our  delivery,  using  the  IDPs  as  key  strategic  planning
instruments for the Government.

We have noted the comments made regarding the  lessons  that  the  President
mentioned. As a result of that, we  are  suggesting  that  there  be  three-
sphere   IDP   forums   which   strive   to   involve   everybody   in   the
conceptualisation  processes  and   joint   implementation   of   integrated
development plans, thereby avoiding  the  current  disjuncture  in  priority
planning and implementation.

We need to establish vertical and horizontal links, in order  to  strengthen
the collective institutions of Government and the holistic  concept  of  co-
operative governance. The  key  to  success  of  any  intergovernmental  co-
operation, we believe, depends on the dynamic flow of information,  as  well
as the merging and focusing of this  information  to  value-added  decision-
making which will enhance delivery at the end of the day. We note  here  the
participation  and  co-operation  of  some  of  the  provinces,  which  have
assisted  local  government  in  terms  of  participating  in  the  delivery
process.

On our participation in intergovernmental relations, Salga  has  established
a commission which is looking at various options  of  our  participation  on
intergovernmental forums, particularly in the NCOP. The question is, how  do
we ensure that we as elected councillors at  the  local  level  balance  our
participation in these forums?

We are seriously scrutinising our effectiveness and participation  in  these
structures. The questions that we are asking is, are we  really  making  any
impact? Are we being taken seriously in these structures? If not,  why  not?
Are we as  Salga  representatives  consistent?  Are  we  well  prepared  and
capacitated to fulfil some of these challenges?

I would like to see ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, President, yesterday Ronald Noble,  the  secretary-
general of Interpol in Paris, gave a chilling warning, and I quote:


  Something worrying is going on. All intelligence experts are agreed  that
  al-Qaeda is preparing a major terrorist operation. The  field  of  battle
  now stretches to all countries and mobilises several terrorist groups.

This was a confirmed by intelligence experts around the world. Suddenly  the
world is becoming menacing and dangerous. These trends  affect  us  vitally.
Since September 11, we have over the past year - and in  the  past  week  in
particular - seen a political shift of  major  proportions  that  influences
the economy of our country directly, including our provinces. It  will  also
shape all our relationships  and  our  actions.  I  refer  to  the  mid-term
elections in the US in relation to events I started off talking about.

The President will have to deal with this reality in his time. I  appreciate
the fact that the President travels so much, accepts so much  responsibility
and is so ambitious for his country and continent. We  share  this  ambition
with the President. The man in charge of the presidency in the US, Mr  Bush,
has a majority in the Senate and Congress.  A  man  who  was  an  accidental
president has suddenly  become  a  monumental  president  in  the  mould  of
Eisenhower and Roosevelt, the only people to  have  enjoyed  this  level  of
support in the history of that country.
President Bush will be in office for the next six years. His term of  office
will run parallel to that of our President,  ie  their  terms  will  run  in
tandem. If he fails, we all lose; if he succeeds, we all win. We  only  need
to look at the United Nations resolution passed on Iraq  last  week  to  see
his stamp of authority. As the American Enterprise Institute said  recently,
and I quote:


  Anyone who fools themselves into thinking that the road has  a  different
  ending than the road that leads to a regime  change  in  Iraq,  is  sadly
  mistaken.

I am not arguing the merits, I am just arguing the  facts.  Bush  knows  the
reality that without globalisation, there can be little human  progress  and
without global peace and order, there can be  no  globalisation.  These  two
issues are inextricably linked and we are part of  it.  It  includes  Nepad,
their capacity to help and the capacity of the world not to be  crowded  out
by these matters of security.

America is here to stay and our ability to grasp this  fact  will  determine
our progress. We have to avoid giving mixed signals and come out clearly  on
the side of the angels. Fortunately, the President met Mr Bush while he  was
still Governor of Texas and made an investment in the relationship. We  wish
to thank the President for this as it was far-sighted to have done that.

Fortunately, our constitutional values are in accord with those of  Mr  Bush
and the world consensus. Let us stand squarely behind the  great,  unfolding
struggle for peace, order and prosperity.  In  our  country,  let  us  stand
united against terror. In the world  let  us  stand  united  in  pursuit  of
peace.

I am not sure whether the President has read Mr Bush's biography. If he  has
not I can lend it to him. [Laughter.] I have just finished  reading  it.  It
is something we should read to have insight into the man. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  Durr,  I  am  afraid  your
time has expired.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Chairperson,  hon
President, premiers, hon members the Salga delegation, I wish to  thank  you
for giving me the opportunity to participate in this debate.

Let me first and foremost extend an apology on behalf of  our  premier,  who
is in London on an official visit. I also  wish  to  extend  an  apology  on
behalf of the MEC in the Office of the Premier, who was supposed to be  here
but is engaged with  other  official  duties.  They  have  requested  me  to
represent the province in this debate.

I also wish to congratulate the hon Mr Van  Schalkwyk  on  his  election  as
rotating Chairperson, as well as the hon  Mr  Mushwana,  who  has  now  been
appointed to the position of Public Protector by the President.

This debate in the NCOP brings us close to the end of  a  highly  productive
year in which we as public representatives in various spheres of  Government
have endeavoured to serve the people of our country.

At the outset, I wish to associate the government of the  Northern  Province
with the congratulations and gratitude expressed to the members of the  NCOP
by the hon the President and other speakers in this debate.  This  body  has
indeed become an indispensable element of our democratic system and a  vital
link between national Government and the respective provinces.

We very recently reached an important milestone in the  development  of  our
country when we celebrated the first 100  months  of  our  democratic  South
Africa, which is governed under a system where the will  of  the  people  is
paramount.  By  now  the  dark  days  of  repression,  minority   rule   and
institutionalised racism have turned into a fading memory.

Unfortunately, there are still fringe elements within our  society  who  are
under  the  mistaken  impression  that  they  can  resurrect  a  failed  and
discredited system of apartheid and take us back to the  darkest  period  of
our country's history. We as  public  representatives  want  to  tell  these
deluded individuals that they will never be able to  shake  the  foundations
of our democracy or democratic system, nor will they  cause  the  Government
to stray from this chosen direction towards peace and progress for  all  the
people of our country.

It is not only the Government of  the  day  using  the  instruments  at  its
disposal in the criminal justice system who will hunt these scoundrels  down
and punish them to the fullest extent of the law, but also  an  overwhelming
majority of our population, both black and white, both urban and rural,  who
will not be led astray by false ideologies or pie-in-the-sky promises.

The facts speak for themselves and the reality of South Africa  is  that  we
live in a vastly better country than we did eight years ago, under the  very
capable and progressive leadership of our President,  his  Cabinet  and  our
ruling party. In the international sphere, we are among the leading  nations
of the world and we are welcomed with open  arms  at  various  multinational
forums. In the UN, the AU, the Commonwealth and  the  Non-aligned  Movement,
the leadership role of  South  Africa  is  widely  acknowledged  and  highly
praised.

As one of the driving forces behind Nepad,  we  will  work  in  co-operation
with our fellow countries on the continent  to  make  this  century  one  of
lasting progress and prosperity for the children of  our  soil.  But  it  is
within our country that we have seen a  most  remarkable  turnaround.  Where
once there was despair, there is now hope. Where once our  people  lived  as
enemies and adversaries, there are encouraging signs of the growth of a  new
South Africanism. This new  spirit  of  unity  will  never  be  derailed  by
lunatics and racists.

At the beginning  of  the  year,  our  President  announced,  amongst  other
things, two visionary initiatives to be the central themes of  our  national
efforts in the year 2002. The one was the Letsema Campaign, with its  strong
emphasis on community participation and voluntary service on behalf  of  the
broader community. This is not an initiative that will stop at  the  end  of
this year. It  should  rather  become  an  integral  part  of  our  national
identity,  where  each  and  every  one  of  us  will   continue   to   seek
opportunities to work towards the greater good of  society.  As  leaders  of
our country, we must continue to  foster  the  spirit  of  volunteerism  and
community service.

The other major theme of 2002 was again emphasised  by  the  President  here
today, and that is our all-out battle against poverty and  want.  It  is  an
undisputed fact that most of the  serious  developmental  challenges  facing
our country, such as rural  development,  the  battle  against  disease  and
illness, the  battle  against  illiteracy  and  the  battle  against  gender
empowerment can eventually be tracked back to the root problem of poverty.

In Limpopo we have taken  determined  steps  to  address  the  challenge  of
poverty. We are of the  firm  opinion  that  the  success  of  our  national
efforts will be measured by the progress we are making in  reducing  poverty
in rural areas. As a provincial government, we are taking  this  issue  very
seriously, and the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty has  become
a primary focus area  of  our  vision  to  make  Limpopo  viable  and  self-
sufficient by the year 2020.

Members of this House maybe know that Limpopo is one of the provinces  which
have taken over a number of former homeland governments. It has  taken  over
the former Lebowa, Gazankulu and Venda, as well as  parts  of  the  northern
Transvaal which were white areas in the olden days. This area is faced  with
great poverty like all the other  provinces  in  the  country,  but  we  are
endeavouring to do our  best  as  a  province  to  get  people  involved  in
fighting poverty and doing things for themselves.

To enable us to get a comprehensive picture of the challenges facing us,  we
have initiated thorough research to look at the profile of  poverty  in  the
province and the impact that current alleviation  programmes  have.  Out  of
this, we have managed to have a greater understanding of the extent  of  the
problem, as well as deep conviction that we will make headway in our  effort
to roll back the frontiers of deprivation if we  follow  an  integrated  and
holistic approach.

The days of different spheres of government or a variety  of  agencies  each
trying to make an impact in their own separate ways  are  clearly  over.  We
need a co-ordinated and consistent approach  that  can  bring  together  the
skills and resources of each agency in a clear and coherent manner.

To achieve  this,  the  executive  council  of  Limpopo  took  a  number  of
important decisions during the course of the past few months. These  include
the creation of an executive council committee on  poverty  alleviation  and
an establishment of a  provincial  task  team  to  ensure  that  the  issues
continue to receive attention at  the  highest  level.  At  the  operational
level,  we  are  establishing  a  poverty  programme  management   committee
composed of departmental heads, as  well  as  poverty  programme  management
units with a dedicated staff component and  clear  and  tangible  goals  and
targets.

We are of the firm opinion  that  district  and  local  governments  can  be
primary vehicles for the implementation of poverty  alleviation  programmes.
For this reason we are working very closely with  municipalities  to  ensure
that local economic development programmes are drafted and  implemented.  We
have also made considerable progress with  the  implementation  of  national
strategies such as the Integrated Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme
and the Community-based Public Works Programme.

However, in the  final  analysis  we  believe  that  our  goals  of  poverty
reduction and  eradication  will  only  be  reached  through  the  concerted
efforts of the broader community. To achieve this, we are working  to  build
a creative partnership with the private sector,  faith-based  organisations,
traditional leadership and community structures to  form  one  united  front
against poverty and deprivation.

As a province we have identified  the  areas  of  tourism,  agriculture  and
mining as major  focus  areas  of  our  provincial  growth  and  development
strategy. As we speak, the Premier of Limpopo, Adv Ngoaka Ramatlhodi, is  in
London to attend an international exhibition where  our  province  is  being
marketed extensively. Next week a senior delegation of our province will  be
visiting the Republic of India to look at opportunities for co-operation  in
the fields of agriculture, education  and  information  technology.  We  are
optimistic about the future of our province, our country and our continent.

In the coming days, the eyes of the international community will  be  firmly
focused on Limpopo as one of the most important scientific events in  recent
memory takes place in the Northern  tip  of  our  province.  Scientists  and
astronomers from across the world await the coming solar eclipse with  great
expectations, in the belief  that  it  will  provide  answers  to  searching
questions about the origins of our universe. From a  marketing  and  tourism
perspective this presents us with a greatly unique opportunity  to  showcase
our province, our scenic splendour, our very rich cultural heritage and  our
friendly and generous people to a wide audience.

In conclusion, I trust that the Chairperson, the hon the President  and  all
the hon members of this House will use this  once-in-a-lifetime  opportunity
to visit Limpopo. I know that the President does visit the  province  often,
and I wish to ask other members to join him. [Interjections.]

Limpopo is a loving province. It is a province of peace. Members  should  go
there, and they will find all sorts of things that  one  does  not  find  in
other parts of the world. In the foreseeable future this province will  also
be a province of progress and prosperity. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, hon President, premiers and  colleagues,
as the language ombudsman of the New NP, I urge the  hon  the  President  to
deal harshly with the so-called Afrikaans organisations  and/or  individuals
who use the promotion of the Afrikaans language to promote their own  hidden
agendas, be it violence or seeking  excuses  for  violence,  party-political
positioning or personal  survival.  They  do  not  represent  the  Afrikaans
community, which consists of approximately  3Â million  coloured,  3  million
white and 600Â 000 black Afrikaans speakers.

I also urge the hon the President not to  remove  multilingualism  from  the
priority  list  of  Government.  Multilingualism  cannot  compete  with  the
eradication of poverty, the fighting of crime or the combating of  HIV/Aids.
But multilingualism should also be at the core or the heart of each  of  the
above-mentioned Government priorities. To use the hon  the  President's  own
language, it is not a luxury. It is a necessity for empowerment.

Government cannot succeed in eradicating poverty for as long as  people  are
informed about projects, apply for project finance  or  for  jobs  in  their
second or third language. Government cannot succeed  in  fighting  crime  by
addressing this issue in  people's  second  or  third  language.  Government
cannot succeed in  explaining  safe  sex  and  the  devastating  effects  of
HIV/Aids in a person's second or third language. Nepad will not  succeed  if
the language diversity in Africa is ignored. Ninety percent or more  members
in this Parliament use English as their second or third  language,  and  yet
we have to deliberate in committees on  behalf  of  South  Africans  in  our
second or third language.

It  is  true  that  the  direct  price  of  professional  interpreting   and
translation services is high. But we must calculate the price  South  Africa
is paying for monolingualism. We must calculate the indirect  costs.  It  is
general knowledge that there is a direct link  between,  on  the  one  hand,
mother-tongue education in the first  four  to  seven  years  of  a  child's
school career, and on the other, matric and tertiary results.

What is the price we are paying for the far too low pass rate at matric  and
university level? The way  multilingualism  is  dealt  with  in  the  higher
education policy is, at the moment, an obstacle and needs to  be  revisited.
To ignore Afrikaans and indigenous languages of South  Africa  in  practice,
is too expensive to tolerate any longer.

We are anxiously awaiting the national language framework to bring  language
security in South Africa. In the meantime, the New  NP  is  tabling  private
members'  legislative  proposals  in  all  the  provinces  to  bring   about
multilingualism, and I hope that the premiers present will help to speed  up
this process.

We have to stop people from  window  dressing  and  get  them  committed  to
multilingualism.  It  starts  with  the  executive,  the  legislatures,  the
municipalities and Parliament. We need to  set  the  example,  and  in  this
House our Chairperson does it. The hon Shilowa did it when he got  fired  up
in his speech just now! [Laughter.]

Afrikaans is the language which I inherited from my forefathers and, to  me,
is the the most beautiful language in the world. I am sure that the hon  the
President feels exactly the same  about  isiXhosa,  and  the  other  members
about their own Tshivenda, isiZulu, Xitsonga, Setswana or whatever. This  is
because if I am not proud of what is mine, of what I have inherited,  nobody
can trust me or respect me for what I am, and I cannot expect them to  allow
me to promote what is theirs.

Today I am addressing the hon the President in my second  language,  out  of
respect for him. If the hon the President was impressed  with  what  I  said
and the way I said it, can he imagine what it would  have  been  like  if  I
said it in Afrikaans? [Laughter.] May I say to the hon  the  President:  Let
us  build  a  really  prosperous  nation   by,   together,   promoting   and
acknowledging  all  our  languages.  ke  xarra  ke.  [Unity  in   diversity]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  I  have  been
informed that Mr Bhengu will not participate, so I will call  upon  the  hon
Mrs Lubidla.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA:  Chairperson,  hon  President  of  the  Republic  of  South
Africa, premiers, speakers and hon members, it  is  a  rare  honour  for  me
personally to address a distinguished  audience  of  South  African  leaders
such as yourselves.

The  presence  of  President  Mbeki  here  today  is  a  reflection  of  the
commitment of the President himself and of the Government to  the  principle
of co-operative governance. It is an indication of the importance which  the
President attaches to the positive role that is being played by the NCOP  in
this process of co-operative governance. The constitutional  recognition  of
local government as a sphere of government has  significantly  enhanced  its
status and given it a new, dynamic role in the service delivery process.

In particular,  local  government  has  been  assigned  a  leading  role  in
relation  to  poverty  alleviation,  local  economic  development  and   the
empowerment of communities.  To  successfully  lead  this  campaign  against
poverty,  local  government  will  have  to  equip  itself   by   developing
innovatives responses to  the  challenges  posed  by  poverty  and  economic
underdevelopment.

One of the ways in which local  government  will  be  able  to  successfully
confront the challenges  of  poverty  and  underdevelopment  is  through  an
integrated development planning approach. Central to this  approach  is  the
development   of   integrated   development   plans,   ie   the   IDPs,   by
municipalities. Integrated development plans  are  essential  tools  through
which the duplication and waste of  valuable  resources  that  characterised
apartheid planning can be limited. It  enables  municipalities  together  to
pool scarce local resources to address the most  important  needs  of  local
communities.

IDPs also help to speed  up  delivery.  They  enable  local  governments  to
identify the least serviced and most impoverished areas, and point at  where
municipal funds should be spent. Most importantly,  IDPs  provide  a  unique
opportunity for government at all three spheres,  communities  and  business
to work together and agree on mechanisms and resources required to meet  the
needs of local communities in a sustainable way.

The existence of sound financial, institutional and  administrative  systems
at local  government  level  is  a  precondition  for  effective  integrated
development   planning.   The   clumsy   and    unco-ordinated    financial,
institutional and administrative support systems for local government  which
we inherited from apartheid have been one of the  main  problems  inhibiting
the effective functioning of new  municipalities.  This,  in  turn,  impacts
negatively on the ability of municipalities to develop their IDPs.

The development of effective IDPs is of genuine concern to the NCOP  because
we believe that, without it, swift development  at  local  government  level
may be severely retarded and effective service  delivery  compromised.  That
is why the NCOP decided, as part of its  provincial  visits,  to  address  a
specific set of questions to city and  district  councils.  The  purpose  of
these questions was to ascertain the progress that had been  made  in  terms
of the development, adoption and implementation of the IDPs.

Firstly, we sought  to  determine  the  kind  of  relationship  that  exists
between city and district councils to develop IDPs.  Of  particular  concern
to us is the structural human resources and financial  problems  which  this
relationship experiences. Secondly, we also tried  to  determine  what  role
provincial government was playing  in  assisting  with  the  development  of
IDPs, and whether this was adequate.

Thirdly, we tried to determine the level  of  public  participation  in  the
formulation of IDPs, as well as to identify the kind  of  capacity  problems
which councils experience in developing and adopting  their  IDPs.  Finally,
we also tried to establish whether there are any  linkages  and  what  those
linkages are between IDPs and council budgets.

We are currently assembling, comparing  and  systematically  arranging  this
information with a view to debating the issue in this Chamber next year.  It
would be unfair of me not to acknowledge  the  contribution  which  national
Government has made in  making  our  new  model  of  local  government  both
functional and sustainable. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Madam Chair, hon President,  hon  premiers,  comrades  and
colleagues, the co-operation that the ANC  and  the  New  NP  have  is  very
different from the dead alliance. We are in  co-operation  because  we  have
one thing common that we believe in, and that is that the  Western  Cape  is
not a homeland or an island. [Interjections.]

Secondly, the difference is that this is not a marriage made in heaven,  but
a co-operation built on clear objectives. The main  objective  of  this  co-
operation is to build the nation and unite the people of  the  province  and
the entire country.

Mhlalingaphambili, ngaphambili  eli  Phondo  lalibekelwe  abantu  abamhlophe
nabebala kuphela. Mhlawumbi ke ezingqondweni zabo bantu babengazange  bayive
okanye bayifunde indawo ephaya  kuMqulu  weNkululeko  ethi,  ``South  Africa
belongs to all who  live  in  it.''  Kwiingqondo  zabambalwa  ke  zazingekhe
zingene iingcamango ezinjalo.
Ngoku nabantu beli Phondo bayaziva ukuba  nowabo  umlomo  oyi-ANC  uyavakala
apha elulawulweni. Ukuba ungajonga  iindlela  oomasipala  abasebenza  ngazo,
kwithutyana  nje  elifutshane  ungaqaphela  ukuba  ukho  umahluko   phakathi
komasipala  wangaphambili  kunye  nalo  ubukhokelwa   nguMorkel,   kwindlela
ababehlala ngayo abantu. Abantu babehlala ngokwabantu,  hayi  ngokobuhlanga.
Kambe wathi akuba negunya lokuphatha uMorkel wabumisa  ngeenyawo  ubuhlanga.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, this province was  reserved  for  white  and
coloured people only. Perhaps such people had never heard of the  clause  in
the Freedom Charter that goes: "South Africa belongs  to  all  who  live  in
it." Very few could have had such an idea.

Now the people of the province feel that their voice, the ANC, can be  heard
within the government of the province. If you look closely  at  the  history
of local government, you will realise that within  a  short  space  of  time
after Morkel came on the scene, there was a drastic change in the way  local
government was run. People used to live as human beings,  not  according  to
their race. However, when Morkel took over power there was a  resurgence  of
racism.]

The window period brought about something that has  always  been  wanted  by
many South Africans. Councillors from the province have  broken  loose  from
the chains of the dying alliance. It is now in a  very  unstable  condition.
We made it worse when even the last district municipality on the west  coast
realised that in order for the people of this country  to  be  united,  they
must leave le nqwelo ixinge eludakeni, and that  is  very  true.  They  know
that! [Laughter.]

Xa i-DA izika mayizike  nabo  bangqondo  zabo  zingakwaziyo  ukuzicingela  -
ndinqena nje ukubiza amagama abantu apha  eNdlwini  -  abo  bantu  bangqondo
zabo  zicingelwa  ngumntu  onenjongo  enye  ...  (Translation  of   isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[When the DA goes down, it must go down with those people who  cannot  think
for themselves - I'm reluctant to name names in this House  -  those  people
who are led by a person with a one-track mind ... ]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, on a point of order:  This  member  has  been
deliberately misleading the House with information ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! That  is  not  a  point  of  order,  hon
member.

Nksz N  D  NTWANAMBI:  Mhlalingaphambili,  bendisathi  ngabantu  abangakwazi
kuzicingela ngeengqondo zabo,  abacingelwa  ngumntu  omnye  nonenjongo  enye
yokuchasana noRhulumente oku kweyeza likagqirha - kusasa, emini,  ngokuhlwa.
Ayikho enye into ayenzayo,  oko  ingqondo  yakhe  isenza  into  enye  -  oko
kwakuthiwe `Shake  the  bottle  three  times  a  day'.  Mandidlule  kancinci
Mhlalingaphambili,  ndingayibambezeli  le  Ndlu.  (Translation  of  isiXhosa
paragraph follows.)

[Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, I was making  the  point  about  people  who
cannot think for themselves, who are led by a person with a one-track  mind:
opposing Government strictly as if he or she was following  doctor's  orders
- in the morning, at daytime and in the evening. This  person  does  nothing
else, he or she is one-track-minded - it's like he or she is  following  the
order to  "shake  the  bottle  three  times  a  day".  Let  me  go  further,
Chairperson, so as not to delay this House.]

I also want to say to some hon members here that South Africa  and  Zimbabwe
are just neighbours, therefore  we  have  no  right  to  interfere  in  each
other's business. We are two countries, not two provinces. Why should we  be
dictated to by other countries?

If they want to come and invest, they must come and invest. They should  not
say that because we have relations with Zimbabwe and the rand  is  going  up
or down, they cannot enter into agreement with us. It  should  not  be  like
that. May I also say that it is the duty of any responsible leader  in  this
country to protect and articulate the position of the country, not  his  own
or his party's position. We are bound by one Constitution as a country.

Xa ndiza kugqiba [In conclusion], I also want to say that our President  has
a responsibility of making sure that there  is  peace  in  the  world.  Only
irresponsible parties will object to the President's visit to Iraq.  The  DP
or the Democratic Alliance -  whatever  they  call  themselves  -  was  very
silent when these very same countries supported  rebels  on  the  continent.
Instead, they supported them fully.

The kind of opposition we need is one that will be constructive,  with  open
eyes and minds. They should have no fears, and  should  make  sure  that  in
their opposition they assist in building the  country.  Our  future  is  not
dependent on the Americas  or  the  Bushes.  It  is  dependent  on  our  own
President here, and  it  is  our  own  hands  which  will  reconstruct  this
country. [Applause.]

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Chairperson, the hon the Premier of  KwaZulu-
Natal says that our country is affected by a crippling  economic  recession.
It is not.  Indeed,  what  I  said  earlier  about  the  Standard  &  Poor's
upgrading of their assessment of South Africa from stable upwards  indicates
precisely that there is no South Africa that  is  experiencing  a  crippling
economic recession.

I am sure the premier is the only person in the country who has  found  that
recession. [Laughter.] Nobody else has. We are not on  any  slippery  slope.
He said we are on the edge of a slippery, downhill path. We are not at all.

I am saying these things, because I do believe  that  when  we  discuss  the
serious matters that we have been discussing today in this House, we  really
do need to be serious in our approach. It  is  embarrassing  to  talk  about
economic recession when everybody is talking about rates of growth  in  this
country that are above those of the rest of the developed world,  unless  it
is a matter entirely of  a  lack  of  knowledge  of  what  the  terms  mean.
[Laughter.]

Indeed, the reference to being on the edge  of  a  slippery,  downward  hill
referred in part  to  decisions  that  Parliament  has  taken  to  introduce
legislation provided for in the Constitution, which relates  to  the  matter
of the crossing of the floor. The premier seemed to be  very  worried  about
what was going to happen to him as premier of the province. I have  not  the
slightest idea what is going to happen to him, but surely  we  cannot,  each
one of us, say ``what happens to me'' - as an individual  -  ``will  mean  a
slippery downhill path for the country.'' None of us  is  that  important  -
that includes the President. [Applause.] So we do need  to  really  approach
these discussions in a serious manner.

I must say that my own interactions with the provinces - that  includes  the
visits to the provinces - do indeed show that the work of ensuring that  the
provinces do develop is taken extremely seriously by the  premiers  and  the
executives in the provinces. That is my experience.

In the visits we pay to the provinces we go to many of  these  places,  have
lots of discussions, and interact with these processes  in  any  case,  even
outside  of  the  context  of  those  visits.  It  is  important  that  both
provincial governments and the local governments should engage this  matter,
because  indeed  -  as  everybody  has  been  saying  -  the  issue  of  the
eradication of poverty must really be central in terms of what we do.

It cannot be helped that the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal says that  it  is  not
possible for the  province  to  really  engage  its  development  challenges
until, among other things, the province has  greater  autonomy.  This  is  a
federalist position; it is a basic  fundamental  ideological  position  that
the premier was enunciating. One  cannot  say  that  unless  my  ideological
demand is met, I shall do nothing about the  eradication  of  poverty.  That
cannot be correct.

We cannot say to the people that we will not discharge our  responsibilities
until whatever we believe to  be  ideologically  sacred  grounds  have  been
delivered. Fortunately, there is development taking place  in  the  province
of KwaZulu-Natal. It has not waited for autonomy.  [Laughter.]  I  would  be
quite prepared to indicate to the premier what, in  fact,  is  happening  in
the province with regard to development, and also with regard to  all  sorts
of things that are happening that address the matter of the  eradication  of
poverty.

Apart from really treating  our  discussions  here  seriously,  we  also,  I
think, do have an obligation to  communicate  the  correct  message  to  our
people, a message of hope, not cooked up, not  invented,  not  created,  but
actually reflective of what is happening in the country. I do not  think  it
is particularly brilliant leadership to be communicating a  sense  of  gloom
to the people.

If that was true, it would be good  to  convey  the  truth.  But  to  create
something that does not exist, and then communicate  it  to  the  people  in
order to project a future which is terrible and horrible is not, I think,  a
proper exercise of leadership. And I really do  not  think  any  one  of  us
should take pride in that kind of behaviour.

The stance raised by the hon Matthee and others about the  need  for  us  to
work together - I think he said that together South  Africa  can  win  -  is
correct. Fortunately, that is what is happening.

But I do believe that it is necessary for us to  continue  to  look  at  the
question of how the structures and spheres of  government  are  functioning,
so as not to allow any sense of complacency. This  is  because  I  am  quite
certain that a matter I know the Premier of Gauteng has raised before,  that
even with regard to these programmes - such as rural development  and  urban
renewal, that are agreed on - one does get a disjuncture at  certain  points
in terms of the actual commitment of the resources to agreed programmes.

He has raised this  issue  in  the  past.  For  instance,  it  happens  that
national Government, having agreed to whatever the programme might be,  then
does not act on time in  terms  of  making  those  resources  from  national
Government available to  what  it  is  committed  to.  One  then  gets  that
imbalance. So I am saying it is clear that we are improving  the  system  of
co-operation - of co-operative governance - but, surely we should not  allow
for complacency on this matter.

The speaker from eThekwini, Ms Dube, raised the question of  the  need,  for
instance in that context, for  joint  processes  or  common  processes  with
regard to the elaboration of the IDPs. I think that that  was  an  important
observation - the three-sphere IDP fora that she referred to - in  order  to
avoid our pulling in different directions.

Again, as I was saying and bearing in mind the remarks  that  were  made  by
Premier Shilowa about how we might organise visits of the NCOP, I  am  quite
certain that the work of the NCOP  to  assist  in  stitching  together  that
relationship among the three spheres of government is an important  part  of
what we have to do. It is also an important part of the larger  matter  that
the hon Matthee was referring to of our working together as a country.

It is true that there will be some dinosaurs in our  society  that  will  be
hangovers from the past, but, fortunately, in the nature of  dinosaurs  they
sort of die away and disappear. This includes the people,  and  others,  who
have  been  setting  off  the  bombs.  Most  certainly  the  law-enforcement
authorities will act very firmly with regard to all of these matters. It  is
our obligation to make sure that we protect lives and  property;  that  must
happen.

Indeed, I was glad to hear the hon members speak out  against  those  people
who seek to make justifications for these acts of terror.  It  is  obviously
incorrect and, I think, the more of us who say so, the better. It cannot  be
the case that there is any demand in the  country  by  anybody  which  gives
them justification to take up arms of  any  sort  and  declare  war  against
South African society.

I am quite sure that even the Group of 63 referred to, will, in  time,  grow
and develop. If they do not, they will go the way of all  dinosaurs.  But  I
would like to hope that  these  are  intelligent  people,  that  they  would
indeed, as I was saying, grow and develop, and treat the matter of  language
in the manner in which the hon Van Niekerk was indicating. I  agree;  it  is
incorrect to approach the matter of languages in a separate pocket  -  in  a
ghetto. This matter has to be integrated in the manner in  which  a  society
functions. I agree.

All of us need to vigorously pursue this question. We were  discussing  this
in the national Cabinet three, four or five weeks ago, with  regard  to  the
use of languages within the Government. The same point was made as  the  hon
member has just made: that we have to find  a  way  of  integrating  all  of
these  languages  as  much  as  is  possible  within  the  daily  system  of
functioning of the Government. We looked at all manner of things,  including
cost. But, certainly, we are all proceeding from the same position,  because
it is correct. It has to be done.

I would hope that for all of us, wherever we are, that that is the route  we
take. Certainly, from the point of view of the Government,  we  did  approve
what basically would be the use of six different  languages  at  a  specific
time, with some alternations. This was to try to get to the point  at  which
one has a truly inclusive, multilingual system. But there are steps one  has
to take in order to get there. To achieve this objective  does  not  require
bombs; does not require force. These are matters which I am quite sure  that
we can and must resolve  among  ourselves  as  intelligent  South  Africans,
which I am sure we are.

Regarding the challenge of transformation in terms of the matters  that  the
hon Mohseen Moosa was raising, yes, they are,  of  course,  important.  But,
again, I do believe that with regard even to that whole process -  which  is
not just poverty alleviation but changing of the society - we can come to  a
common determination that is a common national challenge and  that  we  need
to work together  in  order  to  advance  that  particular  process.  It  is
happening.
The hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk raised the matter of  land  tax.  Indeed,  I
agree with him. We need to have a look at that. I was not  aware  personally
that there was a process of this kind,  which  was  impacting  on  land  and
agriculture in the way that  he  indicated.  Certainly,  I  will  take  this
matter up.

As I said, these are matters of transformation. A  fortnight  ago  I  got  a
letter from a big farmer in  the  Northern  Cape  who  complained  that  the
processes of land reform in South Africa were moving  too  slowly.  He  said
whenever they, for  instance,  contacted  officials  at  Land  Affairs,  the
officials took time to respond. They want a programme  to  really  speed  up
this process of dealing with the land question. And  it  is  the  Government
that is delaying the movement forward with regard to this.

As I say, there are people that are engaged in this. This  particular  group
of farmers in the Northern Cape are working with a  group  of  farmers  from
KwaZulu-Natal who are saying  the  same  thing.  They  are  quite  ready  to
engage. We are not talking about somebody else's land, but  their  own  land
in that it has to be part of this process of addressing the  land  question.
I think that is what indicates where South Africa is going -  that  capacity
among South Africans of  acting  together  and  working  together  on  these
commonly identified challenges. I believe that that is the  route  that  all
of us should strive to take.

We will continue to interact with  the  government  of  Iraq.  I  asked  the
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Aziz Pahad, to go to Iraq, and  he  went
last week to meet with President Saddam Hussein and to make the  point  that
it is  critically  important  for  Iraq  to  co-operate  with  the  Security
Council. If  we  say  we  are  committed  to  this  multilateral  system  of
government - the multilateral institutions - then  we  are  all  obliged  to
honour the decisions of the Security Council, as South Africa has done  with
regard to Iraq.

We raised the point with regard to the United States and Iraq  of  it  being
incorrect for the US to seek to act unilaterally  on  the  matter  of  Iraq,
that they needed to act within the context of a  multilateral  organisation,
being the United Nations. I was very pleased that, indeed, that is what  the
US administration then did.

We all have to then pursue the matter of the honouring of  the  decision  of
the Security Council, as I have just indicated,  and  for  that  purpose  we
will continue to be in contact with the government of Iraq.

I do not know the person  referred  to  who  is  supposed  to  be  a  former
official of  the  US  government  during  the  time  of  President  Clinton.
Certainly, he does not reflect the view of the US government,  nor  does  he
reflect the view of the United Nations.

The US government is perfectly conscious of the fact  of  our  contact  with
Iraq, and, indeed, we discussed the matter with them  some  time  ago  about
the need, as I was indicating, to deal with this  matter  via  the  Security
Council; to produce the required result in that these inspectors  should  go
back to Iraq; and, indeed, that we would  discuss  those  matters  with  the
government of Iraq. The  US  government  said  they  would  indeed  be  very
pleased if we could do that, because this might very well assist in  finding
a resolution to this matter. I do not know whom the former official  of  the
state department represents.

South Africa is currently the chair of  the  Non-Aligned  Movement  and  the
chair of the African Union, and we have  certain  obligations  in  terms  of
those organisations. We have taken specific positions with  regard  to  this
and we will communicate those  positions  to  the  government  of  Iraq  and
everybody else.

I heard that the DP, or the DA, believes that we should  not  interact  with
Iraq and threatened that there will be dire  consequences  from  the  United
States. There will not be any dire consequences.

I was very pleased to hear the references made by  the  premiers  and  other
speakers with regard to the African Union  and  Nepad.  We  have  to  pursue
these two matters to the best of our  ability.  The  matters  of  democracy,
peace and prosperity on the African continent  are  matters  that  are  very
vital, and are vital to the future of  our  country  as  well.  We  have  to
pursue these matters, and I am quite convinced that overwhelming opinion  on
the continent - I am not just talking  about  leaders,  but  about  ordinary
people too - is in favour of these processes.

There has been a lot of confusion about what is described  as  peer  review.
Part of it is informed, unfortunately, by people not wanting  to  ask  about
this process. If only they said: ``I  do  not  understand.  Can  you  please
explain''. They do not want to ask, because they know - and so they come  to
conclusions which are quite wrong.

We will do what needs to be done. The matter,  as  I  keep  saying,  of  the
issues that relate to political governance are  provided  for  in  terms  of
legislation that  was  passed  by  our  national  Parliament.  Our  national
Parliament passed the Constitutive Act of the African Union. So this is  the
law. This is what we mean  by  good  political  governance.  These  are  the
things that we must achieve - we even said there must be a court of  justice
established so that it oversees these things.

Now the people who know say: ``No, no. Do not go that  route.  Make  this  a
voluntary thing''. Why do they want to make it a voluntary  thing?  That  is
wrong. There is  a  law  in  place  approved  by  the  majority  of  African
parliaments, which came into force and which  is  why  it  was  possible  to
establish the African Union. It was established by treaty. It  is  necessary
that those provisions of the Constitutive Act, which are in  that  law,  are
observed.

So I say to Premier Mtshali that that is the truth about that; not  what  he
might have read in some newspaper.

The continent will proceed in that manner. Indeed, I  know  that  people  in
Parliament are looking at a number of these things - as to  the  steps  that
need to be taken to make sure that we have all these institutions  in  place
on the African continent so that they discharge their responsibilities.

I would most certainly be interested in  the  biography  of  President  Bush
that the hon Kent Durr has. I will certainly read it. I  am  sure  it  makes
for very interesting reading. [Laughter.]

I say thank you  very  much  indeed  to  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  premiers,
representatives of Salga and members of the Council for this  discussion.  I
think the predominant theme of this discussion is that all of us accept  the
challenges that are ahead of us - the  domestic  challenges  about  poverty,
about the end of underdevelopment and about the challenges that face  us  on
our continent.

I think we are also saying to ourselves  that  we  are  proud  to  be  South
Africans, and not arrogant; that as these proud South Africans  we  are  not
going to do or say anything that is going to  run  our  country  down,  that
without foundation is going to  project  negative  images  of  our  country,
which do not exist and are based on nothing;  that  we  are  not  afraid  of
discharging our responsibilities if we believe them to  be  correct,  simply
because there is somebody else in the world who is  more  powerful  than  us
and that therefore we must be intimidated. I think we are saying that  those
who set off bombs in this country will not intimidate us either.

I want to join everybody in congratulating the hon Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk
on his election, also the hon M J Mahlangu, and I am quite  sure  that  they
will add great strength, value and wisdom to the proceedings of this House.

I wish everybody a happy new year. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Thank you, Mr President. I  am  informed
by the Whips that you yourself may be the  subject  of  several  nominations
very soon, and the Whips have directed me to wish you good fortune  in  that
regard.

We thank the President for having been present in the  House  to  lead  this
debate.

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 18:02.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Joint Budget Committee on the Medium Term Budget  Policy
     Statement, dated 11 November 2002:


     The Joint Budget Committee reports as follows:


     1.     TERMS OF REFERENCE AND HEARINGS


     The Minister of Finance  tabled  the  2002  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
     Statement (MTBPS) before Parliament on Tuesday  29  October  2002.  The
     2002 MTBPS  sets  out  the  macroeconomic  context  and  fiscal  policy
     considerations against  which  the  2003  Budget  will  be  framed.  It
     outlines developments in tax policy and the  main  spending  priorities
     for the next three-year  (2003/4  to  2005/6)  Medium-Term  Expenditure
     Framework (MTEF) period, including allocations to provincial and  local
     government levels.


     On 28 October 2002, the official  terms  of  reference  for  the  Joint
     Budget Committee were tabled. The very brief period  between  then  and
     the close of the Parliamentary session put great time pressure both  on
     the Committee and on those giving evidence to  it,  which  limited  its
     ability to carry out its mandate. The terms of  reference  mandate  the
     Committee to:


     *  Consider  proposed  allocations  in  the   Medium-Term   Expenditure
         Framework (MTEF) and  the  Appropriation  Bill  and  whether  these
         allocations are broadly in keeping with the  policy  directions  of
         Government;


     * Make proposals regarding the processes Parliament should follow  with
         regard to its role in the developing of budgets in accordance  with
         constitutional requirements;
     * Consider, when tabled, the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement,  with
         the exception of those sections  dealing  with  the  macro-economic
         situation and revenue (i.e. Sections 2, 3 and 4);


     * Conduct hearings on the Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  and  the
         Budget  Policy  Review  Document,  with  the  exception  of   those
         sections dealing with the macro-economic situation and revenue;


     * Exercise those powers in Joint Rule 32 that may  assist  in  carrying
         out its functions; and


     * Report on the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement  regarding  the
         matters referred to above.


     This report is accordingly submitted in terms of the above.


     2.     THE MTBPS IN SUMMARY
     2.1    Overview: Sections 1-4


     These sections deal with:


     * The macroeconomic forecasts, global and national, according to  which
         the 2003 Budget will be framed. These are cautiously optimistic.


     * Fiscal policy, trends and goals; revised  estimates  and  the  fiscal
         framework for the 2003 MTEF. Declining debt costs enable  increased
         social spending.


     * Revenue trends and projections, medium term estimates, and tax policy
         for budget 2003. Revenue is estimated to remain at about  24.5%  of
         GDP.


     2.2    MTBPS Section 5: Medium Term Expenditure Framework


     The 2003 MTEF has the following priorities:


     * Poverty reduction and development  by  extending  social  assistance,
         health and education


     * Enhanced investment in municipal infrastructure and basic services


     * Expanded capacity in the safety and security sector, with  particular
         focus on court administration


     * Higher education restructuring


     * Accelerated land reform and restitution


     * Better services to citizens provided by Home Affairs


     * South Africa's growing international role, notably in NEPAD  and  the
         AU


     The preliminary budget framework proposes R84,9 billion  in  additional
     allocations over the 2002  MTEF  baseline  amounts.  Social  and  basic
     service delivery is prioritised, with provinces receiving  the  largest
     adjustments - a further R12,3 billion in 2003/4 rising to R20,8 billion
     in 2005/6. In relative terms, local  government  receives  the  largest
     increase, at 18,4 percent, compared with 9 percent  for  provinces  and
     7,3 percent for national departments.


     2.3 MTBPS Section 6: Provincial and local government finances


     The supplementary allocations to provinces will support the  broadening
     and deepening  of  social  services.  Increased  financial  support  to
     provinces focuses on:


     * Social  grants  will  continue  to  be  adjusted  to  compensate  for
         inflation;


     *  A  progressive  roll-out  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention   and   treatment
         programmes and renewed focus on  sexually  transmitted  infections,
         TB and malaria treatments;


     * Investment in hospital buildings and facilities, schools and clinics;


     * Spending  on  learning  support  materials  in  schools  and  medical
         supplies in health facilities will be stepped up; and


     * Steady increases in investment in the provincial road network will be
         supported.


     Capacity development enabling institutions to disburse allocations with
     increased effectiveness is an important element.  Allocation  to  local
     government  continues  the   emphasis   on   municipal   infrastructure
     investment and the  broadening  of  access  to  free  basic  water  and
     electricity. Government rural development and urban renewal  strategies
     provide a  coordinating  framework  for  creating  jobs  and  extending
     development of communities.


     3.     SOCIAL SERVICES CLUSTER SUBMISSIONS


     MTEF policy priority for  the  cluster:  poverty  reduction  and  human
     capacity building.


     The Joint Budget Committee requested the  social  services  cluster  of
     departments - Education, Social Development, Health, and Provincial and
     Local Government, to give evidence on their progress in  delivering  on
     their policy priority.


     3.1    THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION


     Both the Minister and the Department of Education agreed that the  2002
     Adjustments Estimate and the 2002 MTBPS enable the department  to  give
     effect to educational priorities. In particular: An adjustment of  R2.2
     billion to provincial budgets for 2002/03.


     Government's  strategic  objectives  for  poverty   reduction   through
     education are twofold, namely:


     * To improve adequacy of education funding  for  poor  communities  and
         achieve greater equity in educational outcomes.


     * To implement the wide-ranging  Human  Resource  Development  Strategy
         that is directed towards  improving  the  skills  capacity  of  the
         South African economy.


     3.1.1  Priorities targeted for increased expenditure


     * Learner Support Materials


     * Higher education restructuring


     * The  National  School  Nutrition  Programme  (previously  called  the
         Primary School Nutrition Programme): Cabinet has decided  to  shift
         the function to the  Department  of  Education  in  2004,  and  the
         departments  have  agreed  that  they  will  manage  the  programme
         jointly next year in 2003 and Education in 2004.
     * The school building programme


     * Prevention, care and support  of  people  infected  and  affected  by
         HIV/AIDS, especially via the conditional grant to provinces.


     *  Accelerated  roll-out  of  Early  Childhood  Development  (Grade  R)
         provision.


     * Adult Basic Education and Training (ABET) introduction.


     In conclusion, the Department noted the importance of ensuring that the
     2003  MTEF  allocations  are  realised  in  the  provincial   budgeting
     processes.


     3.2    DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT


     3.2.1  Priorities


     * Poverty reduction, especially targeting the vulnerable: children  and
         those affected and infected by HIV/AIDS.  Reviewing  laws  relating
         to children, expanding  home/community-based  care  programmes  and
         increasing social assistance (foster care). Mitigating  the  impact
         of HIV/AIDS in a national integrated plan  and  developing  policy,
         legislation and capacity building at all levels.


     * Improvement of the social security system. The extension of the Child
         Support Grant to children  between  7-14  is  being  evaluated  for
         fiscal sustainability. Cabinet is considering  the  recommendations
         of the Taylor Commission  and  is  reviewing  the  social  security
         system as a whole.


     * Replacement of the Grant Payment System (SOCPEN) and strengthening of
         the monitoring, evaluation and compliance of grant payments.


     * Tabling the Child Justice Bill  in  Parliament.  The  Bill  has  been
         costed and the additional allocations proposed in  the  2003  MTBPS
         provide for its implementation.


     *  Implementation  of  the  child  abuse  and  neglect  strategy.   The
         Department also intends implementing  victim  empowerment  measures
         that focus on the anti-rape strategy and its strategy  on  shelters
         for abused women and children.


     * Transformation of welfare services, focusing primarily on  review  of
         the  funding  provided  to  NGOs,  and  the   development   of   an
         appropriate financing policy.


     * The implementation of recommendations of the Ministerial Committee on
         Elderly Abuse which entails the formulation  of  new  policies  and
         legislation,  audit  and  inspection  of  old-age  homes  and   the
         development of norms and standards.


     3.3    THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH


     The Department's presentation  focused  on  system  and  administrative
     challenges. The  proposed  2003  MTEF  projects  substantial  budgetary
     increase for the health sector, averaging 10 percent  a  year  for  the
     sector  over  the  next  three  years.  Priority  areas  are  HIV/AIDS,
     personnel, infrastructure, and a general health sector adjustment.


     3.3.1  More resources are requested for:


     * Health inflation. The Department requested a  general  adjustment  in
         the context of higher than expected health/medical inflation.


     * Strengthening the Enhanced Response to HIV/AIDS. Strategy in  respect
         of the roll-out of the Prevention of  Mother-to-child  Transmission
         programme  and  provision  of  Post   Exposure   Prophylactics   to
         survivors  of  sexual  assault,  in  accordance  with  the   recent
         Constitutional Court decision.


     *  Personnel  concerns,  including  community  service   provision   to
         additional categories of medical personnel;  inflation  adjustments
         to rural and scarce  skills  allowances;  and  mid-level  posts  to
         relieve medical professionals from administrative duties.


     * Health infrastructure - while there  is  increased  spending  on  the
         Hospital  Revitalisation  Programme,   additional   resources   are
         required.


     * Provincial role: Strengthened interaction between  provincial  health
         departments  and  treasuries  is  needed  to  ensure  that  funding
         reaches priority health areas.


     3.4    DEPARTMENT OF PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT


     3.4.1  Priorities and challenges


     The strategic priorities of the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
     Government are to:
     * Provide leadership and guidance to the process  of  local  government
         transformation;


     * Provide direct  technical  and  material  support  to  provinces  and
         municipalities  in  fulfilling  their  constitutional   roles   and
         functions;


     * Coordinate the implementation of  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural
         Development Programme  (ISRDP)  and  the  Urban  Renewal  Programme
         (URP);


     *  Establish  a  policy  framework   for   government-wide   integrated
         development planning.


     3.4.2  Programmes and activity focus


     In  respect  of  basic  services  and  infrastructure  provision,   the
     Department is focusing on:


     * The Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP),
     * Consolidating capital grants to municipalities, and


     * Strengthening provision of free basic services to poor communities.


     The redemarcation of 843 municipalities into 243 by December 2000 calls
     for  an  intensive  programme  targeted  towards  consolidating   local
     government. The Department is  following  a  three-phased  approach  to
     building developmental local government in terms of its  establishment,
     consolidation and sustainability.


     The Urban Renewal Programme is  aimed  at  promoting  and  facilitating
     sustainable development in the 8 (initial) urban nodes by  implementing
     an innovative model of integrated  planning,  budgeting,  delivery  and
     governance across the three spheres of government.


     Progress to date includes:


     * Establishment of basic institutional arrangements  across  all  three
         spheres


     * Identification of, and mobilisation of support for anchor projects in
         each node


     * Finalisation of a national implementation framework


     * Finalisation of a national urban policy


     The complementary Integrated Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme
     focuses on promoting and facilitating sustainable development in the 13
     (initial) rural nodes.


     Progress to date includes:


     * Establishing institutional arrangements, in particular the supportive
         role   that   the   Independent   Development   Trust   plays    in
         implementation;


     * Identification of 120 anchor projects in the 13 nodes


     * Allocation of additional funds through the CMIP and local  government
         equitable share funding stream


     * Finalisation of a national implementation framework


     4.    THE PROTECTION SERVICES CLUSTER


     MTEF cluster priority: Strengthen the fight against crime.


     The Joint Budget Committee requested the departments in the  Integrated
     Justice Sector  -  Safety  and  Security,  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development and Correctional Services - to appear before the Committee.


     4.1    THE DEPARTMENT OF SAFETY AND SECURITY


     The Department of Safety and Security welcomed the 2003  MTBPS,  noting
     that it addresses key policy priority areas, such as expanding capacity
     in the  safety  and  security  sector  to  prevent  and  combat  crime,
     additional resources to address  crimes  against  women  and  children,
     supplementary  infrastructure  allocations,  the   adoption   of   more
     localised (sector) policing and the increase of policing personnel.


     4.1.1  Implementation priorities


     The main spending pressures  and  policy  priorities  in  the  policing
     sector over the next three years relate  to  addressing  infrastructure
     shortcomings  and  the  issue  of   personnel   shortages.   Additional
     allocations enable the department to:


     * Maintain implementation of the departmental strategic  plan  that  is
         focused on the prevention and combatting of crime, and  improvement
         of service delivery.


     * Fully resource the units of the South African Police  Service  (SAPS)
         that are responsible  for  the  investigation  of  cases  involving
         crimes against women and children.


     * Increase the SAPS  personnel  contingent  by  an  additional  28  560
         personnel over the period 2002 -2005. This is  an  increase  of  16
         200 police officers and 12 360 civilian employees.  The  additional
         civilian employees will  further  enable  trained  police  officers
         currently involved in  administrative  duties  to  be  released  to
         active policing.


     * Strengthen  local  policing  through  implementation  of  the  sector
         policing  approach,  which  will  specifically   address   violence
         against women and children.


     * Improve conditions of police stations,  and  build  new  stations  in
         areas that are underserviced. An additional station for  Inanda  is
         also planned for 2003.


     *  Modernise  the  police  vehicle  fleet  and  information  technology
         infrastructure.


     * Together with partners in the Integrated  Justice  Sector,  implement
         the sector modernisation strategy that integrates relevant  systems
         and  links  the  information  technology  systems  of   SAPS,   the
         Departments   of   Justice    and    Constitutional    Development,
         Correctional Services and Social Development.


     * Provide for payment of death benefits for  police  officers  who  are
         murdered, in accordance with Cabinet's recent decision. The  family
         of such members will receive a once-off cash payment  of  R200  000
         in addition to whatever other benefits they may  be  entitled.  The
         death benefit compensates  for  the  high  risk  rating  of  police
         personnel by the private sector insurance companies.


     The Department noted that due to high  prevalence  of  crime  in  South
     Africa, there will always be spending pressures in the sector. However,
     the Department believes that the balanced approach of  the  2003  MTBPS
     will enable adequate service provision  in  combating  crime  over  the
     medium term.


     The Department noted that it would be recruiting and  training  16  200
     police personnel over  the  next  three  years.  This  is  the  maximum
     capacity of the police training institutions. It is also  important  to
     ensure that capacity is balanced across the integrated justice sector.


     The Committee raised the question of the adequacy of  Child  Protection
     Units (CPUs), given the high and rising  incidence  of  crimes  against
     children. The Department responded that there  are  currently  45  CPUs
     located in areas where the incidence  of  crimes  against  children  is
     higher. To expand this service, SAPS  is  moving  towards  an  approach
     where police units are not overspecialised, and is  therefore  focusing
     on training.


     4.2    DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT


     4.2.1  Priorities


     The 2002 MTBPS directs additional funding over the next three years  to
     the Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  targeting
     improvement of court efficiency in order to reduce the case backlog  in
     the system.


     To address this, a series of mutually reinforcing  measures  have  been
     introduced  specifically  aimed  at  improving  court  efficiency   and
     reducing court case backlogs:


     * Saturday and Additional courts have been introduced  as  a  temporary
         measure to reduce the number of cases on the court roll;
     * A new policy has been introduced which  specifies  more  clearly  the
         criteria applicable for judging if a case is fit  for  trial.  This
         will in lead to a decrease in the number of cases withdrawn;


     * On a pilot basis, 26  semi-automated  IJS  court  centres  have  been
         established with a focus on improved  management  and  coordination
         of court processes;


     * A Diversion programme provides alternative  sentencing  for  juvenile
         offenders, in keeping with the  principles  of  the  Child  Justice
         Bill;


     * Phased implementation of the special sexual offences courts;


     * Enhanced financial and budget  management  procedures.  Key  projects
         include  the  PPP  cash-hall  management  project   and   increased
         forensic audits. The cash-hall management  project  refers  to  the
         Department's intention to outsource  its  central  cash  management
         function  to  reduce  fraud  and  corruption  and  improve  service
         delivery, particularly as regards payment of maintenance to  single
         parent families;


     * Capacity building and upgrading of the Masters  Office.  (Magistrates
         previously did  the  administration  of  Black  estates.  With  the
         separation of functions between the  judiciary  and  administrative
         personnel, this has now  become  the  sole  responsibility  of  the
         Masters Office.)


     The Chief Financial Officer addressed problems with the  management  of
     the Department's deposit trust fund. The  Department  agreed  with  the
     Auditor General's summary that here were "huge losses" from this  fund,
     which manages inter alia child maintenance money.  The  Department  had
     requested R100 million to speedily outsource management  to  a  Public-
     Private Partnership.  However,  Treasury  regulations  require  private
     sector transaction advisors  to  investigate  the  feasibility  of  the
     project, while the Department is concerned about delays.


     4.3    DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES


     The Department of Correctional  Services  manages  the  output  of  the
     criminal justice system, being responsible for detaining  prisoners  in
     safe custody following their arrest and conviction.


     4.3.1  Priorities in the MTBPS period


     * Develop a Green Paper on Correctional Services;


     * Create a culture of good  governance  to  combat  corruption,  crime,
         malpractice, and maladministration;


     * Improve the skills capacity of lower level staff and the retention of
         skilled personnel;
     * Improve prison management;
     * Take appropriate measures to adequately address the special needs  of
         targeted prisoner categories, including  the  youth,  females,  the
         aged, pregnant females and  mothers  with  infants,  terminally-ill
         prisoners the mentally challenged and prisoners with disabilities;


     * Enhance rehabilitation programmes;


     * Enhance prisoner peer-educator programmes;


     * Improve the maintenance and repair of facilities;


     * Increase prison accommodation to reduce overcrowding;


     * Develop criteria for implementation of  public  private  partnerships
         within the context of correctional services.


     The Committee was concerned about personnel expenditure. The Department
     indicated that 80% of its core budget is spent on personnel,  and  that
     high workloads were still a key concern.


     The need for new prisons was a subject for  debate,  one  view  in  the
     Department being  that  focusing  budgetary  resources  on  social  and
     economic development rather than building new prisons would reduce  the
     pressure on prison  populations  in  time.  Meanwhile,  the  Department
     responded that about 70 percent of South Africa's prisons are more than
     50 years old. The Department has divided maintenance and  upgrading  of
     these prisons into 2 phases: the first comprising 33  prisons  and  the
     second comprising 146 prisons. The Department also  intends  to  build,
     rather than rent, head office accommodation.


     * Black economic empowerment  of  procurement  awards:  The  department
         noted its  difficulty  in  validating  black  economic  empowerment
         credentials of tender  applicants.  It  requested  the  Committee's
         assistance in this regard.
     * In response to questions regarding the high incidence of HIV/AIDS and
         TB among prisoners, the Department responded that HIV/AIDS  may  be
         contracted  prior  to  imprisonment  and  that   deterioration   of
         affected prisoners  may  be  accelerated  through  the  overcrowded
         conditions in prisons.


     5.     THE ECONOMIC SERVICES CLUSTER


     The Economic Services cluster of departments is  pivotal  in  realising
     two of the sets of priorities which structure the MTBPS, namely:


     * Employment Creation and Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)


     * Land reform and agricultural development.


     The budget committee invited six of the Departments in this cluster  to
     give evidence. In the event, only the Public Works Department (PWD) and
     the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)  did  so,  although  written
     submissions were received from the Department of Minerals  and  Energy,
     the Department of Labour, the National Department of  Agriculture,  and
     the Department of Land Affairs.


     5.1    THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY


     The  DTI's  presentation  focused  on  incentives  for  small  business
     development through its programme of  support  for  Small,  Medium  and
     Micro enterprises. (SMMEs), and associated employment creation. It then
     reviewed a range of its industrial development support programmes.


     5.1.1  SMME support strategy


     Key strategies for SMME sector development are:


     * Greater coordination across  government  departments,  with  the  DTI
         taking the lead role.


     * Partnership between different sheres of government, provincial, local
         and metropolitan councils, with  metropolitan  councils  playing  a
         particularly important part in improving the environment for  small
         business to thrive. The DTI is already at work on this.


     * Improved access to finance by a better coordination  of  the  various
         financing instruments within the DTI Group of  Institutions.  There
         will  be  a  targeted,  project  centred  focus  which  is  further
         informed by the Integrated Manufacturing Strategy,  or  initiatives
         such  as  Industrial   Development   Zones   (IDZs)   and   Spatial
         Development Initiatives (SDIs), and with  a  new  emphasis  on  co-
         operatives.


     Khula and Ntsika,  the  DTI-linked  agencies  that  provide  access  to
     finance and training, are being restructured to work more closely under
     common direction. The  DTI  is  also  setting  up  a  call  centre  for
     immediate access to advice.
     5.1.2  Key strategies and programmes


     * The Motor Industry Development Programme  (MIDP),  highly  successful
         and to be extended


     * The Strategic Investment Programme (SIP)


     * Industrial Development Zones (IDZs)


     *  Customised  support  for  targeted  sectors  under  the   Industrial
         Management Strategy (IMS).


     * The National Research  and  Development  Strategy,  notably  the  key
         technology   platforms   of   Biotechnology   and   ICT;   Advanced
         Manufacturing and developing new knowledge  based  industries  from
         the resource-based industries.


     The committee was concerned about the company registration process, and
     its costliness and inaccessibility to informal  sector  operators.  The
     DTI undertook to provide details. Modes of monitoring BEE  also  demand
     clear definition and criteria.


     5.2    THE NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS


     The NPWD's task is management of national  departments'  accommodation,
     housing, land and infrastructure. It aims to develop  a  transformation
     framework for the property and construction sectors.  The  NPWD's  MTEF
     budget  increases  slightly  in  2003,  after  having  dropped  due  to
     underspending. However, this year the Department expects to overspend.


     In its presentation to the Committee,  the  NPWD  focused  on  its  own
     system challenges, and shortcomings of the MTEF in terms of its needs.


     Primary issues were:


     * The  NPWD  is  finding  it  extremely  difficult  to  retain  skilled
         personnel


     * It needs uniform guidelines for public immovable asset management


     * Its information systems need upgrading and integration


     * The NPWD felt the National Treasury had allocated insufficient  funds
         for costs on leased and rented state property which it was  obliged
         to pay


     *  The  increasing  diversion  of  poverty  alleviation  funds  to  the
         Municipal Investment Fund is causing concern  within  the  NPWD  in
         relation to its poverty alleviation projects. These are also  being
         reviewed by Treasury.


     Achievements  included  BEE  in  construction  projects,  in   property
     disposed of, and contractors and consultants preferred in terms of  the
     Preferential Employment Policy Framework Act. The Department  has  also
     been active in poverty relief and human capacity development projects.


     In response to committee questions, however, the  NRWD  was  unable  to
     quantify the budgetary shortfall in  lease  and  rental  costs,  or  to
     specify the number of persons  benefited  by  its  poverty  alleviation
     projects.


     5.3    THE DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY


     The Department  of  Minerals  and  Energy  provided  the  Joint  Budget
     committee with a written submission. It reported  on  elements  of  its
     activities relevant to employment creation and BEE, on developments  in
     the energy sector, and on challenges facing it.


     5.3.1  Employment Creation and BEE


     * The Broad-based Socio-economic Empowerment Charter sets  targets  for
         black  equity   in   the   industry,   provides   for   empowerment
         contracting, and intensive skills development.


     * The Oil Charter, voluntary at present, provides for 25 percent  black
         equity by 2010, empowerment contracting, and skills development.


     * The Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP) is providing
         accelerated delivery of infrastructure.  30  percent  of  contracts
         have been awarded to empowerment groups, and  maintenance  will  be
         done affirmatively.


     * Restructuring the electricity industry  for  global  competitiveness,
         and efficiency also includes provision for free  basic  electricity
         and BEE participation in the electricity sector.


     * Fostering women's and children's participation  in  the  mineral  and
         energy sectors.
     5.4    THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR


     The submission of the Department of Labour endorses the MTEF's emphasis
     on employment creation and black economic empowerment  as  core  issues
     for a poverty eradication strategy.


     5.4.1  The Human Resources Development Strategy


     The Minister of Education and  the  Director  General  of  Labour  have
     jointly been appointed to head the national human Resources Development
     (HRD) Strategy. Its four key strategies are:


     *  Improving  the  foundations  for  human  development   through   the
         programmes for Early Childhood Development; Adult  Basic  Education
         and Training, and General Education.


     * Improving the supply of  quality  and  scarce  skills,  incorporating
         Higher and further education transformation and bursary schemes.


     * Increasing employer participation in lifelong learning in both public
         and private sectors.  Sector  Education  and  Training  authorities
         (SETAs) are expected to signal the learning needs  of  the  economy
         to the education and training sector.


     *  Industrial  policies,  support  for  innovation  and  research   and
         development are essential to employment  growth,  and  are  rightly
         prioritised in the MTBPS.


     5.5    THE NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE


     5.5.1  Agricultural sector plan


     The National Department of Agriculture's submission indicates  that  it
     is developing a sector plan to address disparities and success elements
     in the sector. An initial workshop was held in August 2002.
     The  plan's  key  objectives  are:  growth;   competitiveness;   wealth
     redistribution; strong leadership; and sustainability. Also  identified
     were challenges; opportunities; and leverage points. A discussion paper
     is being drafted  to  form  a  basis  for  broader  consultation,  with
     individual stakeholder consultations  scheduled  from  January/February
     2003. Internal management discussions are also in progress.


     5.5.2  Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) within the plan


     The first draft of a BEE policy acceptable to all  stakeholders  within
     agriculture is to be finalised at the end of March 2003.


     Consultation to develop sub-sector strategies  which  include  BEE  and
     growth components is under way with:


     * The red meat industry


     * The cotton industry, and
     * Grain SA


     Empowerment  project  proposals   worth   R16   851   295   are   under
     consideration, including:


     * A wool improvement project by the Mineworkers Union


     * Potato participation by Potato SA project


     * Bull improvement and database projects by NEPRO


     * A cooperative development initiative linking small  co-operatives  to
         big business and an investigation into piloting empowerment; and


     * A Goat Value Chain in the north-west,  covering  Limpopo,  Mpumalanga
         and Gauteng provinces.


     A database of service providers  is  being  continuously  developed  to
     support promotion of BEE in the sector plan implementation.


     5.6    THE DEPARTMENT OF LAND AFFAIRS


     The  Department  of  Land  Affairs'  written  submission  comprised  an
     overview of activities, and tables exerpted from its strategic plan for
     the MTEF  period.  The  MTEF  points  out  that  almost  half  of  land
     restitution claims have been settled,  with  more  complex  and  larger
     claims now becoming the focus.


     5.6.1  Restitution activities


     The Department's strategy is  to  accelerate  the  settlement  of  land
     restitution claims, with  a  focus  on  rural  claims  and  sustainable
     projects aimed at poverty alleviation. The Department estimates that 80
     percent of the claims to be settled during  the  MTEF  period  will  be
     rural. Some 28 percent of the  settled  claims  will  be  targeted  for
     sustainable development under the following programmes:


     * Urban Renewal Programme (URP);


     * Ownership in nature conservation and biodiversity;


     * Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD); and


     * Stock and game farming.


     Validation of approximately 40 000 outstanding claims  is  planned  for
     completion in 2002/2003. This will be followed by the  verification  of
     all claimants to be finalised by December 2004. During this MTEF period
     approximately 205 000 households will benefit from the settlement of 24
     932 claims representing 1, 4 million hectares.


     5.6.2  Land Reform


     To achieve  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  land  ownership,  the
     Department will step up the implementation of the following programmes:


     *  The  Land  Redistribution  for   Agricultural   Development   (LRAD)
         programme;


     * Land  redistribution  for  commonages,  equities  and  other  related
         projects;


     * The acquisition of land for settlement;


     * Land delivered to Labour Tenants; and


     * Land acquired in support of the Urban Renewal Programme.


     For the MTEF period it is estimated that 76 902 households will benefit
     from the implementation of the above programmes, which will yield 2 708
     projects representing 896 299 hectares.


     A further 287 812 hectares of state land will be  disposed  of  in  the
     MTEF period.
     SECTION 6: DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS


     MTEF priority: administrative upgrading.


     6.1.1  Problems and priorities


     The Department's presentation focused mainly on  system  challenges  to
     service delivery. The major problem areas  were  highlighted  and  then
     steps to improve service delivery were discussed.


     The  Departments  main  focus  is  enhanced  capacity  to  maintain  an
     effective population  register  and  identification  system.  The  Home
     Affairs National Identification System (HANIS) will  receive  increased
     funding over the MTEF period to complete the  current  digitisation  of
     population records, and to begin the production  of  an  electronically
     readable smart card to replace the present ID booklets.


     The Department has obtained allocation of funding for key projects, but
     feels however that these are underfunded. The critical areas  of  under
     funding are:


     * Rural areas: the department wants  mobile  services  to  expand  into
         rural areas. The Committee noted that this was of  extreme  concern
         and the dept responded that they were acutely aware of this need.


     * Centre for illegal aliens: The question was raised by  the  Committee
         as to whether this centre was  functioning  well  and  managing  to
         assist people coming in. The department responded that  the  number
         of refugees  is  increasing,  and  therefore  expenditure  at  this
         centre will also increase. In addition, immigration  officers  need
         vehicles to perform their functions.


     * Screening: Persons seeking entry into the country  are  not  properly
         screened from a security viewpoint,  before  being  admitted.  Poor
         facilities create loopholes enabling persons to enter  the  country
         without reporting to  an  immigration  officer  for  the  necessary
         checks and controls.


     * Personnel: Some 1100 posts remain vacant. The Committee  pointed  out
         that surely this was one area the department should  prioritise  in
         trying  to  achieve  its   goal   of   better   service   delivery.
         Understaffing leads to longer queues. In response  to  a  question,
         the department said that they mainly used consultants in  the  area
         of IT to assist with the HANIS project, and only  spend  about  R16
         million on consultants.


     6.1.2  Efforts to improve services


     The department is moving from manual processes to  electronic  systems.
     The department is implementing an electronic document management system
     within  civic  services  which  will  improve  business   process   and
     efficiency, and will make Home Affairs  records  immediately  available
     both nationally and internationally.


     It is investigating the devolution of the  delivery  of  civic  affairs
     functions to municipalities, so that citizens will be  able  to  obtain
     identification documents, registrations of birth, deaths and  marriages
     and related certificates from a variety of points, using the  municipal
     infrastructure, which  is  already  in  place.  In  the  meantime,  the
     department has embarked on a process  of  negotiating  with  local  and
     rural authorities for co-operation in the rendering  of  services.  The
     department wishes  to  establish  multi-purpose  community  centres  to
     integrate service delivery at  community  level,  especially  in  rural
     areas.


     Identity system:  The Committee expressed  concern  that  the  original
     contract price for the first stage of  the  HANIS  project  (AFIS)  had
     increased from 930 million to approximately 1.5 billion. The  Committee
     raised the point that the initial contract was  based  on  an  exchange
     rate of the R6 to  the  dollar  and  was  now  very  out  of  date  and
     inaccurate. The projected cost for the second stage  of  HANIS,  namely
     SENIC amounts to 2 billion. The Committee noted the discussions between
     National Treasury and the department to explore  the  restructuring  of
     the next phase of HANIS as a PPP.


     7.1    THE FINANCIAL AND FISCAL COMMISSION (FFC)


     The Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) has a  statutory  mandate  to
     recommend on the Division of Revenue in the main budget and to  comment
     on all money bills.


     Section 214(2)(a) - (j) of the Constitution sets out factors  in  terms
     of which  the  FFC  should  asses  the  division  of  revenue.  In  its
     presentation, which reflected an earlier assessment at  this  stage  in
     the cycle, the FFC focused on:


     * Provisions for national debt and obligations;


     * National government's needs and interests;
     *  The  ability  of  provinces  and  municipalities  to  provide  basic
         services;


     * Fiscal capacity of provinces and municipalities;


     * The developmental needs of provinces and municipalities;


     * Stability and predictability of revenue shares.


     7.1.1  FFC's proposals of May 2002 for the 2003 MTEF


     In its presentation to the Committee, the FFC reviewed its  comparative
     analysis of  the  2002/3  budget  and  2002  MTEF.  It  summarised  the
     proposals it had made to feed into the 2003 MTEF, which were  presented
     to Parliament in May 2002:


     a)     FFC's proposals with regard to local government:
         *  Build creditworthiness in municipalities  with  little  capacity
              to access debt through  infrastructure  grants,  institutional
              capacity  building  programmes  and  clarified  accountability
              between the three spheres of government;


         *  Further consider of the division of functions between local  and
              district  municipalities  noting  existing  local   government
              policy  and  the  primary  role  of  national  government   in
              redistributing resources.  Local  governments  should  in  the
              longer term deliver services to residents;


         *  Incorporate considerations of councillor remuneration in the  I-
              element of the LES;


         *   Consider  the  relationship  between  regional  and   municipal
              electricity distributors, noting  the  option  of  a  levy  to
              compensate  distributing  municipalities  for  asset  transfer
              losses and to enable inter-municipal revenue sharing. National
              grants could be used to provide  free  basic  electricity  and
              overcome capital backlogs for the poor.


     b)     FFC's proposals with regard to provincial government:


         *   Conditional  grant  funding  mechanisms  for  Early   Childhood
              Development should continue until  they  can  be  incorporated
              into the Provincial Equitable share (PES) mechanism.


         *   A  conditional  grant  was  considered  the  most   appropriate
              mechanism for  targeting  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  whilst  a
              suitable information base is established.


     c)     Cross Cutting Equitable Share Issues
         *  The FFC offered  guidelines  for  reviewing  the  Taylor  Report
              (Comprehensive  Social  Security  Review)  and  proposed   the
              establishment  of  a  national  social  security   agency   to
              administer the payment of pension  and  child  support  grants
              over the medium to long term.  National  government  announced
              that this was under way.


         *  The FFC  proposes  that  it,  with  Parliament  and  Government,
              review the inter-governmental fiscal system in  the  light  of
              the Bill of Rights and section 214(2)(a)  to  (j).  Particular
              note is to be taken of data collection and  inter-governmental
              fiscal capacity building requirements.


         *  A tiered system of municipal, provincial  and  national  funding
              thresholds  was  proposed  for  various  aspects  of  disaster
              management.


         *  Finally, the FFC proposed that a legal basis be  established  to
              enable   contingency   reserves   to   accommodate    disaster
              management, macro-economic shocks and new policy priorities.


     7.1.2  FFC's analysis of 2002/3 Budget and 2003 MTEF


     a)     The national budget


     This year's adjusted macro-economic projections reflect the  impact  of
     the (nearly) 40 percent depreciation  of  the  rand  last  year.  These
     include expectations of  higher  (export-led)  economic  growth  and  a
     nearly 3 percent increase in expected inflation for 2003/4.


     Trends relating to spending include:


         *  As a proportion of GDP,  government  spending  is  projected  to
              rise faster than revenue. This may reflect additional spending
              pressures and/or  the  approach  of  capacity  limitations  in
              revenue collection. The result is that the deficit is expected
              to rise sharply next year, but will fall in the following  two
              years.


         *  Tax room of approximately 2.5 percent of  GDP  is  targeted  for
              other "general government"  bodies  including  provincial  and
              municipal governments.


         *  The national deficit is projected to rise sharply next year.


         *  Over the medium to long-term, a higher national deficit  impacts
              on debt-servicing costs. Debt servicing costs are expected  to
              decline, as a proportion of government expenditure,  over  the
              medium-term between 16 percent and 15 percent.


         *  Debt servicing costs  displace  funds  otherwise  available  for
              division between the 3 spheres to deliver services.


         *  Real growth of funds available  for  division  is  projected  to
              grow to nearly 6 percent next year  and  4  percent  over  the
              medium-term. This enables growth in  per  capita  spending  on
              constitutionally mandated basic services.


         *  The projected vertical division of revenue reflects  a  counter-
              shift from  the  national  to  the  provincial  sphere  and  a
              continued shift to the local  sphere.  This  may  reflect  the
              demands on the social security  and  health  systems  and  the
              consolidation of the new local government system.


     b)     Analysis of Provincial Budgets:


         *  Unconditional Equitable share funding continues to be  preferred
              over conditional grants as a mechanism for funding  provincial
              governments.


         *  Significant differences in the recent past  and  projected  real
              growth of social security, health and education  spending  for
              the 2002 MTEF have been narrowed.


         *   Healthy  real  growth  of  8.3   percent   is   projected   for
              infrastructure capital grants over the medium-term.


         *   Both  the   Integrated   Nutrition   Programme   and   HIV/AIDS
              conditional grants have been substantially consolidated.


     c)     Analysis of Municipal Budgets:


         *  Evidence from the  recent  past  reflects  that  89  percent  of
              municipal revenue is collected from own sources. However, most
              of this is collected by Metropolitan authorities.  Many  rural
              local and district councils are heavily reliant on funds  from
              national government.


         *  Municipal deficits have been rising in the  recent  past  to  an
              average 2.5 percent of municipal budgets in 2000/1.


         *  Real  annual  growth  of  15  percent  for  LES  allocations  is
              projected. This will enable growth in per capita  spending  on
              basic municipal services.


     8.     CIVIL SOCIETY


     FEDUSA - a labour-based body - and People's Budget (representing  views
     of COSATU, SANGOCO and the SACC)  were  civil  society  inputs  to  the
     Budget Committee.


     8.1    FEDUSA SUBMISSION


     FEDUSA acknowledges that  the  2003  MTBPS  and  MTEF  already  contain
     aspects  that  will  foster  growth  and  development   and   therefore
     employment, though they would like to see looser deficit  controls  and
     even more infrastructure expenditure.


     8.2.1  Perceived priority issues


     a)     Unemployment:


     As there is no short-term solution to this problem, in the  short  term
     it is necessary to provide for the unemployed and the poor by way of  a
     safety net. FEDUSA Welcomes the provision for social services  of  more
     than 57  percent  of  consolidated  non-interest  spending  (education,
     health, social security and other social services) in 2002/3 that  will
     increase by 3.6 percent in real terms over the MTEF period.  They  also
     welcome the increased provision of basic services  such  as  water  and
     electricity to households, especially in the rural areas.


     b)     Investment


     Welcome steps include:


     *  A  continuation   of   accelerated   depreciation   allowances   for
         manufacturing assets


     * Extended tax relief for small businesses


     * Increasing support for national research and development strategy


     * Increased expenditure on safety and security,  to  create  a  climate
         conducive to investment


     * Increased government expenditure in real terms over the MTEF period.


     c)     Savings


     FEDUSA feels  that  private  savings  should  be  encouraged  and  that
     retirement savings should not be liable for personal  income  taxation.
     The minister is urged to give serious consideration to an  increase  in
     the tax exemption level of savings, and to lowering the retirement fund
     tax rate substantially. Both will directly and indirectly  benefit  our
     levels of savings.


     VAT zero-rating should be extended to include basic  services  such  as
     electricity and water, regardless of the amount used. This would  be  a
     means of offering relief to lower income groups.


     d)     Local Government Finances


     A portion of the equitable share  allocation  could  be  used  for  the
     purpose  of  meeting  debt  demands.  A  concern  is  that   there   is
     infrastructure development with  no  upgrading  of  existing  services.
     Infrastructure maintenance should not just focus on roads,  but  should
     also prioritise water purification and sanitation.


     e)     Restructuring of Higher Education


     FEDUSA is  concerned  that  no  figures  have  been  provided  for  the
     restructuring. It questions the capacity of the higher education sector
     to manage all the proposed mergers while sustaining  ongoing  delivery.
     They referred the committee to  a  report  by  their  affiliate,  South
     African  Parastatal  and  Tertiary  Institution  Union   (SAPTU),   The
     Transformation and Reconstruction of  the  Higher  Education  System  -
     Labour Perspective.


     f)     Food pricing and the Basic Income Grant:


     FEDUSA feels that a basic income grant is not a practical  solution  to
     the problem of high food prices. When asked by the Committee to provide
     more detail on this, they felt that the basic income grant system would
     be fraught with fraud and corruption in that the money would not go  to
     the people it needs to go to.


     g)     Umsobomvu Fund:


     The success of the fund should be publicised, since a perception exists
     that the fund is not spending in line with its original intent.
     h)     Increased spending on HIV/AIDS:


     FEDUSA fully supports this.


     8.2    PEOPLE'S BUDGET SUBMISSION


     The People's Budget did not appear before the committee, but  furnished
     written  submission  setting  out  its  responses  to  the  MTBPS.  The
     responses relevant to MTBPS sections 5 and 6 are as follows:


     * The trend  to  increased  spending  is  welcome,  but  an  even  more
         expansionary budget could be  devised  by  avoiding  tax  cuts  and
         increasing expenditure-to-GDP rations.


     *  Allocations  between  national,  provincial  and  local   government
         spending  should  be  revised,  with  greater  increases  to  local
         government service delivery.


     * They welcome the modest real growth in spending on  social  services,
         but observe that, in many  areas,  expenditure  continues  to  fall
         short of the expectations outlined in the People's Budget.


     * Education, while welcoming the real growth in education spending, and
         planned Early Childhood Development and Adult Basic  Education  and
         Training commitments, People's budget  urges  proposals  to  reform
         the school fees system.


     * Increased allocations for health care are encouraging but  they  will
         be thinly spread over  additional  personnel,  HIV/AIDS  prevention
         and treatment,  hospital  buildings  and  rising  medical  supplies
         costs.


     * More alarming is the modest growth in welfare spending over the cycle
         of the MTEF, especially  in  view  of  government's  constitutional
         obligations and policy commitments. Government should  be  planning
         for dramatic growth in welfare spending  to  accommodate  extension
         of the Child Support Grant and preparations for the roll-out  of  a
         Basic Income Grant.


     * They applaud declining defence expenditure but call for  reallocation
         of funds to support job creation and peacekeeping.


     * They support plans to extend electricity and free basic services  and
         sanitation.


     * They express concern about the lack of resources available  for  land
         redistribution. They wish to see redistribution of  assets  coupled
         to  a  Basic  Income  Grant.  Housing  increases   are   also   not
         sufficient, in their view.


     In  administration  expenditure,  the  People's  Budget  welcomes   the
     earmarking of funds for the roll-out of HANIS, the 2004 elections,  and
     efforts to improve government's effective spending capacity.


     They reiterate their call for the introduction of a  multiple-tier  VAT
     system over the medium-term, coupled with measures to prevent retailers
     from profiteering. They affirm the work  of  SARS  in  encouraging  tax
     morality and compliance.


     On capacity to spend: They endorse the some of the successes which  the
     Minister cited in the MTBPS, but  point  to  the  need  to  avoid  easy
     recourse to "capacity problems" to explain  failure  to  spend.  It  is
     vital to conduct more thorough analysis of the obstacles  to  spending,
     as well as good planning and implementing practices that facilitate the
     efficient use of public  resources.  They  raised  concerns  about  the
     admission that almost R6 million in  infrastructure  development  funds
     were unused because they had not been properly allocated.


     Budget Documentation  and  Indicators:  They  call  on  departments  to
     develop a system of indicators to facilitate tracking  of  progress  in
     achieving targets and combating poverty. Data should be collected in  a
     manner that permits disaggregation by gender, income  level,  race  and
     province.
