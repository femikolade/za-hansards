            ABSENCE OF MEMBERS OF EXECUTIVE DURING QUESTION TIME

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! The first item on  the  Order  Paper  is
Questions. We will therefore proceed to Questions that are on  the  Question
Paper.

I am extremely concerned to note that members  of  the  executive  have  not
deigned to appear in the House. We had this experience more than  two  years
ago. I am not sure what the reasons are, because  we  had  confirmation.  We
are pleased that the Ministry of Finance is here.

I am perturbed by this and I shall, of course, indicate my  concern  to  the
Leader of Government Business,  the  Deputy  President.  We  will,  however,
proceed. The House cannot  be  held  back  in  terms  of  dealing  with  its
business.

QUESTIONS AND REPLIES - see that book.

                              NOTICE OF MOTION

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting  of  the
Council, I shall move:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) Ms Brigalia Bam of the IEC declared that  the  DA  had  suffered  the
       largest losses of all political parties during the crossover period;


  (2) the DA has been reduced by more than a quarter at municipal level;


  (3) what is left of the DA will also join in fleeing from its leader Tony
       Leon during the following window period and election;


  (4) the DA's scare tactics in portraying the ANC as  some  sort  of  arch
       demon have backfired dramatically - 51 DA  members  have  joined  the
       ANC, 340 councillors have joined the New NP  in  coalition  with  the
       ANC, and 22 councillors of the UCDP, a partner of the DA,  have  also
       taken up ANC membership; and


  (5) such scare tactics are outdated and therefore do  not  contribute  to
       nation-building.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

                           NEW MAYOR OF CAPE TOWN
                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates alderman Nomaindia Mfeketo on her  appointment  as  the
       new mayor of the City of Cape Town and welcomes the removal of Gerald
       Morkel from the mayoral office of the City of Cape Town by  the  ANC-
       New NP-led council today;


  (2) notes that Mr Morkel's removal confirms widely held  views  that  the
       former caretaker mayor of this city  has  irretrievably  tainted  the
       credibility  and  image  of  himself  and  his  party,   the   ``Dead
       Alliance'', through -


       (a)  their notorious association with a German fugitive who is wanted
           on the European continent on  numerous  charges  connected  with
           commercial and financial crimes;
       (b)  his unashamed  abuse  of  public  office  to  acquire  privately
           sponsored accommodation and  the  trappings  that  go  with  it,
           whilst poverty is out of control in the townships of Cape  Town;
           and


       (c)   his  boundless  contempt  for  the  intelligence  of  his   own
           constituency as  he  stumbles  from  one  flimsy  damage-control
           exercise to another; and


  (3) believes that under the leadership of the new  ANC  mayor,  Nomaindia
       Mfeketo, good governance, delivery to the poor, dignity and integrity
       will be restored to the City of Cape Town.  Yena  Nomaindia  Mfeketo,
       Yena!

[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection  to  the  motion?
There is an objection. The motion will therefore become a notice of motion.

     LEKGOTLA BETWEEN PRESIDENT MBEKI AND FORMER PRESIDENT F W DE KLERK

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the current Lekgotla taking place between  President  Mbeki  and
           former President F W  de  Klerk,  including  cabinet  ministers,
           business groups, educationists and clerics;


       (b)  that the Lekgotla is an ongoing initiative and the second of its
           kind, looking at ways to heal the country of its apartheid past,
           and to forge  unity  and  a  common  identity  among  all  South
           Africans;


       (c)  the pride South Africa can take in its leadership  that  extends
           beyond party-political lines to ensure a national  culture  that
           emphasises a country open to all its people to live in; and


       (d)  that we are further reminded of a statement made by Mr De  Klerk
           in a recent interview, where  he  said:  "We  need  a  political
           realignment which  moves  away  from  ethnicity  and  race-based
           politics towards value-based politics."; and


  (2) therefore -


       (a)  commends the two leaders  for  their  ongoing  commitment  to  a
           genuine South Africa of unity and strength;


       (b)  wishes them every success on the two day deliberations; and


       (c)  further commits itself  to  work  towards  the  same  goals  and
           objectives  of  nation-building  to  which   our   leaders   are
           committed, including building value-based politics.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                           THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that this month is dedicated to the rights of the child;


  (2) recognises and commends the Government for promoting public awareness
       of the rights of the child through the print and electronic media;


  (3) welcomes the initiatives of the  Department  of  Social  Development,
       including  the  maintenance  of  a  register  of   street   children,
       developing an appropriate protocol in relation to  child  abuse,  and
       further widening the net of social security;


  (4) further commends the Ministry for its  efforts  in  reaching  out  to
       children, particularly in rural areas, who  could  not  access  child
       grants previously;


  (5) acknowledges that today the Minister of  Finance  announced  a  27,5%
       increase in child grants; and


  (6) urges all members to promote and support the rights of the  child  in
       their various constituencies.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        DENIAL OF CUSTODY OVER CHILD
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the decision by a United States court to deny  the
       South African family of a child born in this country custody over the
       child because, in the opinion of the court, South Africa  was  not  a
       safe place for children to live in;


  (2) further notes that the court's decision was largely influenced by the
       evidence  of  a  former  South  African-born  American  academic  who
       portrayed her country of birth in the most negative of terms;


  (3) expresses its concern that in this particular case the decision  that
       South Africa was not a safe place for children to live in  was  based
       on the assessment of this  single  individual  and  not  an  official
       channel like the South African Embassy or Consulate; and


  (4) resolves to extend a cordial invitation to this  particular  academic
       and judge to come and experience first-hand the positive changes that
       have taken place in our country.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE COUNCIL: Order! Before I put that  motion,  I  assume
the invitation is at your cost, hon member. [Laughter.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          NEW EDUCATION CURRICULUM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) notes that the Department of Education has released a  new  education
       curriculum for comment from the public;


  (2) further notes that this curriculum is expected to produce pupils  who
       can identify and solve problems and make decisions using critical and
       creative thinking;


  (3) believes that this curriculum will instil in our young  citizens  the
       values that promote the interest of  society  based  on  respect  for
       democracy, equality, human dignity and social justice; and


  (4) therefore applauds the Minister of Education for  his  commitment  to
       improve the education system in South Africa.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               TRANSFER OF WRITTEN QUESTIONS TO ORAL QUESTIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) notes with extreme concern that 10 written questions to Ministers had
       to be transferred today in accordance with Rule 239 to oral questions
       because the Ministries and Departments  of  the  responsible  Cabinet
       Ministers have failed to  reply  in  writing  within  the  prescribed
       period;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  some of the questions transferred today date back to August 2002
           whilst the Internal Question Paper of Friday, 25  October  2002,
           reflects that there are written replies  outstanding  since  May
           and June 2002;


       (b)  the failure  to  reply  timeously  to  written  questions  shows
           serious contempt for the Rules of this Council which  deal  with
           written replies and  also  results  in  Ministers  unnecessarily
           having to come to Parliament to answer questions  -  time  which
           could have been spent more productively elsewhere; and


  (3) makes a friendly but urgent request to Cabinet  Ministers  to  ensure
       that their Ministries and Departments adopt a more positive  attitude
       and display a sense of responsibility  when  it  comes  to  answering
       written questions from members of this Council.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                PORT ELIZABETH TO BECOME TOURIST DESTINATION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes cognisance of the fact that Port Elizabeth is set to  become  a
       premier destination for tourists from Scandinavian countries; and


  (2) notes -


       (a)   that  SAAB  Technologies,  a  leading   Scandinavian   defence,
           aerospace and communications group, contributed R16  million  to
           upgrade and renovate McArthur Baths;


       (b)  that this development is intended to be the "centrepiece"  of  a
           major drive to attract tourists and  make  the  Eastern  Cape  a
           major tourist destination for Scandinavian holidaymakers;


       (c)  that the sale of flight tickets and  hotel  accommodation  as  a
           result of this initiative has been nothing short of  phenomenal;
           and


       (d)  the creation of jobs in the catering and leisure sector and  the
           empowerment of a number of local companies.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          ALLEGED SCHOOLBOY RAPIST

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with extreme concern a report in a Sunday  newspaper  about  an
       eleven-year-old boy who allegedly raped some of his classmates  after
       their class was left unsupervised for a week;


  (2) further notes that according to this newspaper  the  parents  of  the
       affected schoolgirls informed the school about their  suspicions  but
       that the school did not  immediately  inform  the  police  about  the
       alleged rapes;


  (3) believes this serious dereliction of duty on the part of  the  school
       authorities warrants an immediate investigation;


  (4) calls upon the  relevant  provincial  education  department  to  take
       appropriate steps to hold  whoever  is  responsible  for  the  smooth
       running of the school accountable for the suffering of  these  little
       girls; and


  (5) expresses its disappointment at the report that this young boy had to
       be detained "for his protection" at a juvenile detention place.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

        CONGRATULATIONS TO TWO LEARNERS FROM VOORTREKKER HIGH SCHOOL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that two learners from Voortrekker High School in Bethlehem  in
       the Eastern Free State, Laurine Scheepers and Sunicke de Klerk,  each
       won two gold medals for classical and contemporary music at the world
       championship for arts in Los Angeles in the USA; and


  (2) congratulates these two young women on their hours of hard work  that
       made this outstanding achievement for their country possible.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 SUICIDES AMONG MEMBERS OF SA POLICE SERVICE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that, during the period 1 September 2001 to 31 August 2002,  84
       members of the SA Police Service committed suicide and  that  stress-
       related symptoms led to the resignation of 1 298 members  of  the  SA
       Police Service during the same period;


  (2) expresses its  concern  regarding  this  unacceptable  situation  and
       expresses its sincerest condolences to the families  and  friends  of
       those members who have died so untimeously; and


  (3) requests the Government to take all steps which may be  necessary  to
       effectively address this state of affairs,  including  ensuring  that
       there are  sufficient  psychiatrists,  psychologists,  chaplains  and
       social workers available to adequately attend to  the  needs  of  all
       members of the SA Police Service.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
                      AFFAIRS - STUDY TOUR TO MALAYSIA

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson and hon members, I am making a statement  on  the
study tour to Malaysia. The Parliament of the Republic of South  Africa  has
a policy in terms of which it encourages  its  members  to  develop  skills,
knowledge and competencies which are appropriate to their  performing  their
public duties efficiently and effectively.

One of the mechanisms through which this objective can be  achieved  is  the
undertaking of study tours to countries at a similar  stage  of  development
as South Africa. In light of this policy, the Select Committee on  Land  and
Environmental Affairs undertook a study tour to Malaysia to learn  how  this
particular country has been dealing with problems encountered in  the  field
of agriculture, fishing, agritourism and technical co-operation  with  other
developing countries.

The tour was undertaken by a  multiparty  delegation,  and  we  were  highly
impressed by the innovative approach taken by  Malaysia,  particularly  with
respect  to  the  problems  surrounding  emerging  farmers  and  small-scale
fishers. Malaysia has worked  effectively  to  overcome  problems  in  these
sectors within a sustainable development  context,  and  we  left  with  the
impression that our country  had  important  lessons  to  learn  from  their
initiatives.

Our delegation received briefings  on  a  number  of  policy  processes  and
programmes,  including  development  planning  in  Malaysia,  the  Malaysian
Technical  Co-operation  Programme,  and  the   country's   third   national
agricultural policy. We also  paid  on-site  visits  to  a  number  of  very
successful projects, such as the aquaculture project,  an  agrotechnological
park, a agrotourism project, a women's extension group  project,  and  group
farming projects. On the basis of this visit,  the  delegation  has  made  a
number of recommendations on the  kinds  of  strategies  we  can  employ  to
accelerate agricultural development in our own country.

South Africa should consider drawing up a widely consulted development  plan
along the  lines  of  the  Malaysian  Vision  2020  plan.  Such  an  overall
development plan could be supplemented by other  plans  for  development  in
the most significant sectors of agriculture, trade and industry.

The Department of Agriculture should investigate the possibility of  setting
up  agrotechnology  parks,  which  could  become  centres   in   which   the
entrepreneurial spirit of small farmers is developed with a  view  to  their
becoming commercial farmers. The parks would also be sites  where  technical
and financial assistance could  be  channelled  to  emerging  farmers  on  a
systematic basis.

The Department of Agriculture  should  adopt  the  strategy  of  encouraging
group farming activities to ensure the  pooling  of  resources  by  emerging
farmers. This would enable them to benefit from  economies  of  scale  which
will smooth their transition to commercial farming. Technical assistance  in
the fields of management and marketing could also be supplied to  them  more
efficiently.

South Africa could emulate the  Malaysian  model  of  women's  groups.  This
would enable especially  rural  women  to  engage  in  economic  activities,
thereby increasing the income potential of  rural  families.  The  Malaysian
model of agrotourism should be further examined with a view to  implementing
a similar model in South Africa.  This  will  further  increase  the  income
potential of rural communities.

The development of aquaculture should be seriously considered  with  a  view
to solving the problem of our diminishing marine  resources,  which  results
in our fishing communities being left  without  fishing  rights.  Fish  from
this source would also  be  a  cheap  supplementary  source  of  protein  to
bolster our food stock. South Africa  should  also  take  advantage  of  the
assistance offered by the Malyasian Technical Co-operation Programme in  the
field of human resource development.

In conclusion, Malaysia is a progressive developing nation with huge  dreams
for  the  future.  South  Africa  has  much  to  learn  from  this  country,
especially in the field of economic planning, and from their strategies  for
the development  and  unlocking  of  the  entrepreneurial  spirit  of  their
people. There is also much room for co-operation between  South  Africa  and
Malaysia in the technical field, especially with respect to aquaculture.

Tlogatloga e  tloga  gale,  modisa  kgomo  o  tswa  natso  sakeng.  Kodumela

(Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[People must make preparations in good  time.  Success  comes  through  hard
work. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Order!  That  concludes  the  debate  on  this
particular report. Only the chairperson of the committee indicated  that  he
wished to address the House.

The report was presented as a report to be  considered.  Given  the  various
aspects that impinge on executive action and that make policy proposals,  it
is the view of the Chair that this  report  should  not  be  voted  upon  as
though it has been considered in the manner  in  which  we  agree,  in  this
instance, that this particular economic and other  policy  the  House  would
adopt to direct the executive to execute. In my view this would move  beyond
the ambit of the House.

I therefore would suggest that  it  be  agreed  that  the  report  has  been
presented and noted and that should  the  committee  wish  to  make  further
examination with respect to policy and recommendations, it could  then  come
back to the House to decide on matters  that  we  would  wish  to  agree  we
pursue by way of decision of the House.

We therefore will not proceed to ask provinces  to  indicate  a  mandate  by
voting at this time. We note the report and thank the committee, one of  the
few committees that has submitted a report on an international visit. So  we
appreciate that work. It adheres to  the  kind  of  standard  we  have  been
asking for.

Report noted.

The Council adjourned at 16:27.
