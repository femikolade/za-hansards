                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms J MOLOI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on  the  next  sitting  day  I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a female prisoner at Bethel Prison was  forced  to  deliver  her
           baby within prison walls, whilst paramedics waited  outside  the
           prison gates; and


       (b)  the security guard who should have been on duty  at  the  prison
           gates was asleep when emergency services  arrived  to  help  the
           female inmate;


  (2) believes that this incident reflects challenges  that  every  patriot
       faces in building a caring society that  caters  for  the  rights  of
       women;


  (3) further notes that the African National Congress regrets the lack  of
       prompt and timeous action by  the  officials  in  the  Department  of
       Correctional Services, which led to the female prisoner giving  birth
       with the assistance of inexperienced and untrained staff; and


  (4) calls on the  department  to  expedite  the  investigation  into  the
       allegation that a security officer was asleep whilst  on  duty,  thus
       putting the lives of the mother and the baby at risk.

[Applause.]

Mr A J BOTHA: Hon Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting  I
shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) deplores -


       (a)  the arrests of ordinary farmers, including that of Crawford  von
           Abo, a prominent  South  African,  while  visiting  Zimbabwe  to
           attend to the needs of his staff there; and


       (b)  the ongoing silence of  the  South  African  President  and  his
           Government on what amounts to ethnic cleansing in Zimbabwe;


  (2) reminds the ANC that State theft of land was theft when it  was  done
       under the National Party, and remains theft in Zimbabwe under  Robert
       Mugabe, despite what his laws may say; and


  (3) urges South Africa to follow the lead of many governments which  have
       successfully intervened on behalf  of  their  citizens  in  Zimbabwe,
       whereas our Government has failed to do so.

[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that on Friday the  CEO  of  Spoornet,  Zandile  Jakavula,  was
       dismissed by Transnet for, amongst other things,  failing  to  accept
       demotion as punishment for corporate irregularities at Spoornet;


  (2) notes with appreciation the strong stance taken by Transnet  and  its
       subsidiary, Spoornet, in rooting out  corruption  amongst  employees;
       and


  (3) calls on the Government and all  parastatal  organisations  to  fight
       corruption with all the means at their disposal.

Ms H F MALEBANA: Madam Speaker I give notice that on the next sitting day  I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of Labour, the hon Membathisi Mdladlana,  has
       set a minimum wage of R650,00 for domestic workers in rural areas and
       R800,00 in urban areas;


  (2) further notes that the new  legislative  measures  announced  by  the
       Minister also include -


       (a)  consideration of the availability of transport for the employees
           who have to work night shifts; and


       (b)  that  the  employees  will  be  entitled  to  annual  leave  and
           maternity leave;


  (3) believes that his reflects the commitment of the  ANC-led  Government
       to -


       (a)  introduce legislative measures to protect  the  most  vulnerable
           workers; and


       (b)  further improve the quality of life of workers through extending
           basic conditions of work to include domestic workers; and


  (4) commends the Minister of Labour, the hon  Membathisi  Mdladlana,  for
       introducing new regulations which will protect domestic workers.

Mr A Z A JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice  that  at  the  next
sitting I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that a well-known South African  farmer,  Crawford
       von Abo, who has extensive farming interests, and his manager, Willem
       Klopper, were arrested on his farm in Zimbabwe;


  (2) further notes that Von Abo's arrest is  a  direct  violation  of  the
       bilateral agreement between South Africa and Zimbabwe, which  clearly
       guarantees  the  protection  of  South  African-owned  property   and
       investments in Zimbabwe: This  agreement  was  once  again  confirmed
       during recent discussions between the South African High Commissioner
       to Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwean Principal of Lands;


  (3) calls on the South African Government and  the  Minister  of  Foreign
       Affairs to immediately enter into negotiations  with  the  Zimbabwean
       government to -


       (a)  release Mr Von Abo and Mr Klopper; and


       (b)   reaffirm  the  protection  of  South   African   property   and
           investments in Zimbabwe in terms of the bilateral agreement.

[Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at the next  sitting  I  shall
move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the unabated continuance of farmer  evictions  and  arrests  in
       Zimbabwe, including amongst others, the arrest of Crawford von Abo, a
       Free State farmer also farming in Zimbabwe,  where  over  a  thousand
       people are in his employ;


  (2) further notes that agriculture remains a pivotal sector in  the  SADC
       economy, also in respect of food security;


  (3) acknowledges that HDIs must have accelerated access to  land  and  be
       developed as viable role-players in the agricultural sector;


  (4) notes with appreciation the efforts of Government  in  attempting  to
       secure the release of arrested South Africans in Zimbabwe; and


  (5) calls upon our President, as AU Leader to -
       (a)  persuade Zimbabwe to halt evictions and arrests; and


       (b)  convene a summit  of  SADC  governments,  farmers  and  interest
           groups to map out a sustainable action  plan  for  land  reform,
           which will promote emerging farmer settlement, the sustenance of
           agricultural production, and mentoring by  existing  farmers  of
           all new entrants.

[Applause.]

Miss J E SOSIBO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day
I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Ms Phumza Makhanya-Ojowuro  was  appointed  as  Provincial
       Head: Legal Services to the SA Police Service in KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) further notes that female officers have played an important  role  in
       bringing down the level of crime and  violence,  yet  they  were  not
       always visible at leadership levels of the SAPS;


  (3) believes that this represents our Government's commitment  to  gender
       equality and women's empowerment; and


  (4)  congratulates  Commissioner  Phumza  Makhanya-Ojowuro  on  her   new
       appointment.

Malibongwe! [Praise the name of women!] [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mev die Speaker, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek namens  die  VF
op die volgende vergadering van die Huis sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat  wat  tans  in  Zimbabwe  met  boere  gebeur,
       diefstal, korrupsie, nepotisme en rassisme is;


  (2) verder daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die meeste boere se grond van hulle  af  weggeneem  word  sonder
           enige kompensasie - dit is diefstal;


       (b)  slegs blanke boere se grond afgeneem word - dit is rassisme; en


       (c)  van die boere se grond aan bekende Mugabe-vriende gegee  word  -
           dit is korrupsie en nepotisme;


  (3) kennis neem dat die Vryheidsfront van mening is dat  president  Mbeki
       en die Suid-Afrikaanse regering president Mugabe nou in die  openbaar
       moet kritiseer oor die wyse waarop teen kommersiële boere in Zimbabwe
       opgetree word; en


  (4) verder kennis neem dat die Vryheidsfront 'n uitdaging  aan  president
       Mbeki rig om wit boere van Zimbabwe uit te nooi om na Suid-Afrika  te
       kom,  waar  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  Regering  landbougrond  aan   hulle
       beskikbaar sal stel om sodoende aan die wêreld te toon  dat  daar  in
       Suid-Afrika vir wit en swart boere plek is om voedsel in  belang  van
       die land te produseer.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  at  the  next
meeting of the House I will move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that what currently is happening  to  farmers  in  Zimbabwe  is
       theft, corruption, nepotism and racism;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  most farmers' land is being taken away  from  them  without  any
           compensation - that is theft;


       (b)  only white farmers' land is being taken away - that  is  racism;
           and


       (c)  some of the farmers' land is being given to  known   friends  of
           Mugabe - that is corruption and nepotism;


  (3) notes that it is the opinion of  the  Freedom  Front  that  President
       Mbeki and the South African Government should now publicly  criticise
       President Mugabe for the  manner  in  which  steps  are  being  taken
       against commercial farmers in Zimbabwe; and


  (4) further notes that the Freedom Front issues a challenge to  President
       Mbeki to invite white farmers from Zimbabwe to come to South  Africa,
       where the South  African  Government  would  make  agricultural  land
       available to them in order to demonstrate to the world that in  South
       Africa there is room for both white and black farmers to produce food
       in the interests of the country.]

Mr P J NEFHOLOVODWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice on behalf of  Azapo
that at the next sitting of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Fhulufhelani Netshitungulu,  the  11-year-old  girl  from  Venda
           whose disfigured  face  was  operated  on,  is  reported  to  be
           recovering well;


       (b)  her plight was highlighted  by  talkshow  host  Felicia  Mabuza-
           Suttle, who invited surgeons to offer  their  services  free  of
           charge; and


       (c)  Arwyp Hospital in Kempton Park sponsored the operation, while Dr
           Hennie Roos and Dr Mike Bouckaert offered their services free of
           charge;


  (2) congratulates the two doctors, as well  as  the  hospital  staff  and
       management for their spirit of ubuntu; and

       speedy recovery and with all our hearts we say: ``Kha hule a fane  na
       ndou.'' [May she grow and grow.]

Dr I M CACHALIA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at  the  next  sitting  I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:

           nonracial, nonsexist and democratic South Africa; and

           formulation of the Freedom Charter at the Congress of the People
           in 1955 in Kliptown;


  (2) believes that Comrade Helen Joseph was one of the pioneers and played
       an important role in building a nonracial mass movement in the 1950's
       and served as an inspiration to future generations of  anti-apartheid
       activists;

       leaders who have carried the torch of freedom during the dark days of

       veteran of the struggle; and


  (5) vows to work towards the realisation of the progressive  ideals  that
       she lived for.

Wathint' abafazi! Wathint' imbokodo! [You strike the  women,  you  strike  a
rock.] [Applause.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting I shall move:

  (1) expresses the hope that the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development
       will pay attention to -


       (a)  the whole question of land redistribution; and

           the impact of the Zimbabwean tragedy on Southern Africa;

       partly as a result of disastrous policies and  governmental  failures

       the attention which South Africa's interests demand.

[Applause.]

House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 235 police  stations  around  South  Africa  require  door
       locks;


  (2) urges the Minister of Safety and Security to address the  problem  of
       faulty locks in cell blocks  and  the  absence  of  locks  on  police
       station doors with the utmost urgency; and


  (3) acknowledges that conditions at police stations  around  the  country
       are  not  optimal  for  securing  arrested  persons,   awaiting-trial
       prisoners and other alleged criminals.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, there are once more lots of  private  meetings  in
this House. Could we please heed what is going on in the Assembly.

Mr B M SONO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  during recess  Members  of  Parliament  participated  in  public
           dialogues in Kimberley on legislation relating to children;


       (b)  these events provided members of the public with the opportunity
           to interact with legislators in a direct manner;


       (c)  they also allowed for Members of Parliament to hear the concerns
           of individuals and organisations providing services to children;
           and


       (d)  a draft Children's Bill has since been handed to the Minister of
           Social Development;


  (2) commends the work done by the Members of Parliament  who  held  these
       public dialogues, as these dialogues contribute to ongoing efforts to
       ensure that public representatives are accountable to the people; and


  (3) calls on the Minister of Social Development, the hon  Zola  Skweyiya,
       to ensure that  legislation  in  this  regard  is  finalised  at  the
       beginning of the 2003 parliamentary sitting.

[Applause.]

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE: Mev  die  Speaker,  ek  gee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting van die Huis namens die Nuwe NP gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  'n interministeriële veiligheidskomitee grensboere  gaan  besoek
           oor algemene plaasveiligheid;


       (b)  hierdie besoek in ooreenstemming is met 'n gesprek wat die  Nuwe
           NP drie weke gelede met Minister Lekota gehad het oor toenemende
           oorgrensveediefstal nadat die Weermag aan grense onttrek is; en


       (c)  die Minister onderneem het om -


           (i)    'n   gespreksmeganisme   tussen   die   Departement   van
                  Verdediging, Departement van Veiligheid en  Sekuriteit  en
                  Agri-SA in te stel wat grensprobleme sal hanteer;


           (ii)  groter weermagteenwoordigheid te  verseker  tydens  sekere
                  tye van die jaar wanneer veediefstal meer voorkom; en


           (iii) 'n besoek aan die grense te reël ter voorbereiding van  'n
                  ontmoeting met Lesotho se  ministers  van  verdediging  en
                  van veiligheid en sekuriteit; en


  (2) glo dat hierdie ondernemings nog 'n bewys is van die sukses  wat  die
       Nuwe NP in sy konstruktiewe samewerkingsooreenkoms met die ANC het.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice on behalf of  the
New NP that I shall move on the next sitting day of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  an interministerial safety committee  will  be  visiting  border
           farmers regarding general farm safety;


       (b)  this visit is in keeping with talks held three weeks ago between
           the New NP and  Minister  Lekota  about  increased  cross-border
           stock theft since the  Defence  Force  was  withdrawn  from  the
           borders; and


       (c)  the Minister has undertaken to -


           (i)   establish a dialogue mechanism between the  Department  of
                  Defence, the Department of Safety and Security  and  Agri-
                  SA which will address border issues;


           (ii)  ensure greater Defence Force presence at certain times  of
                  the year when stock theft is more prevalent; and


           (iii) arrange a visit  to  the  borders  in  preparation  for  a
                  meeting with Lesotho's Ministers of Defence and of  Safety
                  and Security; and


  (2) believes that these undertakings are more proof of the success  which
       the New NP is achieving in its  constructive  co-operation  agreement
       with the ANC.

[Applause.]]

           PEACE, DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPERITY: THE AFRICAN CENTURY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr D J SITHOLE: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers and  hon  members,  achievement
of peace on the African continent has been and is still a central  objective
of the leaders and the people of the continent. In 1963 the leaders  of  the
continent met and formed the OAU. In 2002 they again came together  to  form
the African Union. This effort is in pursuit of unity of the African  people
and the continent.

It is through peace and development that we will achieve our  desire  for  a
better life, free from bondage and poverty.

Nepad's  objective  of  good  governance  and  better  utilisation  of   our
resources is an indication that we had not struggled to enrich  a  few.  The
struggle was to provide a better and prosperous future for our people.

The freedom struggle is going on for economic emancipation and the  ultimate
defeat of poverty. Whilst these  are  noble  objectives  to  work  for,  we,
however, have to acknowledge that the road ahead is and will not be an  easy
one. When we fought for our political freedom, it  was  not  easy.  We  lost
gallant fighters who were not prepared to  submit,  but  were  committed  to
fight the continued subjugation and oppression of our people.

They laid down their lives for me and hon members to enjoy this freedom.  We
dare not fail them. We should not despair because of  what  seems  to  be  a
difficult road ahead. It is only through unity of our  people  that  we  can
take our destiny into our hands.

Nepad will not be  a  panacea  for  all  Africa's  problems,  but  it  is  a
strategic intervention to confront not only our economic problems, but  also
to challenge the undemocratic and dictatorial  regimes  that  exist  on  the
continent. It does not  help  to  complain  about  the  existence  of  these
regimes. It is true that those who want to portray themselves as  democratic
today, at one time held such regimes in high esteem.

The former US President Ronald Reagan, when receiving Savimbi at  the  White
House in 1986, gave him the red carpet treatment.  He  was  treated  like  a
head of state and hailed as  a  freedom  fighter.  He  was  portrayed  as  a
combatant by apartheid South Africa and other Western powers.  It  is  those
who supported and assisted Mobutu Seseseko who looted the Congo,  who  today
want to prescribe what democracy is.

Plagued by proxy wars, the road to peace, freedom and  prosperity  will  not
be an easy one. African leaders have recognised that  democracy,  peace  and
development are the prerequisites for the creation of a better life.  It  is
good governance, respect for human rights and the  rule  of  law  that  will
bring stability and create the environment conducive to development.

We fought for this democracy, and we must defend it. In defending  democracy
we must oppose and  defeat  ethnic  chauvinism,  religious  intolerance  and
racial arrogance;  intensify  our  fight  against  poverty,  illiteracy  and
ignorance; distribute the continent's wealth to  all  who  live  on  it  and
share the scarce resources among all the people of the continent.

It  was  African  leaders  who   denounced   unconstitutional   changes   of
government, and who expressed a commitment to rebuild states centred on  the
people and guided by the needs of the people. Our  commitment  to  create  a
society  in  which  human  rights  are  jealousy  guarded  will  unlock  the
potential and initiative of our people.

Yes, our challenge is enormous, but Nepad is bound to succeed as it is  born
out of African nations themselves on the realisation of the need to  respond
to their developmental challenges. The creation of  the  Council  for  Peace
and Security  is  a  major  step  forward.  It  therefore  rests  with  this
Parliament to expedite the  rectification  of  the  protocol  creating  this
organ. This council will assist  in  making  interventions  to  prevent  and
resolve conflicts.

It is our view that sustainable development and peace are two sides  of  the
same  coin.  It  is  through  peace  that  we   will   achieve   sustainable
development, and it is through sustainable  development  that  we  will  see
peace. To  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development, we need to ensure  that  the  developed  nations  assume  their
share of responsibility. The war on terrorism cannot  be  a  substitute  for
measures to protect the earth  and  its  people  from  the  consequences  of
global warming and climate change.

It was African leaders  who  set  themselves  goals  and  objectives  to  be
achieved through Nepad. It was African leaders who pronounced  the  need  to
respect the rule of law. It  was  African  leaders  who  condemned  military
coups d'etat against democratically  elected  governments.  It  was  African
leaders who saw the centrality of the masses in the transformation.  It  was
African leaders who saw the critical role to  be  played  by  a  Pan-African
Parliament as a public forum for accountability.
The African century is the century full of hope and hard work. We  will  not
succeed if some of our brothers see themselves  as  representatives  of  the
interests of our former colonial masters. The  African  century  is  nothing
but the African taking her own future into her own hands.

Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker, the inaugural summit of the African Union  held
in Durban last month has come and gone. South Africa  as  the  host  country
can be pleased with a job well done.

Congratulations are due to hon President Mbeki, not  only  for  his  skilful
induction as the first Chairperson of the AU, but also for the  skilful  way
in which he steered the summit  through  its  proceedings  to  a  successful
conclusion.

Thanks are due to the Department of Foreign Affairs, which  was  responsible
for the arrangements  and  logistics,  as  well  as  the  officials  of  the
municipal, provincial and  national  spheres  of  government,  all  of  whom
played their part in contributing to the success of the event.  However,  we
are now waiting for the bill of cost. And, I hope that this  will  not  take
the smile of satisfaction off the faces of South Africans!
Now that the AU and its development programme have been launched,  the  time
for words and rhetoric is over. The time for deeds and actions has  arrived.
Parliament can pass as many fine-sounding resolutions as it  wishes  to;  we
can indulge in self-congratulation, but these will count for nothing  unless
we, the people of Africa, start delivering on the commitments  made  for  us
by our leaders and ratified by our parliaments.

Taken together, the AU and Nepad constitute the most  promising  development
to come from Africa in the post-colonial era. They hold up the  prospect  of
a future for the peoples of our continent. However, success cannot be  taken
for granted. It is not going to come easily.  It  will  require  commitment,
hard work, bold and creative leadership. It would  involve  tough  decisions
and focused policies.

Each one of us in civil society will have  to  cast  off  the  psychosis  of
dependency and entitlement, and instead embrace the spirit of  self-reliance
and self-fulfilment. The rewards of success may be many, but so too will  be
the consequences of failure.

The stakes  are  high.  The  developmental  goals  set  by  Nepad  are  very
ambitious. To mention  just  a  few:  by  the  year  2015  all  children  of
schoolgoing age in Africa should be enrolled in primary schools; the  infant
and child mortality rate reduced two-thirds;  the  maternal  mortality  rate
reduced  by  three-quarters;  by  2005  implement  national  strategies  for
sustainable development and achieve and sustain an  average  Gross  Domestic
Product growth rate of above 7% for the  next  15  years.  That  is  a  tall
order.

However, a unique opportunity presents  itself,  and  opportunities  do  not
last for ever. If we do not use this opportunity now, and  try  to  make  it
succeed as much as we  can,  Africa  will  languish  in  impoverishment  and
marginalisation for generations to come.

Where do we go from here to convert this wish list  that  is  before  us  in
this Parliament today, of peace, development  and  prosperity  and  turn  it
into  reality?  Firstly,  the  objectives  and  principles  of   the   basic
structural work of the AU have been put in place.  Now  it  needs  competent
and dedicated women and men to make it work. Of  course,  a  start  must  be
made with basic structures in order to enable the AU to function.
However, on the way forward, I suggest that priority be given,  firstly,  to
the Peace and Security Council; secondly, to the Peer Review  Mechanisms  on
Good Governance; thirdly, on  the  implementation  of  selected  development
programmes of Nepad to show, at least, that some progress has been  made  on
the ground; fourthly, the AU will require financial  resources  based  on  a
realistic budget of income and expenditure.

In a continent where poverty runs deep this will not  be  easy.  There  have
been disturbing reports that President Ghaddafi, who we  all  know  came  to
power through a military coup some 33 years ago, has been  using  his  money
power as part of a strategy in African politics. If these reports are  true,
it reveals an unhealthy state of affairs.

Recently, I came across this poster on a  shop  windows  on  a  neighbouring
country in the wake of Ghaddafi's passage  with  his  60-vehicle  entourage:
``Muammar Ghaddafi, architect of African Union''. Well, Ghaddafi  can  claim
that if he wishes to, but all I want to say is  that  I  hope  he  does  not
become the AU's paymaster.

I believe that Africa must start  making  real  progress  in  the  field  of
democracy, human rights, the rule of law and good  governance,  not  because
the developed world says that we must, but because we  know  in  our  hearts
that there will be no peace, security, safety or development unless we  have
these things.

Fourthly, it was the leaders of Africa who made the commitments and  pledges
on behalf of Africa.  They  must  demonstrate  that  they  meant  what  they
pledged. Each one of them who fails to honour the commitment that  he  made,
diminishes all of us in Africa.

However, world leaders must be shaking their heads in sad disbelief  to  see
the leader of a country just to the north of us making  a  mockery  of  this
collective  African  commitment  and,  in  the  process,  wrecking  a   once
flourishing agricultural industry while hundreds of thousands of his  people
face starvation and famine.

And, no doubt, the world leaders will shake their heads  even  further  when
they see other  African  leaders,  including  the  Chairperson  of  the  AU,
standing by silently while the very foundation of the AU and Nepad is  being
undermined.
I believe that the AU and Nepad can succeed, but it is not going to  succeed
just by talking or by self-congratulation. It  will  require  that  we,  the
people of Africa, roll up our sleeves and seize the opportunity  in  a  mood
of self-fulfilment. More than this, it will require  that  our  leaders,  by
their actions, demonstrate that they stand by their  commitments  that  they
made on behalf of Africa.

Yes, there can be  peace,  development  and  prosperity.  This  can  be  the
African century, but, as I said when I started,  the  time  for  talking  is
past. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, the hon Eglin says the  time  for  talking  is
over. I would like to begin by saying that the  time  for  waiting  is  also
over. Africa has triumphantly pronounced  that  this  century  will  be  the
African century. We have also undertaken through the AU and  the  organs  of
the AU that will soon be put into place to try and secure peace  to  achieve
development and confer prosperity on our continent.

Under normal circumstances this will be hard enough,  even  on  a  continent
that is well resourced. In the reality that is Africa this is  an  extremely
tall order. There is no leader in Africa who does not recognise this.  Every
leader knows too well the complexity and the enormity of the task.  Success,
however, is not impossible, and the  African  century  can  indeed  come  to
pass. The path to that success, though, is very steep.

First of all, we have to consider the health of our  planet.  Whilst  Africa
slumbered all these centuries, the Western world, Japan and  wherever  great
development has taken place, these countries have also taken  a  great  toll
on our planet. One hundred years ago, Victorian England spewed enough  smoke
from its belching chimneys to leave 100 kilogrammes of  carbon  in  the  air
for each man,  child  and  woman  living  then.  The  modern  Western  Japan
subsequently would get industrial output, and growth contributed one ton  of
carbon for each of the six billion people who inhabit the earth.

Hon colleagues, I would like members to consider for one  moment:  for  each
single person that lives on earth, there is one ton of carbon that  has  not
been disposed of in the atmosphere. Can members  imagine  what  will  happen
when China really gets going as an industrial nation, and imagine what  will
happen when Africa stokes up the fires of its own industries.

At present Africa contributes only 3% of the carbon  emission.  How  serious
is this problem? I think, and all members have witnessed the massive  floods
in China, India, Europe, America,  South  Africa  and  northern  Mozambique,
this indicates that the world climate is changing,  and  that  the  critical
mass towards the unravelling of the climates of  the  world  is  now  taking
place.

This is the backdrop against which we in Africa have to  attempt  to  create
growth and prosperity. The World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  will
have to make some very tough choices, otherwise we  are  witnessing  one  of
the four horsemen of the apocalypse. The massive floods in  these  countries
are not by pure chance; it is as a result of human intervention  that  these
massive floods are occurring.

The second horseman of the apocalypse is the  advancing  desert.  The  human
population, a mere 100 years ago, stood at just 1 billion. Today  China  and
India have populations of a billion each,  and  there  are  over  6  billion
people inhabiting the earth. This causes a demand on finite resources to  be
stretched to the point where the earth can no longer  sustain  this  demand.
Witness the depletion of the fish stocks in  the  North  Atlantic  Ocean  as
only one problem.

Here  in  South  Africa,  we  may  not  have  adequate  water  for  all  our
inhabitants in just 18 to 20 years. Now, here again we need  to  take  stock
of  how  this  continent  is  going  to  make  progress  towards  peace  and
prosperity when the finite resources of the world are drying up. It is  very
clear that we can no longer compromise on issues  of  the  environment;  the
dangers are both immense and  imminent.  The  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development must force countries to do what is necessary before  it  is  too
late.

There are political problems of equal magnitude that face us.  South  Africa
has been a miracle and a revelation by choosing  democracy,  pluralism,  co-
operation,  transparency,  accountability,   freedom   of   expression   and
assembly. Our country gave itself the greatest start that  any  country  has
ever had. For us to impact on the rest of the world  we  need  jealously  to
guard, as the hon Sithole said,  these  unparalleled  rights.  Our  airwaves
have to be free, so should  be  our  press.  Openness  is  a  non-negotiable
condition for progress. It would be a misguided notion to contain  criticism
and dissent. When that space to defer  is  gone,  dissent  becomes  violent,
goodwill vanishes and upheavals occur.

The economies of developing countries all over the world are in trouble.  We
are doing pretty well in South Africa in spite the trouble  all  around  us.
We are  succeeding  because  ours  is  an  open  society  where  people  may
criticise the government or even the president without  coming  to  personal
harm.  Our  judiciary  is  independent,  our  chapter  9  institutions   are
similarly  endowed.  Our  universities  are  also  enjoying  10   years   of
unimaginable freedom.  If  we  detract  from  any  of  these  freedoms  then
everything will be lost. South Africa is the hope of  Africa,  and  we  must
nurture the co-operation we have. We must strive for reconciliation  in  the
thick of rejection. The African century can only materialise if the  African
Renaissance blossoms, and arts and thought flourish.

For the renaissance that is underway, and let us make no mistake  about  it,
it is underway, we as parliamentarians  have  to  do  something  that  is  a
novelty in Africa. We as parliamentarians have to be seen to be holding  the
executive to account. Through fair and just  oversight  we  will  serve  not
only our country, but Africa itself. The Government has made  great  strides
and, like Macbeth, it should not compromise the honour it has,  as  well  as
remember the golden opinions that we have bought from all sorts  of  people,
which would be worn now in the newest gloss, not cast aside so soon.

The African century has to be built on the foundation  of  total  democracy.
We  have  the  guarantee  that  as  long  as  we  look  after  our  physical
environment and our political environment, we  will  be  able  to  make  the
impact that we are expected to. If we want to go  down  in  history  as  the
true champions of the continent, we have to encourage democracy  and  accept
fair criticism by having open meetings, as we are doing in  our  committees,
encourage public hearings, making this a people's parliament, ensuring  that
we, too,  are  fully  accountable  to  the  electorate.  We  laid  the  best
foundation for the African century.

As politicians we often forget that the greatest wisdom  lies  not  with  us
who sit in here, but with the  sovereign  people  who  send  us  here.  That
sovereignty is theirs and  theirs  alone,  that  they  have  the  right,  as
people, to govern themselves, as was promised in  the  Freedom  Charter.  As
lawmakers we must therefore uphold  all  these  freedoms  enshrined  in  the
Freedom Charter and ingrain them  so  much  into  our  practices  that  they
become a habit that we cannot break.

If, after 20 years, South Africa is still free, as it  is  now,  and  people
still engage each other in dialogue and if reconciliation is  achieved,  the
African century will indeed come to pass. For  Africa  to  achieve  what  it
wants to achieve, there is an enormous role  that  this  Parliament  has  to
play in ensuring that Africa indeed succeeds  in  its  objective  of  making
this the century of peace and prosperity. [Applause.]

Mrs M M MALUMISE: Madam Speaker, allow me to quote from what  the  President
once said. He said:


  There exists within our continent a generation which has been  victim  to
  all the things which created  Africa's  negative  past.  This  generation
  remains African and carries with it an historic pride which compels it to
  seek a place for Africans equal  to  all  other  peoples  of  our  common
  universe.
He went on to say:


  This generation knows and is resolved that, to attain that objective,  it
  must resist all tyranny, oppose all attempts to deny liberty by resorting
  to demagogy, repulse the temptation  to  describe  African  life  as  the
  ability to live on charity, engage the fight to secure  the  emancipation
  of the African woman, and reassert the fundamental concept  that  we  are
  our own liberators from oppression, from  underdevelopment  and  poverty,
  from the perpetuation of an experience, from slavery to  colonialisation,
  to apartheid, to dependence on alms. It is this generation whose sense of
  rage guarantees Africa's advance towards its own renaissance.

It must, therefore, be remembered that in  the  history  of  the  people  of
Africa, the people's struggles against colonialism,  racism  and  apartheid,
women were at the forefront of those battles. They were at the forefront  of
the struggle for the emancipation of our society.

On the peace front, it is very interesting to note  that  most  of  the  war
zones or conflict areas are where we have huge deposits of minerals,  wealth
and natural assets. It is clear that the forces outside the  continent  have
vested interests ... Listen to this, hon members  ...  [Interjections.]  ...
in  creating  chaos,  conflicts,  anarchy,  monopoly  and  exploitation   of
Africa's  wealth,  hence  we  have  blood  diamonds  ...  Van   der   Merwe!
[Interjections.] [Laughter.] ... in exchange for arms, which  affects  women
and children negatively. Women are victims of rape. We should remember  that
Rwandan women were gang-raped, and they are now HIV-positive and  are  dying
together with their children.

Women have no choice but to work for peace and stability in order to  create
an environment that is conducive to our girl children  developing  to  their
full potential. It is important, therefore, to involve women to be  part  of
the peace  processes  on  the  continent  because,  firstly,  they  are  not
involved in the blood diamonds and arms trafficking. Secondly, we  have  not
heard of our women in the military staging  coups.  [Applause.]  Africa  has
been ravaged by war ever since its independence. Africa  has  never  enjoyed
peace. Africa never had an opportunity to sit  down  and  plan  for  itself,
because it is consistently engaged in talks on how to create peace.

In this time of war, women tend to concentrate on  domestic  issues,  caring
for the family, children and the  elderly;  caring  for  the  sick  and  the
injured. After the wars, because of the force used to  solve  problems,  men
tend to use violence even in solving family problems,  instead  of  engaging
their wives and children. South Africa  is  an  example  of  this  violence,
hence the  rape  of  women  and  children  that  we  experience  today.  The
apartheid state used violence  to  oppress  its  people.  Therefore,  people
thought that violence was the only method of solving problems.

Regarding development, because of wars, development in Africa  was  stifled.
The practice, internationally, in areas where there have been wars, is  that
when peace processes begin, international organisers  and  institutions,  in
their facilitation of peace talks, forget to  include  women.  There  is  no
home that can have peace and prosperity if women and  children  are  abused.
There can be no development without peace and stability. It  is,  therefore,
up to all of us in Africa to  seriously  commit  ourselves  to  working  for
peace and stability.

In this century, Africa has a bigger challenge  of  eradicating  illiteracy.
It is disempowering for women not to  be  able  to  read  and  write.  Madam
Speaker, you can imagine a woman of our age, you and I, whose secrets  in  a
letter are being read to her by a nine-year-old  or  twelve-year-old  child.
Where will our privacy be? Where will our  dignity  be?  This  is  the  area
where our girl children's problems and needs should be seriously  addressed.
Compulsory education should focus more on the girl child. As  members  know,
at the beginning of each year, in most of our countries, people move to  the
job markets to seek jobs. It is unfortunate that  the  girl  child  is  left
behind to take care of brothers and  sisters,  and  runs  the  home  in  the
absence of the mother. That is what is happening. Illiteracy gives  grounds,
or opens the way, for women's human rights not to be respected - the  rights
to privacy and dignity.

Regarding family issues, it  does  not  matter  whether  one  is  a  trained
teacher, nurse or social worker, one has, as a mother,  to  play  all  these
roles. The social welfare Setas should acknowledge all this prior  knowledge
and find ways to accredit and give short courses for women. The role  played
by women is enormous, whereas little is said or written about them.

Regarding health issues, it is true that our people  die  young  because  of
preventable diseases,  which  include  malaria,  TB,  respiratory  diseases,
Aids, cholera, cancer, one can name them and many others. Due to a  lack  of
basic needs in other areas, women  remain  behind  to  take  care  of  their
families and become victims themselves.

In conclusion, in this century - the  African  century  -  we  want  to  see
Africa putting basic needs  as  basic  rights.  Poverty  and  all  forms  of
violence should be eliminated. Finally, as the late O R Tambo once said:


  Our nationalities and social emancipation will never be  complete  if  we
  continue to treat the women of our  continent  as  dependent  minors  and
  objects of one form of exploitation or another.

[Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, the previous speaker referred to  her  age
and to that of the Speaker, but may I remind her that  the  hon  Speaker  is
still under 50.

Despite his huge contribution to the ultimate independence of Africa,  Kwame
Nkrumah had it wrong when he said: ``First seek the political  kingdom,  and
the rest will follow.'' What mostly emanated from the political kingdom  was
war, famine, poverty and corrupt rule. Being heavily under the influence  of
the Soviet Union at the time,  Nkrumah  should  have  instead  followed  the
advice of Karl Marx, who said: ``First seek the  economic  kingdom  and  the
rest will follow.'' I am sure the hon Minister Essop Pahad will  agree  with
me, although  he  no  longer  serves  on  the  executive  committee  of  the
Communist Party. [Laughter.]

The launch of the African Union  in  Durban  last  month  was  precisely  to
restore the economic kingdom  on  the  continent.  By  the  way,  the  great
brother leader Ghadaffi is not  the  architect  of  the  African  Union,  as
claimed by posters splashed all over South Africa and Swaziland,  and  shown
to the House by the hon Colin Eglin. President Thabo  Mbeki  is  undoubtedly
the architect of the African Union in  its  present  form,  which  is  light
years away from Ghadaffi's vision of a united states  of  Africa  under  one
supreme leader, and guess who that is supposed to be!

The African Union and its programme of action, Nepad, is Africa's last  hope
to propel peace, development and prosperity on the continent. The Peace  and
Security Council of the African Union, earmarked to become a very  important
organ of the  union,  will  play  an  important  role  in  promoting  peace,
security and stability in Africa.

The draft protocol relating  to  the  establishment  of  the  African  Union
acknowledges, and I quote:


  ... the fact that no single  internal  factor  has  contributed  more  to
  socioeconomic decline on the continent and the suffering of the  civilian
  population than the scourge of conflicts within and between states.

It is also important to note that the Assembly of  Heads  of  State  regards
democracy as an important mechanism to promote peace. The Assembly of  Heads
of State agreed in Durban that:


  ... regular elections constitute a key  element  of  the  democratisation
  process, and therefore are essential ingredients for good governance, the
  rule of law, the maintenance and promotion of peace, security,  stability
  and development.

The fact that democracy promotes peace is underpinned by the  fact  that  no
democratic state has ever declared  war  on  another  democratic  state.  It
must, however, be pointed out that the mere fact that elections are held  is
no guarantee for peace. Elections must be free and fair, otherwise  it  will
cause conflict.

Lesotho is a case in point where rigged elections a few  years  ago  led  to
civil war. In Zimbabwe tension is still running high  due  to  a  perception
that the elections were all but free and fair. Whilst  democratic  processes
play a crucial role in promoting peace, the root causes of conflict  on  the
continent will have to be addressed.

Disregard for minority rights  continues  to  be  one  of  the  most  common
sources of conflict in Africa. Africa must stop paying lip  service  to  the
content of their own bible,  the  African  Charter  on  Human  and  People's
Rights, and start implementing the provisions thereof in practice.

Once people belonging to minorities  have  the  right  to  enjoy  their  own
culture, to practise their own religion, and to use their own language,  the
conflicts will wither away until it finally stops. It is essential that  the
African Commission on Human and People's Rights  becomes  an  organ  of  the
African Union.

Die beëindiging van die burgeroorlog in Angola, en die vredesooreenkoms  wat
uiteindelik in die Demokratiese Republiek van die Kongo gesluit is, sal  die
weg baan vir 'n stabiele Suider-Afrikaanse streek  wat  die  enjinkamer  kan
word vir ekonomiese ontwikkeling op die vasteland.

President Mbeki se volgehoue pogings om vrede te bewerkstellig  in  die  DRK
kan nie hoog genoeg aangeslaan word nie.  Die  enigste  vrot  appel  in  die
mandjie op die oomblik is nog steeds Zimbabwe. Mugabe se brutale  onteiening
van kommersiële boere se grond, en sy verkragting  van  die  oppergesag  van
die wet, vervreem potensiële beleggers  en  is  niks  anders  as  ekonomiese
sabotasie teen die hele streek nie. Hoe gouer  hierdie  ekonomiese  saboteur
sy amp neerlê, hoe beter  vir  die  vooruitgang  van  die  Suider-Afrikaanse
streek. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[The ending of the civil war in Angola, and the  peace  agreement  that  was
finally concluded in the Democratic Republic of the  Congo,  will  pave  the
way for a stable Southern African region that could become the  engine  room
for economic development on the continent.

President Mbeki's continued efforts to bring about peace in the  DRC  cannot
be commended enough. The only rotten apple in the basket at  the  moment  is
still Zimbabwe. Mugabe's brutal expropriation of commercial  farmers'  land,
and his violation of the supremacy of  the  law,  are  alienating  potential
investors and are nothing short  of  economic  sabotage  against  the  whole
region. The sooner this economic saboteur steps down from his position,  the
better for the prosperity of the Southern African region.]

The arrest of a  prominent  South  African  farmer,  Crawford  von  Abo,  is
totally unacceptable and clearly violates the  bilateral  agreement  between
South Africa and Zimbabwe pertaining to the protection  of  investments.  We
urgently call on the South African Government to do everything in its  power
to facilitate the release of South African citizens  arrested  in  Zimbabwe,
and  to  safeguard  their  investments,  as  guaranteed  by  the   aforesaid
agreement.
The engine that will drive economic development on the  continent  in  order
to eradicate poverty and pave the way for prosperity is undoubtedly the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development. The underlying principle of  Nepad  is
that the developed world should invest in Africa and open their  markets  to
African products in return for adherence to democracy, good  governance  and
peace by African states.

Unfortunately, the decision by African  governments  to  nominate  Libya  to
chair the next United Nations  Commission  on  Human  Rights  poses  serious
questions about the commitment to human  rights  and  democratic  principles
which underpin both the Constitutive Act of the African Union and the  Nepad
document. Human Rights Watch correctly pointed out:


  Putting Libya forward as Africa's choice to lead the world's human rights
  forum should really ring alarm bells.

If  it  is  still  possible  for  the  African  Union  to   withdraw   their
recommendation, they should not hesitate to do so immediately.

Dit is 'n eenvoudige  waarheid.  Sonder  vrede  sal  daar  nooit  ekonomiese
ontwikkeling  op  die  vasteland  plaasvind  nie,   en   sonder   ekonomiese
ontwikkeling sal voorspoed en  vooruitgang  Afrika  bly  ontwyk.  [Applous.]
[This is a  simple  truth.  Without  peace  there  will  never  be  economic
development on the continent, and without economic  development,  prosperity
and progress will continue to evade Africa. [Applause.]]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Madam Speaker, peace and prosperity in the  African  century
will only come to Africa when the African Union and its  member  states  and
those currently outside the union accept the responsibility to  shape  their
own destiny and take the necessary initiatives to chart the  course  towards
the realisation of that destiny. This entails  acknowledging  the  realities
of African history. Africa's underdevelopment is  a  direct  consequence  of
the  continent's  colonial  and  imperial  history.  The  African   economic
potential  cannot  be  unlocked  without  correcting   historical   colonial
imbalances.

The economic relations which have given rise to  these  material  imbalances
have been handed down to today's generation  as  a  legacy  that  cannot  be
wished away by pretending and talking ourselves into believing that it  does
not  exist.  Nowadays,  the  African  governing  elites  have  developed   a
selective amnesia  which  makes  them  conveniently  forget  that  they  had
embarked on anti-colonial and anti-racist struggles in order to  change  the
socio-ecopolitical order that subjected millions of Africans  to  conditions
of poverty, disease, ignorance, destitution and servitude. Once  the  voters
of these destitute and illiterate millions put them in  power,  they  became
prolific and resourceful authors of economic policies  that  perpetuate  the
status quo, while jettisoning the philosophy  that  hitherto  had  been  the
bedrock of the revolutionary struggle - all in the  name  of  the  new  uni-
polar situation and globalisation.

It  is  important  to  remember  that  globalisation  began  with   colonial
conquest. Imperialism laid the foundations of a global  economy  with  deep-
rooted disparities between  the  north  and  the  south.  Modern  technology
merely accentuated and put the seal on a process that began centuries ago.

We cannot  improve  imperialism.  By  the  same  token  we  cannot  humanise
globalisation without dismantling the imperial edifice on which  it  stands.
The classical scholars understood and articulated  the  view  that  monopoly
capitalism by its very  nature  provides  surplus  capital  that  cannot  be
absorbed by the core economies because consumption does not correspond  more
closely  to  production.  Consequently  surplus  profit  is   exported   for
investment  in  the  peripheral  economies  of  the  client   states.   This
peripheral investment does not necessarily conform to  a  rational  economic
development plan that has been locally designed to meet domestic needs.

Paul Baran contends that surplus profit in the  periphery  is  not  utilised
for further development of the latter  economy,  but  is  siphoned  off  and
repatriated for development of the  core  metropolitan  overseas  economies,
hence the disparity in the levels of development between the  core  and  the
periphery.

The  advocates  of  Nepad  must  therefore  understand  that   the   African
millennium presupposes a radical shift in  the  economic  balance  of  power
between the north and the south. This cannot be  done  by  the  north  as  a
philanthropic  gesture.  Africans  themselves  must  take  charge  of  their
economies. They must take ownership and  control  of  their  raw  materials,
beneficiate them locally and expand and sustain  the  local  economic  base,
rather than be mere sources of cheap  raw  materials.  The  Government  must
intervene directly and provide infrastructure, create a favourable  material
environment for rapid development and transformation of  social  conditions.
Empowerment must be broad-based and filter down to the groundswell.  Amandla

Mr L ZITA: Madam Speaker  and  hon  members,  the  economic  development  of
Africa and the transformation of her economy in a manner that addresses  the
interests of the majority of her people, is  one  of  the  most  challenging
questions that face her.

This was the question  that  arrested  the  attention  of  Nkrumah,  Cabral,
Machel, Kaunda, Nyerere and Oliver Tambo. Without  the  resolution  of  this
question, one can say that the revival of our continent  will  seriously  be
at risk.

In today's debate we want  to  examine  the  role  and  place  of  trade  in
reinforcing the renaissance of the continent's economy. It  would,  however,
be remiss of us to look at trade outside of the economic structures  of  the
continent.

The  possibilities  and  gains  that  can  be  derived  from  trade  are  an
expression  of  the  levels  of  development,  particularly  the  extent  of
industrialisation. Most African countries, with  the  partial  exception  of
South  Africa  and  Egypt,  are  essentially  rural  economies.  Even  where
urbanisation exists, this is merely a conglomeration of centres  of  poverty
with nothing similar to urbanisation as we have  come  to  know  it  in  the
developed world. This is urbanisation without industrialisation.

Why is this the case? Africa's encounter with  modernity  and  modernisation
was imposed. We were dragged out of a tributary mode of production into  the
modern capitalist system through colonialism. The  result  of  this  violent
integration was that the economic system that emerged was not at the  behest
of the people of the continent. The people were  subordinated  to  an  alien
logic, a logic more informed by the needs of the  developed  world,  serving
both as a source of raw materials in the market for manufactured products.

This under-development created a  continent  dominated  by  agriculture  and
mining, with extremely  limited  beneficiation  and  value  addition.  As  a
result, there was no possibility for the  development  of  complementarities
that could underpin the evolution of a nationally  organic  and  autocentred
development capable of absorbing the rural sector.

This historical impotence is not just  an  expression  of  economic  factors
alone, important as these are. It is a reflection  of  the  complicated  and
incomplete class formation on the periphery of the world system.

Due to the limited profits of  primary  products  as  a  result  of  limited
domestic markets  and  changes  in  the  terms  of  trade  in  international
markets, there are limited savings to  catalyse  a  sustained  programme  of
import  substitution  and  subsequently  export-oriented  industrialisation.
This results in very shortsighted economic activity and  risk  aversion  for
long-term investments and,  therefore,  the  generalisation  of  merchandise
activity without productive investments.

Relatedly, the entrepreneurial classes in the developing world are not  well
formed. With limited profit margins and declining revenues, it is  difficult
for them to lead their  societies  on  a  project  of  development  that  is
sustainable. There is nothing in the modern  sector  to  redistribute.  This
constraint prevents them from winning the popular classes on  a  sustainable
alliance capable of creating a historic block  of  forces  that  can  lay  a
genuine foundation for  nation-building.  Thus,  the  continuing  threat  of
tribalism. Critically, therefore, in  the  development  of  a  strategy  for
economic development, is the need to define the class basis and alliance  to
drive the project of African reconstruction.

The weaknesses of the entrepreneurial and dominant  classes  in  Africa  are
partially the reason for the debt trap that the continent faces.  This  debt
has risen to such an extent that more than half of the  export  earnings  of
African states have to service the debt.

After World War I,  all  progressive  opinion,  including  that  of  Maynard
Keynes, felt that it was unacceptable, unjust and unsustainable for  Germany
to pay 7% of her foreign exchange to war debt, yet it is deemed  sustainable
for Tanzania to pay 60% of  her  foreign  exchange  to  debt.  Is  this  not
racism? It is clear that without the cancellation of the debt  there  is  no
prospect of any sustainable development.

These problems of industrial development  are  further  complicated  by  the
technological and structural transformations  in  the  capitalist  developed
centres, the evolution of  a  post-Fordist  and  post-industrial  capitalism
which grows with absorbing labour. The generalisation of this  system  at  a
global  level  will  further  exacerbate  the   already   high   levels   of
unemployment in the Third World. This is the  impasse  and  tragedy  of  the
economic system today.

Why trade? The question of the centrality of trade is due to the  fact  that
it is seen as a source of foreign exchange,  as  a  result  of  the  limited
domestic markets in most of Africa. The critical  role  of  trade  has  also
been displayed in the phenomenal development  of  East  Asia.  However,  the
reason why the so-called Asian tigers were able to make maximum  gains  from
trade was due to the diversity of the economic structure, leading  to  their
competitiveness in the export of manufactured goods. This economic  capacity
was a result of the role of the state in the economy  and  its  capacity  to
incentivise  and  discipline  capital.  More  useful,  in  the  East   Asian
experience, was the notion of shared  growth,  manifested,  amongst  others,
through a popular-based land reform programme.
In talking about trade in Africa, it  is  critical  that  we  emphasise  the
sustainability of that trade. It cannot just be trade based  on  the  export
of unprocessed goods. To the extent that it must,  over  time,  involve  the
export of manufactured goods, trade promotion has to be located  within  the
framework  of  the  elaboration  of  the  developmental  state  across   the
countries of the African continent.

The fact, however, is that at present in Africa we have  to  export  primary
products. Despite the fact that these products have no value addition for  a
variety of reasons, some of them are competitive. The problem is  that  this
competitive advantage is undermined by the global trade regime.

Despite the loud noise of liberalisation, trade between the  north  and  the
south is not free. Through the combined use of subsidies,  tariff  and  non-
tariff barriers,  the  developed  north  has  systematically  prevented  the
developing world from accessing northern markets to sell products  in  which
the south is competitive.

This inequity was partly due to the fact that the Third  World  and  Africa,
in particular, was ineffective in global trade negotiations. It  was  easier
for the developed world to manipulate and divide  the  African  bloc.  This,
however, is coming to an end.

For the first time there was a coherent  voice  from  the  continent,  which
ensured that in the most recent meeting of the WTO in Doha, the  declaration
embraced some of the key development concerns of the African  continent.  Of
course, this is just the beginning. The devil, as they say, will  always  be
in the detail.

More important for us to understand is that bringing justice  to  the  world
economic architecture is a medium to  long-term  initiative,  and  solutions
have to be found for the short term. The establishment of the African  Union
will ensure that  this  emerging  coherence  and  cohesion  of  the  African
continent is consolidated, so that the  continent  speaks  with  one  voice.
This will not be easy, but the proper foundation is being laid.

It is clear that the challenge of economic transformation in  Africa  cannot
be reduced to trade alone, even though trade is important. There is  a  need
to address other questions. We need to  define  the  class  content  of  the
African transformation project. It cannot just  be  an  elitist  modernising
project at the expense of the people. There is a role  for  the  elite,  but
there is also a critical role for working people.

The political economy for the  African  Renaissance  must  be  a  multiclass
project in which the capitalist, statist and  socialist  tendencies  combine
and conflict. Such a political economy is one that is  most  suited  to  the
economic and social structures of the continent.

A  fundamental  feature  of  such  a  project  has  to  be  the  pursuit  of
fundamental land and agrarian reform, cognisant of the  fact  that  we  are,
for the foreseeable future, dealing essentially with rural-based  societies.
Undergirding such a project should be a developmental state.

Market  forces,  on  their  own,  have  failed  to   lead   to   sustainable
industrialisation. An effective, flexible and strong developmental state  is
critical to mobilise the necessary  resources  and  energies  to  facilitate
accumulation and transformation.

The emerging post-industrial framework within which the African  rebirth  is
taking place has interesting possibilities for  rural-based  societies.  The
new technologies in the form of micro-electronics,  nanotechnology  and  the
microform in which they appear, are  most  adequate  for  use  in  villages.
Maybe Africa will modernise without urbanisation.

This is one of the fundamental questions that have to be  posed  and  solved
as we pursue the dream of an African Renaissance. [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, the time for looting  natural  resources  for
personal gain on the continent is over. The challenges of the African  Union
are external, as well as self-inflicted.

Externally, the legacy of colonialism  is  still  a  problem  in  that  some
foreign colonial states still want to exercise exclusive control over  their
former colonies. Their motive for this is,  of  course,  the  plundering  of
resources. This factor is a  major  contributor  to  the  ongoing  conflicts
within the African Union.

However, some African heads of  state  themselves  are  the  problem.  These
leaders are overtaken by greed. They have become filthy rich at the  expense
of their own citizens. Democracy and good governance are the  only  antidote
if the African Union is to prosper.

I repeat what the hon Jordaan of the ANC has said.  He  said  that  we  must
promote good governance, not because of the imperatives put  on  us  by  the
Western world, but because of its intrinsic value. Only good governance  and
democracy will ensure even and fair distribution of resources in the  member
states of the African Union. In order to prosper, the AU must  mobilise  the
existing resources in an efficient and co-ordinated  manner  before  outside
help is sought.  There  are  enough  human  and  natural  resources  on  the
continent, and therefore there is no need for Africans to go around  begging
for aid.

An inclusive political process will ensure everlasting democracy  and  peace
on the continent. Some rebel factions on the continent exist as a result  of
exclusion from the political process. There are  national  constitutions  on
the continent which limit political participation. The AU must  ensure  that
an all-inclusive democracy is promoted. South Africa, as the  current  chair
of the AU, has a wonderful opportunity to promote these ideals.

Kambe ke zona iinkokeli ezingamasela  nezibe  imali  mazivalelwe.  Imali  le
ziyibileyo mayihluthwe inikwe abantu. Ukuba  imbumba  yama-Afrika  ikhuthaza
ukubanjwa kwala masela nezi nkokeli, ubusela buza  kutsho  buphele  nendlala
ife fi. [Of course, leaders who are thieves, who have stolen money, must  be
incarcerated. The money they have stolen must be seized  and  given  to  the
people. If the African Union encourages the  arrest  of  these  thieves  and
leaders, theft will end and poverty will be eradicated completely.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, I cannot remember  how  many  times  I  have
spoken from this podium about my dreams for Africa. I recently did so  again
during the hon President Mbeki's debate here. I  cannot  remember  how  many
times I have spoken from this podium, telling my supporters  and  all  other
Afrikaners that if Africa fails, we all fail with it. If  this  ship  sinks,
we sink with it.

In that sense I had planned to speak about my dreams for Africa  today,  but
there is no way I am going to speak about them as long as there  is  a  very
serious situation unfolding in Zimbabwe. I have changed  my  speech  because
of that - a situation that repudiates  everything  I  have  said  from  this
podium about the place of Afrikaners and of white people in  Africa,  making
a contribution and playing a role.

The first question I must answer every evening at  my  public  meetings  is:
Will the Zimbabwean situation repeat itself in South  Africa?  What  must  I
tell them? I tell them what I think, but I am  not  willing  to  lie  to  my
people. If the same is going to happen here, we need to know about  it  now.
We will not leave Africa; we will  just  plan  differently.  Those  are  the
realities.

In Zimbabwe it was first said that only the farms of  farmers  with  British
citizenship or dual citizenship would be part of the land  reforms.  At  the
moment the farms of farmers who have only Zimbabwean citizenship  are  being
taken. Then it was argued that only the farms of farmers with more than  one
farm would be taken. At  the  moment  there  are  several  farmers  in  jail
because they did not want to leave the one and only farm they had.
Several farmers spent the night in jail after being brutally injured by  the
Zimbabwean police. Is that how I must try to understand African  ubuntu,  as
it was explained to me? An old lady of 72 had to spend the night in  a  cell
without blankets or any facilities. A farmer of 80 slept on  cement  in  the
same cells.

Ek wil agb lede vra of die Raad saamstem met wat in Zimbabwe  gebeur.  Steun
agb lede dit? Ons moet dit weet en hulle moet dit vir ons sê, want hulle  is
op die oomblik doodstil. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I am  asking  hon  members  whether  this  Assembly  agrees  with  what  is
happening in Zimbabwe. Do hon members support this? We  have  to  know  this
and they must tell us, because right now they are dead quiet.]

Meanwhile, the Mugabe elite are busy on the farms. The provincial  governor,
Peter Chenetza, well known to the ANC exiles when he was  head  of  Mugabe's
protocol, is nick-named ``Five-farms''  Chenetza.  A  cabinet  Minister  and
head of the land task force, Ignatius Chombo, cannot  decide  which  one  of
three farms near Rafingora he wants. Do hon  members  agree  with  this?  Is
this correct? Is this the Africa I am dreaming of? We need to hear from  hon
members.

Hierdie  middag  het  ons  'n  vraag.  Zimbabwe  se  boere  word  genooi  na
Mosambiek. Hulle word tans genooi na Botswana om daar te gaan boer en  mense
lewend te hou. Gaan hulle ook na Suid-Afrika genooi kan word? Is  hier  plek
vir daardie boere, onthou dit is wit boere, om hier te kom boer?  Kan  hulle
hier grond kry? Kan hulle hier 'n bydrae maak? Is Suid-Afrika  'n  plek  vir
wit en vir swart,  of  is  dit  nie  so  nie?  Ons  moet  dit  vandag  weet.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[We have a question this afternoon. Zimbabwe's farmers are being invited  to
Mozambique. They are now also being invited to Botswana  in  order  to  farm
there and keep people alive. Will they also be invited to South  Africa?  Is
there room for these farmers, remember they are white farmers, to  come  and
farm here? Can they obtain land here? Can they make a contribution here?  Is
South Africa a place for white and for black, or is it not? We have to  know
this today.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO:  Madam  Speaker,  much  has  been  said  about  the  AU
formation in terms of what this institution is expected to achieve. Now  the
time has come for the AU to deliver. Although still new and busy setting  up
administrative capacities, the reality is the AU's  practical  programme  of
action, which will by and large  determine  the  differences  in  addressing
substantively issues of peace, development and prosperity on the  continent.
The attainment of these issues should be used as a yardstick to measure  the
progress of the AU. The problems faced by AU member states are immense,  but
not insurmountable.

Africa is for  the  first  time  in  years  of  oppression  and  imperialism
experiencing relative peace  and  democracy,  but  not  accompanied  by  any
meaningful development. Therefore, Africa's development is a pipe-dream  for
now unless we accelerate peace  processes  currently  in  motion  in  member
states such as the  DRC,  and  the  implementation  of  poverty  eradication
programmes,  debt  management,  trade  relations  and   government's   anti-
corruption campaigns.

We all know that the African  wars  were  to  a  certain  extent  externally
fuelled and  funded  by  some  developing  countries  to  pursue  their  own
objectives, economically and politically. However,  we  cannot  continue  to
blame others for the greed and lust for power by our own African people  who
benefit from these wars and, as a result, once in  power  fleece  government
resources for themselves and their families while the majority  are  exposed
to poverty.

The AU should, as a matter of urgency, establish a force that will not  only
observe, but also act decisively when the violation of  human  rights  takes
place and innocent people are killed, as  has  happened  in  Rwanda  in  the
past. The AU should in a way create conditions in which African people  will
feel secure on their own continent.

Because of wars and instability, Africans are scattered all over the  globe.
We are losing much-needed expertise from our professionals who are based  in
other countries. The AU must at all costs pursue the achievement  of  peace.
The  reality  is  that  development  cannot  take  root   in   an   unstable
environment.

The AU must also, in its programme of action,  continue  to  fight  for  the
total scrapping of the debt that contributes to underdevelopment  of  member
states. It is also not a secret that the major contributory  factor  is  the
unequal trade relations between the developed and developing countries  that
contribute to the  high  level  of  unemployment  and  currency  devaluation
leading to poverty.

The AU will  have  to  advance  the  African  agenda,  being  aware  of  the
socioeconomic and political situation of the member in the quest for  peace,
development and a prosperous society.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, most African societies have always held  that
peace is the mother of prosperity and  that  there  can  be  no  sustainable
economic development without peace. That is why some of them have  as  their
national motto: Kgotso ke nala. Peace begets prosperity.

Africa has immense wealth. Almost every mineral is found in  Africa.  Almost
every agricultural product can be grown in Africa.  In  actual  fact,  other
parts of the world, such  as  Europe  and  America,  owe  their  wealth  and
development to Africa. Although this is unpalatable today, the truth of  the
matter is that Africa was underdeveloped by Europe and America  through  the
trans-Atlantic slave trade and through European colonialism which  used  the
wealth  of  Africa,  but  not  for  Africans.  For  meaningful   sustainable
development in Africa, to eradicate poverty, hunger, ignorance and  disease,
the following must be done:

Africa's so-called foreign  debts  must  be  cancelled  immediately.  Former
colonial countries and dealers in the sale of human beings must  acknowledge
that   they   owe   Africa   an   enormous   debt   for   this   continent's
underdevelopment. The debt owed to the people of Africa  in  reparations  is
trillions of dollars compared to the debt claimed against Africa.

Africa must stop exporting her raw materials and importing  them  back  here
at exorbitant prices. Africa must maximise the study of modern  science  and
technology in all her institutions of learning so that Africa's  people  can
acquire the technology to capacitate her to process her raw  materials  here
and export them as finished products.

African epistemology in all spheres  of  life  must  be  revived.  Too  much
indigenous  knowledge  has   been   discarded   under   the   influence   of
Westernisation. Africa can advance technologically without losing her  soul.
Of course Africa's sustainable development must be conducted along the  Pan-
Africanist path. Nepad must be a firm economic arm  of  the  African  Union.
Nepad will not bring any sustainable development to Africa  if  it  depended
on G8 countries. Africans must bear the brunt of their  own  development  in
the  same  way   Africa's   freedom   fighters   struggled   for   political
independence.

Of course, two important questions  must  be  asked  with  regard  to  South
Africa. Can there be sustainable  development  without  land  dispossession,
where 77,6% of this country's population  is  asked  to  claim  crumbs  from
1913, consolidated by the very Constitution which is  supposed  to  liberate
them? Can there be sustainable development where there is dragging  of  feet
on treatment and prevention of HIV/Aids? This disease is an  attack  on  our
future. It kills mostly our youth who are not only our human  resources  for
sustainable development, but who are  our  very  future.  Izwe  lethu!  [Our
country!] [Applause.]

Ms  F  HAJAIG:  Madam  Speaker,  comrades   and   colleagues,   colonialism,
imperialism  and  neocolonialism  have  pillaged,  ravaged  and  looted  the
abundant mineral resources of  Africa,  leaving  in  its  wake  destitution,
poverty, hunger, despondency, slavery,  conflict  over  borders  and  scarce
resources.
Where there was stable government by  consultation  of  village  elders  was
left money-grabbing dictators, propped up by  rich  countries  which  needed
Africa's resources and paid a pittance  for  its  minerals  and  its  labour
force. Against this backdrop we have to look at the  problems  Africa  faces
today and also the existing new vision for the twenty-first century.

We in Africa stand at the  threshold  of  a  great  beginning.  It  is  both
exciting and challenging. The African Union  and  the  New  Partnership  for
Africa's Development constitute the ways and the means  we  have  chosen  to
take forward our goals, our visions of an African Renaissance and  make  the
twenty-first century an African century.

Africa is the cradle of humankind. Africa  is  a  continent  which  has  the
world's largest deposits of mineral  resources.  Africa  is  also  the  most
poverty-stricken  continent  in  the  world.  Nearly  half  of   sub-Saharan
Africa's 600 million people live on just 65  US  cents  per  day.  The  vast
majority of the  least  developed  countries  are  in  Africa.  Of  all  the
refugees in the world, the vast majority  is  in  Africa.  Of  the  children
orphaned by Aids in the world by the end of this year, over 90% will  be  in
Africa.
The mortality of children under five years of age is 140  per  1  000.  Life
expectancy at birth is only 54  years.  Only  58%  of  the  population  have
access to safe water. The rate of illiteracy of people over 15 years of  age
is 41%. There are only 18 mainline telephones for 1 000 in  Africa  compared
to 146 for the world as a whole and 567 for high-income countries.

Africa has the most unequal distribution of income  of  any  region  in  the
world. Income distribution is  negatively  skewed  against  women.  Half  of
Africa's children of schoolgoing age are not in school. This figure is  even
higher in rural areas and for the girl child. This means that  most  African
women will grow up in a world of illiteracy.

Twenty-six African conflicts have taken place since 1963, affecting  61%  of
the population. Today 21% of Africa's people are at  war  and  in  conflict.
Poverty, political instability and war go together.

In the period 1990 to 1996 the OECD countries  accounted  for  over  70%  of
global exports of goods and  services,  while  the  figure  for  Sub-Saharan
Africa was less than two percent. In 1997 as much  as  68%  of  the  world's
stock of foreign direct investment was in the hands of the developed  world,
while Africa had 1,9%. After 40 years of  independence  in  Africa,  we  are
still struggling with the eradication of easily controllable  diseases  such
as malaria, diarrhoeal infections  and  TB.  The  challenges  are  enormous.
Social, political and economic transformation of any society  is  usually  a
product of hard work and willingness to go the extra mile on  all  sides  of
the divide.

How do we eradicate poverty? Twelve to fourteen million people  are  on  the
verge of starvation right on our doorstep in Malawi,  Zimbabwe  and  Zambia.
Conflicts are often caused by scarce resources. How do we minimise the  risk
of conflict and manage it, or more  importantly,  prevent  conflict  in  the
first place? The developmental state must have the responsibility to  ensure
that the socioeconomic programmes are in place  to  provide  for  the  basic
needs of this populace.

The state, together with civil society, must emphasise the  desirability  of
certain practices and value systems, for example,  the  eradication  of  the
practice of female genital mutilation in parts  of  Africa,  or  the  unjust
punishment in the name of Sharia law in some places.

Most countries in Africa are multi-ethnic. Therefore, there is  a  need  for
tolerance, pluralism. Most countries in Africa are multi-religious and  need
to accept and respect each other's religion without imposing  any  religious
tenet. Most countries in Africa  are  multilingual,  some  are  multiracial,
making  it  imperative  to  adopt  a  circular,  multiparty,   multi-ethnic,
politically   plural   democratic   government.   Attempts   to   homogenise
heterogenous societies must stop, because it is a sure recipe for conflict.

To truly make the twenty-first century an African  century,  one  must  take
into account very seriously the question of women in  the  overall  strategy
in the promotion of Nepad. The human race can never be free if one  half  of
it is in bondage. As we approach the dawn of the new millennium, a  defining
feature of our increasingly interdependent world is that it  is  accelerated
by globalisation of production, trade, investment  and  finance.  Our  women
cannot be left out. We cannot talk about globalisation, about the  need  for
regional integration in a globalising world and  still  hold  our  women  in
contempt.
Women have borne the brunt of Africa's conflicts. They  are  the  ones  that
are the most vulnerable in times of conflict and  war.  They  are  the  ones
that are widowed. They are the ones who face insecurity - physical and  food
insecurity. They are the ones that are left alone to  pick  up  the  country
from its ruins. They are the ones that  are  left  alone  to  bring  up  the
country from its ruins. They are the ones that are left out in the decision-
making processes. They  are  the  ones  that  stimulate  the  conscience  of
society. They are the ones that mediate between warring factions.  They  are
the ones that face hostility  and  the  ones  that  nurse  the  wounded  and
traumatised.

The role of women as peace mediators is not in doubt,  while  Nepad  strives
to prevent conflict and, through it, provide solutions. Peace can no  longer
be just about peace-making  and  peace-keeping.  It  is  also  about  peace-
building and conflict prevention.

Women must position themselves and insist on good  governance,  but  how  is
that possible when there is severe under-representation  and  disempowerment
at all levels  of  decision-making,  which  is  a  severe  subtraction  from
democracy. Women must become the focus of social spending, which has  become
a major  casualty  in  structural  adjustment  programmes  in  many  African
countries.

To expect that Africa can progress  when  investment  in  human  capital  is
declining is foolish and shortsighted, to say the least.  Social  investment
challenges of health, education,  housing,  portable  water  and  sanitation
must be met. Women produce 70% of the food on  the  African  continent,  but
there is no food security for them or their  children.  Intra-African  trade
must be increased. Access to the markets of industrialised nations  must  be
sought so that goods from Africa  which  have  a  competitive  edge  can  be
exported.  Artificially   created   tariff   barriers   must   be   removed.
Artificially induced low prices due to massive farming subsidies in the  EU,
the USA and Japan must be removed.

I submit that unless gender is mainstreamed into  all  programmes  of  Nepad
and AU structures, our development agenda will suffer  serious  delays.  The
energy of women in terms of human resources is  not  adequately  used.  This
puts additional strain on African nations. Here  the  challenge  is  one  of
human resource capacity and institutional strengthening for  the  management
of global competition.
The length between women's economic position and  the  economic  imperatives
of Nepad needs to be understood. Across the globe, especially in Africa,  it
is mainly men who are retained as core workers, and women  are  pushed  into
the more exploited periphery. Unless we  address  this,  developing  nations
cannot move at the pace they need to. If we want to fulfil our objective  of
poverty eradication and a better life for the  people  of  Africa  and  make
this a truly African century, let us use all our resources.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mev die Speaker, oor die mooi en edele ideale van  'n  Afrika-
renaissance en die eeu van Afrika kan niemand stry nie. Vir  eeue  lank  het
Afrika bekend gestaan as die ``donker  kontinent''.  Wie  kan  dan  stry  as
Afrika homself verbind tot  vrede,  ontwikkeling  en  voorspoed  vir  al  sy
mense?

As iemand vandag van buite na hierdie debat luister, en hy bestempel dit  as
galgehumor, kan niemand hom kwalik neem nie. Hier staan  ons  ewe  sedig  en
voer hoogheilige debatte oor vrede, ontwikkeling en voorspoed in Afrika,  en
juis op hierdie selfde oomblik word  vrede,  ontwikkeling  en  voorspoed  in
Afrika vernietig, hier neffens ons, net noord van die Limpopo: vrede  -  dit
beteken nie net dat daar nie oorlog  is  tussen  lande  of  volke  nie.  Dit
beteken veel meer, soos  ruimte  vir  mekaar,  vir  gemeenskappe,  harmonie,
veiligheid van bestaan. Dit word alles op die skandelikste wyse denkbaar  in
Zimbabwe verkrag. Blanke  boere  word  soos  misdadigers  gearresteer  omdat
hulle 'n wet ignoreer wat deur hul eie hof  as  ongrondwetlik  verklaar  is;
ontwikkeling - terwyl Afrika sienderoë toekyk hoe dat dit  wat  oor  dekades
ontwikkel is, vernietig word aan die hande van 'n magswellustige  tiran;  en
voorspeod - terwyl 'n voorste leier van Afrika  sy  eie  mense  verdoem  tot
armoede en hongersnood en ellende.

Nee wat, ons moet ophou grappies maak oor Afrika.  Mooi  en  edel  soos  die
ideale van 'n Afrika-renaissance, Nepad en die Afrika-unie mag wees,  solank
as wat die adder aan eie boesem vertroetel word, gaan  niemand  ons  ernstig
opneem nie.

Die Bybel sê tog duidelik: Uit dieselfde fontein kan nie brak en soet  water
opkom nie. Afrika en die Suid-Afrikaanse Regering  verkondig  met  die  mond
vrede, ontwikkeling en vooruitgang, maar  verloën  dit  met  die  daad  elke
enkele dag dat Mugabe toegelaat word om een van die rykste lande  in  Afrika
verder te vernietig.
President Mbeki kan die aarde deurkruis om steun te  werf  vir  die  Afrika-
renaissance. Klein simboliese gebare kan volg, maar die  boodskap  sal  bly:
Kry  julle  huis  in  orde.  Indien  die  Afrika-Unie  en   Suid-Afrika   as
leidinggewende land in Afrika nie daadwerklike stappe neem  om  Zimbabwe  en
Afrika van mnr Mugabe te verlos  nie,  sal  die  organisasie  gediskrediteer
word tot 'n niksseggende poppespel. Net een enkele,  duidelike  veroordeling
deur President Mbeki sal dalk baie meer vir Afrika  beteken  as  tien  reise
oorsee.

Verder waarsku die AEB dat Mohamar Gaddafi van Libië sy  bekende  magswellus
wil bevredig deur homself in te wurm as die leidende  figuur  in  Afrika  en
die vader van die Afrika-Unie wat uiteindelik  een  groot  Afrikastaat  moet
word, met natuurlik die flambojante ridder van die wit limousine  as  leier.
Daarvoor misbruik hy Libië se sterk finansiële posisie en ons moet  daarteen
waak.

Die AEB wil die edele planne van 'n Afrikaherlewing steun. Hoe  dan  anders?
Ons is dan self deel van Afrika. Ons verlede, hede  en  ons  toekoms  is  in
Afrika. Hier wil ons meewerk aan 'n nuwe daeraad vir  Afrika  en  sy  mense.
Kom ons bring die realiteite van  Afrika  in  ooreenstemming  met  die  mooi
ideale vir Afrika. Kom ons hou op om die vinger te wys  na  verre  lande  in
Europa en Amerika. Laat Afrika  eers  sy  eie  voorstoep  skoonvee,  en  die
ideale van vrede, ontwikkeling en voorspoed  kan  dalk  net  in  werklikheid
word. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, no-one can argue about the beautiful and  noble
ideals of an African Renaissance and  the  African  century.  For  centuries
Africa has been known as the ``dark continent''. Who can argue,  then,  when
Africa commits itself to peace,  development  and  prosperity  for  all  its
people?

Anyone from outside who is listening  to  this  debate  and  regards  it  as
sardonic humour, cannot be taken  amiss.  Here  we  are,  primly  conducting
sacrosanct debates about peace, development and prosperity in  Africa,  when
at this very moment that very peace, development and  prosperity  in  Africa
is being destroyed right next to us, just north of the Limpopo: peace  -  it
means not only that there is no war between countries or nations.  It  means
much more, such as space for each other, for communities, harmony,  security
of existence. All  of  these  are  being  raped  by  Zimbabwe  in  the  most
scandalous manner possible. White farmers are being arrested like  criminals
because they are ignoring a law which has been declared as  unconstitutional
by their own court; development - while Africa looks on, aware of  how  that
which was developed over decades is being destroyed at the hands of a power-
drunk tyrant; and prosperity - while a  prominent  African  leader  condemns
his own people to poverty, famine and misery.

No, we must stop joking about Africa. As beautiful and noble as  the  ideals
of an African Renaissance, Nepad and the African Union may be,  as  long  as
the serpent is being cherished in our own bosom, no-one is going to take  us
seriously.

Surely the Bible states clearly: The same fountain cannot  produce  brackish
and sweet water. Africa and the  South  African  Government  are  advocating
peace, development and prosperity with their words,  but  with  their  deeds
they renounce it every day they allow Mugabe to further destroy one  of  the
richest countries in Africa.

President Mbeki may traverse the earth to enlist  support  for  the  African
Renaissance. Small symbolic  gestures  may  follow,  but  the  message  will
remain: Get your house in order. If the African Union and  South  Africa  as
the leading nation in Africa do not take decisive steps to rid Zimbabwe  and
Africa  of  Mr  Mugabe,  the  organisation  will  be  discredited   into   a
meaningless puppet show. Just a  single,  clear  condemnation  by  President
Mbeki could mean a lot more for Africa than ten trips overseas.

The AEB further wants to warn  that  Muammar  Ghaddafi  of  Libya  wants  to
satisfy his noted hunger for power by wriggling himself in  as  the  leading
figure of Africa and father of the African Union, which  eventually  has  to
become one large African state with, of course,  the  flamboyant  knight  of
the white  limousine  as  leader.  He  is  using  Libya's  strong  financial
position to this end and we must guard against this.

The AEB wishes to support the noble plans for an African revival.  How  else
could it be? We ourselves are a  part  of  Africa.  Our  past,  present  and
future is in Africa. We want to contribute towards a  new  dawn  for  Africa
and its people. Let us bring the realities of  Africa  in  line  with  these
beautiful ideals for Africa.  Let  us  stop  wagging  a  finger  at  faraway
countries in Europe and America. Let Africa first clear  its  own  doorstep,
and the ideals of peace,  development  and  prosperity  may  just  become  a
reality.]
Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, when we talk  about  peace,  development
and prosperity in the context of Africa, we  are  indeed  considering  peace
options and  developmental  processes  that  are  informed  by  the  present
material conditions in Africa.

At the same time, we are reminded of colonialism and colonialists  who  took
turns in taking Africa's wealth to Europe, in particular.  It  is  important
to take into consideration the fact that most African  countries  were  over
many centuries prevented from developing major  local  industries.  Most  of
these countries were developed  for  exports  of  raw  materials,  with  the
result that agricultural and domestic capital accumulation stagnated.

The consequences  of  these  designed  industrial  policies  were  dependent
economies with large borrowings. Peace, development and prosperity in  these
circumstances would mean a complete turnaround of the factors  that  led  to
this state of affairs in the first place. Secondly, it means  a  recognition
on  our  part  of  the  power  that  former  colonialists   wield   in   the
international development arena.

We should not lose sight of the fact that however peaceful Africa  may  want
to be, we cannot achieve lasting peace and prosperity for  as  long  as  the
Bush administration can bully other nations of the world.

The present-day international community, led  by  the  developed  countries,
have consolidated themselves in the IMF  and  the  World  Bank  to  make  it
possible for these countries  to  control  the  developmental  process.  The
power  of  the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank  should  not  be  underestimated,
especially in view of  the  fact  that  many  African  countries  owe  these
institutions billions and billions of rands.

Our response to these powerful  forces  should  be  unity,  irrespective  of
which  countries  in  Africa  are  the  favourite  of  these  champions   of
underdevelopment. We should become masters of  our  own  destiny,  with  the
eradication of poverty as our long-term objective.

At this time  of  Africa's  development,  there  is  therefore  a  need  for
capacity-building, to develop the  human  capital  that  will  serve  as  an
instrument for sustainable development, peace and prosperity.

Africa has come a  long  way,  through  struggle,  up  to  this  point.  The
struggle for peace, development and prosperity is a struggle  we  must  win.
[Applause.]

Mnr A J BOTHA: Mev die Speaker,  vrede,  ontwikkeling  en  voorspoed  -  die
onderwerp van ons bespreking - is sekerlik die  versugting  van  elke  mens.
Net so smag die inwoners  van  Afrika  na  daardie  wonderlike  dag  wanneer
hierdie toestand waar sal wees van ons hele kontinent.

Dit word algemeen aanvaar dat die vasteland  van  Afrika  die  geboortegrond
van die mens is en dus alle mense wat vandag leef  se  oorspronklike  moeder
is. Dit is iets waarop al die kinders van Afrika trots kan wees.

Dit word ongelukkig net  so  algemeen  aanvaar  dat  die  inwoners  van  ons
kontinent die laagste lewenstandaard in  die  wêreld  het  en  dat  dit  nog
steeds verswak. Afrika is die enigste kontinent waar die beskikbare  voedsel
per kapita steeds verminder. Die verskriklike hongersnood wat ten minste  13
miljoen  mense  in  Suider-Afrika  teister,  onderstreep  hierdie   toestand
besonder wreed. Hierop kan die kinders van Afrika nie trots wees nie.

Nogtans is daar hoop. In die onlangse tyd is daar  'n  vermindering  in  die
chroniese oorloë wat Afrika so lank teister, en Suid-Afrika kan  trots  wees
op sy rol hierin. Leiers in Afrika het ook  nou  die  inisiatief  geneem  om
verantwoordelikheid te neem vir ons eie toekoms. Die besef het posgevat  dat
geeneen na ons heil sal omsien indien ons dit nie self doen nie.

President Mbeki het in hierdie Huis gesê dat geen kind van  Afrika  ooit  in
die toekoms weer bang of honger moet wees nie. Daarmee stem ons almal  saam.
Dit is egter 'n tragiese werklikheid dat miljoene  kinders  in  Afrika  elke
dag bang en honger is. In baie gevalle sal dit 'n lang tyd neem om  dit  reg
te stel, maar in ander gevalle kan dit onmiddellik reggestel word. Dit  hang
net van onsself af. Binne een  week  vind  die  Aardeberaad  oor  Volhoubare
Ontwikkeling in  Johannesburg  plaas.  Daar  kan  onmoontlik  nie  'n  beter
geleentheid wees  om  aan  die  wêreld  te  toon  dat  ons  ernstig  is  met
betrekking tot 'n beter lewe vir almal nie.

Daar sal reguit gepraat moet word oor die misdrywe van  onlegitieme  regimes
op ons vasteland. Daar sal die wêreld se oë op ons wees om te  kyk  hoe  ons
hongersnood  aanspreek  wat  Suider-Afrika  teister.  Daar  sal  die  wêreld
oordeel of ons bereid is om reguit te praat  oor  die  oorsake  van  hierdie
hongersnood, net so reguit as wat ons bereid is om te praat oor  lande  soos
Amerika en Israel. So ver het ons dit nog nie gedoen nie.

Die  VN  se  noodlenigingskantoor  in  Harare   is   in   1997   geopen   om
voedselvoorraad aan te koop vir  noodleniging  elders.  Vandag  is  dit  die
grootste  sentrum  vir  noodvoedselverspreiding  in  die  hele  wêreld.  Die
enigste rede hiervoor is Zanu-PF se ongehoorde verbod  op  landbouproduksie.
Hierdie optrede is boonop ongrondwetlik, want die meeste mense  in  Zimbabwe
het Zanu-PF se grondplanne in 'n referendum verwerp -  so  onlangs  as  twee
jaar gelede.

Die situasie kan egter binne maande reggestel word deur Zanu-PF te dwing  om
hul sogenaamde grondhervormingsrevolusie onmiddellik  te  staak  ten  gunste
van geordende grondhervorming, soos wat reeds in Zimbabwe oor  die  afgelope
twintig jaar plaasgevind het.

Dit sal die kommersiële landbou in Zimbabwe  in  staat  stel  om  binne  ses
maande die hongersnood in oorvloed te omskep. Suid-Afrika moet  die  leiding
neem by die aardeberaad om die  hele  Afrika,  sowel  as  die  res  van  die
wêreld, te oorreed om Zanu-PF tot besinning te dwing.

Nie alleen sal dit die hongersnoodprobleem oplos nie, maar sal dit  ook  die
ware hergeboorte van Afrika wees. Om dit nie te doen  nie,  sal  'n  misdaad
teenoor die  mensdom  wees.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr A J BOTHA: Madam Speaker, peace, development and prosperity - the  topic
of our discussion - are definitely the desire  of  everyone.  Concomitantly,
the inhabitants of Africa are also yearning for the day when  this  will  be
the state of all of the continent.

It is generally accepted that the continent of Africa is the  birthplace  of
man and consequently the original mother of all people  living  today.  This
is something of which all the children of Africa can be proud.

Unfortunately, it is equally generally accepted that the inhabitants of  our
continent have the lowest standard of living in the world  and  that  it  is
still decreasing. Africa is the only continent on which the  available  food
per capita is steadily decreasing. The terrible  famine  which  afflicts  at
least 13 million people in Southern Africa underlines this  condition  in  a
particularly cruel fashion.

Still, there is hope. In recent times there  has  been  a  decrease  in  the
chronic wars that have afflicted Africa for so long, and  South  Africa  can
be proud of its role in this regard. Leaders in Africa have now  also  taken
the  initiative  in  accepting  responsibility  for  our  own  future.   The
realisation has dawned that no one will see to our wellbeing if  we  do  not
do so ourselves.

President Mbeki said in this House that no child of Africa must  ever  again
be scared or hungry in the future. We all agree with that. It  is  a  tragic
reality, however, that millions of children in Africa are hungry and  scared
every day. In many cases it will take a long time to correct  this,  but  in
other cases it can be corrected immediately. It  depends  on  us.  Within  a
week's time the Earth Summit on Sustainable Development will take  place  in
Johannesburg. There could indeed be no better opportunity to show the  world
that we are serious with regard to a better life for all.

We will have to be frank about the misdeeds of illegitimate regimes  on  our
continent. The world's eyes will be upon  us  to  see  how  we  address  the
problem of famine which is raging in Southern Africa. The world  will  judge
whether we are prepared to talk frankly about the  causes  of  this  famine,
just as frankly as we are prepared to talk about countries such  as  America
and Israel. Thus far we have not done so.

The UN's relief office in  Harare  was  opened  in  1997  to  purchase  food
supplies for relief elsewhere. Today  it  is  the  largest  centre  for  the
distribution of food relief in the whole world. The only reason for this  is
Zanu-PF's unprecedented ban on  agricultural  production.  Such  conduct  is
even  unconstitutional  because  the  majority  of  Zimbabwe's  people  have
rejected Zanu-PF's land plans in a referendum - as  recently  as  two  years
ago.

The situation could, however, be rectified within  a  few  months'  time  by
forcing Zanu-PF to immediately stop their so-called land  reform  revolution
in favour of a structured land reform plan, such as the one  that  has  been
in place in Zimbabwe for the past twenty years.

This would enable commercial agriculture in Zimbabwe to convert famine  into
abundance within a six-month period. South Africa should take  the  lead  at
the earth summit to convince the whole of Africa, as well  as  the  rest  of
the world, to force Zanu-PF to reconsider.

Not only would  that  solve  the  problem  of  famine,  but  it  would  also
represent the true rebirth of Africa. To refrain from doing so  would  be  a
crime against humanity. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, at  the  outset,  let
me thank all the speakers for their contributions  today.  Some  people  are
suffering from failed dreams, and for some  the  spectre  of  communism  has
been reflected or replaced by the spectre of  Ghaddafi  and  Mugabe,  but  I
want to believe  that  the  vast  majority  of  people  have  made  positive
contributions to this debate. I  think  their  contributions  have  shown  a
growing maturity that is developing in our  Parliament,  especially  on  the
side of some opposition members.

No longer do we see South Africa  as  a  European  outpost  on  the  African
continent, but we see South Africa as an  African  country  on  the  African
continent. [Interjections.]

Therefore, together we are able to look at the problems that we face on  our
continent and together we can work to see how we can deal with it.  I  think
what is important for us to reflect upon is that the vision of  the  African
Renaissance is not a new one. Many of our leaders in  the  late  eighteenth,
nineteenth and twentieth centuries put forward  demands  and  calls  for  an
African Renaissance. Unfortunately, as  some  of  the  speakers  have  said,
slavery, colonialism, neo-colonialism, indeed, the Cold War  prevented  this
vision from being achieved.

I want to believe that we are  now  in  a  position,  given  the  fact  that
democratic South Africa is a  part  of  Africa  in  a  real  sense  and  the
different international balance of forces, to achieve this renaissance  that
we all need so much. As many  speakers  have  said,  Africa  has  tremendous
potential, yet it is the poorest continent in the world.

It is clear, as the statistics show, that the vast majority  of  our  people
live below the one-dollar-a-day poverty datum line.  This  cannot  continue,
because if it does, we will not be able to sustain our drive for  democracy,
human rights, good governance, peace and stability.

Indeed, I want to say that the African renewal will not be easy. We are  now
faced with a situation of globalisation where all the statistics  show  that
the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, and at  present
conditions in Africa tend to get more marginalised.

So, we have to work together as a country, a nation, and as a  part  of  the
African continent, to deal with the African  renewal,  not  as  an  academic
exercise, but in the interests of ourselves.

I also want to say to some of my colleagues  that  the  developed  countries
have a responsibility, because there is now no Chinese wall  that  separates
the developed from the developing and the very poor countries.  Issues  like
terrorism, HIV/Aids  and  other  infectious  diseases,  international  crime
syndicates and environmental degradation know no boundaries.

So, it is in the interests of the developed  countries  to  see  how  -  for
their own future and stability - they can be a part of the  renewal  of  the
world, generally, in terms of a better world  order,  and  specifically  the
African Renaissance. [Interjections.]

Well, the developed countries took so much from us, we need it back - it  is
not a handout!

Let me also say that, as some of the speakers said, words are too  many,  we
want action now. I want to believe that that  is  the  correct  position  to
put, because we must get rid of the notion that in Africa all that we do  is
talk and do nothing. In fact, the African history is full of efforts,  as  I
have tried to indicate, for us to achieve something, but the  objective  and
subjective conditions did not allow us to achieve the  successes  we  wanted
to.

Africa is now totally committed to peace and stability. As we have  seen  at
the most recent summit of the AU, we have now established  organs  of  peace
and security and other institutional  frameworks  to  help  us  bring  about
peace and stability. [Interjections.] But it  is  useless  just  talking  in
terms of generalities. Africa in the past  few  years  has  made  tremendous
advances. Peace has, at last, come to Angola. There is some movement in  the
Congo, the Comoros and in Lesotho, to mention a few.

We also do not need to be lectured by some of  my  colleagues  on  the  left
about democracy and human rights. [Interjections.] As we  have  said  on  so
many occasions, they were at best people who lived on the  benefits  of  the
apartheid system, and were never vocal  exponents  of  democracy  and  human
rights. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

And I want to believe that, like all people,  children  learn  and  as  they
grow up they learn. My colleagues on my left are  also  beginning  to  learn
that in Africa we are committed to genuine democracy and human rights. I  am
happy to note that some of  them  are  beginning  to  understand  what  that
means.

The  African  Union's  good  governance  on  politics  and  economics,   the
protocols and the African Commission  on  Human  and  Peoples'  Rights;  the
protocols relating to CEDAW,  the  courts  of  justice,  the  new  organ  on
elections that has now been established, and the Pan-African Parliament  are
all institutions that we must use to  give  concrete  manifestation  to  our
quest for peace and security. [Interjections.]

Now, I know that the spectre of Zimbabwe confuses the  people  on  my  left,
not because they are interested in the Zimbabwean people. It is only  Mulder
who had the guts to say: ``We are  frightened  that  what  is  happening  in
Zimbabwe is going to happen here.'' So, their unconscious  fears  are  about
how they are going to protect their  own  privileges,  without  seeing  that
South Africa is an independent country with institutions. And, it  is  their
role that will determine whether democracy flourishes  in  this  country  or
not. [Interjections.]

I want to clearly state something here. Nazism arose  in  certain  countries
in Europe. Can we then say that all  of  Europe  was  subjected  to  Nazism?
Apartheid was invented in this country, but not all  of  Africa  experienced
apartheid. So, what happens in Zimbabwe cannot necessarily be  equated  with
what happens in South Africa. [Interjections.]

So, those hon members should  not  keep  using  this  spectre  simply  as  a
smokescreen to try to protect their own privileges  that  they  got  through
the wrong means under the apartheid system. [Interjections.]

They should rather use their privileged positions to  work  with  those  who
come from  a  genuinely  democratic  framework,  who  genuinely  believe  in
democracy, to ensure  that  democracy  becomes  established  throughout  the
African continent. People should not have a  one-sided  and  very  selective
understanding of what is democracy and what is not. [Interjections.]

I also want to tell the opposition to stop shouting all the time about  what
is going wrong in another country and undermine what we are trying to do  in
this  country.  [Interjections.]   In   fact,   they   have   a   historical
responsibility to work with us to help  solve  the  very  serious  political
economic problems in Zimbabwe.

I still have to get from the DP a single honest suggestion of  what  we  can
do to help the  Zimbabwean  people  to  come  out  of  their  political  and
economic crisis - not a single suggestion! [Interjections.] [Applause.]  So,
they can shout, they are weak and  useless  and  irrelevant!  All  they  are
doing is putting  their  fear  of  democracy  into  the  minorities  in  our
country, thereby playing a very dangerous subversive  role  in  this  sense.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

So, if they are serious about democracy in South Africa,  they  should  help
to consolidate it. And, if they are serious  about  democracy  in  Zimbabwe,
they should help us to ensure that the Commonwealth initiative, which  South
Africa and Nigeria have been mandated to  handle  to  bring  about  dialogue
between the government and the MCC, becomes a reality. [Interjections.]

HON MEMBER: Do it!

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN  AFFAIRS:  We  are  doing  it.  Well,  it  is
obvious  that  they  are  such  ignoramuses.  They  do  not  read  anything!
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Madam Speaker, on a point of order,  I  would  appreciate
it if you could make a ruling on  the  statement  made  by  the  hon  Deputy
Minister that  the  DP  is  playing  a  subversive  role  in  South  Africa.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, the hon  Deputy  Minister  is  expressing  a
view about the role of a party. I really do not think that it  is  an  issue
on which I need to make a ruling. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, let  me  conclude  by
saying that the UN Development Programme has been mandated by the Secretary-
General to try to depoliticise the land issue, and this  is  something  that
we are working on. We are trying to ensure that through the  UNDP  programme
we can achieve that. [Interjections.]

Of course, coming from that hon member, it is  not  difficult  to  be  that.
Compared to that hon member, anybody who has any sense and who is  genuinely
committed to helping people and to establishing democracy, will be  regarded
as a hypocrite.

Let me then say to some elements of the DP - the word  ``Democratic  Party''
is a contradiction in terms, honestly. [Laughter.] Because there is  nothing
democratic about this party. However, let me say that we are  very  keen  to
help  stabilise  Zimbabwe  and  to  work  with  all  political  parties  and
formations in this country to do everything possible to help the  Zimbabwean
people  to  come   out   of   their   political   and   economical   crisis.
[Interjections.]

This sort of screaming,  for  instance  ...  Let  me  give  hon  members  an
example. They are rattling on about  a  farmer  who  has  been  arrested  in
Zimbabwe and accusing us of doing nothing. If they had the courtesy  to  ask
us what we were doing, we would have informed them.

HON MEMBER: We asked you!

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  FOREIGN  AFFAIRS:  No!  You   never   asked   us.
[Interjections.] Our High Commissioner ... [Interjections] ... you will  get
heart attack if you continue to make such a noise! [Interjections.]  Let  me
explain to hon members that our High Commissioner in Zimbabwe is  constantly
in touch with all South Africans in Zimbabwe. This morning he was  in  touch
with the South African farmer  who  had  been  arrested,  and  he  is  doing
everything possible to defend the interests of South Africans in Zimbabwe.

So, the DP should not be selective in their concerns  about  Zimbabwe.  They
are rationalising the Zimbabwe issue. I have never  heard  them  talk  about
the black farmers  and  the  workers  in  Zimbabwe.  [Interjections.]  I  am
talking of the Zimbabweans and the interests of the Zimbabwean people. I  do
not make a distinction, as they continuously  do.  They  only  talk  of  the
white farmers and ignore the thousands of black  farmers  and  workers  that
are affected. [Interjections.]

So, Nepad, the AU and the vision of an  African  Renaissance  will  continue
with or without them. If they want  to  make  a  genuine  contribution  they
should come on to the train on a genuine basis, and, together, let  us  make
the renewal of Africa a reality and not what they are trying to make it -  a
failed continent. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                   NATIONAL CONVENTIONAL ARMS CONTROL BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, hon members, this  debate  on
the National Conventional Arms Control Bill comes  appropriately  after  the
debate on Peace, Development and Prosperity: The African century.

In introducing this debate, I wish to begin by quoting  our  President  when
he spoke at the launch of the African Union in Durban last month.  He  said,
and I quote:


  The time has come to end the marginalisation of Africa. We must work  for
  peace, security and  stability.  We  must  end  the  senseless  wars  and
  conflicts that have caused so much pain and suffering.

This law reflects our basic commitment to  human  rights  and  international
peace. It fits into the Nepad framework which  places  peace,  security  and
stability  firmly  into  the  renewal  of   our   continent.   The   African
responsibilities and African promises within Nepad are peace, democracy  and
good governance. These are not just promises  to  the  West,  as  some  have
said, but promises to the people of Africa, because they uphold and  reflect
our own commitment to  the  rights  of  Africans  to  dignity,  justice  and
ultimately a better life.

Since 1994 our Government has played a pivotal role in promoting a  rigorous
arms control policy within the country and worldwide.  While  the  apartheid
regime purposefully used weapons to fuel wars and  destabilise  the  region,
the new Government has embarked on a  programme  of  creating  a  new  order
which prioritises human rights and the promotion of international peace.

The Government has written these values into much  of  its  work,  including
the drafting of the White Paper on Defence, the very  establishment  of  the
National  Conventional  Arms  Control  Committee  and  the  destruction   of
settlers' weapons in the SA Police  Service  and  the  SA  National  Defence
Force, and in Mozambique.

Internationally our Government has written these values  into  a  number  of
treaties, including the Pelindaba Treaty  that  declared  Africa  a  nuclear
weapon-free zone, the Oslo Convention that  banned  landmines,  and  the  UN
Conference on Small Arms which was held in New York in July last  year,  and
which framed the first internationally accepted norms  for  controlling  the
trade in small arms. Clearly these are not just principle stands.  They  are
a practical commitment, expressed  in  our  country's  determination  to  do
whatever we can to help end the wars on our continent.

Today's debate marks a milestone in  the  history  of  our  country's  young
democracy. By passing this law, South Africa continues to provide the  moral
and political leadership  which  the  world  has  come  to  expect.  We  are
debating an extremely important piece of legislation  which  will  put  into
law South Africa's commitment to peace by regulating the arms trade.

The National Conventional Arms Control Bill provides a mechanism  to  ensure
our country's compliance with Government policy in respect of arms  control,
and to ensure the implementation of a legitimate, effective and  transparent
control process. It ensures this by the appointment of  a  Minister  who  is
not from a security-related portfolio as a chairperson of the committee.  As
hon members know, the chairperson of the  committee  so  far  has  been  the
Minister  of  Education.  This  tradition  will  be  continued  in  the  new
committee. The appointment of an independent inspectorate with  wide-ranging
powers is another example of the  Government's  commitment  to  making  sure
that the arms trade is regulated.
Essentially South Africa's arms control regime has emerged  from  two  major
sources. Firstly, it relates to the ANC's long tradition  and  participation
in non-proliferation and arms control initiatives under the auspices of  the
United Nations and other international  bodies.  Secondly,  it  has  emerged
from the ANC's links with countries around the world that  have  experienced
the disastrous consequences of the irresponsible and  uncontrolled  transfer
of arms.

Let me remind hon members of this House that the  NCACC  has  its  immediate
origin in the recommendations of the Cameron  Commission  that  investigated
the irregular shipment of dangerous weapons to  Yemen.  Our  Government  has
committed itself to working towards a regional approach  to  security.  This
common  regional  approach,  based  on  human  security,  goes  beyond   the
traditional narrow understanding  of  state  security,  and  it  encompasses
issues of socioeconomic development.  It  entails  the  establishment  of  a
regional arms register and a regional control mechanism for  regulating  the
flow of arms in our region. It entails regional co-operation  on  issues  of
arms transfer and the illegal proliferation of small arms.

The NCACC was set up to ensure compliance with the policy of  Government  in
respect of arms control  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  a  legitimate,
effective  and  transparent  control  process.  And  I  stress  transparent,
because as hon members who have read the Bill  would  know,  there  will  be
reports to Parliament and a committee of Parliament to ensure  that  members
of Parliament are kept informed about what decisions have been made by  this
committee.

The Bill goes into some detail regarding other aspects in terms of how  this
committee is going to work. I want to  emphasise  one  aspect  where,  under
section 15, the guiding principles are spelt out. The criteria in  terms  of
which the committee will make its decisions are clearly spelt  out.  And  in
terms of these criteria, the issue of a  track  record  in  terms  of  human
rights is clearly entrenched in this Bill.

What I also want to  emphasise  is  that  this  Bill  ensures  that  private
citizens of this country are regulated in terms  of  their  trade  in  arms.
This is the first of its  kind.  This  has  never  happened  before  in  our
country, and I think in debating this Bill we must take  this  into  account
and see that our country is giving the moral  and  political  leadership  to
the world which it has done this far.

In conclusion, I want to say I do hope that this House  will  vote  on  this
Bill, that they will support this Bill, because, indeed, by supporting  this
Bill, we will all be committing  ourselves  as  members  of  this  House  to
ensuring that when this regulation comes into effect, we will be  monitoring
those citizens in the private sector to ensure that they respect and  follow
the dictates of this law.

Lastly, I  want  to  say  that  members  of  this  House  are  going  to  be
participating actively in ensuring that South Africa does remain  committed,
as it has stated, to ensuring that there  is  a  responsible  arms  industry
that is operating in our country. [Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, I  am  sure
I express the feelings of the committee when I  say  that  we  are  relieved
today to be participating here. It has been a long  journey,  two  years  of
emotions and quest, but importantly, two years of teamwork.

We may stand up here today as a  Portfolio  Committee  on  Defence  and  not
agree  on  certain  clauses,  but  please  be  assured  that  the   National
Conventional Arms Control Bill exposed us as a  committee  to  a  number  of
challenges, and I think we came up on top as a committee.

The first challenge that we faced was taking ownership  of  the  process  of
the deliberations. The  Bill  had  been  referred  to  two  committees,  the
Foreign Affairs Committee and ourselves,  and  here  I  want  to  thank  the
Foreign Affairs committee for pointing out policy  gaps  and  challenges  on
the first draft that was available, and for their availability to  us  as  a
committee whenever we needed them.

The  National  Conventional  Arms  Control  Bill  seeks  to  put  in   place
effective, legitimate and transparent control processes that  balance  South
Africa's compliance with international  laws  and  conventions  on  the  one
hand, and national laws  and  policies  on  the  other  hand  and  also  the
creation  of  an  enabling  environment  for  South  Africa's  own   defence
industry.

The  Bill  puts  South  Africa's  position  as  a  responsible  conventional
exporter very clearly. It also recognises that  our  attempt  to  move  away
from our past and to do everything we can  to  avoid  weapons  falling  into
hands that could endanger national and regional security is really  serious.
The Bill holds that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee  is  to
be accountable to ensure that governments or entities  recognised  by  these
governments are not potential human rights abusers or do not have  histories
of human rights abuse. This Bill will also recognise  that  governments  and
conditions change, and that case-by-case assessments must be done.

Consideration of this Bill has been very interesting. When the second  draft
was introduced to Parliament and public hearings were  held,  the  committee
realised the extent of amendments it would  have  to  make,  and  a  serious
debate  followed.  We  asked  ourselves  to  what  extent  a  committee   of
Parliament could amend a Bill. When does a committee  reject  a  Bill?  What
are the implications for such action? In a parliamentary system  like  ours,
the Westminster type, could a committee of Parliament that  rejects  a  Bill
survive such action? What powers did Parliament give to committees?

We read up the rules and weighed the pros and cons, and decided to  use  the
Rules of Parliament to set up a subcommittee representative of  all  parties
in the portfolio committee to consider and to draft amendments on behalf  of
the committee. We went a step further and invited  experts  from  the  NCACC
secretariat and stakeholders, as well as the state law advisers  to  provide
the much-needed assistance. Every  phrase  was  debated  and  consensus  was
reached. Efforts put in by this collective  were  then  taken  to  the  full
committee for consideration.  The  committee  tested  every  line,  and  the
subcommittee sometimes lost arguments as clauses were again amended as  more
information and clarity were gained.

This experience was enriching. It bound us  as  a  committee,  but  it  also
respected the fact that  we  had  political  points  of  view  on  different
issues. We considered the preamble and although we are told  that  preambles
simply introduce the law and are not enforceable,  the  committee,  in  this
particular case, considered very seriously the implications of  a  statement
such as the one made by South Africa on this Bill.

Chapter 1 of the Bill establishes the NCACC and sets  out  its  objects  and
functions.  The  committee,  which  is  composed  of  Ministers  and  Deputy
Ministers and  any  other  person  the  President  might  want  to  appoint,
establishes guidelines and processes necessary for scrutiny.  The  committee
authorises permits and keeps registers of issued  permits  and  may  conduct
inspections or investigations into any trade  inside  or  outside  of  South
Africa relating to conventional arms. The committee must submit  reports  to
both Cabinet and Parliament.

Because of South Africa's rather colourful arms  history  that  led  to  the
Cameron Commission being set up, we could not  consider  this  Bill  without
going back to reading up again on  the  Cameron  Commission.  We  could  not
continue to just enact and, therefore, enforce the  ``business  as  usual'',
careless and doubtful conventional arms trade of the past. We  had  to  make
sure that South  Africa  retains  the  moral  high  ground.  We  spent  time
deliberating on clause  4(2)(f)  and  became  aware  in  the  cause  of  our
deliberations that the National Commissioner of Police is empowered  by  the
Firearms Control Act of  2000  to  authorise  the  export  of  firearms  and
ammunition to Foreign Affairs or their approved  entities.  We  also  became
aware that as the volumes of exports for  firearms  increase,  authorisation
of such weapons is then switched to the NCACC. We were told that  there  was
a gentleman's agreement on this and thought that  this  agreement  was  just
not on and that we had to do something to make sure that this is regulated.

South Africa entered into a number  of  international,  regional,  biliteral
and even triliteral defence agreements that put us under the  obligation  to
engage in security co-operation with other  countries.  We  are  also  aware
that weapons of all nature, including machetes, have been used in  different
conflicts on our continent. Since the end of the Cold War our continent  has
moved towards democratisation and disarmament,  with  our  country  involved
and leading in some of the resolutions and peace initiatives.

Chapter 4 of the  Defence  Review  captures  South  Africa's  concern  about
poverty, illiteracy and unemployment. It ponders on  the  large  numbers  of
refugees  and  disabled  people,  about  the  debt  crisis,   diseases   and
environmental degradation.  It  recognises  underdevelopment  and  political
instability that occur in most Southern African states.  All  these  matters
make clause 15 of this Bill very important to us.  I  must  point  out  that
those who have only glanced through the White Paper of  the  Defence  Review
tell us that clause 15 actually reminds them of pacifists. If  this  is  so,
this should have been pointed out in  1996,  when  this  House  adopted  the
White Paper, because to us what stands in clause 15 and in the  White  Paper
is fundamental.

Indeed, this Bill is anchored in  that  White  Paper  and  other  government
policies. Page 30 in Chapter 7 of the White Paper actually puts some of  the
issues even stronger than clause 15 of this Bill. It says that South  Africa
shall avoid arms transfers and trade which  would  likely  be  used  in  the
violation or suppression of human rights and fundamental freedom. The  White
Paper takes matters further and says that  South  Africa  shall  avoid  arms
transfers and trade that are  likely  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  its
diplomatic and trade relations with  other  countries  and  which  countries
support or encourage terrorism.

For those of us who accept that  every  country  has  the  right  to  defend
itself and its citizens, clause 15 is important. It draws the line and  sets
down the criteria for accepting and accessing applications for permits.

Clause 16  relates  to  the  ownership  of  the  exports  and  stresses  the
nontransferability of end user certificates and all the related conditions.
The Bill allows for the establishment of an inspectorate. In our  view  this
inspectorate is independent  of  the  Departments  of  Trade  and  Industry,
Defence and Foreign Affairs. This  inspectorate  is  given  some  powers  to
enter, search, test, examine and seize documents or property or objects.  An
inspector is required to identify himself or herself  and  to  hand  over  a
warrant empowering himself or herself to enter or to seize,  and  to  ensure
that whatever it is that is seized or confiscated  is  handed  to  a  police
official immediately in terms of the provisions of the  Criminal  Procedures
Act.

Clause 23 deals with the disclosure of information. The portfolio  committee
must thank all members of the public who made  submissions  and  focused  on
this clause. The  Centre  for  Conflict  Resolution,  Idasa,  Gunfree  South
Africa, the South African Catholic Bishops' Conference and individuals  made
valuable inputs.

Clause (1)(a) says that  the  committee  must  ensure  compliance  with  the
annual  reporting  requirements  of  the   United   Nations   register   for
conventional arms, and present to Parliament  a  copy  of  this  report.  We
recognise that we are  simple  parliamentarians  with  no  expertise  on  UN
matters. We recognise that South Africa will  respect  the  conditions  that
come with such compliance. We are happy  about  this  inclusion  because  we
will now,  as  individual  members  of  Parliament,  avoid  the  unnecessary
expenses that we have had in acquiring copies of the UN registers. If it  is
accessible to the world out there, then  it  shall  be  accessible  to  this
Parliament.

Clause  23(1)(b)  is  important.  This  is  the  report  that  will   enable
Parliament to perform its oversight role. Receiving detailed reports from  a
preceding  quarter  will  enable  us  to  hold  the  executive  to  account.
Parliament will be able to assess whether the guidelines  and  criteria  set
out in clause 15 have been followed. Parliament will be able  to  follow  up
and review.

Clause 23(1)(d) provides for a report to go  out  to  the  public.  Although
this report is not as detailed as the UN register or  the  quarterly  report
to Cabinet and Parliament, this report is important because  it  will  allow
us to track variances and spot inconsistencies, should these arise.

Clause 23(2)(b) protects the defence industry against industrial  espionage,
and importers have to keep their secrets. After all, it is not important  to
know how many brown envelopes go next door. It is more  important  to  guard
the contents of the envelope.

Clause 23(3) makes provision for the non-disclosure of information.  I  must
also point out that clause 23 is the only clause in this Bill  on  which  we
are not in agreement. Clause 23(1)(c) would have allowed Parliament  a  rare
opportunity to monitor executive non-final decisions.

Whilst countries like Sweden and the US are able to monitor,  recommend  and
even to take virtual executive action we were given to  believe  that  this,
in our case, would amount to  taking  over  executive  powers.  It  must  be
understood that we are a new democracy desperately trying to  do  the  right
thing. It must be understood that while Parliament needs  to  be  possessive
about its powers and jurisdiction, it also needs to  know  where  the  lines
are drawn. We do not want to do the work of the executive.

For me the real question has  not  been  whether  or  not  the  deletion  of
23(1)(c) sought to usurp executive powers, but  whether  a  young  democracy
with a very young Parliament that is not very well resourced  was  ready  to
take on the responsibility. As matters stand, security is a do-or-die  issue
on this continent. It is a specialised field, a pillar on  which  Nepad  has
to be premised and the rock to which the AU has to be anchored and, yet,  it
is not taken seriously.  Parliamentary  staff  members  are  not  given  the
requisite capacity. Parliament itself  does  not  have  capacity.  In  time,
South Africa will have proactive oversight.  We  must,  however,  work  very
hard on getting every member  of  Parliament  to  understand  the  rules  of
Parliament, the  role  they  are  supposed  to  play  and  the  powers  that
Parliament gives to committees. Only then can we hope  to  be  effective  in
our work.

In processing this Bill we learned a lot. We were  sometimes  quite  serious
and emotional, but I am sure  I  carry  the  mandate  of  the  committee  to
acknowledge the role that is played by the hon Velaphi  Ndlovu  of  the  IFP
and the hon Hennie Smit of the New NP. We miss  their  intervention,  humour
and brotherly advice, and we are sure that they are going to  do  very  well
in KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape legislatures respectively.

One issue concerns me, though, and I quote from the White Paper as follows:
  South Africa shall  establish  a  regional  register  which  records  the
  transfer of conventional arms and light weapons within Southern Africa.


  South Africa will provide data and information on arms transfers required
  by  the  United  Nations  resolution  establishing   the   register   for
  conventional arms. South Africa will promote the inclusion of small  arms
  transferred in the register.

That is what the White Paper says. Maybe I am out of touch, but I wonder  if
we have moved to set up this regional register. This is  important,  because
of  underdevelopment,  crime,  climatic  disasters   and   general   drought
conditions which result in hunger and diseases that are not  being  improved
by the free flow of light weapons.

If South Africa is thinking, as  it  thought  in  1996,  of  establishing  a
regional register to include light weapons, why is South Africa  looking  at
this ``bietjie hier'' and  ``bietjie  daar''  weapons  control?  Why  is  it
possible to think of a regional register, but not of a centralised  national
register? If it exists I will be pardoned, but if it does not exist, why  it
is impossible for us to start looking at legislation to correct this?

In conclusion, I want to express my  sincere  gratitude  to  the  state  law
advisers. They have been with us from the  subcommittee  days  to  committee
meetings. Many members of the Department of Defence have come and gone,  but
the law advisers stuck with us. Re a leboha ntate  Gideon  Boom.  [We  thank
you Mr Gideon Boom.] [Time expired.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Mr Chairman, in our view the authority to  export  arms  is
of a different degree of sensitivity to other types of  exports.  There  can
be few decisions of greater potential  impact  on  the  conduct  of  foreign
relations and on the lives of many people than  whether  to  permit  weapons
made in this country to be put in the hands of other governments  and  their
forces. There is understandable anger when it is found  that  South  African
weapons have been used to oppress or terrorise people, or  to  endanger  the
lives of our servicemen and women or civilians.

Until  very  recently,  our  present  Government  has  been  exporting  arms
secretively to countries involved  in  a  potentially  explosive  situation.
These  countries  are  India  and  Pakistan.  When  conventional  arms   are
simultaneously sold to aggressive rivals,  our  Government  is  clearly  not
fulfilling the objectives of not destabilising that specific region.  It  is
immoral. From this example, the need for legislation controlling the  export
of arms, which we are debating today, is clearly shown.

The most important section in this Bill relates to clause 23. The  important
accountability and transparency measure was removed from this  Bill  due  to
the interference of the hon  Minister  of  Education,  Mr  Kader  Asmal,  as
chairperson of the NCACC,  in  the  legislative  affairs  of  the  portfolio
committee, regarding reporting requirements of the NCACC  to  the  mentioned
parliamentary committee.

This objection of the hon the Minister came after  the  Portfolio  Committee
on Defence had approved this Bill earlier this year and had  been  set  down
for debate in this House. However, this debate was postponed the day  before
without any reason given whatsoever. I, in fact, wonder whether the ANC  had
been given any reason for this postponement - I very much doubt it.  It  has
been reported that this issue has led to  serious  differences  between  the
chairperson of this committee, hon Thandi Modise, and hon Minister Asmal.

This Bill, many months later, appears before this  House  without  any  real
form of transparency and accountability in terms whereof this  parliamentary
committee can exercise its duty. It will be a mere rubber stamp, due to  the
interference of the executive in the responsible legislature. The  issue  at
stake here relates to the decision by the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Defence
that the parliamentary committee could  make  recommendations  regarding  an
application for a permit to enter into a  contract  to  export  conventional
arms, which the committee is likely to approve. This clause would  not  have
conferred on Parliament  the  power  to  veto  a  pending  arms  export.  It
provides only that a parliamentary committee may recommend to  the  National
Conventional Arms Committee that an air arms export be rejected  ...  listen
... recommended to the NCAC that an air  arms  export  be  rejected  on  the
grounds that the export is inconsistent with  the  principles  contained  in
the Bill. It does not usurp the  executive's  decision-making  authority  or
undermine the principle of separation of powers,  as  the  hon  Minister  of
Defence  has  argued  in  the  committee.  It  was  only  after   the   late
intervention by the hon Minister  of  Defence  that  the  committee  members
were, in fact, steamrollered  into  abandoning  this  most  vital  oversight
function of this committee.

The apparent lack of honesty we as a country show towards our commitment  to
fully disclose all our conventional arms exports  in  terms  of  the  United
Nations  Register,  is  alarming.  It  is  clear  from  the  United  Nations
resolutions that countries  may  voluntarily  decide  to  ascribe  to  being
transparent and open in its affairs by notifying the United Nations  of  all
conventional arms exported. Once a country has  decided  to  do  so,  it  is
bound to make a full disclosure thereof. However, as publicly stated by  the
hon Minister of Defence in the committee, he  is  of  the  view  that  South
Africa is not bound to do so should South  Africa  enter  into  a  bilateral
agreement prohibiting such full disclosure.  These  two  views  are  totally
contradictory. Either South Africa must decide to make a full disclosure  on
a voluntary basis of all conventional arms exported, or alternatively  South
Africa must  indicate  to  the  United  Nations  that  it  does  not  intend
reporting the details of arms exported during the preceding year,  and  bear
the consequences. It cannot be both.
It is clear that  we  have  recently  acted  in  contravention  of  the  new
guidelines we have set  for  ourselves  in  relation  to  conventional  arms
exported, as stated in the Bill we are debating here  today.  In  the  first
instance, arms transfers to countries  where  human  rights  are  suppressed
should be actively avoided. In this respect, the  Indian  government,  under
pressure from international human rights  organisations  like  Human  Rights
and Amnesty International, has investigated at least 56 of its personnel  in
Kashmir for human rights violations.

It  is  ironic  to  note  that  the  South  African  export  statistics  for
conventional arms for the period 2000-2001, which for  two  years  were  not
forthcoming, indicate that all arms sales to Israel  had  been  stopped  for
the year 2001, whilst our own Government decided to sell  conventional  arms
to two different warring nations simultaneously - double standards!

I wish to conclude with a quote from the minutes  compiled  -  and  I  agree
with this quote - by the Parliamentary Monitoring Group of a meeting of  the
defence portfolio committee, made by the hon Thandi Modise:


  Clause 23 (1) says that we will get reports. I agree to a certain nature.
  She goes on to say that:


  Once South Africa volunteers to provide reports to the United Nations, we
  must comply. This debate frightens me, that South  Africa  is  not  being
  honest with what it reports to the United Nations.

This was said by the chairperson of that committee, Mr Kader Asmal.

May I remind this House that the net effect  of  non-compliance  could  give
rise to a situation whereby South Africa is again denied access  to  further
technology and services, with severe penalties being imposed  on  the  South
African National Defence Force. We oppose this Bill.

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Sawubona,  Mfazi!  [I  take  pleasure  in  saluting  you!]
[Interjections.] Sikhona. [I am well.]

Mr Chairman and colleagues, let me just start  off  by  saying  that  whilst
considering this Bill, we must bear in mind that there is no such  thing  as
a perfect Bill anywhere in the world. There is no such thing  as  a  perfect
law anywhere in the world. In fact, I could go on and say that there  is  no
institution such as a perfect government anywhere in the world. We  are  all
human beings. We err and we learn from that. This Bill  does  exactly  that,
correcting the past, correcting the faults of the past. This is how  I  read
this Bill.

Since 1994 Government has committed itself to a policy  of  disarmament  and
control. A key factor of this policy was  to  position  South  Africa  as  a
responsible producer and exporter.

In August 1995, the Government approved an interim arms  control  policy  in
terms of which a Cabinet sub-committee, which is now known as  the  National
Conventional Arms Control Committee, was established. The  committee's  main
function was to  ensure  that  arms  exports  conformed  to  South  Africa's
commitment to democracy - that is important - to human  rights,  sustainable
development, social justice and the environmental protection of our land.

The main objective of this Bill is to formally establish the NCACC in  terms
of the law and with a clear terms of reference. The  committee  was  charged
with ensuring compliance with Government's arms control policies.

The main features of this Bill, as I see it, are  as  follows.  It  provides
for an inspectorate, as the chairman of the portfolio committee has  already
said, to ensure compliance with the arms control policy; it  provides  clear
guidelines and criteria that must be used when applications for arms  import
and export are considered; and, finally, the Bill  is  aimed,  amongst  many
other things, at ensuring proper accountability in the trade and  export  of
conventional arms. What else do you want?

Amongst other things, the committee must - and this is  important  -  report
to Parliament every quarter of the year on all conventional arms exports  by
South Africa and, more importantly, provide this Parliament with a  list  of
all pending applications for arms exports.

Of course, this Bill seeks to correct the wrongs of the past with regard  to
what has happened here in the past. This Bill would monitor  companies  such
as Daimler-Chrysler and the likes, and to see that there  is  no  repetition
of the so-called arms nonsense that we heard about.  The  IFP  will  support
this Bill for those reasons and for nothing else. However, we  believe  that
this Bill is a transitional Bill. It is a Bill that can be improved  on.  We
agree on that. As time goes by, and as changes are needed, this  Bill,  like
any other Bill, will have to be improved on.

The IFP supports this Bill as it stands.

Mr A BLAAS: Mr Chairperson, when this Bill was on the Order Paper  in  March
this  year,  the  New  NP,  although  there  were  certain   comments,   was
comfortable  in  supporting  it.  The  Bill  was  then  referred  back   and
amendments were made which seriously jeopardise parliamentary oversight  and
which raise serious concerns. The New NP will, however, support  this  Bill,
because  one  can  hardly  be  against  any  action   which   ensures   that
conventional arms from South Africa are not sold to  institutions  that  can
abuse them.

This Bill  provides,  amongst  others,  for  a  National  Conventional  Arms
Control Committee appointed by the President. It  gives  guiding  principles
and  criteria  for  the  trade  in  arms  and  also   prescribes   reporting
obligations to Parliament so as to fulfil its oversight function.

The Bill, as it now stands,  has  an  inherent  flaw.  It  only  allows  for
retrospective oversight by Parliament.

In die Maart-teks was daar 'n klousule wat bepaal het dat daar  kwartaalliks
aan 'n komitee van die Parlement verslag  gedoen  moes  word,  nie  net  ten
opsigte van voltooide transaksies nie, maar ook ten opsigte van aansoeke  of
permitte wat onder oorweging by die komitee was. Die  klousule  ten  opsigte
van beoogde transaksies en permitte is nou geskrap. Die Parlement  word  dus
nou slegs in kennis gestel van transaksies wat  afgehandel  is.  Die  wapens
kan maar verkoop word aan enige koper wat  volgens  die  diskresie  van  die
komitee aan die voorgeskrewe riglyne voldoen.

Dit was  noodsaaklik  vir  duidelike  magsdeling,  aldus  die  Minister  van
Verdediging. Dit is 'n argument wat moeilik begrypbaar is.  Rapportering  is
mos slegs verslagdoening en nie uitvoering nie. Hoe  dit  magte  skei,  word
moeilik verstaan.

Die verpolitisering  van  besluitneming  is  'n  verdere  rede  tot  kommer.
Politieke aksies,  wat  wapengeweld  insluit,  spruit  voort  uit  politieke
magsbasisse. 'n Politieke magsbasis word deur die  besit  van  konvensionele
wapens  bepaal.  Die  President  het  'n  alleenmandaat  om  die   Nasionale
Konvensionele Wapenbeheerkomitee aan te wys. Die komitee, alhoewel daar  ook
Ministers in die komitee dien, is nie 'n subkomitee van die Kabinet nie.

Die komitee is dus 'n  politieke  struktuur  wat  politieke  besluite  neem.
Politieke interaksie maak ook somtyds  eienaardige  bedmaats.  Die  komitee,
met sy interpretasie van die riglyne en spesifieke vriende, besluit aan  wie
wapens verkoop word.

Die  enigste  verslagdoening  aan  die  Parlement  vind  plaas   nadat   die
transaksie afgehandel is. Indien die wapens in verkeerde hande  beland,  kan
daar net niks  aan  gedoen  word  nie.  Die  wapens  kan  tog  sekerlik  nie
teruggeneem word nie. Die  Parlement  kan  maar  net  kennis  neem.  Is  dit
parlementêre oorsig, soos deur die  Grondwet  beoog  word?  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In the March text there was a clause that  provided  that  a  committee  of
Parliament  would  be  reported  to  quarterly,  not  only  with  regard  to
completed transactions, but also with  regard  to  applications  or  permits
that were being considered by the  committee.  The  clause  with  regard  to
envisaged transactions and permits has now  been  abolished.  Parliament  is
therefore now only informed about transactions  that  have  been  completed.
Weapons may be sold to any buyer who, at the discretion  of  the  committee,
complies with the prescribed guidelines.

It was essential for clear separation of power, according  to  the  Minister
of Defence. It is an  argument  that  is  difficult  to  comprehend.  Surely
reporting is only reporting and not execution. How it  separated  powers  is
difficult to understand.

Politicising of decision-making is  another  cause  for  concern.  Political
actions, which include armed  violence,  is  a  result  of  political  power
bases.  A  political  power  base  is  determined  by  the   possession   of
conventional weapons. The President  has  a  sole  mandate  to  appoint  the
National Conventional Arms Control Committee. The  committee,  in  spite  of
the fact that Ministers also serve on the committee, is not  a  subcommittee
of the Cabinet.

The committee is  therefore  a  political  structure  that  makes  political
decisions.  Political  interaction  also  sometimes   makes   for   peculiar
bedfellows. The committee, with its interpretation  of  the  guidelines  and
specific friends, decides to whom weapons will be sold.

The only reporting to Parliament takes place after the transaction has  been
finalised. If the weapons end up in the wrong hands,  nothing  can  be  done
about it. Surely the weapons cannot be taken back. Parliament can only  take
note. Is this parliamentary oversight, as envisaged in the Constitution?]

Other questions that need to be answered are  the  following.  Seen  against
the background of Chapter 6 of the White Paper on the South African  Related
Defence  Industries,  wherein  an  integrated  arms  control  structure  and
legislation are envisaged, should this Bill be seen as  an  interim  measure
only?

Will it be possible  to  police  this  legislation  effectively?  How  cost-
effective would it be? Will it be possible still to trace  weapons  after  a
third and a fourth transaction? Would  it  not  be  much  cheaper  and  more
effective just to use the UN ``black  ball''  list  of  countries  to  which
conventional arms should not be sold?

In conclusion, we re-emphasise the fact  that  this  Bill  has  an  inherent
flaw. Conventional arms trade in South  Africa  becomes  highly  politicised
and  does  not  allow  Parliament  to  execute  proper  oversight  regarding
intended conventional arms trade activities.

Mr  W  G  MAKANDA:  Mr  Chairperson,  the  thinking  behind   the   National
Conventional Arms Control Bill  derives  from  the  recognition  that  South
Africa has no aggressive intent towards any other state. Armed  conflict  is
considered to be a very costly and disruptive method of  resolving  conflict
and should therefore be considered as a last resort in self-defence.

It follows, therefore, that the manufacturing and sale of conventional  arms
must be put under vigilant and effective control by the  state  through  its
agencies.  The  National  Conventional  Arms  Control  Committee  has   been
established and charged with this task. Its objects are to:


  ... implement Government policy regarding trade in conventional  arms  in
  order  to  establish,  apply  and  ensure  a  legitimate,  effective  and
  transparent control process in ... the Republic, which
     conforms to international law ...

Clause 3(a) of the Bill states that this legislation must:


  ... foster national  and  international  confidence  in  the  Committee's
  procedures for ... trade in conventional arms.

The imperative to conform to international  law  is  underpinned  by  clause
23(1)(a), which obligates the NCACC to comply -


  ... with the annual reporting requirements of the United Nations Register
  of Conventional Arms and simultaneously present to Parliament a  copy  of
  South Africa's annual report to the United Nations.

I submit, however, that clause 23 does not confer on  Parliament  powers  to
veto pending arms exports. The parliamentary portfolio committee  will  only
receive annual reports of permits already authorised  during  the  preceding
year. This limits Parliament's oversight role and  raises  questions  as  to
whether we have adequate mechanisms to keep conventional  arms  sales  on  a
straight course.
The concern is particularly pertinent in  the  light  of  reports  that  the
NCACC and the Department of Foreign Affairs  failed  to  submit  to  the  UN
Conventional Arms Register the sale of 28 G5 artillery  pieces  to  Malaysia
in recent years. There is also concern that South Africa  has  been  selling
arms to countries in the Great Lakes area which are embroiled in a  regional
war. It must be noted, however, that while South Africa  is  doing  what  it
can to control the proliferation of conventional arms ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking  time
has expired.

Mr W G MAKANDA: Chairperson, we support the Bill. [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Mr Chairperson, this debate takes place  at  an  appropriate
time, against the background of the arms  deal.  The  National  Conventional
Arms  Control  Committee  is  the  only  hope  for  the  nation  to   ensure
transparency and  accountability  in  an  area  of  notoriously  clandestine
deals.
We have  read  in  recent  newspaper  reports  about  our  exports  of  Puma
helicopters to the UK. Speaking as a member of the committee, I  am  in  the
dark as to what procedures were followed in this  disposal,  whether  proper
approvals were obtained and, if there were, whether this was done  prior  to
the disposal or ex post facto? Who are the ultimate  beneficiaries  of  this
sale? At some point the portfolio committee must demand  an  explanation  as
to why, seemingly, all arms deals always have a  nexus  with  the  so-called
Luthuli Trust. The committee must  probe,  at  some  point,  what  gave  the
beneficiaries of this trust exclusive rights  to  arms  deals  and  who  the
beneficiaries of this trust are.

Despite the mist covering the arms deals  in  our  own  country,  one  still
encounters a situation where pressure is being put on the committee by  some
people who seem to think that the procedures we  have  are  too  transparent
and too accountable. The NCACC  is  under  obligation  by  the  UN  and  our
Constitution to be transparent and accountable.

We accept the facts stated by the Minister of Trade and Industry that  South
Africa needs  to  benefit  from  the  arms  industry,  like  everyone  else,
provided there is free and fair competition in the business.

The ACDP will support this Bill, as it is a step  in  the  right  direction,
albeit not completely satisfactory in all respects.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, as  daar  een  aspek  is  wat  altyd
omstrede is, is dit wapenhandel. Daar is min handelsaspekte wat so  omstrede
kan wees  as  juis  wapens.  Ons  het  'n  wet  wat  'n  poging  aanwend  om
konvensionele wapens in Suid-Afrika te  reguleer.  Daar  is  egter  bepaalde
probleme. Die kriteria wat daargestel word vir  lande  of  persone  wat  ons
wapens wil koop, is basiese kriteria wat gebaseer  is  op  die  subjektiewe.
Ons sê byvoorbeeld ons verkoop nie wapens  aan  lande  wat  skuldig  is  aan
ernstige menseregteskendings nie, maar die vraag is of ons daarby hou.

As ons na dié wetsontwerp kyk, wil ek aan die begin sê die  VF  sal  hierdie
wetsontwerp steun. Soos die ander partye gesê het, dit is  'n  stap  in  die
regte rigting. Maar let wel,  dit  is  slegs  'n  stap.  Die  vraag  is  hoe
effektief hierdie wetsontwerp gaan wees. Hierdie wetsontwerp se sukses  gaan
afhang van hoe eerlik die Suid-Afrikaanse Regering  is.  Daar  moet  nie  'n
situasie soos in 2001 wees waar die wapenregister van die  Verenigde  Nasies
verklaar het dat die regering van Maleisië  dit  geopenbaar  het  dat  Suid-
Afrika 28 G-5 kanonne het aan Maleisië verkoop het, terwyl  Suid-Afrika  dit
nie geopenbaar het nie.

Ons moet onsself dan afvra of die Maleisiese regering  eerliker  is  as  die
Suid-Afrikaanse Regering. Ons kan dit  nie  bekostig  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, if there is one aspect  that  is  always
controversial, it is the arms trade. There are very few trade  aspects  that
can be as controversial as those of arms. We have an Act  that  attempts  to
regulate conventional arms in South  Africa.  However,  there  are  specific
problems. The criteria put in place for countries or  persons  who  want  to
purchase our arms are basic criteria based on the subjective.  For  example,
we say that we do not sell arms to countries guilty of serious human  rights
violations, but the question is whether we adhere to this.

If we look at this Bill, then I would like to begin by saying  that  the  FF
will support this Bill. As other parties stated,  this  is  a  step  in  the
right direction. Take note, however; this is merely a step. The question  is
how effective this Bill will be. The success of this  Bill  will  depend  on
how honest the South African Government is. There should not be a  situation
such as the one in 2001, where the  arms  register  of  the  United  Nations
declared, because the  government  of  Malaysia  disclosed  it,  that  South
Africa had sold 28 G-5 cannons to Malaysia,  whilst  South  Africa  had  not
disclosed this.

We must ask ourselves,  then,  whether  the  Malaysian  government  is  more
honest than the South African Government. We cannot afford this.]

We cannot afford contradictions in the United Nations' arms register. If  we
want to state quantities  and  the  other  countries  state  quantities,  we
should do the same, or else we are not completely honest.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the National Conventional Arms Control  Bill  is
a vast  improvement  on  the  situation  that  pertained  in  the  past.  We
certainly support the need for a committee to establish, apply and ensure  a
legitimate and transparent control of arms. Our view is further that,  given
the delicate and sensitive work of dealing with arms,  a  system  of  checks
and  balances  should  be  implemented,  and  this  system  should   include
Parliament and the portfolio committee in its oversight work.

We would also like to sound a word of caution on the danger of selling  arms
to countries with a dubious track record of  human  rights  and  fundamental
human rights. The Bill, in section 15 (c)-(f), recognises this  danger.  The
overarching consideration is that we live in a world which is fragile,  even
wicked, and that the circulation of arms could  just  fall  into  the  wrong
hands. In our world no country can be regarded  as  strong  and  secure.  We
need a paradigm shift from war to peace. We should  be  seen  as  a  country
that  has  emerged  from  repression  to  peace,  and  which  has  developed
expertise in mediation and negotiation.

These are attributes required in the new world order of  the  21st  century.
We should therefore develop an image and reputation of being a country  that
exports peace and justice, rather than arsenals of death.

With that qualification we support the Bill.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Mr Chairperson, thank you so much. I listened to some  of
the opposition speakers in this afternoon's debate. Some, like  the  DA,  on
the one hand support the Bill, but then they  criticise  it,  with  specific
reference to clause 23. They will never be  satisfied,  even  if  a  squeaky
clean process is followed.

The hon Schmidt used his imagination to try to create a debate  between  the
chairperson of the committee and hon Minister Kader  Asmal.  He  quoted  the
hon chairperson of  the  committee,  and  his  recollection  of  the  debate
confirmed to me that he works very economically with the truth. Fact of  the
matter is, the debate was live, it was democratic, it  was  transparent  and
open, and we specifically said that we did not want to take  over  the  role
and the functions of the executive in this country.

If they want to be in  that  position,  they  would  have  to  convince  the
electorate to vote them in in the next election,  and  then  they  can  take
that responsibility. There is  a  clear  distinction  between  oversight  in
Parliament and exercising the powers of the executive which had  been  voted
in by the majority of the electorate in this country.

We do make disclosures to the United Nation's register. We,  as  Government,
have done that even before this Bill was introduced in this House today.  It
was also communicated quite clearly; however, that  South  Africa  and  this
Government honours bilateral  agreements  between  this  country  and  other
countries. If they say they have no problem, that we report what  amount  we
spend in which category, but  do  not  disclose  the  quantity  thereof,  we
respect with integrity that commitment we have made. I leave  them  at  that
for the electorate to deal with in the next election.

The South African Government has since its inception in May 1994 - that  was
the year of liberation - committed itself to a policy  of  nonproliferation,
disarmament and arms control. This covers all weapons  of  mass  destruction
and extends to  concerns  relating  to  the  proliferation  of  conventional
weapons.

Fact is, the liberated South Africa has inherited  an  arms  industry  which
stems, by and large, from sanctions which were very successfully imposed  on
the apartheid regime at the time. [Interjections.] No, listen. We  view  our
arms industry not only as a national asset which  creates  jobs,  but  which
also acts as a spin-off to attract much-needed foreign investment, not  only
for this country, but also for this very continent of ours.

In acting responsibly with this  national  asset,  our  arms  industry,  the
primary goal  of  South  Africa's  nonproliferation,  disarmament  and  arms
control policy is to reinforce and promote South  Africa  as  a  responsible
producer and processor of arms, and a  leader  in  defence-related  products
and advanced technologies.

In 1995 the South African Cabinet approved an interim arms  control  policy,
which forms an integral part of  this  ANC-led  Government's  commitment  to
democracy,  transparency,  human  rights,  sustainable  development,  social
justice and environmental protection.

In line with its commitment to good governance, the Cabinet of this  country
decided that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee should be  set
up in terms of a statute. The terms  of  reference  of  this  committee  are
clearly defined by the Bill we are debating, ensuring  compliance  with  the
policy of the  Government  in  respect  of  arms  control  and  the  dealing
therein.

I submit to this House that this Bill will enable the NCACC  to  ensure  the
implementation of a legitimate, effective and  transparent  control  process
which will foster national  and  international  confidence  in  the  control
procedures of our arms industry. The fact that  we,  before  this  Bill  was
introduced in the House,  voluntarily  submitted  to  the  UN's  request  to
report to them, and that we are now going to report on a quarterly basis  to
Parliament, underpins the transparency of the process.

May I say, and I say this very proudly, for a country, eight years into  the
open season of democracy, we  are  not  only  doing  well,  we  are  setting
examples of international standard,  something  we  must  all  be  extremely
proud of in this House. In short, this Bill aims at  protecting  the  shores
of our arms industry from the human  sharks  intent  on  depleting  our  sea
harvest. We must accept the reality of our times, and place mechanisms  such
as this Bill in place which  underpins  the  integrity  of  our  efforts  in
rooting out corruption when dealing with and in arms.

Clauses 22, 23, 24 and 25 respectively deal with disclosure,  nondisclosure,
offences and penalties, as well as the disclosure of interests in  the  arms
industry. This is done because kickbacks and commissions are  by  and  large
the shadow of every arms deal, and because the intermediaries  find  fertile
territory in this effort. A self-respecting country  such  as  South  Africa
should therefore have a mechanism such as this Bill in place  to  check  and
regulate this inherent abuse. This we do by placing  this  Bill  before  the
House. We are, therefore, sending a clear message to our people and  to  the
world. The message is that we will always strive for a clean operation  when
dealing with and in arms.

In conclusion, the world and current situations  are  dynamic  and  are  not
cast in stone. No prediction or analysis of danger is static.  Danger  lurks
everywhere, and can strike at any time. Because no  nation  can  afford  the
luxury of being unprepared, we must nurture our arms industry  and  regulate
the sale of arms as mandated by this Bill.

The ANC proudly supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Mr Chairperson, hon  members  of  this  House,  I
have not gone through  the  mincing  machine.  I  want  to  go  voluntarily,
sometimes, through the mincing machine. There is no tension and  difficulty,
contrary to what might be said, between Comrade Modise and  myself,  because
all the presentations that were made, were made on behalf  of  the  Cabinet.
There were no personal interventions on this, because there is  a  unity  of
action, which I will try to explain in a moment,  particularly,  of  course,
for those who have come recently to Parliament and have not  recognised  the
extraordinary enormity of the crimes that took place before 1994.

I regret to mention the silence that was imposed on the Progressive  Federal
Party in relation to the invasions of Angola and the invasions  and  attacks
on the frontline states. I have great admiration for  Colin  Eglin,  because
he intervened, with freedom, to  talk  about  the  responsibility  that  was
incurred in the violence that was shown.

Not once in this House was there any criticism  or  any  opposition  to  the
extraordinary role that the  apartheid  regime  played.  [Interjections.]  I
could  look  at  the  Hansard.  No,  I  will  ask  Colin  Eglin  to  do  so.
[Interjections.] The hon member may have been there, but he  may  have  been
deaf. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

This is called a transfer - he is calling me dumb. I think it comes  from  a
particular position where he does not recognise his own position.

Margaret Thatcher once said: ``When I sell arms for Britain,  I  am  batting
for Britain''. Cricket, this is. However, in  our  context  it  is  evident,
from the activities of the National Conventional Arms Control Committee,  as
well as the provisions contained in the Bill we  are  debating  today,  that
our stance is fundamentally different.

We are not obliged, as the executive, to introduce this  Bill.  We  said  in
1995 that there would be a Bill. We are not obliged. It has  nothing  to  do
with our morals.  Other  countries  ...  [Interjections]  ...  this  is  the
provincialism the hon member is showing. We have studied  every  country  in
the world, including Sweden and the United States. I will come to this in  a
moment.

We have this autorestraint, because it was the right thing to do.  There  is
an element of schizophrenia. Every now and then I get a letter  from  people
in the DP asking why we are not developing our arms industry  in  this  area
and that area. There was a parliamentary question in 1995 as to why we  were
remiss in not exporting arms to create more jobs. People's  memory  is  very
important in this area. We are trying to have a little bit  of  consistency.
[Interjections.]

We come to this. As members, we are aware of the fact that  Cabinet  took  a
decision, exceptional in the world, that the chair of this  committee  would
not be a line function involved in trade and industry,  foreign  affairs  or
defence. No other country has that provision. It is usually  dealt  with  as
all-show by very junior people at an administrative level.

As matters stand, therefore, the perspective of the Cabinet was  to  appoint
a chair who was not directly responsible, who  spent  about  a  day  a  week
dealing with this. The Bill reflects that. The Bill says that the  President
will appoint the chair and the vice-chair, who will  not  have  direct  line
functions. That has been our practice  in  the  NCACC  for  the  past  eight
years. That is a very important development.

This perspective was formed because, in 1995, we  were  dealing  essentially
with a past mischief. The mischief was it represents the democratic  state's
answer to the activities of the merchants of death, whether it was in  Yemen
or Rwanda. I have gone through Hansard from 1992  to  1993.  The  democratic
predecessor of the DP, to my recollection, never asked a single question  as
to why US$10 million worth of arms were sold to  the  Interahamwe  in  1992.
The arms are still being used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Why,
in fact, did the Yemen activity take place? There was not a single  question
asked about that.

This degree of self-righteousness, best  reflected  by  Adv  Schmidt,  is  a
shameful thing. It is a shameful thing, because  our  democratic  Government
is not given the credit for taking the step and saying that there should  be
some restraint. I cannot tell the House now, because  of  the  pressures  of
time and our foreign relations, that we were the  first  country  to  impose
sanctions on, for example, a country  in  West  Africa  where  a  coup  took
place. There was an execution of a poet; where, in  fact,  there  is  large-
scale communal violence taking place on an island in south India.

Last week, the NCACC, after very careful consideration, took a  decision  on
a moratorium on the sale of arms to a Latin  American  country,  because  we
were not sure that the arms would fall into  the  hands  of  the  government
itself. That is the kind of thing we do. That is the kind of thing  we  want
to look at.

We were recklessly and carelessly plunged into activities that  are  against
our national interests. [Interjections.] I will come to that young pup  now.
There  is  a  kind  of  ``wetness  behind  the  ears''  in   some   of   his
interventions. We will come to this. [Interjections.] There is no  selective
morality. I will come to Mr Schmidt's question. I might even  deal  with  it
now.

We continued the  contracts  with  Pakistan  because  they  are  pre-freedom
contracts. Again, there was the obligation to recognise the  contracts.  The
moment the coup took place  in  Pakistan,  we  were  the  first  country  to
recognise that until there was an inexorable road to democracy, there  would
be no more contracts. There is nothing selective about this.

India is a democracy, whether  one  likes  it  or  not.  I  am  critical  of
countries by nature, as the Minister for the Police will tell hon members.

HON MEMBERS: Safety and Security!

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Sorry, the Minister of Safety and Security.

Our time is very limited, that is why we  took  very  careful  consideration
that the arms must stay within the government.

Also, of course, this committee has been very carefully  involved  in  small
arms transfers. We took  part,  with  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Safety  and
Security, in a United Nations Conference on the Register for Small Arms  for
Southern Africa. There was no political support for  that.  [Interjections.]
There was no political support. There will be a register for small  arms,  I
understand, in South Africa. But, our brothers and sisters did  not  support
us in relation to the register for  small  arms.  I  say  this  because  our
President, when he was Deputy President, said India, as all countries  have,
is one of the preferred political allies.  So,  we  have  a  preference  for
India. Therefore, we build it up. We now consider, whether in  a  situation,
not of ordinary tension, but in a situation that is much more  serious,  and
will look at them case by case. As the statute says, we will look  at  every
application case by case.

We cannot be  involved  in  indiscriminate  sales  to  undermine  legitimate
governments, stoke internal  rivalries,  and  weaken  economies  which  will
destabilise our continent. From the outset, then, the NCACC has  gone  about
its business in a responsible, accountable manner.  There  is  transparency,
unless one ascribes to the fact that the whole Cabinet  is  dishonest,  they
are all time-servers and all have  crooked  assumptions.  We  are  the  only
country I know of that makes  these  regular  reports  quarterly  and  every
year. These reports are on  the  website,  by  the  way.  They  are  on  the
website. I am not sure how many countries put their reports  on  a  website.
Websites should be accessible to anyone. Now, of course,  the  reports  will
be  made  to  the  parliamentary  committees,  which  I  think  is  a   vast
improvement.

The rationale and principles that guided the NCACC in the  original  Cabinet
directive have stood the test of time.  Fundamentally,  this  Bill  reflects
what has been the practice, with additions, over the past  eight  years.  It
has served the country well. It is not a temporary Bill. It is not a  flawed
Bill, with great respect. I think it is a fundamental error of  judgment  to
think it is a flawed Bill. It reflects the practice we want.

There is no best international practice. The  United  States  has  a  cement
that holds it together. The senate  foreign  relations  committee  meets  in
secret. They are gung-ho about arms sales. The only thing they  want  is  no
arms sales to potential enemies. Their arms sales are worth  US$10  billion.
Ours came to R1,5 billion last year. They are gung-ho about it  and  compete
with other major countries in selling arms.

We are  not  going  to  apologise  for  this.  There  is  a  process  and  a
transparency that has been applied  by  the  Cabinet.  We  have  done  other
things in the committee. We brought in police arms. We  made  a  gentleman's
agreement and brought in police arms export and the export of  dynamite.  We
have done these things because we want restraint in our own involvement.  We
are  particularly  careful,  now,  that  small  arms  are  not  exported  to
countries in Southern Africa, because there is a tendency for these arms  to
return to South Africa.

We have been practising that very carefully. The preamble  of  the  Bill  is
part of the Bill now, the Constitutional Court has  said.  The  preamble  is
enormously important now. It has legal effect.  The  preamble  has  been  an
enormous contribution by the portfolio committee.

I would like to share, very quickly, some of the experiences we had  in  the
NCACC. These are lessons that we believe have shaped  the  Bill  before  us.
The first lesson is that there must be regulatory mechanisms.  We  ourselves
decided  that  there  must  be  a  regulatory  mechanism  and  a  policy  of
restraint. We do not sell arms to all comers. We are not batting  for  South
Africa. We do not sell arms to all comers. We do not sell arms to those  who
have consistently violated  human  rights,  because,  with  respect  to  Adv
Schmidt, there are always skeletons in other countries' cupboards.  We  will
always have them. It is the fact that there is a graveyard in  a  particular
country that must  drive  one  to  say  that  we  must  not  assist  in  the
development of graveyards. Every country has skeletons, including ours.  So,
if we want to sit as a moral censor, we will not get anywhere at all.

Secondly, we have introduced the highly  praised  Military  Assistance  Act,
not motivated by any NGO, not driven  by  any  party,  but  in  relation  to
ourselves, about mercenary activity and  activity  of  a  non-military  kind
that assists in civil wars. This has been one of  the  most  highly  praised
pieces of legislation which we are enforcing,  and  the  committee  enforces
it. We are doing it, because it is  the  right  thing  for  us  to  do,  not
because of some external pressure to deal with terrorism or something else.

The second lesson is that there must be political  oversight.  There  is  no
country that has eight or nine Ministers and Deputy Ministers sitting  there
where, in fact, the  process  starts  with  the  departments,  goes  to  the
scrutiny  committee  of  senior  civil   servants,   and   the   secretariat
scrutinises all this. There is no other country that  I  know  of  that  has
this thorough way of doing  these  things.  This  is  a  very  extraordinary
process, and we are very proud of that.

There is a third  point,  and  I  want  to  return  to  the  United  Nations
Register. I wish to tell  Adv  Schmidt  that  since  we  have  set  up  this
committee, we have reported to the United Nations every  year.  I  think  he
should withdraw his extraordinary allegation. We have reported  every  year.
If there has been an omission, he should bring  it  to  our  attention.  The
register, by the way, does not deal with small arms,  first  of  all.  Where
did he get the idea that it dealt with small arms? It only  deals  with  the
larger issues, and we do not sell aircraft to any country. We  do  not  sell
this and that. [Interjections.] We do not. Therefore,  the  register  has  a
very minimum requirement. What we are saying is that the register of the  UN
must now increase its requirements, and bring  in  other  exports.  We  have
suggested this to the United Nations, and it has not  been  met  with  great
expedience.

What we are doing, therefore, is that since 1995, we are  the  only  country
that said there must be a moratorium  on  certain  countries.  We  have  not
exported arms, since the  outbreak  of  the  incidents,  to  the  Democratic
Republic of the Congo. We have not.

In any case, we are moving away. Last year, 30%  of  the  total  sales  were
from avionics, not small arms. There is a movement towards  using  our  much
more sophisticated avionic system in South Africa. With the Congo,  we  have
said that until there is irrevocable movement towards  peace,  we  will  not
sell any arms to any of the countries there. We have stuck to this.

I want to end by saying that it is very important that none of the  criteria
in clause 15 are self-executing. There has to be a judgment, and a  judgment
cannot be made openly, because there are  extreme  sensitivities.  Sales  of
arms cannot determine our foreign policy.  It  is  very  important  that  we
recognise that foreign policy determines the  sale  of  arms  to  countries.
Therefore, we spend four  or  five  hours  every  month  going  through  the
register and the applications. We  do  so  by  reference  to  the  terms  of
reference. On the other hand, we must recognise  that  they  are  not  self-
executing. They have to be  interpreted.  One  principle  of  the  terms  of
reference may contradict another principle, if one looks at clause 25.

With great respect, therefore, there must be a political judgment  which  is
done honestly and done well. I personally believe that this Bill  meets  the
needs of our country. South Africa enjoys  international  recognition  as  a
responsible country in matters relating to trade in conventional arms.  This
may be a lesson for many of us. I  do  not  think  we  can  take  the  self-
flagellation and self-criticism too far. This  is  one  area  where  we  are
leading the world, without any contradiction.

I hope that  those  who  have  worked  very  hard  on  this,  the  portfolio
committee, the officials, the public servants  from  government  departments
and the NCACC will recognise that this Bill takes us much further. It  is  a
credit to our country overseas, and I hope  that  this  House  will  support
this measure as  a  progressive  movement  which  will  be  re-evaluated  in
approximately four or five years' time. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
