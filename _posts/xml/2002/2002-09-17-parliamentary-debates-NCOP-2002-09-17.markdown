                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr N M RAJU: Mr Chairperson, I give notice that I shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  which  was
           recently held in Johannesburg,  was  attended  by  some  60  000
           delegates and more than 100 heads of state;


       (b)  with approbation and national pride that the event, a first  for
           South Africa, showcased our country in a highly positive  light,
           which will no  doubt  bring  about  immense  spin-offs  for  the
           benefit of all South Africans, thus proving to  the  world  that
           the Republic of South Africa not only  has  the  infrastructural
           capacity, but the necessary human  resources  to  host  such  an
           event of international magnitude; and


  (2) congratulates the Government, the Ministry of  Environmental  Affairs
       and Tourism in particular, and every South African who  was  involved
       in whatever capacity in advertising  South  Africa  and  successfully
       raising the curtain on one of the finest conferences held anywhere in
       the world.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Mr Chairperson, I give notice that  I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:
  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the war talk from world leaders;


  (2) believes that war does not solve anything;


  (3) acknowledges South Africa's position that whatever hostilities  arise
       in the international arena must be resolved by peaceful means;


  (4) welcomes Iraq's decision to allow the United Nations'  inspectors  to
       come and inspect whether there are weapons of mass destruction within
       Iraq; and


  (5) calls on the international community to find  peaceful  solutions  to
       global problems.

Me C-S BOTHA: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Huis sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  van die stygende aantal mense in  Suider-Afrika,  14,4  miljoen,
           wat in die volgende paar maande  deur  hongersnood  oorval  gaan
           word;


       (b)   van  die   doelbewuste   stappe   van   president   Mugabe   om
           voedselvoorsiening in Zimbabwe te  vernietig,  wat  beteken  dat
           hierdie hongersnood opsetlik op 6 miljoen Zimbabwiërs  afgedwing
           word;


       (c)  dat hierdie situasie nou die punt bereik het waar  dit  volgende
           jaar herhaal gaan word; en


       (d)  dat President Mbeki en die SA  Regering  se  beleid  van  stille
           diplomasie teenoor  Zimbabwe  allerweë  gesien  word  as  stille
           goedkeuring, en totaal teenstrydig is met die beginsels vir  die
           sukses van Nepad, wat President Mbeki self verwoord het as synde
           gebaseer op  'n  program  van  vennootskap,  wedersydse  respek,
           verantwoordelikheid en aanspreeklikheid; en


  (2) versoek dat Suid-Afrika onmiddellik hard en duidelik  sy  afkeer  van
       president Mugabe se optrede uitspreek om te keer dat  Suid-Afrika  se
       geloofwaardigheid saam met Zimbabwe s'n sneuwel.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the  increasing  number  of  people  in  Southern  Africa,  14,4
           million, who are going to suffer  starvation  in  the  next  few
           months;


       (b)  the  purposeful  steps  by  President  Mugabe  to  destroy  food
           provision in Zimbabwe, which means that  this  famine  is  being
           deliberately forced on 6 million Zimbabweans;


       (c)  that this situation has now reached the point where it is  going
           to be repeated next year; and


       (d)  that President Mbeki and the SA  Government's  policy  of  quiet
           diplomacy  towards  Zimbabwe  is  widely  perceived   as   tacit
           approval, and totally inconsistent with the principles  for  the
           success of Nepad, which President Mbeki expressed as being based
           on a programme of partnership,  mutual  respect,  responsibility
           and accountability; and


  (2) requests that South  Africa  immediately  expresses  its  disapproval
       loudly and clearly of President  Mugabe's  action  to  prevent  South
       Africa's credibility from dying with that of Zimbabwe.]

             DISTURBING NUMBER OF SHIPWRECKS ALONG OUR COASTLINE

       coastline over the past few months;


  (2) deplores the environmental damage these wrecks cause to our  pristine
       coastlines;


  (3) expresses its disquiet at the threatened destruction of the St  Lucia
       wetland and marine life and  at  the  fact  that  certain  endangered
       species in the area are threatened;


  (4) asks how it is possible that a high  risk  ship  can  be  allowed  to
       travel so close inshore;


  (5) calls upon our authorities, during the clean-up period, to ensure the
       maximum protection and safety of our beaches and wildlife  which  are
       being threatened;


  (6) calls upon the Government  to  investigate  any  negligence  in  this

       actions; and


  (8) thanks the KwaZulu-Natal Parks Board and government for  the  efforts
       to date in dealing with the present crisis.

                       ALLEGED RACIST INCIDENT IN SHOP

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its shock and outrage at the abusive way in which  a  black
       customer has been treated by the owner of Kwikspar in Monte Vista and
       his security guard;


  (2) notes that this was an utterly racist insinuation by the  owner  that
       blacks are prone to stealing;


  (3) appeals to the owners of the Kwikspar group to investigate the racist
       behaviour of this particular franchise holder, to  determine  whether
       such  conduct  does  not  constitute  a  breach  of  the  contractual
       agreement between them, and to immediately terminate his authority to
       sell the company's goods  in  that  particular  area  if  his  racist
       conduct is in breach of their contractual agreement;


  (4) calls on the police to spare no effort in their  investigations  into
       the racist attack on the customer by the security guard; and


  (5) furthermore calls on the prosecutorial service to spare no effort  in
       proving the racist motive behind this attack and  on  the  courts  to
       take this racist motive into consideration during sentencing.

Mr A E VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  I  would  recommend  that  we  move  the
following amendment:


  That, in paragraphs (3),  (4)  and  (5),  "alleged"  be  inserted  before
  "racist".

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Ms Ntwanambi, that  is
a proposed amendment to the motion. Is it acceptable?

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Yes, Chairperson, it is acceptable for that to be added.

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the

       blacks are prone to stealing;


  (3) appeals to the owners  of  the  Kwikspar  group  to  investigate  the
       alleged racist behaviour of  this  particular  franchise  holder,  to
       determine whether such conduct does not constitute a  breach  of  the
       contractual agreement between them, and to immediately terminate  his
       authority to sell the company's goods in that particular area if  his

       right-wing plotters will soon be apprehended.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  VOLATILE SITUATION IN MIDDELBURG HOSPITAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the  extremely  volatile  situation  which  has  arisen  in  the
           Middelburg Hospital in Mpumalanga, which renders health services
           to approximately 350 000 inhabitants;


       (b)  that three young doctors have resigned from their posts at short
           notice over the past two months  because  they  alleged  that  a
           campaign of terror was being waged in the hospital by members of
           a certain NGO and that even  more  doctors  are  threatening  to
           resign because they feel  that  they  are  working  under  life-
           threatening circumstances; and


       (c)  that two  former  superintendents  of  the  hospital  were  also
           allegedly violently forced to  leave  the  hospital  grounds  by
           members of the same NGO and that one of the trainee doctors  had
           to obtain an interdict to protect himself  from  their  actions;
           and
  (2) requests the Minister of Health to have the incidents investigated as
       a matter of urgency and to make an effort  to normalise conditions at
       the hospital in order to ensure the continued delivery of health care
       to the large community served by the hospital.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              CHILDREN DYING OF STARVATION IN THE EASTERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock that 166 children have  died  of  starvation  in  11
       hospitals in the northern areas of the Eastern Cape in the  past  six
       months;


  (2) agrees with the national Minister of Social Development that cases of
       malnutrition need to be prioritised by the Eastern Cape in  order  to
       drastically reduce the mortality rate of young children;


  (3) notes with concern that most of the children who died  of  starvation
       in the rural portions of the Eastern Cape were under the age of seven
       years and therefore were eligible for the child support grant; and


  (4) appeals to all sectors within the Eastern Cape  responsible  for  the
       facilitation of access to  the  child  support  grant,  such  as  the
       Department of Home Affairs responsible for the delivery  of  identity
       documents, the Department of Health responsible for the  health  care
       of children and the Department of  Social  Development,  to  increase
       their co-operation as  partners  in  service  delivery  to  the  most
       vulnerable sector of our society, namely our children.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

        INSTITUTION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ORGANS OF STATE BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Security and
                       Constitutional Affairs thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Order!  I  take  this  opportunity  to
welcome  the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister  for  Justice  and   Constitutional
Development back to her original Chamber, and call upon her to address  this
House.

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson,  it  is  always  a  pleasure  to  be  back  here,  and  may   I
congratulate the House on its new format. It is the first time I  have  been
here since the House has  had  a  facelift.  It  is  very,  very  attractive
indeed.

There are currently several laws that regulate and even  impose  limitations
on the right of a person to institute legal proceedings for the recovery  of
debt against organs of state, such as the SA  Police  Service,  Correctional
Services and the Public Service. The majority of  these  laws  provide  that
the creditor or plaintiff must, within a specific  period,  give  notice  to
the organ of  state  of  his  or  her  intention  to  institute  such  legal
proceedings. This is coupled with a  further  requirement  that  a  specific
period of time must elapse from the date of  the  notice  before  the  legal
proceedings may be instituted.

A further provision is also made for the lack  of  the  right  to  institute
such legal proceedings after the expiry of  certain  fixed  periods,  called
periods of prescription, which are calculated from the  date  on  which  the
cause of the action arose. The justification for these laws  was  summarised
by the SA Law Commission in October 1985 when it said:


  The circumstances under which the state can incur liability  are  legion.
  Because of the state's large and fluctuating workforce and the extent  of
  its activities, it is impossible to investigate an incident properly long
  after it has taken place. The state is obliged by law to follow  cautious
  and sometimes cumbersome procedures.


  Government bodies operate on an annual budget and  must  be  notified  of
  possible claims as soon as possible. The state needs time  to  deliberate
  and consider questions of policy and the possibility of settlements.  The
  state acts in the public interest and not for gain. Because public  funds
  are involved, the state must guard against unfounded claims. The state is
  an attractive target for unfounded claims.

However, the predicament is  that  the  existing  laws  have  proved  to  be
inconsistent. On the one hand, they provide  for  different  notice  periods
for the institution of legal proceedings against different organs of  state,
and on the  other  different  periods  of  prescription  are  applicable  in
respect of the various organs of state.

This state of affairs creates uncertainty that is further aggravated by  the
uncertainty around the constitutionality of  each  different  provision.  In
this regard, it should be noted that the Constitutional  Court  has  already
declared  some  of  these  provisions  to   be   constitutionally   invalid.
Furthermore, the periods of prescription provided for in some  of  the  laws
are  inconsistent  with  the  periods  of  prescription  prescribed  by  the
Prescription Act of 1969, which is the cornerstone of  the  laws  regulating
the extinction of debts by prescription.

Consequently, there is a need to harmonise and create uniformity in  respect
of the provisions of existing laws  that  provide  for,  firstly,  different
notice periods and, secondly, different periods of prescription. This  Bill,
therefore, seeks to  achieve  this  object.  This  it  does,  in  the  first
instance, by substituting  the  different  notice  periods  with  a  uniform
notice period of six months that will apply in respect  of  the  institution
of legal proceedings for the recovery of debt against most organs of  state.
Secondly, the three-year period of prescription provided for  in  Chapter  3
of the Prescription Act is made applicable to all debts.  These  issues  are
dealt with in clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill.

Clause 2 further provides for transitional  arrangements  to  ensure  smooth
transition between the  various  existing  statutory  provisions  regulating
notice and prescription periods, and the provisions of this Bill.

Clause 4 regulates the manner in which and the persons on whom notices  must
be served. It further sets out certain requirements to be complied  with  by
a creditor, if the notice is being sent by electronic  mail  or  transmitted
by a facsimile.

In terms of clause 5, no process by which legal proceedings  are  instituted
in terms of this Bill may be served before the expiry  of  a  period  of  30
days after the notice has been served on the organ  of  state.  However,  if
such a notice has been served before the expiry  period,  clause  5  further
provides that it must be regarded as having been served  on  the  first  day
after the expiry of the said period.

This is an incredibly technical piece of legislation. I am  trying  to  make
it more fun than it really is. [Interjections.]

I am aware of the fact that the  necessity  and  desirability  of  statutory
provisions of the kind contained in the Bill have been  questioned  in  some
quarters. Over the years some of our  courts  have  criticised  requirements
that are provided for in this legislation. The main point of  criticism  was
that  such  requirements  undoubtedly  hamper  the  ordinary  rights  of  an
aggrieved person to seek the assistance of the courts.

Other arguments could also be raised against the Bill. For  example,  organs
of state are not the only defendants that have extensive  activities  and  a
fluctuating workforce. Large companies experience the same problems  but  do
not enjoy special protection. Another argument could be that although it  is
in the public interest that public funds should not be wasted,  it  is  also
in the public interest that well-founded claims should not fail as a  result
of strict procedural requirements.

Although these arguments may be valid, I am of the  opinion  that  the  Bill
allows sufficient flexibility to an Act to enable a  court  to  ensure  that
potential litigants will be able to  institute  legal  proceedings  even  if
they have not complied with all the procedural requirements of the Bill.  In
this regard it is important to note that clause 3  empowers  a  court,  upon
application by a creditor and if certain requirements are  met,  to  condone
such creditor's failure to comply with the notice requirements provided  for
in the Bill.

I also respectfully agree with the Constitutional  Court's  remarks  in  the
Mohlomi case, namely:


  Rules that limit the time during which litigation may be  launched,  such
  as the provisions in this Bill, serve a purpose to which no exception and
  principle can cogently be taken.

In conclusion, I would like to make use of this  opportunity  to  extend  my
sincere appreciation to the Chairperson of the Select Committee on  Security
and Constitutional Affairs, the hon Kgoshi Mokoena, and the members  of  the
committee for the hard work they have put into  the  consideration  of  this
Bill. I might say that they are setting standards that we  have  all  learnt
to expect by now. I congratulate them. [Interjections.]

I have noted the amendments to the Bill that  are  proposed  in  the  Select
Committee's report on the Bill, and I am  convinced  that  those  amendments
will contribute to making this already complicated and  technical  piece  of
legislation more understandable.

Just before I close, I would  also  like  to  thank  the  officials  in  the
department who have worked on this Bill. They also have set standards  which
Parliament and people in our department have come to expect.  I  thank  them
for their input in this process and for  their  support  of  the  committee.
[Applause.]
Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, on behalf of the select  committee  we  are
humbled by the accolades by the Deputy Minister.

This debate indicates the seriousness that this Government  affords  to  the
issue of time limits for the institution of legal  proceedings  against  the
state. We have only recently emerged from an era  where  the  existing  laws
provided  for  different  notice  periods  for  the  institution  of   legal
proceedings against certain organs of state  for  the  recovery  of  certain
debts. The Bill proposes to create uniformity in respect of these  different
notice periods, so as to harmonise these laws as contemplated in  Chapter  3
of the Prescription Act, Act 6 of 1969.

One of the most important features of this Bill is the  wide  definition  of
debt. Debt is defined in this Bill as arising  from  any  unlawful  acts  or
omissions for which organs of state  are  liable  for  payment  or  damages,
including any delict or  liability  without  fault  in  terms  of  statutory
provisions. Fault, in turn, will not include debts arising from  any  breach
of contract. The Bill also defines the concept organ of state as  being  all
the national and provincial departments,  municipalities,  functionaries  or
institutions exercising a power or performing a function  in  terms  of  the
Constitution, or a provincial constitution, and any person  for  whose  debt
such an organ of state is liable.

As the hon the Deputy Minister rightly said, clause 2 of this Bill  provides
for the prescription of certain debts. This  has  been  proposed  so  as  to
create uniformity. Various provisions  which  regulate  the  institution  of
legal proceedings against organs of state, by prescribing  specific  periods
within which claims are to be made  or  actions  are  to  be  instituted  in
respect of debts  and  the  prescription  of  such  debts,  are  amended  or
repealed.

The Bill also provides that these provisions will  not  apply  to  any  debt
which has been extinguished by prescription before the date of  commencement
of the Bill or any debt in respect  of  which  any  legal  proceedings  were
instituted before the date of commencement. This means that  the  Bill  will
not have a retrospective effect on all claims which have prescribed  and  on
all claims which have already been instituted on the  commencement  date  of
this Bill.

The alteration of these notice periods was  effected  by  our  Constitution.
Although notice periods are  required,  the  Constitutional  Court  declared
that short notice periods were not  constitutional,  as  they  have  adverse
effects on claimants. The effect of  these  amendments  would  indicate  the
extension of individual rights. For instance, if a person had been  shot  by
a  police  official  six  months  before  the  Prescription  Act  came  into
operation and legal proceedings had not yet been  instituted,  a  three-year
prescription period would apply from the date of coming  into  operation  of
the Act.

This will mean that,  in  accordance  with  transitional  arrangements,  one
would deduct six months from three years and that would  leave  that  person
with two years and six months prescription time. Very interesting. In  order
to enable the creditor, in the case of an  old  debt,  to  comply  with  the
notice period provided for in the Bill, provision is  made  that  where  the
unexpired portion of the period of prescription  of  such  a  debt  will  be
completed within  twelve  months  after  the  fixed  date,  that  period  of
prescription must be regarded as not having  been  completed  before  twelve
months have elapsed after that date. Very interesting  too.  This  committee
applied its mind until we arrived at this conclusion.

Clause 3 of  the  Bill,  as  has  been  mentioned  by  my  wonderful  Deputy
Minister, imposes a duty on a creditor to give an  organ  of  state  written
notice of his, her or its intention to institute legal proceedings  for  the
recovery of a debt against that organ of state, unless the  organ  of  state
in question consents in writing to  the  institution  of  legal  proceedings
without such notice. This notice must be served to such an  organ  of  state
within six months after the debt becomes due.

The Bill also provides that  the  creditor  may  apply  to  the  courts  for
condonation of his, her or its failure to give notice  and  that  the  court
may grant condonation if it is satisfied that the debt in question  has  not
been extinguished by prescription, that good cause exists  for  the  failure
by the creditor to  give  notice  and  that  the  organ  of  state  was  not
unreasonably prejudiced by such failure.

In conclusion, the legal proceedings Bill will  ensure  that  the  different
prescription periods are all dealt with by one Act. There will be  a  common
standard, which is a three-year prescription period. The Bill  provides  for
one notice period for all debts.

We consulted widely, the discussion in  the  committee  was  vigorous,  many
questions were asked and it  was  pleasing  to  note  that,  after  all  the
interaction, all parties  in  the  committee  said:  ``Let  us  support  the
Bill.'' [Applause.]

Mnr P A  MATTHEE:  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  wanneer  die  Voorsitter  van  die
Portefeuljekomittee oor Justisie en Staatkundige  Ontwikkeling,  Adv  Johnny
de Lange, sê dat LPs sê hierdie Wetsontwerp op die  Instel  van  Regsgedinge
teen Staatsorgane is verreweg die mees ingewikkelde wetsontwerp van oor  die
100 wetsontwerpe  wat  oor  die  afgelope  agt  jaar  deur  daardie  komitee
goedgekeur is, kan agb lede aanvaar dat dit inderdaad ingewikkeld is.

Adv Labuschagne van die Departement van Justisie het ook aangevoer  dat  die
tegniese aard en kompleksiteit  van  hierdie  wetsontwerp  die  finalisering
daarvan in die wiele gery het. Nadat die wetsontwerp op  28  September  2000
reeds deur die Nasionale  Vergadering  goedgekeur  is,  het  dit  onder  die
aandag van daardie komitee gekom dat Wet No 94 van 1970 ten opsigte van  die
beperking van regsgedinge teen provinsiale  en  plaaslike  owerhede  na  die
Konstitusionele Hof verwys is. Daar is toe wyslik besluit  om  eers  te  wag
met die verwysing van hierdie wetsontwerp na hierdie Raad.

Die Konstitusionele Hof het toe op 4 Julie verlede jaar uitspraak  gegee  in
die saak van Mooizee versus Greater Germiston Transitional Local Council  en
die Hof het bevind dat artikel 21(a) van daardie Wet No  94  van  1970,  wat
eisers verplig om skriftelik kennis te gee binne 90 dae vanaf die datum  van
die eisoorsaak, inderdaad onkonstitusioneel is. Na  aanleiding  van  hierdie
uitspraak, en in 'n poging om die wetsontwerp te  vereenvoudig  en  makliker
verstaanbaar te maak, is daar toe verskeie breedvoerige wysigings  aanbeveel
wat na die  Gekose  Komitee  oor  Sekuriteit  en  Staatkundige  Ontwikkeling
verwys is. Nadat ons in hierdie komitee onder voorsitterskap van die  vorige
spreker hierdie voorstelle oorweeg het, het ons dit vervat  in  ons  verslag
waarin ons aanbeveel dat die Nasionale  Vergadering  hierdie  wysigings  wel
aanvaar.

Hierdie voorgestelde wysigings is  sekerlik  van  die  mees  omvattende  wat
hierdie Raad nog voorgestel het vir enige artikel 75-wetgewing wat deur  die
Nasionale  Vergadering  na  ons  verwys  is.  Dit  onderstreep  die   uiters
belangrike konstitusionele rol wat hierdie Raad ook speel  ten  opsigte  van
artikel 75-wetgewing. Die voorgestelde  wysigings  sal  hierdie  wetsontwerp
aansienlik verbeter.

Die nuwe voorgestelde voorwoord tot die wetsontwerp sit duidelik uiteen  wat
die redes vir hierdie wetsontwerp is.  Daar  is  'n  dringende  noodsaak  om
eenvormigheid  daar  te  stel  ten  opsigte  van  die  huidige  verskillende
bepalings  aangaande  die  verjaring  van  aksies  teen  die  staat  en  die
verskillende tydperke vir die kennisgewing van sodanige aksies.

Die Adjunk-Minister  en  die  voorsitter  van  ons  komitee  het  reeds  die
verskillende bepalings van hierdie wetsontwerp uiteengesit  en  ek  sal  dit
daarom nie herhaal nie. Alhoewel dit  'n  tegniese  en  gekompliseerde  stuk
wetgewing is, soos reeds aangetoon,  is  dit  uiters  belangrike  wetgewing.
Soos ons almal weet wat  al  as  regspraktisyns  gepraktiseer  het,  is  die
huidige verskillende tydperke van verjaring en  kennisgewings  'n  nagmerrie
vir regspraktisyns, baie waarvan al slagoffers daarvan  was  dat  hulle  nie
een of ander spesifieke tydperk in ag geneem het nie. Dit was  sekerlik  die
oorsaak  van  die   meeste   eise   van   professionele   nalatigheid   teen
regspraktisyns.

Ek is net jammer dat, soos uit die voorwoord blyk, dit lyk asof daar  steeds
sekere  wetgewing  sal  wees  waar  sekere  kennisgewings  vir  verskillende
tydperke behou sal word. Ek weet nie wat dit is nie, maar ek hoop ons  slaag
daarin om dit tot die uiterste minimum te beperk sodat ons op  'n  punt  kan
kom waar daar, ten opsigte van alle eise teen  die  staat  of  staatsorgane,
absolute eenvormigheid sal wees.

Ek hoop en vertrou dat  hierdie  wetgewing  meer  sekerheid  sal  bring  ten
opsigte van  hierdie  aangeleentheid  en  dat  dit  ook  sal  bydra  tot  'n
vermindering in die aantal eise vir  professionele  nalatigheid  in  hierdie
verband teen ons regspraktisyns. Mag dit ook die lewe van ons  praktiserende
regsgeleerdes makliker maak, sodat minder van hulle in die nag in  sweetangs
moet wakkerskrik net om te  onthou  dat  hulle  een  of  ander  tydperk  nie
nagekom het nie. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Mr Chairperson,  when  the  Chairperson  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development, Adv  Johnny  de  Lange,
states that MPs are  saying  that  this  Institution  of  Legal  Proceedings
against Organs of State Bill is by far the most complex  of  the  more  than
100 Bills that have been passed  by  that  committee  over  the  past  eight
years, then hon members can accept that it is indeed complex.

Adv Labuschagne of the Department  of  Justice  has  also  argued  that  the
technical nature and complexity of  this  Bill  hindered  its  finalisation.
After the Bill had already been agreed to by the  National  Assembly  on  28
September 2000, it came to that committee's attention  that  Act  No  94  of
1970 in respect of the limitation on legal  proceedings  against  provincial
and local authorities had been referred to the Constitutional Court. It  was
then wisely decided to wait before referring the Bill to this Council.

On 4 July of last year the Constitutional Court then gave a  ruling  in  the
case of Mooizee v Greater Germiston Transitional  Local  Council,  with  the
Court finding that section 21(a)  of  Act  No  94  of  1970,  which  compels
claimants to give written notice within 90 days from the date of  the  cause
of the claim, was indeed unconstitutional. In consequence of  this  finding,
and in an attempt to simplify the Bill and make  it  easier  to  understand,
various extensive amendments were then recommended which  were  referred  to
the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional  Development.  After  we
had considered these proposals in this committee under the  chairmanship  of
the previous speaker, we then included  this  in  our  report  in  which  we
recommend that the National Assembly accept these amendments.

These proposed amendments must surely be among the most  comprehensive  ones
ever proposed by this Council regarding any  section  75  legislation  which
the National Assembly had referred to  us.  This  emphasises  the  extremely
important constitutional role  that  is  also  played  by  this  Council  in
respect of section 75 legislation.  The  proposed  amendments  will  greatly
improve this Bill.

The newly proposed preface to the Bill clearly  sets  out  the  reasons  for
this Bill. There is an urgent need to establish  uniformity  in  respect  of
the currently differing provisions regarding  the  prescription  of  actions
against the state and the differing periods for  the  notification  of  such
actions.

The Deputy Minister and the chairperson of our committee have already  given
an explanation as regards the various provisions of this  Bill  and  I  will
therefore not repeat that. Although it is a technical and complex  piece  of
legislation, as has already been pointed  out,  it  is  extremely  important
legislation. As all of us who have practised as  legal  practitioners  know,
the present differing periods  for  prescription  and  notifications  are  a
nightmare for legal practitioners, many of whom have already  fallen  victim
to not having taken some or other specific period into  consideration.  That
was  certainly  the  cause  of  the  majority  of  claims  for  professional
negligence against legal practitioners.

I am just sorry that, as is clear from the preface,  it  would  appear  that
certain  legislation  will  remain  in  which  certain   notifications   for
different periods will be retained. I have no idea what it is,  but  I  hope
we succeed in restricting it to the absolute minimum, so that we  may  reach
a point where, in respect of all claims  against  the  state  or  organs  of
state, there will be absolute uniformity.

I hope and trust that this legislation will bring more certainty in  respect
of this matter and that it will also contribute to a decline in  the  number
of claims of professional  negligence  in  this  regard  against  our  legal
practitioners. May it  also  make  life  easier  for  our  practising  legal
practitioners, so that fewer of them have to wake up with a start at  night,
in a cold sweat because  they  have  just  remembered  that  they  have  not
complied with some or other period. [Applause.]]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, our Constitution devotes  an  entire  chapter
to public administration, that is Chapter 10. That is what is expected of  a
constitutional democracy, but we go a step further in order to  enhance  our
checks and balances on matters of governance by putting forward  this  piece
of legislation  correctly  before  the  sceptics  would  claim  and  scream:
``Justice delayed is justice denied.''

The ANC is the leading force for transformation of organs of  state  in  our
country. We believe that the transformation  of  state  organs  is  an  all-
encompassing process. It  involves  not  only  transformation  in  terms  of
representivity, but also transformation in terms of the way in which  organs
of state operate. In our view organs of state are  really  servants  of  the
people and must conduct their business in  a  way  that  shows  respect  and
dignity for our people.

We also understand that the strict limitations placed on the institution  of
legal proceedings against organs of state cannot  really  be  looked  at  in
isolation  from  our  political  history,  in  which   the   principles   of
accountability and transparency  of  state  institutions  were  deliberately
ignored to make  it  possible  and  easier  for  the  apartheid  government,
through its many state organs, to implement  its  unjust  policies.  It  was
clearly an attempt to limit  the  opportunity  for  victims  of  racist  and
discriminatory policies to challenge the unjust practices by  state  organs.
These limitations are incompatible with our new democracy, in which  respect
for human dignity, accountability  and  transparency  of  state  organs  are
fundamental principles of governance, as stipulated in the Bill of Rights.

The Institution of  Legal  Proceedings  against  Organs  of  State  Bill  is
another  weapon  in  our  attempt  to  fundamentally  transform  the  social
relations between Government and the governed.  Its  main  objective  is  to
streamline all provisions in existing laws that deal with  different  notice
periods for the institution of legal proceedings against organs of state  in
respect of certain debts, by replacing it with a single notice  period  that
will be applicable to all organs of state.

Currently we sit with a situation in  which  different  notice  periods  are
required for the institution of legal proceedings against  different  organs
of state. Many of these periods are  very  short  and  this  in  itself  may
create serious difficulties for both a person and the state.

The short notice period does not give people who may have legitimate  claims
against organs of state enough time to institute proceedings.  This  may  be
inconsistent  with  the  constitutional  right  which  section  34  of   the
Constitution bestows on everyone to have his  or  her  justifiable  disputes
settled by a court of law.

Even where a person is successful in complying with the notice  period,  the
organ of state on the other  hand  may  not  be  given  sufficient  time  to
investigate the complaint. With their extensive activities and  large  staff
which  tends  to  shift,  the  organs  of  state  need  the  opportunity  to
investigate claims in order to consider  them  responsibly  and  to  decide,
before going into litigation, whether these claims are justifiable or not.
Apart from this, there is  another  compelling  reason  why  this  Bill  has
become  necessary.  The  numerous  provisions  which  lay   down   different
requirements in different Acts create uncertainty.  This  is  aggravated  by
the question of the constitutionality of the different provisions.

The South African Law Commission in a 1998 report  identified  a  number  of
provisions which  limited  the  institution  of  action  against  Government
institutions or persons  for  whose  actions  Government  institutions  were
liable in law. This Bill is therefore an attempt to rectify this situation.

This Bill also gives the court having  jurisdiction  the  power  to  condone
failure to comply with the notice requirement if sound reasons  existed  for
such a failure. This is a particularly  important  provision.  Many  of  our
people are illiterate and therefore do not know  they  may  have  legitimate
claims against organs of  state,  which  need  to  be  instituted  within  a
certain time period.

The most important aspect of this Bill is the fact that it  creates  a  fair
balance  between  the  rights  of  ordinary  people   to   institute   legal
proceedings against organs of state and the need to protect organs of  state
against  unnecessary  legal  action.  We   therefore   support   the   Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, there is a distinct disadvantage in  speaking  so
far down the list when debating a Bill of this nature and I am going to  cut
out all of the technical issues that have already been referred to  from  my
speech. If I miss one or two, please bear with me.

Historically the state and most  of  its  organs  enjoyed  the  benefits  of
certain time bars and shortened periods of  prescription  which  placed  the
state and those various organs of state in a more favourable  position  than
the  ordinary  citizen.  More  significantly,  it  restricted  the  ordinary
citizen's rights to have access to the courts when he or she had  a  dispute
with the state or its organs.

These laws relating to time bars and prescription were  not  always  uniform
and were found in a myriad of different Acts, such as those relating to  the
SA  Police  Service  and  provincial  and  local  governments.  Many   legal
practitioners had difficulty in keeping track of  the  different  time  bars
and periods of prescription. One could not reasonably expect  a  lay  person
to know how to secure and enforce his or her rights in those circumstances.

The problem was investigated by the Law Commission and  their  research  and
proposal was one of the prime motivating factors in the development  of  the
present Bill. After the Bill was passed by the relevant portfolio  committee
in the National Assembly, a case was referred to  the  Constitutional  Court
to confirm the court of first instance's  finding  that  the  provisions  of
certain sections of the Limitations and Legal  Proceedings  (Provincial  and
Local Authorities) Act, Act 94 of 1970, were unconstitutional. Here I  refer
to the case of Mooizee vs Greater Germiston Transitional Local Council.

In short, the  Constitutional  Court  confirmed  that  the  relevant  notice
period in favour of the local  authority  was  unconstitutional.  Once  this
case had been referred to the Constitutional  Court,  the  select  committee
suspended  the  processing  of  the  Bill  to  await  the  ruling   of   the
Constitutional Court, the motivation for this being that we wanted  to  have
sight of the Constitutional Court's ruling to  obtain  the  benefit  of  any
guidance such judgement might give us.
This Bill makes time bars  and  periods  of  prescription  uniform  for  all
organs of state. It extends the period in which notice must be given to  the
relevant organ of state from 90 days to six months. The need to give  organs
of state notice of the contemplated claim was re-examined and  confirmed  by
the Constitutional Court in the Mooizee case. This notice period  was  found
to be necessary in order to enable the organ of  state  to  investigate  the
matter while the evidence relevant to the matter was still available.

The court may even condone noncompliance with the need  to  give  notice  in
appropriate circumstances. The committee considered whether the  application
of this Bill should be retrospective to the changeover in 1994  to  the  new
constitutional  order.  The   committee   felt   that   making   this   Bill
retrospective would  create  an  untenable  situation  in  relation  to  the
state's liability and the legal uncertainty of making the Act  retrospective
was unacceptable.

The select committee has proposed certain amendments which will be  referred
back  to  the  National  Assembly.  This  Bill  sets  up  an  equitable  and
constitutional relationship between the individual and  the  state  and  for
these reasons the DP supports this Bill.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  I  have  heard
the request from Mr Bhengu that his  name  be  removed  from  the  speakers'
list. I now call upon the hon P D N Maloyi.

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, last night I had a very long  discussion  with
the Chairperson of the Select Committee. I requested  him  to  increase  the
time allocated to me because I felt that six minutes was  very  little.  But
he could not agree with me. Now I will  request  hon  members,  particularly
the hon Setona, not to be bored and sleepy, but just to listen  to  my  long
speech. [Laughter.]

In summarising what the other members have said earlier - as I am trying  to
stick to six minutes - the Bill seeks to harmonise and create uniformity  in
respect of the provisions of  existing  laws  which  provide  for  different
notice periods for the institution  of  legal  proceedings  against  certain
organs of state for the recovery of certain debts.

I do not want to spoil what the hon the Deputy Minister is going to  say.  I
think, at this point,  I  should  say  that  the  ANC  supports  this  Bill.
[Laughter.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Maybe  the  hon
Mr Lever was right in expressing his predicament. [Laughter.]

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, I would like to thank everybody for their inputs,  as  well  as
those who chose to remain silent. It is a master of debate and  conversation
who knows when not to speak, and the members have mastered it. I would  like
to say that there seems to be general support for this Bill. It has  been  a
long time coming, but there have been very good reasons for the wait.

The amendments that have been made, as pointed out, will in  due  course  be
referred back to the National Assembly and we will await their  response.  I
can only believe that it will be a positive response. I am in fact sure,  as
I know the way members work, that they  have  probably  liaised  with  their
colleagues in any event.

I would like to thank the Council for the time, the debate and  the  support
of this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
                        AFFAIRS - NAIROBI CONVENTION

Rev M CHABAKU: Hon Deputy Chairperson  and  hon  members  of  this  esteemed
Council. I beg your  leave  to  make  this  humble  presentation.  The  East
African region covers four coastal countries along the East  African  coast,
namely Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and Somalia, one large  island  which  is
also Madagascar, and three smaller island states,  which  are  the  Comoros,
Mauritius and the Seychelles, and of course the  territories  of  France  in
the South West Indian Ocean, Réunion.

The region's people  are  dependent  to  a  significant  degree  on  coastal
resources. As far back as 1981, a UNEP fact-finding mission to  East  Africa
identified  large-scale  erosion,  oil  pollution,  damaged   coral   reefs,
pollution from fertilisers, and threats to precious marine animals as  major
environmental problems in the region. Since then the list of threats to  the
marine and coastal environment of the East  African  region  has  changed  a
little.
A workshop in 1997 confirmed that domestic  sewage,  solid  domestic  waste,
habitat degradation, agrochemical pollution and industrial  waste  pollution
posed great threats to the region. This area is particularly  vulnerable  to
oil pollution owing to the heavy use of the  tanker  route  along  the  East
African coast. On any given day, there  are  hundreds  of  tankers  in  this
region. In recent decades, the growth of industry has also brought about  an
increasing volume of effluents into coastal waters in the area.

The use  of  agricultural  chemicals  has  continued  to  grow,  and  sewage
treatment continues to be inadequate in many parts  of  this  region.  As  a
consequence of this, rivers, creeks and the sea have  become  dumping  sites
for industrial waste. Linked to industrialisation, the East  African  region
is also undergoing an extraordinary rate  of  urbanisation.  As  the  cities
have become overcrowded, water supplies have proved to be insufficient,  and
systems for drainage, sewerage and refuse disposal are also inadequate.

Domestic sewage is discharged directly into the rivers, and  in  some  cases
even into the sea. Some species of marine animals  are  already  endangered,
as a result of these human activities. Some people may say: ``So  what?  Why
should we be bothered about  the  degradation  of  the  marine  and  coastal
environment of these countries?'' The fact of the  matter  is  that  neither
marine pollution nor marine  resources  respect  geographical  or  political
boundaries.  Pollution  or  the  depletion  of  marine  resources   in   our
neighbouring states will have implications for us.

In the same way the pollution and depletion  of  our  own  marine  resources
will have serious  implications  for  people  living  in  the  East  African
coastal region, many of whom are dependent on  marine  resources  for  their
survival. It  is  therefore  in  our  interest  to  work  actively  and  co-
operatively with other countries in the region  to  ensure  the  sustainable
use of marine and coastal resources.

This convention is an ideal vehicle through which we as South  Africans  can
harmonise our own marine and  coastal  policies,  strategies  and  standards
with our East African neighbouring states, to ensure such  sustainable  use.
In the days and times of today, we have to rise up to  work  together,  with
our brothers, sisters and  children  of  the  continent  of  our  motherland
Africa.

The East African region has been neglected. Now is the time to put  life  in
our protocols, namely the Nairobi Convention. If I  may  borrow  the  Kenyan
word ``Harambee'', which means working  together,  I  therefore  appeal  for
harambee! Harambee! [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Thank  you,  hon
members. I know we will always  experience  a  few  mistakes.  This  time  I
wanted only delegation heads to vote. Fortunately all nine delegation  heads
voted in favour, but Mr Conroy, Mr Nel, and Mr Raju also voted.  [Laughter.]
Those votes will not be counted.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
                        AFFAIRS - ABIDJAN CONVENTION

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson and hon members, I want to read  a  statement  on
the Convention for Cooperation in the  Protection  and  Development  of  the
Marine and Coastal Environment of the  West  and  Central  African  Regions.
Much of what has been said with regard to the  Nairobi  Convention  is  also
true for the Abidjan Convention which seeks  to  establish  co-operation  in
the protection and development of  the  West  and  Central  African  coastal
region.

The Regional Seas Programme for West and Central Africa, was drafted in  the
early 1980s. The action plan and the Abidjan Convention were adopted by  the
governments in 1981. The convention entered into  force  in  1984  and  soon
projects on contingency planning, pollution, coastal erosion,  environmental
impact assessment, environmental legislation and marine  mammals  got  under
way. A number of difficulties, including competing priorities  and  lack  of
resources, resulted in slow progress from 1985 to 1999.

In recent decades, coastal eco-systems  have  suffered  greatly  from  rapid
development, improper use of resources and extensive pollution. Erosion  and
floods are  already  particular  problems.  This  is  likely  to  exacerbate
climate change. But, today the Abidjan convention is back on  track  holding
regular meetings and implementing its planned activities.

South Africa has much to  offer  in  terms  of  technical  knowledge  around
sustainable use of coastal  areas.  Over  the  past  seven  years,  we  have
implemented a number of policies and laws aimed at ensuring  more  effective
and efficient management of the coastal and marine eco-systems and  all  the
other natural resources in the country. This knowledge  can  greatly  assist
our brothers and sisters in the West and Central African coastal  region  in
their endeavours to promote  much-needed  social  and  economic  development
while preserving their natural habitat.

This Convention provides an ideal vehicle through which such  technical  co-
operation can be achieved. I believe that  this  offers  an  achievable  and
practical solution through which we as Africans  can  preserve  our  oceans,
which are our common heritage. I urge members to give the  Convention  their
endorsement.

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SERVICES - OPTIONAL
    PROTOCOL TO CONVENTION ON RIGHTS OF CHILD ON SALE OF CHILDREN, CHILD
                     PROSTITUTION AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY

Ms E C GOUWS: Mr  Chairperson,  hon  members,  only  recently  and  only  in
certain countries and cultures has the abuse of children come to be seen  as
a major social problem and a main cause of suffering and  personal  problems
for many people.

Children have been abused throughout human history, but for the  first  time
we are beginning to face the  true  prevalence  and  significance  of  child
abuse. Whilst I was sitting at Port Elizabeth airport  yesterday,  I  opened
the daily newspaper. The very first headline I  saw  informed  readers  that
two children were raped near King William's  Town.  An  eight-year-old  girl
was raped by a fourteen-year-old  youngster,  and  a  six-year-old  boy  was
raped by a 51-year-old man. How disgusting! How low can our moral  standards
drop or let me rather say: How cruel can society be?

The statistics on physical and  sexual  child  abuse  in  South  Africa  are
alarming. It is  estimated  that  hundreds  of  thousands  of  children  are
physically and sexually abused each year by a parent, a close  friend  or  a
relative. Many die. For those who survive the emotional trauma remains  long
after the external bruises have healed.  The  emotional  hidden  bruises  of
child abuse can be treated. Early recognition is important to  minimise  the
long-term effect of physical abuse.

Often the severe emotional damage to abused children does not  emerge  until
adolescence or later when many abused children  become  parents.  An  adult,
who was abused as a child, often has trouble establishing intimate  personal
relationships. Without proper treatment physically abused  children  can  be
damaged for life.

I want to state that there is concrete evidence to  confirm  a  strong  link
between the possession of child pornography and sexual abuse. In  fact,  87%
of perpetrators emulated pornographic scenes when raping their victims.  The
optional protocol to the convention on  the  rights  of  children  seeks  to
prevent child pornography, which means any representation by whatever  means
of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual  activities  or  the
representation of the sexual parts of a child. This has become a  matter  of
urgency. I would say that it is long overdue in these days  of  the  growing
availability of  child  pornography  on  the  Internet  and  other  evolving
technologies.

The above-mentioned protocol also discusses  child  prostitution,  which  is
the use of a child in  sexual  activities  for  remuneration.  There  are  a
number of particularly vulnerable groups, including girl  children  who  are
at greater risk of sexual exploitation. Factors contributing  to  this  evil
are lack of education, gender  discrimination,  irresponsible  adult  sexual
behaviour, armed conflict and trafficking in children.

We should all support the ratification of  this  optional  protocol  to  the
Convention on the Rights of the Child. South Africa needs this  desperately.
A strong legislative framework is required that has  the  child's  interests
at heart and that would prevent the  trauma  and  pain  which  children  are
subjected to.

All the examples mentioned are forms of child abuse, but in different  ways.
I really think there is an urgent need for a moral renewal  of  our  society
and a dire need to uplift women, and more especially children, so that  they
can be seen as equal human beings and not as possessions or  containers  for
some sick person's desires.

Let me say something about Rapcan, ie Resources Aimed at the  Prevention  of
Child Abuse and Neglect, which strives to protect children's  rights.  World
Day for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect on 19  November  of  every
year commemorates the ratification by the United  Nations  in  1989  of  the
Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Let  us  all  go  out  and  ask  our
communities and organisations to find ways in which  to  draw  attention  to
the abuse and neglect experienced  by  South  Africa  children.  This  is  a
malicious  cancer  and  a  threat  to  our  whole  nation  and  our  future.
[Applause.]

Mrs T E MILLIN (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, a lot of what I say will  sound
very similar to the previous speaker with regard to the  report  before  us,
on the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children,  Child
Prostitution and Child Pornography, all of  which  are  encompassed  by  the
generic term of child abuse, and which undoubtedly includes  the  widespread
rape of children.

Clearly, the intentions of this set of international protocols are  laudable
and all reasonable states and their law-abiding citizens would wish  to  see
such measures implemented and effectively used to combat the litany of  vile
wickedness that spreads like a gangrenous cancer  worldwide,  not  least  in
our own beloved, yet blighted land against  our  future  generations.  These
comprise so many, who through various forms of abuse have  had  what  should
have been happy carefree years of nurturing and child-like  innocence,  torn
asunder and brutally stolen from them, all too often  for  the  exploitation
and financial gain of adults who are a disgrace to humankind.

Yes, of course we need  to  subscribe  to  protocols  that  would  hopefully
prevent the horrendous rape of a nine-month-old baby or a six-year old  girl
left for dead after a rapist tore her so  badly  that  her  intestines  hung
between her emaciated legs like a red cauliflower. Both these  examples  are
well-documented, recent South African cases.

Of  course,  all  these  manifestations  of  child  abuse  and  particularly
pornography, which is arguable a logical progression  from  other  forms  of
pornography for lust-obsessed monsters seeking yet more kicks to feed  their
filthy habits, should and  must  be  abolished.  However,  given  the  track
record  of  countless  sessions,  conventions,   declarations   and   policy
statements on the rights of children in this instance  with  little  if  any
evidence of meaningful action, one can be forgiven for expressing a  healthy
dose of scepticism, or at least caution, at  the  prospect  of  yet  another
protocol.

The root cause of this terminal disease  in  society  is  that  mankind  has
become just too clever for its own good. So much so that we have turned  our
collective backs  on  Almighty  God,  rejecting  His  eternal  precepts  and
guidelines for our own pathetically puny  ones,  drifting  on  the  shifting
sands of  secular  relativism  which  rejects  such  ideals  as  discipline,
striving for excellence, the sanctity  of  marriage  between  a  man  and  a
woman, raising children in a safe, secure  and  loving  environment,  to  be
replaced with anarchistic urgings and an obsession  with  rights,  and  this
without much thought for responsibilities.  The  result  -  an  overwhelming
tidal wave of crime, gross violence and abuse of so many,  particularly  our
young ones.

We see children dying in large numbers from starvation, within  the  borders
of our country as referred to earlier by one of the motions. A country  that
can, nevertheless, afford to lavish hundreds of millions on UN-backed  World
Summits, not to mention billions on arms.

Should we really wonder why all this happens when we  pass  laws  legalising
such obscenities as abortion  on  demand,  which  involves  unborn  children
being indiscriminately ripped from their mothers' wombs, often by  reluctant
doctors  and  nurses  deeply  traumatised  by   having   to   perform   such
abominations according to man-made laws.  Should  we  wonder  that  we  have
become so desensitised and dehumanised when  we  are  engulfed  by  so  much
violent abuse? And yet, hope springs eternal and  so  one  hopes  that  this
protocol will not end up gathering dust in some  forgotten  archive.  May  I
quote:


  When the high and mighty gathered at the UN  General  Assembly's  special
  session, with the improbable acronym of Ungas, on children and produced a
  document entitled A world fit for children, setting targets  for  meeting
  their most pressing needs by 2012 and 2015, this session  was  hailed  by
  some as an indication of the increased seriousness with which  children's
  rights were been taken by the UN.

Maybe they are - on paper.


  But it is action and changed hearts alone that will turn the tide against
  the rottenness that eats of the core of mankind. The real  work  must  be
  done by activists. If one has a compassionate mind and strong  arms  then
  one can use these papers as a weapon, but one has to have the strong will
  of a fighter. Documents cannot liberate child slaves. It is  the  efforts
  of activists and the risks that they will take that set a child free.

I gratefully acknowledge the Children  First  publication  and  its  editor,
Cosmos Desmond, for the above quote. [Applause.]

Mnr F ADAMS: Mev die Voorsitter en agb lede, 'n  uitgebreide  internasionale
stel wetlike rigsnoere  oor  die  beskerming  en  welstand  van  kinders  is
eenparig by 'n  VN-kongres  oor  Kinderregte  aanvaar.  Die  Suid-Afrikaanse
Regering steun sedert 16 Junie 1995 die VN-kongres oor  Kinderregte  en  het
homself weer eens verbind tot die wetlike werktye wat  op  15  Mei  2002  in
werking gestel is. Derhalwe glo die Nuwe NP dat alles in  die  stryd  gewerp
moet word om elke kind teen mishandeling en uitbuiting te beskerm.

Belangrike aangeleenthede soos kinderprostitusie, pornografie en handel  met
kinders het tot dusver beslis nie die aandag  gekry  wat  dit  verdien  nie.
Daar is wêreldwyd 'n  aansienlike  toename  in  die  algemene  skending  van
kinderregte. Dit is van die uiterste belang dat 'n  wye  netwerk  van  lande
deel vorm  van  hierdie  poging  om  kinders  te  beskerm.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Mr  F  ADAMS:  Madam  Chairperson  and   hon   members,   a   comprehensive
international set of legal guidelines regarding the protection  and  welfare
of children has been unanimously accepted by a UN Conference on  the  Rights
of the Child. The South African Government has supported the  UN  Conference
on the Rights of the Child since 16 June 1995 and has once  again  committed
itself to the legal timeframes which became operative on 15  May  2002.  For
this reason the New NP believes that everything possible should be  done  to
protect every child from abuse and exploitation.

Important  matters  such  as  child  prostitution,  pornography  and   child
trafficking have thus far not received the attention they deserve. There  is
a considerable increase worldwide in the  general  violation  of  children's
rights. It is of the utmost importance that  a  wide  network  of  countries
form part of this effort to protect children.]

A wide variety of factors contribute to these practices,  such  as  lack  of
education,  urban-rural  migration,  gender  discrimination,   irresponsible
adult sexual behaviour, harmful traditional practices,  armed  conflict  and
trafficking in children. Sexual abuse of children  knows  no  boundaries  of
social class, race or  gender.  Conditions  of  abject  poverty  and  social
disintegration make children especially vulnerable  to  sexual  abuse.  With
the moral breakdown of society, the most vulnerable  in  society  thus  fall
victim to those people who have lost their  moral  bearing.  Social  factors
such as  overcrowding,  unemployment,  alcohol  abuse  and  broken  families
contribute to the problem of child abuse.

Certain policies developed in partnership with civil society are  not  being
effectively implemented.  The  New  NP  believes  that  there  should  be  a
stronger,  worldwide  call  for  the  criminalisation  of  the   production,
distribution, exportation, intentional possession and advertising  of  child
pornography ...

An HON MEMBER: Yes!

Mr F  ADAMS:  ...  stressing  the  importance  of  closer  co-operation  and
partnership between government  and  the  Internet  industry.  In  order  to
ensure that the protocol is a living document, each state shall, within  two
years following the coming into force  of  the  present  protocol  for  that
state, submit a report  to  the  Committee  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child,
providing  comprehensive  information  on  the  measures  it  has  taken  to
implement the provisions of the protocol.

The New  NP  trusts  that  this  protocol  will  really  contribute  to  the
implementation of those steps  that  will  ensure  a  better  life  for  all
children, not only our South African children, but  children  all  over  the
world. Children are our  most  valuable  resource  for  the  future  of  our
country and we need to ensure that they are given the best care,  attention,
protection and love so as to ensure that the future of the country  will  be
in the hands of responsible and caring adults. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SERVICES - PROTECTION
                     AND ADOPTION OF CHILDREN CONVENTION

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, the Select Committee on Social Services  believes
that the Convention on Protection of Children and  Co-operation  in  respect
of Inter-Country Adoption Office is a sufficient safeguard  to  ensure  that
the interests of the child in the case of inter-country  adoption  is  taken
into account. The committee has expressed concern at cases where a child  is
taken from South Africa and potentially abused in  the  receiving  state  by
the adoptive parents, that we have no  recourse  to  repatriate  that  child
since adoptions are permanent.

To a  certain  extent  our  fears  are  allayed  because  of  the  efficient
monitoring which, we believe, will be  done  between  our  country  and  the
receiving state. We also trust that the receiving state will have  stringent
human rights legislation for the protection of the rights of  children.  The
committee understands that this convention will help reduce the  horrors  of
kidnapping and trafficking in children which has increased in the  past  few
years in South Africa.

The Select  Committee  on  Social  Services  therefore  fully  supports  the
ratification of the Convention on Protection of  Children  and  Co-operation
in respect of Inter-Country Adoption. [Applause.]

1.    Report of  the  Select  Committee  on  Finance  on  Provincial  Public
     Hearings on FFC submission on Division of Revenue for 2003-04, dated 17
     September 2002:


     The Select Committee on Finance,  having  conducted  provincial  public
     hearings on the Financial and Fiscal  Commission's  submission  on  the
     Division of Revenue for 2003-04, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         On 29 April  2002,  the  Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission  (FFC),
         tabled its submission on the Division  of  Revenue  in  Parliament.
         The FFC has a legislative mandate of  advising  the  government  on
         the Division of Revenue among the national,  provincial  and  local
         spheres of government and making recommendations on provincial  and
         local fiscal matters.


         Pursuant to that, the Select Committee on Finance in  the  National
         Council of Provinces requested provinces to host their  own  public
         hearings to assist the  NCOP  in  drafting  a  consolidated  report
         based  on  information  acquired  from   such   provincial   public
         hearings.


         The  FFC's  mandate  is  to  make  submissions  to   the   national
         Parliament in terms of  section  9  the  Inter-Governmental  Fiscal
         Relations Act, 1997. In terms of the Act, the FFC has to make  this
         submission 10 months before the Minister of  Finance  presents  his
         Budget.  The  FFC  is  also  expected  to  assess   the   financial
         implications of new policies and to develop mechanisms  to  support
         the effective and efficient funding of these policies.  This  gives
         the Minister  of  Finance,  Parliament  and  other  stakeholders  a
         chance to debate, discuss and use  the  FFC's  recommendations  and
         proposals as  input  for  the  Minister's  budget  speech  and  the
         drawing up of the Budget itself.


         The Minister of Finance is obliged to consult with the FFC, but  is
         not compelled to incorporate the recommendations  into  the  budget
         speech. In  his  response  the  Minister  highlights  some  of  the
         concerns and issues that face the government with  respect  to  the
         equitable  share  and  inter-governmental  fiscal  relations.   The
         meetings with the Minister take place in December  and  January  in
         terms of the Inter-Governmental Fiscal Relations Act. The  Minister
         is obliged, in terms of that Act, to respond to the FFC  proposals.
         The formal response of the government is contained  in  the  Budget
         Review, submitted by the Minister on Budget Day.


         Section  214(2)  of  the  Constitution  states   that,   when   the
         recommendations of the FFC are considered,  the  following  factors
         (paragraphs (a) to (j) of the said  section)  must  be  taken  into
         account:


         (a)     The national interest


         (b)     Any provision that must be made in respect of the  national
              debt and other national obligations


         (c)      The  needs  and  interest  of  the   national   government
              determined by objective criteria


         (d)     The need to ensure that the  provinces  and  municipalities
              are able to provide basic services and perform  the  functions
              allocated to them


         (e)     The fiscal capacity and efficiency  of  the  provinces  and
              the municipalities


         (f)      Developmental  and  other  needs   of   provinces,   local
              government and municipalities


         (g)     Economic disparities within and among the provinces


         (h)     Obligations of the provinces and  municipalities  in  terms
              of national legislation


         (i)     The desirability of stable and predictable  allocations  of
              revenue shares


         (j)     The need for flexibility in responding  to  emergencies  or
              other temporary needs, and  other  factors  based  on  similar
              objective criteria.


         The recommendations are also informed by request the FFC gets  from
         other stakeholders.


     B.     FFC recommendations for 2002-03


         The nature of  the  FFC  proposals  was  within  the  framework  of
         proposals it had made for the MTEF cycle in 2000. Annual  proposals
         have to be made for the next fiscal year within that cycle.


         1. Provincial government proposals


              (a) HIV/AIDS and ECD


                  The FFC proposes that conditional grants remain  the  most
                  appropriate  mechanism  for  targeting  the  spending   of
                  HIV/AIDS funds, and that ECD should be  funded  through  a
                  conditional grant until it can be  incorporated  into  the
                  equitable share. The  conditional  grants  in  respect  of
                  HIV/AIDS  should,  therefore,  not  be  included  in   the
                  equitable   share,   since   the   equitable   share    is
                  unconditional and it will be difficult to track funding.


                  The FFC proposes the development of a  suitable  data  and
                  information base in order for HIV/AIDS to be prioritised.


              (b) With regard to own revenue, provinces  can  generate  this
                  through:


                  *    Road traffic revenue


                  *    Hospital and patient fees


                  *    Horse-racing and gambling.


              (c) The Provincial Tax Regulation Process Bill should:


                  *    Specify  criteria  against  which  the  Minister  can
                       measure provincial tax proposals


                  *    Clarify the implications and procedures  relating  to
                       capacity limitations of SARS


                  *    Allow provinces maximum  flexibility  in  determining
                       tax rates within tax rate bands


                  *    Include  guidelines  with  regard  to  tax  room  and
                       equalisation  measures,  where  certain  taxes   have
                       implications for the equitable share revenue pool


                  *      Specify   regulations   for   dispute   resolution,
                       especially  where  a  province  may  fail  to   reach
                       agreement with SARS on certain tax proposals.


                  The FFC submission suggests that there  are  possibilities
                  for  improvement   relating   to   financial   management,
                  appropriate revision of fees and incentive structures.


         2. Local government proposals


              (a) Municipal borrowing and finance markets


                  There should be a combination of market discipline  and  a
                  rules-based approach.  The  government  should  set  rules
                  that  will  ensure  that   borrowers   and   lenders   are
                  adequately protected.


                  There  should  also  be  a  differentiated   approach   to
                  municipalities   and    policy    measures    to    assist
                  municipalities to build their credit-worthiness.


              (b) Primary health care


                  The  FFC  supports  the   recommendation   that   district
                  municipalities  should  be  the  service  authorities   in
                  respect of health care.  It  also  recommends  that  local
                  municipalities should be the main service delivery  agents
                  and authorities for water and sanitation, unless there  is
                  no capacity.


              (c) Councillors' remuneration


                  On the contentious  issue  of  councillors'  remuneration,
                  the FFC states that  constitutionally  councillors  should
                  be  remunerated  from  municipal  revenue.  However,   the
                  institutional component of the local government  equitable
                  share should  be  assessed  to  ensure  that  it  reflects
                  existing  legislative  requirements   (i.e.   departmental
                  guidelines on upper limits of councillor remuneration).


              (d) Restructuring of electricity


                  On the restructuring of electricity distribution, the  FFC
                  proposes  that,  from   the   six   regional   electricity
                  distributors  (REDS)  to  be  formed,  their   demarcation
                  should be conterminous  with  municipal  boundaries.  This
                  will  ensure  that  two  people  living  within  the  same
                  municipality will not be paying different tariff rates.


                  There should be a national tariff  support  programme  for
                  low-income consumers  through  lifeline  tariffs  or  free
                  basic services.


                  There  should  be  compensation  to   municipalities   for
                  transfer-related losses. About 6% of municipal revenue  is
                  collected in respect of electricity.


         3. Cross-cutting equitable share proposals


              (a) Disaster management funding


                  The FFC  proposes  that  central  funding  mechanisms  for
                  disaster management should be introduced so as  to  ensure
                  that   budget   frameworks    and    the    delivery    of
                  constitutionally-mandated basic services  (CMBS)  are  not
                  compromised.
                  The FFC proposes that once  provinces  and  municipalities
                  exceed  a  prescribed  threshold  of  their   budgets   on
                  emergency  response,  funding  should  kick  in  from  the
                  central  contingency  reserve.  For  municipalities,  this
                  prescribed  threshold  would  take   account   of   fiscal
                  capacity.


              (b) Contingency reserve


                  The FFC proposes that more defined objective  criteria  be
                  provided to guide the purpose of the contingency fund.


                  The contingency reserve should be set aside for  emergency
                  response  efforts   for   all   spheres   of   government.
                  Furthermore, the FFC suggests that  the  two  purposes  of
                  the contingency reserve  should  be  separated  (i.e.  new
                  spending priorities of the outer years  of  the  MTEF  and
                  one for emergencies dealing with  macroeconomic  stability
                  and responses to natural or human made disasters).
              (c) Social security


                  The FFC proposes that  old-age  and  veteran  pensions  be
                  budgeted for and administered by the national government.


                  The FFC also proposes that a national security  agency  be
                  established to  deal  with  problems  in  repsect  of  the
                  delivery of  social  security  programmes.  Its  main  aim
                  would be to improve access to, as well as  efficiency  and
                  effectiveness of, service  delivery  with  regard  to  the
                  poorest of the poor.


              (d) Review of current equitable share formulae


                  The 2004-05 financial year begins the new MTEF cycle.  All
                  stakeholders (e.g.  the  government  and  Parliament)  are
                  required to apply their minds to reviewing  the  equitable
                  share formula.


                  The  FFC  proposes  that  the  mechanism  of  distributing
                  nationally collected revenue should introduce a  principle
                  of balancing the requirements of the Bill  of  Rights  for
                  the delivery of constitutionally-mandated  basic  services
                  (CMBS) with the constraints contained  in  section  214(2)
                  of the Constitution (see paragraph A. above).


                  It  also  mentions  the  need  for  improvement   in   the
                  collection  of  data  to  enhance   the   development   of
                  intergovernmental  fiscal   mechanisms   consistent   with
                  constitutional requirements.


     C.     Responses of provinces to recommendations


         1. The review of the equitable  division  of  revenue  should  take
              into account the  Census  2001  data.  When  allocating  funds
              between  the  different   spheres   of   government,   poverty
              alleviation and economic development  should  be  prioritised,
              based  on  population  density  informed  by  the  soon-to-be-
              released new Census data.
         2. The RED boundaries should be aligned with  municipal  boundaries
              to ensure that residents of a given municipality do  not  fall
              within  different  REDs  and  hence  under  different   tariff
              structures.


         3. Metro or urban municipalities rely on electricity as  their  key
              rates collector for own revenue  for  solvency.  The  move  to
              compensate such municipalities for the losses  that  might  be
              caused by the transfer to RED's is welcomed.


         4. Greater emphasis should be placed on  needs  and  cost  recovery
              issues.


         5. The current arrangements for disaster funding are  unstructured.
              The funding of disaster response efforts should be drawn  from
              the contingency reserve,  once  provinces  and  municipalities
              have exceeded a given proportion of their budgets on  response
              efforts.


         6. Councillors should be  remunerated  through  municipal  revenues
              (including their equitable share  allocation).  Municipalities
              would like to receive increased equitable shares to  speed  up
              service delivery in those municipalities who cannot afford  to
              raise their own revenue and also to help with  the  adjustment
              of councillors' remuneration.


     D.     Committee conclusions and recommendations


         1. Provinces supporting the phasing out of conditional  grants  are
              not in agreement with the FFC's proposal on HIV/AIDS.


         2. The development of specific inter-governmental fiscal  capacity-
              building programmes should be accelerated and funds  initially
              transferred through equitable division of revenue should  also
              be supported by specific conditional grants.


         3. The functions and powers related to the distribution  of  social
              grants must remain with the  provinces.  Capacity  constraints
              exist at national, provincial and local level.


         4. The provincial tax assignment issue is still unresolved  because
              of its complexity. A surcharge on  PIT  needs  to  be  debated
              because most provinces disagree on this arrangement.

3.    Report of the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional  Affairs
     on European Convention on Extradition, dated 21 August 2002:
         The  Select  Committee  on  Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,
         having considered the request for approval  by  Parliament  of  the
         European Convention on  Extradition,  referred  to  it,  recommends
         that the Council, in terms of section 231(2) of  the  Constitution,
         approve the said Convention, with the declaration that:


         (1)     the Republic of South Africa, for the purposes  of  Article
              2 of the Convention, shall not extradite any person unless the
              punishment awarded for a conviction in respect of which he  or
              she is being sought, is a sentence of imprisonment of at least
              six months; and


         (2)     for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention,  the  term
              "nationals" is defined,  in  terms  of  South  Africa's  legal
              system, as persons who have acquired South African citizenship
              by means of birth, descent or  naturalisation.  This  includes
              persons with  citizenship  of  South  Africa  and  of  another
              country. These persons will all be liable  to  be  extradited.
              South Africa's acceptance of dual citizenship  will  therefore
              not bar the extradition of a person where he or she is also in
              possession of a citizenship of a country which  prohibits  the
              extradition of its nationals.

7.    Report of the Select Committee on Land and  Environmental  Affairs  on
     International Study Tour to Malaysia, dated 6 September 2002:


     The  Select  Committee  on  Land  and  Environmental  Affairs,   having
     undertaken a study tour to Malaysia from 1 to 6 July 2002,  reports  as
     follows:


     A.     Terms of Reference


         It is parliamentary policy to provide opportunities for Members  of
         Parliament to develop skills, knowledge and competencies  in  order
         to perform their duties efficiently and effectively.


         In the light of this policy  guideline,  the  Committee,  which  is
         responsible for the portfolios of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs,
         Water Affairs and Forestry as well  as  Environmental  Affairs  and
         Tourism, resolved to undertake a study tour to  Malaysia  in  order
         to  gain  knowledge  of  how  a  country  at  a  similar  stage  of
         development as South Africa was dealing with  problems  encountered
         in the fields of Agriculture, Fishing, Agro-Tourism  and  technical
         co-operation with other developing countries.


         Whilst South Africa has advanced rapidly with regard to policy  and
         legislation in the sectors that are of concern  to  the  Committee,
         the problems of emerging farmers and small-scale fishers  have  yet
         to  be  addressed.  Malaysia  has  worked  effectively   within   a
         sustainable development framework to  overcome  problems  in  these
         sectors, and South Africa  has  important  lessons  to  learn  from
         their initiatives.
     B.     Background


         Malaysia is located in  the  heart  of  South-East  Asia,  slightly
         north of the equator. It consists of  330,200  square  km,  and  is
         divided into two main regions -  Peninsular  Malaysia,  which  lies
         just south of Thailand, and East  Malaysia,  which  lies  north  of
         Indonesia. These two regions are divided into 13 states.


         Although East Malaysia is  the  larger  segment,  it  is  primarily
         comprised of undeveloped land and  jungles.  Approximately  80%  of
         the  country's  more  than  24  million  people  occupy  the   main
         peninsula.


         The  territories  making  up  the  modern  Malaysia  were   British
         protectorates during the 1920s. Malaysian nationalism came  to  the
         fore in the 1930s and in  the  period  after  World  War  II.  This
         eventually  culminated  in  the  formation  of  the  Federation  of
         Malaysia in 1957, which became Malaysia in 1963.


         Since independence,  the  country  has  developed  rapidly  and  is
         aiming at first-world status by 2020.


         The diverse cultural and racial  groups  comprising  the  Malaysian
         nation are reminiscent of South Africa's cultural diversity.


         In  the  field  of  Agriculture,  the   Malaysian   Department   of
         Agriculture  has  introduced  various   types   of   projects   and
         activities to increase  the  income  of  Malaysian  farmers.  Group
         farming projects and women's extension group projects are of  great
         importance here.


         With respect to fishing, ventures in aquaculture are of  particular
         interest,  with  technical  and  extension  services  as  well   as
         training  programmes  being  made  available  by  the  State.   The
         services  promote  the  development  of  a  modern  and   efficient
         industry with well-trained and skilled manpower.


         The  Department  of  Agriculture  also  introduced  the   idea   of
         incorporating tourism  with  small-scale  agricultural  activities.
         This goes a long way to increasing the income of farmers.


         The Malaysian Technical Co-operation Programme (MTCP) was  launched
         in 1980 to promote  technical  co-operation  between  Malaysia  and
         other developing countries. The programme organises  technical  co-
         operation activities on a systematic and sustained basis.


         The Committee  set  its  objectives  for  the  study  tour  as  the
         investigation of the above-mentioned important fields.


     C.     Procedure


         The Malaysian government assisted the  Committee  in  reaching  its
         objectives by drawing up a programme that included  visits  to  the
         sites of aquaculture, group  farming  ventures,  women's  extension
         group projects and agro-tourism ventures.


         Important briefings were also given on the  Malaysian  economy  and
         the Third National Agricultural Policy, which formed  the  backdrop
         against which the various projects could be understood.


         Information on the MTCP was also made available to the Committee.


         The multi-party delegation consisted of  Rev  P  Moatshe,  Ms  B  N
         Dlulane, Mr V V Z Windvoël, Mr A E van Niekerk and Mr R M  Nyakane.
         The  Committee  Secretary,  Mr  K  Williams,   was   also   present
         throughout.


     D.     Findings


         1.  Briefing  on  Malaysian  Economy  (Development  Philosophy  and
              Policy) - Putrajaya, 2 July 2002


              Mr Adzmy Abdullah, a member of the Economic Planning  Unit  in
              the  Prime  Minister's  Department,  conducted  the  briefing.
              Although  this  was  the  second  briefing  received  by   the
              delegation, it will be dealt with first as  it  contains  many
              key concepts that explain the Malaysian government's  approach
              to development.


              (a) Development planning in Malaysia


                  Mr Abdullah  pointed  out  that  development  planning  in
                  Malaysia was based on a  mixed  economic  system  of  free
                  enterprise with active government support  and  direction.
                  The  government  provides  the  broad  thrusts  and   sets
                  direction  for  the  whole  economy,   and   ensures   the
                  achievement of socio-economic goals. On  the  other  hand,
                  the private sector is free  to  operate  and  is  provided
                  with     appropriate     policy,     institutional     and
                  infrastructural support. What is aimed at is a  system  of
                  co-operation  between  the  government  and  the   private
                  sector towards the creation  of  a  Malaysian  company  to
                  achieve progress and shared benefits.


                  Structural  mechanisms  to  achieve  the  above  included,
                  amongst others, the Malaysian Business Council,  dialogues
                  with the private sector and the  privatisation  programme.
                  Needless to say, the development aims cannot  be  achieved
                  if the private sector is not patriotic and progressive.


                  Since independence in 1957, there have been  a  number  of
                  major economic policies. The first period of  significance
                  was from 1957 to 1970. This could be viewed  as  the  pre-
                  New Economic Policy period. It was  marked  by  a  laissez
                  faire approach and was dominated by production for  export
                  of mono-crops.


                  The New Economic Policy (NEP) was  implemented  from  1971
                  to  1990.  It  aimed  at  growth   with   equity   between
                  Malaysia's racial groups and set the country on  the  path
                  to development. The major goal was national  unity  within
                  the context of an expanding economy. The major  strategies
                  of  this  period   were   the   reduction   and   ultimate
                  eradication of poverty among Malaysians,  irrespective  of
                  race or ethnic roots, and restructuring Malaysian  society
                  to correct economic imbalances  so  as  to  eliminate  the
                  identification of race with economic function.


                  Vision 2020 covers the entire period from  1991  to  2020,
                  and  is  aimed  at  the  total  development  of  Malaysian
                  society, with the aim of bringing the country on par  with
                  developed nations.


                  The first half of Vision 2020 covers  the  years  1991  to
                  2000 and is called the National Development Policy  (NDP).
                  In this period, balanced  development  between  the  urban
                  and rural sectors is stressed, with industrial  production
                  beginning to overhaul agricultural production.  The  chief
                  goal of the period is a united  and  just  society  again,
                  within  the  context  of  an  expanding   economy.   Major
                  strategies for the period are again poverty reduction  and
                  eventual elimination together with  the  restructuring  of
                  society.


                  In  order  to  achieve  balanced  development,   the   NDP
                  encompasses the following critical aspects:


                  *    Optimum balance between economic growth and equity


                  *    Greater material welfare imbued with positive  social
                       and spiritual values


                  *      Balanced   regional   development   for    national
                       integration


                  *    Balanced development of major sectors


                  *    Human resource development


                  *    Development and protection  of  the  environment  and
                       ecology.


                  The years 2001-10 are  governed  by  the  National  Vision
                  Policy (NVP) that has the theme of  building  a  resilient
                  and  competitive  nation.  The  overriding  objective   is
                  national unity with the aim of establishing a  progressive
                  and prosperous Malaysian nation.  The  key  strategies  of
                  the   NEP   and   the   NDP   (eradicating   poverty   and
                  restructuring  society,  as  well  as  ensuring   balanced
                  development) are maintained with new dimensions.


                  The overall strategy for Vision 2020 is total  development
                  (i.e. economically,  politically,  socially,  spiritually,
                  psychologically and culturally). The  aim  is  to  improve
                  the quality of life and standard  of  living  to  reach  a
                  level enjoyed by other  developed  countries.  To  achieve
                  this, an annual average  output  growth  of  7%  with  low
                  inflation is aimed at. Furthermore,  there  should  be  an
                  eight-fold increase in GDP and  a  four-fold  increase  in
                  per capita income.


              (b) Agricultural development planning


                  The general objective here is the maximisation  of  income
                  through the  optimisation  of  resources  in  the  sector.
                  Although Agriculture's contribution to the  economy  as  a
                  percentage of GDP dropped from 10,3% in 1995  to  8,8%  in
                  2000, the agricultural sector as a whole grew by 1,2%  per
                  annum from 1996 to  2000.  Furthermore,  it  was  expected
                  that the sector would grow by 2,9% per annum from 2001  to
                  2005. Therefore, despite  the  growth  of  the  industrial
                  sector, agriculture's importance had not diminished.


                  The main thrust  in  agriculture  from  2001  to  2005  is
                  transforming  the  sector  to  be  modern,   dynamic   and
                  competitive, in line with  the  strategies  of  the  Third
                  National  Agricultural  Policy  (NAP3),  particularly   to
                  increase food  production  and  to  contribute  to  export
                  earnings.


                  In order to achieve these goals, the following  strategies
                  have been outlined:


                  For agricultural industrial commodities


                  *    Consolidating oil  palm  hectarage  and  establishing
                       Malaysian standards and brand


                  *      Reorientating   rubber   cultivation   through   an
                       integrated planting system and the creation of rubber
                       forests


                  *    Utilising natural resources on  a  sustainable  basis
                       and promoting linkages with other activities such  as
                       manufacturing, eco- and agro-tourism


                  For food production


                  *    Expanding food production areas


                  *    Intensifying aquaculture development


                  *    Intensifying land use through integration


                  *    Promoting cost- and  labour-saving  technologies,  as
                       well as intensifying  research  and  development  and
                       downstream processing


                  For new sources of growth


                  *    Developing speciality natural  products,  other  non-
                       timber  forest  products,   biotechnology   products,
                       floriculture and ornamental fish as  new  sources  of
                       growth


                  The sector could also be strengthened by


                  *    Strengthening human resource development


                  *    Strengthening  support  services  and  improving  the
                       delivery mechanism


                  *    Undertaking measures  to  increase  accessibility  of
                       credit as well as introducing insurance coverage  and
                       services.


              (c) Response to questions


                  In  response  to  questions  from  the   delegation,   the
                  following points were raised:


                  *    The government was able to  implement  its  grandiose
                       plans by consulting with all stakeholders. People  on
                       the street  were  encouraged  to  give  their  views,
                       either directly  or  through  their  representatives.
                       Furthermore, the government has  a  track  record  of
                       working for the good of  the  people,  and  political
                       stability has enabled people to work together for the
                       common  good.  National  unity  has  been   preserved
                       through the abolishing of economic "apartheid".
                       The private sector has been taken on board and  their
                       comments and feedback is welcomed. Expropriation  has
                       been made  unnecessary  through  the  growth  of  the
                       economic cake.


                       National consensus was achieved through the  National
                       Consultative Council  of  1990,  which  included  all
                       political  parties,  trade  unions,  NGOs   and   the
                       chambers of commerce.


                       All  of  the  country's  mass  media  were  used   to
                       popularise the developmental programmes.


                  *    A multi-dimensional strategy was used to correct  the
                       imbalances between urban and rural  areas.  Education
                       was made accessible to all rural  persons,  and  once
                       they  were  educated,  they   were   guaranteed   job
                       security. The rural landless were also  resettled  on
                       economically  viable  land  and  encouraged  to  grow
                       commercial crops for profit.


                  *    The  government  and  the  private  sector  can  work
                       together on a "win-win"  basis  because  the  private
                       sector works to achieve national objectives.


         2. Briefing  on  Third  National  Agricultural  Policy  (1998-2010)
              (NAP3) - Wisma Tani, 2 July 2002


              Mr Foo of the Ministry of Agriculture conducted the briefing.


              (a) Introduction


                  It was pointed out that NAP3 was  a  continuation  of  the
                  previous two national agricultural policies. Its main  aim
                  was to maximise the use of the country's land resources.


                  The vision for agriculture under this policy  is  that  it
                  should be an engine for growth, it should  be  competitive
                  in the world market and it should turn the country into  a
                  prominent food producer.


              (b) Policy direction


                  The aims of the third national policy  would  be  achieved
                  by enhancing production and deepening linkages with  other
                  sectors such as industry. Here  it  was  anticipated  that
                  agricultural products would be  processed  before  export,
                  rather  than  having  the  raw  product  exported  without
                  beneficiation.


                  New frontier areas would be ventured into and there  would
                  be a conscious effort to conserve  natural  resources  and
                  utilise them on a sustainable basis.


                  New  features  of  the   Third   Policy   would   be   the
                  encouragement of large-scale ventures that  would  benefit
                  from the economies of scale. Mechanisation would  also  be
                  encouraged to  improve  efficiency  and  to  overcome  the
                  labour shortage. To this end, farming that was technology-
                  based and knowledge-intensive would be stressed.


                  Private sector  participation  would  be  encouraged,  but
                  support  services  in   the   fields   of   research   and
                  development, marketing and financing would be provided  by
                  the State. These would be strengthened.


                  The State would also undertake human resource  development
                  in order  to  raise  the  skills  levels  of  farmers  and
                  agricultural workers.


                  Agro-Tourism would be expanded.


              (c) Priority projects


                  Certain projects would be regarded as  priorities  on  the
                  basis of certain criteria:


                  *    They should be competitive and commercially viable


                  *    They should reduce imports and increase exports


                  *    They should provide food security


                  *    They  should  be  less  vulnerable  to  severe  price
                       changes


                  *    They should attract private sector participation


                  *    They should be less labour intensive


                  *    They should be environmentally sustainable.


                  The priority products identified are  all  food  products,
                  in line with  the  aim  of  achieving  food  security.  In
                  addition to this, the production  of  exotic  flowers  and
                  ornamental fish is encouraged, as  they  are  huge  export
                  earners.


              (d) Strategic thrusts


                  Large-scale farming with modern techniques  is  encouraged
                  to enhance productivity and efficiency.


                  Integrated,  mixed  farming  activities  are  stressed  in
                  order to make the most efficient use of land resources.


                  Food production is emphasised in the three sub-sectors  of
                  food crops, fisheries and livestock production.


                  In line with the above, incentives  in  the  form  of  tax
                  reductions  are  given  to  enterprises  engaged  in  food
                  production.


                  Private sector participation is  encouraged  in  order  to
                  free up state funds  for  strengthening  support  services
                  and investing in  other  spheres  such  as  education  and
                  health.


                  The consultative and collaborative mechanism  between  the
                  public and private sector is further strengthened  through
                  the  establishment  of   a   Private-Public   Sector   Co-
                  ordination Council.


                  The Business Development Centre assists  with  information
                  on investment opportunities and good business practices.


                  Regular  investment  seminars  are  held  at  which   good
                  investment opportunities are identified.


                  The State  further  creates  an  enabling  environment  by
                  intensifying  research  and  development,   by   providing
                  extension    services,    warehousing    facilities    and
                  distribution  networks,  and  by  providing  finance   and
                  information.


                  Agro-technology parks will be developed  to  promote  high
                  technology agricultural production systems by the  private
                  sector.  Such  production   systems   involve   mechanised
                  operations,  precision  control  of  inputs  and   growing
                  environment,  production  of  quality   and   high   value
                  products  such  as  fruits,  vegetables,  aquarium   fish,
                  flowers, fishery and livestock products.


                  The  transfer  of  technology  is  encouraged  to   ensure
                  automisation   and   mechanisation,    production    under
                  controlled environments, integrated  pest  management  and
                  the quality of seeds and breeder stock.


                  Communication   programmes   would   be   launched,   both
                  internally and externally, to promote  Malaysian  products
                  at home and abroad in order to limit imports and  increase
                  exports.


              (e) Response to questions


                  Questions  posed  by  members  of  the   delegation   were
                  numerous and varied. Some of the most important  responses
                  were the following:


                  *    Upstream products are products in their  crude  form,
                       while the refined product is regarded as a downstream
                       product.  Malaysia  was  aiming  at  the  export   of
                       downstream products  which  are  less  vulnerable  to
                       price fluctuations.


                  *    Government policy is to encourage large companies  to
                       practice mixed farming by introducing cattle  on  the
                       palm-oil  estates.  So   far,   results   have   been
                       disappointing.


                  *    At grass-roots level, the  State  provides  extension
                       services by which farmers are trained in the  use  of
                       more sophisticated technology. This enables  them  to
                       be more productive and to graduate  from  subsistence
                       farmers to entrepreneurs.


                  On a higher level, some farmers are  brought  to  training
                  institutes at the State's expense  and  they  graduate  as
                  fully-fledged agronomists.


                  *    Agro-tourism initially started in  the  marine  parks
                       that were developed for conservation and tourism. The
                       concept has, however, been extended to ordinary farms
                       where the tourist gains experience by living with the
                       indigenous family.


                  *    Malaysia attempts to off-set the  cost  of  importing
                       certain crops that it cannot grow by  exporting  more
                       of those crops that grow well in the country.


                  *    Malaysia  has  about  85  000  fisher  folk  who  are
                       granted one-year licences to fish. The government  is
                       trying to reduce this  number  so  that  participants
                       will get a bigger  slice  of  the  cake  and  thereby
                       improve their income. More efficient catching methods
                       are also encouraged with this aim in mind.


                  A system of different zones for  different  categories  of
                  fishers ensures that the smaller fishers do  not  have  to
                  compete with the bigger companies in the same areas.


                  Enforcement teams check on zoning and curb  poaching  with
                  the help of the navy and air  force.  Misdemeanours  could
                  result in the confiscation of the boats involved.


                  *    The Agricultural Bank provides soft  loans  for  food
                       production projects and to those farmers  wishing  to
                       expand their  activities  from  a  subsistence  to  a
                       commercial level.


                       Group farming is encouraged. The government  provides
                       grants initially, but later credit is obtained on the
                       basis of the group's own resources.  Group  marketing
                       also  occurs,  and  in  this  way  farmers  learn  to
                       commercialise and become entrepreneurs.


                  *    Malaysia aims at limiting price fluctuations for  its
                       products, but this is very difficult and has not  yet
                       been achieved. A positive measure,  however,  is  the
                       limiting of intermediaries in the marketing chain.


                  Some  of  Malaysia's  primary  products  are  affected  by
                  subsidies in the developed world. The only  solution  here
                  is  to  participate   in   negotiations   aimed   at   the
                  eradication of these subsidies.


                  *    Aquaculture  is  the  answer  to  diminishing  marine
                       resources, and is growing  rapidly  in  Malaysia.  It
                       must, however, be practised in a sustainable manner.
                  *    Although Agriculture's share of  GDP  is  decreasing,
                       the sector is still growing and  is  viewed  as  very
                       important, especially for the production of food.


                  *    Malaysia has a good record  of  poverty  alleviation,
                       and a high incidence of poverty has been  reduced  to
                       insignificant proportions. Projects and  schemes  for
                       people in rural areas have played  a  role  here,  as
                       have the attempts to  curb  inflation  and  keep  the
                       price of essential  items  low  and  controlled.  The
                       country  is  now  concentrating  on  more   efficient
                       production, which will ensure access  to  food  at  a
                       reasonable price.


         3. Aquaculture in Malaysia


              (a) Overview


                  Production  from  aquaculture  is  not   very   large   in
                  Malaysia, due to the fact that the industry is  relatively
                  young, having just started in the  early  1930s  with  the
                  introduction of freshwater fish  culture.  Brackish  water
                  culture came in later  with  the  introduction  of  shrimp
                  farming, using  trapping  ponds  in  mangrove  areas,  and
                  cockle culture in mud flats in the late 1930s  and  1940s,
                  respectively.


                  In the seventies came the culture  of  marine  finfish  in
                  floating net-cages and the culture of green mussels  using
                  floating rafts.


                  In the eighties  and  nineties,  the  industry  picked  up
                  considerably, with great emphasis given to the  sector  by
                  the   government.   There   was   also   involvement    by
                  entrepreneurs and  the  corporate  sector  in  large-scale
                  shrimp farming and  freshwater  fish  culture  on  a  more
                  intensive scale.


                  The aquarium fish  industry  also  developed  rapidly.  In
                  recent years, interest in the  culture  of  other  aquatic
                  species such as freshwater turtle, frogs,  crocodiles  and
                  seaweed also emerged.


                  The  aquaculture  industry  provides  employment  to  some
                  18 143 people  and  numerous  others  engaged  in  related
                  activities such as harvesting, processing and marketing.


                  The bulk of employment generated is in rural  and  coastal
                  areas and this helps with provision of gainful  employment
                  in those  areas.  It  also  provides  an  avenue  for  the
                  redeployment  of  fishermen  from   the   over-capitalised
                  inshore fisheries,  thus  reducing  the  pressure  on  the
                  coastal fish stocks.


                  Aquaculture  plays  an  important  role  in   contributing
                  towards  food  supply  and  will  play   an   increasingly
                  important role  in  the  future  to  meet  the  increasing
                  demand for protein, both in the low-priced as well as  the
                  high-priced categories.


                  Freshwater fish from aquaculture is  especially  important
                  in  the  rural  hinterland  areas  where  marine  fish  is
                  generally not available. Moreover, with the  depletion  of
                  the coastal fish stocks through  over-exploitation,  there
                  is  a  growing  expectation  of  aquaculture  playing   an
                  increasingly dominant role in fish production.


                  The aquarium fish  industry  took  off  on  a  significant
                  scale only in the 1980s with the  establishment  of  farms
                  especially in Johore, Perak, Selangor  and  Penang.  Prior
                  to this, it was more of a backyard activity.


                  By 1992 there was a total of  336  farms  engaged  in  the
                  production of ornamental fishes,  natural  or  live  feed,
                  pelleted feed, aquarium accessories and aquatic plants.


                  Malaysia has made considerable inroads in  the  production
                  of ornamental fish with a number of notable successes.


                  Under  NAP3,  aquaculture  is  designated   to   play   an
                  important role  to  cater  for  the  expanding  local  and
                  foreign   markets,   with   development   undertaken    in
                  sustainable manner.  In  line  with  this,  a  perspective
                  development plan up to the year 2010  has  been  drawn  up
                  for aquaculture.


                  The plan envisages the  gradual  increase  in  aquaculture
                  production from the current  80  000  tonnes  to  200  000
                  tonnes by the year 2010. This represents  an  increase  of
                  120 000 tonnes or a 150% increase over the period.


                  The aquarium fish industry is also targeted to  accelerate
                  its development several-fold to 470 million fish.


                  A master plan detailing the various action  programmes  is
                  being drawn  up  to  facilitate  the  smooth  and  orderly
                  development of the industry as planned.


                  The  provision  of  fiscal  and  financial  incentives  is
                  deemed necessary to stimulate investment in  the  industry
                  by both local and foreign entrepreneurs.


              (b) Visits to sites of aquaculture


                  *    Fish Hatchery Project - Three Ocean Company


                       This is a private  venture  that  has  grown  from  a
                       family business to a lucrative  enterprise  employing
                       eight people, including the family.


                       Although the owner was  non-committal  about  profits
                       obtained, the four vehicles on site did indicate that
                       sizeable profits were being made.


                       The owner, Mr See Kong  King,  claimed  that  he  had
                       received training in breeding for one week in Taiwan.


                       There  were  about  50  tanks  for  the  hatching  of
                       catfish. These fish are sold for about 8RM when  they
                       attain a weight of one kg. Fry  are  also  sold  when
                       they attain a length of approximately one inch.


                       Brood stock is also kept in nets in a big  dam.  They
                       are fed high protein feed to encourage them to  spawn
                       and excess eggs are sold to other hatchers.


                       Freshwater shrimp are found in another of the dams on
                       the farm. These occur  naturally  and  are  used  for
                       feed. The excess is again sold to other farms.


                       Ponds were formed in the holes  left  by  tin  mining
                       activities in former years.


                       Some ornamental fish are being produced and this is a
                       very lucrative activity. It is not the main focus  of
                       the project, however.


                       The presence of ducks on the farm indicated a move to
                       integrated farming, in line with  government  policy.
                       At  this  stage,  however,  the  ducks  were   merely
                       providing additional food for the family on the farm.


                  *    Aquarium Farm Project - San Sui Tropical


                       This was also a private venture that had grown from a
                       family business into a lucrative enterprise. Its main
                       concern was the trade in ornamental fish.


                       Although some breeding was done on site, the  concern
                       mainly buys in small ornamental  fish,  raises  them,
                       and then  sells  them  to  a  worldwide  market  that
                       includes the USA, Australia  and  Germany.  Trade  in
                       ornamental fish is a  multi-million  dollar  industry
                       and is considered  to  be  a  most  important  growth
                       sector for aquaculture.


                       The site consists  of  a  warehouse  with  about  100
                       oxygenated   tanks   containing   approximately   100
                       varieties of ornamental fish. There are also about 50
                       ponds for larger fish that are  not  suited  for  the
                       tanks.


                       15 workers are employed and, although no figures were
                       discussed, they seem to make a good livelihood.


                       There was clearly a  good  relationship  between  the
                       owner   and   the   government   representative   who
                       accompanied  the  delegation.   State   intervention,
                       however,  is   minimal   and   consists   mainly   of
                       popularising what is  clearly  a  profitable  private
                       venture.


                       The profitability of the venture was stressed by both
                       the  owner  and  the  government  representative  who
                       accompanied the delegation.


                  *    Tiger Prawn Farm - Api Api Company


                       This was a large commercial venture  with  120  ponds
                       covering approximately 200 acres.


                       About 100 workers are employed and  an  eight-hectare
                       pond can produce five tonnes of  prawns  in  a  four-
                       monthly cycle.


                       The prawns are mainly exported to the US and  one  kg
                       fetches 18 to 20RM (ex-farm). A kg consists of 30  to
                       35 pieces, depending on its size.


                       Ponds are oxygenated by means of paddles and with the
                       use of piping, which is an indigenous technology.


                       An on-site laboratory is  used  to  check  the  water
                       parameters such as alkalinity, salinity  and  the  PH
                       level.


                       Feed is imported from Thailand.


                       Motorcycles  are  used  by  workers  to  cover   huge
                       distances on the site.


                       Government assistance is confined to training for the
                       transfer of technology.


              (c) Conclusion


                  The world's fish  production  is  in  the  region  of  100
                  million tonnes, of which about 87% is from marine  capture
                  fisheries and 13% from aquaculture.


                  However, production  from  marine  capture  fisheries  has
                  peaked. At present there is overcapacity in  this  sector,
                  resulting in an unprofitable state  of  the  industry.  In
                  fact, it is estimated that the value of the  catch  landed
                  is even below the operating cost.


                  Against this scenario is the projected increase in  demand
                  of 30 million tonnes by  the  turn  of  the  century,  due
                  largely to population  growth  from  5,5  billion  to  6,5
                  billion. The increase is not likely to  come  from  marine
                  capture fisheries, as this has reached a plateau.


                  This means that aquaculture  will  have  to  feature  more
                  prominently in future.


         4. Visit to Agrotechnology Park of Ulu Chuchuh, Sepang


              (a) Introduction


                  An Agrotechnology Park was specially land-gazetted by  the
                  government for agricultural activities, using  the  latest
                  technology.


                  The  main  objectives  of  the  Agrotechnology  Parks   in
                  Selangor are:


                  *    To develop intensive  agricultural  activities  using
                       the latest technology


                  *    To supply at least 30% of the fresh food required  in
                       the central region of peninsular Malaysia


                  *      To   promote   entrepreneurship   skills   in   the
                       agricultural sector among the participants


                  *    To promote the agrotechnology park as an  agrotourism
                       attraction.


                  The Parks hope to achieve  their  objectives  by  adopting
                  the following strategies:


                  *    The Government gazettes  discrete  land  holdings  of
                       100  hectares  or  more  for  agricultural  use   and
                       provides  basic  infrastructure  facilities  such  as
                       roads, drains, water and electricity supply which are
                       suitable  for  intensive  and  highly   technological
                       agricultural practices


                  *    Both local and  foreign  investors  who  utilise  the
                       latest  agricultural  technology  are  attracted   to
                       participate  in  these  projects   on   a   long-term
                       leasehold basis


                  *      Participants   are   assisted   with   agricultural
                       consultancy  services,   which   include   management
                       services.
                  The Selangor parks concentrate on the  production  of  the
                  following high value  commodities  to  meet  local  demand
                  (the exception is orchid  production  which  is  envisaged
                  chiefly for export markets):


                  *    Horticultural crops which include vegetables and  cut
                       flowers. Nurseries are developed with the  production
                       of planting materials utilising tissue culture


                  *    Short-term food crops such as maize, melons,  tubers,
                       root crops and  pumpkins  (seasonal  fruits  such  as
                       pineapples are grown in the agrotourism locations)


                  *     Suitable  livestock  such  as  chickens  and  ducks.
                       Aquaculture is also practiced with the production  of
                       fish fries and aquarium fish.


                  The  production  of  foodstuff  is  in   line   with   the
                  Government policy of working towards  increasing  national
                  food production.


              (b) Basic information on Agrotechnology Park at Sepang


                  The Park is 100 hectare in extent. It is situated  in  the
                  region of Sepang, about 30 km from the new town  of  Salak
                  Tinggi. It was started in 1996. The soil is shallow  peat,
                  which requires some improvement before it is suitable  for
                  agricultural production.


                  The Park has been through three phases. Phase 1  ended  in
                  2000 - it consisted of the development of 20  hectares  of
                  land at a cost of RM100  000.  Phase  2,  which  ended  in
                  2001, saw the development of a further 20 hectares at  the
                  cost of another RM100 000.  Phase  3  is  currently  under
                  way, with an additional 30 hectares being developed  at  a
                  cost of RM100 000.
                  The project status as at January 2002 was:


                  *    Total lots - 29 units


                  *    Lot size per unit - two hectares


                  *    Number of  participants  producing  vegetables  -  15
                       participants on 18 units


                  *     Number  of  participants  producing  flowers  -  six
                       participants on seven units


                  *    Vacant - four units.


                  Flower production has increased on an  annual  basis  with
                  the number of plants increasing from 280 000  in  1998  to
                  434 693  in  2001.  Productivity  increased  from  19  047
                  pots/hectare/year in 1998 to 33 437  pots/hectare/year  in
                  2001.


                  Vegetable production also increased  from  484  tonnes  in
                  1998 to 910 tonnes in 2001.  Productivity  increased  from
                  9,2 tonnes/hectare/year in 1998 to 18  tonnes/hectare/year
                  in 2001.


                  In both instances, increases could mainly be  ascribed  to
                  more efficient production methods.


                  The management of the park has  identified  the  following
                  constraints on production:


                  *     Mechanisation  is  still  limited  and   not   fully
                       optimised


                  *    The peat soil found in the park is a "problem soil"


                  *     Water  quality  and  water   management   could   be
                       improved.


                  Suggestions for the improvement of the park are:
                  *    Infrastructure works should be done before the  rainy
                       season


                  *    More ponds should be  built  to  increase  the  water
                       supply


                  *    Hydrated lime should be  used  to  improve  the  peat
                       soil


                  *    Emphasis should be put on engaging small farmers  and
                       agricultural entrepreneurs in production  within  the
                       park.


              (c) Interaction with participants in Park


                  The delegation met an  agricultural  entrepreneur  engaged
                  in orchid production. He said that his land  was  acquired
                  on a  21-year  lease  from  the  State  and  that  he  had
                  obtained financial assistance from the  Agricultural  Bank
                  in order to start production.


                  The State provided  support  in  supplying  infrastructure
                  and  giving  advice  on  management,  but  production  was
                  largely dependent on the enterprise and endeavour  of  the
                  entrepreneur himself. Continued participation in the  Park
                  depended on continuing constant production.


                  He provided employment for eight people, resulting  in  28
                  mouths being fed in the surrounding rural area.


                  The enterprise was very lucrative,  returning  profits  of
                  between RM3 milion and RM4 million annually.


              (d) Agro-tourism - visit to Banghuris Homestay


                  The  homestay  project  is  part  of  the  Park,  and  the
                  delegation was taken there to enjoy  a  traditional  Malay
                  lunch.


                  Visitors to the project stay  with  the  Malay  family  in
                  their  traditional  wooden  house  and  experience   their
                  traditional way of life. The exotic flavours of  the  meal
                  were a treat for the delegation.


                  The  State  promotes  the  venture   by   assisting   with
                  advertising  and   marketing,   as   well   as   providing
                  managerial assistance.


                  There are 23  houses  in  the  Sepang  Park  project,  and
                  guests are divided amongst these in order  to  spread  the
                  economic gain.


                  The Park's agricultural projects can be visited by  guests
                  at an additional cost.


                  Although  no  figures  were  given,  the  delegation   was
                  assured  that  staying   at   the   project   was   highly
                  affordable.


              (e) Visit to Women's Extension Group  (WEG)  engaged  in  food
                  processing


                  While still  in  the  Park,  the  delegation  visited  the
                  Women's Extension Group engaged in food processing.  Their
                  concept  is  an  interesting  Malaysian  innovation   that
                  manages to lighten the burden of rural women.


                  *    Background


                       WEG units are groups of farmwomen formed  at  village
                       level. They serve as a  platform  through  which  the
                       services  of  the  Department  of   Agriculture   are
                       channelled  to  farmwomen.   Through   these   units,
                       farmwomen have the opportunity to be involved in  the
                       planning of programmes as well as in  discussions  on
                       suitable activities to be  carried  out  for  and  by
                       them. The first unit was formed in  Bukit  Changgang,
                       Kuala Langat, Selangor in 1978.


                  *    The objectives of the units are:


                       -     To provide opportunities for  farmwomen  to  be
                           involved in activity planning at village level


                       -     To educate women about services and  facilities
                           available to them


                       -     To improve efficiency and management skills  in
                           domestic  and  related   fields   through   group
                           efforts


                       -     To  improve  leadership  skills  for  community
                           development.


                       Units are headed by management committees.  Committee
                       members are village locals who  are  elected  by  the
                       members of the unit. The  Department  of  Agriculture
                       acts as adviser, while committees plan activities for
                       members.


                       All women working on a farm or who are members of the
                       farm family, are eligible to become unit members.


                       The  activities  carried  out  by   WEG   units   are
                       threefold:


                       -     Economic activities such  as  food  processing,
                           agriculture, crafts and services


                       -     Activities which enhance the quality  of  life,
                           such as food  and  nutrition,  beautification  of
                           home  surroundings  and  public  areas   in   the
                           village,  environmental  cleanliness,   vegetable
                           gardening  and  planting  of  non-seasonal  fruit
                           trees around the home


                       -      Community  development  activities,  such   as
                           social  projects,  for  the  development  of  the
                           individual, family and community.
                       By the end of 2001, there were 1 324  units  with  33
                       121 members all over Peninsular Malaysia. There  were
                       about  2  344  income-generating  projects,  made  up
                       mainly of food processing projects.


                       The  Department  of  Agriculture  has  personnel,  at
                       federal, state  and  area  level,  who  help  develop
                       advisory  services  that   are   channelled   through
                       demonstrations,  farm  and  house  visits  and   unit
                       meetings.


                       Competitions are periodically held to select the best
                       WEG  groups.  Prizes  take  the  form  of  inputs  or
                       processing equipment that will  further  enhance  the
                       profitability of farm projects.


                       The  total  turnover  for  these  projects  was  RM81
                       million in 2001.


                  *    Visit to WEG food processing group in  Agrotechnology
                       Park, Sepang
                       The group was formed by women  from  the  surrounding
                       villages who had come together for  the  purposes  of
                       processing snacks such as biscuits.


                       The delegation  found  a  thriving  small  enterprise
                       consisting of about 15 participants who  were  housed
                       in one large room.


                       When  starting  out,  the  group  had  pooled   their
                       resources and were  provided  with  equipment  and  a
                       grant  for  the  building  by   the   Department   of
                       Agriculture.


                       Profit,  which  comes  largely  from  bulk  sales  to
                       supermarkets, is divided amongst the members  of  the
                       group.


                       The Department  of  Agriculture  interacts  with  the
                       management  committee  in   an   advisory   capacity,
                       although the State also provides some  equipment  and
                       training as  well  as  assistance  in  marketing  the
                       product.


                       The group succeeds because of the hard  work  of  its
                       participants, the skilful entrepreneurial  activities
                       of the management group and the democratic nature  of
                       its organisation.


         5. Visit to State of Malacca


              The visit  to  the  State  of  Malacca  started  with  another
              briefing on agriculture by the Department  of  Agriculture  of
              that state. Most of the  points  raised  had  previously  been
              raised in earlier briefings that the delegation had received.


              The briefing was followed by another  visit  to  a  WEG  group
              engaged in the production of snacks. This too was  similar  to
              the previous meeting with such a group in Sepang.


              (a) Group farming in Malaysia
                  The visit to Malacca  was  supposed  to  illustrate  group
                  farming in Malaysia. Unfortunately, as will  be  explained
                  later, this goal was not achieved. However, the  principle
                  of group farming in Malaysia, and the  extension  services
                  that go along with  it,  are  important  and  need  to  be
                  discussed.


                  *    Group Farming Extension Services


                       The  Department  of  Agriculture  in   Malaysia   has
                       implemented  extension  services  based  on  farmers'
                       group projects since 1984. The concept  is  aimed  at
                       elevating farm  production,  utilising  optimum  farm
                       resources  by  grouping  the  farms  physically   and
                       incorporating farming activities through the  process
                       of technology transfer and farm management within the
                       group.


                       To this end, the Department devised a quality  system
                       for extension services to ensure that it will provide
                       quality services that will include, among others, the
                       preparation of project business plans. It  will  also
                       ensure  that  the  implementation   of   agricultural
                       activities and farm operations are in accordance with
                       the working manual for extension.


                       Through direct  supervision  and  strict  monitoring,
                       this system will initiate farmers  to  practice  farm
                       management and adopt it as  a  culture  in  producing
                       quality products and attaining crop potential yield.


                       By employing this system,  the  Department  hopes  to
                       provide effective and efficient extension services to
                       farmers in transforming current activities towards  a
                       more feasible and profitable agricultural industry.


                       The objectives of the quality system are:


                       -     To implement at  least  80%  of  the  extension
                           activities  planned  at  state  level  for   that
                           particular year


                       -      To  increase  the  income  of  group   farming
                           participants  through  optimal  use  of  land  in
                           order to achieve at least  70%  of  the  targeted
                           net income for the year  based  on  the  business
                           plan


                       -     To achieve at least 70% of the total  potential
                           yield for the cultivated crop for the year as  in
                           the business plan


                       -     To achieve at least 70% of the yearly target of
                           establishing new farm groups.


                       By the end of 2001, 660  farming  groups  under  this
                       system had shown a dramatic increase in productivity.


              (b) Visit to Group Farming Mango Project


                  In order to illustrate the above principles at  work,  the
                  delegation was taken to a mango group-farming  project  in
                  Malacca. Unfortunately, although much high  quality  fruit
                  was clearly being produced and the  farmers  were  assured
                  of  a  good  income,  only  two  of   the   original   six
                  participants remained in the group. Reasons for  the  four
                  having left were not clearly specified,  although  it  was
                  mentioned that some of them were old.


                  1,6 hectares are under cultivation, and it produces  eight
                  tonnes of fruit  per  season.  Initial  subsidisation  had
                  come from the state but now the project is entirely  self-
                  financing.


                  The farmers have clearly  benefitted  from  the  extension
                  services of the state and they  have  also  been  assisted
                  with management skills. Unfortunately, they had  to  leave
                  for prayers before the delegation could delve more  deeply
                  into these matters.


         6. Malaysian Technical Co-operation Programme (MTCP)


              One of the objectives of the study tour was for the delegation
              to obtain information on the Malaysian Technical  Co-operation
              Programme. The following points were raised at a  briefing  in
              Putrajaya on 2 July 2002:


              (a) MTCP was launched in 1980 with following objectives


                  *     To   share   development   experience   with   other
                       developing countries


                  *     To  strengthen   bilateral   relationships   between
                       Malaysia and other developing countries


                  *    To promote South-South co-operation

                       countries


                  The motivating philosophy behind the MTCP is based on  the
                  belief  that  human  resource  development  is   a   vital
                  catalyst for countries  to  achieve  sustainable  economic
                  and social development.

                  *    Reciprocating technical  expertise  by  participating
                       countries to Malaysia.


     E.     Conclusions


         1. Malaysia is a progressive developing country  with  huge  dreams
              for the future. South Africa has much to learn from  Malaysia,
              especially in the fields of economic planning, strategies  for
              development and the unlocking of the entrepreneurial spirit of
              its people.


         2. There is much room for co-operation  between  South  Africa  and
              Malaysia in the technical field, especially  with  respect  to
              aquaculture.


         3. The objectives of the study tour were achieved and the  time  in
              Malaysia was well spent.


     F.     Recommendations


         The Committee recommends the  following  as  a  result  of  lessons
         learnt on the study tour to Malaysia:


         1. South Africa should  consider  drawing  up  a  widely  consulted
              development plan along the lines of  Malaysia's  Vision  2020.
              Such an overall development plan  for  the  economy  could  be
              supplemented by  other  plans  for  development  in  the  most
              significant developmental  sectors  such  as  Agriculture  and
              Trade and Industry.


         2.  The  Department   of   Agriculture   should   investigate   the
              possibility of setting up Agro-Technology Parks,  which  could
              become centres in which the entrepreneurial  spirit  of  small
              farmers are developed with a view to them becoming  commercial
              farmers. The Parks would also be sites where assistance  could
              be channelled to emerging farmers on a more systematic basis.


         3. The Department of  Agriculture  should  adopt  the  strategy  of
              encouraging group farming to ensure the pooling  of  resources
              by emerging farmers. This will also  enable  them  to  benefit
              from  the  economies  of  scale,  which  will   smooth   their
              transition to commercial farmers. Technical assistance in  the
              fields of management and marketing could also be  supplied  to
              them more efficiently.


         4. South Africa could emulate the Malaysian model in the  formation
              of women's groups. This will enable especially rural women  to
              engage in economic activities, thereby increasing  the  income
              of rural families.


         5. The Malaysian model of Agro-Tourism should be  further  examined
              with a view to  implementing  a  similar  model,  which  would
              improve the income of the rural population.


         6. The development of Aquaculture should  be  seriously  looked  at
              with a view to solving the problem of our  diminishing  marine
              resources, which results in so many of our fisher  folk  being
              left without fishing rights. Fish from this source would  also
              be a cheap supplementary source of protein to bolster our food
              stocks.


         7. South Africa should take advantage of the assistance offered  by
              the Malaysian Technical Co-operation Programme in the field of
              human resource development. Concrete steps should be taken  to
              ensure that experts are trained, especially in  the  field  of
              Aquaculture.


     G.     Acknowledgements


         The Committee heartily thanks those members of  the  South  African
         High  Commission  in  Malaysia  and  officials  of  the   Malaysian
         Government who worked so hard to make this study tour a  meaningful
         learning experience.


         APPENDIX


         Although it was not part of the original programme, the  delegation
         paid a visit to the Malaysian Parliament on 4 July 2002  to  obtain
         insight into  this  institution  and  the  Malaysian  parliamentary
         system. They learnt the following:


         Malaysia practices Parliamentary Democracy  with  a  Constitutional
         Monarch. The Parliamentary Democratic System comprises  three  main
         branches - legislative, executive and judiciary.


         His Majesty the Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  is  the  Supreme  Head  of
         State. He is elected by the Conference of Rulers and  holds  office
         for five years. He does not, however, preside over the  two  Houses
         of Parliament, but addresses both Houses as and when necessary.  By
         convention, this is only done  at  the  beginning  of  each  annual
         parliamentary session.
         The Senate (Dewan Negara) comprises of 69 members, of whom two  are
         elected by each of the 13 State Legislative Assemblies and  43  are
         appointed  by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  on  grounds  of  their
         experience  and  wisdom,  or  to   represent   racial   minorities,
         professional, commercial and other groups. A full  term  of  office
         for a senator is three years and could be extended for  two  terms.
         The Senate is not affected by the dissolution of Parliament.


         The House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat) has 193  members,  each
         representing  one  constituency.  Elections  are  held  every  five
         years. The number of members  of  the  Barisan  Nasional  Component
         Parties is 148. The opposition parties consist of 45 members.


         The functions of Parliament are:


         *  To pass laws
         *  To amend existing laws


         *  To examine government policies
         *  To approves government expenditure/spending


         *  To approve new taxes.


         At the beginning of each year, the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong  outlines
         national progress and future development policies.


         The Malaysian Parliament does not have a committee  system  similar
         to the South African system.


     Report to be considered.
