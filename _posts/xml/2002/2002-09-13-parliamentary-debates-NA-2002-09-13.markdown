                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House notes:


  (1) that the women of South Africa call on the government of the  Federal
       Republic  of  Nigeria,  the  African  Union  and  the   international
       community to fight and spare the life of Amina Lawal  and  all  other
       women who are  being  sentenced  to  death  by  stoning  for  alleged
       adultery;


  (2) the women believe that this act violates the human rights  they  have
       been given through:


       (a)  the Constitutive Act of the African Union;


       (b)  the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria;


       (c)   the  UN  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  all   Forms   of
           Discrimination Against Women; and


  (3) that therefore, women have the right to exercise  their  reproductive
       rights, to freedom of association and to freedom of movement; and


  (4) that the women therefore believe that Amina Lawal's  life  should  be
       spared, and that all  leaders  internationally  and  in  Africa  must
       support this motion.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a small group of ANC members are determined to change  the  name
           of Tzaneen to Mark Shope;


       (b)   the  area  was  known  as  Tsaneng  (Tzaneen),  meaning  ``come
           together'' or ``the place where people gather'', long before any
           white settler came to the district; and


       (c)  the majority  of  the  community  across  cultures  is  strongly
           opposed to this divisive and misguided proposal; and


  (2) therefore calls on the  ANC  leadership  to  bring  back  sanity  and
       encourage their comrades to concentrate  on  real  issues  that  will
       benefit those in desperate need in this poverty-stricken province.

[Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that an investigation team, appointed by the Gauteng  MEC,  has
       uncovered numerous irregularities and incidents of corruption in  the
       provision of housing, including a developer who  has  been  paid  R41
       million to build 5 000 houses, but constructed only eight;


  (2) hopes that the investigation identifies and weeds out all the corrupt
       people involved so that the department can honestly  start  providing
       housing to the people who really need it; and


  (3) urges the relevant authorities to take the necessary steps, once  the
       investigation is complete, against the  people  contributing  to  the
       corruption and who are preventing the honest provision of housing.

Mr L M KGWELE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development  noted  that
       agriculture plays a crucial role in addressing the needs of a growing
       global population and has a direct link  to  poverty  eradication  in
       developing countries;


  (2) further notes that the summit called for the improvement of land  and
       water resource management, the increasing of agricultural  production
       in a sustainable way and the increasing of  technical  and  financial
       assistance to farmers in developing countries;


  (3) believes that the implementation of these strategies will  contribute
       positively to ensuring that there  is  food  security  and  increased
       agricultural production in developing countries;


  (4) welcomes the summit's decision; and


  (5) further calls on countries of the North and on the United  States  in
       particular, to desist  from  providing  subsidies  to  their  farmers
       because this poses a barrier to agricultural products from developing
       economies entering their markets.

[Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mr Chairman, I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that land reform, as being conducted in Zimbabwe, is destroying
       individual  property  rights,  the  cornerstone  of  all   successful
       economies, while thousands of new farmers are being  settled  without
       any support by the government; and


  (2) supports the land reform programmes being rolled out in South Africa,
       especially by the Western Cape New NP-ANC provincial government, that
       strives -


       (a)  to settle 7 000 emerging farmers, supported by  an  encompassing
           financial, managerial and agricultural extension service; and


       (b)  to secure land ownership and land-use rights for all commercial,
           small-scale and subsistence farmers.

[Applause.]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay that the SABC head office was yesterday  raided  by
       the Scorpions, who are engaged  in  preliminary  investigations  into
       allegations  of  massive  fraud  and   corruption   at   the   public
       broadcaster;


  (2) expresses its concern at the state of affairs of the SABC, given that
       these developments follow hot on the heels  of  the  tabling  of  the
       controversial  Broadcasting  Amendment  Bill,  as  well  as  shocking
       comments by a prominent SABC board member that editorial integrity is
       an outdated and clich√©d concept;


  (3) reaffirms its commitment to a free and open  democratic  society  and
       the duty of the public broadcaster in this regard to  accurately  and
       impartially inform and entertain the citizens of South Africa; and


  (4) calls upon the Board of the SABC to  assist  the  Scorpions  so  that
       these allegations of corruption are vigorously investigated,  and  to
       swiftly punish ...

[Time expired.]

Ms E NGALEKA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that local artists and designers displayed their  work  at  the
       Ubuntu Village during the World Summit on Sustainable Development;


  (2) believes  that  these  artists  acted  as  cultural  ambassadors  and
       represented the true cultural heritage of the people of South  Africa
       and, in so doing, generated interest in South Africa, thus attracting
       those would-be tourists to come back to the country;


  (3) commends all those who displayed their arts and crafts  work  at  the
       WSSD  for  their  contribution  to  the  local  economic  development
       programme; and


  (4) encourages all small, medium and micro  enterprises  to  follow  this
       initiative for sustainable socioeconomic development.

[Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with sadness the tragedy that took  place  in  Acacia  Park  on
       Wednesday afternoon, 11 September, when four-year-old Aphiwe  Stofile
       drowned after falling into the park swimming pool;


  (2) sends heartfelt condolences to  Aphiwe's  twin  brother  and  to  his
       mother, Bongiwe Stofile, and prays the Lord Jesus Christ will comfort
       them during this time of great sorrow;


  (3) further notes that this is the third drowning at Acacia Park within a
       three-year period; and


  (4) calls on  Public  Works  to  secure  the  enclosure  immediately  and
       adequately, engage the services of life-savers when the pool is  open
       or ensure that the pool stays closed, and to ensure strict  adherence
       to  bans  on  alcohol  in  the  area  and  children  under  12  being
       accompanied by adults, the swimming pool at present poses a threat to
       the safety of park residents, especially children.
[Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice on  behalf  of  Azapo
that I shall move at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the UN General Assembly is meeting  at  a  time  when  the
       world is confronted with uncertainty as a result of the United States
       policy of intolerance and a tendency to want  to  dictate  how  other
       countries should run their affairs;


  (2) further notes that America and Britain, who  are  champions  of  this
       policy, have always possessed weapons of mass destruction which  they
       have used in Afghanistan and other parts of the world, and  that  the
       United Nations appears to be  unable  to  force  these  countries  to
       honour UN protocols and agreements; and


  (3) calls on the UN General Assembly and the Security Council to call  on
       the Bush administration to abide by UN  resolutions  and  to  conduct
       their international activities in accordance with UN agreements.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms S K MNUMZANA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the World Summit on Sustainable Development resolved  that
       the countries of the world should use chemicals and  hazardous  waste
       in a manner that minimises harm to human health and the environment;


  (2) further notes that the summit also  agreed  to  enhance  co-operation
       between nation states to stabilise greenhouse gas  concentrations  in
       the atmosphere;


  (3) believes that this  will  contribute  positively  to  preserving  our
       global environment; and


  (4) welcomes this resolution of the Johannesburg Summit.

[Applause.]

Mr B G BELL: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the devastation caused by the veld fires in Mpumalanga in July,
       which killed six people and injured 568, destroyed 68 000 hectares of
       land, destroyed homes, killed thousands of  stock  animals  and  cost
       farmers R30 million;


  (2) further notes the abject failure of the Government to take any action
       in response to this devastation; and


  (3) calls on the Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  to  take
       immediate steps to declare a national disaster in the  affected  area
       and to provide disaster relief to those who have  lost  their  homes,
       their livelihoods and their farming operations.

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that South Africa has given the highest priority to  developing
       tourism as an industry in order to stimulate job creation;


  (2) recognises that South Africa is uniquely placed  in  this  regard  on
       account of its climate, beauty, infrastructure, democracy  and  price
       to be competitive and attractive;


  (3) recognises also that the departments are doing  its  utmost  to  make
       South Africa a travel destination of choice; and
  (4) calls on the entire travel industry to make Tourism Month the peak of
       all our endeavours in promoting and advancing tourism in our country.

Ms M M MAUNYE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the World Summit on Sustainable Development has thrown its
       weight behind the New Partnership for Africa's Development;


  (2) further notes that the WSSD committed the international community  to
       providing, amongst other things, technical and financial  support  to
       prevent deforestation and to promote equitable access to  health-care
       services on the African continent;


  (3) believes that this represents a historic breakthrough in the struggle
       to fight poverty in Africa; and
  (4) welcomes the enthusiastic and firm support displayed by the summit in
       our endeavour to work for the development of our continent.

[Applause.]

Mr D G MKONO: Chairperson, I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a vessel that was abandoned at sea earlier this  week  has
       run aground at St Lucia;


  (2) further notes that St Lucia is a world heritage site and is  regarded
       as one of the most unique and fragile ecosystems on the planet with a
       wide variety of plant and sea life, which  holds  great  conservation
       and tourism value for South Africa;


  (3) expresses concern that the vessel contains more than a thousand  tons
       of oil and an unknown quantity  of  toxic  and  flammable  chemicals,
       which pose a massive threat to the ecology of this vital site; and


  (4) calls upon the Government to co-ordinate an  urgent  intervention  to
       ensure that pollution of this pristine environment is avoided.

                          GAS REGULATOR LEVIES BILL

                               (Introduction)
The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and hon members, how long do  you  want
this speech to be? I move. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Bill referred to the Portfolio Committee on Finance  for  consideration  and
report.

                                FINANCE BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and hon members, in  the  interests  of
TGIF, I move. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, owing to the guidelines  before
us, after the introductory speech the Chair is supposed to  refer  the  Bill
to the committee, but  in  this  case  there  was  no  introductory  speech.
[Laughter.] However, Minister, in the interests of TGIF, we will  refer  the
Bill to the portfolio committee. [Laughter.]

Bill referred to the Portfolio Committee on Finance  for  consideration  and
report.

                 COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT SCHEMES CONTROL BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and hon members, the  Collective
Investment Schemes Control Bill, as it is commonly  referred  to,  has  been
drafted over the past three years and has  been  through  a  very  wide  and
thorough consultative process.

This is evident from the fact that when the hearings of the  committee  were
held, no submissions were received from  industry.  The  Bill  replaces  and
consolidates the Unit Trusts Control  Act  of  1981  and  the  Participation
Bonds Act of 1981.

The collective investment industry in South Africa had humble beginnings  in
the mid-1960s, but has grown exponentially since the  mid-1990s.  The  total
assets under management have grown from around R25 billion in 1994  to  just
over R176 billion in 2002.

This Bill is intended to safeguard  the  investments  of  some  2,5  million
account holders.  The  profile  of  investors  in  this  industry  reflects,
unfortunately, South Africa's  historical  inequities.  However,  one  would
like to point out that about 40% of investors are, in fact, middle to  lower
income earners of all races.

This industry offers investment products, but costs as  little  as  R50  per
month, and it is my hope that over time the investor  profile  will  reflect
the true composition of our society. It is our priority to ensure  that  the
costs of investing in a collective investment scheme are, firstly,  properly
disclosed to investors and, secondly, competitive in the sense  that  we  do
not pose a barrier to the participation of low-income earners.

Although fees and commissions in this industry  were  deregulated  in  1998,
when compared with the cost of investing in other products  on  the  market,
collective investment  schemes  are  highly  competitive.  The  industry  is
arguably the most transparent when it  comes  to  disclosures  of  fees  and
commissions to investors.

It should  be  remembered  that  South  Africans  have  a  long  history  of
participation in collective investment schemes  through,  for  example,  the
proliferation of stokvels. These are not defined  as  collective  investment
schemes in this Bill, as they are private arrangements.  But  it  should  be
noted that stokvels have served our communities  well  and  have  created  a
deep sense of collective savings.

The Bill has been designed to ensure that investors are able to  participate
fairly  in  this  method  of  investment,  thereby  having  access  to   the
opportunity to make a return. It should be noted that investing  in  a  unit
trust portfolio, a participation bond, or a collective investment scheme  in
property are all regulated within the ambit of this Bill.

I would like to highlight the key investor measures contained  in  the  Bill
as these are key to ensuring that the industry itself is financially  sound,
and that investors' funds are  adequately  protected  from  unscrupulous  or
negligent fund managers.

The first key investor protection measure contained in the Bill  relates  to
the separation of the manager of a scheme from the trustee or  custodian  of
a scheme. At no point in time can the investment manager of  a  scheme  take
control of the investors' funds in such a scheme. All transactions  made  by
the manager must be authorised by the trustee. The relationship between  the
custodian and the manager and  the  responsibilities  that  they  share  are
clearly set out in the Bill.

The duties of a custodian have been enhanced,  and  the  issue  of  who  may
offer such services has been more clearly spelt  out  in  this  legislation.
This is to ensure that there are no  ambiguities  with  regard  to  what  is
expected of a trustee.

The second key set of investor  protection  measures  relates  to  different
types of disclosures required by the legislation. This is arguably the  most
nonprudential investor protection measure.  The  disclosure  of  information
relating to the  risks  of  an  investment,  the  potential  rewards,  fees,
commissions,  administration  costs  and  all  marketing   information   are
regulated through this Bill.

This provides a comprehensive approach to the disclosure  of  all  important
and material information to an investor. This is  intended  to  ensure  that
the investor is able to make an informed decision. It should  be  remembered
that the Financial Advisers and Intermediary Services Bill  will  complement
the disclosure provisions in this Bill, and will go a long way  in  ensuring
that all investors are able to make informed decisions.

Finally, I would like to mention some key prudential measures  contained  in
the Bill that are also investor protection measures in that they ensure  the
financial soundness of schemes. These relate to the liquidity of  a  scheme,
the investment spread of assets and the capital adequacy of  the  management
company.

In terms of the provisions for liquidity in  a  scheme,  when  one  or  more
investors decide to sell  their  participatory  interests,  those  investors
remaining in a scheme are at risk, given the obligation of  the  manager  to
pay an investor within a short period of time, generally 72 hours.

To minimise this risk for the  remaining  investors,  provisions  have  been
made for a manager to borrow  in  the  short  term  against  the  underlying
assets in a scheme to provide immediate liquidity. In addition, the  manager
has the ability to ring-fence a sale  order  and  pay  an  investor  over  a
period of 20 days. This provision does not  apply  to  investors  with  less
than R50¬†000 in a scheme. Borrowing  will  be  strictly  controlled  through
regulations and monitored by the registrar.

Provisions relating to the capital adequacy of the management  company  have
changed from the previous Act. A management company is now required to  hold
capital of its own and not in the scheme  itself.  This  is  very  important
because now 100% of investors' capital  is  invested  productively  and  the
onus is on the management  company  to  ensure  that  they  have  sufficient
resources to operate a scheme.

The most common prudential measures are the  limitations  on  the  types  of
investments permissible in a portfolio, for example 5% in  a  single  share,
or 5% of the total value of market capitalisation in a single  share.  Also,
investment spread provisions vary between different types of portfolios.

In closing, it is important  to  state  that  this  Bill  is  a  significant
improvement on existing legislation,  and  we  are  very  pleased  with  the
outcome of this process, which was fairly  lengthy  and  comprehensive,  and
which has led to this Bill being presented to Parliament. We  would  request
that the House adopt this Bill. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members,  before  I  call  on  the
next speaker, can we have some order in the House. Would all members  please
be seated.

Ms B A HOGAN: Chairman, the work of the Portfolio Committee on  Finance  was
greatly enhanced when this Bill came  to  us  in  Parliament  owing  to  the
extensive consultation process which preceded the Bill coming  to  us,  this
consultation process having been undertaken by  the  executive  and  by  the
Financial Services Board in particular.

The initiative arose several  years  ago,  particularly  from  the  industry
itself, as a result of feeling the keen edge  of  competition  from  foreign
participants on the market. Initiatives were then taken to look at  refining
and amending this Bill so that we could become internationally competitive.

By the time this Bill arrived before us in  the  committee,  so  much  work,
thinking, rethinking, redrafting and redeliberating had taken  place  within
the conferences and workshops convened by the Financial Services Board  that
we virtually had no submissions from anyone in the public,  apart  from  one
or two tiny amendments that were proposed and which we accepted.

This is an example, I think, of sterling consultation on  the  part  of  the
Ministry and the Financial Services Board. It is also an example  of  how  a
Bill should come before Parliament: well researched, well worked  out,  well
connected to people who would be affected by this Bill.

However, the impression should not be given that the  collective  investment
services  industry  is  an  industry  which  drastically  and   dramatically
requires greater supervision. In fact, this industry, known  to  us  as  the
unit-trust industry, has been one of the most safe  savings  provisions  and
investment provisions for the ordinary person in the  street  that  we  have
seen. It is this industry's unique features  that  make  it  a  very  useful
investment tool.

For instance, the ordinary person in the street need not invest directly  in
shares, but can invest in a unit  trust,  which  means  that  the  money  so
invested is taken by an investment manager who has the necessary skills  and
understanding of the market and invested on behalf of  that  person  in  the
street, together with the other funds invested  by  other  role-players.  In
other words, there is a pool of funds provided to the fund  manager  by  the
various investors. That pool of funds is then  invested  in  shares  on  the
whole, although there are some other trusts, which I will  not  go  into  at
the moment.

The interesting feature about unit trusts  is  that  whilst  the  investment
manager or the management company does the investment and  makes  investment
decisions, those decisions are bound by a trust deed, which spells out  what
kind of investments and what the parameters are for investment.  That  trust
deed is drawn up between the management company and the  board  of  trustees
or a custodian.

The custodian is completely separate from the management company and can  be
a banking  institution  or  a  long-term  life  insurer  a  whole  range  of
institutions can qualify as a trustee and their job is to  ensure  that  the
money being used  by  the  investment  manager  is  used  according  to  the
agreement in the trust deed.

However, the Bill tightens up considerably  the  role  of  the  trustee  and
makes sure that the trustee maintains careful oversight  over  the  way  the
money is spent and that money is not abused in that fund.

So we have a unique  situation  in  that  whilst  money  is  invested  by  a
management company, there is  very  tight  oversight  over  that  management
company by the trustee and the custodian. One  of  the  main  provisions  of
this  Bill  is  to  ensure  that  that  custodian  exercises  his   or   her
responsibilities with due care.

The other  provisions,  which  are  very  important  and  which  the  Deputy
Minister has also alluded to, are  the  prudential  provisions  particularly
around liquidity of the fund. I am not going to go into the details of  that
because the Deputy Minister himself has spelt them out. But  they  are  very
important, because they ensure that the fund  maintains  its  liquidity  and
that one cannot, as it  were  -  which  sometimes  happens  with  banks  and
smaller banks in particular - have a run on the fund, which would mean  that
the investors suffer the consequences of such a run on the fund.

There are other matters which this Bill deals with, such as  the  powers  of
the registrar - the fact that one can have a  self-regulating  authority  in
the industry itself, which is to be welcomed.  I  will  not  go  into  these
details because my collegues will cover them.

Suffice it to  say  that  the  ANC  supports  this  Bill  and  congratulates
industry role-players and the regulator on their sterling  work  in  putting
this Bill before us in Parliament and looks forward to heightened  and  more
lucrative investment on the part of  the  ordinary  person  in  the  street.
[Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, hon members, the Collective  Investment  Schemes
Control Bill comes against the backdrop of a number of  changes  within  the
financial  services  sector.  This  House  recently  adopted  the  Financial
Advisory and Intermediary Services Bill and there is clearly a  close  link,
although a  clear  division  of  labour,  between  the  FAIS  Bill  and  the
Collective Investment Schemes Control Bill.

For its part, the FAIS Bill will  result  in  greater  protection  for  unit
trusts or collective investment scheme investors who may  increasingly  want
to rely on intermediaries for financial services and advice. Both  the  FAIS
Bill and the CISC Bill, the CISC Bill being the Bill we are debating  today,
bring  South  Africa's  financial  services  sector  more   in   line   with
international best practice.

Furthermore, we adopt  this  Bill  in  the  context  of  debates  about  the
adoption of a single regulator for the financial services sector,  and  many
of the new regulatory obligations and duties created by both the  FAIS  Bill
and the CISC Bill might, in future, resort  under  the  auspices  of  a  new
regulatory agency.
The debate in this  regard  is  clearly  one  that  pits  a  sector-specific
regulatory focus against complex arguments  of  an  increasing  trend  among
industry players to provide a multitude of financial services,  as  well  as
mergers across sectors within what is broadly referred to as  the  financial
services industry.

The  proverbial  winds  of  change  are  increasingly  blowing  through  the
financial services  sector.  In  this  context  of  change  and  concomitant
uncertainty, the DA calls on the Minister  of  Finance  to  ensure  that  he
keeps  a  strong  dialogue  process  with  all  financial  services   sector
stakeholders,  particularly  in  planning  and   compiling   any   envisaged
empowerment charter for this crucial sector of our economy.

Any mining charter-style antics in the financial services sector  will  cost
our economy  dearly.  Fortunately,  National  Treasury  and  the  Minister's
approach at the recent Nedlac summit appear to  be  far  more  rational  and
responsible than the steps taken by his colleague in Minerals and Energy.
However, it is regrettable that comments such as  those  attributed  to  the
Minister of Finance at the Nedlac summit that the financial services  sector
was too exclusive, too discriminatory and a  hindrance  to  economic  growth
were made. Such statements  do  not  instil  confidence  and  bode  ill  for
investors in this sector. He must refrain from referring to  any  sector  of
our  society  or  economy  as  a  hindrance  to  our  growth  or   progress.
[Interjections.]

South Africa is a country with a poor savings track record.  The  Collective
Investment Schemes Control Bill is yet another instrument with which we  aim
to address this problem. However,  the  problem  of  low  levels  of  saving
cannot be addressed purely by legislative  measures  and  sound  regulation,
necessary conditions as these may be.

Sufficient conditions will always remain a sound and  healthy  economy.  The
current reality in South Africa - confirmed yet again yesterday  by  another
interest rate hike, the fourth this year -  is  one  of  an  ever-increasing
cost of living and an ever-decreasing surplus income available  for  saving.
These are broader problems that neither the CISC Bill,  a  single  financial
regulator or an empowerment charter for the sector can fix.

In fostering a culture of saving, it is important to eradicate the  presence
of dubious players. In this regard, the DA welcomes the creation of  a  call
centre and hotline for investors by the National Treasury and the FSB.

The CISC Bill supplants the Unit Trusts Control Act and primarily  seeks  to
regulate and control the  establishment  and  administration  of  collective
investment schemes. In the context of  the  new  regulatory  framework,  the
Bill draws  a  distinction  between  five  types  of  collective  investment
schemes.

Apart from the clear and uncontestable imperatives of  investor  protection,
one of the most important reasons for the existence of the new  Bill  is  to
enhance industry competitiveness and attract investment. As things stand  at
present, South African institutions are not  able  to  offer  the  range  of
collective investment schemes available in other countries,  simply  because
there is no existing legislation that governs their use. A case in point  is
the open-ended investment company - an alternative to unit  trusts  -  which
has been highly successful in the UK and other jurisdictions  and  which  we
provide for today in this Bill.

Our ability to attract investors, both  foreign  and  local,  is,  in  large
measure, a function of  the  diversity  of  the  available  instruments  and
investment options. Familiarity, or at  least  comparability,  is  obviously
paramount, particularly to investors  from  outside  South  Africa.  Amongst
various benefits, the CISC Bill will allow for  the  introduction  of  other
investment products, such as open-ended investment companies - OEICs  -  and
hedge funds.

The Bill, therefore, seeks to open up the  industry  to  global  competition
with a broader definition of collective investment schemes. Hedge funds  and
other leveraged funds will have increased scope  to  operate  in  the  South
African market, subject to certain stringent  conditions.  These  conditions
must  satisfy  the  Financial  Services  Board  that  such  funds   can   be
responsibly marketed, conveying to investors both  the  risks  involved  and
the strategies used in order to enable the investors to make  the  necessary
risk-reward-ratio decisions and be cognisant of  all  the  risks  and  their
appetite for such risks.

After the passage of this Bill, it is clear that  the  market  will  eagerly
await signals from the FSB on what types of hedge funds will be  allowed  to
operate in the South African  market.  Some  of  the  key  features  of  the
Collective Investment Schemes Control Bill  include  that  it  carries  more
stringent responsibilities for trustees  and  custodians,  as  well  as  new
provisions on capital adequacy. Clearly,  such  provisions  strongly  favour
both the interests of investors and the sector itself.

In  addition,  the  Bill  contains   provisions   for   enhanced   financial
disclosure, which can be welcomed  in  the  context  of  global  debates  on
corporate governance reform and improved protection clauses for investors.

Regulation and supervision of the industry will also be improved, while  the
option and continued scope for creating  a  self-regulatory  environment  is
retained in the Bill. This local debate will clearly be informed  by  global
developments on the debate on self-regulation versus statutory regulation.

Because the CISC  Bill  clearly  seeks  the  modernisation  of  the  sector,
improved  scope  for  attracting  foreign  direct   investment   and   could
significantly contribute to fostering a culture  of  saving,  the  DA  takes
pleasure in supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Chairperson, the IFP will support this Bill. This  Bill  will
provide a modern legislative  framework  for  the  equity  unit  trust,  the
property unit trust and the participation mortgage  bond  scheme  industries
in line with international best practice.
The policy board for financial services and regulation,  in  its  review  of
the regulatory framework for financial  service  industries,  proposed  that
all forms of collective investment schemes should be regulated by  only  one
Act. This Act must also provide for the  establishment  of  new  structures,
which is not possible in the context of current legislation.

If we look at this combination,  we  are  looking  at  South  Africa's  unit
trusts in which  there  are  more  than  2  million  investors.  As  far  as
participation bonds are concerned, there are only about  80  000  investors.
The amounts also differ radically from about R130 billion to  as  little  as
R4 billion. Now this reminds me of a pie that is made up of a donkey  and  a
rabbit. [Laughter.] I do not know which part is the donkey.

When one has a combination of 50:50 in the mix, then at the end of  the  day
one can say, ``Yes, it is one donkey and one rabbit that is going into  this
pie''.  This  is  what  is  happening  here  with  the  small  quantity   of
participation bonds in relation to the South African unit  trusts.  However,
it is important that this be covered on the widest particular aspect.

This Bill, therefore, provides for the control, regulation  and  supervision
of all investment-based collective investment schemes. It also provides  for
the appointment  of  a  representative  advisory  committee  to  advise  the
Minister, and deals with the issuing of a licence,  the  annual  renewal  of
such licence and the approval of the rules of an  industry  association  for
all those participating in this particular aspect.

In addition, the Bill deals with risk-based  capital  requirements  for  the
managers of the collective  investment  schemes  in  order  to  protect  the
investors. The avoidance of conflict is also very important.

Now, if one looks at the global situation and at the collective position  of
South Africa, the relaxation of exchange control and  integration  into  the
international financial markets have significantly increased the  investment
options available. It is, therefore, important  that  we  not  only  solicit
local investors but  also  the  foreign  investment  schemes  that  are  now
available to South African investors.

The combination of trust structure and exchange control  and  taxation  has,
furthermore, also driven  South  African  companies  to  establish  offshore
investment  companies  and  apply  capital  and  skills   to   do   business
internationally.  It  is,  therefore,  at  this  stage,  if  I  may  deviate
slightly, sad that under the circumstances in which we feel that  the  South
African economy and the growth rate are just coming on stream  and  starting
to move, there was another hike in the repo rate by the Governor of  the  SA
Reserve Bank.

We feel it is important to look at other possibilities, and not at just  the
repo rate. I think the focus in the future should not only be  on  inflation
targeting but much more on South Africa targeting the  devaluation  and  the
increase of exchange rates, and particularly the vulnerability of the  South
African rand. I think that we could achieve much more in South Africa if  we
started focusing on fixing the exchange rate  and  particularly  at  certain
levels, rather than focusing so much on the inflation rate.

Dr P J RABIE:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  this  Bill  will
provide a modern legal framework for the equity unit  trust,  property  unit
trust and participation mortgage bond scheme industries. It is important  to
note that the first piece of legislation for  the  regulation  of  the  unit
trust industry was promulgated in 1947, and it is very important  to  update
legislation regarding this particular sector of the economy.

This piece of legislation will enable  the  local  unit  trust  industry  to
remain competitive and to keep abreast of international developments  within
the industry. A number of roleplayers participated in finalising this  Bill.
Allow me to refer to the Association of Unit Trusts of SA - their input  was
noteworthy - and a number  of  institutions  rendered  valuable  service  in
finalising this particular Bill.

This  Bill  provides  for  the  control  and  integration  of  international
financial markets. It also makes  a  significant  contribution  in  that  it
opens avenues to local investors in foreign jurisdictions and  also  enables
a number of foreign  financial  institutions  to  solicit  investments  from
local investments. This Bill provides adequate prudential  requirements  for
inclusion in the regulatory net of  other  types  of  collective  investment
schemes.

The Collective Investment Schemes Control Bill must  also  be  seen  in  the
global context, especially since September 11. All the  main  share  indices
have fallen steeply, and investment  banking  deals,  public  offerings  and
mergers - lucrative business for financial  institutions  -  have  declined,
while  job  losses  of  skilled  employees  is  an   alarmingly   persistent
international phenomenon that is reason for great concern.

It is in the interests of all roleplayers to implement this  legislation  to
allow the local unit trust industry to expand  their  competitive  position.
The tide and reversal of losses of  local  domestic  investment,  employment
opportunities and revenue is another reason for grave concern.

Supervision and investor protection must also be accentuated.  South  Africa
cannot afford  what  happened  in  India  on  31  August,  when  the  Indian
government had to bail out the biggest financial institution or  unit  trust
institution in India, namely the Unit Trust of India. That particular  bail-
out will cost the Indian taxpayer something like $3 billion. So it  is  very
important that we have proactive legislation such as that contained in  this
particular Bill.

Die effektetrustbedryf is van sleutelbelang vir  aftreefondse  en  die  skep
van  welvaart.  Welvaart  en  ekonomiese  groei  kan  slegs  geskied  as  'n
normatiewe en waarderaamwerk bestaan waar hierdie sektor  van  die  ekonomie
transaksies kan beklink. Volgens die Nuwe NP  voldoen  die  wetsontwerp  aan
die voorafgaande vereistes en ons steun  hierdie  wetsontwerp.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The unit trust industry is of key importance to retirement  funds  and  the
creation of wealth.  Prosperity  and  economic  growth  can  only  occur  if
normative and value frameworks exist where this sector of  the  economy  can
clinch some of the economic transactions. According to the New NP  the  Bill
meets the preceding requirements and we support this Bill.]

Mr N M NENE: Chairperson, hon members,  the  Collective  Investment  Schemes
Control Bill is one  of  the  measures  through  which  the  ANC  Government
continues to create an environment conducive to the  equitable  distribution
of wealth in  this  country,  as  envisaged  in  the  Freedom  Charter,  the
Reconstruction and  Development  Programme  and  our  current  macroeconomic
policy.

Allow me first to explain what a  collective  investment  scheme  is  in  my
language.
Uhlelo lolu lokonga imali oluvumela abantu abanezinhloso  ezifanayo  zokonga
ukuba bahlanganise izimali zabo enqolobaneni eyodwa  ukuze  ikhiqize  inzalo
ngaphansi kwehlo longoti kwezokonga. Singasho  nje  kafishane  ukuthi  yinto
ethi ayibe sasitokifela noma umfelandawonye. (Translation of Zulu  paragraph
follows.)

[This is a scheme of investing money that allows people who  have  the  same
objective of investing to put their money in the same account,  so  that  it
produces interest under the supervision of investment experts. We could  say
that, in short, it is almost like a ``stokvel'' or collective investment.]

The  investors  in  a  portfolio  do  not  purchase  the  underlying  assets
directly, and ownership of the assets is divided into units  of  entitlement
or a participatory interest. The number of units acquired by  each  investor
depends on the unit purchase price at the time the investment was  made  and
the amount of funds invested. The return on investment  is  usually  in  the
form of dividends and capital appreciation derived from the pool  of  assets
underlying the fund. Investments can therefore be made either as lump  sums,
monthly instalments or annual instalments, or both.

The history of the collective investment scheme has already been  explained.
Briefly, it started in London in the  1860s  for  the  purposes  of  raising
funds for the British colonial government. In the 1920s it was  launched  in
the United States and became popular in the  late  1950s.  In  1965  it  was
launched in South Africa and grew tremendously in the 1990s.

We are informed that total  assets  under  the  control  of  all  registered
management companies are in excess of R106 billion. Of these, 21% is in  the
hands of institutions and 79% is in the retail industry. Data from  the  All
Media Product Survey 2001 shows that only 1,75% of this is in the  hands  of
blacks, and ownership according to household income is just as  skewed.  For
reasons that have already been mentioned by previous speakers, some  changes
have had to be effected in order to allow for an equitable  distribution  of
wealth.

One of the major changes is found in clause 2 of this Bill, which  sets  the
ground rules for the manager to act honestly and  fairly  with  skill,  care
and diligence in the interests of investors  and  the  industry.  Assets  of
investors must also be segregated.

Clause 3 deals with the  disclosure  of  information  about  the  investment
objectives of the scheme,  the  calculation  of  the  net  asset  value  and
dealing prices, charges, risk factors, and distribution of  income  accruals
must also be  disclosed  to  the  investor.  Information  that  the  manager
considers necessary to enable the investor  to  make  an  informed  decision
must also be given  to  the  investor  timeously  and  in  a  comprehensible
manner.

Clause 4 deals with the duties  of  the  manager.  The  manager  must  avoid
conflict between the interests of the  manager  and  the  interests  of  the
investor. The manager must also disclose the interests of the directors  and
management  to  the  investors.  He  or  she  must  also  maintain  adequate
financial resources to meet its commitments  and  to  manage  the  risks  to
which its collective investment scheme is exposed.

The manager is also required to organise  the  collective  investment  in  a
responsible manner; keep proper records;  employ  adequately  trained  staff
and ensure that they are properly supervised; have  well-defined  compliance
procedures; maintain an open and co-operative relationship with  the  office
of the registrar and inform this office  promptly  of  anything  that  might
reasonably be expected to  be  disclosed;  and,  lastly,  the  manager  must
promote investor education, either directly or through initiatives taken  by
the association.

It is envisaged that this kind  of  education  for  investors,  if  properly
done, will bring on board  the  previously  disadvantaged  and  improve  the
savings levels in our economy as  this  is  one  of  the  safest  investment
vehicles, especially in the current economic climate.

Let me take this opportunity to invite the members of this  House  to  study
this piece of legislation and  to  carry  the  message  forward  that  their
Government has delivered once again.

The ANC supports this Bill, and I also want  to  take  this  opportunity  to
thank  the  Financial  Services  Board,  the  Treasury  and  all  the  other
participants for coming up with this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Chairperson and hon members, the Bill before us  represents
the most comprehensive piece of legislation  to  date  with  regard  to  the
regulation and supervision of the collective investment schemes industry  in
this country.

The first unit trust and participation bond legislation came into  being  55
years ago and was consolidated in the current Act in  1981.  Since  then  we
have seen a number of amendments to collective investment schemes.  In  1997
it was  realised  that  a  major  update  was  needed  to  bring  the  legal
environment into line with international best practice.
The revised Bill before the House started out with workshops that were  held
in 1999, followed by further  consultations  and  amendments  in  2000.  The
result is the very comprehensive and well-researched Bill before us.

During June 2002, it was  estimated  that  South  African  unit  trusts  had
assets under management  to  the  value  of  nearly  R134  billion.  It  is,
furthermore,  estimated  that  R88  billion  of  South  African  funds  were
invested in foreign countries  in  June  2002.  It  is,  indeed,  a  massive
industry.

In my opinion, the major  aim  of  this  Bill  is  to  open  the  collective
investment industry as a savings vehicle for  the  ordinary  person  in  the
street. Hopefully, it  will  be  user-friendly  and  provide  the  necessary
information to the public, including the minimum  lump  sums  required,  the
monthly investment fees, etc.

The purpose of the Bill is to bring collective investment schemes  into  the
regulatory net  and,  thereby,  not  allow  another  Masterbond  tragedy  to
happen. One either regulates it or one bans  it.  The  Deputy  Minister  has
referred to this.

Taking into consideration  the  aim  of  this  Bill  and  its  comprehensive
nature, it is notable  that  stokvels  fall  outside  collective  investment
schemes legislation, and the Deputy Minister may  want  to  indicate  to  us
whether  it  is  his  intention  to  eventually  include  stokvels  in   the
legislation.

The UDM has no hesitation in supporting the  Collective  Investment  Schemes
Control  Bill  and  congratulates  the  FSB,  the  Treasury  and  all  other
roleplayers on a neat piece of legislation. [Applause.]

Mr D A HANEKOM: Chairperson, I must admit I was not  completely  ready  with
my speech. I was talking to Sue over there and ...

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Use mine.

Mr D A HANEKOM: No, I would never use yours, Trevor. Sue said,  ``Why  don't
you start with something exciting like: `Forward  to  collective  investment
schemes, forward!''' [Interjections.] [Laughter.]  Yes,  yes.  I  just  knew
that would work.

Chairperson, that is what we are dealing with today,  and  the  reason  that
you do not have such good audience participation is  because  no  one  knows
exactly what collective investment schemes are. But, as  they  sit  here,  a
number of them have money invested in  what  were  formerly  known  as  unit
trusts.

I do not know about the Minister, because he has never  really  revealed  to
me where he invests his money. Once upon a time he told me that he  actually
does not have any money to invest. That  is  his  real  problem.  But  other
members here do, and they do have some of their savings in unit trusts.

We know what the term unit trusts means, but  actually  it  is  not  an  apt
term, because what we  are  dealing  with  here  are  collective  investment
schemes. Some of our communists here would actually like  the  term  because
it talks about collective action. It is not just about one  investing  one's
money as an individual, it is investing it together - doing things  together
- for the best possible returns. That is what collective investment  schemes
are about, actually.

Hon members would be surprised to know that we  have  R200  billion  in  our
country tied up in collective investment schemes. Two  million  people  have
their money invested in collective investment schemes. So  this  is  a  very
significant thing that we are dealing with here. It is growing at  the  rate
of 29% per annum, and it is growing because it has proved to  be  successful
- a very good way of investing one's money.

The Bill we are dealing with is all about regulation. So  the  role  of  the
regulator becomes very important, not in order to overregulate - to make  it
difficult for people or make it difficult for the industry - but  to  ensure
that  investors'  interests  are  protected.  It  is  all   about   consumer
protection.

The things that we do in this House are very important. It is like  a  chess
game. We put the little pieces in place and the result is success,  economic
success. All the little pieces are very important. When one  considers  that
R200 billion is tied up  in  collective  investments,  the  appropriate  and
effective type of regulations become very important. It  is  very  important
that investors can feel safe with their investments and that this  industry,
which offers such benefits, continues to grow.

Now what are these benefits? Well, one of the benefits is that  one  is  not
burdened with the administration that one  might  have  when  one  goes  and
invests money somewhere else  individually,  because  one  has  a  portfolio
manager who assists. So one has the benefit  of  experienced  and  qualified
portfolio managers that do the investment  on  one's  behalf,  but  one  is,
clearly, one of many.

It is not just one's money being invested, it is many people's  money  being
invested, and that has an advantage. It means that one has a certain  buying
power with one's money that one would not have if it  were  just  one's  own
R500, and because one's R500 becomes R10 million or R100 million,  there  is
buying power.

This also means, in terms of the way the system works, that one  can  redeem
this money at any point. So it is not tied up and difficult to get hold  of;
it can be redeemed. The interest rates have  been  quite  high  and  returns
have been high, but it is highly redeemable. Now those  are  very  important
things to investors.

I think I have actually said enough. I am sure all hon members  support  the
Collective Investment Schemes Control Bill. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, personally I have not got much  interest  in  this
Bill. A Bill regulating overdrafts would  be  of  much  more  value  to  me.
[Laughter.]

Die publiek is geregtig op sekerheid en  beskerming  wanneer  hul  geld  aan
beleggersmaatskappye  toevertrou  word.  Soos  die   mediese   beroep,   die
regsberoep en die ingenieursberoep, moet ook  die  beleggingsberoep  volgens
ordelike re√´ls geskied. Dit geld by uitstek die bedryf  van  eenheidstrusts,
aangesien laasgenoemde by uitstek 'n terrein is wat beleggers  betree  omdat
hulle self  nie  oor  die  nodige  kundigheid  beskik  om  self  individuele
beleggingskeuses te maak nie.

As  'n  mens  ook  kyk  na  die  onrusbarende  verskynsel   van   bedenklike
beleggingskemas  waar   duisende   goedgelowige   lede   van   die   publiek
swaarverdiende geld verloor het, kan  ordelike  regulering  van  die  totale
beleggingsveld alleen maar verwelkom word en sal ons ook bly wees as dit  na
daardie veld uitgebrei kan word.

Die AEB is van oortuiging  dat  die  maatre√´ls  wat  met  hierdie  wetgewing
ingestel word die bedryf sal baat en die publiek  ten  goede  sal  kom.  Die
wetgewing sal lei  tot  die  volgende,  onder  meer:  groter  sekuriteit  en
veiligheid van  beleggings  deur  die  verpligte  verspreiding  van  risiko;
groter     vaartbelyning     deurdat     die     bedryf     'n      ordelike
selfreguleringsinstrument    daarstel;    professionalisering    van     die
bemarkingbedryf,   deurdat   fly-by-nights   uitgeskakel   word    en    die
professionaliteit waarop die publiek geregtig is, bereik  kan  word;  groter
kompeteerbaarheid   deurdat   internasionale   tendense   en    ontwikkeling
verdiskonteer word;  en  groter  ...  Ekskuus,  Minister?   (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The public is entitled to certainty and  protection  when  their  money  is
entrusted to investor companies. Like  the  medical  profession,  the  legal
profession and the engineering profession,  the  investors  profession  also
has to take place according to orderly rules. This applies in particular  to
the unit trusts' industry, as the latter is pre-eminently a terrain  entered
by investors because they themselves do not have the necessary knowledge  to
make individual investment decisions.

If one also looks at the disconcerting  phenomenon  of  precarious  investor
schemes, in which thousands of credulous members of  the  public  have  lost
hard-earned money, the orderly regulation of  the  entire  investment  field
can only be welcomed and we will also appreciate if it could be extended  to
that field.

The AEB is of the conviction that the measures that are being introduced  by
this legislation will benefit the industry and be in the best  interests  of
the public. The legislation will lead to the following, inter alia:  greater
investment security and safety through the compulsory distributing of  risk;
greater streamlining by the industry  creating  an  orderly  self-regulating
instrument; professionalising of the marketing industry, by eliminating fly-
by-nights and the professionality to which the public is  entitled,  can  be
achieved; greater competitiveness through discounting  international  trends
and development; and greater ... I beg your pardon, Minister?]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Mededingendheid. [Competitiveness.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Mededingendheid. Dankie,  goeie  Afrikaans  vir  die  Minister.
[Competitiveness. Thank you, good Afrikaans on the part of the Minister.]

Groter deursigtigheid - is die woord reg? - waarop die publiek geregtig  is.
Die AEB vertrou dat hierdie wetgewing besparing sal aanmoedig. Ons voel  net
jammer dat hierdie wet ter tafel kom juis op 'n stadium waar  daar  weer  'n
verhoging in die rentekoerse kom. Die drastiese verhoging die afgelope  paar
jaar veroorsaak dat al  hoe  minder  lede  van  die  publiek  hierdie  goeie
wetgewing gaan nodig kry, aangesien nie veel geld vir besparing oorbly nie.

Die AEB verwelkom ook die beginsel van selfregulering in die bedryf  en  ons
steun  graag  hierdie  wetgewing.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Greater transparency - is that the correct word - to which  the  public  is
entitled. The AEB trusts that this legislation will  encourage  savings.  We
just have a measure of regret that this law is being  tabled  exactly  at  a
stage when another increase in the interest rate is  looming.  The  dramatic
increase over the last couple of years is the cause of  even  fewer  members
of the public that are going to need this legislation, because not a lot  of
money is left over for savings.

The AEB also welcomes the principle of self-regulating in the  industry  and
we gladly support this legislation.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I would like to thank  all  the
members for their participation in this debate and support for the Bill.

Quite clearly this  is  a  Bill  around  which  there  has  been  a  lot  of
convergence, and I think it is important to make the point that the week  in
which we are debating this Bill is actually South African  Savings  Week.  I
believe that the debates that we have had on this Bill should  go  some  way
towards promoting a culture of savings in South Africa. I just want  to  say
to the hon Derek Hanekom that his ill-prepared speeches have  actually  done
a lot for Savings Week.

The one issue I want to pick up on is the issue around some of  the  remarks
that the Minister of Finance may  have  made  at  Nedlac  on  South  African
institutions and the fact that they are discriminatory  or  exclusionary.  I
think it is important for us to address this issue because it represents  an
ongoing challenge in the South African context, and making  those  kinds  of
statements is not equal to running down our financial institutions. I  think
our record speaks for itself.

The point about South Africa is that economic growth  in  South  Africa  is,
necessarily, about ensuring that more and more  people  can  participate  in
mainstream economic activities. At the centre of that stands  the  issue  of
access to  finance  and  the  role  of  financial  institutions.  Whilst  we
continue to look for ways and means in which  we  can  assist,  essentially,
black people to have better access  to  financial  services,  we  can  never
forget to say to our financial institutions that it is an ongoing  challenge
for them as well to make sure  that  they  do  more  to  promote  access  to
financial services.

The other point I want to pick up on is that  we  should  try  not  to  have
short memories when we  are  facing  particular  problems  in  our  economic
environment. We know that  there  has  been  a  lot  of  concern  about  the
increase in interest rates, which were increased yesterday once more by  one
percentage point.

We must also not forget that  we  have  important  objectives  in  terms  of
controlling inflation in South Africa, because it is  in  the  interests  of
our people to control inflation. It is particularly in the interests of  the
poor people to control inflation, because it protects  the  value  of  their
meagre incomes. So, I think, we must try to be more measured and not  forget
that there have been attempts in the past to target the  exchange  rate.  We
must look at what that experience is. So let us not just look  at  targeting
inflation.

Finally, I would just like to say  that  we  have  some  students  from  the
University of Venda in the gallery.  We  would  like  to  welcome  them  and
acknowledge their presence. [Applause.] We hope that sitting in  on  debates
such as these will  help  to  give  them  greater  exposure  to  the  issues
confronting the country. [Applause.]

                SOUTH AFRICAN REVENUE SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon members, Sars was  established  as
an organ of state  on  1  October  1997,  and  there  is  a  very  important
provision in the Act  which  describes  Sars  as  being  within  the  public
administration but outside the Public Service. So  Sars  as  a  creature  of
statute has had the administrative autonomy and the flexibility to  be  able
to employ and design systems to ensure that it can maximally  live  out  its
mandate.

We have had five years within  which  to  observe  what  this  new  kind  of
institution is, and the amendments we seek in this  Bill  are,  essentially,
drawing on the experience of five years of intensive learning.

Firstly, there is an amendment that deals with the inclusion of the  customs
function. So it is not just about  the  collection  of  revenues,  but  also
control over the  movement  of  goods  which  is  important.  Secondly,  the
interrelationship between the customs function and  the  trade  function  is
the reason why the Deputy Minister of Finance and  the  Deputy  Minister  of
Trade and Industry are in intense consultations  today.  It  is  about  that
important function.

Let me just digress for a moment and say that the spokesman for the  milling
industry is completely out of order with his  attacks.  We  can  demonstrate
that the applications for tariff adjustments  came  very  late.  There  have
been no hold-ups in Sars, but Sars' improving on trade  facilitation  is  an
important  function  and  that  is  taken  account  of,  certainly,  in  the
amendments before us.

The amendments also seek to align Sars as an entity - which is in part A  of
schedule 3 of the Public Finance Management Act - with  the  Public  Finance
Management Act. There is an amendment which seeks that Cabinet  be  involved
in the appointment of the commissioner. And  then  there  are  two  sets  of
issues that have been the subject of intense debate in  the  committee.  The
first is the disestablishment of the Sars Board - and  this  is  drawn  from
five years of intense learning, as I have  said  -  and  in  its  stead  the
establishment of specialist committees, some in permanent sitting  and  some
on an ad hoc basis. That matter was debated quite extensively.

The other issue relates to the method of funding, and the  amendment  sought
here is that whilst recognising that Sars  will  remain  a  contender  in  a
competitive  bidding  process  to  secure  revenues  from  the  Fiscus,  the
proposal - and this is a proposal - creates a possibility  for  Sars  to  be
funded on a percentage of revenues  earned  basis.  It  does  not  call  for
immediate implementation. This is something  that  would  require  the  full
involvement of both the Ministry and Cabinet, and, clearly, it is  something
that would require the concurrence of Parliament as well. But the  provision
is made.

I want to be very clear about the  fact  that  this  is  not  about  strange
incentives created for bounty hunters. We believe that Sars fulfils  a  very
important function in delivering democracy to people  by  ensuring  that  we
can collect revenues from those who ought to be contributing to the Fiscus.

The last amendment is the alignment of Sars and its pension  fund  with  the
norms of the Government Employees' Pension Fund.

I have great pleasure in placing the Sars Amendment Bill before this  House.
[Applause.]

Ms B A HOGAN: Chair, I do not intend  to  repeat  what  the  Minister  said.
There are only a couple of amendments to this Bill, which he  went  into  in
great depth and detail. He also addressed the issues that were a  matter  of
some debate within our committee. I do not believe that  this  House  should
be subject to constant repetitions on the same  matters.  My  colleague  Mrs
Joemat has the unenviable task of spelling out the ANC's  position  on  this
Bill, and she is sitting there ready to do so.

So it is my pleasure to say that  the  ANC  supports  this  Bill  and  looks
forward to the SA Revenue Service improving the already improved quality  of
work they do for this country. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, ... [Interjections.] Yes, I could not rely  on
you to interpret the meaning of that, I am afraid.

Madam Speaker, hon members, when the SA Revenue Service Act was  adopted  in
1997, it marked the culmination of a long  and  arduous  process  to  ensure
that a moribund organisation could be allowed  maximum  operational  freedom
and administrative autonomy to turn itself around.
The aim was to create an efficient and effective administration  of  revenue
collection systems. This required substantive organisational  re-engineering
of the Revenue Service, including the establishment of an advisory board  to
advise both the commissioner and the Minister of Finance.

The  positive  results  of  this  process  are  clear  to  see.   Sars   has
consistently exceeded and collected more than its target  revenue  over  the
past few years.  In  this  context  any  steps  aimed  at  improving  and/or
removing  ambiguities  or  inconsistencies  in   the   legal   institutional
framework, within which we expect  an  efficient  and  accountable  Sars  to
function, must be supported.

With the adoption of the Public Finance Management Act  in  1999,  the  need
arose to align the accountability arrangements in the Sars  Act  with  those
contained in the PFMA.

Under the pre-PFMA dispensation, Sars performed its functions and  exercised
its powers under the policy  directives  and  control  of  the  Minister  of
Finance. With the advent of the new PFMA, the  rationale  for  these  policy
directives has  fallen  away  as  the  relationship  between  the  executive
authority and the accounting officer has been  spelt  out  in  much  clearer
terms in the new legislation.

Although legitimate questions arise in relation to the desirability  of  the
new provision for the President to appoint the head  of  Sars,  which  is  a
schedule 3 national public entity according to the PFMA, the removal of  the
policy directive provisions is supported.

Since its inception, the Sars advisory board appears to have been  a  hybrid
institution exercising a board function over an entity that is described  in
the Sars Act as an organ of state within the public  administration  but  as
an institution outside the Public Service. With twenty-twenty hindsight  and
in practice the more conventionally conceived board function seems  to  have
been ill suited to Sars.  The  Bill  before  us  today  abolishes  the  Sars
advisory board and  creates  statutory  specialist  advisory  committees  to
advise both the Minister of Finance and the Commissioner of Sars.

The doctrine of new public management dictates the need for clear  lines  of
accountability and responsibility. The PFMA was an  important  step  on  the
new public management path.

While there is certainly a case to be made for the existence  of  specialist
advisory committees, there are,  equally,  legitimate  questions  about  the
wisdom of providing for such committees as creatures of statute  instead  of
leaving them to be  creatures  of  the  commissioner's  discretion,  in  the
context of the accountability clarity  which  the  doctrine  of  new  public
management and the PFMA seek to establish.

While it is not a certainty that any interference  and/or  blurring  of  the
lines will necessarily happen, it will entirely depend on the nature of  any
future incumbent Minister of  Finance  and  Commissioner  of  Sars.  As  the
decision has been taken to place the committees in  the  new  Bill,  the  DA
wishes to highlight these potential difficulties alluded to above.

However, it is important to note that the proposed advisory committees  will
have more circumscribed powers than those of  the  existing  advisory  board
that is disestablished in terms of this Bill.

The Bill before us broadens the objectives  and  functions  of  Sars,  apart
from revenue collection, to adequately cover the  exercise  of  customs  and
excise functions. This greater accountability and legal  certainty  must  be
welcomed.

The amendment to section 25 of the principal  Act  contained  in  this  Bill
creates an enabling provision to allow  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  the
Commissioner of Sars to agree to another method of funding between them  and
for that then to be approved  by  Cabinet.  This  broad  enabling  provision
opens the door to a number of potential policy measures, including  the  one
highlighted by the Minister of  retaining  a  certain  fixed  percentage  of
revenue collected and using it for operations.
Clearly, the needs are considerable in the changeover process under  Siyakha
I and II, but surely these can still be  catered  for  under  the  estimates
process and not  through  controversial-potential  incentives  through  this
broad enabling provision, which we create and we believe is  superfluous  as
it can be catered for under the estimates process.

It is of concern that on a Bill of  this  nature  we  did  not  receive  any
public comment. Good lawmaking requires civil society to be engaged  in  the
legislative process. We do believe that it was regrettable that we  received
no such comment.

The sound functioning of Sars, however, is and  remains  the  life-blood  of
public policy delivery, and the DA takes pleasure in supporting  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, Sars is the jewel  in  the  Minister's  crown.
They have done extremely well. It is due to them that it has  been  possible
for a lot of tax savings  to  be  passed  on  to  consumers  and  people  in
general. However, this Bill deals specifically with some additional  aspects
that were encountered by Sars and which needed to be rectified.

Sedert die afkondiging van die Suid-Afrikaanse Inkomstedienswet in 1997  het
'n hele paar faktore aanleiding gegee dat sekere van die bepalings  van  die
wet hersien moet word. 'n Belangrike faktor is die afkondiging van  die  Wet
op Openbare Finansi√´le Bestuur in 1999, wat die finansi√´le  bestuur  in  die
nasionale Regering sowel as die provinsiale regerings re√´l. Dit is  'n  baie
belangrike aspek wat in hierdie aangeleentheid ingesluit moet word.

Ander praktiese probleme met betrekking tot die huidige  bepalings  van  die
SA Inkomstedienswet is ook ge√Ødentifiseer en sekere van di√©  bepalings  word
dan ook in hierdie wetgewing hersien. Hoewel die SA  Inkomstediens  aan  die
Minister van Finansies verslag doen en  inkomstewetgewing  administreer  wat
die verantwoordelikheid van die Minister  is,  is  daar  vanuit  'n  doeane-
oogpunt 'n verbintenis met die Departement van Handel en  Nywerheid.  Verder
is daar die tariefwysigings, en spesifiek ten opsigte van di√© wat  deur  die
Departement van Handel en Nywerheid versoek en ge√Ømplementeer word,  en  dan
is daar ook  die  aansporingskemas  wat  geadministreer  word  en  deur  die
Departement van Handel en Nywerheid ontwikkel word om handel aan te help  en
ekonomiese groei te stimuleer.

In hierdie verband vervul die  SA  Inkomstediens  ook  die  funksie  om  die
Minister van  Handel  en  Nywerheid  te  adviseer  aangaande  aangeleenthede
rakende die beheer oor invoer, uitvoer, beweging,  opslag  en  verbruik  van
sekere goedere. Hierdie wetsontwerp stel derhalwe 'n  wysiging  aan  die  SA
Inkomstedienswet voor om hierdie  funksie  te  weerspie√´l.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Since the promulgation of the South African Revenue Service  Act  in  1997,
quite a number of factors led to the need for certain of the  provisions  of
the Act to be reviewed. An important  factor  is  the  promulgation  of  the
Public  Finance  Management  Act  in  1999  that  regulates  the   financial
management  in  the  national  Government  as   well   as   the   provincial
governments. This is a very important aspect  that  should  be  included  in
this matter.

Other practical problems with regard to the current provisions of the  South
African Revenue Act were also identified and  certain  of  these  provisions
are also being reviewed with this legislation. Even though Sars  reports  to
the Minister of Finance and administers revenue legislation,  which  is  the
responsibility of the Minister, there is a connection  with  the  Department
of Trade and Industry from a customs point of view. Further, there  are  the
tariff amendments, specifically with regard to  those  that  were  requested
and are implemented by the Department of Trade and Industry, and then  there
are also the motivating schemes that must be administered and are  developed
by the Department of Trade and Industry in order  to  facilitate  trade  and
stimulate economic growth.

In this regard Sars fulfils also the function of advising  the  Minister  of
Trade and Industry with  regard  to  matters  relating  to  the  control  of
import, export, movement, oversight and consumption of certain  goods.  This
Bill therefore introduces an amendment to the South African Revenue  Act  in
order to reflect this function.]

The importance of this particular aspect is clearly being indicated  by  the
problems that we have recently experienced with Romatex when they  tried  to
settle in the Eastern Cape. It was owing to the fact that  these  pieces  of
legislation were not in place that we probably lost the Romatex investment.

But the important thing is that with this  legislation  in  place,  one  can
probably renegotiate with Romatex. I understand that there is a  possibility
that Romatex and several other organisations would perhaps reconsider  their
position, and particularly that these  incentive  schemes  could  be  pushed
through. However, it is of the utmost importance that  these  be  controlled
and properly legislated.

The IFP will definitely support this Bill.
Dr  P  J  RABIE:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  Sars   was
established as an organ of state on 1 October 1997. What  is  noteworthy  is
that Sars is a juristic entity within the public administration but  outside
the Public Service.

A number of significant amendments are included in this Bill.  Allow  me  to
mention two of them. First and foremost is the disestablishment of the  Sars
board and the establishment of a number of specialist  committees;  and  the
second is the membership of the Government Employees' Pension Fund.

The current wording of the Act concentrates on the  collection  of  revenue.
Following the amalgamation of  customs  and  revenue,  Sars  has  added  the
important  proactive  function  of  control  regarding  import  and   export
movement of manufactured goods, storage, etc.

When the Sars Act was implemented, the Public  Finance  Management  Act  had
not  yet   been   introduced.   The   PFMA   ensures   effective   financial
accountability, which resulted in a  number  of  clauses  in  the  Sars  Act
becoming obsolete, such as clauses 1(b) and 1(c) in particular.

The present Sars Act provides for the establishment of a Sars  board,  which
is only an advisory and not a consultative  body.  Clause  18  proposes  the
disestablishment of the board, and  clause  8  proposes  that  the  Minister
establish one or more specialist committees to advise the  commissioner  and
the Minister regarding asset management,  human  resources  and  information
technology.

Regarding the membership of  the  Government  Employees'  Pension  Fund,  at
present the Sars Act  requires  all  employees  to  become  members  of  the
Government Employees' Pension Fund. The Government Employees'  Pension  Fund
excludes certain persons, for example certain contract  workers.  What  this
Bill proposes, in fact, is that the Sars Act be aligned with the  Government
Employees' Pension Fund.

The Commissioner of Revenue mentioned to the Portfolio Committee on  Finance
that the Revenue Service is recruiting highly  skilled  employees  from  the
private  sector,  which  will  add  to  the  capacity  of  this   particular
department. This amendment will enable  Sars  to  compete  at  an  effective
level with the private sector.

The  effective  collection  of  revenue  is  of  crucial  importance.   This
technical Bill will benefit all  role-players.  The  New  NP  supports  this
Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker and hon members, the new SA  Revenue  Service
celebrates  its  fifth  birthday  in  2002.  Let  me  use,  therefore,  this
opportunity to congratulate the Commissioner of the SA Revenue  Service,  Mr
Pravin Gordhan, and his staff on a sterling performance during  this  period
of time. He has taken Sars to new heights and we,  as  South  Africans,  are
proud of this institution - and, I may add - despite the fact that Sars  has
become the senior partner in most households and businesses.

In my opinion the most important amendment in the Bill before us relates  to
the expansion of functions. The Bill incorporates customs  functions  as  an
additional objective of Sars. These functions relate  to  the  control  over
the import, export, manufacture, movement, storage or use of certain  goods,
which are performed by the customs administration division within Sars.

I am informed that, currently,  controls  are  inadequate  at  a  number  of
harbours and airports. Sars is, for example, relying  on  the  documentation
of clearing agents relating to all imports and  exports  at  the  Cape  Town
harbour, owing to the fact that Sars does not have the available personnel.

We also know that the fuel levy generates  substantial  revenue  at  customs
and excise in Cape Town  harbour,  which  means  that  Sars  should  perform
audits at the oil companies. The question is: Do they have the  capacity  to
do exactly that?

I therefore appeal to the  Minister  and  the  commissioner  to  create  the
capacity within Sars to perform these  additional  customs  functions.  Only
then will this amendment be effective.

The UDM supports the South African Revenue Service Amendment Bill.

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Madam Speaker, hon members, in 1994 the new  ANC  Government
inherited  a  SA  Revenue  Service  that  was   institutionally   weak   and
ineffective in raising  the  levels  of  revenue  required  to  rebuild  our
country. In order to revitalise Sars it was necessary for  Sars  to  attract
the necessary cadre of professional staff and, in doing  so,  transform  the
organisation from an archaic white elephant to a revenue collector of note.

The Sars Act of 1997 thus placed Sars outside the limitations of the  Public
Service,  but   still   within   the   public   administration,   that   is,
administrative independence with political accountability.

As an ANC member of Parliament I am indeed proud to be associated  with  the
transformation of Sars. It has been transformed into a  national  asset.  It
is our revenue-raising breadbasket through which  this  ANC  Government  has
delivered, and will continue to deliver, services for our people.

However, as politicians responsible for the political oversight of Sars,  we
cannot rest on our laurels. We need to  sustain,  enhance  and  improve  its
operational efficiency so that future generations can also benefit from  the
revenue-raising potential.

The Sars amendment Bill before this House today should be understood  within
this context and not based on narrowly  defined  party-political  interests.
Sars is intensifying its capacity to  prosecute  tax  defaulters.  Qualified
legal officers are being appointed at regional and local offices to  bolster
Sars' legal muscle.

Sars  has  achieved  considerable   success   in   its   tax-base-broadening
initiative aimed at registering persons, businesses  and  employers  and  at
reducing the rate of noncompliance with  tax  legislation.  The  passing  of
this Bill will give Sars greater administrative autonomy and allow  Sars  to
have better control over its resources.

I wish to reiterate - and in line with  the  vision  of  Sars  -  that  Sars
become an innovative revenue  and  customs  agency  that  enhances  economic
growth and social development, and which supports our nations's  integration
into a global economy in a way that benefits all South Africans.

During the past five years the model under which Sars has operated has  been
very successful, but it now requires amendment. Legislation is  not  static;
it needs to be amended from time to  time.  With  hindsight  the  amendments
proposed deal with these realignments and will  improve  the  administration
of Sars.

There are approximately and broadly  speaking  seven  amendments.  Regarding
the objectives of Sars, the current wording  emphasises  the  collection  of
revenue, but following the amalgamation of customs and revenue, we  need  to
align the legislation to incorporate the functions of customs  dealing  with
customs matters as well.

Regarding the functions of Sars, the  incorporation  of  customs  into  Sars
will require greater synergy between Sars and the Department  of  Trade  and
Industry. These amendments will ensure a  working  legislative  relationship
(?) and serve to advise the Minister of Trade and Industry - as he enters  -
and the industry on policy relating to matters affecting the  industry;  and
they will ensure the  linkage  between  customs,  administration  and  trade
policy.

Thirdly, consequential amendments are proposed to bring Sars  in  line  with
the PFMA. The  Act  at  present  provides  that  the  Minister  appoint  the
commissioner. The proposal in this amendment is to bring Sars in  line  with
the  appointment  of  heads  of   national   departments.   Therefore,   the
commissioner will be appointed by Cabinet through the President.

The  existing  board  needs  to  be  disestablished  and  replaced  with   a
specialist committee. The  Minister  may  appoint  one  or  more  specialist
committees. The main purpose of this specialist committee is to  advise  the
Minister  and  the  commissioner  on  the  management  of  Sars   resources,
including  assets,  management,  human   resources   and   information   and
technology.

In terms of the Constitution, a specialist committee established  by  clause
11 must perform its  functions  impartially  and  without  fear,  favour  or
prejudice.

Regarding methods of funding, section 25 of the Act provides that  its  main
source of income is derived  from  money  appropriated  by  Parliament.  The
amount is  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  estimates  of  income  and
expenditure prepared by Sars, which are prescribed  in  the  Sars  Act,  but
which are also regulated in terms of the PFMA.

The Bill before us provides  an  amendment  in  order  to  provide  that  an
alternative method of determining Sars funds may be agreed  to  between  the
Minister and the commissioner, that it will be subject to  the  approval  of
Cabinet and that the funds will be appropriated by Parliament.

As members have heard, these amendments will  contribute  to  the  efficient
and effective functioning of Sars. The ANC supports this Bill. I would  like
to end by saying: ``Viva Sars, Viva!'' [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, hon members, there is  no  need  for
me to filibuster any more as Alec Erwin has arrived. So all I need to do  is
say thank you to all parties for supporting the legislation.

I would like  to  make  just  two  brief  comments.  The  first  relates  to
something that the hon Bekker said earlier. If one looks at  countries  that
have found themselves in a deep crisis - one can look at Turkey;  Argentina;
Thailand; Brazil, until the beginning of last year; Indonesia; and I  invite
members to watch the situation in Ecuador - the one thing they  all  had  in
common was that their currencies were pegged. So  let  us  just  be  careful
about the kind of advice we give, because  I  would  rather  deal  with  the
situation we are dealing with now than be faced with the need to go  cap  in
hand to Washington to borrow huge sums of money. This is just an  invitation
that we deal with that.

Secondly, I would like to say to the hon Taljaard that we did invite  public
comment, and the only comment we got was from certain sectors  of  corporate
South Africa  who  said,  ``Do  not  disestablish  the  board;  disestablish
Sars.'' We have done with that advice what she would have  asked  of  us  to
do.

Lastly, it is the  hon  Connie  September's  daughter's  birthday.  Sabrina,
happy birthday! [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                        CORPORATE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)
The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam  Speaker,  may  I  thank  you  for
slightly slowing down procedures. May I also thank the Minister  of  Finance
for offering to stand in for me, and the Deputy Minister  for  panicking  on
my behalf. I am sorry I was slightly late; I was delayed. Further,  I  thank
the Whips for their leniency towards me. My back is still unscarred.

The SPEAKER: I will protect it, hon Minister

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Also, I wish Connie's daughter  a  happy
birthday.

These are relatively small amendments, but in some ways  they  herald  quite
an exciting time. As members will no doubt know,  we  have  amalgamated  the
Companies and Close Corporations Registration Offices and  the  intellectual
properties offices into Cipro, an acronym  for  Companies  and  Intellectual
Property Registration Office.

From 1 April 2002, the office, in consultation with the  National  Treasury,
was changed into a trading entity. This allows us to be  more  effective  in
our operations. We have already begun the process  of  electronic  lodgments
and a range of other important IT-driven processes, which will  improve  the
efficiency of Cipro.

The amendments, accordingly, are designed to  facilitate  this  process  and
deal with one or two other small issues. The main amendment would  allow  us
to implement the trading entity process, which allows  us  to  charge  fees,
retain those fees for the operation of the Companies Offices  and  retain  a
contingency amount at the end of the  period,  but  any  additional  amounts
that may have accumulated in the trading entity  then  go  to  the  National
Revenue Fund. These changes, therefore, will facilitate that process.

Secondly, other changes made relate  to  our  ability  to  adjust  fees  and
charge fees. These will now be done through regulation  rather  than  having
to amend the Act at each point. The third  change  of  significance,  and  I
think it is an  important  change,  is  to  strengthen  or  reintroduce  the
requirement that companies  have  to  submit  an  annual  return.  This  had
previously been dropped in the late 1980s, but from our point of view it  is
an important step forward again in creating a more effective data base  with
more information on what companies are doing,  which  sector  they  are  in,
etc.

We are also making a provision, which I think is an important provision,  to
allow companies  to  provide,  on  a  voluntary  basis,  certain  additional
information about their  operations.  As  we  see  corporate  responsibility
programmes coming  in,  as  we  see  the  whole  issues  of  black  economic
empowerment coming in, such reporting could provide a very useful source  of
information for investors, for others, for our courts  and  for  many  other
parts of our society as to what is happening in the corporate world.

I will not detain the House for much longer. These amendments, I think,  are
relatively small, but herald a new era for the  Companies  and  Intellectual
Property Registration Office, making it even  more  efficient  than  it  has
become in the last two years. [Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Madam  Speaker,  the  Corporate  Laws  Amendment  Bill  is  an
essential Bill. It seeks to amalgamate the Companies and Close  Corporations
Registration Offices with the Patents and Trade Marks  Registration  Offices
into a single office styled ``Cipro''.

The Bill further seeks to change the  manner  of  payment  for  the  service
rendered by this entity. This will enable Cipro  to  perform  its  role  and
function and to introduce  e-commerce  in  the  lodgment  of  documents  and
disclosure of corporate information. Obviously, these measures will  enhance
both the efficiency and modernisation  of  registration  procedures  in  the
corporate sector.

Investors, both domestic and foreign, will be better  served  and  serviced.
The present state of both  these  offices  leaves  much  to  be  desired.  I
experienced this in July during constituency week. I  had  to  help  someone
who travelled all the way from the Eastern Cape to register a  patent.  Time
is of the essence when it comes to matters of that magnitude.

This Bill seeks, further, to address an aspect  of  concern,  that  is,  the
unsatisfactory compliance of the Companies Act and  the  Close  Corporations
Act regarding disclosure of certain  information.  The  introduction  of  an
annual return will greatly  benefit  the  integrity  of  the  South  African
registry's data base on registered companies and  close  corporations.  This
will  further  facilitate  corporate  accountability  and   good   corporate
governance. If Cipro is to be a national public entity under the PFMA,  then
it will have tight government obligations  and  accountability  arrangements
in terms of the PFMA.

In conclusion, a crucial question I would like to ask is in  regard  to  the
progress made in the rewriting of the Companies Act. What elements, if  any,
of the King 2 report on corporate governance will become  part  of  the  new
Companies Act in order to tighten corporate governance?
The former chief  executive  of  Engen,  Rob  Angel,  has  joined  Cipro  as
management consultant, which is a key appointment, and  there  is  consensus
in the legal fraternity that  this  will  make  a  huge  difference  to  the
service.

I would also like to commend Adv Simelane,  who  promised  swift  action  in
rendering this area of DTI efficient. He asked for  three  months,  and  the
path travelled already is commendable.  Efficiency  and  speed  are  aspects
that lend an economy the agility to respond to global market  pressures.  In
that way, the DA does support this Bill. [Applause.]

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Madam Speaker, I am being pressurised into not  using  all
12 minutes of my speaking time. I am being told that  it  is  Friday  today,
that it is Friday the 13th, that members are scared to  stay  in  the  House
and that my minutes are up - all of these things.

Let me say that when we change any law, we  do  so  to  enhance  sustainable
development strategies and,  obviously,  proactive  economic  policies.  The
amendment to this  Bill  brings  out  one  of  the  targeted  areas  in  the
establishment and enhancement of small and medium  enterprises  as  vehicles
for the promotion of access  for  previously  disadvantaged  individuals  to
employment opportunities.

Any business environment with increases in cost would be detrimental to  the
development of any type of enterprise. The incorporation  of  the  Companies
and Close Corporations Registration  Offices  with  the  Patents  and  Trade
Marks Registration Offices into one single body named Cipro - the  Companies
and Intellectual Property  Registration  Office  -  can  be  regarded  as  a
positive step in the right direction.

The hon Hanekom's Bill fits nicely into this office,  because  without  this
office his Bill would not be able to operate. So it  is  important  that  he
listen to each and every sentence I say. This incorporation took place  with
the approval of the National Treasury and the SA Revenue  Service,  as  well
as with the standing advisory committee on company law.
In addition, this incorporation adheres  to  specific  financial  and  other
requirements  as  specified  by  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act.  The
intention of the incorporation was to get small  and  medium  enterprises  -
the little ones - on board. For example, the computerisation of  Cipro  aims
to decrease the costs of SMEs, and there will  be  no  extra  cost  for  the
registration of prospectuses.  The  maximum  fee  in  terms  of  the  Public
Finance Management Act that will be charged is R500.

In the case of huge companies like Old Mutual, attorneys can  charge  up  to
R2,5 million for an 800-page application. This  Bill  will  help  that  now.
This change in fees is an indication that Cipro  is  nonprofit-oriented  and
aims to get small and medium enterprises on board.

A further development  in  this  regard  is  the  introduction  of  the  new
electronic system that will ensure duplication  of  business  registrations.
One does not need to get revenue stamps any more and stand in long queues  -
one can do an electronic transfer.
What is important in this Bill is the amendment in terms of the  removal  of
the R100 penalty or imprisonment in terms of the deregistration clauses  for
those entities that refuse to abide by the law. We  welcome  the  fact  that
the department has accepted our amendment of this. This does not imply  that
all businesses that are not active will be deregistered.  The  intention  of
this clause is to serve as a check as to whether COs and CCs are  active  or
would be active in the near future. This principle applies  to  dormant  COs
and CCs with no assets.

In conclusion, I would like to  say  to  the  hon  Danny  Olifant  that  the
amendmends to this Bill bear no financial implications for  the  state,  and
that Cipro will be financially independent within the next two years.

I now also have an opportunity to wish my daughter Sabrina, who  happens  to
be listening, happy birthday. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, you  are  most  welcome  to  come  back  and
finish using your full speaking time. The best protection  today  on  Friday
the 13th is to be in Parliament.[Laughter].

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Thank you, hon Speaker. To continue  with  my  speech  ...
[Laughter.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, the hon Connie September dealt so  extensively
with the Bill before us that there is not much left for me  to  say  on  it.
She was even so convincing on certain of the items on  which  I  could  have
taken her on that she also convinced me. I think the next time she  goes  to
Belfast or Ulster she should take some of these items with her  and  try  to
see if she cannot convince those two  groupings  fighting  there  with  each
other to continue with that.

Cipro  is  the  combination  of  the  Companies   and   Close   Corporations
Registration Offices with the Patents and Trade Marks Registration  Offices.
Approval has been granted for Cipro under the Public Finance Management  Act
on condition that Cipro cover its operational  costs  within  the  next  two
years from funds generated for services rendered by it.

In the past one had to complete a form, and on the form one  had  to  put  a
revenue stamp. Of course, this was not practical in terms  of  the  recovery
of expenses by means of a claim then against National Treasury. This  was  a
long  drawn-out  process.  With  the  availability  of  e-commerce   it   is
absolutely essential  that  one  move  into  a  new  type  of  business-like
organisation.

One aspect I could perhaps also comment on is that there will now be  annual
returns and comments from both close corporations and  companies  and  other
entities. A question that might be asked is whether we do not  create  extra
red tape in terms of this, and  whether  one  should  not  perhaps  consider
another way out in that if there is any  change  in  the  composition  of  a
company - by shareholding or whatever - that the office  should  be  advised
of such change within six months. This is so that one does not  need  to  go
through all these forms when there has been absolutely no  change  and  when
one looks into this just for the sake of formality.

However, bearing in mind the time factor and the old imperial  saying,  when
we were still dealing with imperial measurements, that ``He  who  thinks  by
the inch and talks by the yard should  be  kicked  by  the  foot'',  I  will
therefore conclude by saying that  the  IFP  will  support  this  particular
Bill.

Dr R T RHODA: Madam Speaker, I too will be brief. The Minister  has  already
encapsulated everything in a nutshell. Basically the  Bill  deals  with  the
fact that the Companies and Close Corporations Registration Offices and  the
Patents and Trade Marks Registration Offices are  going  to  be  amalgamated
into one trading entity, namely the Cipro office.

The main amendment, of course, allows the  Cipro  office  to  be  a  trading
entity. Old methods of payments will be done away with. One will  no  longer
deal with revenue stamps. The normal method  of  generally  accepted  common
forms of payment will be introduced.

There is also the worldwide problem with registration offices'  data  banks.
I am sure they all have millions of companies. We do not know which of  them
are dead, alive, dormant and so on, and what they are  doing.  So  the  only
way to overcome this problem is also  then  to  ask  them  to  lodge  annual
returns and to indicate any changes in their names,  addresses  and  so  on.
This  has  become  a  worldwide  trend  for  better  visibility,  integrity,
compliance and disclosure.

Once this system is up  and  running,  the  legal  systems  such  as  banks,
creditors and investors  will  always  be  able  to  access  things  on  the
Internet. Needless to say, this will help to overcome a lot of fraud in  the
country. With that, I shall end.

The New NP supports the Bill wholeheartedly.

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker and hon members, the Corporate Laws  Amendment
Bill addresses the operations of the  Companies  and  Intellectual  Property
Registration Office. The hon Minister and other  members  of  the  committee
have effectively dealt with the objectives of the Bill.

The Department of Trade and Industry embarked on an ambitious  restructuring
process to bring its operations into line  with  sound  business  principles
and  to  reduce  unnecessary  delays  and  bureaucratic   procedures.   This
amendment is consistent with this  approach  and  process  and  will  enable
Cipro to manage its  processes  and  financial  transactions  timeously  and
effectively. The department needs to comply to meet the condition placed  on
it by the National Treasury to cover its operational costs within  the  next
two years from funds generated for services rendered by it.

The frequent visits by the portfolio committee to the  department  leave  me
with little doubt that the necessary systems are in place  to  achieve  this
and, if the need arises, suitable adjustments can be made.

The introduction of an annual return does not only bring Cipro's  operations
into line with world trends but will enhance investor  confidence.  The  UDM
supports the Bill.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker,  I  thank  colleagues  of
all parties who have supported the Bill. I  think  this  confirms  our  view
that it does usher in an exciting new era.

I believe that anyone dealing with Cipro will have seen that there has  been
a real improvement in efficiency. Once again, I  would  urge  colleagues  to
remember the magic number 0861 84 33 84.

The hon member Sono will find that we have moved a lot of our  Cipro  people
into the call centre. We have increased the number of  people  dealing  with
Cipro issues and, as  she  would  probably  know  from  her  visits  to  the
department, well over 60% of the calls are, in  fact,  Cipro-related  calls.
So, I think, we are seeing some real improvements in performance.

I would like to take this  opportunity  to  thank  Adv  Malunga  -  I  think
reference was made to Adv Simelane, but it is actually  Adv  Malunga  -  and
Rob Angel, the chair of the new board, for the work they  have  done.  I  am
particularly pleased about an aspect not often seen  that  has  happened  at
Cipro in that Adv Malunga has done wonders with raising the morale  of  many
of the women who were working in that office and had been working there  for
many years. He has motivated them and converted them from clerical  workers,
dealing with paper, into computer-literate workers. I think anyone  visiting
Cipro will see  that  this  has  been  one  of  the  great  achievements  in
transforming a department, and we are very proud of that.

I agree that maybe we were a bit harsh  in  suggesting  jail  sentences  for
those companies that did not put in their returns, although  the  temptation
remains for me to keep that aspect, but members have wisely said that it  be
taken out. I think that the data base that we can  get  from  the  companies
offices is absolutely critical and can help us in many ways. We must not  be
slack about this. We are going to be quite tough  on  the  requirement  that
companies comply with their returns. As members know, it  will  not  be  the
case that we will make a great deal of extra work for  them.  We  will  send
them the forms and they must make alterations. So,  by  moving  this  to  an
electronic process, I think we are making real progress.

As my own personal gift to the House  on  this  Friday  I  have  decided  to
reduce my speaking time by two minutes. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on the Interception and  Monitoring  Bill  [B  50  -  2001]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 13 September 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the subject of the  Interception  and  Monitoring
         Bill [B 50 - 2001] (National Assembly - sec  75),  referred  to  it
         and classified by the Joint  Tagging  Mechanism  as  a  section  75
         Bill, presents the Regulation  of  Interception  of  Communications
         and Provision of Communication-related Information Bill  [B  50B  -
         2001]  (National   Assembly   -   sec   75),   and   endorses   the
         classification of the Bill as a section 75 Bill.


         The Committee wishes to report further, as follows:
         1. Clause 9 of the Bill provides  that  any  communication  may  be
              intercepted in any prison if such interception takes place  in
              the exercise of any  power  conferred  by  or  under,  and  in
              accordance with, any regulations made under  the  Correctional
              Services Act, 1998 (Act No. 111 of 1998). Provision is further
              made that any such regulations must,  before  the  publication
              thereof in  the  Gazette,  be  submitted  to  Parliament.  The
              purpose of requiring  such  regulations  to  be  submitted  to
              Parliament  is  to  enable  the  Committee  to  consider   the
              constitutionality of  those  regulations  which  regulate  the
              interception of communications in prisons.


              The Committee has noted  that  the  Minister  of  Correctional
              Services must, in terms of section 134(5) of the  Correctional
              Services Act, 1998, refer proposed regulations which are to be
              made under that Act to the relevant  Parliamentary  Committees
              in both Houses dealing with  the  Department  of  Correctional
              Services. However, as the Portfolio Committee on  Justice  and
              Constitutional Development is not one of  those  Parliamentary
              Committees, such proposed regulations will not in the ordinary
              course of Parliament's business be referred to, or brought  to
              the attention of, the  Committee.  The  possibility  therefore
              exists that the Committee will not always be in a position  to
              consider the constitutionality of such proposed regulations.


              The  Committee  therefore  recommends  that  the  Minister  of
              Correctional  Services  be  requested  to  ensure  that   when
              regulations are referred to the Parliamentary Committees which
              deal with his Department, those regulations  relating  to  the
              interception   of   communications   in   prisons   are   also
              specifically referred to the Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice
              and Constitutional Development for consideration.


         2. Having noted the provisions of  the  National  Key  Points  Act,
              1980 (Act No. 102 of 1980),  the  Committee  wishes  to  bring
              those provisions to the attention of the Minister  of  Defence
              and the Minister of  Intelligence.  The  Committee  recommends
              that  those  Ministers   consider   declaring   the   proposed
              interception centres, to be established by clause 32(1) of the
              Bill, National Key Points in terms  of  section  2(1)  of  the
              National Key Points Act, 1980.


     Report to be considered.
