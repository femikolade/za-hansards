ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I trust some of you have  noticed  we  have
some visitors in our public gallery of whom we are very proud.  We  wish  to
acknowledge Bafana Bafana, a winning team,  because  they  did  win  on  our
behalf. [Applause.]

We are very glad they have joined us today, and they have promised  me,  and
I assure you that it is a very sincere promise, that in  four  years'  time,
they are coming back with the cup. [Applause.]

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Resumption of debate on Vote No 1 - The Presidency:

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA: Madam Speaker,  Madam  Deputy
Speaker, hon Deputy President,  hon  Ministers  and  Deputy  Ministers,  hon
members and fellow South Africans, firstly, I would like to say  a  word  of
appreciation to our national soccer team for being with us today.  We  thank
them for the good, quality football they  displayed  in  Korea.  [Applause.]
They have made us proud. One mark they have left on the  world  of  football
is that our national  team  is  world  class.  We  were  unfortunate  to  be
eliminated on goal difference, but I am confident that next time we will  go
to higher levels.

To Jomo Sono and the entire technical team, and to Lucas Radebe and all  the
players, we say: Heita, Bafana, heita!
HON MEMBERS: Heita! [Hello.] [Applause.]

The PRESIDENT OF  THE  REPUBLIC:  All  of  us  are  very  pleased  that  our
continent remains in contention to win the Soccer World Cup, thanks  to  the
excellent performance of the youth of  Senegal.  [Applause.]  The  prospects
are good that Senegal will advance further towards the achievement  of  this
objective when they face Turkey in the quarterfinals;  Turkey,  whom  Bafana
Bafana defeated. [Applause.] Accordingly, all of Africa wishes them  success
as they engage in that battle. In many ways, the honourable manner in  which
Bafana Bafana acquitted themselves in Korea and  the  progress  achieved  by
Senegal indicate Africa's determination to move  out  of  the  periphery  of
global affairs to which centuries of adverse  developments  have  sought  to
confine her.

As an African country, we must be proud that we  are  part  of  a  continent
that has set itself such a goal. As  the  present  generation,  we  must  be
excited that we are part of a mass movement for the creation, not only of  a
new Africa, but also of a new system of international  relations  that  will
no longer allow that some view us as a strange occurrence on the human  map,
the object of pity or contempt.

The hon Pieter Mulder spoke for all of us when he said that  the  challenges
of Africa are also important to  him;  when  he  said  that  to  meet  these
challenges, we complete a lifetime in South Africa with the  same  spiritual
batteries that an Australian friend has to recharge after  spending  a  year
helping us to solve our problems. The hon Pieter Mulder was  right  when  he
said he grieved for every person who emigrates, because  it  is  a  loss  to
South Africa. But, as he said, people who  decide  to  stay  and  then  only
complain, moan and groan, do not help at all. If one decides  to  stay,  one
should become involved. Only to ask other people, ``What are  you  doing  to
improve my position?'' is not good enough. One should do something  oneself.
What the hon Pieter Mulder was saying was: Vukuzenzele, Afrika! [Applause.]

The hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk was correct when he  said  that  all  of  us
face a choice between isolation and  participation;  between  talking  South
Africa down and believing in South Africa. It  is  a  choice  between  being
partially South African  and  proudly  South  African.  Of  course,  he  was
speaking of the Afrikaans community, but I dare say these choices  face  all
of us as South Africans.

Furthermore, in the context of the new and exciting African  world  of  hope
represented by the African  Union  and  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development, we are confronted  with  the  choice  between  being  partially
African and proudly African. We must support the hon Pieter Mulder  when  he
says:


  My heart is attached to Africa but my mind sets the conditions. I want to
  be myself in Africa. Is that too much to ask?

To get to the point that the hon Pieter Mulder correctly  demands,  we  must
respond to the call made by the hon Gert Oosthuizen when he said:
  The time has come for many of our countrymen and women to make a  choice.
  The choices that they will have to make will be either to  break  out  of
  their isolation or stay in the fight-back kraal; and either to  get  onto
  the playing field to join us in lending a hand and  to  create  a  better
  life for all, or to become the martyr of their self-inflicted paranoia.

[Applause.] As the hon Gert Oosthuizen said: ``Die Jerigomure  is  'n  valse
sekuriteit.'' [The walls of Jericho are a false security.]

In this regard, nobody, anywhere in our country, whoever  they  are,  has  a
right to call for the killing of any South  African,  whatever  the  colour,
race, ethnic origin, gender or health  condition  of  the  intended  victim.
Nobody, whoever they are, has the right to call for the killing  of  farmers
or Boers, or the right to threaten  violence  to  advance  their  particular
goals. [Applause.] Those farmers and Boers are as  much  South  African  and
African as I am, entitled  to  the  same  rights  and  privileges  that  are
enjoyed by any other South African. They  too  are  needed  on  the  playing
field of which the hon Gert Oosthuizen spoke, lending a  hand  to  create  a
better life for all. I am proud that indeed many  of  them  have  come  onto
this playing field,  not  being  partially  African,  but  proudly  African.
[Applause.]

The hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk said:


  It has become commonplace for South Africa and South Africans to  astound
  the world. Where other people lose hope, we see  opportunity.  The  whole
  world thought that the only logical outcome  of  our  history  of  racial
  conflict would be a bloody revolution. But we snatched victory  from  the
  jaws of defeat ...

I would like to  take  this  opportunity  to  wish  the  hon  Marthinus  van
Schalkwyk well in his new and challenging  responsibilities  as  Premier  of
the Western Cape. [Applause.] Surely, we should all wish him success  as  he
works according to the correct observations he made:


  By moving forward into the future and by making a huge  effort  together,
  we can improve our common destiny. Together South Africa wins.

The message coming out of the whole of our continent is that the peoples  of
Africa have taken the decision that it must become  commonplace  for  Africa
and the Africans to astound the world, as the quality  of  African  football
has astounded the world. Where some, including  people  within  this  House,
continue to see ours as a hopeless continent,  the  peoples  of  Africa  are
determined to draw inspiration from their adversity to  create  a  continent
of opportunity. Where some pray that we should fail  because  something  has
gone wrong in one  African  country,  those  who  are  proudly  African  are
resolved  to  fight  for  the  renaissance  of  our  continent  despite  any
setbacks, while they act together to correct whatever might be wrong.

Even others, far away from our shores, who are not African  have  joined  us
in this  struggle,  understanding  their  obligations  to  the  millions  of
ordinary people on  our  continent  who  are  struggling  for  freedom  from
poverty, freedom from underdevelopment, freedom from oppression  and  denial
of human rights, freedom from the denial of their cultural,  linguistic  and
religious rights.

As  we  meet  here,  10  000  British  citizens,  drawn   from   the   major
nongovernmental organisations in that country, are  lobbying  their  members
of parliament, demanding that their government should take positions at  the
forthcoming G8 summit  in  Canada  that  will  help  create  the  conditions
globally,  especially  with  regard  to   international   trade,   for   the
realisation of the objectives of Nepad. [Applause.]

Because of this G8 meeting, they say that June 2002 is a pivotal moment  for
the world's poor and therefore for all of us. It is good to have  such  true
friends, whose preoccupation about Africa is not driven by narrow  political
agendas, but by a commitment to help restore the dignity of the  peoples  of
Africa. I am pleased that I had the opportunity this afternoon to  speak  to
one of these friends, Tony Dykes of Christian Aid and the World  Development
Movement, to convey our sincere appreciation for their selfless support  for
the poor in the world, including the African poor.

 We too are walking along this path of African renewal and  the  restoration
of the dignity of all our people. That we will achieve our goals, I have  no
doubt. That our mother continent, Africa, will achieve its goals, I have  no
doubt. As we did in this country when we engaged  in  negotiations  to  move
out of our miserable past and we determined that we had the duty to  resolve
our own problems, depending on our own resources  and  native  talents,  the
peoples of Africa have resolved that they must act  together,  depending  on
their own resources and native talents, to end the age of  misery  that  has
enveloped Africa for hundreds of years. This is what the  African  Union  is
about. That is what Nepad represents.

As we did not fail when we took the decision to take our  destiny  into  our
own hands, I am certain that our continent will not fail, precisely  because
it has decided  to  determine  its  own  future  without  depending  on  the
benevolence of others. It is out of this kind of engagement with the act  of
creation that new worlds are born, as a new  world  is  being  born  in  our
country in front of our very eyes, as a new African world is being  born  in
front of our very eyes, with us  present  and  active  in  that  process  of
creation.

In this context, I would like to thank our Deputy President,  our  Ministers
and Deputy Ministers, leaders of various parties and organisations of  civil
society, directors-general and other senior officials, for the work the  are
doing to lead us in the process of the rebirth of South Africa  and  Africa.
To achieve this noble goal they are obliged to travel the world  to  explain
what we are about, to build a global movement of friends of Africa, to  help
create the global conditions for the success of our  efforts  as  a  country
and a continent. We will do everything  we  have  to  do  to  achieve  these
objectives, including talking to leaders and citizens of  all  countries  in
the world.

We did this in the past to liberate our country from the yoke of  apartheid.
We will do it  again,  to  liberate  our  country  and  continent  from  the
dehumanising shackles of poverty and underdevelopment  in  our  country  and
the rest of Africa. [Applause.]

Even at times of great social change, there are some who are  passed  by  by
those processes of transformation because  they  can  see  no  further  than
their noses. Yet others sleep through these moments like  Rip  van  Winkels,
and wake up to demand the restoration of the old order they knew  when  they
fell into deep slumber. [Laughter.]

I am afraid that there are some in this country and in this  House  who  are
victim to such misfortunes. The train of progress will pass them by. It  may
be that they may not even be able to catch  the  last  coach.  Nevertheless,
the train will not stop.

As we move on towards a brighter future for our country and  our  continent,
we will also  define  ourselves  afresh,  both  as  South  Africans  and  as
Africans, celebrating our identity as peoples of Africa who  are  dignified,
who have their own personality, who value and respect their diversity,  who,
like the hon Pieter Mulder, want to be themselves in Africa,  who  excel  in
creative thought and the creative arts, who are peaceful, who value  liberty
and respect the rights of the women, children, the elderly and  people  with
disabilities and the  strangers  in  their  midst,  who  are  determined  to
liberate  themselves  from  the  destructive  humiliation  of  poverty   and
underdevelopment.

Shortly, we will be receiving the representatives of the peoples of  Africa.
We will create a new organisation of these  masses,  the  African  Union.  A
little later, we will welcome the peoples of the world who will  convene  at
the  World  Summit  for  Sustainable  Development  to  tackle  the  enormous
challenges of which the hon Pallo Jordan spoke  yesterday.  The  message  we
must convey to all these leaders and representatives is the message that  as
South Africans and Africans, we have committed ourselves to the vision of  a
South Africa and an Africa reborn. We must  make  the  undertaking  to  them
that we will do everything necessary to end the long, dark night of  inhuman
suffering in our country and continent.

 We must ask them to  join  us  in  our  exciting  journey  as  friends  who
understand the meaning of human solidarity.  We  must  recite  to  them  the
words of the Afrikaner, H A Fagan, which inspire the whole  of  Africa,  and
which the hon Gert Oosthuizen read to us yesterday.


  Uit duisende monde word die lied gedra,
  Ek sluit my oë soos 'n serafskoor.
  Val daar stemme, strelend op my oë:
  Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika.

[Applause.]

Question agreed to in terms of section 74(3)(a) of the Constitution.

Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Bill [B 17D  -
2002] (National Assembly - sec 74) accordingly agreed to.

   LOSS OR RETENTION OF MEMBERSHIP OF NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES
                                    BILL

 (Consideration of Bill, as amended by National Council of Provinces, and of
   Report of Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development
                                  thereon)

There was no debate.

Question put: That the Loss or  Retention  of  Membership  of  National  And
Provincial Legislatures Bill [B 25B - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 76)  be
agreed to.

During division:

The SPEAKER: Those in favour of the Bill being agreed to  should  now  press
the blue button and those against, the red button. [Interjections.]  Please,
hon members, would you leave your cards in the slots for  the  moment  until
the results are announced.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, on a point or order: Are you  going  to
allow us to vote no also? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER:  I  said,  ``Those  who  are  against,  please  press  the  red
button.'' [Interjections.] Hon Mr Van der Merwe, you were so busy  counting,
you did not hear me. [Laughter.]

Hon members, the ayes voted  285,  the  noes  voted  30  and  there  are  13
abstentions. [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, I think there  is  a  misunderstanding.
We did not hear you clearly saying, ``Those against must now press  the  red
button.''  This  is  why  you  have  the  13   abstentions,   I   am   sure.
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: I assume you are calling for a revote, because we  do  have  to
record votes. [Interjections.]

Mr J  H  VAN  DER  MERWE:  We  will  only  have  to  revote  the  no  votes.
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: No, I am afraid that is not really permissible.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: As you please, your lordship - oh ... [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, Please remove your cards from the slot.  We
will take the vote again, because this is a constitutional Bill and I  would
like it to be absolutely clear.

Question agreed to.

Loss or Retention of Membership  of  National  And  Provincial  Legislatures
Bill [B 25B - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 76) accordingly agreed to.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms N D NGCENGWANE: Chair, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Thabo Mbeki appealed for unity and  urged  South
       Africans to be more positive about their country  during  the  Budget
       Vote debate on the Presidency on Tuesday, 18 June 2002;


  (2) believes that the unity of our people, irrespective of  race,  tribe,
       colour or religion, is an  important  precondition  to  building  the
       nonracial, nonsexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa we  seek
       to build; and


  (3) echoes the call made by the President for our people to unite for the
       reconstruction and development of our country.

[Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Libyan ruler, President Muammar Gaddafi,  states  that
       Nepad is a project of former colonisers and racists;


  (2) records that President  Gaddafi's  scepticism  about  Nepad  probably
       relates to  its  insistence  on  democracy,  human  rights  and  good
       governance - concepts which are foreign to Libya under Gaddafi; and


  (3) urges President Mbeki to put Africa ahead of the ANC's fundraising by
       ignoring President  Gaddafi  and  other  African  dictators,  and  to
       continue insisting that democracy and good governance remain part  of
       the New Partnership for Africa's Development.

[Interjections.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day  of  the
House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) is appalled to learn that the abuse of heroin is rife among teenagers
       in South Africa;


  (2) deplores the fact that  this  abuse  of  heroin  is  quickly  gaining
       momentum among black teenagers, depicting a new  trend  on  substance
       abuse;


  (3) sympathises with the drug crisis centres across the country  who  are
       struggling to cope with the unprecedented demand  for  rehabilitation
       treatment; and


  (4)  urges  the  Departments  of  Safety  and  Security  and  of   Social
       Development to do  everything  in  their  power  to  deal  with  this
       scourge.

Ms J MOLOI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf
of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the  Minister  of  Health,  the  hon  Manto  Tshabalala-Msimang,
           announced the launch of the Khomanani Health  Worker  Excellence
           Award for HIV and Aids, tuberculosis  and  sexually  transmitted
           infections campaign; and


       (b)  this campaign aims at motivating and encouraging health  workers
           to change attitudes and enabling  them  to  act  responsibly  in
           dealing  with  those  infected  and  affected  by  the  HIV/Aids
           epidemic;


  (2) believes that health workers -


       (a)  are vital players in the prevention of HIV and Aids; and


       (b)  play  a  significant  role  in  fighting  stigma  and  promoting
           openness to people living with HIV/Aids; and


  (3) welcomes the launch of the Khomanani Health Workers Excellence Award,
       as this will contribute to encouraging health workers to work towards
       a better life for all our people through providing  health  care  for
       all.

[Applause.]

Mr J SCHIPPERS: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the positive outcome of constructive talks held between  a  New
       NP delegation  and  Mr  Lekota,  Minister  of  Defence  and  national
       chairperson of the ANC,  and  Mr  Nqakula,  Minister  of  Safety  and
       Security;


  (2) also notes that as a result of these talks the ANC has -


       (a)  distanced itself from the  slogan  ``Kill  the  boer,  kill  the
           farmer'' that was chanted at the funeral of the  late  Mr  Peter
           Mokaba, ANC MP;


       (b)  condemned the shocking farm murders over the weekend in KwaZulu-
           Natal; and


       (c)  agreed once again that  reconciliation  is  the  most  important
           factor in eliminating prejudice between communities;


  (3) commends the Ministers for their swift action and for agreeing to the
       meeting at such short notice; and


  (4) believes this bodes well for  the  future  co-operation  between  our
       parties and communities.

[Applause.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Hon Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I will  move
on behalf of the UDM at the next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the explosive video footage detailing corruption, drug and arms
       smuggling and sexual abuse of juveniles in prisons shown to  millions
       of South Africans last night;
  (2) acknowledges this as proof of  a  complete  breakdown  of  the  basic
       operational functioning of the prison system;


  (3) calls for the immediate suspension of wardens identified in the video
       pending the outcome of further investigations;


  (4) urges the Minister and the Commissioner of Correctional  Services  to
       put aside their personal embarrassment  regarding  these  revelations
       and to act decisively and urgently to  rid  the  department  of  such
       corrupt officials and practices  that  endanger  the  lives  of  both
       officials and inmates; and


  (5) calls on  the  Minister  and  on  the  Commissioner  of  Correctional
       Services to keep this House  and  the  public  informed  about  steps
       taken.

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move on behalf  of
the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the people of Keiskammahoek in the Eastern Cape received a
       R102 million land claim settlement this weekend;


  (2) recalls that the people  of  Gwili-Gwili,  Gxulu,  Mnyameni,  Mtwaku,
       Ndlovini, Ngobazana and Upper Ngqumeya were forcibly  removed  during
       the implementation of the  so-called  betterment  planning  from  the
       1950s;


  (3) notes that the award will be divided into R47,3 million for financial
       compensation and R54,9 million for development projects;


  (4) congratulates the people of Keiskammahoek on the settlement of  their
       claim; and


  (5) commends the Land Claims Commission, the Border Rural Committee,  the
       Department of Land Affairs, the National Development Agency  and  the
       Land Bank for the roles they played in the settlement of this claim.

[Applause.]
Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move  on
behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern that South Africa is currently importing maize from
           overseas, particularly Mexico and Canada, and the fear that  our
           farmers might not be in a position to meet our domestic demands;


       (b)  that this  has  the  real  potential  to  lead  to  maize  being
           completely depleted thus presenting a situation which we can ill
           afford; and


       (c)  that the country is currently experiencing rising costs in terms
           of basic foodstuffs; and


  (2) urges the Government to pay special attention to this anomaly.
Dr S E M PHEKO: Chair, I give notice that I shall, at the  next  sitting  of
the House, move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the PAC supports the filing of  the  legal  claim  by  the
       victims of apartheid for reparations from  Swiss,  American  and  all
       other banks which propped up the  apartheid  regime  in  our  country
       during the colonial and apartheid era;


  (2) considers the apartheid reparations international claim  a  milestone
       in the history of the struggle for the people of this country and  of
       Africa in general;


  (3) views this claim as a turning point  in  the  pursuit  of  truth  and
       justice for the brutalised and powerless people of this world; and


  (4) notes that -


       (a)  the PAC salutes Jubilee 2000 for the noble struggle it has  been
           waging for reparations at the time when the  PAC  was  ridiculed
           for raising this issue by those  who  ignore  the  principle  of
           international law when claimed by Africa's people; and


       (b)  the PAC further wishes the legal teams  which  are  representing
           the victims of apartheid all success.

Mr S M RASMENI: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the report that a Durban film script writer,  Ramesh  Jethalal,
       poured fuel onto  the  explosive  debate  raging  on  about  Mbongeni
       Ngema's controversial song AmaNdiya, by accusing  Africans  of  being
       carriers of HIV/Aids, criminals and of being uneducated;


  (2) believes that -
       (a)  racism, racial stereotypes and racial prejudice do  not  have  a
           place in the new democratic dispensation, and must be  condemned
           wherever they rear their ugly heads; and


       (b)  both Mbongeni Ngema's song and Ramesh Jethalal's statement  only
           serve to fuel racial hatred  and  racial  division  amongst  our
           people and are an impediment to building a new nation; and


  (3) rejects the racist understones of Mbongeni Ngema's  song  and  Ramesh
       Jethalal's statement, which fuel racial tensions and racial divisions
       amongst our people.

[Applause.]

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  'n taal wat op ander afgedwing is juis die  vonk  in  the  1976-
           kruitvat was;


       (b)  die voortdurende ondermyning van Afrikaans en die geestesgoedere
           van Afrikaanssprekendes 'n kenmerk van die Asmal-era geword het;
           en


       (c)  dat die imperialistiese  onderrok  van  die  Europese  professor
           duidelik toon dat  hy  nie  in  staat  is  om  die  kwessie  van
           taalregte objektief te benader nie; en


  (2) 'n  dringende  taal-Kodesa  aanvra  waar  die  volle  implikasie  van
       taalregte eens en vir altyd uitgespel sal word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note of the fact that -


       (a)  a language which was forced on others was the very spark in  the
           1976 tinder-box;


       (b)  the continued undermining of Afrikaans and the spiritual  assets
           of Afrikaans speakers has become a characteristic of  the  Asmal
           era; and


       (c)  the imperialistic petticoat of the  European  professor  clearly
           shows that he is not able to  approach  the  issue  of  language
           rights objectively; and


  (2) urgently requests a language Codesa where the  full  implications  of
       language rights can be spelled out once and for all.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson, I wish to give notice that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the announcement by the Minister  of  Environmental  Affairs
       and Tourism that he will go on-line in order  that  he  can  open  an
       almost direct line of communication  between  himself  and  concerned
       citizens of our land, especially at this time of preparation for  the
       world summit;


  (2) notes that the tremendous negative impact that the burning of  fossil
       fuels and other practices have on the environment  leads  to  serious
       anxiety on the part of individuals; and


  (3) welcomes the opportunity for all concerned citizens to speak directly
       to the Minister and to be answered on a one-on-one basis allowing for
       all shades of opinions to be fully ventilated and taken into account.

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Chairperson, with appropriateness observed, I hereby  give
notice that I shall move:
  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with alarm the video footage detailing drugs and arms  smuggling
           and  the  sex  abuse   of   juveniles   in   Grootvlei   Prison,
           Bloemfontein; and


       (b)  that the manifestation of corruption where prisoners are  easily
           able to buy marijuana, mandrax, alcohol and  juvenile  prisoners
           for sex from warders  underlies  the  disturbing  state  of  our
           overcrowded prisons with -


           (i)   staffing shortages;


           (ii)  low staff morale related to low pay; and


           (iii)  corrupt  warders  who  secure  employment  by  falsifying
                  documents;


  (2) urges all staff of the Department of Correctional  Services  to  give
       committed and unwavering  support  to  the  Jali  commission  in  its
       investigations;


  (3) commends those who have thus far exposed corruption in  our  prisons;
       and


  (4) calls for the immediate dismissal of those found to  be  culpable  of
       any corruption.

[Applause.]

Mr A BLAAS: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move on behalf  of  the
New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) gives recognition to the Waterwise Madadeni oSizweni Project  (WMOP),
       managed by  the  Municipal  Council  of  Newcastle,  which  has  been
       selected out of hundreds of development projects to  represent  South
       Africa at the  Dubai  International  Awards  for  Best  Practices  to
       Improve the Living Environment 2002;


  (2) notes that the project -


       (a)  supplies water to approximately 150 000 people;


       (b)  prevents pollution of the Ncandu  River  and  has  improved  the
           quality of life for the residents;


       (c)   improved  communication  between  the  residents  of  Madadeni,
           oSizweni, the local council and the municipality;


       (d)  is made sustainable through the commitment and participation  of
           the community; and


       (e)  creates jobs focused on the youth, women  and  disabled  people;
           and


  (3) believes that this project does South Africa  proud  and  wishes  the
       Municipal  Council  of  Newcastle  the  best  of   luck   with   this
       participation.

[Applause.]

              FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND INTERMEDIARY SERVICES BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and hon members, the  protection
of consumers of all varieties of financial  services  and  products  is  the
reason I stand before you today. In South Africa there has  been  no  formal
system of regulating financial advisers  and  intermediaries.  This  implies
that there has been no recourse for consumers who have been  sold  financial
products that are either ill-suited to their needs or  do  not  deliver  the
promised returns.

There has  been  a  long-felt  need  for  regulation  that  stems  from  the
commission of inquiry into the affairs of the Masterbond group and  investor
protection in South Africa in October 2001.

The Policy Board for Financial Services and Regulation in 1996 accepted  the
task of conceptualising and designing appropriate legislation to cover  this
regulatory  deficiency.  In  December  1998,  after  several  meetings   and
workshops, the policy board produced a basic framework for this law.

The Financial Services Board  was  mandated  to  draft  legislation  and  to
conduct   the   necessary   consultation   process.   Following    extensive
consultations, the range of financial products that were to  be  defined  in
the Bill was expanded significantly so as to cover most  financial  products
and instruments, including bank deposits.

A major revision of  the  ambit  of  the  Bill  occurred  when  intermediary
services were made subject to the terms of the  Bill,  in  addition  to  the
furnishing of advice, thereby bringing into  the  regulatory  net  virtually
all the activities of the entire broker fraternity in the long-term and  the
short-term insurance industries, as well  as  those  of  portfolio  or  fund
managers.

What is important to understand is that the Bill has a functional,  and  not
institutional, approach. It  regulates  a  function,  not  a  person  or  an
institution directly. Therefore,  if  a  person  performs  the  function  of
``advice'' or  ``intermediary  services'',  that  person  will  have  to  be
licensed under the Bill, irrespective of whether the  person  is  a  product
supplier  who  may  already  be  licensed  under  some  other  law,  or   an
intermediary or broker, or an  investment  manager.  In  each  instance  the
``advice'' or the ``intermediary service''  must  relate  to  a  ``financial
product'' which embraces almost every investment  or  insurance  product  or
financial instrument in the marketplace.

Effective regulation is to be  achieved  through  a  number  of  mechanisms.
Firstly, a financial services provider must be  licensed  in  terms  of  the
Bill and will  have  to  comply  with  certain  prescribed  fit  and  proper
criteria relating to  honesty  and  integrity,  competence  and  operational
ability, and financial soundness.  A  licence  may  be  granted  subject  to
certain conditions and restrictions, which creates the opportunity  for  the
differentiation or categorisation of providers in accordance with  the  type
and level of service rendered. In that way, unreasonable entry barriers  may
be obviated.

Secondly, the Bill imposes responsibilities on financial  service  providers
with regard  to  their  representatives  for  whose  conduct  the  financial
services  provider  is  liable.  A  representative  engages  in   the   same
activities as its principal, but does so for or on behalf of  the  financial
services provider, because he or she is either  an  employee  or  holds  the
mandate from the provider. Representatives also need to  meet  the  criteria
relating to honesty and competence.

In order to establish a professional group of financial  services  providers
in South Africa, the Bill lays down standards  for  the  market  conduct  of
both providers and representatives. The focus is the needs of the  consumer,
the rights of the consumer to be treated  fairly,  full  disclosure  of  any
relevant matter and the  responsibility  of  the  industry  players  to  act
professionally and to place the interests of the consumer above their own.

A system of compliance is created in order to monitor adherence to the  law,
through the  appointment  of  compliance  officers,  record-keeping,  proper
accounting and, where appropriate, auditing requirements.

Due care has been taken to ensure effective law enforcement in the event  of
transgressions by financial service providers or  representatives.  Consumer
complaints will be dealt with through a formal, yet  expeditious  and  cost-
effective, dispute resolution mechanism in the form of  the  Office  of  the
Ombud for Financial Service Providers. The design of the office is  to  meet
the  constitutional  requirements  of  independence  and   impartiality.   A
determination by the ombud will have the effect  of  a  civil  judgment  and
will be executable through the ordinary judicial process.

In addition, civil remedies are available to the registrar,  such  as  class
actions on behalf of deprived clients. The registrar, who  is  empowered  to
declare certain practices undesirable, may impose administrative  penalties.
Finally, criminal sanctioning is provided for through heavy fines and  terms
of imprisonment.

Like other Acts administered by  the  Financial  Services  Board,  the  Bill
creates a registrar, being the executive officer  of  the  FSB.  There  will
also be an advisory committee  with  whom  the  registrar  must  consult  on
important issues affecting the implementation of the Bill.

An outstanding feature of the Bill is its flexibility of  application.  This
will enable the regulator to rectify  unintended  consequences,  to  address
cases of hardship and to ensure pragmatism in the application of the Act.

In conclusion, I am happy to state that the controversy  over  the  position
of health brokers  -  that  is,  whether  their  market  conduct  should  be
regulated under this Bill, rather than under the Medical Schemes Act  -  has
been sensibly resolved. The essential element of the agreement concluded  is
that intermediaries in the medical schemes environment  -  in  other  words,
health brokers - will, like all other  intermediaries,  be  subject  to  the
common framework provided by the Bill, thereby  establishing  an  integrated
approach to market conduct regulation.

I must say that we shall await an amendment, which is to be effected to  the
Medical Schemes Act as part of the agreement that we entered into, in  order
to make sure that our definitions of ``health broker'' are the same in  both
the  Medical  Schemes  Act  and  the  Financial  Advisory  and  Intermediary
Services Bill.

The Bill before  the  National  Assembly  today  is  the  final  product  of
intensive deliberations during  the  consultative  process  and  during  the
debates  before  the  portfolio  committee.  All  major  industry   players,
consumer  organisations,  governmental  institutions  and  regulators   have
expressed support for this Bill. It is proposed that a sound case  has  been
made for the adoption of the Bill in the interests of  consumer  protection.
[Applause.]

Ms B A HOGAN: Chairperson, the Deputy Minister has  given  us  an  excellent
summary of the main provisions of this Bill, so I will not  repeat  what  he
has said. Suffice it to say that the protection of  consumers  of  financial
products is vital, given  that  this  has  been  absent  in  our  regulatory
environment for so long.

The regulator, the Financial Services Board, is going to set up a  registrar
of financial services providers, who will  act  as  the  regulator  for  the
people who provide financial services products.

During committee meetings there was some debate as  to  what  constitutes  a
financial product. One of these debates became one of the  most  contentious
debates in the  committee,  and  that  is  whether  a  health  product,  for
instance, can be said to be a financial product or not.

Now it is clear that  for  most  people  provision  for  medical  aid  is  a
financial act. It is also very clear at the same time that the provision  of
medical aid is very much part of a health system,  and  so  it  has  a  dual
reality. Hence the most difficult issue which  the  committee  had  to  deal
with was: How do we deal with people who sell health products?  Should  they
be seen as normal vendors of a financial product or should they be  seen  as
part of a system which renders health services to the country at large?  The
debate centred on  whether  the  Financial  Services  Board  should  be  the
regulator of people who sell health products or whether the Medical  Schemes
Council should be that regulator.

It was pointed out that in  terms  of  the  Medical  Schemes  Act  there  is
virtually no protection for the consumer  -  absolutely  no  protection.  In
fact, there is not even enabling legislation. There  is  no  protection  for
consumers of health products. The only protection  that  could  be  afforded
would therefore be via the protection envisaged in  the  Financial  Services
Board.

With that in mind, an agreement has been reached between the two  regulators
that, in fact, the Financial Services  Board  will  provide  the  regulatory
framework for the protection of people who sell health  products,  but  that
the Medical Schemes Council will continue to licence these people.

I think  this  is  a  very,  very  sensible  arrangement.  It  is  not  dual
supervision, as some have claimed, but does provide, I think,  the  kind  of
ideal solution to the dual nature of the  kind  of  product  that  is  being
sold. What  one  must  point  out  is  that  one  did  not  want  regulatory
arbitrage. In other words, one did not want financial service  providers  or
intermediaries registering as the vendors of health  products  in  order  to
avoid  the  more  punitive  regime  of  the  financial  services  regulatory
environment. Therefore I think we have reached  a  satisfactory  conclusion.
Like the Deputy Minister, we  look  forward  to  the  amendments  which  the
Health Ministry will bring to this House to effect  the  kind  of  agreement
which has been reached.

But there are one or two other issues that I just want to  touch  on,  which
affected our debates within the committee. One was the question  around  the
independence of the ombud. To what extent can we  say  that  this  ombud  is
completely independent? We effected some changes to ensure the  independence
of that ombud and I think we are more satisfied, and have got legal  opinion
on that now, that the ombud has a more independent status.

The other issue was the issue of bank deposits. Should those who  advise  on
bank deposits fall within this regulatory environment? We acknowledged  that
an ordinary bank teller could provide financial advice to  persons  standing
in a queue and say, ``maybe take out this kind of bank deposit, rather  than
that,'' and then that would  place  some  terrible  onerous  regime  on  the
banking industry to then follow the full requirements of protection.

We reached a compromise on that as well. Bank  deposits  will  fall  in  the
range of protections offered by the financial services  regulator,  but  not
with the severity that pertains to other products.

The cost-benefit analysis was also done. There was  an  argument  from  many
sources that this kind of regulation imposes enormous  costs  and  that  the
costs are, inevitably, passed on to the consumer. We had the  benefit  of  a
detailed cost-benefit analysis and, yes, there are some costs.  However,  we
believe that these costs are necessary in order for the  consumer  to  enjoy
the protection. If we look at  what  happened  to  people  involved  in  the
Masterbond debacle, for instance,  far  more  was  lost  to  them  than  the
incidental costs arising.

I have also spoken to people in the industry, and there are people who  have
said to  me  that  they  are  compliance  officers  in  the  life  insurance
industry, and that they are concerned about  the  practices  that  sometimes
pertain in that particular industry. For instance, a compliance officer  can
be called into  the  general  manager's  office  and  instructed,  literally
instructed, to write off on compliance issues even  though  that  compliance
officer knows that the compliance regime is not correct.

So this is not an Act that  is  impervious,  and  we  trust  that  the  Life
Officers' Association and those agencies that are involved will continue  to
review their internal practices so that the objectives of this Bill are  not
defeated through the way in which these mechanisms are implemented.

Finally, there is an advisory committee  that  will  advise  the  regulator.
Mention has been made of the fact that there is a danger that one  can  have
industry capture, that because the advisory  committee  consists  of  people
who are active in the industry and includes them,  that  industry  can  then
capture the regulator. I think this is an issue which we  do  need  to  note
and, maybe, come back to at a certain stage  because  it  has  very  serious
consequences.

Finally, the  Minister  of  Finance  has  called  for  a  single  regulator.
Obviously, the issues that  were  brought  before  our  committee  certainly
reveal the fact that there can be enormous turf battles between  regulators.
Certainly, when one looks at the way that products are now  offered  by  the
same people, we can see that there is no longer the  strict  delineation  of
these institutions. Perhaps the ideal of a  single  regulator  needs  to  be
entertained seriously.

However, I would urge that a public debate ensue around the  question  of  a
single financial regulator so that we can all hear  the  arguments  for  and
against, and there are considerable ones in terms of that. We  look  forward
to such a debate taking place. Certainly, for us in the committee  it  would
make our job much easier. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, some  of  you  are
competing with the speaker at the podium.

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, hon  members,  globally  we  are  witnessing  an
increase in the activities of regulatory structures and  the  regulation  of
industries and bodies that formally prided themselves on the  principles  of
self-regulation. Recently  Arthur  Andersen  and  Merrill  Lynch  have  been
examples sparking further debate on corporate governance and  regulation  in
the interests of shareholders and consumers.

Having emphasised the imperative for  regulation  to  protect  consumers,  I
need to make three  important  provisos.  Firstly,  the  financial  services
sector is a vibrant,  rapidly  diversifying  and  transforming  sector,  and
legislation must not impede and/or stifle the innovation and  transformation
of the sector.

Secondly, the  clear  contractual  axiom  caveat  emptor,  ``let  the  buyer
beware'', remains a guiding principle, which no  amount  of  regulation  can
ever replace.

Thirdly, no level of regulation can protect consumers  from  weak  corporate
governance in any entities and/or in  the  financial  services  industry.  A
balance therefore needs to be struck between sound corporate governance  and
the regulation of the financial services providers in accordance  with  this
Bill.

In the financial services industry, as in any other, there is, of course,  a
balance that needs to be  struck  between  the  protection  awarded  to  the
consumer and  ensuring  that  the  viability  and  vigorous  entrepreneurial
activity within the financial  services  sector  is  not  hamstrung  in  any
manner.

A balance needs to be struck between the responsibilities of  consumers  and
basic regulation that will allow consumers to distinguish between  good  and
bad financial services providers and products.  In  this  regard,  the  role
played by the media and columnists in advising the public on  good  and  bad
providers and products was never mentioned in these discussions.
Do media houses  therefore  have  a  duty  and  an  obligation  to  register
formally as financial advisers or intermediaries?  This  is  an  issue  that
will need resolving.

The legislation before us today and the system  of  accreditation  which  it
creates for financial service providers in terms of clause 8  of  the  Bill,
as well as the consequential amendments to the Medical Schemes Act,  aim  to
create greater  clarity  in  respect  of  good  and  bad  financial  service
providers  and  products.  However,  despite  the  agreements  between   the
executive officer of the FSB and the Registrar of Medical  Schemes  and  the
Banking Council of South Africa in relation to  medical  financial  services
and deposits in the banking sector,  which  have  taken  away  some  of  the
concerns about an unlevel playing field in terms of service providers,  some
concerns remain.

In relation to creating an unlevel playing field, the passage  of  the  FAIS
Bill leaves a number of areas untouched, such as the microlending  industry,
where we clearly need either a tightening of the existing regulations  under
the Micro Finance  Regulatory  Council  in  consultation  with  the  DTI  or
further transformation  to  ensure  that  the  microlending  industry  falls
squarely under the regulations of the FAIS Bill.  Furthermore,  while  there
may be arguments to be made to exempt or phase in the  application  of  this
Bill to the emerging financial advisory sector,  such  steps  will  have  to
contend with the equality provisions of the Constitution.

While it is to be  welcomed  that  an  agreement  was  reached  between  the
Ministries of Health and Finance and the respective regulators,  a  note  of
concern needs to be sounded that a deal between key agents of the  executive
and regulators which is  then  not  submitted  for  public  comment  by  the
industry affected and a second round of public comment on a  crucial  deals,
such as this one, must not recur in future.

Globally, the financial services industry is regulated with a  great  degree
of specificity. While the FAIS Bill takes the first step  in  regulation  in
the interests of consumers, Parliament and  indeed  the  advisory  committee
set up in accordance with this Bill, which comprises industry players -  and
admittedly there is a risk of regulatory capture - must keep a watchful  eye
not only on the regulations issued pursuant to the passage of this Bill  but
also over the implementation going forward.

In this respect it is cause for concern  that  the  Policyholder  Protection
Rules set up in accordance with the Long-term Insurance  Act  will  continue
in force alongside this Bill to be rolled  back  by  ministerial  notice  in
terms of clause 44(5) of the Bill.  Given  that  there  are  inconsistencies
between the underlying principles of the PP rules and the FAIS Bill,  it  is
debatable whether clause 44(5) and this process are  fully  satisfactory  to
address the transition between the two regulatory regimes.

While in terms of principle and in practical terms  the  advisory  committee
should have a great degree of advisory sway over the registrar  in  deciding
how to roll back some of the PP  rules  in  advising  the  Minister,  it  is
regrettable that the current crafting of  clause  44(5)  takes  insufficient
notice of this practical reality.

One of the crucial concerns the DA has in relation  to  this  Bill  has  yet
again highlighted one of the weaknesses  of  this  Parliament:  the  balance
between  enabling  provisions  and  regulations.  Unfortunately,  the  cost-
benefit analysis  submitted  to  the  committee  on  this  Bill  by  Genesis
Analytics, which estimated the compliance cost  to  the  financial  services
industry to be R334 million per annum  versus  a  R1,15  billion  gain,  was
methodologically deeply flawed and did not take  any  additional  compliance
burden emanating from the regulations into account. It can  be  convincingly
argued that the real compliance cost  to  the  financial  services  industry
will only become clear once the regulations, the predictable  devil  in  the
detail of the compliance issue, have been finalised.

Already  the  FSB  have  referred  to  13  pieces  of  potential   secondary
legislation that need to be finalised in accordance with  this  Bill.  Apart
from the difficulty this poses in judging whether the  Bill  really  strikes
an appropriate balance between consumer and industry interests,  the  DA  is
furthermore concerned  that  the  new  increased  compliance  costs  of  the
regulatory burden must not be passed onto consumers in total.

Despite the concerns highlighted above, it is compelling to note  that  this
Bill enjoys the support of most if not all industry players. As long as  the
registrar and the FSB continue to take the views of the  Advisory  Committee
on Financial Services Providers into account - I am not saying it has to  be
conclusive or persuasive, given the risk of  regulatory  capture  -  in  the
development of regulations and the implementation of this  legislation,  the
industry will continue to have a say in the implementation phase of the  new
regulatory regime.

With some of the concerns we have highlighted, the DA  supports  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr  H  J  BEKKER:  Mr  Chairman,  the  hon  Minister  confirmed  that   this
legislation encompasses the widest  categories  and  the  widest  terms  for
financial advisers, brokers or agents.

Inkatha is in favour of many of the regulations, but  the  question  can  be
asked, with regard to few cases: ``Are we not creating a shotgun to  kill  a
fly?'' The Free Market Foundation, inter alia, drew  our  attention  to  the
fact that we have, since the inception of the insurance  industry  in  South
Africa,  never  regulated  insurance  agents.  But  now  that  many  African
insurance agents are emerging, we want almost to overregulate. When  one  is
in agreement, however, with 95% of the Bill, how can one  vote  against  the
few anomalies that are there?

Let me rather now concentrate on the positive  aspects  of  the  Bill.  With
regard to medical schemes,  the  IFP  has  for  many  years  called  for  an
oversight relationship by the  FSB  of  the  financial  aspects  of  medical
schemes. We are therefore satisfied that this facility is  enabled  by  this
legislation.
The  Financial  Advisory  and  Intermediary  Services  Bill  regulates   the
business of rendering financial services to clients. It is encouraging  that
this Bill includes areas like the furnishing of advice on  the  purchase  of
or investment in financial products that are  not  regulated  by  any  other
legislative measure in the  country.  In  that  regard  the  Bill  seeks  to
establish a newly properly regulated profession. From the IFP side  we  also
hope, and we believe, that the question  of  pyramid  schemes  can  also  be
dealt with and, in particular, those who claim that they are  trying  to  do
everything for the community whilst, in actual fact,  they  are  the  people
who are ripping off the poor customers.

The result of this Bill will be the systemisation  and  the  rationalisation
of the current fragmented regulation  of  activities  that  are  similar  in
nature. A more uniform approach, as well as  the  necessary  standardisation
in the regulation of such activities, by  a  single  regulator  will  remove
confusion  and  will  result  in  a  more   professional   and   responsible
intermediary sector. The clients of financial services, whose protection  is
at the heart of this Bill, will also be better informed.

During the drafting of the Bill a deliberate  attempt  was  made  to  create
regulatory flexibility by providing for circumscribed discretionery  powers.
Where the registrar's powers are such as to  increase  the  ability  to  act
swiftly and decisively, checks and balances have been introduced to  protect
fundamental rights. Provision is made for  consultation  with  the  Advisory
Committee on Financial Services Providers in the making  of  regulations  on
the requirements for authorisation as well  as  the  drafting  of  codes  of
conduct. There are also provisions  for  the  phasing  in  of  authorisation
provisions and the granting of appropriate exemptions where justified.

The Bill attracted a lot of interest in the financial services sector.  Many
comments on the Bill were received, all of  which  were  considered  by  the
drafters. The final text of the Bill is the result of  a  collective  effort
by the drafters and the interested parties who contributed to its content.

On something different, I could not help noticing that the defection  Bills,
with their constitutional  consequences,  are  being  fast-tracked  in  such
great haste that they cannot even be translated. I reserve  my  comments  on
that and I do not raise an objection. However, it makes one think about  the
morality and the reasons  behind  the  implementation  of  these  particular
Bills.

With regard to the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Bill I  must
advise that the IFP will support this Bill.

Ms S B NQODI: Chairperson and hon members of the House, one of  the  biggest
challenges facing the Department of Finance at this point  in  time  in  our
national democratic transformation is to create an economy that  provides  a
better life for all. Having looked at  some  of  our  financial  structures,
their history, operations and impact on the lives  of  the  people  of  this
country, the promulgation of this piece of legislation became a necessity.

Over the years, either through our own personal  experiences  or  by  direct
observation of what  was  happening  to  our  family  members,  friends  and
colleagues, as consumers, we have at one stage or the other been exposed  to
and victimised by some unscrupulous  operators  in  the  financial  services
industry, such as insurance brokers, bank officials,  managers  and  so  on.
For most of these financial advisers, the  priority  in  their  industry  or
business has been absolute profit maximisation for most of the time  at  the
expense of the unsuspecting and sometimes  ignorant  clients  who  are  sold
inappropriate financial products of which very little is known. Due  to  the
lack of knowledge, it has been  difficult  for  the  client  to  distinguish
between good and bad financial products.

As stated, the main objectives of this Bill are to  regulate  the  rendering
of certain financial advisory and intermediary services  and  to  repeal  or
amend certain laws as well as provide for  matters  incidental  thereto.  To
put it more simply, and for the benefit of  our  common  understanding,  the
Bill before us seeks to control and provide a regulatory framework  for  the
financial services providers. These are entities  providing  advice  on  all
kinds of financial products such as  insurance  policies,  medical  schemes,
loans, bank or cash deposits, life, disability and  funeral  cover  policies
and financial investments of all kinds available on the market.

Because of the fragmented  nature  under  which  these  entities  have  been
operating,  this  Bill  seeks  to  establish  a  new,   properly   regulated
profession  that  is  going  to  be  more   transparent,   responsible   and
accountable  to  consumers.  This  will  result  in  the  streamlining   and
rationalisation of the current fragmented regulation of activities into  one
single regulatory body. Politically, therefore, this is a  very  progressive
and transformatory Bill founded on the  democratic  principles  of  a  fair,
just and clean  system  of  governance.  As  we  all  know,  these  are  the
cornerstones of our policy blueprint as Government, namely the RDP.
It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  ANC  supports  the  passing  of   this
legislation. As a consumer protection measure, the Bill  covers  new  ground
never before regulated by any other legislative  measure  in  this  country,
especially with regard to the furnishing of advice on  the  purchase  of  or
investment in financial products.

In the past, the determinants for access to  full  disclosure  of  available
financial products, to credit and to better  and  more  profitable  products
and financial institutions such as Boland and Saambou banks  -  hon  members
will remember this - were based on one's skin colour and  one's  social  and
economic status, even to the extent of one's political affiliations  amongst
the white people themselves.  The  passing  of  this  Bill  will  definitely
recognise and improve both the social and economic status  of  most  of  the
people of South  Africa  irrespective  of  race,  gender  and  or  political
affiliation.

Given the profile and character of our society, however, which has  been  or
is  still  distinguished  by  sharp   divides   in   levels   of   literacy,
socioeconomic differences, race and gender. Therefore most  of  the  victims
of these discriminatory policies and  operations  of  the  majority  of  the
financial service providers mentioned earlier have  been  the  poor,  rural-
based, illiterate blacks, especially  women,  widows  and  pensioners.  They
lost great amounts of money in savings schemes, bonds and  other  investment
schemes through lack  of  access  and  exposure  to  better  facilities  and
financial institutions.

These  did   not   exclude   aspiring   black   businesspeople   and   black
professionals. They included teachers in the field of education,  nurses  in
the health sector and those working in law and  other  professions.  Because
of those very  discriminatory  policies,  even  this  group  of  people  had
limited  choices  or  selection  of  the  financial  products  or  financial
institutions, despite the fact that they had the resources.  Often,  because
of their eagerness to save or invest the little  money  they  had  at  their
disposal, they fell into the traps and a cobweb of confusion as a result  of
exploitation, rip-offs and bad advice on the  financial  products  available
to and affordable by them in the market.

The passing of this Bill will ensure that clients being  rendered  financial
services will henceforth be able to make informed decisions and  that  their
financial needs, regarding the financial products  sold  to  them,  will  be
appropriately and suitably satisfied. This is an obligation  which  will  be
outlined in the code of conduct that will  govern  this  industry.  In  this
way, it is hoped  that  this  Bill  will  open  opportunities  for  improved
savings and  better  investments  for  the  majority  of  consumers  through
providing  a  wide  selection  and  choice   of   financial   products   and
institutions available and accessible to them. It is hoped  that  that  will
be effected through the immediate implementation of clause 32 of  the  Bill,
which provides for, and I quote  the  ``promotion  of  client  education  by
registrar'' regarding  financial  services  providers  during  the  proposed
phasing in of the Act.

An important quantifiable  benefit  outlined  in  the  main  report  of  the
Financial Services Board, which was presented to the  committee  last  year,
was the creation of a complaints  resolution  mechanism  for  consumers,  ie
what is called the Office of the Ombud in  the  Bill.  It  is  an  important
tenet of marketing that the consumer should beware. It behoves consumers  to
evaluate advice and product  benefits  for  themselves  before  making  firm
commitments. It should be taken advantage of and exploited to the full.

Lastly, it is  hoped  that,  through  this  Bill,  the  emerging  previously
disadvantaged brokers will be given a fair  chance  to  participate  in  the
financial services industry through an  all-inclusive  regulatory  framework
which gives  recognition  to  different  categories  of  intermediaries  and
financial providers. Most of them serve the black market and fall  into  the
emerging category of brokers. In this way, competition and fair  play  among
the various  financial  service  providers  will  be  encouraged.  That,  in
return, will benefit consumers and clients.
The ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Mr Chairman, hon Deputy Minister and hon  members,  this  Bill
will regulate the  business  of  rendering  financial  services  to  clients
regarding a wide range of financial service products.  What  is  significant
is that providers of products need to be licensed and  professional  conduct
will be controlled through adequate control measures.

The ambit of this Bill has been extended and covers ground not regulated  by
any  other  legislation,  such  as  the  furnishing  of   advice   regarding
investment in financial products. Financial advisers will  not  be  able  to
absolve themselves if they sell questionable, nonviable products.  The  Bill
is  user-friendly  and  will  provide   a   valuable   systematisation   and
rationalisation of the current fragmented regulatory  legal  framework.  The
prime focus of this Bill is to protect clients in particular  and  consumers
in general.

The financial sector is vitally  important  for  sustained  future  economic
growth. The question that must  be  asked  is  whether  the  existing  legal
framework provides  adequate  protection  to  vulnerable  investors.  I  can
mention numerous examples where investors were deliberately misled by  empty
promises of unattainably high rates of return. What is  noteworthy  is  that
this Bill, once promulgated, will be administered by the Financial  Services
Board, which is funded by a levy system imposed on  the  financial  services
industry.

What  this,  in  essence,  means  is  that  this  Bill  has  no   financial,
organisational  or  personnel  implications  for  the  state.  The  cost  of
compliance is stipulated. The creation of the office  of  the  registrar  of
financial services providers is a very important step. Specific  powers  for
the registrar to intervene swiftly and effectively will be  to  the  benefit
of all respective role-players concerned.

Voor die finalisering van dié konsepwet is daar  met  'n  verteenwoordigende
aantal belangegroepe  in  die  finansiële  sektor  op  'n  deursigtige  wyse
gekonsulteer. Dit is my oordeel dat hierdie konsepwet nie  inbreuk  maak  op
die individuele regte, soos uiteengesit  in  die  Grondwet  nie  en  werklik
kardinale leemtes  vul;  veral  waar  finansiële  instellings  of  individue
voornemende beleggers van  advies  bedien  wat  slegs  korttermyn  geldelike
voordele vir die adviseur of verteenwoordigende finansiële instelling  inhou
en nie voornemende beleggings sonder enige  regsaanspreeklikheid  laat  nie.
Hierdie toedrag van sake sal verander ná dié wet gepromulgeer is.

Ander  professionele  kodes  soos  byvoorbeeld   die   regsberoep   en   die
medisyneberoep het baie streng gedragskodes  en  daarom  is  dit  ontsettend
belangrik dat ons ook die professionele gedragskode wat  betrekking  het  op
finansiële adviseurs ook hieronder kategoriseer.

'n Ander aspek wat genoem  is  deur  die  voorsitter  van  hierdie  komitee,
naamlik die posisie  van  mediese  adviseur  word  goed  beliggaam  en  goed
bewoord in hierdie wet en beide hierdie  twee  belanggegroepe  geakkommodeer
word in hierdie wet. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Before we finalised this draft Bill, we  consulted  in  a  transparent  way
with a representative number of interest groups in the financial sector.  In
my judgment, this draft Bill does not infringe on the individual  rights  as
set out in the Constitution and it certainly; rectifies  serious  omissions;
especially where financial institutions or individuals  furnish  prospective
investors with advice that solely represents  short-term  benefits  for  the
advisor  or  representative  financial  institution  and  does   not   leave
prospective  investments  with  any  legal  accountability.  This  state  of
affairs will change once this law has been promulgated.

Other professional codes, for instance, the legal and  medical  professions,
have very strict codes of conduct and therefore it  is  extremely  important
that we also place the code of conduct pertaining to financial  advisors  in
this category.

Another aspect that was mentioned by the chairman of this committee,  namely
the position of medical advisor is well-embodied and  well-phrased  in  this
legislation and both these two interest groups  have  been  accommodated  in
this legislation.]

This Bill is much-needed and will  contribute  to  a  financial  culture  of
universal ethical conduct, and transparent and fair business practice.

The New NP supports this Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Mr Chairperson and hon members, the Financial Advisory  and
Intermediary Services Bill is a first attempt  to  create  a  comprehensive,
all-encompassing   regulatory   environment   for   the   financial   advice
profession. This Bill seeks to regulate the  function  of  giving  financial
advice to protect the interests of the public while also  keeping  the  cost
of compliance realistic.

The Bill deals with a number of important measures such  as  the  following.
Firstly, it deals with the codes of conduct with  which  authorised  service
providers and their representatives have to comply. Secondly, it deals  with
a range of duties of authorised financial services providers that  needs  to
be carried out. Thirdly, it deals with a  number  of  enforcement  measures,
including the creation of an independent ombud scheme for the resolution  of
disputes between authorised financial services providers or  representatives
and their  clients.  Hopefully,  the  financial  advisory  and  intermediary
services ombud will be appointed before the end  of  the  current  financial
year.

The Bill before us now concludes  a  long  consultative  process,  with  the
drafting process alone having  lasted  two  years.  The  list  of  names  of
parties consulted on the Bill fills more than seven pages in this  Bill.  In
addition,  several  public  workshops  and  public   radio   and   broadcast
programmes were conducted on the Bill. It  is  true  that  consultations  on
this Bill were properly and extensively conducted. One of  the  reasons  why
this Bill was delayed recently was as a result of the standoff  between  the
Financial Services Board  and  the  Council  for  Medical  Schemes  for  the
control of health care intermediaries.

We are satisfied that the accreditation of health  brokers  by  the  Medical
Schemes  Act  will  not  dilute  the  control  over  health  brokers.   Such
accreditation will  only  take  place  provided  that  the  fit  and  proper
requirements of the FAIS Bill have been met  by  such  health  brokers.  The
health brokers will be subject to this Bill.

We congratulate the Ministries of Finance and Health  on  their  efforts  to
reach an acceptable agreement on the control over health brokers. A  special
word of thanks, I think, is due  to  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Finance.  We
reject the argument that the Bill represents an overregulation and  that  it
will be expensive to administer. This Bill is primarily for  the  protection
of the public and clients of financial services providers.

The UDM supports the Financial  Advisory  and  Intermediary  Services  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon Ministers  and  members,  prudent  advice  on
good investments and savings is key to  financial  security  and  stability.
Most ordinary people rely on trained agents and brokers to decide  for  them
which schemes will make their money grow.  This  complete  reliance  on  the
integrity and honesty of the advisers or brokers was generally seen ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members,  I  have  appealed
to you to heed my call, but at the moment  I  think  that  almost  everyone,
without exception, is taking part  in  different  debates.  [Interjections.]
Those who are seated by themselves are excluded from that.

Order! Hon members, it is impossible for the person who is speaking here  to
try and address anyone when there is just about no one  who  is  willing  to
listen. The hon member may proceed.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, I said that this complete reliance  on  integrity
and honesty  of  the  advisers  or  brokers  was  generally  sealed  on  the
gentlemen's agreement  principle.  However,  legislation  demanding  ethical
responsibility from the financial services provider was weak until now.  The
ACDP commends the Ministry of Finance for introducing this Bill  because  it
aims to address that limitation.

The office of the  ombud  is  particularly  key  to  facilitating  financial
services providers' obligations in regard to their clients. Clients, on  the
other hand, will enjoy reasonable access to lodge complaints where they  can
show that the services offered did not comply with  ethical  standards.  The
introduction of a  code  of  conduct  creates  a  legislative  framework  to
protect both the client and company, and provides for the creation of  trust
in transactional agreements. The important aspect contained in this  section
is the transparency of information required,  which  will  lead  the  client
towards making an informed decision.

Clients usually come with diverse financial needs. What seems to  happen  is
that, in  certain  cases,  they  leave  a  consultation  having  received  a
financial  package  that  they  eventually  will  not  be  able  to  sustain
financially. This has often happened  to  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  Many
financial advisers create the impression that they care  for  the  financial
needs of their clients, but often the advice given results  in  the  adviser
getting the highest commission possible. The  application  of  the  code  of
conduct should help to allay some of the fears apparent within the sector.

The ACDP expresses its support  for  the  view  that  the  registration  and
licensing of intermediaries and financial advisers is a step  in  the  right
direction. Keeping appropriate administrative and  accounting  records  will
also seek to promote sound practice within the sector.

One of the concerns raised during the deliberations on  this  Bill  was  the
cost of implementing the legislation. The overall assessment indicates  that
though there might be certain expenses incurred by the  industry,  the  Bill
holds certain benefits for the consumer that far outweigh the  minimal  loss
to the sector. What this means is that fewer lapses of policies  are  likely
to occur and that lower premiums and greater returns will help  to  generate
better financial practices from both the industry and clients alike.

We have already seen how many companies as big as Enron and  the  accounting
firm Arthur Andersen become  involved  in  unethical  conduct.  We  are  all
normally under the impression that bigger companies are supposed to  operate
under sound management. South Africa has its  fair  share  of  institutional
weaknesses and weak ethical standards. The Bill removes this  illusion  that
big is necessarily better by requiring all financial services  providers  to
conform  to  legislative  good  practices  rather  than  relying  upon   the
limitations embedded in the principle of goodwill.

The ACDP therefore wholeheartedly supports this Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I would like to make a humble  appeal  to  all
hon members: When I talk you shall listen. [Laughter.]

The MF takes its hat off to the department for having drawn up this Bill  in
the fashion in which it has. The subject has been researched and  it  covers
a wide spectrum of the concerns relating to the Bill in question. Thus,  the
Bill provides clarity and better  interpretation  to  the  faculty  that  it
covers.

The devising of a much more adequate and clear-cut guide to  the  doings  of
financial advisers and to those to whom service is being  rendered  is  long
overdue and is greatly needed. Regarding the Bill, it is  pleasing  to  note
the mechanisms that have  been  put  in  place  in  order  to  regulate  its
progress. The necessity to register oneself as a financial adviser  will  be
to the advantage  of  both  the  profession  and  the  person  seeking  such
service.

The  importance  of  proper   regulation   over   financial   advisory   and
intermediary services is most crucial in view of the  need  to  protect  the
financial wellbeing of the person seeking assistance and the  investor.  The
regulations, however, are not too strict or burdensome  for  the  authorised
financial services providers and their representatives. The  MF  feels  that
that should be considered.

It is appropriate that services will be rendered and monitored through  this
Bill. It proposes to protect the profession by marking out those  who,  like
scavengers, work in the trade by catching consumers  who  seek  professional
assistance.

The MF supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr N M NENE: Chairperson, once again, the ANC's commitment  to  the  Freedom
Charter is being demonstrated in this Bill. All people are equal before  the
law.

Financial services are rendered to all people  of  this  country,  rich  and
poor, educated and illiterate, black and white. The extent  to  which  these
products are understood  has  far-reaching  implications  for  some  of  the
clients and, more particularly, the semiliterate and  the  illiterate,  who,
in most cases, are poor and, unfortunately, black.

This Bill seeks to protect all clients, irrespective of  their  standing  in
society, black or white. At the heart of this Bill is the protection of  the
consumer against unscrupulous  financial  services  providers.  One  of  the
things that this Bill does is to define what the financial products are  and
what a financial services provider is.

Further, it lays down the enforcement mechanisms,  which  I  would  like  to
focus on in this debate. An office of an  independent  and  impartial  ombud
will be set up, and the objective of this office is to consider and  dispose
of all complaints in a procedurally fair, informal and expeditious manner.

It is expected that the financial services provider will, in terms  of  this
Bill, make certain disclosures to the client. Financial  services  providers
will have to disclose their commission, will have to  explain  the  benefits
to the clients, will have  to  furnish  proof  that  the  financial  service
provider is licensed and will also have to conduct a proper financial  needs
analysis for the clients, in order to render their appropriate services.

When dealing with a complaint, the  ombud  will  have  to  do  this  with  a
reference to what is equitable in  all  circumstances  with  regard  to  the
contractual arrangement,  or  any  other  legal  relationship,  between  the
client and financial services provider.

Once the ombud has considered the matter, a financial determination will  be
made, which may result in the dismissal of the complaint  or  the  upholding
of the complaint, wholly or partially, in which case the complainant may  be
awarded fair compensation for any financial prejudice  or  damage  suffered,
or a directive may  be  issued  that  the  financial  services  provider,  a
representative or any other party concerned takes such steps in relation  to
the complaint as the ombud deems appropriate. The ombud may make  any  other
order which a court of law may make.

The ombud is required to keep records and report annually to  the  Financial
Services Board. This report must cover the  affairs  and  functions  of  the
ombud, including the annual financial statements, and copies should also  be
submitted to the Minister of Finance.

Provision is  also  made  for  financial  service  providers  to  embark  on
rigorous programmes to educate consumers, in order to  make  them  aware  of
their rights, as far as this Bill is concerned.

In the name of transparency, more  than  400  institutions  and  individuals
were consulted and a number of hearings and submissions were made to  arrive
at the final product, and I am glad that most of  the  speakers  highlighted
this.

It has taken over two years of extensive consultation and a  lot  of  public
involvement to arrive at this final product.  I  take  this  opportunity  to
commend the Financial Services Board and the Ministry  of  Finance  for  the
amount of work that has gone into this Bill,  and  wish  them  well  in  the
implementation phase.

I am glad, also, that there was a response to the remark  made  by  the  hon
Hennie Bekker about a shotgun being used to kill a fly. This is not  at  all
overregulation. It is also interesting to note that the ACDP  supports  this
Bill wholeheartedly. That is also highly commended.

However, in his speech, the hon Green mentioned some of  the  problems  that
we have had. He mentioned Enron and Arthur Andersen but he did  not  mention
Miracle 2000. I think that was an omission.

The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I would like to  thank  all  of
the members who have  participated  in  this  debate.  Perhaps  it  is  more
important to really thank the portfolio committee,  because  they  did  very
thorough work on this piece of legislation, and I think  that  by  its  very
nature this legislation required that kind of attention because, over  time,
there have been too many stories and too  many  experiences  of  people  who
have been hoodwinked, misled and all of these things. So, indeed,  the  work
that the committee did on the legislation is very commendable.

Of course, the issue that was raised about  industry  capture  is  a  matter
that we are equally concerned about.  Members  will  recall  that  from  the
early days of the new dispensation, consultation with  consumer  bodies  was
not even something that was on the cards, but now it is something  that  has
become part and parcel of consultation.

What we are looking at now is actually beefing up the voice of consumers  in
these kinds of bodies that we set up to advise us. That is a matter that  we
are very concerned about.

The proposal about a full-on debate on the single regulator is, I  think,  a
good one which I will take up with the  Minister.  Hon  members  would  have
already seen that the Financial Mail has fired the opening salvos  on  this.
That was based on some interaction with us, with them sending  us  questions
and us responding. I really think that it is an opportune time  to  consider
that.

About some of the issues raised by the hon Taljaard, who I can see is  here,
I think that it must be said that the concerns  raised  are  valid  concerns
but, at the same time, I think that in legislating in the way  that  we  are
doing we must also understand that we cannot, in  this  day  and  age,  have
laissez faire even in the financial services  industry.  Again,  there  have
been too many experiences and  too  many  failures.  Here  in  South  Africa
alone, we can talk of quite a number. We do not even have  to  go  to  Enron
and others. We can talk Regal, we can talk Miracle 2000 and so on.

There really is a need for us to make sure that the growth  and  development
of any sector happen on the basis of good practices, because  I  think  that
if sectors grow on the basis of bad practices, then we are not  serving  the
long-term interests of our economy and our people.

Of course, we have got to be balanced in the way that we legislate.  I  also
think part of the issue here is that the  cost  of  regulation  to  industry
must always be weighed against the cost suffered by consumers and  investors
when we do not have the kind of  regulation  that  ensures  we  can  prevent
failures. So we always have to balance those two issues.

The responsibility of consumers is an important point and, in our view,  the
responsibility of  consumers  can  best  be  exercised  when  consumers  are
enlightened. So,  on  the  issue  of  consumer  education,  we  amended  the
Financial Services Board legislation to make it mandatory  for  the  FSB  to
conduct consumer education. This becomes an  important  point  here.  People
will be able to exercise responsibility when they have  that  enlightenment,
but also when there is disclosure. That gives  the  people  the  information
for them to be able to make decisions.
However, we appreciate the points being raised.  Clearly,  as  we  implement
this legislation and as we learn from practical experience,  we  shall  have
to come back to all of these  issues  and  refine,  strengthen  and  tighten
things as we gain experience. But, indeed, I would like  to  thank  all  the
members for participating in the debate.

Perhaps the point I did not touch upon is  the  issue  of  the  Policyholder
Protection Rules. Again, this is a matter that we have to have in this  way,
in the transition to the new dispensation, because  we  want  to  make  sure
that we do not have things that fall through the cracks as we  migrate  from
the old to the new.

We have discussed this matter with the industry,  to  say  that  we  do  not
intend to create hardships for them, but it is important for  us  to  retain
these in the meantime, because we will  have  financial  services  providers
who, for one  reason  or  another,  are  not  registered  in  terms  of  the
provisions of this particular legislation. We must still be  able  to  cover
them as well. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, you  are  reminded
that you are all cordially invited to the President's cocktail party in  the
Old Assembly dining hall. The hon Minister in the Presidency  says  it  will
be now, so he will direct you to where it is.

The House adjourned at 17:56.
