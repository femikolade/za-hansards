                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr F BENGU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock reports that 166 children have died of starvation in
       11 hospitals in the northern areas of the Eastern Cape;


  (2) further notes with concern that most of  the  children  who  died  of
       starvation in the rural parts of the Eastern Cape were under the  age
       of seven years  and,  therefore,  were  eligible  for  child  support
       grants;


  (3) believes that the cornerstone of Government's  overall  programme  of
       transformation is the eradication of poverty and racial  inequalities
       caused by the apartheid system, and that  Government  has  introduced
       the child support grant to protect children from the  vicious  circle
       of poverty; and


  (4) calls on all stakeholders responsible for  the  facilitation  of  the
       child support grant to ensure that  deserving  children  receive  the
       child support grant.

[Applause.]
Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the  next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Auditor-General found that the ANC's rule of Cape  Town  was
           marked by chaotic financial management; and

[Interjections.]


       (b)  the  ANC-run  town  of  Saron  in  the  Western  Cape  is  being
           investigated for poor financial record-keeping, unauthorised  or
           irregular payments and the unauthorised deposit of council money
           into a personal account;

[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mrs G M BORMAN:


  (2) notes with astonishment that the ANC has announced that Ms  Nomaindia
       Mfeketo, under whose previous Cape Town mayoralty the financial  mess
       took place, would be their mayoral candidate for Cape Town; and

[Interjections.]


  (3) expresses the hope that the ratepayers of Cape Town will not have  to
       suffer under a resumption of power by the financially incompetent ANC
       and Ms Mfeketo.

[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order, order! Hon members, these are supposed to be notices  of
motion. That means you should be listening.

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that according to the  Pharmaceutical  Society  of
       South Africa counterfeit drugs  from  other  countries'  illegitimate
       pharmaceutical industries, which costs the country up to R2 billion a
       year, could be dangerous for people who take them;


  (2) urges all stakeholders concerned to recognise, and not turn  a  blind
       eye, and take action against this illegal industry; and


  (3) hopes that the relevant authorities will  do  their  utmost  to  stop
       these counterfeit drugs from entering and being distributed in  South
       Africa.

Miss P S SEGOBELA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that  on  the  next  sitting

  Dat die Huis kennis neem dat -


  (1) die Nuwe NP besorg is oor die proses van keuring en  aanstelling  van
       senior bestuurders in die Staatsdiens en dit  ongehoord  is  dat  elf
       persone op bestuursvlak na twee jaar gedagvaar  moet  word  om  hulle

(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the
next sitting day of the House, I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the New National Party is concerned about the  process  of  selection
       and appointment of senior managers in the Public Service,  and  finds
       it shocking  that  eleven  people  at  managerial  level  had  to  be
       summonsed after two years to submit their  original  certificates  as
       proof of their qualifications; and


  (2) the New National Party requests the Minister and the  Public  Service
       Commission to -


       (a)  take firm action against the persons in question; and


       (b)  in future not  to  appoint  or  promote  any  persons  prior  to
           thoroughly  checking  and  confirming  the  validity  of   their
           educational qualifications.]
Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the  next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its unreserved horror and  disgust  with  revelations  that
       more than 160 children have died  of  starvation  this  year  in  the
       Eastern Cape alone;


  (2) notes that these revelations are made at a time when the Minister  of
       Social  Development  has  expressed  reservations  about  the   funds
       disbursed to charities from the National Lottery;


  (3) further notes that problems in applying for  identity  documents  are
       preventing desperately poor beneficiaries from  claiming  the  social
       grants that stand between them and poverty; and


  (4) calls for immediate joint action  between  the  Departments  of  Home
       Affairs and of Social Development, as  well  as  the  provincial  and
       local government  spheres  to  address  this  unacceptable  state  of
       affairs, where a country  with  a  surplus  of  food  can  allow  the
       starvation of children.

Mr R J B MOHALALA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Telkom has developed a ``unique'' model for  creating  and
       retaining jobs;


  (2) further notes that  this  plan  involves  ensuring  that  potentially
       redundant employees  are  absorbed  into  business  units  which  are
       growing within Telkom, and this plan has received  support  from  the
       Communication Workers Union and the Alliance of Telkom Unions;


  (3) believes that the initiative  by  Telkom  contributes  positively  to
       fighting unemployment and poverty;


  (4) commends Telkom for embarking on this initiative; and
  (5) calls on other companies to emulate this important example.

[Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness that the rape of innocent children in this country
       has dramatically increased over the past few years;


  (2) believes that the easy availability of pornography has played a major
       role in inflaming the passions of  rapists,  who  are  now  targeting
       defenceless children;


  (3) endorses the calls by the majority of  South  Africans  that  capital
       punishment be reinstated and imposed on dangerous rapists who are not
       even moved to sympathy by the cries and screams of small children;


  (4) believes that the man who brutally  raped  six-year-old  Lerato  from
       Alexandra Township and left her to die with  her  intestines  hanging
       between her legs, about a week ago, does not deserve any  jail  term,
       but the death penalty;


  (5) expresses concern that a country that can protect overseas  delegates
       who are attending international conferences and summits, is  dismally
       failing to protect its citizens, particularly innocent  children  who
       are continually abducted and raped by people who do  not  care  about
       the ineffective criminal laws of our country; and


  (6) calls on the Government to -


       (a)  prioritise the eradication of child rape from our society; and


       (b)  heed the calls from our peace-loving people  and  reinstate  the
           death penalty as a matter of urgency.

[Applause.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the FA:


  That the House -


  (1) notes allegations that President Mbeki's wife bought a state property
       without the  proper  tender  process  being  followed  and  put  that
       property on the market a few months later for over R400 000 more than
       she paid for it;


  (2) expresses its concern that members of the  ANC  elite  are  enriching
       themselves at State expense; and


  (3) calls on the Government to -


       (a)  investigate the sale of the Port Elizabeth property to Mrs Mbeki
           and report to Parliament as a matter of urgency; and


       (b)  come clean on which other State assets have  been  sold  without
           following the tender procedures required by law.

[Applause.]

Miss T E LISHIVHA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  preliminary results of  research  conducted  by  the  Bureau  of
           Market  Research,  Iklwa  Structured  Financial   Products   and
           economists from Urban Econ revealed that  the  World  Summit  of
           Sustainable Development injected R8 billion into South  Africa's
           economy; and
       (b)  the report also revealed that the summit  created  approximately
           18 000 local jobs;


  (2) believes that South  Africa's  Government's  decision  to  host  this
       important summit has firmly established our country as  an  important
       tourist destination; and


  (3) commends the decision of the Government to host this historic summit.

[Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the arrest in Zimbabwe last week  of  a  retired  Judge,  Fergus
           Blackie, on trumped up charges laid by the Mugabe regime;
       (b)  proposals by President Mugabe to amend the Land Acquisition  Act
           in order to facilitate his regime's illegal  seizure  of  white-
           owned farm land; and


       (c)  South Africa's confirmation that it endorsed Libya, one  of  the
           world's most notorious abusers of human rights, as chair of  the
           UN Commission on Human Rights; and


  (2) concludes that it was a bad week for Nepad and for those who hope  to
       convince the world that human rights and good governance enjoy a high
       priority in Africa.

[Applause.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that according to the Child Poverty Monitor,  released  by  the
       Institute for  Democracy  in  South  Africa  (IDASA),  about  75%  of
       children younger than 17 lived below the poverty  line  of  R400  per
       month in 1999;


  (2) further notes that the poverty levels were  highest  in  the  Eastern
       Cape (88%), Northern Province (84%) and KwaZulu-Natal (80%); and


  (3) urges all concerned to do  their  utmost  to  reduce  the  number  of
       children living below the poverty line.

Mr S PHOHLELA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Agri-South Africa announced that commercial farmers  would
       work with  the  Government  to  ensure  that  agricultural  land  was
       transferred to black farmers as long as this is sustainable;
  (2)  believes  that  the   implementation   of   a   comprehensive   land
       redistribution programme which addresses  the  racially  skewed  land
       ownership patterns is an important component of undoing  the  effects
       of apartheid and building national unity;


  (3) welcomes the statement by Agri-South Africa that they  would  support
       the land reform programme; and


  (4) calls on white commercial farmers to work with the  beneficiaries  of
       the land reform programmes, and to assist them in making their  farms
       productive and viable.

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Rand declined after Mr Gilingwe Mayende, the Director-
       General of Land Affairs, stated that the Government will  invoke  the
       right to expropriate agricultural land in the public interest, if the
       principle of willing buyer/seller fails to meet land reform goals;


  (2) urgently requests the Minister for Agriculture and  Land  Affairs  to
       reconfirm that secure property rights constitute a  prerequisite  for
       investor confidence and sustained healthy economic growth; and


  (3) appeals to the Government to take precautionary measures  to  prevent
       similar future statements, which can  be  detrimental  to  the  South
       African economy.

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) is alarmed with shock and  trepidation  at  the  unilateral  decision
       taken by the mayor of Tzaneen Municipality  and  the  MEC  for  Local
       Government in the Limpopo province to change the  name  of  the  town
       Tzaneen to ``Mark Shope'' without consultation with the local  people
       or the inhabitants of the area;


  (2) notes with disgust that  the  name  change  was  made  and  announced
       without approval from the South African Geographical Names Commission
       and the  Minister  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and  Technology,  as
       required by law;


  (3) is convinced that the vast majority of the  inhabitants  of  Tzaneen,
       political parties, traditional leaders and other stakeholders in  the
       area are diametrically  opposed  to  the  name  change,  and  contend
       strongly that the name should not be changed;


  (4) is convinced that the name Tzaneen  or  Tsaneng  does  not  have  any
       offensive political, ethnic or racial connotations, and that it has a
       balancing  historical,  linguistic  and  indigenous   meaning   which
       communicates and reflects the  spirit  of  the  communities  and  the
       African Renaissance; and


  (5) calls upon the South African Geographical Names  Commission  and  the
       Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology to  heed  the  call
       and the will of the people in and around Tzaneen.

   CELEBRATING HERITAGE DAY TOGETHER AS SOUTH AFRICANS TO ACHIEVE UNITY IN
                                  DIVERSITY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms M A  A  NJOBE:  Madam  Speaker  and  hon  members,  I  feel  honoured  to
participate in this very  important  debate  commemorating  and  remembering
Heritage Day.

In its 1997 Mafikeng Conference, the ANC recognised that owing to a host  of
historical reasons the identities accepted by the  people  of  South  Africa
are rooted in ethnic, racial, cultural, linguistic and regional factors.  It
then resolved  that  it  is  important  that  we  come  to  terms  with  the
significance of all these identities,  both  in  our  movement  and  in  our
country.  These  identities  are  not  necessarily   divisive.   They   have
progressive aspects that can be harnessed as  part  of  our  nation-building
project.
The main aim of celebrating Heritage Day as a national day is  to  bring  us
together as one nation, a  South  African  nation.  As  we  draw  closer  to
Heritage Day on 24 September  2002,  we  must  make  a  firm  resolution  to
celebrate our heritage as  South  Africans  together  to  achieve  unity  in
diversity. This country has spent a  lot  of  time  and  resources  and  has
sacrificed the lives of people struggling to achieve unity  of  the  diverse
peoples that live in it. Obviously the struggle for unity still continues.

As South Africans, on 24 September 2002  we  will  be  contributing  in  the
process of welding a  sense  of  nationhood  among  ourselves.  We  will  be
collectively celebrating our common values as espoused in  the  Constitution
and these are, among other things, equality of  race,  equality  of  gender,
equality of religion, equality of language and equality of  culture  in  its
totality. All these,  among  many,  constitute  heritage.  I  believe  there
should be equality in all respects and respect for that equality, for  unity
to be achieved.

The  theme  for  this  year's  Heritage  Day  as  pronounced  by  the   lead
department, the Department of Arts and Culture, is  that  we  celebrate  our
national symbols, namely the national flag, the national  anthem,  the  coat
of arms, the national bird, the fish, the tree and the  national  orders.  I
assume all the  members  of  Parliament  know  these  national  symbols  and
orders. The key values underpinning the key national symbols, the flag,  the
anthem and the coat of arms, are  reconciliation,  unity  in  diversity  and
nation-building.

The significance of these national symbols is to bind  us  together  into  a
nation and make us proudly South African.  In  reality,  the  fact  is  that
every day is a heritage day and there are  more  national  symbols  that  we
should promote.  These  are  heritage  symbols  that  constitute  our  value
systems and practices. Our  national  flag  symbolises  a  country  and  its
people. It represents a rich heritage of our history and  binds  us  to  one
another. Our flag has no doubt caused a  great  enthusiasm  among  us  South
Africans.  This  has  been  witnessed  in  sporting   activities,   in   the
commemoration of special days and so on.  It  is  the  emblem  of  our  very
existence. There is widespread acceptance of our flag across  the  political
and the cultural spectrum.

The central design of the flag, beginning  with  a  vee  at  the  hoist  and
coming together in the centre of the flag, extending as a single  horizontal
bond to the outer  edge  of  the  fly,  can  be  seen  as  representing  the
convergence of the diverse elements in South  African  society,  which  then
together, take the road ahead in unison. This idea of unity and  convergence
links up with the motto of the national coat of arms, which means  unity  in
strength. Our flag has, without a shadow of doubt, found its  way  into  the
hearts and minds of the population at large  and  has  become  the  unifying
symbol which  South  Africa  as  a  nation  needs.  We  see  it,  naturally,
everywhere. We see it on people's faces. We see it  on  cultural  artefacts.
We literally see it everywhere and our flag seems to  be  adaptable  to  all
kinds of situations as people express themselves in  unity.  Its  acceptance
by the nation at large is one of  the  success  stories  of  the  new  South
Africa. It has, indeed united the nation.

Heritage is a system of symbols, tangible and  intangible,  that  shape  our
culture. Heritage is a source that shapes our moral and economic  lives.  It
is highly valuable and fragile. It is hard to renew. Heritage resources  are
reservoirs of memories of people, libraries  and  museums.  As  we  approach
this Heritage Day, let us resolve to enjoy our heritage, let us  resolve  to
visit our reservoirs to determine whether they tell our story. Do they  tell
us where we come from, who we are and what we want our children  and  future
generations to learn and to be?

A week ago I spoke to a friend of mine and expressed my resolution to  visit
a local library and a museum at least once a  week.  Her  response  was  not
encouraging. She remarked that our libraries,  museums  and  heritage  sites
are not yet a mirror of our nation. I  take  her  remark  seriously  and  it
serves as a motivation to go on a tour of all  heritage  centres.  I  invite
members, therefore, to resolve to address the  concerns  of  South  Africans
who want  to  develop  their  heritage.  I  think  we  need  to  assess  the
effectiveness  of  various  institutions  we  have  established  to  develop
national heritage.  We  must  lead  their  transformation.  We  must  assess
whether  the  books  that  we  buy  provide  for  the  development  of   our
communities and for the education of the South African nation. Is  there  an
adequate stock of resources to facilitate the transformation  of  the  South
African culture, the languages, the natural sciences and technology?

Madam Speaker, a programme contributing to greater awareness  of  our  unity
in diversity and the need for common South  African  patriotism  has  to  be
introduced, but of course, with sensitivity in schools in particular,  after
consultation with the stakeholders.  Over  the  years  we  have  established
museums to serve as centres of heritage conservation and development.  These
museums are meant also to serve as recreation centres for local and  foreign
tourists. The question remains, however, whether they serve  the  needs  and
the interests of all the people.

Some people may be wondering what relevance the name Iziko has  to  museums.
This is the name given to the Cape Town museums  collectively,  but,  as  we
know Iziko is a fireplace for cooking; for providing light, warmth  and  for
the family to gather around and tell stories. This  is  what  people  expect
when  they  visit  Iziko  museums  and  it  must  provide  for   all   these
expectations. In  fact,  these  are  legitimate  development  needs  of  the
people. Today I invite members to create amaziko for storytelling,  transfer
of knowledge for sustainable social and economic development. We must  never
underestimate the power of storytelling  and  oral  history  as  an  African
system of development.

Our communities accommodate a rich heritage. This heritage is  presented  in
different forms,  tangible  and  intangible  forms.  There  are  places  and
features that carry memories  of  individuals,  groups  of  people  and  the
entire nation. Recently, we brought back home from France the remains  of  a
national symbol, Sarah Baartman, to lay her to rest in South Africa. I  need
not go deep into the story of Sarah's painful experiences  in  life  and  in
death, but I want to submit the legacy of Sarah Baartman as  an  opportunity
to engage in extensive research and rewrite our  history.  Her  burial  site
offers a pilgrimage for South Africans and the peoples of the  world  to  go
on a journey towards genuine respect for humanity and for dignity. It is  no
wonder that the President of the Republic of  South  Africa  pronounced  the
site a national heritage site, and that its protection  shall  breed  a  new
world order and moral order through which the world shall prosper.

There  are  many  heritage  sites  of   national,   provincial   and   local
significance. Some are associated  with  wars  that  were  fought  in  South
Africa, some relate to churches, some have  been  identified  and  they  are
protected. For example, we have Robben Island,  Makapan  Valley  in  Limpopo
and the  site  of  the  Sharpeville  massacre  in  Gauteng,  which  are  all
protected under the National Heritage Resources Act. There are many  others.
The list is quite long, including among other areas the  Freedom  Square  in
Kliptown, Chief Albert Luthuli  in  KwaDukuza,  Samora  Machel  in  Mbuzini,
Mpumalanga, the Blood River in Ncome,  the  Steve  Biko  Memorial,  the  Sol
Plaatjie Memorial and so on  and  so  forth,  and  that  also  includes  the
recently created one, the Freedom Park. By the way, there is  a  display  in
the foyer about the Freedom Park. Members are also invited to visit there.

The majority of protected sites  are  structures  and  buildings  that  have
reached pension age, that is 60 years of age. However,  a  large  number  of
heritage resources are threatened as they have not been  identified,  graded
and protected. On this Heritage Day we must return to  our  communities  and
facilitate the identification of heritage resources that must  be  protected
and conserved for this and future generations.

Madam Speaker, it is clear  that  there  are  many  ways  in  which  we  can
celebrate Heritage  Day,  but  what  is  important  is  the  nature  of  our
celebration. It should be proudly  South  African.  A  history  or  heritage
conference, a community heritage tour or a tour of a museum, time  spent  in
the company of a knowledgeable person or an elder is worth  a  heritage  day
celebration. A sport and recreation activity is a heritage celebration.  The
critical challenge facing the strengthening of our  nationhood  is  that  we
tend to make Heritage Day a private affair. There are  planned  celebrations
in all the provinces and the Department of Arts and  Culture  will  host  an
open national celebration on  24  September.  In  addition,  one  may  visit
heritage centres and celebrate with family members, friends or  a  group  of
community members.

My call, therefore, is that this year we pledge to  celebrate  our  heritage
as proud South Africans, flying our  national  flag,  singing  our  national
anthem and aiming to enjoy our rich heritage together. I do  wish  everybody
a fruitful Heritage Day. [Applause.]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: ``Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu''.  'n  Mens  is  'n  mens  deur
ander mense. [No man is an island.] Lesi sisho simqoka  kubantu  abampisholo
ngoba lesi sisho shichaza inkambo  yobuntu  botho.  [This  proverb  is  very
important to black people, because it describes the culture of humanity].

Awukho  umthetho  ongaba   nomphumela   obonakalayo   ukwakha   ukubambisana
njengesizwe esisodwa ngaphandle kokuzimisela ngezinhliziyo  zethu.  [No  law
can produce visible success in building co-operation  among  people  of  one
nation without our being serious within our heart.]

Eenheid is 'n hart-ding, nie 'n kop-ding nie. Dit kan nie met  reëls,  wette
of regulasies afgedwing word nie. [Unity comes from the heart, not from  the
mind. It cannot be enforced by way of rules, laws or regulations.]

A few days ago,  when  the  hon  the  Minister  of  Education  responded  in
Afrikaans to a question by the hon Pieter Mulder, I said to myself:  ``In  a
small way he is reaching out, and if he is reaching out  to  the  Afrikaans-
speaking community, I am not going to refuse his hand''. Of  course,  Madiba
set us the example of reaching out on the day  he  travelled  to  Orania  to
have tea with Mrs Betsie  Verwoerd.  These  little  drops  of  goodwill  are
precious and we all need to cherish them and follow the example.

At one of her functions during the weekend, the hon Thoko Didiza said:  ``As
we are busy building, there is no need to create new tensions''.

!Ke e:/xarra//ke [eenheid in diversiteit] is die nuwe leuse vir ons land  en
in die gees van ons Grondwet wil ek hoop  dat  elkeen  oor  diversiteit  sal
skrywe: ``Hanteer uiters versigtig''.

Die baie omstrede kwessie van naamsverandering is  deesdae  besig  om  orals
onnodig  temperature  op  te  jaag.  Dit  is  'n  jammerte  dat  die  uiters
belangrike Kommissie vir die Bevordering en Beskerming  van  die  Regte  van
Kulturele, Godsdienstige en Taalgemeenskappe nog nie aangestel is  nie.  Die
Minister van Kuns, Kultuur, Wetenskap en Tegnologie behoort as 'n  saak  van
dringendheid toe te sien dat dit aangestel word.

Die primêre funksies van hierdie te stigte kommissie  -  te  wete,  eerstens
die bevordering van respek vir kulturele,  godsdienstige  en  taalregte,  en
tweedens   die   bevordering   van   vrede,   vriendskap,   menswaardigheid,
verdraagsaamheid en nasionale eenheid tussen  verskillende  gemeenskappe  op
die basis van gelykheid, geen diskriminasie en  vrye  assosiasie  -  behoort
intussen die gees te wees van besluite rakende naamveranderings.

Name wat krenk en  aanstootlik  is,  moet  natuurlik  nie  behoue  bly  nie.
Wanbalanse moet natuurlik reggestel word om  ons  kulturele  diversiteit  te
weerspieël. In hierdie opsig wil ek een van my mentors, my agb kollega  Anna
van Wyk, bedank vir die beleidsrigting wat sy aangedui  het.  Om  egter  aan
name   te   peuter   wat   'n   ``skoon''   geskiedenis   het,   is   uiters
onverantwoordelik, soos ook vandag in een van die mosies te kenne gegee is.

Volgens die voorskrifte van die Nasionale Pleknamekomitee, behoort name  wat
diskriminerend is ten opsigte van ras, kleur, geloof,  geslag  en  politieke
affiliasie vermy te word.

Name wat  sonder  politieke  kontaminasie  is,  behoort  behoue  te  bly  om
absurditeite te voorkom,  soos  in  die  Suid-Kaap  waar  die  naam  van  'n
spesifieke strand sonder rede of behoorlike bestudering van  die  historiese
oorsprong daarvan verander is om sodoende by 'n  bepaalde  politieke  agenda
te pas. Met die verandering van die politieke toneel is  die  naam  van  die
strand toe weer verander, terug  na  die  oorspronklike  naam.  Sal  hierdie
speletjie voortduur soos die politieke toneel verder verander?

Dit word waardeer dat die voorgestelde naamsverandering  van  'n  dorp  soos
Tzaneen weer terugverwys is. Ons hoop gesonde verstand sal seëvier.  Aspekte
van  administratiewe  geregtigheid,  soos  in  die  Grondwet  gewaarborg  en
gebaseer op wetlikheid, redelikheid en behoorlike prosedure, is  in  hierdie
geval totaal geïgnoreer. Die vraag is,  waarom?  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[!Ke e:/xarra//ke [unity in diversity] is the new motto for our country  and
in the spirit of our Constitution I would like to hope  that  everyone  will
write that diversity should be handled with the utmost care.

This very controversial matter of name changes has  lately  been  causing  a
lot of unnecessary flaring of tempers everywhere.  It  is  unfortunate  that
the very important Commission for Promotion  and  Protection  of  Rights  of
Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities has not been  appointed.  The
Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology  should  as  a  matter  of
urgency see to it that it is appointed.

The primary function of  this  organisation  to  be  formed  -  firstly  the
promotion of respect for cultural,  religious  and  linguistic  rights,  and
secondly, the  promotion  of  peace,  friendship,  humanity,  tolerance  and
national unity among different communities on  the  basis  of  equality,  no
discrimination and free association - should in the meantime be  the  spirit
of decisions regarding name changes.

Names that are offensive or abhorrent should  of  course  not  be  retained.
Imbalances should, of course, be rectified in order to reflect our  cultural
diversity. In this regard I would like to thank one of my  mentors,  my  hon
colleague Anna van Wyk, for the policies that she  has  indicated.  However,
to tamper with names that have a ``clean'' history  is  very  irresponsible,
as was noted today in one of the motions.

According to the instructions of the National Place  Name  Committee,  names
that are discriminatory with regard to race, colour,  religion,  gender  and
political affiliation, should be avoided. Names that are  without  political
contamination, should be retained in order to avoid absurdities, such as  in
the Southern Cape where the name of a specific  beach  was  changed  without
reason or proper research into its historical origin  in  order  to  suit  a
specific political agenda. With the change in the political scene  the  name
of the beach was once again changed back to the  original  name.  Will  this
game continue as the political scene further changes?

It is appreciated that the proposed name change of a town  such  as  Tzaneen
has been remitted. We hope that sound common sense will prevail. Aspects  of
administrative justice, as guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  and  based  on
legality, fairness  and  proper  procedure,  was  totally  ignored  in  this
instance. The question is, why?]

I believe that there is enough goodwill among  our  diverse  communities  to
handle these sensitive issues in a way that will encourage  all  communities
to join in celebrations and to move forward in establishing our  country  as
a beacon of stability and hope. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Before I call on the next  speaker,  I  would  like,  on
behalf of all hon members, to welcome in our midst  a  group  of  physically
challenged  pupils  from  the  Helen  Franz  school  in  Limpopo   Province.
[Applause.] You are most welcome to be with us today and we  thank  you  for
coming. I will now call upon the hon Cassim.

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, a  few  weeks  ago,  when  I  noticed  on  the
programme of Parliament that this debate was scheduled to take  place  after
Heritage Day, I requested that we should actually bring the  debate  forward
to before Heritage Day. The reason for that was very simple.

Over the past eight years  we  have  noticed,  on  a  number  of  occasions,
Ministers complaining about the fact that when it comes to  the  celebration
of Heritage Day generally black members of our communities and  this  nation
are coming forward to participate, but that  members  of  other  ethnic  and
race groups are visible by their absence.

Therefore, it became important and necessary for us to raise  this  question
here in Parliament to find out what could be done to address  that.  If  the
purpose of Heritage Day is actually to show our unity in diversity, then  it
has to be demonstrable and visible. But if, once again, after so many  years
- and now would be the eighth year of celebration - the same tendency as  in
the past manifests  itself,  then  it  basically  means  that  something  is
happening so that people who should be drawing closer  to  one  another  are
not in fact doing that. Therefore, we need to address this.

Now in trying to ask why we  are  having  this  problem,  I  have  tried  to
ascertain what is being done via  the  department  to  make  sure  that  all
communities from all races  and  ethnic  groups  are  actually  visible  and
participating together. Now,  the  department  has,  indeed,  put  out  many
advertisements and it has used the radio extensively to  make  certain  that
targeted groups are being reached. But, I am of the view that  in  spite  of
that we will, once again, have a situation in which all of  the  communities
of South Africa will  not  be  seen  to  be  participating  and  celebrating
together.

The question that needs to be asked is: What steps can we take so  that  the
day of unity does not become the day of disunity? I believe that we need  to
start with education, and it is just  as  well  that  the  hon  Minister  of
Education is in House. Though it is not directly  his  line  function,  with
the influence that he has in the educational sphere, I think we need to  get
the children of this country to start playing and  celebrating  together  in
order that we can build and cement  the  kind  of  unity  that,  indeed,  we
should not only be striving for now, but which we  should  be  demonstrating
is happening.
We should also be asking those who are within the Public Service,  policemen
and women, nurses of all races and colours to come forward. There should  be
some way in which the department, in future years,  can  make  certain  well
before the coming of Heritage  Day  that  communities,  even  at  the  local
government level, are given the opportunity to plan  for  Heritage  Day,  so
that when it comes we do not have to rely so much on advertising to get  the
people there. If people have produced the programmes themselves in  whatever
shape they want them, then I am very certain that there will  be  a  greater
willingness to participate, because it is a programme of their  own  making.
Then it will not become a programme where the  political  element  outweighs
the social, cultural or whatever element.

Up to now, for the past eight years, if we cast  our  minds  back,  we  will
find that most of these celebrations  have  tended  to  give  the  political
content greater weight than the cultural and the social. The appeal is:  Let
us try and get this correct, because Heritage Day is not just a holiday.  It
is, in fact, one of the most significant days to  show  the  change  between
the old and the new regimes, where in the past  there  was  a  cultural  and
racial hegemony. We now need to demonstrate that the opposite  of  that  has
actually rooted itself in South African soil and that as  a  people  we  are
willing and able to enjoy the satisfaction of  the  progress  we  have  made
together, collectively. We can  share  what  we  are  culturally  and  build
together the kind of unity that will, indeed, start making a nation  out  of
us. Although we have come very far in the past eight years, I  believe  that
in terms of  the  main  question  -  if  we  are  still  one  united  nation
manifesting that unity - we have to say that in respect of that we have  not
yet reached our destination.

So, let us hope that this Heritage Day will be much better.  Let  those  who
are listening to us in Parliament,  out  there  in  the  broader  community,
whether they are white, Indian, coloured,  brown  or  whatever  colour,  let
them all join together  and  make  this  Heritage  Day  a  landmark  in  our
cultural and political history. [Applause.]

An HON MEMBER: Madam Speaker, on a point of order, is  it  in  order  for  a
member of Parliament  to  sleep  and  snore  in  this  House?  I  have  been
observing  with  interest  the  hon  member  Nigel   Bruce,   fast   asleep.
[Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I think there is sleeping  with  your  eyes
wide open and sleeping with your eyes shut. Neither is in order, but I  will
leave it to the members to discipline themselves. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Madam Speaker, time  permitting,
I will attempt to show the connection among ditlhare -  the  trees  -  Langa
Township's 75th anniversary, tourism, Paul Coleman, the  earth  walker,  the
threat of war with Iraq and our  heritage.  We,  humans  -  the  hon  member
snoring over there included - are all similar to trees. [Laughter.] We  have
roots which  explain  where  we  come  from.  We  reach  out  our  hands  in
friendship to others like the branches of a tree reaching  out  to  the  sun
and, in fact, like the figures on our Coat of Arms which are  so  expressive
of ubuntu. If one cuts a tree or a human  being,  a  scar  remains  forever,
reminding one of that blow. Trees are symbols of life and hope.

In this country, as part of our heritage, we devised the most wonderful  way
of remembering those who gave their lives in the  struggle  for  freedom  by
planting trees in their memory so that they should never  be  forgotten.  We
plant such trees to green our land and to heal the nation. We encourage  all
our people to plant trees for the birth of a child or in memory of  a  loved
one.

We planted trees yesterday with the community, during the  75th  anniversary
celebrations of Langa Township. That was organised  by  the  hon  member  Zo
Kota. We remembered those who had fallen in the struggle  during  1960  and,
again, those who had fallen in the 1976  uprising.  We  remembered  the  man
after whom Langa  Township  was  originally  named,  King  Langalibalele  of
AmaHlubi, who was captured by  the  British  in  1873  and  incarcerated  on
Robben Island because of his rebellion against colonial rule.

We have planted trees to those warriors who have fallen in  defence  of  our
country in the many wars of our history; those who fell during the  colonial
wars of dispossession; and, in fact, those gallant Boers who fought  against
the selfsame aggression of British imperialism. Perhaps, it  is  only  today
that many can see more clearly that the Anglo-Boer War or the South  African
War, as it is more  correctly  termed,  is  part  of  the  British  imperial
power's overall wars of conquest in which all our people were victims.

Planting the trees with us  at  Langa,  yesterday,  was  Paul  Coleman  from
England who, a few months ago,  arrived  in  our  country  and  walked  from
Pietermaritzburg to the Johannesburg World Summit planting trees  en  route.
Paul is not called the earth walker for nothing.  He  walked  in  North  and
South America, from Canada to Brazil, in 1992, to the  Rio  summit.  He  has
walked in Europe and the Middle East  and  has  covered  35  000  km  in  30
countries. This morning he planted a tree  here,  in  Parliament,  with  the
Speaker. He will plant a tree on Robben Island and will soon start out  from
Cape Town on a four-year ramble that will take him  through  our  continent,
from Cape to Cairo and onto China - literally from  Robben  Island's  prison
walls to the Great Wall of China.

Paul aims to draw attention to  the  impact  of  war  on  humanity  and  the
natural environment. He has an ambition to  persuade  people  all  over  the
world to plant a tree for a every person who died in armed  conflict  during
the twentieth century - that is about a 100 million people. I think that  we
can justifiably refer to him as iqabane lendlela nemithi - a comrade of  the
road and trees. [Applause.] I would like to ask Paul  Coleman  to  rise  and
acknowledge the House. [Applause.] I would like to thank Paul very much  for
that.

Paul has merged with us and our heritage. I would like to say, in  the  fine
words of our national motto: !ke e: /xarra //ke -  diverse  people  unite  -
because of his love and respect for mother earth and for  freedom,  equality
and fraternity. Paul expresses himself by walking the  world,  reaching  out
to people and planting trees. Our country expressed that ideal at the  world
summit whose programme we are already implementing in  many  ways,  even  in
the simple act of planting trees; ensuring the provision of water and  food,
better  health  and  education;  eradication  of  poverty;  and   care   and
protection of our environment so that it can be green, healthy  and  can  be
passed on to future generations as the heritage of our country.

The heritage handed to us from our past is not simply  the  symbols  of  our
Coat of Arms,  or  the  legacy  of  rock  paintings,  songs,  music,  dance,
cultural and environmental treasures. It is all that, but  it  is  also  our
finest aspirations of freedom, democracy and equality,  which  is  what  all
that reflects and inspires. So, it is the wisdom of  centuries  of  struggle
for justice that saw our President emphasising this week  in  New  York,  as
the planet is poised for an unnecessary war against Iraq, the  role  of  the
UN as the vehicle for ensuring peace. At this hour of impending war, the  US
and Britain rattling their sabres, our President has declared that the  Non-
Aligned Movement is committed to the peaceful resolution of  all  conflicts,
including those pertaining to Palestine and  Israel  as  well  as  Iraq,  in
keeping with UN resolutions.

In the same vein, our former  President,  Nelson  Mandela,  has  warned  the
President of the world's mightiest country to  refrain  from  war  and  seek
other means. These two famous South Africans  express,  at  this  moment  of
danger to world peace, the  essence  of  our  heritage  and  wisdom  of  our
history: talk, negotiate, seek peaceful  resolution  to  conflict  and  only
resort to force where freedom and justice are  in  peril  and  there  is  no
other choice.

As we celebrate our  heritage  -  an  inclusive,  democratic  nonracist  and
nonsexist South Africa - other dark forces plot  and  conspire  to  drag  us
back into the abyss. The ultraright conspirators in our  country,  who  have
recently been uncovered by superb police work, are  isolated,  bankrupt  and
without significant support. It is highly appreciated and it is in the  best
spirit of our heritage that leaders of Afrikaner parties in this House  have
rejected conspiracies to overthrow the Government by violence.

Whilst we will not overreact to such plots, the plotters  and  any  elements
who seek to defy our Constitution and rights through violence  can  be  sure
that we will defend to the last drop of  blood  our  people's  achievements.
The assegai and iwisa - the knobkerrie in  our  Coat  of  Arms  -  are  dual
symbols of defence and authority and symbolise the wisdom and  courage  with
which we fought  for  our  freedom  and  with  which  we  will  defend  this
democracy. These weapons are  as  much  as  part  of  our  heritage  as  our
valuable cultural treasures.
Those conspirators who wish to plunge our country into blood are  living  in
the past. Those like them who remain befuddled  by  racial  poison  need  to
join us in the new South Africa. If they  were  at  Langa,  yesterday,  they
would have seen a community with its dignity  and  voluntarily  involved  in
greening and cleaning the township.  As  we  planted  the  trees  with  Paul
Coleman, an all-women band played  music  and  sang,  and  a  coach-load  of
German tourists stopped  to  join  in  the  carnival  and  danced  with  the
community. The tour guide told me that, in the past, they would  bypass  the
townships too afraid to  enter.  They  were  now  en  route  to  a  township
restaurant and the tourists were flocking into South Africa. It  is  ubuntu,
a white lady told me.`` What?'' I asked, as I thought she  had  said  it  is
the ``Bantu''. ``It is the spirit of  ubuntu'',  she  explained,  ``that  is
drawing the tourists and making them want to come back''.

Paul Coleman has experienced that  ubuntu.  He  talked  about  how  friendly
people are and is optimistic about South Africa and  the  world.  Paul  will
walk along the Garden Route and enjoy, amongst other things of  beauty,  the
mountains and fynbos. He  will  walk  through  the  Knysna  and  Tsitsikamma
forests. He will see the Amatola mountains from where  our  people  fiercely
resisted colonial conquests in frontier wars that could be  more  accurately
referred to as a 100 years war - so determined was  the  resistance  of  the
spear against gun on the Eastern Cape frontier.

When Paul reaches the northern parts of our  country,  at  the  end  of  the
year, he will be able to admire the baobab tree of the  savanna  and  obtain
vitamin C from the marula fruit and maybe protein from the  mopane  worm  to
give him added strength for his trek up Africa to Cairo  and  on  to  China.
May Paul's spirit be continually uplifted  by  this  beautiful  country  and
wonderful people as he experiences our heritage. We call on our people,  our
mayors, councillors, communities, and learners in our schools, to  give  him
friendship, protection and  hospitality  on  the  road.  We  thank  him  for
visiting us. Hamba kahle Paul, earth walker, qabane  lendlela  nemithi.  You
are an example of unity in diversity and in practice.

I have no doubt that all members of this House will be unanimous in  support
of this debate and will join in the national celebrations for Heritage  Day.
May I endorse the statements made by the hon member  Cassim,  that  Heritage
Day is for all South  Africans:  swart,  bruin  en  wit  [black,  brown  and
white]. It is for all of us and we call on all our  people  to  participate.
Siyabonga, kakhulu. [We thank you very much.] [Applause.]

Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Mevrou die Speaker, dit  was  goed  om  die  Minister  van
Waterwese te hoor, want bome is 'n belangrike erfenis. Dit was ook  mooi  om
te hoor dat hy uiteindelik een sin in Afrikaans  gepraat  het.  Baie  dankie
daarvoor.

Ek is baie jammer dat ons Minister van Kuns en Kultuur nie  vandag  hier  is
nie. Ek is baie bly dat die agb Brigitte Mabandla vroeër hier was,  maar  ek
sien dat sy nou voet  in  die  wind  geslaan  het.  Ek  wil  ook  graag  die
afvaardiging van SAHRA verwelkom wat gekom  het  om  hierdie  debat  aan  te
hoor.

Te dikwels word erfenis eng beskou as 'n luukse, iets  waaroor  mense  sterk
emosies het, maar waarvan die betekenis  nie  maklik  deur  die  publiek  of
regering in terme van geldwaarde uitgedruk kan  word  nie.  Die  ongelukkige
waarheid is dat indien erfenis bewaar en volhoubaar benut moet word, en  dit
geld uiteraard die natuurerfenis ook, dit wel in  geldterme  uitgedruk  moet
kan word. Ek wil  vandag  konsentreer  op  ons  konkrete  kultuurerfenis  en
spesifiek op die geboue van ons land.

Geboue het in die eerste plek 'n vanselfsprekende, implisiete  waarde,  maar
ook  ander  belangrike  waardes  wat  insluit   argitektoniese,   kulturele,
assosiatiewe  en  historiese  waardes,  asook  opvoedkundige,  estetiese  en
omgewingswaardes. Dus het eiendom 'n veelheid van waardes. Oor die  afgelope
dekades is daar studies gedoen  wat  afdoende  bepaal  dat  hierdie  waardes
hulself manifesteer in ekonomiese waarde waar  eiendoms-  en  erfenisbestuur
reg toegepas word. In New Jersey, Texas, Colorado, Maryland, Noord- en Suid-
Carolina, Kentucky en Virginia is  byvoorbeeld  bevind  dat  eiendomswaardes
van verklaarde historiese geboue en distrikte konsekwent beduidend  vinniger
toeneem in die oorgrote meerderheid gevalle in die mark geheel,  en  in  die
swakste gevalle teen normale markwaarde.

Die Kaapstadse Vennootskap is 'n goeie plaaslike voorbeeld van hoe om  binne
'n kort tydperk duisende rande se beleggings te lok  en  werkgeleenthede  te
skep deur  stedelike  vernuwing,  waarvan  die  restourasie  van  geboue  'n
belangrike komponent is. Nog 'n voorbeeld is die  Kaapstadse  Waterkant  wat
die restourasie en volhoubare benutting van ou  store,  dokke,  werkswinkels
en   kantoorgeboue   behels.   Vandag   is   die   Waterfront   as    enkele
besoekerslokpunt een van die grootste geldmakers in die  land.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, it was good to listen to the  Minister  of
Water Affairs, because trees are an important heritage.  It  was  also  very
nice to hear that he eventually spoke one sentence in Afrikaans.  Thank  you
very much for that.

It is a pity that our Minister of Arts and Culture is not here today.  I  am
very glad that the hon Brigitte Mabandla was here earlier,  but  I  now  see
that she has taken to her heels. I would also  like  to  welcome  the  SAHRA
delegation who came to listen to this debate.

Too often heritage is narrowly regarded as a luxury, something  about  which
people have strong emotions, but of  which  the  meaning  cannot  easily  be
expressed in terms of monetary value by the public or  the  Government.  The
unfortunate  truth  is  that  if  heritage  must  be  conserved   and   used
sustainably, and this includes natural heritage as well, it should  then  be
expressed in monetary terms. Today  I  would  like  to  concentrate  on  our
concrete  cultural  heritage  and  specifically  on  the  buildings  of  our
country.

Buildings, in the first instance, have  an  obviously  implicit  value,  but
also  other  important  values  which   include   architectural,   cultural,
associative and historical values, as well  as  educational,  aesthetic  and
environmental values. Property, therefore, has a multitude of  values.  Over
the past few decades studies were done which  conclusively  determined  that
these  values  manifest  themselves  in  economic   value   where   property
management and heritage management are  applied  properly.  In  New  Jersey,
Texas, Colorado, Maryland, North and South Carolina, Kentucky and  Virginia,
for example, it was found that the property values of historically  declared
buildings and districts consequently considerably increased  faster  in  the
vast majority of cases in  the  market  as  a  whole,  and  in  the  poorest
instances, at normal market value.

The Cape Town Partnership is a good local example of how thousands of  rands
in investments can be attracted  within  a  short  space  of  time  and  job
opportunities  can  be  created  through  urban  renewal,   of   which   the
restoration of buildings is an important component. Another example  is  the
Cape Town Waterfront which comprises the restoration and sustainable use  of
old stores, docks, workshops and office buildings. Today the Waterfront,  as
a single visitors' attraction, is one of the biggest  money  makers  in  the
country.]

Old hotels, such as the Polana in  Maputo,  Raffles  in  Singapore  and  the
Mount Nelson in Cape Town, represent another case in point. Today the  urban
renewal of entire mothballed dockyard precincts in England and  other  parts
generates more income in real terms than the erstwhile  shipping  and  local
manufacturing industries.

Referring to New Jersey as a  case  study,  it  was  found  that  a  million
dollars of historic preservation created five more jobs  than  manufacturing
a million dollars' worth of electronic equipment, 19 more jobs in  producing
a million dollars' worth of  metals,  and  18  more  jobs  than  refining  a
million dollars' worth of chemicals.  Think  also  of  what  this  means  in
direct  and  downstream  savings   on   dealing   with   the   environmental
consequences of dirty industries. The choice  for  South  Africa  should  be
clear: Concentrate on heritage as one of the major drivers of our economy.

Cultural tourism is the fastest growing component of  the  tourist  industry
worldwide. Beautiful scenery exists everywhere but the  uniqueness  inherent
in the built heritage of a  country  is  what  draws  visitors  to  specific
places. Places are identified by their distinct  appearance  and  atmosphere
and therefore retaining a sense of place is crucial to sustainable  cultural
tourism. A recent study  in  the  state  of  Virginia  found  that  historic
preservation tourists spent an average of $423 in  comparison  to  the  $180
per ordinary tourist. Three times as many tourists visit historic  buildings
as visit beaches; four times as many as visit theme parks  -  think  of  the
hideously appellated Ratanga Junction; and 15 times as many  as  visit  golf
courses. Historic preservation visitors stay longer,  visit  twice  as  many
places and spend two and a half times more than other visitors. In  Virginia
cultural tourism is an integral component of that state's  economy  and  not
merely an alternative to  what  is  falsely  perceived  as  economic  growth
manifesting itself in increases in dirty industry.

Dit is die geval wêreldwyd en behoort ook hier so  te  wees.  Maar  daar  is
problematiese aspekte. In die eerste plek weet die staat nie regtig  wat  hy
besit en  waarvan  hy  die  bewaarder  is  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[That is the scenario worldwide and ought also to  be  the  case  here.  But
there are problematic aspects. In the first place, the state does  not  know
what it really owns and of what it is the custodian.]

The state is the biggest property owner in South Africa. All  three  spheres
of  government  own  vast  building  assets.  Lists  are   incomplete.   The
Department of Public Works has a  woefully  underresourced  heritage  assets
subdirectorate  whose  hard-pressed  members  are  doing  sterling  work  to
identify and list the properties owned by national government.  The  listing
of heritage assets by provincial governments, as well as local  governments,
is patchy at best and mostly completely absent. In short, we  have  to  find
out what we have and start restoring  and  redeploying  our  built  heritage
sustainably.

The  SA  Heritage  Resources  Agency   is   pathetically   underfunded   and
underresourced. Legislation and finances are stumbling blocks  as  well.  In
terms of the Heritage Resources Act, provincial governments are  responsible
for the management of  all  national  monuments  in  that  province  through
provincial heritage resource agencies. These agencies,  with  the  exception
of KwaZulu-Natal, do not exist. In the Western Cape a law giving  effect  to
such an agency is in the drafting stage, but  the  terms  of  the  Financial
Management Act have to be met before public entities  may  be  declared.  At
present provincial heritage  management  functions  constitute  an  unfunded
mandate. The SAHRA was able to extend permits for development  in  terms  of
ministerial regulations which expired in April this year. At  present  legal
development of property has frozen and it is costing the country millions.
There are also all kinds of other developments. It is probably also  only  a
matter of time before someone who has invested  in  a  property  subject  to
receiving a permit  for  development  within  a  reasonable  period  sues  a
provincial government for damages. The Kroon judgment in  the  Eastern  Cape
has made it clear that existing protection  stands  but  that  the  previous
regulations were ultra vires. These financial and legal problems need to  be
resolved forthwith. Furthermore, the national White Paper on Heritage  needs
to be amended to bring it in line with the  Constitution.  Until  such  time
there is really no heritage management in this country.

Plaaslike regering is egter die enkele kardinale sondaar  wat  onberekenbare
skade  veroorsaak  en  toelaat  aan  die  land  se  gebouerfenis.  Onbegrip,
visieloosheid en  korttermyngewin  is  die  grondliggende  oorsake  van  die
vernietiging en verontmensliking van historiese stede en  dorpe.  Die  regte
soort beleid en wetgewing ten opsigte van  beplanning  en  ontwikkeling  kom
kort. Voor daar niks oor is van ons ouer  dorpe  en  stede  nie,  moet  daar
dringend werk gemaak word van die onvermoë  en  onwilligheid  van  plaaslike
regerings. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[Local government, however, is the single cardinal sinner which  causes  and
allows incalculable damage to  the  country's  built  heritage.  A  lack  of
understanding, a lack of vision and  short-term  gain  are  the  fundamental
causes for the destruction and dehumanising of historical cities and  towns.
The right type of  policy  and  legislation  with  regard  to  planning  and
development is lacking. Before there is nothing left of our  old  towns  and
cities, we should urgently make work of the inability and  unwillingness  of
our local governments.]

The built heritage of the country is further threatened  by  the  unintended
consequences of some housing legislation and particularly  the  Security  of
Tenure Act. Its latest interpretation by Judge Harmse will  doubtless  cause
further slumlordism and urban decay. South Africa is a  fascinating  country
from every perspective. Let  us  use  all  of  our  assets  to  develop  our
country, our economy and empower our people. [Applause.]

Ms  ANNELIZÉ  VAN  WYK:  Madam  Speaker,  in  celebrating  Heritage  Day  an
opportunity  is  provided  to  South  Africans  to  celebrate   that   which
distinguishes us from other nations. It is also a celebration of what  binds
us together as South Africans.

Fittingly, the Department of Arts and Culture declared Heritage  Month,  the
month in which we celebrate our national symbols  and  institutions.  It  is
these very symbols that define us as a nation. It is these symbols  that  we
should jealously guard over and treasure.

Ours is a rich culture, a culture with different religions, languages,  food
that we eat and historical inheritance. It is this rich diversity that  lies
at the foundation of our strength and potential as a nation.

The SA Constitution, the basis of our  newly  found  freedom,  protects  our
diversity. It has established bodies guarding over the right of  all  to  be
that different being. The very values  that  South  Africa  as  a  sovereign
democratic state was founded on, acknowledge, protect and provide space  for
that diversity to be practised.

The  National  Assembly  is  one  of  the  institutions  identified  by  the
Department of Arts  and  Culture  to  be  celebrated  during  the  month  of
September. We, representing the diverse people of this country, make up  the
NA. We are as diverse as the people that we represent. That is the way  that
it should be. The question, however, is whether we as members of the  NA  in
our workings portray tolerance to that diversity.

Do we create enough room for different opinions, different perspectives  and
different arguments so as to inform those decisions  that  we  take  in  the
interest of the country as a whole and  the  people  as  a  nation?  Are  we
tolerant towards an opinion, an approach or a point of view  different  from
the one we subscribe to? Do we realise that a different opinion  can  inform
our decisions better or do we feel threatened by it? The challenge to us  as
members is how to acknowledge that diversity and  use  it  as  an  important
building block to achieve unity.

As South Africans we should guard  and  protect  our  rights  to  diversity.
However, we cannot allow that very  right  to  be  abused  by  small  groups
within society who threaten our  democracy.  The  revelations  of  the  past
weeks of a right-wing plot to overthrow Government is an example of  such  a
small section of society intolerant of our diversity.  Such  people  pose  a
threat to our unity. They abuse the room created  for  diversity  and  still
believe  that  through  violence  they  can  force  the  majority  of  South
Africans, black and white, to succumb to  their  obsolete  ideas.  As  South
Africans we should unite against those dark forces and give them no room  to
hide from the law.

I am a white Afrikaans-speaking South African. That violent minority  group,
claiming to represent Afrikaans-speaking whites, does not represent  me  and
millions of others like me. [Applause.] No one  political  grouping  can  or
should claim to represent exclusively any part of our nation.  The  majority
of white South Africans are proudly  part  of  the  New  South  Africa.  Our
loyalty lies with our country and all our people. We participate  fully  and
positively as true South Africans.  Nobody,  through  whatever  actions,  is
going to detract us from doing exactly that.

In celebrating Heritage Day South Africans should consciously seek  to  find
out more about each other's culture. Heritage Day  provides  an  opportunity
for South Africans to enrich their own lives,  their  understanding  of  one
another, by creating a day dedicated to our heritage.  Let  us  on  Heritage
Day not only celebrate our own, but let us also learn from one  another  and
celebrate that together with the many things, both tangible  and  not,  that
unify us as a nation.

Heritage Day celebrations lie close to the  heart  of  the  UDM.  They  take
place days before the UDM celebrates  its  fifth  year  of  founding  on  27
September  1997.  The  UDM's  founding  principles,  as  embodied   in   our
constitution, are  based  on  unity  within  our  rich  diversity.  The  UDM
believes that  we  can  address  poverty  and  imbalances  in  our  society,
inspired by our unifying love of our country  and  its  people.  We  believe
that we should set free the creative power  inherent  in  our  diversity  to
ensure quality of life and individual freedom for every citizen towards  our
transformation into a winning nation.

To the UDM, its president and all its members, a  happy  fifth  anniversary.
May we grow from strength to strength. [Applause.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam  Speaker,  I  welcome  pastor  Woodrow  Walker  and  his
delegation from Atlanta. God bless them  in  their  work  in  South  Africa.
[Applause.] I celebrate Heritage Day grateful for the privilege of  being  a
South African and grateful for  my  Christian  heritage.  I  also  celebrate
Heritage Day grateful for the privilege and honour  of  being  a  mother  of
four  wonderful  children.  The  heritage  we  are  passing  on  to   future
generations, however, is to me a very real concern, even though  it  appears
there may be no future generations to receive it.

Fertility  rates  in  the  entire  developed  world  are  now   well   below
replacement levels, and if  current  declines  in  fertility  rates  in  the
developing world continue, the entire world will soon be  below  replacement
fertility level. Contrary to widespread perceptions of  overpopulation,  the
world needs babies and needs them now!

Until  relatively  recently  the  concepts  of  marriage,  family  and  even
children's rights were not commonly linked with international law.  However,
human rights issues have taken centre  stage  at  international  conferences
and international  law  has  become  hostile  to  long-standing  notions  of
marriage, the  natural  family  and  the  rearing  of  children,  presenting
marriage, motherhood, fatherhood and  childhood  as  cultural  and  economic
problems that demand immediate solutions.

The impact on South African law is evident as these new norms  are  used  to
destroy innocent life and  deconstruct  marriage  and  family  in  spite  of
recent studies, which emphasise the critical role of dual parenting as -


  ...  by  far,  the  most  emotionally  stable  and  economically   secure
  arrangement for child-rearing and recognise that nothing  compares  to  a
  solid, stable marriage between their biological parents.

Scientific surveys have found that  cohabiting,  unmarried  women  are  more
likely than married women to  suffer  physical  and  sexual  abuse  and  the
consequences are even more serious for children as -


  ... the most unsafe of all family environments for children  is  that  in
  which the mother is living with someone other than the child's biological
  father.
Prior to the adoption of the Convention on  the  Rights  of  the  Child,  no
legal system in the world granted autonomy rights to children. In fact,  the
world limited children's autonomy in the short  run  in  order  to  maximise
their development of actual autonomy  in  the  long  run.  If  we  want  our
children and our children's children to celebrate Heritage Day in the  years
to come,  we  must  refute  and  resist  the  lies  that  undermine  family,
marriage, motherhood, fatherhood and childhood. We must give  birth  to  our
babies, love them, enjoy them and protect them. They are a gift from God.


  Where are we going, Mommy?
  People dressed in green,
  If they hurt you, Mommy, just scream.
  What's happening, Mommy, I'm starting to cry,
  Mommy come quickly, they're making me die,
  Killing me quickly, pulling me apart,
  Everything in me, even my heart,
  Bye, Mommy, goodbye
  I love you, I do
  Why, Mommy, why ... can't you love me too?

Termination of pregnancy is abortion and it kills babies! [Interjections.]

Yes, God have mercy  on  us.  Hon  Minister,  do  we  desecrate  forests  to
commemorate the over 230 000 babies legally  terminated  in  the  last  five
years? It is interesting that we have sustainable development  summits,  but
the only real action  to  come  out  of  these  summits  is  termination  of
pregnancy, condoms and the promotion of homosexual  lifestyles.  Why  do  we
pretend to concern ourselves about  sustainable  development  when  we  have
partnered with those who are ensuring that there will be no one  to  benefit
- or at least not our children or their children's children?

... Do hon members know, for example, how many people will be  in  Japan  in
the year ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Madam Speaker.  The  Freedom  Charter  says  South  Africa
belongs to all who live in it and by this is meant that South Africa is,  in
essence, a common heritage to all its people.

Ever since the ANC-led government took power in 1994,  it  has  embarked  on
the road to transform our South African society. The  ANC,  as  outlined  in
the Freedom Charter, has sought to  transform  our  society  from  a  racist
South Africa to a nonracial democracy.

Die vraag is: Het ons geslaag? In 'n baie groot mate het ons. 'n Hele  klomp
wetgewing is ingestem in hierdie Raad om ons land na 'n  nie-rassige  bestel
te lei,  soos  byvoorbeeld  die  Grondwet,  wat  een  van  die  omvangrykste
grondwette ter wêreld is; ons vlag met sy ryk  Suid-Afrikaanse  kleure,  wat
eenheid simboliseer;  en  die  land  se  nuwe  landswapen,  wat  eenheid  in
diversiteit aanspreek. Vergelyk dit met die  landswapen  van  die  ou  Suid-
Afrika, wat juis vandag 92 jaar gelede onthul is, en toe juis vir  apartheid
in sy volle glorie gestaan het.

Ons volkslied beeld 'n blik uit ons verlede en gee ook 'n  groot  sprong  na
ons toekoms en so konsentreer die volkslied ook op eenheid en  nasiebou.  As
ons na bogenoemde feite kyk, en ons fokus op vanjaar se tema,  dan  kan  ons
met trots herdenk dat ons erfenis 'n ware en waardige rol kan speel  in  ons
doel  om  eenheid  te  bereik  binne  die  raamwerk  van  ons   verskillende
agtergronde. Ons grootste erfenis is natuurlik die  mense  van  Suid-Afrika.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The question is: Have we succeeded? To a  very  large  degree  we  have.  A
large body of legislation has been adopted  in  this  Chamber  to  lead  our
country  to  a  nonracial  dispensation,   such   as,   for   example,   the
Constitution, which is one of the most comprehensive  constitutions  in  the
world; our flag with  its  rich  South  African  colours,  which  symbolises
unity; and the country's  new  coat  of  arms,  which  addresses  unity  and
diversity. Compare that with the coat of  arms  of  the  old  South  Africa,
which was unveiled today precisely 92 years ago, and then in fact stood  for
apartheid in all its glory.

Our national anthem reflects a glimpse from our past and also takes a  large
leap into our future and in this way the national anthem  also  concentrates
on unity and nation-building. If we look at the  aforementioned  facts,  and
we focus on this year's theme, then we can commemorate with pride  that  our
heritage can play a true and valuable role  in  our  aim  to  achieve  unity
within the framework of our different backgrounds. Naturally,  our  greatest
heritage is the people of South Africa.]

Through all these dark and often brutal periods that we have  gone  through,
some of us knew that  nonracialism  was  the  key  and  that  that  was  the
objective that we all had to strive for. When the time came,  our  country's
great leaders led by the ANC's Nelson Mandela,  Thabo  Mbeki,  Govan  Mbeki,
Walter Sisulu, as well as FW de Klerk, Constand Viljoen ...

... en andere het Suid-Afrika van 'n gewisse, afgryslike ramp gered. En  toe
kom haar mense, Suid-Afrikaners, ons mense, uit alle hoeke van ons  land  en
met 'n volle Suid-Afrikaanse trotsheid het ons 'n erfenis geskep wat  vandag
bekend staan as die Afrika wonderwerk,  waarvan  die  wêreld  nog  lank  sal
praat. Dit was die vryste en  regverdigste  verkiesing  wat  nog  in  Afrika
gesien en beleef is. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[... and others saved South Africa from a certain,  horrific  disaster.  And
then her people came, South Africans, our people, from all  the  corners  of
our country and with full South African pride we created  a  heritage  which
is today known as the African miracle,  which  the  world  will  be  talking
about for a long time to come. It was the most free and  fair  election  yet
seen and experienced in Africa.]

Today  this  Government  has  achieved  all  its   Chapter   9   objectives,
particularly officially recognising the communities and their  languages  in
the Khoisan Council. Extracts from  the  President's  ``I  am  an  African''
speech, relate to this. In his quotes the President reflects on  the  notion
that we know where we are coming from and that we know where we are going.

It was re-emphasised at the recent World Summit on  Sustainable  Development
that our country is the cradle of the human  race.  It  is  also  here  that
birth was given to some of civilisation's most  profound  foundations.  From
the days of the Khoisan  civilisation  and  the  tribal  authorities,  South
Africa is continuing on its path of ubuntu: I am, because you are. Also  the
Gandhian choice of satyagraha, the force of truth, which was  born  here  in
our country and is cherished by the  entire  world.  I  must  thank  comrade
Ramgobin for this background. These cultural  experiences  and  expressions,
born in the crucible of our country's consciousness, are today not only  our
heritage but the heritage of the human  family.  Let  us  be  proud  of  the
different cultures and languages of our country.

Today our former President, Nelson Mandela, son of  this  African  soil,  is
part of that world heritage that makes up the human race. Let  us  celebrate
our freedom through our national  symbols.  Let  us  all  proudly  sing  the
national anthem when we are watching our sporting heroes in the stadiums  of
our country and the world; when we come together and welcome  the  heads  of
state of other countries. Let  us  not  sing  only  the  part  that  we  are
comfortable with, but let us all sing the entire  national  anthem,  because
this anthem makes us proud of who we are. Let us stand tall when  we  salute
our flag, because our flag has become a symbol of strength  and  unity,  not
just in our country but in Africa and the rest  of  the  world.  Let  us  be
proud of our coat of arms, because this reflects our real identity as  South
Africans.

!ke e:/xarra//ke  -  [We  stand  proud  through  our  unity  in  diversity.]
[Applause.]
Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, as ons praat van  ons  erfenis,  dan
praat ons ook onder andere van ons geskiedenis. Daar  is  'n  aanhaling  wat
sê: Die geskiedenis is die bewaarder van die herinneringe van groot dade  en
die getuie van die verlede, die voorbeeld en die leermeester van  die  hede,
die waarskuwing vir die toekoms.

As  ons  Erfenisdag  saam  as  Suid-Afrikaners  wil  vier,  om  eenheid   in
verskeidenheid te bewerkstellig, moet ons ag  slaan  op  hierdie  aanhaling.
Dan moet daar erkenning wees vir elkeen se herinneringe van groot  dade  van
die verlede. Dan moet ek as Afrikaner toegelaat word om myself  te  wees  en
tuis te wees in my land waarin ek leef. Dan moet my taal erken word  en  nie
onderdruk word deur Engels nie.

Die verlede is getuie van  die  stryd  van  Afrikaans,  waarna  daar  in  'n
stadium neerhalend as 'n kombuistaal verwys is, maar wat  opgestaan  het  en
wat met trots gepraat kan word. Laat die geskiedenis  die  leermeester  wees
vir die hede. Laat ons nie dieselfde foute van die verlede herhaal  nie.  As
ons sê ons is ernstig met eenheid  in  verskeidenheid,  moet  ons  dade  ook
daarvan getuig.

Die implementering van die artikel  185-kommissie,  die  Kommissie  vir  die
Bevordering  en  Beskerming  van  die  Regte  van  Kultuur-,  Godsdiens-  en
Taalgemeenskappe, het nou nog nie plaasgevind nie. As  ons  ernstig  is  met
wat ons sê, moet ons onsself  afvra:  Hoekom  nie?  Daar  is  nog  nie  eens
advertensies in die media geplaas sodat  hierdie  kommissie  saamgestel  kan
word nie.

Die geskiedenis is die waarskuwing, ook vir die toekoms. Ons moet  ag  slaan
op die waarskuwingstekens, anders gaan  die  spreekwoord  geld:  Hy  wat  sy
verlede vergeet, sal gedwing word om dit te herleef.  Elkeen  van  ons  moet
toegelaat word om te kan sê: Laat die erwe van  my  vaders  vir  my  kinders
erwe bly.  Dan  sal  daar  eenheid  in  verskeidenheid  in  ons  land  wees.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, when we talk about heritage, we are  also
talking, inter alia, about our history. There is  a  quotation  which  says:
History is the guardian of the memories of great deeds and  the  witness  of
the past, the example and the teacher of the present, the  warning  for  the
future.

If we want to celebrate Heritage Day together as South Africans, to  achieve
unity in diversity, we must pay attention to this quotation. There then  has
to be recognition for each person's memories of great deeds of the  past.  I
as an Afrikaner must then be permitted to be myself and to  be  at  home  in
the country in which I live. My language must then  be  recognised  and  not
oppressed by English.

The past is a witness to the struggle of Afrikaans, which was at  one  stage
disparagingly referred to as a kitchen  language,  but  which  rose  up  and
which can be spoken with pride. Let history be the teacher for the  present.
Let us not repeat the same mistakes of the past. If we say  we  are  serious
about unity in diversity, our deeds must also testify to this.

The implementation of the section 185 commission,  the  Commission  for  the
Promotion  and  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  Cultural,   Religious   and
Linguistic Communities, has not yet taken place. If  we  are  serious  about
what we are saying we must ask ourselves why not?  Advertisements  have  not
yet  even  been  placed  in  the  media  so  that  this  commission  can  be
constituted.

History is the warning, also for the future. We must pay  attention  to  the
warning signs, otherwise the idiom will apply: Those  who  forget  the  past
are doomed to repeat it. Each one of us must be  permitted  to  be  able  to
say: May the heritage they gave us for our children yet be. Then there  will
be unity in diversity in our country.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, hon members, there is one thing most  people
agree on, and that is that nation-building has not  been  achieved  yet.  To
achieve this we have to  tread  with  great  circumspection  in  celebrating
occasions like Heritage Day. Nation-building  is  not  an  event,  it  is  a
process that has to evolve and be nurtured to unfold into what is  envisaged
in our interim Constitution of 1993, namely:


  ... a need to create a new order in which  all  South  Africans  will  be
  entitled to a  common  South  African  citizenship  in  a  sovereign  and
  democratic constitutional state in which there is  equality  between  men
  and women and people of all races so that all citizens shall be  able  to
  enjoy and exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms.

It cannot happen overnight and laggards to change  should  not  be  rebuked,
because this may scare and alienate them for much longer. Occasions such  as
Heritage Day call for what the  interim  Constitution  calls  a  ``need  for
understanding,  not  vengeance  and  a  need  for  ubuntu,   but   not   for
victimisation''. The other stakeholders should be invited to  the  planning,
then the preparations and should eventually participate  in  the  programmes
of Heritage Day itself.

This bottom-up approach is consultative and involves other  people,  whereas
the current practice of celebrating the day  is  top-down:  Hence  very  few
people buy into it. For as long as the ruling party treats the  celebrations
of national public days as their preserve, apathy among  other  people  will
manifest itself. There has to be sensitivity in celebrating  occasions  like
this, as we are in a process of making a legacy for posterity. Our  children
should not find that we  have  left  them  a  heritage  of  domination  over
others, or being dominated by others. They should  not  find  that  have  we
left them a heritage of delighting in  excluding  and  marginalising  others
and, conversely, we should leave our children a heritage of mutual  respect,
mutual understanding, tolerance and the undying desire to serve humanity.

Heritage Day celebrations should serve as a bond among our  people.  Imagine
if we are to celebrate the heritage of our forebears with the  programme  of
the day making provision for addresses in snippets of  all  eleven  official
languages.  Imagine  if  we  were  to  attend  occasions   and   listen   to
boeremusiek,  the  Sesotho  moqoqopelo,  the  Venda  ndomba  and  all  other
cultural dances. The occasion can be colourful and all  could  look  forward
to the day the following year. On Heritage Day we should  follow  the  great
law of culture, which is to let each one become all that he was  created  to
be.

During  Heritage  Day  celebrations  people  should  entertain   themselves,
entertain guests and entertain ideas.  Finally,  may  we  on  Heritage  Day,
wherever we shall be gathered, chant our heritage  of  unity,  the  national
anthem,  with  proper  decorum  and  without  any  aid  from   some   choir.
[Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the subject of our debate today  needs  to  be
affirmed by all who call themselves Africans - that is,  those  who  believe
that Africa is their home, those who have no other  place  they  call  home,
those who have an unshaken sense of belonging  and  those  who  just  cannot
resist the sweet smell of the soil of their country.

This definition does not refer to the colour of a person, which is  a  great
irrelevance and an accident of one's birth. Thanks go to God, who has  given
us this great heritage of a beautiful country with clear blue skies  by  day
and a symphony of stars by night, a country that has no volcanoes  and  very
few earth tremors, a country that is multicultural  and  multilingual,  with
human gifts of all varieties.

And yet, this is the  country  that  was  nearly  reduced  to  rubble  or  a
bloodbath through human bigotry and possibly a sense of greed. The ideal  of
freedom nearly eluded us. Many sacrificed and some  resisted,  while  others
even remained indifferent. However, we are  all  here,  together  under  the
canopy of our magnificent sky. God  has  given  us  another  opportunity  to
celebrate our common nationhood, our common creatureliness.

The freedom we now enjoy belongs to us all. No single  group  or  party  can
rightly claim this Parliament or Robben Island, Soweto  '76  or  Sharpeville
'60, or the Majuba Hills of the Anglo-Boer War of the 1880s and 1890s to  be
their own. These were our individual, group or collective mistakes or sins.

God forbid that we should want to live in the past  or  want  to  build  our
future and that of our children on the dustheap of our past, reminiscent  of
the dusty valleys of Afghanistan. At best, we should  learn  from  the  past
and bravely face the challenges that lie ahead of us.

This nation has made mistakes and  blunders,  but  it  has  also  seen  some
wonderful achievements such as, for example, the historic Rustenburg  Church
Conference; the Codesa negotiations at Kempton Park; the  Peace  Conference,
of which I hope we can make a film; the Peace Accord; the  Prayer  Rally  at
Kings Park, Durban; the joint monitoring of the KwaZulu-Natal election;  the
IFP-ANC Peace Initiative at  Kempton  Park;  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation
Commission; the South African Constitution;  the  Human  Rights  Commission;
our  first  democratic  election;  that  historic  induction  of  our  first
democratic President, with the whole world in attendance; and,  lately,  the
World Summit on Racism, the WSSD and the Non-Aligned Movement Conference.

The only critical rejoinder  is  that  we  must  not  allow  these  national
historic landmarks to degenerate into the colonial trophies of one group  or
party. We must  grow.  We  are  now  a  nation.  Under  God,  we  will  face
challenges like the African Union and world peace. We will play  our  unique
part in building a country and a world of peace, under  God,  as  we  repeat
the inspired words of our national anthem:


  Morena boloka setjaba sa heso [God bless our nation]
  Woza Moya, woza Moya [Come Spirit, come Spirit]
  Usisikelele. [And bless us.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, we live on the  planet  Earth,  which  is
under tremendous pressure. What we know of this planet of ours  is  that  it
has changed over the past millennia and that  each  time  everybody  had  to
adapt to the new changes. Now it is the same, in that we have to learn  from
our experience. This is what we have inherited from the past. At the  moment
our planet is under tremendous pressure and if we want to continue with  our
other activities, we should take note of how our  decisions  will  influence
future life on this planet.

As ek na Suid-Afrika kyk, wonder ek soms wat het ons van die verlede  geërf.
Dan kom 'n magdom gedagtes by my op. Elke individu  kan  seker  sy  eie  lys
opstel oor die ekonomie, oor sy taal en kultuur, oor voorregte,  benadeling,
oor die politiek en  oor  sport,  wat  ook  al.  Elkeen  se  herinnering  en
ervaring is dus sy erfdeel en dit maak  hom  wat  hy  is.  Juis  in  hierdie
verskeidenheid  van  erfenisse  en  die  diversiteit  van  ondervinding   en
ervaring in een land se mense lê die wonder en ook die uitdaging  vir  Suid-
Afrika.

As ons dié verskille negatief ervaar, gaan ons  hierdie  wonder  nie  verder
uitbou nie. Ons sal ook nie samewerking skep nie. Dit sal ons  nie  help  om
nie weer die foute van die verlede te herhaal nie.  As  ons  afwyk  van  die
begrip van om vir mekaar ruimte te skep, sal ons terugval in die moeras  van
gister, waar elke kind  van  Suid-Afrika  sy  erfdeel  opeis.  Dan  sal  dié
erfdeel, soos die een van die verlore seun in die Bybelse  geskiedenis,  gou
in korttermyn klatergoud verval en tot Suid-Afrika se nadeel wees.

Elkeen van ons is die produk van gister se omstandighede. Gaan ons voort  om
elkeen vir sy eie eensydige oortuigings te baklei, soos in die  verlede,  of
gaan ons met nuwe moed die toekoms in Suid-Afrika tegemoet wat ons  aan  die
einde van die vorige eeu vir onsself geskep het? Dit was op daardie  oomblik
in Suid-Afrika se geskiedenis toe die mense van ons land, oor hul  verskille
heen, 'n geleentheid tot samewerking geskep en benut het.

In die eerste paar jare het ons goed gebou op die eenheid  van  diversiteit,
maar in die laaste paar jaar sien ek  hoe  ons  al  hoe  meer  wegbeweeg  en
mekaar minder verstaan, en dat daar minder verdraagsaamheid is. Ek  sien  in
die laaste tyd helaas dat die ou gewoontes terugkeer en so  die  nuutgevonde
erfenis van vryheid en demokrasie toenemend bedreig. Ons het weer begin  val
in die slaggate  van  gister  se  diskriminasie  en  vooroordele.  Ons  loop
gereeld vas in die landmyne van wraak, vergelding en onverdraagsaamheid  wat
mense in groepe se belange negeer.

Dit is baie jammer, want dit kan so anders wees. Mag  die  gesprek  wat  ons
vandag hier voer, bydra om die positiewe nasiebou waarna ons strewe weer  op
die spoor te plaas. Gister is verby -  dit  is  geskiedenis.  Ons  moet  die
toekoms skrywe en dit reg skrywe. Dit is wat die  toekoms  van  ons  verwag.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[When I look at South Africa, I sometimes  wonder  what  we  have  inherited
from the past. Then a multitude of thoughts come  to  me.  Every  individual
could probably compile his own list on the  economy,  on  his  language  and
culture,  on  privileges,  prejudice,  on  politics  and  sport,   whatever.
Everyone's memory and  experience  are  therefore  his  heritage,  and  that
determines who he is. It is precisely in this diversity of heritage and  the
diversity of experience in one country's people that the wonder of and  also
the challenge for South Africa lie.

If we experience these differences negatively,  we  shall  not  be  able  to
build upon this wonder any further, nor  will  we  be  able  to  create  co-
operation. It will not help us to repeat the mistakes of  the  past.  If  we
deviate from the principle of making room for  one  another,  we  will  fall
back into the quagmire of  yesterday,  with  every  child  of  South  Africa
claiming his heritage. Then this heritage  will,  as  in  the  case  of  the
prodigal son in biblical history, soon be reduced to  tinsel  in  the  short
term and be to South Africa's detriment.

Every one of us is the product of yesterday's circumstances. Are all  of  us
going to continue to fight for our own unilateral  convictions,  as  in  the
past, or are we going to face the future in South Africa, the  South  Africa
that we created for ourselves at the end  of  the  last  century,  with  new
courage. It was at that point in  the  history  of  South  Africa  that  the
people  of  our  country,  regardless  of  their  differences,  created  and
utilised an opportunity for co-operation.

During the first few years we built soundly upon  the  unity  of  diversity,
but over the past few years I  have  seen  us  moving  increasingly  further
apart and understanding one another less, and that there is less  tolerance.
Unfortunately I have seen recently that the old habits are  returning,  thus
posing an increasing  threat  to  the  new-found  heritage  of  freedom  and
democracy. We  have  started  falling  into  the  pot-holes  of  yesterday's
discrimination and prejudices again. We frequently encounter  the  landmines
of vengeance, retribution and intolerance, which  negate  the  interests  of
groups of people.

This is a pity, because it could be so different. May  our  discussion  here
today contribute toward getting back on track the  positive  nation-building
to which we aspire. Yesterday is past - it is history.  We  must  write  the
future, and write it correctly. That is what the future expects of us.]

Mrs M L NGWENYA: Madam Speaker and hon members, it  is  right  that  we  are
celebrating a day that recognises what  we  South  Africans  share.  We  are
truly a diverse nation and we are building a democratic society day by  day,
which has as its foundation tolerance and  respect  for  diversity.  Let  us
look at all of our traditions and customs with  eyes  and  senses  that  are
open to learning the best way we can.

[Legofsi.] (Translation of Pedi paragraphs follows)

[This is the day to rejoice and celebrate the remembrance  of  our  heritage
whereby our children and grandchildren will know the importance of the  food
and drinks that we as parents were previously disadvantaged to learn about.
Are you aware that when we grew up we never went hungry? We  ate  and  threw
away. Are you aware that we grew  up  honouring  and  respecting  nature?  I
mean, everything had its own time. For example, there  were  times  for  the
cultivation of grass, for the roofing of our homes,  for  cultivating  cane,
for sweeping grass, etc.

The Chief ordered the indunas to give  orders  of  the  cultivation  of  the
grass, and then people were granted permission to go and cultivate grass.

This is the reason why the huts in the rural areas look  so  beautiful  with
grass roofing. When harvest time arrives, for instance  for  fruit  such  as
marula fruit, women will wake up early in the morning to go and pick  marula
fruit and gather  it  into  their  homes,  and  then  brew  wine  for  their
husbands. Once the wine is ready, all the  old  men  will  come  with  their
wives and gather to drink the marula wine. The old men would then prefer  to
eat porridge and chicken with green chillies.

Our mothers prepared porridge for their children made out  of  marula  while
it was still fine. This is called kgabolane.  They  also  had  marula  as  a
drink in order to detox for good health. Marula is a  medicine  to  generate
birth. In oder to have peace at home child bearing is important.

During the period when all natural fruit were ripe, fruit  such  as  mabilo,
mahlatswa, mmupudu, ditoro, ditshidi, dithetlwa and dikwele, to mention  but
a few, we girls never cooked during that period;  we  only  cooked  for  our
parents. We survived on natural fruit. We were as healthy as well  cared-for
animals that usually go for cleansing.

Things took a turn for the worse when the  betterment  scheme  of  1949  was
introduced. I used to call it  the  ``worsement  scheme''  because  we  were
deprived of our food; all of a sudden we were not allowed to climb  our  own
natural mountains. All the  mountains  were  delimitated  by  the  apartheid
government. When the Chief said something he  was  arrested  and  his  tribe
were threatened to keep quiet. Poverty gripped us, hunger came  in,  and  we
were enslaved in our own land of origin.

We have traditional food which we call  marotse,  maraka,  ditloo,  dinyebu,
lewa, ditlhodi, lekokoro and mokhusa, to mention but a few. [Applause.]  Our
food was very nutritious. We used to cook porridge with pumpkin and call  it
kgodu or thopi. We used to crush  pumpkin  and  watermelon  seeds  and  cook
porridge which is called morobolo, in the Sekhukhuni language it  is  called
semphoriane, which is African pudding in English. We  used  to  eat  pumpkin
seeds with porridge when we were tired of milk and meat. There used to be  a
lot of milk, we did not put it in the fridge but used to  give  it  to  pigs
when it turned bad. [Applause.]

There were no orphans or widowers because our fathers used to tell us to  go
to plough in so-and-so's field in the mornings. And we would take seeds  and
go there. Our mothers had no say in that. That was to  prevent  anyone  from
going hungry, which was the main thing in the community, and we  still  need
that even today.

There used to be a big day which was called re buile masemong [we  are  back
form the  fields]  after  reaping.  On  that  day  our  mothers  would  cook
different kinds of food, show their ability to cook  traditional  food,  and
we would go to the kraal to watch, to eat and to rejoice. Our  fathers  used
to drink marula beer - not the kind that is sold these days.

We girls used to wear our  traditional  clothes  and  go  to  sing  for  our
parents; that is why there were no spinsters. [Applause.]  Girls  would  get
married, because that is where they were seen and their parents  would  take
pride in them. [Applause.]

When it comes to valuing trees, we grew up knowing that they  are  used  for
firewood. Only dry trees were cut, and not soft trees. That is  why  we  did
not carry axes to go and fetch wood. We  used  to  make  tools  for  cutting
trees only. We used to respect trees as much as we respected  ourselves.  We
did not cut the other trees which our  parents  told  us  not  to  cut,  for
example mmilo, moshidi and others. Even though we did not  know  the  reason
for it, because we had respect we used to respect our parents. We could  not
cut fruit trees for fear of  cutting  fruit-bearing  branches,  which  would
have meant that we could not have the fruit the following year.

In conclusion, we  should  be  given  an  opportunity  to  go  back  to  our
traditional ways so that our children can enjoy  a  life  free  of  diseases
that we see today. Let us love our traditions.  It  is  not  true  that  our
traditional lives are of a lower class. We must uplift our tradition and  be
proud of it because it has made us what we are today. We are the  Lydias  of
high class. We are not afraid of anything. Thank you.]

S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. May I at this  point  take  the
opportunity to thank all the  hon  MPs  that  phoned  me  and  sent  me  SMS
messages and flowers, fruit and sweets during my  illness.  I  had  a  major
operation of a total knee replacement and my  heritage  was  a  plastic  and
metal heritage of the knee. Thank you very much all of  you  for  your  kind
thoughts and prayers. I am back now and I am on the  route  of  exposing  my
loud voice again.

As I did last year, I shall  reiterate  the  rich  heritage  that  we  South
Africans encapsulate. Its content marks the beginning  of  our  people,  our
nation, all around us. Everything we see, all that exists  has  a  story  of
its origin, beginning and inheritance - a heritage that  the  MF  celebrates
with all South Africa.

Last year we took to commemorating our national emblems and  this  year  the
theme is to celebrate our  national  symbols  and  institutions.  Our  flag,
national bird, national fish,  national  flower,  anthem,  national  animal,
coat of arms and national tree all symbolise our heritage. It  is  the  duty
of all South Africans to preserve these national symbols in respect  of  our
heritage.

The struggle of our people forms a part of this heritage too, as blood  that
seeped into our soil for hundreds of  years.  Today  stand  erected  museums
that tell the story of our people. This allows our people to be reminded  of
their  heritage.  We  have  fought  together  and  we  have  entered  a  new
generation that sees us as one people,  not  divided  by  race,  culture  or
creed. We are one.

The MF expresses the need to maintain this unity, the need  to  instil  this
unity from the callow ages of our youth to the  reformation  in  thought  of
our elderly. The MF calls upon all not to look back and attempt the  tactics
of the past regime to divide our society. Look forward to a better  tomorrow
as one. Let us celebrate our  heritage  that,  though  diverse  in  content,
together formulates  a  masterpiece.  Our  main  heritage  is  our  beloved,
beautiful South Africa.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy Speaker, with the slogan ``Unity in  Diversity''  we
are touching the key to success or failure  in  South  Africa.  It  is  this
concept that will determine in the long run  whether  South  Africa  is  and
will really be  the  miracle  so  often  spoken  about.  But  there  is  one
condition; unity in diversity is only  the  one  side  of  the  coin.  South
Africans, despite their different cultures, languages and beliefs  must  act
together and stand together as a country.  They  must  address  together  in
unity the enormous problems and challenges facing all  of  us  together.  To
that goal the AEB is fully committed.

But, the flip side of the coin is diversity in unity; fully recognising  and
fully accommodating our rich diversity and celebrating  this  diversity  not
as a threat, but as an asset, as the oxygen for security,  as  the  gift  of
belonging. Therefore, I am going to switch  to  overdrive,  meaning  I  will
address you further in my mother tongue.

Die sleutel tot sukses van die geheel is afhanklik van die  respek  vir  die
dele. Die eenheid in die leuse  op  die  landswapen  is  afhanklik  van  die
respek vir die verskeidenheid, wat ook daarin vervat is.  Die  boustene  vir
'n Suid-Afrika waarin al sy kinders veilig en geborge kan wees,  lê  in  die
eerbied vir dít wat vir elke gemeenskap kosbaar  is  as  die  erwe  van  ons
vaad're.

In dié opsig is ek bevrees dat ons dikwels lippediens  bewys  aan  die  ryke
kaleidoskoop  van  die  erfenis  van  al  ons  mense.  Hier  is  net  enkele
voorbeelde. Die lank beloofde artikel 185-wet het uiteindelik  ná  ses  jaar
die lig gesien. Gaan ons nog ses jaar wag vir  die  implementering  daarvan?
Die gedagte was dan juis dat die kommissie vir die  regte  van  gemeenskappe
op Erfenisdag 2002 die lig sou sien. Die voortdurende afkraak  van  taal  as
synde 'n struikelblok vir toelating tot  ons  tersiêre  inrigtings  voorspel
niks goeds vir die respek vir die tale van ons land nie.  Nog  'n  voorbeeld
is die samesmelting van universiteite van bo af, rondgeskuif soos pionne  op
'n skaakbord, sonder inagneming van die taal,  etos  en  karakter  van  elke
inrigting. Vat maar net 'n raai wie is die skaakmeester.

Daar  was  'n  blitzkrieg   van   ondeurdagte   naamsveranderinge   in   die
Limpopoprovinsie. Dit is asof die totale geskiedenis van die  deel  van  die
bevolking waaraan ek behoort met 'n enkele pennestreep uitgewis  moet  word.
Dit is ironies dat net die dorp wat na die duiwel vernoem  is  sy  naam  kon
behou. Daar is skoolleerplanne waarin die geskiedenis herskryf word  volgens
een resep, waarin elke unieke waardesisteem op die altaar van die nuwe  orde
geoffer word. Dit is alles dinge wat my as  lojale,  toegewyde,  patriotiese
Suid-Afrikaner dikwels tog laat vra: Hoort ek regtig nog hier?

Die beskerming van die ryke verskeidenheid van ons veelgefasetteerfenis  mag
nie in museums opgesluit lê om nou en dan bekyk te word nie. Dit  moet  leef
in ons harte, in ons strate, elke dag. (Translation of Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The key to the success of the whole is dependent on  the  respect  for  its
parts. The unity referred to in the slogan of our coat of  arms  depends  on
the respect for the diversity, which is also contained in it.  The  building
blocks for a South Africa in which all its children can be safe  and  secure
lie in respect for what is valuable in each community  as  the  legacy  from
their forefathers.

In this respect,  I  fear  that  we  often  pay  lip  service  to  the  rich
kaleidoscope of the heritage  of  all  our  people.  Here  are  just  a  few
examples. The long promised section 185 legislation has eventually seen  the
light after six years. Will we have  to  wait  another  six  years  for  its
implementation? The idea was precisely for the Commission for the Rights  of
Communities  to  be  established  on  Heritage  Day  2002.   The   continual
discrediting  of  language  as  an  obstacle  to   admission   to   tertiary
institutions does not bode  well  for  respect  for  the  languages  of  our
country. Another example is the  top-down  merging  of  universities,  moved
around like pawns on a chessboard, without consideration for  the  language,
ethos and character of each institution.  Just  take  a  guess  at  who  the
chessmaster is.

There was a  blitzkrieg  of  ill-considered  name  changes  in  the  Limpopo
province. It is as though the entire history of that part of the  population
that I belong to has to completely be wiped out by the single  stroke  of  a
pen. It is ironic that only the town that was named after  the  devil  could
retain its name. There are school syllabi in which the history is  rewritten
according to one recipe, in which each unique value system is sacrificed  on
the altar of the new order. These are all things that often make me  ask  as
a loyal, committed, patriotic South African: Do I really still belong here?

The protection of the rich diversity of our multifaceted heritage cannot  be
locked away in a museum to be viewed  occasionally.  It  must  live  in  our
hearts, in our streets, every day.]

Let us not celebrate  our  diversity  once  a  year  on  Heritage  Day,  but
throughout the year in  our  daily  conduct,  in  our  legislation,  in  our
respect for what is precious to every community, and maybe  the  miracle  of
South Africa will become a sustainable reality for all its peoples.

Mr C M LOWE:  Madam  Speaker,  shortly  before  he  died,  French  President
Francois Mitterand was asked how he thought history would  judge  him.  ``It
all depends on who is writing it'', he replied. And  a  few  years  earlier,
when he stood at this very podium as the first  foreign  head  of  state  to
address our democratic Parliament, he spoke  passionately  of  the  need  to
speak the truth.

As we celebrate our South African heritage and acknowledge the past, let  us
reflect on Mitterand's wise observations and  ensure  that  our  history  is
written in the name of  all  South  Africans  and  that  our  past,  however
terrible and traumatic, human and heroic, is an  inclusive  account  of  our
story as a nation and our place in the world.

So what is our story? Well it is certainly not  the  skewed  history  I  was
taught up to  matric  -  where  ``die  donderse  Engelse''  and  the  ``Zulu
heathens'' were the perennial baddies - any more than the sanitised  records
of life in the ANC camps, devoid of accounts of human rights  abuse  and  of
torture.

And while it is true that there  was  a  liberal  slide  away  in  the  late
seventies and the eighties, as so vividly portrayed by Jill Wentzel  in  her
book, it is just as true that for every slide away, other liberals  remained
committed to  the  cause  and  continued  the  struggle  for  democracy  and
freedom. While it is  a  fact  that  the  TRC  process  uncovered  countless
chilling incidents of gross human rights abuses committed by  the  apartheid
state, it is just as true that more than just a few atrocities were  carried
out by those on the side of the liberation struggle.

In his book Last Days in Cloud Cuckooland,  a  fascinating  account  of  the
final gasps of white power on the continent, from the flight of the  Belgian
refugees from the Congo in 1960 to  the  first  years  of  Nelson  Mandela's
presidency, Graham Boyton shows the complexity and ambiguity of the role  of
the whites in Africa, observing that they were never a unified gang of cold-
hearted supremacists any more than the blacks in Africa have been a  saintly
group of idealists and altruists.

Such is the reality of our heritage, far more complex  and  many  shades  of
grey rather than the starkness and simplicity of black and white. But it  is
a reality that we must accept and a challenge we must grasp  if  we  are  to
become a winning nation. For how can we ever have a future  if  we  fail  to
honestly acknowledge our collective past?

Just as the rock art on our new coat of arms fosters a sense of dignity  and
nationhood which, in the words of President Mbeki, evokes our distant  past,
our living present and our future, so our heritage as  a  people  must  tell
the entire story and include all the players.

The point is this, when the  tributes  and  edifices  of  Freedom  Park  are
unveiled in 2004 will  they  reflect  all  of  our  struggles,  all  of  our
histories and all  of  our  heritages,  or  will  they  simply  portray  one
struggle and acknowledge individuals therein based on  the  political  cause
that they supported?

Steve Biko is rightly praised for the  inclusiveness  of  his  struggle  for
black consciousness and ultimately South African consciousness. We too  must
become more inclusive in our consciousness as a nation. We cannot live in  a
country of two peoples, divided forever by where our forefathers came  from,
what languages we speak, what religions we practise  and  what  ideology  we
support.

Why does the Apartheid  Museum  in  Johannesburg  pay  lip  service  to  the
monumental work of Helen Suzman? Why is the  courageous  role  of  the  late
Molly Blackburn not fully told and when will we read  of  the  heroic  legal
defence work of the late Harry Pitman? We are all one,  and  I,  along  with
every one of the hon members, choose to be here, in the  country  that  gave
us birth and which we all love, as much of  an  African  as  the  President.
That story needs to be told as well. [Applause.]

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Madam Speaker, South Africa's Heritage Day,  24  September,
falls within the heritage month, where  the  emphasis  is  on  our  national
flag, coat of arms, national anthem, national orders and National  Assembly,
as part of the theme of celebrating our national symbols  and  institutions.
It is my  understanding  that  this  theme  was  chosen  to  popularise  our
national symbols and to inform the  public  of  their  significant  meaning.
Chief  amongst  these  meanings  would  have  to  be  national   unity   and
reconciliation.

The IFP believes that our national symbols must build  bridges  between  the
past and the future of this great country.  South  Africa  consist  of  many
rich diverse cultures and traditions. In the past this  diversity  was  used
to divide us and to keep us apart, but the new South Africa demands that  we
embrace our diversity in order to unite us, not to unite in the  sense  that
we must forgo our individuality or individual  cultures  and  traditions  in
the interest of one national identity, but unite in the sense that  we  must
accept and respect  one  another  and  show  proper  respect  for  different
cultures.

On 24 September various activities will take place around  South  Africa  to
celebrate Heritage Day. It is my sincere hope that these activities will  be
used as an opportunity for South Africans to come together and to  celebrate
our diversity by uniting across boundaries and to embrace  our  new  nation.
The IFP believes that while all people of South Africa must play a  role  on
Heritage Day to celebrate our unity in diversity, the contributions  of  the
youth of our country should be singled  out.  It  is  the  youth  that  will
provide the leadership of tomorrow and  it  is  the  youth  that  must  take
forward the great strides we have  made  in  uniting  and  reconciling  past
differences and divisions. This  process  of  fostering  unity  and  respect
across cultural lines is by no means at an  end  and  should,  in  fact,  be
deepened and strengthened by the actions of the youth.

The leader of the IFP, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi MP, highlighted the  role
of youth at a recent IFP Youth Brigade conference, when  he  warned  against
the potential development of totalitarianism in South Africa  and  where  he
stated:


  It will be the task of a new generation to strengthen civil  society  and
  to ensure that enough power is spread  to  the  building  blocks  of  our
  society,  its  business,  its  universities   and   its   nongovernmental
  institutions, to ensure that no single source of power may  ever  control
  our country, its free thinking and its plural expression of its will.

To this I will respectfully add that the youth has a major role to  play  in
our continuing development as a country of many riches and diverse  cultures
and traditions; a country in which diversity is respected  and  honoured  to
such an extent that unity is created and maintained  across  what  may  have
seemed insurmountable barriers just a few years ago. I also  call  upon  all
young people in South Africa, black, white, Indian and coloured, to be  part
of these celebrations, because they are not meant for one cultural  or  race
group. It is meant for all South Africans, so that we bridge the  gaps  that
were created by apartheid. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  ARTS,  CULTURE,  SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Madam
Speaker, the hon  members  who  have  spoken  here  today  all  urge  us  to
celebrate our heritage together as  South  Africans  and  achieve  unity  in
diversity.

I want to share with this House an extract of our acclaimed poet,  a  former
member of this House, Dr Mongane Wally Serote's poem Come and Hope  With  Me
and this is what it says:


  The seed of hope is buried deep
  it lies in the eye and ear
  in the sullen and silent face
  it lies deep in time
  it awaits you
  with large and fat and tall stories
  it awaits you to climb the steep and slope
  this hope awaits you to hope
  come and hope
  with me.
I believe that this poem speaks of the wonderful future  we  want  to  carve
for our children despite the arduous journey. We speak with  a  clear  voice
about our painful past and we say, never again.

Today we stand together as brothers and  sisters  having  woven  together  a
colourful tapestry of our strengths; for example, our resilience,  tenacity,
resoluteness, forgiveness and care for each other and our  determination  to
build a democratic, nonracial and nonsexist society.  The  whole  world  has
seen it and this  tapestry  has  become  the  tallest  symbol  of  hope  for
countries at war with each other and with themselves. Our  stories  and  our
songs are known the world over.

We need to celebrate not only what we have gone through since 1994 and  that
we emerged victorious  today.  We  have  a  responsibility  to  reclaim  the
tangible and intangible threads of our shared colourful  past  and  together
constantly to weave the future we dream of.

This month all Government departments, civil society, business  parastatals,
schools and colleges are making  plans  for  celebrating  heritage  day  and
raising awareness about its  importance.  Let  us  make  this  a  successful
affirmation of our South Africanness. The national event of Heritage Day  is
taking place at Mary Fitzgerald Square in  Johannesburg,  on  24  September.
All provinces will also be holding celebrations within this year's theme  of
national symbols on our Heritage Day. There will be a lot of activities  for
young and old.

This year's theme for Heritage Day has been chosen to celebrate the  symbols
that define us, the symbols which tell the world who we  are  and  where  we
come from - our flag,  our  national  anthem,  our  coat  of  arms  and  our
national institutions. We have  united  under  popular  events  through  our
symbols. We have volunteered to have our flag painted  even  on  our  faces.
These symbols have become us. One is confident that  our  coat  of  arms  is
indeed going to enjoy the same affection as the flag does. Heritage  Day  is
also an  important  day  to  educate  the  people  about  our  value  system
emanating from our Constitution.

At the very core of our being as  South  Africans  reverberates  an  amazing
sense of responsibility for this beautiful country and all it embodies.  Our
heritage cannot be simply  defined  as  cultural  or  natural,  because  our
biophysical environment shapes us and  we  shape  it.  We  have  shaped  our
history and  it  has  also  shaped  us.  Through  this  close  knit  web  of
interaction has emerged what the global world can affectionately call  South
African.

Our future is intact in our  heritage.  St  Lucia  stands  as  an  important
heritage site not only because of its biodiversity, but also because of  the
indigenous knowledge associated with the  site  symbolised  by  the  fishing
kraals of Sodwana. The coelacanth, termed  ``extinct'',  resurfaced  telling
the world that  our  heritage  is,  indeed,  intact.  The  great  invincible
uKhahlamba, the Drakensberg mountains, have from times  afar  sheltered  our
priceless  artistic  masterpieces  -  our  rock  paintings.  Our  cradle  of
humankind at Sterkfontein has told the world time and again that  the  first
human umbilical cord was buried in our part of the world.

Our artistic prowess and finesse  cannot  be  disputed  when  one  sees  the
Mapungubwe rhino. When the world approved  some  of  these  sites  as  world
class, it was indeed an affirmation of the  exceptional  wealth  that  these
majestic landscapes hold. We all have a challenge to  make  these  treasures
enrich our people.

One of the milestones we reached in reclaiming our dignity  was  indeed  the
burial of Sarah Bartman. Once more I thank everyone,  including  the  people
of Khoi-San descent who collectively made this event a successful one.

We saw through the World Summit how we can  achieve  the  best  if  we  push
ourselves to the extreme  of  our  capabilities.  We  opened  the  doors  of
creativity to the world by showcasing beautiful things. Our  artwork,  which
ultimately displayed the extravagance  and  daring  nature  of  our  spirit,
creativity and daringness to do something  different,  amazed  our  visitors
and ourselves.

We are constantly discovering who we are. We  splashed  our  colour  through
our beadwork and cloths, our carvings, grasses, song and  dance.  We  showed
our visitors that our local  resources  made  music.  It  is  not  only  the
artists and students who put  up  the  exhibition  together  who  benefited.
Ubuntu Village massaged our souls. In money terms - of course, the  crafters
made a coin. I can say here today that crafters themselves made close to  R2
million in those ten days.

This, gives us confidence that we are  on  the  right  path  to  sustainable
development. We were able to usher our crafts, which  have  been  downgraded
and given peripheral status, into the centre of the stage.

We made a case for  our  heritage  of  indigenous  knowledge  at  the  World
Summit. Discussions on indigenous knowledge systems were very  vibrant;  and
I agree with MmaLydia that, in fact, we have  reached  indigenous  knowledge
in this country.

What stood out in the debates was that we need to acknowledge  the  positive
role that our heritage can play in sustainable development. The  debates  on
indigenous knowledge systems touched on the issues of poverty, in  the  face
of loads of wisdom packaged away having been termed inferior  and  backward,
as MmaLydia was saying.

Our indigenous technologies, knowledge of plants, the  significance  of  our
crafts and the complex mathematical understandings  in  them  give  us  more
energy to explore ways of utilising them in modern times.  And  I  do  agree
with hon Anna Van Wyk when she says that it is time that we became aware  of
the importance of heritage even in monetary terms.

The challenge to make tangible that of  our  heritage  which  is  intangible
such as our freedom, will be met by Freedom Park. The present progress  made
on this project gives us hope that our cries and joys for  freedom  will  be
seen and heard. I want to assure all members that Freedom Park will  reflect
the true history of this country.

Freedom Park will acknowledge South Africa's true history  and  contribution
to humanity. Freedom Park will affirm our  national  identities  and  values
which are embedded in the advent of democracy. It will try to  tell  a  more
accurate and inclusive story of our past. The story will also remind  us  of
the pain and sorrow that marked our past. It will  remind  us  that  freedom
was not an easy path to walk towards. Through this Freedom Park  will  be  a
constant reminder for us to jealously guard our freedom.

On its completion Freedom Park will encompass a museum,  a  monument  and  a
garden of remembrance. It will also be accessible  to  all  South  Africans.
Great South  Africans  whose  selfless  contributions  have  enabled  us  to
achieve freedom and dignity for all will  be  celebrated  and  their  honour
made immortal - a prize reserved for our greatest. Ordinary  men  and  women
whose contributions in diverse fields have  contributed  to  South  Africa's
progress will also be honoured.

When President Mbeki officially launched Freedom Park  this  year,  he  said
that healing and genuine  reconciliation  will  only  come  about  when  the
entire story of South Africa is told. That story belongs to all  of  us.  It
is a story which ends well with freedom. We have the freedom  to  tell  this
story now. It is a story which will help heal the divisions of the past  and
work towards reconciliation and nation-building.

Freedom Park's  conceptual  framework  states  that  Freedom  Park  has  the
potential to interpret and present a powerful portrait of a  nation  in  the
making. Our future leaders are still in the making and Freedom Park  intends
playing an important role in educating our youth.  This  Freedom  Park  will
do,  by  forging  strong  partnerships  with   education   departments   and
supportive institutions  to  instill  and  enhance  positive  attitudes  and
morality through its celebration of great South Africans.

Finally, I want to acknowledge  the  meaningful  and  fruitful  partnerships
that have been formed at governmental level  with  trade  unions,  industry,
education, environment and tourism, foreign affairs and the  Presidency,  of
course, in making Freedom Day the success that it will be.

Let me say to all of us that hope awaits us, as  Mongane  Wally  Serote  has
said. Let us all work hard to build a just and caring society. Let us  enjoy
our heritage and let it help  us  define  nationhood  and  a  South  African
aesthetic. And to the hon Mr Aucamp, keep hoping, let us work together,  and
do not feel threatened. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                 CONSTITUTIONALITY OF BILLS PASSED IN HOUSE.

                                  (Ruling)
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, during the  debate
on the presidential pardons on 14 August, the hon Ms  Smuts  in  her  speech
with reference to reparations said, and I quote:


  It is the Government that is in dereliction of its duty to put a proposal
  before us, but it is we who drafted and passed the law in a time when MPs
  across party lines legislated strictly under the Constitution.

I understood the quoted remark to contain  the  inference  that  since  that
time members have made laws that do not strictly observe  the  Constitution.
This, despite the fact that  members  have  taken  an  oath  to  uphold  the
Constitution.

After the hon member, at my request, clarified her remark I  indicated  that
I would look at the Hansard and consider the matter further.  I  have  given
the matter careful consideration, and regard this matter  as  touching  upon
important issues of which the House should take note. We  must  accept  that
the constitutionality of provisions in a Bill introduced in  Parliament  may
be in doubt and that members may hold different views on whether  particular
provisions are  strictly  constitutional.  It  is,  indeed,  their  duty  to
subject the Bills that come before them to that kind of scrutiny.

There have been instances where the constitutionality  of  a  Bill  was  the
subject of intense debate in this House. Ultimately, in such cases it  comes
down to a matter of interpretation of the Constitution and it  is  only  the
courts that can make a finding on the matter. To the extent that the hon  Ms
Smuts was referring to such instances, her remark can be accepted.

I would, however, caution members against questioning the integrity  of  the
law-making process in Parliament on the basis of strongly  held  convictions
in a particular case. Members should reflect on the fact that we all have  a
responsibility to uphold the Constitution, and have taken an  oath  that  we
will do so. [Interjections.] There is no need for any of those comments.

As members, we should indeed be foremost champions of the  Constitution.  It
must,  therefore,  be  accepted  that  in  carrying  out  their   law-making
functions members will and must be actively committed to ensuring  that,  to
the best of their knowledge, Bills passed comply  fully  and  strictly  with
the Constitution. That is the responsibility of each member  at  all  times.
As long as they scrupulously  carry  out  that  responsibility,  their  good
faith should not be questioned in cases where differences of opinion arise.

                      INTERCEPTION AND MONITORING BILL

                      (Consideration of Report thereon)

There was no debate.
Report adopted.

REGULATION OF INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS AND PROVISION OF COMMUNICATION-
                          RELATED INFORMATION BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Deputy
Chair, colleagues, comrades and friends, as a starting point to this  debate
I would like briefly to refer to the circumstances that led to the need  for
the promotion of the Bill that lies before the House today.

The  Interception  and  Monitoring  Prohibition  Act,  1992,  regulates  the
interception and monitoring of certain communications and conversations.  In
exceptional  circumstances  it  provides  for  the  interception  of  postal
articles and communications and  for  the  monitoring  of  conversations  or
communications.

However, since that Act came into operation on 1 February 1993,  there  have
been substantial technological advances in  respect  of  telecommunications,
such as cellular, satellite  and  computer  communications.  This  has  also
taken place alongside considerable legal developments throughout  the  world
regarding the interception and monitoring  of  communications.  Furthermore,
it is common knowledge that sophisticated telecommunications mechanisms  are
increasingly being utilised in the commission of  organised  crime  in  this
country and countries abroad.

The SA Law Commission, as  part  of  its  review  of  security  legislation,
investigated the Interception and Monitoring Prohibition Act  of  1992  some
time  ago.  The  Interception  and  Monitoring  Bill,  2001,  as  originally
introduced into Parliament, emanated from this SA Law Commission  report  on
that investigation. The Portfolio Committee on  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development, having  considered  that  Bill  and  the  submissions  that  it
received in respect of that Bill, presented the  version  that  lies  before
the House today, namely the Regulation  of  Interception  of  Communications
and Provision of Communication-related Information Bill.

The principal object of  this  Bill  is  to  regulate  the  interception  of
communications, the monitoring of signals and radio frequency spectrums  and
the provision  of  communication-related  information.  Although  I  do  not
intend to discuss or give a detailed explanation of all  the  provisions  of
the Bill, I think that it  is  important  to  highlight  some  of  the  more
important clauses.

Chapter  2  contains  two  general  prohibitions.  Firstly,  no  person  may
intentionally intercept or  attempt  to  intercept,  at  any  place  in  the
Republic,  any  communication  in  the  course  of  its  occurrence  or  its
transmission.  Secondly,  no   telecommunications   service   provider   may
intentionally  provide  or  attempt  to  provide  any  communication-related
information to any person other than the customer of the  telecommunications
service provider. Communication-related  information  is  information  that,
inter alia, identifies the origin, destination, termination and duration  of
an  indirect  communication  generated  or  received  by  a  customer  of  a
telecommunications service provider.  An  example  of  communication-related
information would be if it  is  revealed  that  I  have,  on  my  cellphone,
dialled Miss X from Cape Town International Airport and spoken  to  her  for
13 minutes.

It is important to point out that certain exceptions to  those  two  general
prohibitions are created.  These  exceptions  include  the  interception  of
communications authorised by an  interception  direction  issued  under  the
Bill, the interception of communications by a party to  a  communication  or
with the consent of a party to a  communication,  and  the  interception  of
communications to prevent serious bodily harm.

Chapter 3 deals with bringing applications for and issuing of directions  in
terms of the Bill. Four kinds of directions may be issued in  terms  of  the
Bill,   namely,   the   directions   authorising   the    interception    of
communications;  directions  authorising  the  provision  of  communication-
related information as soon as it becomes available - the Bill defines  this
kind of  information  as  ``real-time  communication-related  information'';
directions authorising the provision  of  communication-related  information
stored  by  a  service  provider,   that   is   the   so-called   ``archived
communication-related  information'';  and  lastly,   directions   directing
decryption key holders to disclose decryption keys or to provide  decryption
assistance in respect of encrypted information.

Chapter 3 also makes provision for issuing of  entry  warrants,  authorising
entry  upon  premises  for  purposes  of  intercepting  postal  articles  or
communications,  installing  and  maintaining   interception   devices   and
removing interception devices. In this regard it must  be  noted  that  only
senior members of the law-enforcement agencies may apply for  directions  or
warrants. Only a judge designated by the Minister may issue  directions  and
warrants under this legislation, but directions for archived  communication-
related information may also be issued by any judge or magistrate.

The  reason  for  this  exception  is  that  archived  communication-related
information can already be obtained in terms of  other  existing  laws,  for
example, section 205 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977.

Strict criteria must be complied with before any direction or entry  warrant
may be issued under this  Bill.  For  example,  directions  authorising  the
interception of communications or the provision of real-time  communication-
related information may only be issued if the judge is satisfied that  there
are reasonable grounds to believe that, firstly,  the  matter  involves  the
commission of a serious offence or, secondly, the information relates  to  a
threat to the public health  or  safety,  national  security  or  compelling
national economic interests of the Republic  or,  thirdly,  the  information
relates to property that is or could probably be  an  instrumentality  of  a
serious offence, or is  or  could  probably  be  the  proceeds  of  unlawful
activities.

Although the general rule is that all  applications,  directions  and  entry
warrants must be in writing, provision is made for making oral  applications
and issuing oral directions and entry  warrants  if  it  is  not  reasonably
practicable, having regard to the urgency of the case or  the  existence  of
exceptional circumstances, to  make  written  application  and  to  issue  a
written direction or entry warrant.

Chapter 5 makes it compulsory  that  all  telecommunications  services  must
have  an   interception   capability.   Storage   of   communication-related
information  by  telecommunications   service   providers   is   also   made
compulsory. Telecommunications service providers must, at  their  own  cost,
acquire the necessary facilities and devices to enable the  interception  of
indirect   communications,   ie   communications    transmitted    over    a
telecommunications  system,  and  the   storage   of   communication-related
information.

Certain other costs that  telecommunications  service  providers  may  incur
under  the  provisions  of  the  Bill  must  be  borne  by  them.   However,
compensation is payable  to  postal  service  providers,  telecommunications
service  providers  and  decryption  key  holders  for  certain   forms   of
assistance  given  by  them  to  the  law-enforcement   officers   executing
directions.

In terms of Chapter 6, the Minister of Intelligence must, at state  expense,
establish one or more centres, to be known as interception centres, for  the
interception of communications in terms of this Act and also equip,  operate
and maintain such interception centres and  acquire,  install  and  maintain
connections between telecommunications systems and interception centres.

Provision is also made for the establishment of an Office  for  Interception
Centres. The director of this office will, amongst other things, manage  and
exercise administrative control over these  centres.  Provision  is  further
made for the establishment  of  an  Internet  Service  Providers  Assistance
Fund. The  purpose  of  this  fund  is  to  assist  small  Internet  service
providers who  are  not  financially  in  a  position  to  comply  with  the
requirement that certain facilities  and  devices  must,  at  own  cost,  be
acquired by telecommunication service providers.
In terms of Chapter 7, telecommunications service providers are required  to
obtain and keep certain information in respect of their customers,  cellular
phones and SIM cards. It also contains a general obligation  to  report  the
loss, theft or destruction of  cellular  phones  or  SIM  cards.  Chapter  8
contains general prohibitions and exceptions  to  this.  Provision  is,  for
example, made  for  the  declaration  of  certain  instruments,  devices  or
equipment, the design  of  which  renders  them  primarily  useful  for  the
purpose of the interception of communications, to be listed  equipment.  The
manufacturing, possession and advertising of such equipment is  specifically
prohibited. However, certain exemptions in  respect  of  those  prohibitions
are created.
In Chapter 9 offences are  created  and  penalties  for  such  offences  are
prescribed. As pointed out in the Memorandum on the  Objects  of  the  Bill,
some of those provisions relate to the following: the unlawful  interception
of  communications;  the   unlawful   provision   of   communication-related
information; failure to give  a  satisfactory  account  of  provision  of  a
cellular phone or a SIM card; the absence of reasonable cause for  believing
that a cellular phone or SIM card is properly acquired;  the  unlawful  acts
in respect of telecommunication and other  equipment,  and  the  failure  to
report the loss, theft or destruction of a cellular phone or SIM card.

Provision is made for revoking a licence  to  provide  a  telecommunications
service in the case of a  second  or  subsequent  conviction  of  a  service
provider of certain offences created in this Bill.

The Bill has been widely criticised in the media  and  in  some  submissions
made to the portfolio committee. The main  grounds  of  the  criticism  are,
firstly, that this legislation will infringe on the  individual's  right  to
privacy as contained in the Bill of Rights and, secondly, that the  division
of costs between the  state  and  telecommunications  service  providers  is
unfair.

I am convinced that sufficient safeguards have been built into the  Bill  to
ensure that we fulfil the duty incumbent on the state to  combat  crime.  We
at the same time will avoid unjustifiable intrusion into any person's  right
to privacy. As far  as  the  cost  issue  is  concerned,  I  know  that  the
portfolio committee has conducted thorough research in  this  regard  and  I
understand that in this issue  the  matter  was  carefully  dealt  with  and
scrutinised. The modern trend is similar to the path we have chosen in  many
foreign jurisdictions. I also believe - and this is very  important  -  that
the Bill will provide an important mechanism in Government's  fight  against
crime, especially organised crime.

Finally, I would  like  to  make  use  of  this  opportunity  to  thank  the
chairperson of the portfolio committee, the hon Johnny  de  Lange,  and  the
members of that committee, for their hard work and  the  consideration  that
they have put into this legislation. I am  of  the  opinion  that  the  high
standard that this committee has set for  itself  in  its  approach  to  and
processing of legislation in general is once again reflected in  the  manner
in which they dealt  with  this  Bill.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  the
officials from our department who have assisted  me  with  this  legislation
and in following the  course  of  this  legislation  through  the  committee
process, and for their guidance and briefings that they have  given  as  the
Bill has progressed.

Dr J T DELPORT: Mnr die Voorsitter, die DP en daarmee ook die DA  ondersteun
hierdie wetgewing. Aanvanklik het daar  sekere  probleme  in  die  wetgewing
bestaan wat gelei het tot ernstige  twyfel  oor  die  toepaslikheid  en  die
noodsaaklikheid om dit te aanvaar. Die meeste van dié besware  is  mettertyd
uit die weg geruim en ek wil die voorsitter, adv De Lange,  bedank.  Ek  mis
sy teenwoordigheid hier. Daar is seker 'n rede daarvoor. Ek hoop nie dit  is
omdat hy nou bedenkinge oor dié wetsontwerp het nie. Hy is natuurlik  iemand
wat 'n goeie debat verwelkom en ons werk lekker saam  totdat  hy  op  sekere
punte steekser as die steekste muil raak en dan kan ons  maar  net  sê:  Ons
verskil. Ons gaan dan nêrens kom nie.

Ek wil 'n paar algemene opmerkings maak  en  daarom  gaan  ek  met  'n  baie
algemene  storietjie  begin.  Ek  het  grootgeword  in  die  dae   van   die
plaastelefone en plaaslyne. Destyds het die tantes, in plaas  van  Loerbroer
te kyk, ingeluister op die plaaslyne. Ons  het  uitgevind  dat  die  enigste
manier om ou tant Anna te kry om nie in te luister nie, was om  iets  te  sê
soos: Hoor hier, het jy gehoor tant  Anna  vry  nou  so  na  ou  Vuiljannie.
[Gelag.] Dan het sy die foon neergesit of gesê: Jy lieg dit! [Gelag.]

Die  eerste  algemene  beginsel  uit  hierdie  storietjie  is  die  reg   op
privaatheid.  In  hierdie  wetgewing  word  dit   besonder   beskerm.   Alle
afluistery is uit.  Alle  meeluistering,  posonderskepping  en  opvang  word
verbied. Dit is 'n misdaad om dit te doen. Tant Anna mag  nie  meer  op  die
plaaslyn inluister nie. Die reg op privaatheid staan dus baie  sterk  voorop
in dié wetgewing. Daar is uitsonderings. Die drie basiese uitsonderings  is:
As ek self 'n party is, of met my toestemming,  kan  iemand  opvang  wat  my
telefoongesprek is. Dit is 'n innoverende  stap.  Tweedens  is  daar  sekere
noodsituasies en derdens is  daar  die  gemagtigde  meeluistering  deur  die
agentskappe wat wet en orde moet handhaaf.

Ons  is  tevrede   dat   ons   baie   streng   beheer   hieroor   kry.   Die
wetstoepassingsagentskappe moet skriftelik aansoek doen  en  hulle  moet  'n
volledige uiteensetting  gee  van  die  redes.  Hulle  doen  aansoek  by  'n
aangewese regter wat vir dié doel afgesonder word. Hulle  moet  aantoon  dat
effektiewe stappe nie andersins moontlik is nie, want alle  ander  maatreëls
is al gevolg en het gefaal.  Dit  is  beperk  tot  ernstige  misdade,  veral
georganiseerde misdaad.

Verder  is  daar  voorgeskrewe  rapportering  en  toesighouding   deur   die
parlementêre komitee vir intelligensie. Daar is goeie  beheer.  Nou  wil  ek
net kom by die algemene effek en sekere dinge waaroor ons steeds verskil.

Die belangrikste innovering  is  ten  opsigte  van  selfone,  e-pos  en  die
moderne manier van kommunikasie. Dit is 'n gesofistikeerde stelsel wat  baie
gesofistikeerde  onderskeppingsinstrumente  benodig.  Dit   is   baie   duur
apparate. Die DA se uitgangspunt is: Die staat kry uit sekere  bronne  geld.
Daarmee moet die staat die land regeer en  bestuur.  Dit  is  die  staat  se
verantwoordelikheid om hierdie instrumente aan te stel, om dít wat nodig  is
om misdaad te bekamp, beskikbaar te stel.

Dié wetgewing maak egter voorsiening daarvoor dat dit  die  diensverskaffers
is  wat  die  nodige  apparatuur  moet  beskikbaar  stel.  Die  lyn  na  die
onderskeppingsentrum word op staatsonkoste geïnstalleer. Ons  meen  dat  die
staat ook vir die eerste stap moet betaal, naamlik die  herleiding  van  die
boodskap.

Ons vereis ook dat die inligting ook gestoor moet word vir  drie  jaar.  Dit
is baie goed om dit te hê. Die vraag is egter of die koste wat dit  vir  die
land inhou, so iets werklik regverdig. Dit is 'n vraag waaroor  ons  ernstig
twyfel.

Derdens meen ons daar is onnodige papierwerk en daar moet selfs  rekords  by
voorafbetaalde selfone gehou word. Dit is goed dat dit gehou word ter  wille
van toegang tot die rekords. Die vraag is egter of  die  koste  werklik  die
voordeel uitbalanseer. Ons het  'n  probleem  met  die  terugwerkendheid  op
bestaande lisensies. 'n Saak wat lisensiehouers maar self moet uitklaar,  is
tot watter mate hulle as bestaande  lisensiehouers  deur  wetgewing  verplig
kan word om hierdie instrumente aan te bring.

Ek wil nou in die algemeen maan tot omsigtigheid. 'n Onlangse ervaring -  en
ek is jammer om dit te moet ophaal - toe 'n Minister met  groot  stelligheid
aangekondig het dat prominente persone besig is met 'n sameswering teen  die
President, laat 'n mens met 'n gevoel  van  sinisme.  Dit  het  kort  daarna
geblyk dat dit onjuis was. As so 'n belangrike saak met  soveel  stelligheid
aangekondig kon word, wat van die arme gewone burger  wat  blootgestel  word
aan daardie tipe agterdog? Ons gee van die gesofistikeerdste apparatuur  aan
ons polisie en ons wetstoepassers. Dit moet gebruik word om misdadigers  aan
die kaak te stel en ons versoek is: Gebruik dit om misdadigers aan  die  man
te bring en nie vir politieke doeleindes nie.

Ek kon nooit presies die bedrag bepaal nie, maar dit is seker by 'n  miljard
rand wat uit die ekonomie gesuig  gaan  word  om  hierdie  vermoë  te  skep,
enersyds aan die kant van die staat  en  andersyds  aan  die  kant  van  die
verbruikers. Niks hiervan gaan die veiligheid van die gewone  ou  op  straat
werklik raak nie. Dit gaan nie ons arme  dogtertjies  wat  gruwelik  vermink
word, beskerm nie. Dit gaan nie ons plaasmoorde verminder nie. Dit gaan  nie
die verkragtingslagoffers, die arme vrouens wat willoos verkrag  word,  help
nie. Ek sê nie hierdie wetgewing is onnodig nie.

Ons moet egter nie die een ding doen en die ander nalaat  nie.  Ons  publiek
roep uit daar buite: ``Vang die misdadigers!'' Met  net  so  'n  luide  stem
word gevra: ``Gee ook vir ons veiligheid in ons daaglikse bestaan, waar  dit
nie meer veilig is om in my motor te ry nie, want ek kan beroof word  of  my
motor kan gekaap word''. Ons moet die een doen en dan  kos  dit  'n  miljard
rand om dit wel te doen. Ons moet ook nie  huiwer  om  'n  miljard  rand  te
bestee aan die veiligheid van ons mense op straat, die  veiligheid  van  ons
mense in hulle huise, en ons vroue en kinders nie. Suid-Afrika vra  dit  van
ons. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr J T DELPORT: Mr Chairperson, the DP as  well  as  the  DA  support  this
legislation. At the outset there were certain problems  in  the  legislation
that led to serious doubt regarding the enforceability and the necessity  of
adopting it. Most of these objections were resolved over time  and  I  would
like to thank the Chairperson, Adv De  Lange.  I  miss  his  presence  here.
There is probably a reason for that. I hope it is not  because  he  now  has
qualms regarding this legislation. He is someone, of course who  welcomes  a
good debate and we work  well  together,  that  is  until  he  becomes  more
stubborn than the most stubborn mule on certain points and then we can  only
say: We disagree. Then we are not going to get anywhere.

I would like to make a few general comments and for that reason I  am  going
to start with a very general little story. I grew up in  the  days  of  farm
telephones and farm lines. In those days, instead of watching  Big  Brother,
the old ladies listened in on the farm lines. We figured out that  the  only
way to get old Aunt Anna not to listen in was to say something like:  Listen
here, have you heard that Aunt Anna is now making eyes at old Dirty  Jannie.
[Laughter.] Then she would put  the  phone  down  or  say:  You  are  lying!
[Laughter.]

The first general principle of this little story is the  right  to  privacy.
In this legislation it is especially protected. All  eavesdropping  is  out.
All bugging, interception of post and  recording  is  prohibited.  It  is  a
crime to do so. Aunt Anna is no longer allowed to  listen  in  on  the  farm
line. The right to privacy is therefore  very  strongly  supported  in  this
legislation. There are exceptions. The three  basic  exceptions  are:  If  I
myself am a party, or  with  my  permission,  then  someone  may  record  my
telephone conversation - this is an  innovative  step;  secondly  there  are
certain emergency situations; and thirdly, there is the  authorised  bugging
by agencies that have to maintain law and order.

We are satisfied that we are getting very strict control over this. The  law
enforcement agencies have to put requests to do this  in  writing  and  they
have to present a complete exposition of the reasons. They  apply  for  this
from an appointed judge who has been appointed for this purpose.  They  have
to prove that effective steps are not possible otherwise, because all  other
measures had been taken  and  failed.  It  is  limited  to  serious  crimes,
especially organised crime.

Furthermore  there  is  prescribed  reporting   and   supervision   by   the
Parliamentary Committee for Intelligence. There is good control. Now I  only
want to get to the general effect and certain things about  which  we  still
disagree.

The most important innovation concerns cellphones,  e-mail  and  the  modern
way  of  communicating.  It  is  a  sophisticated  system  that  needs  many
sophisticated interception equipment. This is very expensive apparatus.  The
DA's point of departure is: The state receives money from  certain  sources.
With that the state must govern and manage the country. It  is  the  state's
responsibility to acquire these  instruments,  to  make  available  what  is
necessary in order to curb crime.

This legislation, however, provides that it is the  service  providers  that
have  to  make  the  necessary  apparatus  available.  The   line   to   the
interception centre is installed at state expense. We think that  the  state
should also pay for the first step, namely the redirecting of the message.

We also require that the information must be stored for three years.  It  is
very good to have it. The question,  however,  is  whether  the  costs  this
means for the country really justify something like this. It is  a  question
about which we have serious doubts.

Thirdly we believe that there is unnecessary  paperwork,  and  records  even
have to be kept for pre-paid cellphones. It is good that this is being  kept
for the sake of access to the records. The  question  is,  however,  whether
the cost is truly even with the  advantage.  We  have  a  problem  with  the
retrospective effect on existing licenses. A  matter  that  licence  holders
have to clear up for  themselves,  is  to  what  extent  they,  as  existing
licence holders, can be forced by legislation to install these instruments.

I would now like to, in general, urge for caution.  A  recent  experience  -
and  I  regret  having  to  mention  it  when  a  Minister  announced   very
assertively that prominent persons were involved  in  a  conspiracy  against
the President, - leaves one with a feeling of cynicism.  Shortly  thereafter
this proved to be untrue. If such an important  matter  could  be  announced
with so much assertiveness, what about the poor everyday citizen  who  comes
under that kind of suspicion? We supply our police and  law  enforcers  with
the most sophisticated apparatus. It has to be used to expose criminals  and
not for political objectives.

I could never quite determine the amount, but it  is  probably  close  to  a
billion rand that is going to be sucked out of the economy  to  create  this
capacity, on the part of the state on the one hand and on the  part  of  the
consumers on the other. None of this will affect the safety of the  ordinary
man in the street. It will not protect our poor little girls who  are  being
horribly disfigured. It will not decrease our farm  killings.  It  will  not
help the rape victims, the poor women being defencelessly raped.  I  am  not
saying that this legislation is unnecessary.

We should not, however, do one thing  and  neglect  to  do  the  other.  Our
public is crying out out there: ``Arrest the criminals!''  With  an  equally
loud voice the following is being asked: ``Grant  us  safety  in  our  daily
existence too, where it is no longer  safe  for  me  to  drive  my  vehicle,
because I could be robbed or my vehicle could be hijacked.'' We must do  one
thing and then it would cost a billion rand to actually  do  it.  We  should
not hesitate either to spend a billion rand on the safety of our  people  in
the street, the safety of our people in  their  homes,  and  our  women  and
children. South Africa asks this of us. [Applause.]]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, the Bill before us today will go down in  history
as one that many people initially received with mixed feelings. That was  no
surprise as it will affect  the  private  lives  and  communication  of  our
citizens. In the  main,  those  citizens  are  law-abiding  members  of  the
community. But, it would be foolhardy to argue that  crime  does  not  exist
and even more foolhardy to argue that communication does not  play  a  vital
role in the planning and execution of crime.

Parliament, therefore, had the unenviable task of finding a balance  between
the rights of people to privacy and the needs of the state  to  fight  crime
with all the means at its disposal. The IFP  believes  that  a  balance  has
been achieved and that sufficient checks and balances have been  built  into
the Bill to protect the fundamental rights of our citizens.

The Portfolio Committee on  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  dealt
with the Bill in a comprehensive and thorough manner in order to get to  the
bottom of all of its complicated provisions and  implications.  We  received
thousands of submissions from various quarters. The IFP  believes  that  the
final  Bill  is  a  much  better  product  due  to  the   extensive   public
consultations that took place.

The IFP will support the Bill. In supporting  the  Bill,  I  would  like  to
concentrate on just a few issues. Chapter 2 of the Bill states very  clearly
that no person may intentionally  intercept  or  attempt  to  intercept,  or
authorise any other person to intercept or  attempt  to  intercept,  at  any
place in the Republic, any communication in the course of its occurrence  or
transmission. But that provision is limited  by  the  provision  that  there
will be a designated judge who will  give  authority  for  interception  and
monitoring, and for authorising warrants  for  that  interception.  This  is
typical of the checks and balances that I referred to earlier.

In essence, it means that interception and monitoring can only  be  done  in
terms of the rule of law. Before  authorising  an  interception,  the  judge
must be satisfied that the following  criteria  have  been  met:  a  serious
offence has been, or is being, or will  probably  be  committed;  an  actual
threat to public health or safety, or national security of the  Republic  is
evident; and if there is a potential threat to public health and  safety  or
the national security of the Republic. Those are just a few of the  criteria
that must be met before interception is  authorised.  Again,  it  should  be
stressed that  those  are  adequate  checks  and  balances  to  protect  our
citizens from the power of the state.

Clauses 24 and 25 of the Bill deal with progress  reports  and  interception
and monitoring that must be furnished  to  the  authorised  judge,  and  the
cancellation of interception and entry warrants where  no  progress  reports
were made. The IFP believes that this  provision  is  an  important  way  of
protecting citizens. The IFP is, however, concerned about the fact  that  an
oral application for interception and monitoring  of  communication  may  be
requested by an officer and  granted  by  a  judge  even  though  a  written
application need only reach the judge  or  magistrate  after  a  further  24
hours.

It is understandable that it may be necessary in  extreme  cases,  where  an
eminent danger can be shown, for such a short cut to be made possible.  But,
our concern is that the short cut may be  abused  for  purposes  other  than
legitimate law enforcement reasons. For  instance,  it  is  no  secret  that
fraud and corruption do occur in our law enforcement agencies. Let  us  hope
that these provisions will not  aid  and  abet  fraud  and  corruption,  and
detract from other checks and balances in the Bill  that  were  inserted  to
protect our law-abiding citizens.

Uma sengisika elijikayo, ngifuna ukwexwayisa labo okuyothi uma  belahlekelwa
ngamaselifoni bangawabiki ngoba becabanga ukuthi sebezothenga  amanye  ngoba
lokho kungase kumdonsele ophathe lowo owenze njalo ngoba isigebengu  singase

esihle leso. Ngithi mabakhumbule-ke ukuwabika  amaselifoni  uma  elahlekile.
(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[In my opinion, I would like to warn those who lose  their  cellular  phones
and do not report them as lost because they are thinking of  buying  others.
A person who does this is  in  danger  because  a  criminal  can  take  that
cellular phone and use it for criminal purposes. If one does not  report  it
to the police, the case can be directed  to  him  or  her.  One  could  find
oneself having to face criminal charges that one is not responsible for.

Therefore, I ask my brothers and sisters to report  their  lost  or  damaged
cellular phones to the police stations so that they will be given  stickers,
which show that they have lost their phones. This will  help  them  in  case
their cellular phones fall into the hands of criminals. That is the  warning
I can give to them and which can  make  us  succeed  because  this  Bill  is
delicate. It deals with delicate issues, which we did not dispose  of,  when
we discussed them here. Therefore, this is a very good warning. I am  saying
that they should remember to report their lost cellular phones.]

[Mr M T MASUTHA: Comrades, today is an important  day,  in  so  far  as  the
Africans have said that ``even if you hide  matters,  there  are  those  who
will uncover you or expose you''. Those criminals are now  in  trouble.  The
Bill before us will enable the Government to deal with them accordingly.  As
Africans  would  say,  ``sekhukhuni  se  bonwa  ke  sebataladi.''   [It   is
impossible to keep a secret because eventually it will come  out.]  We  will
show them that if they continue to destabilise our freedom we will hit  back
severely.]

The  Bill  before  us  represents  yet  another  milestone  in  the  ANC-led
government's  onslaught  against  crime.   It   provides   a   comprehensive
regulatory  framework  for  the  interception  and  monitoring  of   certain
communications, whilst at the same time  protecting  the  right  to  privacy
guaranteed under the Constitution by prohibiting  unauthorised  interception
of communications. Amongst the concerns raised by service providers  in  the
telecommunications industry is the  assertion  that  the  implementation  of
this Bill will  occasion  untold  and  undue  financial  hardships  for  the
private sector by imposing costs on them, which  to  their  mind  should  be
borne by the state. They insist, by implication,  that  it  is  the  state's
sole responsibility to create the necessary capacity and introduce  measures
to effectively deal with crime,  an  assertion  with  which  the  ANC,  with
respect, cannot agree.

Chapter  5  of  the  Bill,  which  deals  with  this  matter,   requires   a
telecommunication service provider to provide  a  telecommunication  service
which has the capability to  be  intercepted  and  to  store  communication-
related information. It further empowers the Minister of Communications,  in
consultation with the Minister of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
and other relevant Ministers, after  consultation  with  all  concerned,  to
issue a directive on how this legal obligation is to be complied with.

The aforesaid chapter further  requires  that  a  telecommunication  service
provider incur the cost of purchasing or leasing  the  necessary  facilities
that will enable the service  provider  to  comply  with  this  law.  Having
imposed this obligation on service providers  on  the  one  hand,  the  Bill
proceeds to provide for  reasonable  compensation  according  to  prescribed
tariffs to postal and  telecommunication  service  providers  for  providing
assistance  to  law  enforcement  authorities  in   effecting   interception
directives under this law.

The Bill does seek to strike a balance between the responsibilities  of  the
state  to  combat  crime  at  its  own  cost  on  the  one  hand,  and   the
responsibilities of the rest of society to play their role in assisting  and
making it possible for the state to do so  on  the  other.  The  devastating
effect that serious and organised crime can have on  a  country's  security,
health, environment and economy is all too familiar to all of us with the 9-
11 aftermath and other acts of terror still fresh in our minds. In  as  much
as the democracy and freedom that we are  all  currently  enjoying  did  not
come cheaply, it is equally so that to sustain it will come  at  a  cost  in
one way or another which all of us as compatriots will have to  be  prepared
to bear.

The  Bill  nevertheless  recognises  the  reality   that   smaller   service
providers, particularly in  the  internet  environment,  may  not  have  the
capacity  individually  to  sustain  the  costs  of  providing  interception
capability  as  required  by  this  Bill.  It  therefore  provides  for  the
establishment of an internet service provider assistance fund. The  fund  is
to be created with the contributions levied on  such  service  providers  in
exchange  for  being  granted  exemption  from   acquiring   the   necessary
facilities required for purposes of interceptability under the Bill.

For one or more interception centres, and for the creation of  one  or  more
interception  centres  to   enable   the   state   to   effectively   effect
interceptions within the framework of this Bill, the cost  of  establishing,
maintaining and resourcing such centres is to borne entirely by  the  state.
It is important to bear in  mind,  as  other  hon  members  before  me  have
already indicated, that  the  Bill  is  not  opening  up  the  public  to  a
wholesale interception of their private communications  by  law  enforcement
authorities. On the contrary,  it  restricts  the  interception  of  private
communications only to circumstances where such interception  is  sanctioned
through an interception direction by a judge for purposes  of  the  Act  and
under very stringent conditions specifically prescribed therein.

There are exemptions to these rules specified in the Act under  which  prior
authorisation by a judge will  not  be  required.  Such  exemptions  include
situations wherein the interception is performed by or with the  consent  of
the person party to the communication in connection with the carrying on  of
a business or to prevent serious bodily harm.

In  conclusion,  I  wish  to  congratulate  the  Minister  of  Justice   and
Constitutional  Development  and  all  those  who  have  supported  him   in
introducing this Bill, for the bold step he took in  introducing  this  very
complex yet very vital instrument at a time in  the  history  of  the  world
when such an instrument is most  needed,  given  the  circumstances  I  have
already alluded to. The chair of the justice  committee  together  with  the
legal drafters must be commended  for  spending  many  sleepless  nights  in
ensuring the perfection of this Bill, a task which the rest of  us  did  our
best to help fulfil by providing them with our support.

The ANC therefore supports this Bill with all the  enthusiasm  it  deserves.
[Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Mr Chairperson, everyone has the right  to  privacy,  which
includes  the  right  not  to  have  the  privacy  of  their  communications
infringed. Or do they? In spite of this guarantee in  the  Constitution  the
answer provided by this Bill is probably no, or  maybe  yes  and  no.  Under
certain  circumstances,  which  are  spelt  out  in   this   Bill,   private
communications are not and  should  not  be  immune  from  scrutiny  by  the
authorities.
The challenge to us in the portfolio committee was  threefold:  Firstly,  to
ensure  that  bugging,  tapping  and  other   forms   of   interception   of
communications are not legal unless done in terms  of  this  law;  secondly,
that legalised bugging is not excessively  intrusive  and  is  curtailed  in
terms of the purposes of achieving certain legitimate goals;  thirdly,  that
the limitations on the right to privacy, included in this legislation,  pass
the test for the limitations of rights  as  set  out  in  the  Constitution,
namely, that it is reasonable in an open and  democratic  society  based  on
human dignity, equality and freedom.

We, in the Portfolio Committee on Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,
ably assisted by the department,  have  toiled  mightily  to  achieve  these
goals. The Bill has been before the committee for more than a year  and  has
been extensively panel-beaten. In fact, it is presented to the House by  the
committee rather than the department. It  has  gone  through  seven  drafts.
Days of hearings took place.

This Bill prohibits the provision of  telecommunication  services  which  do
not have the capacity to be  intercepted.  One  can  safely  say  that  many
communications and service providers are still  unhappy  about  the  onerous
and expensive obligations placed on them by this  legislation.  The  expense
for service providers inevitably means that users - the  ordinary  consumers
of telephone, cellphone and internet services - are ultimately going to  pay
more for the service.

During  the  hearings  doubt  was  also  cast  on  whether  technically   or
technologically  bugging   of   certain   services   can   be   successfully
implemented. I am certainly no judge of that, but I believe it is an  aspect
of the Bill that needs careful ongoing monitoring.

Not only  did  this  Bill  have  a  difficult  birth,  but  it  is  a  long,
complicated and wordy piece of legislation, as other speakers  have  pointed
out. Was it necessary to spell out in such minute detail  the  circumstances
under which legalised bugging may take place and also to  extend  the  reach
of  legalised  bugging  to  cellphone  and  internet  services?  With   some
hesitation about certain aspects of the legislation, the New NP agrees  that
it is necessary and we will be supporting the Bill. [Applause.]

The New NP has always supported controlled  interception  of  communication,
whether written or telephonic, for the purposes of fighting crime. This  was
the purpose of the original Interception and Monitoring Prohibition  Act  in
1992 and the principle has been extended in the Bill before us.

Since George Orwell published Animal Farm, most people  believe  the  state,
alias Big Brother, can and possibly is  prying  and  tapping  their  phones,
etc.

This Bill  says  that  they  cannot,  except  under  controlled  conditions.
``Controlled'' means that, as a rule, applications for interception must  be
made to a former or retired judge designated especially for the  purpose  of
hearing and disposing  of  applications  for  interception.  Applicants  are
restricted  to  officers  in  the   police,   the   Independent   Complaints
Directorate, the Scorpions and the Intelligence Services and  they  must  be
authorised by a senior officer in such a service.

The grounds on which  an  interception  direction  may  be  granted  by  the
designated judge are at the heart of the Bill and are restricted firstly  to
a situation where the judge has reasonable grounds for believing  a  serious
offence has been, is being or will be committed  -  and  the  definition  of
``serious offence'' includes Schedule 1 offences, like murder and rape,  and
organised crime - or that there is an actual or potential threat  to  public
safety, national security or compelling national economic interest. The  New
NP supports bugging, tapping and prying to achieve these ends.

The most controversial aspect of the Bill is that the cost  of  intercepting
a communication or storing information and maintaining archives of  material
must  be  born  by  the  service  provider.  In  the  case  of   cellphones,
particularly short-term prepaid contracts, and the  internet,  this  can  be
technically burdensome and even difficult and very expensive.

While our legislation follows similar laws passed in Australia  and  Canada,
the New NP believes that the implementation  of  this  aspect  of  the  Bill
should also be carefully monitored to ensure  that  it  is  financially  and
practicably  feasible  throughout  the  industry,  as  we   are   truly   in
unchartered waters here.

There are a number of other controversial aspects of  the  Bill,  like  what
seem to be potentially heavy penalties for rather minor  misdemeanours  such
as a failure to report a lost or stolen cellphone. This  is  a  new  offence
almost adding insult to injury. South Africans, are so used to having  their
cellphones snatched at stop streets, often through a smashed car window,  or
lifted from their desks, that they are automatically insured.

The only reason in the past for them to report the loss to  the  police  was
for insurance purposes, and manifestly not to have  the  thief  apprehended,
the crime solved or the phone recovered. Be that as it may, we  believe  the
courts can be trusted to use  their  discretion  in  these  matters  and  we
support the Bill.

Mr J T MASEKA:  Chairperson,  many  countries  across  the  world  do  allow
interception and monitoring of certain  communications  to  prevent  serious
crimes and in the  security  of  national  interest,  and  such  crimes  are
committed  by  individuals  and/or  group  of  persons  using   the   modern
sophisticated means of communications. It is  therefore  important  to  have
certain communications intercepted and monitored  to  avoid  serious  crimes
being committed. Crimes  involving  pure  economical  and  bodily  harm  are
committed by criminals using certain means of  communications.  Interception
of communications is also important for the purpose of determining  location
in the event of emergency, for example, in the case of kidnapping.

It is imperative  to  have  these  communications  controlled  by  means  of
interception and  monitoring  of  certain  communications  through  properly
regulated rules to  avoid  the  abuse  of  interception  and  monitoring  by
certain officials and/or individuals. This Bill intends to curb and  control
criminal activities, and it also makes  provision  for  the  prohibition  of
certain telecommunication services that do  not  have  the  capacity  to  be
intercepted.

This Bill  also  makes  provision  for  the  regulation  of  the  making  of
applications  for,  and  the   issuing   of   directions   authorising   the
interception and monitoring of certain communications used by  criminals  to
commit crimes. Crimes have a negative impact on the economy of  our  country
and  also  on  international  relations,  and  they  result  in  substantial
financial  gain  for  the  individuals,  groups  of  persons  or  syndicates
committing the offence. But the Asset Forfeiture Unit takes care of it.

Interception and monitoring of communications  can  be  done  by  authorised
persons and/or any person other than a law  enforcement  officer  who  is  a
party to the communications, unless such  communication  is  intercepted  by
such person for the purposes of committing an offence. The UDM supports  the
Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairman, in view of the technological advances in respect  of
telecommunications such as cellular, satellite and computer  communications,
there was a need to revisit  the  existing  legislation.  Telecommunications
are also increasingly being used in the commission of  especially  organised
crime, heists and other serious  violent  crimes.  The  result  is  the  new
legislation, which  will  totally  replace  the  existing  Interception  and
Monitoring Prohibition Act of 1992.

The  ACDP's  initial  concerns  regarding  the  Bill   have   largely   been
accommodated,  in  that  the  right  to  privacy  is  protected  by   making
interception of communications subject to judicial scrutiny.  Communications
can only be legally intercepted when law enforcement officers have  obtained
a court order from a designated judge subject  to  certain  exceptions.  The
law enforcement officers will have to persuade the judge, inter  alia,  that
a serious offence has been or will be committed, or that there is an  actual
or potential threat to public health, safety or national security.

The critical aspect of this piece of legislation will be judicial  scrutiny,
to ensure that the interception and monitoring is done only  to  pursue  the
aims of law enforcement, and not for  some  nefarious  or  corrupt  purpose.
During hearings, we were told of  incidents  where  section  205  orders  in
terms of the Criminal  Procedure  Act  had  been  altered  after  the  judge
granted them.

This illustrates how abuse can take  place  and  must  be  guarded  against.
There is no doubt that the Bill will also have a significant effect  on  the
communications industry. Other speakers have referred to the cost aspect  of
rendering telecommunications services interceptable and  providing  for  the
storage of call-related information.

We trust that the Government will monitor the effect of these costs  on  the
industry,  and  consider  introducing  subsidies  should  the  costs   prove
exorbitant and negatively affect the industry. Undoubtedly these costs  will
be passed on to the consumer.

In conclusion, the ACDP will  support  the  Bill,  as  it  will  provide  an
important weapon  in  the  fight  against  organised  crime  and  terrorism.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I wish to call hon  members  to
order. I think you are being disruptive. Please come to order.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek wil darem  net  vir  die  agb  Dr
Delport iets sê. Toe ek klein  was,  onthou  ek  nog  die  telefoon  wat  so
afgeluister is. Dit was nie eintlik afluistering nie. Dit was  maar  net  'n
telefoonkonferensie wat die mense van daardie tyd gehad het.

Hierdie Wet is 'n tipiese ja-nee-wet, 'n  wet  wat,  sou  'n  mens  daarteen
stem, kan daar geargumenteer word dat niemand  misdaad  in  Suid-Afrika  wil
bekamp nie. Dit is so dat die beginsel van die wet aanvaarbaar is,  dit  was
deel van die vorige bedeling. Inteendeel,  die  beginsel  van  meeluistering
word wêreldwyd erken. Daarom sal die VF hierdie wetsontwerp steun.

Ek wil egter meld dat daar 'n aantal aspekte is  waaroor  geargumenteer  kan
word: Is dit werklik die moeite werd aan die  einde  van  die  dag?  Ek  wil
vandag vir dié Huis sê dat die  gesofistikeerde  misdadiger  alreeds  planne
het om dit te omseil. Dit is net eenvoudig so dat aan die einde van die  dag
sal dit die gewone verbruiker wees wat sal moet opdok  vir  die  kostes  wat
met dié wetsontwerp gepaard gaan.

Dit laat my dink aan die wapenwet. Die wetsgehoorsame  landsburger  word  'n
sekere las toegedien om die misdadiger by te kom, maar  in  werklikheid  kom
die misdadiger steeds weg. Ons sal dit nie kan voorkom  met  wetgewing  nie.
Ons sal hulle nie heeltemal kan vasvat nie. Die VF aanvaar  dat  hierdie  'n
poging is. Dit is moderne tegnologie en ons moet  daarby  aanpas,  maar  hoe
dit in die werklikheid effektief toegepas gaan word, sal ons  by  'n  latere
geleentheid moet evalueer;  hetsy  by  'n  intelligensiekomitee  of  by  die
parlementêre verslag  wat  ingedien  sal  word.  Ons  sal  dan  kyk  of  die
verbruiker waarde vir sy geld  kry.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, I just want to say  something  to  the  hon
Delport. I remember how, when I was a child, people used  to  listen  in  on
the telephone. Actually it was not eavesdropping. It was merely a  telephone
conference that the people of that time held.

This is a typical yes-no Act, an Act which, if one were to vote against  it,
would result in the argument being raised that no one wants to combat  crime
in the country. It is a fact that the principle of the  Act  is  acceptable;
it was part of the former dispensation. On the contrary,  the  principle  of
interception is acknowledged internationally. Therefore the FF will  support
this Bill.

I do, however, wish to mention that there  a  few  aspects  which  could  be
argued about: Is it really worthwhile at the end of the day? I want  to  say
to the House today that the sophisticated  criminal  already  has  plans  to
evade it. It is just so that at the end of the day the  consumer  will  have
to pay for the expenses associated with the implementation of this Bill.

That brings me to  the  arms  Act.  The  law-abiding  citizen  is  given  an
additional burden in order to get  to  the  criminal,  but  in  reality  the
criminal still manages to get away. We will not  be  able  to  prevent  that
through legislation. We will not clamp  down  on  them  completely.  The  FF
accepts that this is an effort. It is modern technology and  we  must  adapt
to it, but how it will be effectively applied in reality  we  will  have  to
determine at a  later  stage;  be  it  at  a  meeting  of  the  intelligence
committee or through the parliamentary report to be submitted. We will  then
see whether the consumer gets value for his or her money. [Applause.]]

Dr S E M PHEKO:  Chairperson,  a  law  on  interception  and  monitoring  of
communications is characteristic of fascist regimes.  In  this  country,  it
reminds us of the regimes of J B Vorster and Hendrik F Verwoerd.  The  major
purpose of this Bill is to  regulate  the  interception  and  monitoring  of
certain communications, including intercepting postal articles.

Communication includes, and I quote:


  A conversation or a message, and any part  of  conversation  or  message,
  whether in the form of speech, music or other sounds, data, text,  visual
  images or signals.

Those behind this Bill must take this nation into their confidence. What  is
the cause of the panic  and  fear  on  their  part?  In  that  way,  we  can
understand the reason behind this legislation which  seems  to  violate  the
Constitution. There is talk of democracy,  rule  of  law  and  this  country
boasts of having the best Constitution. But is a fascist Bill  such  as  the
Interception and Monitoring Bill in concord with this claim?

From our past experience, such laws are capable of being  abused,  and  they
have always resulted  in  draconian  legislation,  which  resulted  in,  for
example, the Unlawful Organisations Act through  which  the  PAC  and  other
political  organisations  were  banned.  On  22  August  of  this   year   a
constituency office of the PAC was raided by  police,  who  said  that  they
were looking  for  weapons.  They  found  no  weapons.  On  28  August  SAPS
commissioner Moranodi Gaopebe said that an internal investigation  would  be
carried out. To this date, there has been no explanation as to why  the  PAC
office was raided by police and searched for weapons.

How frequent will such things happen  when  the  Government  is  armed  with
interception and monitoring legislation? This  law  does  not  belong  to  a
democratic country. It is  a  relic  of  fascist  regimes.  [Time  expired.]
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon  S  Rajbally  has  just
come out of hospital. We wish her well. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I am happy  to  be  back  and  thank  you  for
welcoming me.

Communication, key factor to the convening of all activities,  has  received
continuous  upgrade  technologically.   All   Government   departments   are
acknowledgeably working hard at attaining sustainable development,  equality
and correcting injustices of the past. Contributing  to  this  metamorphosis
is upgrading South African methods, trends and performance to  the  rest  of
the world of which in this case, would be the communication industry.

This advancement is felt to be to the betterment of South Africans who  have
gained respect through our experience, but we need  to  gain  respect  as  a
valid competitor in other faculties too. And  this  would  require  bringing
policy in line with competition. In view of the Bill  under  debate,  it  is
evident that this Bill would certainly not be a conclusion on the matter  it
serves to address, but  rather  a  stepping  stone  towards  bringing  South
Africa in line with other technologically advanced  countries  such  as  the
USA and the UK.

In view of  this,  it  is  evident  that  the  Bill  contains  a  number  of
loopholes, as strongly expressed by holdings such as Vodacom, MTN  and  Cell
C. The MF feels that this Bill is needed to bring us  in  line  with  global
advancement. However, the necessity is to maintain confidentiality  and  the
need to safeguard privacy is essential.

The MF is pleased to note that many concerned parties  and  role-players  in
the formulation of this Bill have provided  valid  criticism  and  necessary
input and it is hoped that the same parties  concerned  remain  involved  in
this process. The MF supports this Bill.

Mr L T LANDERS: Mr Chairperson, shortly after the 11  September  bombing  of
the World Trade Centre in New York, it was reported in the  media  that  the
perpetrators had used computer technology  including  e-mail,  websites  and
the internet to communicate with one another. It was also reported that  the
perpetrators had made use of the mobile phone  pay-as-you-go  technology  to
communicate with one another.

South Africa's legal developments have  not  kept  pace  with  the  gigantic
technological advances in respect  of  cellullar,  satellites  and  computer
communications through the use of e-mail  and  the  electronic  transfer  of
information. It is universally acknowledged that such  technology  is  being
widely used by organised criminal syndicates.

The Bill before this house seeks to address the  fact  that  South  Africa's
legal development has  lagged  behind  the  technological  advances  I  have
referred to. What we are doing, in the words of the journalist  Paul  Stobe,
is simply upgrading systems for security agencies  who  are  lagging  behind
crime syndicates in the use of information and communication technology.

One of the  reasons  that  criminal  and,  in  particular,  organised  crime
syndicates have managed to remain  a  step  ahead  of  our  law  enforcement
agencies is their prolific use of information and communication  technology.
If  we  do  not  allow  our  law  enforcement  agencies  to  tap  into  such
communications within  a  strict  legal  framework,  criminals  will  remain
elusive and they will continue to thrive.

The significance of  11  September  in  relation  to  this  Bill  cannot  be
overemphasised. It was also reported in the  media  soon  after  that  event
that one of the perpetrators  had  made  a  telephone  call  to  someone  in
Canada. Using the technology  and  relevant  laws  at  their  disposal,  the
respective law enforcement agencies in America and in Canada  were  able  to
trace the origins of this call as well as the person to whom it was made  in
Canada.

What is frightening to me, however,  is  the  fact  that  the  Canadian  law
enforcement agencies were able to obtain a list of all  the  calls  made  by
this person in Canada, including and in particular, one that was made  to  a
person here in South Africa.

In and of itself, this telephone call from someone in Canada to  someone  in
South Africa may not constitute an act of terror, nor was it  necessarily  a
part of 11 September conspiracy. However, we  cannot  ignore  the  links  to
such calls. It is for this reason, amongst others, that we have  created  an
obligation on persons who sell cellphones  or  simcards  to  retain  certain
critical information. We refer to this as the paper  trail  and  it  can  be
found in Chapter 7 of the Bill.

Internationally, the advent of modern technology  has  resulted  in  similar
crime-fighting challenges in other countries. One  particular  challenge  to
which the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development  has
paid particular attention, relates to the prepaid system  or  pay-as-you-go.
Currently,  Brazil  is  seriously  considering  banning  or  outlawing  this
prepaid system altogether  because,  according  to  President  Cardoso,  its
disposable nature and a lack of  a  paper  trail  in  the  Brazilian  system
facilitates and even spawns  and  promotes  criminal  activities.  Countries
like New Zealand, Britain and Canada are all revising  and  reassessing  the
looseness of the prepaid system.

We have gone the less extreme route of requiring prepaid cellphone users  to
be identified and verified by the  suppliers  of  this  system,  and  by  no
stretch of the imagination of the hon Dr Pheko  can  countries  like  Canada
and New Zealand be regarded as fascist dictatorships.

Another requirement of this Bill is that lost or stolen cellphones  must  be
reported. Failure to do so is an offence. If we think this  is  onerous,  we
should be reminded of the recent experiences of this city of Cape Town  when
cellphones were used to detonate  bombs  that  killed  and  maimed  innocent
people.

Two recent articles in the written media served to highlight  and  underline
this point. I refer to the Daily News of 3  September  2002  in  an  article
that reads as follows, and I quote:


  A  national  cellphone  theft  syndicate   was   smashed   when   private
  investigators and police stormed a Durban cellphone shop, seizing  nearly
  R500 000 in electronic equipment and arresting three Democratic  Republic
  of Congo nationals. Police  from  the  Durban  crime  intelligence  unit,
  together with private investigators, cracked the syndicate after a month-
  long investigation which began in the Eastern Cape and ended in Durban.


  Last month cellphones and cellphone starter packs  valued  at  more  than
  R100 000 were stolen from the store of a national  retailer  in  Cradock.
  Private investigators, together with detectives from several police crime
  intelligence units, managed  to  track  the  cellphones  to  Durban.  The
  cellphone were allegedly being sold to crime syndicates  who  were  using
  them to commit crimes.

A further example of this can be found in the Sunday Times  editorial  of  1
September 2002, headed ``We must support the war on cell crime''. I quote:


  Government's announcement that it intends to impose  heavy  penalties  on
  people whose cellphones are stolen but do not report  this  promptly  has
  met with some criticism. But it is a step that deserves our support.  The
  use of  cellphones  offers  huge  communication  advantages  and  greater
  efficiency. But these advantages have also been recognised by criminals.


  Security  agents  in  turn  make  use  of  cellphones  to  establish  the
  whereabouts of criminals. But this only works  if  the  identity  of  the
  person using the phone  can  be  established  at  all  times.  Hence  the
  suggestion that stolen phones be reported  promptly.  In  addition,  such
  phones should be blacklisted, making them inoperable by criminals.


  The baffling decision by a major cell  network  to  cease  this  practice
  represents a setback in the  fight  against  crime.  South  Africans  are
  notorious for lobbying for strongarm tactics to fight crime. But they are
  frequently unwilling  to  be  inconvenienced  by  the  actions  that  are
  required of them in this fight. This attitude must change if  we  are  to
  roll back this scourge.

I want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  say  a  few  words  of  thanks  and
appreciation, firstly, to Johan Labuschagne from the Department of  Justice,
who was responsible for drafting this Bill and for promoting it through  the
committee. The work done by Johan Labuschagne cannot be  overemphasised.  We
also want to thank our law enforcement and intelligence agencies  for  their
assistance in helping us to draft  this  Bill.  We  convey  our  thanks  and
appreciation also  to  the  telecommunications  service  providers  and,  in
particular, to the Ministry  and  the  Director-General  of  Communications.
Their input into what we have before us was invaluable and they  all  played
a crucial role in crafting this Bill.

Finally, we are convinced of the constitutionality of  this  Bill.  However,
there remains a challenge for both the judiciary and, dare  I  say  it,  the
bench. In this Bill  we  have  new  concepts  like  archived  communication-
related direction, decryption  assistance,  decryption  key  and  real  time
communication-related direction. We look forward to  the  near  and  distant
future to see how our bench deals with such concepts. We commend  this  Bill
to the House. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:   Mr
Chairperson, comrades, friends and colleagues,  firstly,  I  would  like  to
express a word of thanks for a really good debate.

People have, obviously, agonised over the  balance  that  is  required.  Our
Constitutional Court has already concluded that  the  effective  prosecution
of crime is a societal objective of great significance  which  could,  where
appropriate, justify the infringement of fundamental rights.

I would like to suggest that the Bill  is  an  absolute  reflection  of  the
committee's agonising over that balance. It has looked at the issues  around
privacy. It has made exceptions around all the issues  that  pertain  to  an
infringement of that privacy, extremely difficult procedures to  go  through
in order to obtain this so-called infringement of privacy. I think the  Bill
is a reflection of that very balance that is required. We all know  that  in
an ideal world we would not need this Bill and we  know  that  this  is  far
from an ideal world.

So I would really like to  congratulate  the  committee  on  achieving  that
balance which the hon Masutha referred to. I  do  think  that  it  has  been
achieved, and I think it has been agonised over. It is quite clear.

The hon Landers also referred to the  sophistication  of  modern  syndicates
and this is just absolutely true. This piece of legislation is  enabling  in
the sense that it provides some kind of mechanism for  the  law  enforcement
agencies to respond to the very sophisticated mechanisms and ways  in  which
organised crime operates. So in fact,  beyond  the  issue  of  bugging,  so-
called, it is a highly enabling mechanism in an environment where  organised
crime is on the increase.

As this relates to organised crime,  there  is  a  global  perspective.  Our
legal developments have  not  kept  up  with  the  issues  of  technological
advances and other legal systems which have been provided on this  issue  in
different countries. The global nature of organised crime  would  mean  that
South Africa would be the weak link in trying  to  pursue  these  criminals,
and that we could not have.

So it is extremely  important  that  we  have  responded  with  a  piece  of
legislation which, I believe, meets the requirements  of  our  Constitution.
Somebody called for monitoring. I think this should be done. I think  it  is
an excellent suggestion and I am sure the committee will  be  interested  to
know how its legislation is serving the requirement.

I would like to refer to, I think it was, the first  speaker,  hon  Delport,
who, if I understood him correctly, intimated that  because  this  Bill  was
aimed primarily at organised crime, the impact would  not  be  felt  by  the
average person on the street. I would like to suggest  that  the  impact  of
organised crime is so dramatic on average people on the street that,  if  we
manage to use this as a mechanism for breaking the back of organised  crime,
the average person will feel the effect.

Finally, with regard to the cost of the application of this Bill,  the  cost
of not providing this Bill has to be evaluated. If it is not  provided,  the
fight against organised crime will be lost. I do not  think  we  can  afford
that.

The service providers sell a  product  to  the  public.  Although  they  are
engaged in the delivery of a service, they are in the  business  to  make  a
profit. The product, whether we like it or not, lends itself to be used  and
is in fact often used  in  the  commission  of  serious  offences.  We  hold
manufacturers  of  firearms  accountable  for  the  distribution  of   their
products. The principle is exactly the  same  in  respect  of  communication
service providers. If the state has to bear all the costs, taxpayers  across
the board, whether they are users or not, would have to  share  the  burden.
Here we manage, at least, to limit the burden because the burden will be,  I
am sure, passed on to the product user. It  does,  however,  seem  a  little
fairer than an across-the-board application.

I would like to thank the committee for a modern piece of legislation  which
does bring our law enforcement agency into the realms of modern  global  law
enforcement. I would like to thank the committee for presenting  us  with  a
piece of legislation which, I think, meets the  constitutional  requirements
and the safety and security requirements of  our  community.  I  also  would
like to agree with the hon Landers that the response of the bench  to  these
modern concepts and to the  application  of  this  legislation  will  be  an
interesting process to watch. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:
1.    Thirteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  dated
     11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial statements  of  Vote
         24 - Public Service and Administration for the year ended 31  March
         2001 [RP 15-01], reports as follows:


              The Committee studied the Report of  the  Auditor-General  and
              put questions for clarification to the Accounting  Officer  of
              the Department on matters which, according to  the  Committee,
              needed attention.


              After considering written replies  from  the  Department,  the
              Committee took note of steps taken by the  Accounting  Officer
              and staff to fulfil their obligations in terms of  the  Public
              Finance Management Act concerning financial management at  the
              Department. The Committee has resolved not to have  a  hearing
              on the report for the year under review, but  will  await  the
              Auditor-General's Report on the next financial year.


              Having noted the  above,  however,  the  Committee  draws  the
              attention of the Accounting Officer to the following:


              1.  Audit opinion


                  The Committee commends the Accounting  Officer  and  staff
                  of the Department for  the  Auditor-General's  unqualified
                  audit  opinion  on  both  the  financial  and   compliance
                  audits, and trusts that  future  audit  opinions  will  be
                  equally unqualified.


              2.  Shares in State Information Technology Agency (SITA)


                  It is with concern that the Committee took note  that  the
                  transfer of assets and liabilities in exchange for  shares
                  to the State, as contemplated  in  the  State  Information
                  Technology Agency Act, 1998 (Act No. 88 of 1998), had  not
                  yet been finalised and that no shares had been issued.


                  The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Accounting  Officer
                  report to Parliament by 31 October 2002 on  progress  made
                  with transfer of the assets and liabilities.
              3.  Audit Committee


                  The  Committee  expressed  its  concern  that   an   Audit
                  Committee had not been established as at  31  March  2001,
                  and  wishes   to   point   out   that   this   constitutes
                  noncompliance with the Public Finance Management  Act  and
                  could be grounds for financial misconduct.


                  The  Committee  recommends  that   the   Department   take
                  immediate steps  to  address  this  matter,  and  that  it
                  report to Parliament by 31 October 2002 on  progress  made
                  with  the  establishing  of  the   Audit   Committee,   as
                  contemplated  in  section  77  of   the   Public   Finance
                  Management Act.


     Report to be considered.

2.    Fourteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  dated
     11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial statements  of  Vote
         13 - Health for the year ended 31 March 2001 [RP  123-01],  reports
         as follows:


              The Committee studied the Report of  the  Auditor-General  and
              put questions for clarification to the Accounting  Officer  of
              the Department on matters which, according to  the  Committee,
              needed attention.


              After considering written replies  from  the  Department,  the
              Committee took note of  the  steps  taken  by  the  Accounting
              Officer and staff to fulfil their obligations in terms of  the
              Public Finance Management Act concerning financial  management
              at the Department. The Committee has resolved not  to  have  a
              hearing on the report for the  year  under  review,  but  will
              await the Auditor-General's Report on the next financial year.


              Having noted the  above,  however,  the  Committee  draws  the
              attention of the Accounting Officer to the following:


              1.  Audit opinion


                  The Committee commends the Accounting  Officer  and  staff
                  of the Department for  the  Auditor-General's  unqualified
                  audit  opinion  on  both  the  financial  and   compliance
                  audits, and trusts that  future  audit  opinions  will  be
                  equally unqualified.


              2.  Irregular expenditure, R1 893 823
                  The Committee  is  concerned  that  irregular  expenditure
                  amounting to R1 893 823 had  occurred  at  the  Department
                  during  the  year  under  review.   The   Department   has
                  developed and inserted  a  pamphlet  on  AIDS  in  various
                  newspapers. Proper tender procedures were not followed.


                  The Committee strongly emphasises the following:


                  (a)  Procurement procedures are an essential element of  a
                       proper and disciplined control environment and should
                       never be bypassed.


                  (b)  Disciplinary steps such as warnings  and  letters  of
                       warning/reprimand are often insufficient  to  enforce
                       compliance with procurement procedures.


                  (c)   The  Public  Finance  Management  Act  obliges   the
                       Accounting Officer to ensure pro-active  measures  to
                       prevent irregular  expenditure.  Failing  to  do  so,
                       could constitute financial misconduct.


                  The Committee therefore recommends that,  in  addition  to
                  further stepping up its efforts to ensure compliance  with
                  procurement procedures, the Department take the  necessary
                  and  appropriate  disciplinary  measures   against   those
                  responsible.


                  The Committee further recommends that the  Department,  in
                  consultation  with  the  National  Treasury,   report   to
                  Parliament on whether:


                  (a)   The  Accounting  Officer,   upon   discovering   the
                       irregular nature of the expenditure, reported  it  to
                       the  National  Treasury,  as  required   by   section
                       38(1)(g) of the Public Finance Management Act, and in
                       the  monthly  report,   as   required   by   Treasury
                       Regulation 9.1.2.


                  (b)   The  National   Treasury   or   the   Tender   Board
                       investigated the reported irregularity,  and  whether
                       the Department took the necessary steps to ask for ex
                       post facto approval.
              3.  Sarafina II


                  As the Committee is awaiting further  information  on  the
                  above, a separate resolution will be adopted  at  a  later
                  stage.


     Report to be considered.

3.    Fifteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts,  dated
     11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial statements  of  Vote
         1 - Presidency for the  year  ended  31  March  2001  [RP  168-01],
         reports as follows:


              The Committee studied the Report of  the  Auditor-General  and
              put questions for clarification to the Accounting  Officer  of
              the Department on matters which, according to  the  Committee,
              needed attention.


              After considering written replies  from  the  Department,  the
              Committee took note of  the  steps  taken  by  the  Accounting
              Officer and staff to fulfil their obligations in terms of  the
              Public Finance Management Act concerning financial  management
              at the Department. The Committee has resolved not  to  have  a
              hearing on the report for the  year  under  review,  but  will
              await the Auditor-General's Report on the next financial year.


              Having noted the  above,  however,  the  Committee  draws  the
              attention of the Accounting Officer to the following:


              1.  Audit opinion


                  The Committee commends the Accounting  Officer  and  staff
                  of the Department for  the  Auditor-General's  unqualified
                  audit  opinion  on  both  the  financial  and   compliance
                  audits, and trusts that  future  audit  opinions  will  be
                  equally unqualified.
              2.  Unauthorised expenditure, R982 000


                  The Committee took note of  the  unauthorised  expenditure
                  totalling R982 000 during  the  year,  and  expressed  its
                  concern. As  the  expenditure  charged  against  the  Vote
                  exceeded the total amount voted by R982 000,  this  amount
                  is regarded as unauthorised in terms of section 1  of  the
                  Public Finance Management Act. The Committee took note  of
                  the explanation given by the Accounting Officer,  as  well
                  as  of  the  corrective  measures   implemented   by   the
                  Department, and recommends that the amount of R982 000  be
                  authorised  by  Parliament,  in  view  of  the  fact  that
                  corrective preventative measures have been taken.


              3.  Unauthorised expenditure previously reported


                  Expenditure to the amount of R632 000  (1996-97  financial
                  year) and further amounts totalling R1,561 million  (1999-
                  2000 financial year) was reported as unauthorised  by  the
                  Auditor-General. As  the  Committee  is  awaiting  further
                  information from the  Auditor-General  on  these  reported
                  amounts, a recommendation will be made at a later stage.


              4.  Donations
                  The Committee  was  informed  that  an  investigation  was
                  embarked on to trace  all  donor  expenses  incurred  from
                  1998-99 in respect of source documents in order to  ensure
                  that the  correct  surpluses  are  surrendered  to  donors
                  after completion of the projects.


                  The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Accounting  Officer
                  report to Parliament by 31 October 2002 on  progress  with
                  the investigation.

4.    Sixteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts,  dated
     11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial statements  of  Vote
         22 - Provincial and Local Government for the year  ended  31  March
         2001 [RP 132-01], reports as follows:
              The Committee studied the Report of  the  Auditor-General  and
              put questions for clarification to the Accounting  Officer  of
              the Department on matters which, according to  the  Committee,
              needed attention.


              After considering written replies  from  the  Department,  the
              Committee took note of  the  steps  taken  by  the  Accounting
              Officer and staff to fulfil their obligations in terms of  the
              Public Finance Management Act concerning financial  management
              at the Department. The Committee has resolved not  to  have  a
              hearing on the report for the  year  under  review,  but  will
              await the Auditor-General's Report on the next financial year.


     Report to be considered.

5.    Seventeenth Report of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,
     dated 11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial statements  of  Vote
         25 - Public Service Commission (PSC) for the year  ended  31  March
         2001 [RP 128-01], reports as follows:


              The Committee studied the Report of  the  Auditor-General  and
              put questions for clarification to the Accounting  Officer  of
              the PSC on matters which, according to the  Committee,  needed
              attention.


              After considering written replies from the PSC, the  Committee
              took note of the steps taken by  the  Accounting  Officer  and
              staff to fulfil their  obligations  in  terms  of  the  Public
              Finance Management Act concerning  financial  management.  The
              Committee has resolved not to have a hearing on the report for
              the year under review, but will  await  the  Auditor-General's
              Report on the next financial year.


              Having noted the  above,  however,  the  Committee  draws  the
              attention of the Accounting Officer to the following:


              Noncompliance with Treasury Regulations


              The Committee took note of and expressed its concern about the
              PSC having no approved write-off policy  and  about  the  fact
              that the use of  suspense  accounts  not  cleared  each  month
              resulted in noncompliance with Treasury Regulations.


              The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer report to
              Parliament by 31 October 2002 on the necessary steps taken  to
              rectify this matter.


     Report to be considered.

6.    Eighteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  dated
     11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial statements  of  Vote
         27 - South African Management  Development  Institute  (SAMDI)  for
         the year ended 31 March 2001 (as stated in  the  Annual  Report  of
         SAMDI), reports as follows:


              The Committee studied the Report of  the  Auditor-General  and
              put questions for clarification to the Accounting  Officer  on
              matters which, according to the Committee, needed attention.


              After considering written replies from  SAMDI,  the  Committee
              took note of the steps taken by  the  Accounting  Officer  and
              staff to fulfil their  obligations  in  terms  of  the  Public
              Finance Management Act concerning  financial  management.  The
              Committee has resolved not to have a hearing on the report for
              the year under review, but will  await  the  Auditor-General's
              Report on the next financial year.
              Having noted the  above,  however,  the  Committee  draws  the
              attention of the Accounting Officer to the following:


              1.  Audit opinion


                  The Committee commends the Accounting  Officer  and  staff
                  for the Auditor-General's  unqualified  audit  opinion  on
                  both the financial and compliance audits, and trusts  that
                  future audit opinions will be equally unqualified.


              2.  European Union claims


                  The Committee  expressed  its  concern  about  outstanding
                  claims  against  the  European  Union  (EU)  for  services
                  rendered by SAMDI, to the  amount  of  R2,2  million.  The
                  Committee  further  took  note  of  steps  taken  by   the
                  Accounting Officer to speed up the process. The  Committee
                  is concerned that in the event of the EU not settling  the
                  claims, the  expenditure  will  form  an  expense  against
                  voted funds.


                  The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Accounting  Officer
                  immediately  take  the  necessary  steps  to  settle   the
                  outstanding claims by the EU and report to  Parliament  by
                  31 October 2002 on progress made to finalise this matter.


              3.  Audit Committee


                  The  Committee  expressed  its  concern  that   an   Audit
                  Committee had not been established as at  31  March  2001,
                  and pointed out that this constituted non-compliance  with
                  the Public Finance Management Act  and  could  be  grounds
                  for financial misconduct.


                  The Committee recommends that immediate steps be taken  to
                  address this matter, and that SAMDI report  to  Parliament
                  by 31 October 2002 on progress made with the  establishing
                  of the Audit Committee contemplated in section 77  of  the
                  Public Finance Management Act.


              4.  Asset management


                  The Committee took note of the  shortcomings  reported  in
                  the  management  of  assets  and  that  the  accuracy  and
                  completeness  of  the  asset   register   could   not   be
                  determined. The Committee brings to the attention  of  the
                  Accounting Officer that, since the implementation  of  the
                  Public  Finance  Management  Act,  should  there  be   any
                  deficits or surplus stock, it would be the  responsibility
                  of the Accounting Officer.


                  The Committee therefore recommends that:


                  (a)  The Accounting Officer adhere to section 38(1)(d)  of
                       the Public Finance Management  Act  and  to  Treasury
                       Regulation 10.1.
                  (b)  A comprehensive report be submitted to  the  Auditor-
                       General by 31 October  2002  on  progress  made  with
                       regard to the safeguarding of all departmental assets
                       and any remaining future important milestones in this
                       regard.


     Report to be considered.

7.    Nineteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  dated
     11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial  statements  of  the
         South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC)  for  the  financial
         year ended 31 March 2001 [RP 122-01], reports as follows:


              The Committee studied the Report of  the  Auditor-General  and
              put questions for clarification to the Accounting  Officer  on
              matters which, according to the Committee, needed attention.
              After considering written replies, the Committee took note  of
              the steps taken by the Accounting Officer and staff to  fulfil
              their obligations in terms of the  Public  Finance  Management
              Act  concerning  financial  management  at  the   SAMRC.   The
              Committee has resolved not to have a hearing on the report for
              the year under review, but will put  additional  questions  to
              the  Accounting  Officer  on  matters  that   needed   further
              attention.


              Having noted the  above,  however,  the  Committee  draws  the
              attention of the SAMRC to the following:
              Audit opinion


              The Committee commends the Board and staff of  the  SAMRC  for
              the Auditor-General's unqualified audit opinion  on  both  the
              financial and compliance audits, and trusts that future  audit
              opinions will be equally unqualified.
     Report to be considered.

8.    Twentieth Report of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts,  dated
     11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial statements  of  Vote
         30 - Sport and Recreation for the year ended 31 March 2000 [RP 139-
         2000] and the  Report  of  the  Auditor-General  on  the  financial
         statements of Vote 29 - Sport and Recreation for the year ended  31
         March 2001 (as stated in the  Annual  Report  of  the  Department),
         reports as follows:


              The Committee studied the Reports of the  Auditor-General  and
              put questions for clarification to the Accounting  Officer  of
              the Department on matters which, according to  the  Committee,
              needed attention.


              After considering written replies  from  the  Department,  the
              Committee took note of steps taken by the  Accounting  Officer
              and staff to fulfil their obligations in terms of  the  Public
              Finance Management Act concerning financial management at  the
              Department. The Committee has resolved not to have  a  hearing
              on the reports for the years under review, but will await  the
              Auditor-General's Report on the next financial year.


              Having noted the  above,  however,  the  Committee  draws  the
              attention of the Accounting Officer to the following:


              1.  Audit opinion


                  The Committee commends the Accounting  Officer  and  staff
                  of the Department for  the  Auditor-General's  unqualified
                  audit  opinion  on  both  the  financial  and   compliance
                  audits, and trusts that  future  audit  opinions  will  be
                  equally unqualified.


              2.  Internal checking and control


                  The  Committee  acknowledges  the  steps  taken   by   the
                  Accounting Officer to improve the  internal  checking  and
                  control in the Department. However, the Committee,  having
                  noted the  circumstances  under  which  this  took  place,
                  still wishes to emphasise that  the  depositing  of  money
                  into private bank accounts, as was reported  the  previous
                  year, is not allowed under any circumstances.


              3.  Unauthorised expenditure previously reported
                  Expenditure  to  the  amount  of  R822  460,68  (1999-2000
                  financial year) and a further amount of R10 288,69  (2000-
                  01 financial year) was reported  as  unauthorised  by  the
                  Auditor-General. As  the  Committee  is  awaiting  further
                  information from the  Auditor-General  on  these  reported
                  amounts, a recommendation will be made at a later stage.


     Report to be considered.

9.    Twenty-first Report of the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,
     dated 11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial  statements  of  the
         Water Research Commission for the period ended 31  March  2001  (as
         stated in the Annual Report  of  the  Water  Research  Commission),
         reports as follows:


              The Committee studied the Report of  the  Auditor-General  and
              put questions for clarification to the Chief Executive Officer
              on  matters  which,  according  to   the   Committee,   needed
              attention.


              After considering written replies, the Committee took note  of
              the steps taken by the Chief Executive Officer  and  staff  to
              fulfil their  obligations  in  terms  of  the  Public  Finance
              Management  Act  concerning  financial   management   at   the
              Commission. The Committee has resolved not to have  a  hearing
              on the report for the year under review, but  will  await  the
              Auditor-General's Report on the next financial year.


              Having noted the  above,  however,  the  Committee  draws  the
              attention of the Commission to the following:


              1.  Audit opinion


                  The  Committee  commends  the  Board  and  staff  of   the
                  Commission for  the  Auditor-General's  unqualified  audit
                  opinion on both the financial and compliance  audits,  and
                  trusts  that  future  audit  opinions  will   be   equally
                  unqualified.


              2.  Evaluation of financial statements by Audit Committee


                  The  Committee  acknowledges  that  the  Audit   Committee
                  evaluated the financial  statements  for  the  year  under
                  review. However, the  Audit  Committee's  report  was  not
                  included in  the  Annual  Report  of  the  Commission,  as
                  required  (Treasury  Regulation  3.1.13).  The   Committee
                  recommends  that  the  Commission   adhere   to   Treasury
                  Regulations in future.


     Report to be considered.

10.   Twenty-Second Report of the Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,
     dated 11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial  statements  of  the
         Commission on Gender Equality for the  year  ended  31  March  2001
         [RP 165-01], and having considered responses of  the  Acting  Chief
         Executive Officer to the Committee's queries, reports as follows:


         1. Audit opinion
              The Committee commends the Acting Chief Executive Officer  and
              staff of the Commission on the  Auditor-General's  unqualified
              audit opinion on both the financial and compliance audits, and
              trusts that future audit opinions will be equally unqualified.


         2. Forensic investigation


              The Committee  further  commends  the  Commission  for  having
              instituted  a  forensic  investigation  that  resulted  in   a
              disciplinary hearing, the subsequent dismissal  of  the  staff
              member concerned and the  recovery  of  the  amount  of  money
              involved.


              The  Committee  welcomes  the  decision   to   terminate   the
              electronic transfer system of payments, and to revert  to  the
              issuing of cheques for all payments after the authorities have
              properly scrutinised and signed the necessary documents.
              The Committee therefore requests that the Commission furnishes
              it with a report by 31 October 2002, indicating the success or
              otherwise of the new method of payment.


         3. Donor funding


              The Committee  noted  with  concern  that  compared  with  the
              previous financial  year,  the  amount  in  respect  of  donor
              funding received by the Commission during the  financial  year
              under  review  decreased  substantially,  thereby   negatively
              impacting on the Commission's ability to deliver  on  budgeted
              projects.


              The Committee welcomes the Commission's initiative  to  engage
              its traditional donors for continued funding, and requests the
              Commission to furnish it with a progress report by 31  October
              2002.


         4. Asset control


              The Committee is concerned that control  over  assets  at  the
              Commission is unsatisfactory. It noted, however, that physical
              stock-taking of all assets took place, and that users  had  to
              sign for assets under their control.


              The Committee therefore recommends that the Commission  submit
              a formal report to it by 31 October 2002, informing it of  the
              successful implementation of the Commission's policy regarding
              asset control.


         5. Personnel records


              The  Committee  noted  with  concern  that  certain  pay-roll,
              personnel and leave records were  either  not  updated  or  in
              certain instances did not even exist.


              The Committee noted, however, that all staff  files  have  now
              been  updated,  and   that   the   Commission   is   currently
              streamlining the files of all the Commissioners.
              The Committee therefore recommends that  a  formal  report  be
              submitted to it by 31 October 2002, showing the completion  of
              updating and streamlining the process.


         6. Disaster Recovery Plan


              The Committee is concerned at the absence of a formal disaster
              recovery plan or a business continuity plan.


              The Committee noted the unsuccessful corrective steps and  the
              temporary nature of the back-up  measures  instituted  by  the
              Commission.


              The Committee requests that the Commission urgently institutes
              a comprehensive disaster recovery plan and furnish it  with  a
              progress report thereon by 31 October 2002.


         7. Internal audit


              The Committee noted that the  Commission  had  outsourced  its
              internal audit function, but that internal auditors  have  now
              been appointed.


              Nevertheless, the Committee is concerned that no final reports
              were available for review and that, consequently, no  reliance
              could be placed on the internal audit function.


              The Committee requests that the Commission furnish it  with  a
              progress report on this matter by 31 October 2002.
     Report to be considered.

11.   Twenty-Third Report of the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,
     dated 11 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial statements  of  Vote
         27 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism for the year ended 31  March
         2001 [RP 115-01], reports as follows:


              The Committee studied the Report of  the  Auditor-General  and
              forwarded preliminary questions for clarity to the  Accounting
              Officer of the Department on matters which, according  to  the
              Committee, needed attention.


              Having considered written replies, the Committee took note  of
              steps taken by the Accounting  Officer  and  staff  to  fulfil
              their obligations in terms of the  Public  Finance  Management
              Act concerning financial management  at  the  Department.  The
              Committee has resolved not to have a hearing on the report for
              the year under review, but will  await  the  Auditor-General's
              Report on the next financial year.


              Noting the above, however, the Committee wishes to  bring  the
              following matters to the attention of the Accounting Officer:


              1.  Audit opinion


                  The Committee commends the Accounting  Officer  and  staff
                  of the Department for  the  Auditor-General's  unqualified
                  audit  opinion  on  both  the  financial  and   compliance
                  audits, and trusts that  future  audit  opinions  will  be
                  equally unqualified.


              2.  Unauthorised expenditure, R673 248 [par 3.4, p 18]


                  The Committee is concerned that  unauthorised  expenditure
                  amounting to R673  248  had  occurred  at  the  Department
                  during  the  1999-2000  financial  year.  The   Department
                  overspent this amount on a contract for the supply of  Y2K
                  services during the said year. They applied  for  ex  post
                  facto approval on 31 January  2000,  but  the  application
                  was turned down by the State  Tender  Board  on  18  April
                  2000.  This  amount  is  only  shown  as  a  note  in  the
                  management report, and is not disclosed in  the  financial
                  statements for the year ended 31 March 2001,  as  required
                  by Treasury Regulation 9.1.5.


                  The  Committee  noted  the  explanation  provided  in  the
                  replies, dated 30 January 2002, and  wishes  to  emphasise
                  the following:


                  (a)  Given the  high  reliance  placed  by  Parliament  on
                       information contained in the financial statements and
                       the notes thereto, the Accounting Officer must at all
                       times ensure that these are accurate and complete.


                  (b)   Appropriate  corrective  steps,  which  may  include
                       disciplinary  steps  and/or  enhancing   of   control
                       measures,  should  be  taken  in  each  instance   of
                       unauthorised or irregular expenditure,  in  order  to
                       prevent a recurrence of similar incidents.


                  However, given the context presented by the replies of  30
                  January 2002 and the assurance by the  Accounting  Officer
                  that value was received for the  money  spent,  and  given
                  the fact that the State suffered no  loss,  the  Committee
                  recommends  that  Parliament  approve   the   unauthorised
                  expenditure.


              3.  Joint Paymaster-General Account


                  In paragraph 3.1 on page 3 of the previous Report  of  the
                  Auditor-General [RP 120-2000], it was  reported  that  the
                  Department  still  shared  a  bank  account  and   warrant
                  voucher series with  the  Marine  Living  Resources  Fund.
                  This practice hampers control over and  administration  of
                  the accounting system of the two entities.


                  Furthermore, a tender was awarded to  ABSA  Bank  for  the
                  provision  of  banking  services  for  the  Marine  Living
                  Resources Fund. At the time of adoption  of  this  Report,
                  the bank account was not yet operational due to  technical
                  problems.


                  The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Accounting  Officer
                  report to Parliament by no later than 30 November 2002  on
                  this matter.


              4.  Follow-up computer audits  of  general  controls  in  head
                  office and weather bureau environments


                  The computer audits revealed a number  of  weaknesses  and
                  lack of control measures, as outlined on pages  15  to  18
                  of   the   Auditor-General's   Report   [RP 115-01].   The
                  Committee is satisfied with  the  replies  of  30  January
                  2002, which refer to corrective steps taken or planned.


                  The  Committee,  however,  notes  with  concern  that  the
                  Fisheries Resource System has 350 users and  is  used  for
                  the  issuing  of  valuable  boat  and  fishing   licences,
                  permits and levies paid on fish caught.  The  total  value
                  of these amounts to about R13,7 million per year.  In  the
                  replies it was indicated  that  a  comprehensive  security
                  policy was being developed in consultation with SITA.


                  The Committee recommends that a copy of the  policy,  once
                  finalised,  be  furnished  to  the   Auditor-General   for
                  review, and that a brief report be  tabled  in  Parliament
                  by the end of November 2002, providing assurance that  the
                  necessary  corrective  steps  have  been  implemented   to
                  address areas of risk, such as possible fraud or  loss  of
                  confidential data.


              5.  Use of government credit card by former Deputy Minister


                  The Committee noted with  concern  that  this  matter  has
                  been outstanding for an unduly long period of time.


                  The Committee recommends that an  indication  be  obtained
                  from the Public Protector by the Accounting  Officer,  and
                  provided to Parliament by 30  November  2002,  on  when  a
                  final report  could  be  expected  or  on  any  subsequent
                  developments that may have an impact on the matter.


     Report to be considered.
