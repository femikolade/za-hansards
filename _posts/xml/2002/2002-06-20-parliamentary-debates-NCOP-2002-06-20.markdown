                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a point of order:  Is  it  parliamentary
for  members  to  wear  traditional  farmers'  clothing  during  a  sitting?
[Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Are there members wearing traditional  farmers'
clothing? I do not note any members. I see members dressed  in  their  usual
peculiar way. [Laughter.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter,  ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting van die Raad gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem, saam met die Noord-Kaap en die hele Suid-Afrika, dat -


       (a)  die DA gister in Kimberley, die parlementêre  hoofstad  van  die
           Noord-Kaap, in 'n tussenverkiesing vernietig is;


       (b)  die steun van die DA van  1  048  stemme  in  2000  na  net  137
           getuimel het, en dat selfs die onafhanklike kandidaat byna  drie
           keer meer stemme op hom gevestig het as die DA; en


       (c)  hierdie uitslag op die vooraand van die oorloopgeleentheid  weer
           eens 'n bewys is dat die DA se steun besig is om te kwyn, en dat
           dit nie 'n tuiste bied nie vir denkende kiesers wat nie net  wil
           raas en blaas nie, maar ook 'n verskil in Suid-Afrika  wil  maak
           en deel van die hoofstroompolitiek wil wees; en ...
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move -


  That the Council -


  (1) notes, together with the Northern Cape and the whole of South Africa,
       that -


       (a)  the DA was annihilated in a by-election yesterday in  Kimberley,
           the parliamentary capital of the Northern Cape;


       (b)  the support for the DA plummeted from 1 048  votes  in  2000  to
           only 137 and that even the  independent  candidate  drew  nearly
           three times more votes than the DA; and


       (c)  this result on the eve of the floor-crossing event  proves  once
           again that support for the DA is dwindling, and that it does not
           offer a home to thinking voters who do not only want to huff and
           puff, but who also want to make a difference in South Africa and
           who want to be part of mainstream politics; and]


  (2) further notes that it is time for South Africans under the DA  banner
       to become proud South Africans or remain partial South Africans under
       the leadership of Tony Leon in the DA, the Defeated Alliance.

[Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is it parliamentary for members  to  wear  hats
in the House?

Ms M P  THEMBA:  Chairperson,  yes,  women  can  wear  hats  in  the  House.
[Laughter.]

I give notice that I shall move at the next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Department of Land  Affairs  has  launched  a  massive
       manhunt for 1 000 to 1 500  German  nationals  who  came  into  South
       Africa on tourist visas during the past three years  but  have  never
       left;


  (2) further notes that  they  are  now  suspected  of  being  part  of  a
       syndicate which brings European nationals  into  South  Africa  where
       they are promised a good lifestyle and jobs in foreign companies;


  (3) also notes that some of them are wanted in Germany for  tax  evasion,
       and that some  have  set  up  small  shops  claiming  that  they  are
       investing in South Africa;
  (4) commends the department for tracking down some of these  supposed-to-
       be tourists who are currently facing charges and deportation; and


  (5) believes that we cannot allow  people  to  disrespect  the  country's
       immigration laws and do as they please.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the ANC has  scored  a  significant  victory  in  the  by-
       elections that took place in Roodepan in the Northern Cape ...

This is my constituency -


  (2) further notes that it is the first time the ANC  has  won  this  ward
       which was traditionally controlled by opposition candidates; and


  (3) congratulates the ANC candidate on his emphatic victory.

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I give notice that I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) echoes the sentiments of our President, the hon Thabo Mbeki, when  he
       said in the National Assembly yesterday:


         ``Farmers and Boers are as much South African and African as I  am,
         entitled to the same rights and privileges that are enjoyed by  any
         other South African.''; and


         ``Nobody, anywhere in our country, whoever they are,  has  a  right
         to call for the killing of any South African, whatever the  colour,
         race, ethnic origin, gender or health  condition  of  the  intended
         victim ... nobody, whoever they are, has the right to call for  the
         killing of farmers or Boers, nor the right to threaten violence  to
         advance their particular goals.''; and


  (2) unequivocally ratifies the call by the hon Mosiuoa  Lekota,  Minister
       of Defence  and  former  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,  in  this  House
       yesterday that hon members should use their  reconciliatory  role  to
       prevent inflammatory statements, sentiments  and  actions  which  can
       cause polarisation between the various communities of South Africa.

Me E C GOUWS: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  van die tussenverkiesing wat  in  die  Kamdeboo  Munisipaliteit,
           Graaff-Reinet-gebied, plaasgevind het;


       (b)  van die groei in stemme vir die DA van 12% tot 25% in 'n wyk wat
           deur die ANC oorheers word; en


       (c)   dat  die  uitslag  kenmerkend  is  van  die  DA  se  groei   in
           tradisioneel swart gebiede; en


  (2) die sinspeling dat daar agteruitgang in die DA is, met die  minagting
       wat dit verdien, verwerp.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of -


       (a)  the by-election which took place in the Kamdeboo Municipality in
           the Graaff-Reinet area;


       (b)  the increase in votes for the DA from  12%  to  25%  in  a  ward
           dominated by the ANC; and


       (c)  the fact that the result is characteristic of the DA's growth in
           traditionally black areas; and


  (2) rejects the allusion that there is a  decline  in  the  DA  with  the
       contempt it deserves.

Mr  A  E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Grashalm,   suster,   grashalm!   [Gelag.]   Laaste
stuiptrekkings! [Straw, sister, straw! [Laughter.] Last convulsions!]

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -
  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)   die  Wit  Huis  en  die  Senaat  in  Amerika  onlangs  in  nuwe
           terreurwetgewing    voorsiening    gemaak    het     vir     die
           beskikbaarstelling van fondse, veral aan Afrika-lande,  vir  die
           bestryding van Vigs;


       (b)  president George Bush Woensdag, 19 Junie 2002, bekend gemaak het
           dat die VSA 500 miljoen  dollar,  ongeveer  R5,1  miljard,  gaan
           skenk om die oordrag van Vigs van moeder na kind te bestry;


       (c)  Suid-Afrika een van die agt Afrika-lande is wat gaan  baat  vind
           by die skenking; en


       (d)  die Nuwe NP, hoewel die omvang van die skenking aan  Suid-Afrika
           nog nie bekend is nie, die aankondiging verwelkom omdat die Nuwe
           NP glo dat dit binne die vermoë van Suid-Afrika is om die fondse
           doeltreffend aan te wend; en
  (2) 'n beroep doen op die res van die internasionale wêreld om die VSA se
       voorbeeld te volg.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the  White  House  and  the  Senate  in  America  recently  made
           provision in new terrorism legislation for the release of funds,
           mainly to African countries for the combating of Aids;


       (b)  President George Bush announced on Wednesday, 19 June 2002, that
           the  USA  will  donate  500  million  dollars  to   combat   the
           transmission of Aids from mother to child;
       (c)  South Africa is one of the eight African  countries  which  will
           benefit from the donation; and


       (d)  although the extent of the donation to South Africa is  not  yet
           known, the New National Party welcomes the announcement  as  the
           New National Party believes that it is  within  the  ability  of
           South Africa to utilise the funds effectively; and


  (2) appeals to the rest of the international world to  follow  the  USA's
       example.

    CALL TO DESIST FROM USING SLOGANS THAT UNDERMINE NATION-BUILDING AND
                               RECONCILIATION

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  nation-building and reconciliation are central to the ethos  and
           aspirations of our democratic constitutional dispensation; and


       (b)  our constitution  guarantees  protection  to  all  sections  and
           sectors of our nation;


  (2) recognises  that  farmers,  industrialists,  workers  and  all  other
       sectors collectively contribute directly to the  development  of  our
       economy  and  are  collectively   responsible   for   the   country's
       reconstruction and transformation;


  (3) further notes that, if  repeated,  certain  slogans  and  utterances,
       including the slogan "Kill the Boer, kill the Farmer", can result  in
       the alienation of a significant section of our nation;


  (4) resolves that such slogans and utterances are inimical to undermining
       nation-building and reconciliation; and


  (5) calls on all persons to desist from  perpetuating  such  slogans  and
       utterances in the future.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    POOR SPORTMANSHIP EXHIBITED BY ITALY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the chairman of the  Italian  Serie  A  club  Perugia  has
       summarily  fired  Korea's  ``golden  boy''  Ahn  Jung-Hwan,  who  was
       responsible for scoring the golden goal for Korea in the second-round
       match against Italy, the early World Cup favourites;


  (2) expresses its disgust at such an unsporting decision; and


  (3) deplores the failure of Italians to accept  the  result  of  a  great
       soccer match played at the World Cup finals.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to  that  motion?
There is an objection. The motion will therefore become notice of a motion.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  King Zwelithini will celebrate 30 years on the Zulu  throne  co-
           inciding with his birthday on 26 July 2002; and


       (b)  for the past 30 years the King has become  a  symbol  of  peace,
           justice, prosperity and stability among the Zulus,  and  he  has
           played a major role in keeping the nation intact and  preserving
           its values; and


  (2) hopes that through this foundation a living legacy of the  King  will
       be sustained.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 25 - Agriculture:

Vote No 29 - Land Affairs:

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson,  I  would
just like to explain why I am appearing here before the House today. As  hon
members know, today is the day on which the Budget Votes of the  departments
come before the National Assembly. There was an instruction  that  Ministers
be present there. That is why my Minister cannot be here, and  I  offer  her
apologies for this problem, which is basically out of  the  control  of  the
Ministry.

I must say that I do appreciate one thing, which is  the  presence  here  of
six  MECs  for  agriculture.  I  might  be  wrong  as  I  may  have  counted
incorrectly. There is Mr Gelderblom as well.  This  is,  indeed,  a  day  of
provincial Ministers of agriculture. The main purpose for me here  today  is
to take close note, from the side of the  national  Ministry,  of  what  the
provincial Ministers are going to tell us today and the  subjects  they  are
concerned about. I can promise the House that we will  get  it  through  and
make a record available for ourselves of  these  proceedings,  and  take  it
very seriously.

I would like to  start  first  with  the  agricultures.  There  is  a  basic
democratic problem. I think  that  in  two  main  points  I  can  bring  the
agricultural problem which we  have  to  the  fore.  The  one  side  of  the
agricultural problem, which we must address,  is  also  part  of  the  basic
democratic problem. Since the end of the Second World  War  there  has  been
continued  and  far  more  intensive  political  steerage  of  socioeconomic
problems, and there are always  complaints  about  how  things  pan  out  in
practice a democracy.

We have a continual  analysis  of  the  problems  of  legitimacy  in  modern
democracies. We have a mounting awareness of national, regional  and  global
crises which are, especially in the agricultural sector, coming to the  fore
all the more, especially if we think about  the  food  security  crisis  all
over the globe.

I think the basic democratic problem, which is also the basic  problem  from
the viewpoint of agriculture governance in South Africa, is to be faced,  on
the one hand, by the claims for participation in the governing systems  and,
on the other hand, by claims of efficiency - to  make  things  work  and  to
maintain an integrating capacity for action. That, I  think,  is  the  basic
democratic problem.

It is very easy in an autocratic state, in which you  have  a  dictator  and
someone like Goebbels, to say, ``Ein volk, ein  Deutschland,  ein  Führer''.
That is very easy. One nation, one leader. One  does  not  have  integration
problems in that situation. This is at the heart of the  democratic  problem
and it is also the problem which we have to face  in  agriculture.  That  is
why this institution  is  so  important  -  to  get  that  into  integrating
capacity for action.

What is also important is the quality  of  the  participation.  I  think  we
still have a lot to do in that field. The  quality  of  one's  participatory
systems - like we have with the national and  provincial  systems  and  also
with the local governmental systems - should be measured by  the  manner  in
which decisions at every level influence or modify action at  other  levels;
the way in which decisions at local level influence national  decisions,  in
which  provincial  decisions  influence  national  and  in  which   national
decisions influence local and provincial decisions.

Those  influences  of  the  decisions  are  the  real   measure   in   which
circumstances are altered for a better life for  one's  citizens.  I  submit
that that is the basic problem which must addressed and  that  is  also  the
basic problem of agricultural governance in South Africa - this  integrating
for co-ordinated action.

The second aspect which the speech addresses of the Minister, which  I  will
make available immediately after  I  have  finished  -  including  the  Land
Affairs speech for the speakers in this debate - is the  underestimation  of
the role of agriculture in national economies. I  would  like  to  hear  the
provincial Ministers on that matter.
It has been demonstrated that the surest  way  in  which  one  can  increase
one's Gross National Product is  by  increasing  agricultural  productivity.
Nothing comes close to that. It has  been  proven  that  by  putting  up  or
growing agricultural productivity, one stimulates growth,  generates  income
and reduces poverty like no other governmental  intervention  can  do.  This
has been proven by research.

One's growth in agriculture  resulting  from  yield-increasing  technologies
has possibly the highest multiplier effects on overall economic  growth.  In
some of the studies that have been done this has been  two  to  three  times
more than the initial agricultural growth rate.

For example, research done  in  India  has  shown  that  when  one  promotes
agricultural growth of all the  possible  governmental  interventions,  this
has a larger economic impact on economic growth in general than spending  on
other  rural  programmes.  The  second  factor  which   comes   closest   to
agriculture is spending on rural roads - this, by the way,  has  been  found
to be the case in India - followed  by  irrigation,  rural  electrification,
soil and water conservation, education and then health. The  highest  effect
on coping with rural poverty is, for me, at the heart of the  matter;  these
two questions: co-ordination on the one hand and growing agriculture on  the
other hand.

I personally believe that if Africa is to overcome its  poverty,  this  will
happen through being based on  agricultural  development,  and  recovery  in
Africa must be led by agriculture and nothing else.  Thereafter,  the  other
things can follow.

Regarding the budget, in the year under review before hon  members  we  have
been seeing the results of  key  policy  changes  that  our  Government  has
implemented. The main elements of  that  have  been  to  broaden  access  to
agriculture and, secondly, to make agriculture more  representative  of  the
South African population. What this has meant for those  of  us  working  in
agriculture  governance  is  that  all  our   departments   nationally   and
provincially simply have to reposition themselves to align their  work  more
and more.
If we have the common objective - and I know that cuts across all parties  -
of bettering the lives of our people, that is the only way that we  can  go,
namely to align our work and work together far more than we we have done  in
the past.

What are our strategic goals? From the side of  the  national  Ministry  and
the department I will quote them for hon members quickly. They  are  in  the
speech that hon members will get as soon as I  am  finished,  which  members
can then read at their leisure. The first goal is to  promote  equal  access
to resources; secondly, to enhance global competitiveness and  profitability
in  agriculture;  thirdly,  to  ensure  sustainable  natural  resource  use;
fourthly, to promote new entrants to the sector;  and,  fifthly,  to  ensure
consumer confidence.

It does not help to have a very nice strategy and very  beautiful  documents
with nice words, because where the implementation  must  happen  is  at  the
provincial level, as the provincial Ministers and members of the  NCOP  know
very well. That is where it really must happen and South Africa  depends  on
the provincial activities to make this true.
What we need is a diversity of approaches to the delivery  of  services.  We
cannot just do this in one single, linear  way.  We  need  an  alignment  of
approaches and we need a common set of  measurable  indicators  to  do  this
work. There have been various initiatives in South Africa in the year  under
consideration. The most important, perhaps, is the strategic plan for  South
African agriculture.

There is a purpose for wearing these shirts today. I hope  every  member  of
the NCOP will get one so that they can  do  their  rural  constituency  work
very well. I am sure this can be  arranged.  They  must  just  come  to  the
dinner. [Laughter.] The message is on these caps and shirts and that is  the
basic purpose of  this  strategic  plan  for  agriculture  -  a  united  and
prosperous agricultural sector. United and prosperous.

I think that is our aim, and it has to be effected in South Africa. Much  of
this plan is  thanks  to  the  President  personally  who  actually  invited
industry, the national department,  the  agricultural  unions,  Agri-SA  and
Narfu, to draw up this common agricultural vision, which it really is.

I must say that my Minister thanks these unions. She  thanks  academics  who
were involved in this plan, and the officials  at  all  levels  and  in  all
spheres who played a role in the drafting of this  plan.  What  this  sector
plan shows is the interrelationship which needs to exist  between  the  many
arms of our Government and the other parastatals that are involved  in  this
sector. This will require us to change the way we plan, to  change  the  way
we operate and to change the way we evaluate the  work  of  our  departments
nationally, provincially and locally.

I must just say that the implementation plan of  the  strategy  has  already
been drafted, finalised and presented to the President. I  believe  that  it
has also been tabled to the select committee of the NCOP.

Let me just say the most important thing. We need to have these  initiatives
succeed; to have them work. We need to align and co-ordinate  not  only  the
functions of the different departments of agriculture,  but  also  to  align
the budgets of these different departments.

We must move towards the  concept  of  a  consolidated  agriculture  budget,
which expresses this  co-operation  and  this  co-ordination  without  which
agriculture cannot succeed in  South  Africa.  I  would  like  to  hear  the
reactions of  the  Ministers  to  this,  and  then  we  can  start  building
agriculture in South Africa and worldwide.

If one looks at the budget itself,  one  will  see  a  few  changes  in  the
structure. The number of programmes has increased from six to eight. We  now
identify trade and business development as separate from  economic  research
and statistics.

What is really not a  happy  story  is  the  way  in  which  the  budget  of
agriculture nationally has grown. If one looks at the budget one  would  see
that is has grown by an annual average of nearly 7% from the 1998-99  budget
to that of 2001-02.

However, this is misleading. At  the  beginning  of  2001-02,  a  three-year
annual allocation of R85 million was  included  in  that  budget.  This  was
intended to restore and rehabilitate agricultural land and  assets  held  by
communities in Limpopo province and Mpumalanga after  the  floods  of  2000.
This distorts the picture. If one discounts that allocation, the  budget  of
our department has only grown by 3,4% a year from  1998-99  to  2001-02.  In
other words, if one works it out it is an average  of  1,3%  in  the  medium
term by which the budget has grown.

I must be honest with hon members: that is not  enough.  If  we  acknowledge
the importance of agricultural development to the growth of our  economy  as
a whole and as a way to escape from poverty - as I think the  Minister  from
KwaZulu-Natal  will  tell  us  today  -  we  need  bigger  growth   in   our
agricultural budgets all over South Africa. I want to  plead  for  that.  We
have to continue to exert pressure in the fiscal review  process  to  effect
this. It must be our joint and united purpose to  direct  agriculture  where
it should go.
Let me make a few comments on land affairs. Here, as  well,  the  speech  of
the Minister will be  made  available  to  the  House  as  soon  as  I  have
finished. I think I have enough copies for all the speakers in  the  debate.
What are we seeing in land affairs? In land affairs, in general,  we  see  a
very clear  and  relatively  even  pattern  of  delivery  in  all  nine  our
provinces - if  one  looks  at  the  expenditure,  how  expenditure  of  our
allocated budget is being run.

We see an increase in projects of good quality in all  the  provinces.  This
has  been  achieved  in  the  Department  of  Land  Affairs  by   a   rather
comprehensive re-engineering and simplification of the procedures which  are
being utilised by the department. This was a difficult process.

I  could  perhaps  also  just  mention  the  decentralisation  of   delivery
measures, which, as the Minister indicated in her budget speech  last  year,
were critical, unnecessary interventions for getting this delivery.

In other words, what are we saying? I am saying that the Department of  Land
Affairs has responded strongly, positively and effectively to the call  made
by South African citizens to increase the pace  of  delivery.  This  can  be
demonstrated now, and it has not ended there.  We  have  also  improved  the
quality of the delivery, as demonstrated both in terms  of  the  restitution
claims settled and in terms of  redistribution  projects  finalised  in  the
previous year.

In the case of restitution, I think we have kept the  promise  to  focus  on
rural claims and thus increase our coverage of rural poor communities.

In terms of redistribution, on the  other  hand,  the  launch  of  the  Land
Redistribution for Agricultural Development programme, LRAD, heralded a  new
era in  which  land  redistribution  is  part  and  parcel  of  agricultural
development, which is fundamentally the correct  approach,  thus  addressing
both rural food security as well as income generation. I maintain that  this
is the best way to go forward with rural development.

I think we stand to do even better in the new financial  year.  With  regard
to ensuring that the momentum of the previous year is kept up, I  think  the
Department of Land Affairs is making major strides in areas  in  which  they
were weak. Those areas were capacity-building and the  management  of  their
human resources. In terms of restitution,  we  are  looking  forward  to  an
increased pace of delivery as we move towards the finalisation  of  the  big
exercise of validating all land claims.

We also expect the delivery of LRAD to pick up  pace.  As  we  go  into  the
final phase of putting in place the delivery of  the  necessary  legislation
and policies, we expect more activity from another big area of  activity  in
the department, namely spatial planning  and  information.  As  hon  members
know, since the National Land Tenure Conference, which was held in  November
last year in Durban, decisive steps have been taken towards  addressing  the
critical and  difficult  questions  in  the  area  of  land  tenure  reform,
especially in the community areas and also in the commercial farming areas.

Our framework  for  delivery  in  the  field  of  land  affairs  is  clearly
reflected in  the  multiyear  strategic  plan  of  the  Department  of  Land
Affairs, which has also been tabled before this House.

Madam Chair, I am not sure how  much  time  I  have  left.  I  do  have  the
speeches available in writing.  Perhaps  it  would  be  best  now  to  start
listening to what the provincial Ministers and  the  other  members  of  the
NCOP have to say. I believe I have  taken  more  than  20  minutes  already.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Thank you, Deputy  Minister.  Of  course
the matter of time is at my discretion entirely,  but  in  this  instance  I

Elijah Mohammed was correct when he said:


  Man depends on land for the necessities, food, clothing and  shelter  for
  survival. A prime requisite for freedom and independence is having  one's
  own land. There can be no freedom without a people having their own land.

One of the major challenges the advent of democracy presented  this  ANC-led
Government with was that of addressing the legacy of the 1913 land  Act.  We
are challenged,  on  the  one  hand,  to  fast-track  our  land  and  reform
programme, whilst, on the  other  hand,  ensuring  sustainable  development.
Realising the  precarious  balance,  we  have  to  address  poverty,  ensure
equitable  distribution  of  land  ownership  and  also  contribute   to   a
prosperous and peaceful new future for this country.

As we engage in this, we are heeding President  Mbeki's  injunction  in  his
state-of-the-nation address this year to lend  a  hand  and  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty in order to expand access to a better life.

This revered House commends the hon Minister and her  department  for  their
policies and key objectives to ensure access and to promote  and  protect  a
system of land rights suitable for  South  Africa's  conditions,  challenges
and development. They have done so by transforming the  Department  of  Land
Affairs to provide for the following functions: surveys and  mapping;  deeds
registration; the surveyor-general; land development planning; land  reform,
which includes  restitution,  redistribution  and  tenure  reform;  and  the
management of state land.

In  August  2001  the  Land  Redistribution  for  Agricultural   Development
programme, LRAD, was launched in Mpumalanga to provide a framework  for  the
new policy shift in Government's land reform programme,  and  at  which  241
title deeds were handed over to LRAD recipients.

The  strategic  objectives  of  the  Land  Redistribution  for  Agricultural
Development  programme  include  facilitating  the  transfer   of   30%   of
agricultural land over 15 years; to assist historically disadvantaged  black
communities  to  buy  land  or  agricultural  implements,  specifically  for
agricultural purposes; to improve the nutrition  and  income  of  the  rural
poor by raising levels of production; and to expand opportunities for  rural
women and youth. This will be done in the form of government  grants,  which
will be provided in accordance with specific criteria.  This  programme  was
indeed one of our major achievements for 2001-02.

The  department  has  also  convened  a  conference   to   consolidate   and
rationalise legislation  on  tenure  reform  through  the  drafting  of  the
Communal Land Rights Bill, which will be before Parliament  in  August  this
year. Moreover, it is at present drafting legislation on national land  use,
spatial planning, spatial information and the planning profession, which  is
also to be tabled before Parliament this year, in  September.  In  addition,
the department has drafted  standard  eviction  procedures  to  prevent  and
resolve unlawful land invasions and unlawful evictions.

With regard to land reform,  Government  has  made  huge  strides.  This  is
highlighted  by  the  36%  allocation  over  the   medium-term   expenditure
framework  years  on  this  programme.  This  is  one  of  the   challenging
programmes owing to the competing rights  that  are  inherent  in  the  land
where the claim is. We support the hon Minister in her discussions with  the
parties involved. Moreover,  we  appreciate  the  increase  in  spending  on
provincial offices to deal with this particular  challenge.  To  date,  more
than  5 000  claims  have  been  settled  in  Mpumalanga  and  KwaZulu-Natal
respectively, with the rest of the claims received still being validated.

The process involving restitution presented problems of its  own  initially,
but in the period between April 2001 to March this year  we  have  witnessed
unprecedented heightened activity in delivery. During this period  all  nine
provinces have had handing-over ceremonies  virtually  every  week.  In  the
Limpopo province,  eight  large  community  claims  were  settled,  and  the
Northern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal distinguished themselves  with  the  largest
numbers of  hectares  to  date,  namely  221 759  and  61 691  respectively,
involving high-quality land.

Mpumalanga, too, also came to the party, making impressive progress  despite
having a relatively new office. Moreover,  all  the  provinces  have  posted
considerable progress and  the  figures  are  available  at  the  provincial
offices.

In fact, President Mbeki alluded to this during  his  state  of  the  nation
address to Parliament this year. I quote:


  The pace has dramatically increased in the case of land restitution, with
  48 claims settled at the end of 1998; while by the end of 2001 the  total
  number of settlements has increased to 29 000 ... We intend,  within  the
  next three years, to complete the land restitution process,  which  is  a
  critical part of our land reform programme.

We are therefore confident that once this  process  is  turned  around,  the
foundations for local economic development will have been laid.

This House also applauds the  hon  Minister  and  her  department  on  their
departmental human resource policy and their workplace  skills  plan,  which
were designed to improve service delivery. We also acknowledge the role  the
Land  Bank  has  played  in  giving  special  attention  to  the  needs   of
historically disadvantaged communities in terms  of  empowerment,  capacity-
building, and financial and technical assistance in order  for  them  to  be
able to utilise the land  productively.  This  would  enable  them  even  to
contribute to the country's Gross Domestic Product.

In  conclusion,  we  would  like  to  invoke  the  call  by  our  President,
Vukuzenzele - tsoga o itirele [rise up and act], because  Government  cannot
do all of this. There is a role and space for everybody,  the  civil  organs
of  society,  the  private  sector,  donor  organisations,  and  local   and
provincial governments.

[Rev P MOATSHE: A Motswana says that a job becomes easier when  many  people
lend their assistance. He again says that people should  avoid  asking  from
others and work for themselves.

I would like to thank my committee on land affairs; the department  that  is
working with us at all times; the MECs from the provinces; the  chairpersons
of committees in the provinces; the Minister and  the  Deputy  Minister  and
the hon Ngoxi and his army that challenged those who have land  so  that  it
should be returned to its rightful owners. [Applause.]]
Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, hon Minister, the Elandskloof  community  was
the first in South Africa to  have  ancestral  land  restored  by  the  Land
Claims Court in terms of the Restitution of Land  Rights  Act  of  1994.  In
October 1996 the court ratified the claim of the community, which  had  been
evicted 34 years previously by the apartheid government.

In terms of the settlement the Government bought 3 138 hectares of  land  in
the Clanwilliam district for almost R4  million  from  a  white  farmer  and
returned it to the community. Each of the 308 families  entitled  to  settle
on the land also obtained a R15 000 settlement grant.

Maar dit is nie so mooi soos wat  dit  klink  nie,  want  vandag,  vyf  jaar
later,  is  daar  geweldige  probleme  in  hierdie  Elandskloofgebied.   Die
natuurlike plantegroei daar sluit boegoe in. Van die probleme wat die  mense
daar ondervind, is byvoorbeeld die grensgeskille, dit wil  sê  geskille  oor
waar die grenslyne lê. Daar is ook mense  wat  plase  stroop,  maar  ek  sal
netnou daarna terugkom. Ek wil agb lede eers vertel van  boegoe,  en  hoekom
ek glo dat die Minister se departement 'n belangrike bydrae  kan  lewer  tot
die verbou van boegoe in die Wes-Kaap. (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[However, all is not as well as it seems,  because  today,  five  years  on,
there are enormous problems in the Elandskloof area. The natural  vegetation
there includes buchu. Some of the problems experienced by the  people  there
include the boundary  disputes,  in  other  words,  disputes  regarding  the
locality of borderlines. There are also people who are stripping farms,  but
I will come back to that in a moment. I  first  want  to  tell  hon  members
about buchu and why I believe that the Minister's  department  can  make  an
important contribution to the cultivation of buchu in the Western Cape.]

The only place in the world where  buchu  grows  is  in  the  Western  Cape,
mainly in the area from Somerset West to Clanwilliam, and up to  Swellendam.
The biggest buchu business in the world is  at  the  Waterfall  Health  Farm
near Paarl.
Boegoe  het  spesifieke  temperatuur-   en   habitatvereistes,   byvoorbeeld
bergagtige, onbemeste grond wat oor goeie dreinering beskik. Van  die  sowat
180 endemiese boegoespesies landwyd, word twee spesies  kommersieel  ontgin,
maar al die boegoespesies is tot beskermde flora verklaar. Dit  beteken  dat
mense nie sonder 'n spesiale permit of lisensie boegoe mag pluk, vervoer  of
uitvoer nie.

Boegoe is een van die Wes-Kaap se belangrikste plantuitvoerprodukte, met  'n
geraamde omset van minstens R40 miljoen per jaar. Die  bedryf  verskaf  werk
aan tussen 1 000 en  2  000  mense.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Buchu has specific  temperature  and  habitat  requirements,  for  instance
mountainous unfertilised soil which is well drained.  Of  the  approximately
180  endemic  buchu   species   countrywide,   two   are   being   harvested
commercially, but all buchu species  have  been  declared  protected  flora.
This means that nobody may gather,  transport  or  export  buchu  without  a
special permit or licence.

Buchu is one of the Western Cape's most important  floral  export  products,
with an estimated annual turnover of at least  R40  million.  This  industry
provides employment to between 1 000 and 2 000 people.]

This might not seem a lot, but the hon the Minister must bear in  mind  that
10 years ago buchu was selling for 75 cents a kilogram.  Last  year  it  was
sold at R25 a kilogram, and this year, with  the  sliding  rand,  the  price
shot up to R45 a kilogram. The demand  for  buchu  is  increasing  steadily,
with a very healthy export market to Europe, the United  States,  China  and
India.

Buchu has a myriad of uses, therefore it is in such  demand.  In  fact,  all
parts of the  plant  can  be  used.  If  is  used  for  medicinal  purposes,
flavourants, deodorants and soaps, and buchu water is also used as a  tonic.
They also put it in the feed of horses to treat kidney problems. The oil  of
this plant, depending on the quality, sells for between R5 000 and R9 000  a
litre. One hundred and fifty tons of buchu gives  about  1,5  tons  of  oil.
Approximately 800 ml of buchu oil weighs about one kilogram.

To extract the oil, the buchu is cooked before being processed and  a  resin
is extracted from the solids left  behind.  The  water  evaporates  and  the
resin remains. This is powdered and used in top medicine.

The problem with buchu is  that  it  is  like  perlemoen,  abalone,  at  the
moment. The poaching has started.

Die stropers raak al  hoe  meer  georganiseerd.  Hulle  loop  soms  tot  agt
kilometer in reservate in om te pluk. Die boegoe word dan verniel, want  dit
word  uitgetrek;  dit  word  nie  afgesny  nie.  Die  stropery   dwing   nou
grondeienaars in die  gebied  om  boegoe  te  pluk  op  'n  manier  wat  nie
volhoubaar is nie.

Boegoe neem omtrent vyf jaar om te groei. Vanaf  die  derde  of  die  vierde
jaar kan dit geoes begin word. Maar dit moet  net  elke  tweede  jaar  geoes
word, anders benadeel dit saad- en blomvorming. Die grondeienaars  is  egter
nou bang vir moontlike stropers wat kom, en dat hulle met niks sal sit  nie,
so hulle stroop die boegoe elke jaar. Dit beteken dat die natuurlike  aanwas
van boegoe in hierdie gebied, terwyl dit tans 'n hoogtepunt bereik het,  die
gevaar loop om totaal en al uitgewis te word.

Kaapse Natuurbewaring het in samewerking met Elandskloof  se  gemeenskap  en
die produsente verskeie vergaderings gehou. Ek het ook van die  vergaderings
bygewoon. Na die eerste vergadering is daar drie werkgroepe saamgestel.  Die
eerste werkgroep is oor die volhoudbare benutting  van  boegoe.  Op  daardie
spesifieke werkgroep dien daar ook  iemand  van  die  Landbounavorsingsraad.
Die tweede  werkgroep  spits  hulle  toe  op  grensgeskille,  en  die  derde
werkgroep op iets wat baie belangrik is, naamlik menseverhoudings.

Op die oomblik gaan dit baie beter as wat  dit  drie  maande  gelede  gegaan
het. 'n Uitstekende verhouding het tussen  die  gemeenskappe  ontwikkel.  Op
die oomblik, as daar bewerings is  van  iemand  wat  gestroop  het,  of  van
iemand wat  iemand  anders  sleg  behandel  het,  moet  die  betrokkenes  'n
beëdigde verklaring aflê as deel van die ooreenkoms wat  saamgestel  is  vir
hierdie werkgroepe.

Dit is ook 'n goeie  geleentheid  vir  die  boere,  die  gemeenskap  en  die
Landbounavorsingsraad, en dit is hiér waar die Minister se  departement  van
belang is. Ek wil vra vir die nodige geld  sodat  die  Landbounavorsingsraad
kan navorsing doen oor die tegnologie  om  boegoesaad  te  ontkiem.  Dit  is
moeilik. Op Stellenbosch is hulle besig om navorsing daaroor te  doen,  maar
hulle sukkel en het nie veel sukses nie. Dit is  tegnies  gesofistikeerd  om
die saailinge te vestig,  en  daar  sal  ook  besproeiing  moet  wees.  [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The poachers are getting more and more organised. At times they  will  walk
up to eight kilometres into reserves in order to gather buchu. The buchu  is
then destroyed, because they do not cut it, but pull it  out.  The  poachers
are forcing landowners in the area to gather the buchu in  a  way  which  is
not sustainable.

Buchu takes about five years to grow. Harvesting can start  from  the  third
or fourth  year,  but  it  should  only  be  harvested  every  second  year,
otherwise  seed  and  flower  development  can  be  harmed.   However,   the
landowners are now scared that the poachers may come and that they  will  be
left with nothing, so they are harvesting the buchu every year.  This  means
that the natural growth of buchu in this area, although it is  currently  at
a peak, is in danger of being wiped out altogether.

Cape Nature Conservation has held a number of meetings in  conjunction  with
the Elandskloof community and the producers. I have also  attended  some  of
these meetings. After the first meeting three  task  teams  were  assembled.
The first task team is focused on the  sustainable  exploitation  of  buchu.
Someone  from  the  Agricultural  Research  Council  also  serves  on   this
particular  task  team.  The  second  task  team  concentrates  on  boundary
disputes, while the third task team  pays  special  attention  to  something
very important, namely human relations.

Currently things  are  a  lot  better  than  they  were  three  months  ago.
Excellent relations have developed between the communities. At  present,  if
someone has allegedly been poaching, or one person has  mistreated  another,
those involved must make a sworn statement as part  of  the  agreement  that
was drawn up for these task teams.

This is also a good opportunity for  the  farmers,  the  community  and  the
Agricultural Research Council, and this is where the  Minister's  department
is of importance. I want to ask that funds be made  available  so  that  the
Agricultural Research Council can conduct research into  the  technology  of
buchu  seed  germination.  This  is  difficult.  At  Stellenbosch  they  are
researching it, but they are struggling, having  little  success.  Technical
sophistication is involved in establishing these seedlings, and  there  will
have to be irrigation as well. [Time expired.]]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, Deputy Minister, MECs, the MEC of the  Free  State
is ill, and therefore he is unable to be  here.  His  message  is  this:  We
should enable the agricultural sector to move from its  current  reality  to
the strategic objective of, and I quote:


  ...  equitable  access  and  participation  in  a  globally  competitive,
  profitable and sustainable agricultural sector contributing to  a  better
  life for all.

The following national sectoral challenges need to be addressed  with  great
urgency:  Firstly,  an  equitable  access   and   participation   programme;
secondly,   global   competitiveness   and   profitability;   and   thirdly,
sustainable resource management.

To meet these national challenges, the Free State department of  agriculture
has developed a strategic plan which is not only  in  line  with  the  South
African agricultural  sectoral  strategy,  but  also  with  the  Free  State
development plan announced by the Premier  of  the  Free  State  during  the
opening of the Free State legislature in 2002.

The Free State  is  recognised  as  an  agricultural  province.  Agriculture
contributes  on  average  9%  to  the  gross  geographical  product  of  the
province, making it the third biggest contributor  to  the  economy  of  the
province, after mining and tourism.

With regard to our strategic plan and  objectives,  as  gold-  and  diamond-
based economies decline, economic development  in  the  agricultural  sector
must be promoted. The strategic objectives of the Free State  department  of
agriculture are primarily directed at unlocking the  agricultural  potential
of the Free  State  and  focus  on  the  following  co-objectives:  firstly,
agricultural  production  and   processing,   job   creation   and   poverty
alleviation  through   equitable   access   and   participation;   secondly,
agricultural, economic and  market  development;  thirdly,  optimisation  of
plant  and  livestock  health,  production  and  product  safety;  fourthly,
service delivery innovations; fifthly, natural resource and  infrastructural
utilisation  and  management;   sixthly,   improvement   of   research   and
experimental facilities; seventhly, education and  training;  and  eighthly,
good corporate and co-operative governance.

The success of our  strategic  plan  will  be  measured  by  the  successful
achievement of the above-mentioned objectives, aimed at  ensuring  that  our
emerging black farmers have the means to pursue their productive  activities
successfully, while maintaining the established commercial farmers.

The MEC for Agriculture and the MEC for Safety  and  Security,  as  well  as
other  role-players  such  as   organised   agriculture,   have   personally
investigated the livestock theft problem on the  Lesotho  border.  Different
alternatives as solutions  to  the  problem  of  theft  were  received  from
various stakeholders.

It was specifically indicated that with a R1,5  million  fence  and  a  good
relationship between the South African and Lesotho farmers, theft  was  kept
to a minimum for 120 years. It is  thus  proposed  that  good  relationships
between  Lesotho  and  South  Africa  be  re-established  through   liaising
committees, consisting of government and organised agriculture, to curb  the
theft of livestock and infrastructure. The immediate solution to the  border
issue is to increase visible policing and to  restructure  the  stock  theft
unit.

Under state  land  administration,  the  various  functions  of  caretaking,
contractual renting, disposal actions and actions  to  ensure  that  illegal
occupation does not take place are fulfilled. Under the  power  of  attorney
agreement, the Free State is redistributing land  as  quickly  as  possible.
Only 16 000 hectares are still available under the agreement, and this  land
is being redistributed as a high priority, mainly under the LRAD scheme.

This department is working very closely with the Free State provincial  land
reform office on the land redistribution programme.  The  following  figures
apply up until March 2002 for the LRAD  scheme.  One  hundred  and  nineteen
project applications have been approved, there are 630 direct  beneficiaries
of land redistribution, of whom 33% are  women  and  66%  men,  and  28  000
hectares of farm land, to the value of R20,5  million,  have  been  approved
for transfer.

These totals represent 33% of the total number of hectares redistributed  in
the whole of South Africa. After March 2002, that is, over  the  past  three
months, a further 15 project applications have  been  approved,  111  direct
beneficiaries of land redistribution have benefited, and 6 000  hectares  of
farmland have been approved for transfer, to the value of R4,4 million.

At the end of June 2002 the totals were therefore as follows: 134  projects,
741 beneficiaries, 34 000 hectares,  and  R25  million  in  grants.  Various
initiatives have already been launched and  are  in  the  process  of  being
implemented to expedite redistribution.

The know-your-neighbour campaign, where mentorship support  from  commercial
farmers and various role-players is initiated, as  well  as  the  pick-your-
neighbour campaign, in which farmworkers and emerging farmers are  supported
to acquire land with  mentorship.  Inputs  from  organised  agriculture  are
currently being implemented.

Intensive aftercare support, training amd mentorship are  also  provided  to
ensure that businesses are put on  an  economically  sound  and  sustainable
basis. A total of 600 LRAD  beneficiaries  have  already  received  training
during 37 courses, at a cost of R130 000.

The Free State department of agriculture was also able to spend R638 325  on
land care projects during the 2001-02  financial  year.  This  was  a  joint
effort,  involving  project  committees,  the  private  sector   and   local
government. The first regional land care committee was  established  in  the
Thabo Mofutsanyane district, while a number of training sessions  were  held
with emerging farmers, with the emphasis on veld  management.  As  a  direct
result,  some   emerging   farmers   are   adopting   sustainable   resource
conservation farming methods.

The Land Bank is fulfilling its function as  an  important  role-player  for
supplying  finance  to  both  the  commercial  and  emerging  sectors.   The
following figures apply to support for emerging farmers  settled  under  the
Land Redistribution  for  Agricultural  Development  grant:  there  were  71
projects involving 380 beneficiaries, R6,7 million was awarded in loans,  27
000 hectares of land were involved and R17 million was awarded in grants.

During 1998 the European Union donated 17 million euro to South  Africa  for
agricultural development and food security. The  Free  State  Department  of
Agriculture is expected to contribute a third of the total  towards  capital
investment for development projects.

For the first three years great difficulty was experienced  in  implementing
this programme effectively. Up until June 2001, 64 projects to the value  of
R11,4 million had been  approved,  of  which  R3,5  million  was  physically
disbursed to these projects. Currently, 129 projects have been approved,  to
the value of R20,3 million, of which a total of R11,8  million  has  so  far
been disbursed to  all  the  projects.  A  total  of  2  111  beneficiaries,
comprising 907 females and 1 104  males,  are  currently  supported  through
this programme.

In the past, South African agricultural producers  traded  within  a  highly
protected environment. Towards the end of the 1990s, the domestic  marketing
of agricultural products changed completely with  the  introduction  of  the
new Agricultural Marketing Act of 1996 and the abolition  of  the  marketing
boards. Globalisation also opened up unlimited opportunities  for  producers
to optimise their export earnings. More innovative producers  were  able  to
utilise the opportunities  that  came  with  this  increased  market  access
immediately. Others are only now realising that they need to adapt  if  they
want to survive in the open market system.

Previously, prices were determined by Government after taking  into  account
issues such as input costs. This entailed that  as  input  costs  increased,
product prices were adjusted accordingly. In the  free  market  environment,
however, it happens that product  prices  sometimes  increase  before  input
costs do. This is due to  the  market  powers  of  demand  and  supply,  and
farmers have to make use of these opportunities to increase their  earnings.
The terms of trade, ``ruilvoetverhouding'',  in  agriculture,  which  is  an
indication of the extent to which producer prices in agriculture  keep  pace
with the prices of variable costs, strengthened from 0,7 in 2000 to 0,78  in
2001. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! The MEC for Agriculture in Gauteng!

HON MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

Ms M E METCALFE (Gauteng): Chairperson, it is nice to  get  ``hear,  hears''
from the Western Cape as well as from my colleagues behind me. I  just  want
to comment that every time I come to  the  NCOP,  one  of  the  things  that
always impresses me is the contributions made by  hon  member  Versfeld,  in
the sense that they are always drawn from very detailed  constituency  work.
I think that  we  should  acknowledge  that  and  thank  her  for  that,  as
speechless as she may seem by that compliment, because I  do  not  think  it
happens often. [Applause.]

I will have to have a debate with my colleagues, who are telling me she  has
a farm. But whether it  concerns  environmental  issues  or  whatever  other
issues, her contributions are deeply rooted in constituency work and I  want
to recognise that.

Now, I think members may think that I am starting off on a  tack  like  that
because there is general scepticism  in  the  country  that  Gauteng  should
indeed have an MEC for Agriculture. Everyone's  image  of  Gauteng  is  very
much of a highly urbanised environment, but I think I  need  to  remind  the
House  that  in  fact  comparative  national  figures  of   production   and
contributions to gross national product and gross  geographic  product  show
that, indeed, Gauteng compares very  favourably  with  other  provinces.  We
have over 3 000 farmers. We have nearly 40 000 farmworkers in  Gauteng,  and
at least 6 000 black farmers that are currently operating.

One of the challenges, though, is that only  67%  of  our  potential  arable
land is being cultivated at the moment and  we  do,  therefore,  have  spare
capacity. In terms of contribution to the provincial  economy,  agricultural
production accounts for the greatest foreign export earnings after gold  and
mining, so it is  indeed  a  very  significant  contribution  to  our  gross
geographic product and one of the strategic goals of the  department  is  to
increase this contribution.

I think the reasons  for  this  disproportionate  value  of  agriculture  to
Gauteng, despite the fact that we do not have large  farms,  mealie  fields,
rolling fields of sugar  cane  and  the  winelands  of  the  Cape,  are  our
advantages in terms of infrastructure and access to markets, the  fact  that
we have easy access both in terms of domestic and international markets.

In fact,  our  veterinary  services  in  Gauteng  last  year  issued  export
certificates for, I think, over 16 million kilograms of meat. All that  meat
is certainly not produced in Gauteng, but passes through Gauteng on its  way
to  the  international  markets.  We  also  have  advantages  in  terms   of
communication and our commodity supply and transport.

But there are also real challenges facing agriculture in  Gauteng.  I  think
that anyone who has done a bit of work in agriculture will know that if  one
looks at agricultural resources, it  is  really  towards  the  east  of  the
country that one has better provision of water,  better  quality  of  soils,
and that large portions of Gauteng would fit into a picture  where  we  talk
of water stress and semi-arid conditions.

But the challenges are also greater, and that has to do with competing  land
uses. We are continually faced in Gauteng with demands and applications  for
subdivision  of  agricultural  land.   To   some   extent   subdivision   of
agricultural land can be good for  agriculture,  particularly  for  changing
the race and gender profiles and patterns within agriculture in  Gauteng  in
terms of ownership. But more often those subdivisions of  agricultural  land
lead to the establishment of residential areas on what we believe  is  high-
quality agricultural land.

The challenges of this are enormous, because there is high demand  for  land
in Gauteng, both for residential and for  industrial  and  commercialisation
processes, which does inflate the value  of  land  and  which  has  negative
consequences for people interested  in  farming,  because  of  the  negative
impact of that on their gross margins.

The reality is that because of those competing land uses in Gauteng,  we  do
have to look at the comparative analysis of other sectors  of  the  economy,
and we must allow those to determine choice of land use, so  that  the  most
profitable and sustainable land use patterns are supported.

Now, arising from some of this debate, there has  been  a  decision  by  our
provincial executive council, lekgotla, that in this financial year  we  are
going to undertake detailed comparative economic analyses in  terms  of  the
updating of  the  Gauteng  trade  and  industrial  strategy  that  was  last
formulated in 1997. That strategy identified growth sectors for the  Gauteng
economy and was the precursor in terms of the  work  that  resulted  in  the
Blue IQ industrial strategy,  of  which  major  components  are  indeed  the
information technology area, tourism and the automotive industry area.

This work is going to be a very important piece of strategic  thinking  that
is going to guide the way that we approach land use patterns, and  also  the
way that we support the agricultural sector  strategy  the  Deputy  Minister
spoke about.

In the  meantime,  we  are  working  very  hard,  together  with  our  local
governments and IDP processes, to make sure  that  we  do  retain  full  and
sustainable use  of  agricultural  land  for  primary  production.  We  have
completed a very detailed agricultural resource audit that is  going  to  be
translated this year into a web-based decision support tool, which  will  be
an agricultural potential atlas. I know other  provinces  such  as  KwaZulu-
Natal have done similar work.

We have completed an agricultural  audit  of  our  smallholdings,  of  which
there are about 3 000, and  in  terms  of  our  strategic  goal  to  provide
agricultural information systems to support best  decision-making,  we  have
done some very exciting work, not only around niche  markets,  but  we  have
also done some production trials under controlled  conditions  in  terms  of
high-value crops, some of them indigenous crops, such as  bambara  or  brown
onion, spilanthes, green amaranthus and others.

What has been phenomenal and very exciting to the department - some  of  our
farmers who are here and people who have an  interest  in  agriculture  will
know this - is that the forecast profiles of  profit  per  hectare  are  way
above what the textbooks say. For example, in terms of  spilanthes,  we  are
talking about a profit per hectare of R4 500, and in terms of  our  forecast
for green amaranthus, we are looking at R10 000 profit  per  hectare,  which
is very exciting.

I spoke about the fact that  we  do  have  an  audit  for  smallholdings  in
Gauteng and that we are under huge pressure in terms of  land  use.  One  of
the ways that that is felt very keenly in the province is in  terms  of  the
continual increase in  illegal  evictions  in  terms  of  the  Extension  of
Security of Tenure Act. The Gauteng legislature, in the second half of  last
year, passed a resolution  that  they  required  the  MEC  for  agriculture,
conservation, environmental and land  affairs  to  work  in  a  co-ordinated
function with all the relevAnt stakeholders to improve the effectiveness  of
the application and implementation of the Extension of  Security  of  Tenure
Act in Gauteng. We are very delighted with the progress that is  being  made
there.

Our meetings, which happen every two months or so, are attended by  all  the
relevant local authorities and a range of national  government  departments,
including the Department of Labour, the Independent  Complaints  Directorate
and  the  provincial  Ministry  of  safety  and  security.  Of  course,  the
Department of Land Affairs is a very important component of that forum,  and
we  also  have  very  strong  participation  from  the  agricultural  unions
operating  in  Gauteng,   particularly   AgriGauteng   and   the   Transvaal
Agricultural Union, as well as Saapawu,  the  union  which  does  work  with
farmworkers.

The progress that is being achieved there, I think, is enormous in terms  of
being able to co-ordinate information in terms of the  three  goals  of  the
Extension of Security of Tenure Act. One  of  the  major  problems  that  we
experience is the lack  of  resources  to  assist  people  that  are  facing
illegal eviction, and that is a constant plea  to  the  Department  of  Land
Affairs,  to  provide  the  necessary  resources  so  that  people  can   be
supported.

In terms of the positive obligations on the state to make  interventions  in
terms of translating what is intentional permanent security  of  tenure,  as
envisaged in the  Constitution,  we  have  really  made  enormous  progress.
Currently we work with two major organisations  representing  landowners  of
farms and we are going to take forward the framework for an agreement  where
all members of AgriGauteng and the  Transvaal  Agricultural  Union  will  be
guided by their  unions  as  to  how  they  can  start  working  with  local
authorities, and primarily with the Department of Land  Affairs,  to  ensure
that we do have  on-farm  residential  settlements  that  are  provided,  or
perhaps off-farm as envisaged by the Extension of Security  of  Tenure  Act,
so that instead  of  just  trying  to  prevent  illegal  evictions,  we  are
actually taking forward the positive implications of the Act.

The fact that we have the World Summit on Sustainable Development,  I  think
poses particular opportunities for all of us in terms of  both  our  use  of
natural resources  as  well  as  food  security.  This  morning  I  had  the
opportunity of hearing our  Director-General  for  Agriculture  on  the  Tim
Modise show. She did extraordinary well and I believe  Tim  Modise  and  the
public must have been very proud of that leadership.

But because the resource base in agriculture is finite, we believe  that  it
must be the responsibility not only of Government, but also  of  land  users
to ensure that we do have best practice, and  that  that  best  practice  in
terms of sustainable land use must result in  the  reduction  of  persistent
organic pollutants, that there must be greater investment by  landowners  in
land care, that waste disposal,  particularly  in  the  livestock  industry,
must be  better  managed,  as  well  as  that  there  must  be  better  risk
management.

In Gauteng we do a lot of work in terms of land care. One  of  the  legacies
of Fangile Tite, who has now joined the national department,  is  land  care
regional forums, where land users, together with the relevant  national  and
provincial departments, ensure that there  is  dissemination  of  ideas  and
information, and co-ordination around land care issues.

In this financial year we will be working together with  Working  for  Water
to clear about 20 000 hectares of land of alien invasives.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, before I start with the debate  I  want  us
to get clarity on a situation for order in this debate  and  the  House.  We
need a ruling on the announcement that all DP members had to  forfeit  their
membership of the DP before one o'clock this afternoon and to  join  the  DA
by signing such a form.

If any member of the DP in this House has signed the form, it  means  he  or
she cannot be a member of this House today and we need clarity on  this.  If
they are not members, they have to go. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I know  recent  events  have  excited  a
great deal of activity among members and parties. However, as far  as  I  am
aware, the particular law that the hon member is  referring  to  comes  into
effect tomorrow. As far as I am aware, at this time there is no  party  that
has merged in the way described by the member with respect to membership  in
the National Assembly or the provincial legislatures.  To  my  knowledge,  I
have not been  informed  by  either  the  Secretary  of  Parliament  or  the
Secretary of the NCOP of any change of party or membership.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I still think that the  matter  needs  some
investigation because there are such allegations. But  thank  you  for  your
ruling. [Laughter.]

When we talk about agriculture in this debate we need to be  aware  of  some
realities.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member, is that a point of order?

Ms C-S BOTHA:  Chairperson,  I  certainly  hope  so.  I  think  that  it  is
necessary  that  this  House  not  be  misled  about  the  nature   of   the
legislation, which does not allow NCOP members to do anything of  the  kind.
If the member had been informed correctly,  he  would  not  have  made  that
statement. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! That is not a point of order. I  suggest
that all hon members familiarise themselves with the  relevant  legislation.
[Laughter.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, that is exactly why I  asked  whether  they
had joined the DP, because they are not allowed to cross  the  floor  and  I
know that some of them would have loved to. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Proceed, hon member.

Mr A E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  since  1995  the  production  costs  in
agriculture have increased by more or less 43%. Our inflation rate over  the
same period was in the order of  31%,  which  means  that  the  increase  of
production costs was higher than inflation.  The  shocking  aspect  is  that
agriculture product price only increased by 16% over the same period.  I  do
not see the hon the Deputy Minister  here  to  respond  to  this  later  on.
[Interjections.]

Ms C-S BOTHA: He crossed the floor.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hope that he did not cross the floor.  He
has to answer first.

South Africa's farmers, black and white, can compete with the  best  farmers
anywhere in the  world,  but  we  cannot  compete  with  other  governments.
Government's assistance to agriculture in South Africa is approximately  5%;
in the EU it is 45%, in Japan 63%, and in the US 22%.

This  is  not  where  the  unfair  competition  stops.  Illegal  imports  of
agricultural products which compete directly with our  own  amount  to  many
millions of rands. It is estimated that the  Government  lost  approximately
R1,2 million in tariff fees over the past two and half years. The latest  is
that syndicates steal grain from lorries. But we congratulate  the  SAPS  on
the breakthrough they had in this regard yesterday.
Die strategiese plan vir landbou in  Suid-Afrika  is  egter  'n  hoogtepunt.
Landbou is só belangrik dat die President nou self betrokke  is,  maar  daar
is 'n probleem. Hierdie plan het R400 miljoen nodig, en ons sien dit nie  in
die begroting nie. Ek sou graag, as die agb Adjunkminister dit  gehoor  het,
dat hy daarop reageer. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The strategic plan for agriculture in South  Africa  is,  however,  a  high
point. Agriculture is  so  important  that  the  President  has  now  become
involved, but there is a problem. This plan needs R400 million,  and  we  do
not see this in the budget. If the hon Deputy Minister heard this,  I  would
like him to respond to it.]

South Africa's agriculture is as important as the  gold  industry  to  South
Africa,  and  therefore  it  must  be  protected.  We  must  be  united  and
prosperous in agriculture. I agree with the Deputy  Minister  when  he  says
that it starts on the ground. That is why I want to turn to my province.

In die Noord-Kaap is daar goeie planne, veral  in  die  Kuruman-Mathibestad-
gebied, wat deel vorm van die President se ontwikkelingsplan. Daar is  onder
andere 'n bokboerdery vir die uitvoermark. Dit is goed, maar ek  het  gister
met die hoof-uitvoerende beampte van die  Noord-Kaap  Landbou-unie  gepraat,
wat slegs vaagweg van die projek gehoor het. Dit is onaanvaarbaar  dat  daar
nie beter skakeling is tussen  die  presidensiële  boerderyprojekte  en  die
bereidwillige, kommersiële, georganiseerde boerderysektor nie.

Op Victoria-Wes was daar 'n soortgelyke bokprojek wat 'n  totale  mislukking
was.    Die    gemeenskap    se    bokke    is    uiteindelik    deur    die
dierebeskermingsvereniging verwyder. Ons kan nie in die  landbou  van  Suid-
Afrika sulke mensgemaakte mislukkings bekostig nie.

Die tekort aan veeartse moet aangespreek word, en dit moet by  Onderstepoort
gedoen word. Ons studente hoef nie  Spaans  te  leer  om  in  Kuba  te  gaan
studeer nie, en ons  boere  hoef  nie  tolke  te  gebruik  om  die  Kubaanse
veeartse te verstaan nie. Die Noord-Kaap het 'n groot tekort  aan  veeartse,
en die Noord-Kaap ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In the Northern Cape there are good plans,  particularly  in  the  Kuruman-
Mathibestad area, which forms part  of  the  President's  development  plan.
There is, inter alia, goat farming for the export market. This is good,  but
yesterday I spoke to the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Northern  Cape
Agricultural Union, who has only vaguely heard about  this  project.  It  is
unacceptable that there is  not  better  liaison  between  the  presidential
farming projects and the willing, commercial, organised farming sector.

At  Victoria  West  a  similar  goat  project  was  a  total  failure.   The
community's goats were eventually removed by the Society for the  Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. In the agriculture of South Africa we  cannot  afford
such man-made failures.

The shortage of veterinary surgeons should be addressed, and this should  be
done at Onderstepoort. Our students do not have to learn Spanish to  go  and
study in Cuba and our farmers do not have to use interpreters to  understand
the Cuban veterinary surgeons. The Northern Cape  has  a  huge  shortage  of
veterinary surgeons, and the Northern Cape ...]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, on a point of order ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! What is the point of order?

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, the speaker is supposed to speak on behalf  of
the New NP. There is  somebody  who  will  be  speaking  on  behalf  of  the
province.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That has been noted.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I think that the  hon  Chief  Whip  of  the
province is more confused that I am. [Laughter.] Because I am talking  about
agriculture and referring to the province where I  come  from,  but  I  will
inform her a bit later. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  member,  I  did  not  ask  for  a
debate on it. I ask you to carry on.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I am just reacting and I am allowed  to.  I
hope that you are going to give me extra time this time. [Interjections.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Stay away from the province.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, there is another hand.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Is that a point of order?

Ms  B  N  DLULANE:  Yes,  Chairperson.  There  is  no  interpreting  service
whatsoever. Can somebody interpret for  us?  Those  who  do  not  understand
Afrikaans would also love to hear what the member is saying.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  member,  unfortunately,  for  the
sake of consistency ... We have had this problem an hour ago. So,  you  will
get a translation that you can read. Hon Mr Van Niekerk, please carry on.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, dit  is  baie  belangrik  dat  daar  streng
kontrole moet  wees  oor  vleisslagtings  en  -verwerkings,  veral  vir  die
binnelandse mark, maar ook vir die buitelandse mark. In  die  Noord-Kaap  is
daar op die oomblik 'n groot projek aan die gang om juis  hierdie  deel  van
die bedryf te fasiliteer en  aan  die  gang  te  kry.  Daarom  is  dit  baie
belangrik.

Vyf jaar gelede het agb Minister Asmal, toe hy nog  Minister  van  Waterwese
en Bosbou was, en baie goeie werk gedoen het, 4  000  hektaar  waterweg  vir
besproeiing in die Noord-Kaap belowe. Dit  is  vir  grond  waar  hoofsaaklik
nuwe boere uit die voorheen benadeelde gemeenskap 'n geleentheid gebied  sou
word vir boerdery. Ons weet nie wat daarvan geword  het  nie.  Niemand  neem
die inisiatief om die proses aan die gang te sit nie. Ek hoop  die  Minister
het vir ons duidelikheid daaroor.

Ons sit met  'n  wesenlike  grondbewaringsprobleem  in  die  Noord-Kaap.  By
Hartswater is groot dele bedreig deur versuiping.  Die  Adjunkminister  weet
as die grond versuip, is die produksie en die werkgeleenthede daarmee  heen.
Dit is 'n krisissituasie wat  aangespreek  moet  word.  Krisissituasies  ten
opsigte van grondbewaring is in die Wes-Kaap  en  in  die  Oos-Kaap  in  die
verlede aangespreek, en ons provinsie behoort dieselfde behandeling te kry.

Ons het wel pragtige skemas op papier, maar daar is nie geld om dit  uit  te
voer nie. Nasionaal behoort daar geld geoormerk te word, want  ons  het  net
een bodem en dit vorm die basis vir volhoubare ontwikkeling.

Ek soebat elke jaar vir meer geld vir landbounavorsing, en ek sal nie  ophou
nie totdat daar meer geld toegeken word. Die sukses  van  landbou  in  Suid-
Afrika is in 'n groot mate te danke aan die navorsing wat op  internasionale
standaard was, en aan 'n goeie voorligtingsdiens. Die begroting voldoen  nie
aan die vereistes in hierdie verband nie. Ons  het  nou  'n  nuwe  generasie
landbouers  wat  suksesvol  móét  wees,  en  ons  mag  hulle   nie   hierdie
kompeterende voordeel ontsê nie.

Ons het nou talle boere wat plase op 'n groepbasis  besit  en  daarop  boer.
Sedert Augustus 2001 is daar in die Noord-Kaap  660 000  hektaar  beskikbaar
gestel,  maar  daar  is  nog  baie  min  van  hierdie  grond  wat   enigsins
aanduidings toon dat dit kommersieel sal wees. Ons sal moet aandag  gee  aan
individuele eiendomsreg, en dus individuele verantwoordelikheid.

Ek wil die Minister en die departement, en die  Adjunkminister  ook,  bedank
vir hulle benadering tot volhoubare landbou en  grondontwikkeling  in  Suid-
Afrika, maar  al  die  boere  in  Suid-Afrika  moet  weet:  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, it is very important that there should  be
strict controls  in  place  with  regards  to  meat  slaughtering  and  meat
processing, especially for the domestic market, but  also  for  the  foreign
market. In the Northern Cape at the moment there is a big  project  underway
precisely to facilitate this part of the business and to  get  it  underway.
For this reason it is very important.

Five years ago hon Minister Asmal, when  he  was  still  Minister  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry and doing very good work,  promised  a  4  000  hectare
canal for irrigation in the Northern Cape. This is for land where  primarily
new farmers from the previously disadvantaged communities  would  have  been
given an opportunity for farming. We do not know what  became  of  that.  No
one is taking the initiative  to  get  the  process  underway.  I  hope  the
Minister has clarity on that for us.

We have a substantial soil conservation problem in  the  Northern  Cape.  At
Hartswater big parts are threatened by flooding. The Deputy  Minister  knows
that when the land floods, the production and job opportunities are  drowned
along with it. This is a crisis situation which should be addressed.  Crisis
situations with regard to land conservation in the Western Cape and  in  the
Eastern Cape were addressed in the past and our province should receive  the
same treatment.

We do have beautiful schemes on paper, but there is no  money  to  implement
it. Nationally money should be earmarked for this because we only  have  one
surface and this forms the basis for sustainable development.

Every year I beg for more money for agricultural research  and  I  will  not
stop until more money is allocated. The  success  of  agriculture  in  South
Africa is to a great extent due to research which was  at  an  international
standard, as well as a good extension service. The budget  does  not  comply
with the requirements in this regard.  We  now  have  a  new  generation  of
farmers who will have to be successful and we  should  not  deny  them  this
competitive benefit.

We now have many farmers who own farms on a group  basis  and  who  farm  on
those farms. Since August 2001, 660 000 hectares were made available in  the
Northern Cape, but there is still very little of this land which  shows  any
indication that it will be commercial. We will have  to  give  attention  to
individual property rights and thus individual responsibility.

I want to thank the Minister and the department and the Deputy  Minister  as
well, for their approach to sustainable agriculture and land development  in
South Africa, but all the farmers in South Africa should know:]

... walala wasala. [... you snooze, you lose.]

Ms K C MASHEGO-DLAMINI (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, we  would  like  to  voice
our appreciation to the Minister for her sterling work  in  her  efforts  to
provide the necessary assistance and guidance at an opportune time.

History in  agriculture  is  yet  to  present  co-operative  and  empowering
working relations that will outshine the relationship that we have  come  to
experience so far under the democratic leadership of Minister Didiza.

We have gone through thick and thin during the previous financial year,  and
experienced the various challenges of drought, veld fires,  floods  and  the
scourge of animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, to  which  the
Minister has alluded in her speech.

Through the co-operative working relationship  between  farmers,  Government
and the private sector we have managed to triumph and chart the  way  ahead.
Had it not been for the co-operative effort of all of  us,  the  efforts  of
our skilled officials, the co-operative farmers and the brave leadership  of
the Ministry, we would not have managed  to  deal  with  the  foot-and-mouth
disease in both Nkomazi and Middelburg in Mpumalanga.

We in Mpumalanga would like to express thanks for  the  co-operative  spirit
that prevailed among all role-players during these trying times.  Mpumalanga
has reason to laugh and to celebrate.

We have taken the precaution of ensuring that the animal  health  monitoring
programme is  implemented  in  the  province.  All  our  redline  spots  are
regularly surveyed and monitored.

The area of Mlondozi was unproductive, dry land in past  years,  but  today,
through the soil care programme that the Minister has alluded to, they  have
indeed multiplied fourfold their maize production. This has played  a  major
role in the restructuring of the land use for productive purposes,  and  the
support of the ARC extension officers and the financial  assistance  by  the
NDA are highly appreciated by the Mlondozi farmers.

The agricultural sector  strategy  is  one  of  the  best  initiatives  this
country has ever had and is being applauded as an integrated  strategy  that
is addressing current global challenges. The products of the  sweat  of  all
participants in the  agricultural  sector  will  indeed  take  us  one  step
further in respect of the agenda for agricultural development.

In my province organised  farmers  and  the  department  are  engaged  in  a
process of seeking better ways to implement the strategy. At the  moment  we
have embarked on a  programme  of  engaging  various  stakeholders  with  an
interest in agricultural development, including our  municipalities  in  the
province, to solicit buy-in.  Our  challenge  is  to  align  our  provincial
programme with the national ones in order to ensure synergy.  The  alignment
will  also  ensure  national  accountability  for  resources  allocated  for
agricultural purposes.

We agree with the Minister that the issue of security on farms  is  still  a
challenge, but we are confident that through  the  co-operative  efforts  of
farmers, farmworkers, Government and the community we will  find  a  lasting
solution, as we did with other challenges in the past.

The food security programme is the big programme for our rural community  in
fighting poverty. As a province, we have 42% of  the  high-potential  arable
land and there is  approximately  37%  unemployment,  with  high  levels  of
poverty. We are geared up  to  meeting  the  commitment  of  decreasing  the
number of hungry people by half by the year 2015.  At  this  point  in  time
about 631 poverty relief  vegetable  gardens  are  supported  by  us,  which
involve 95% of rural women.

As Mpumalanga province we support the restructuring of  the  Land  Bank.  We
want to thank them today for the production of the vernacular  brochures  in
our province. We would further  like  to  commend  Onderstepoort  Biological
Products Ltd for producing  a  special  animal  vaccine.  I  would  like  to
encourage them to produce drugs for exotic diseases for the country.

Indeed, it is our quest to push back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.  However,
this cannot be done successfully  unless  the  ownership  of  the  means  of
livelihood, of which land forms the  core,  is  evenly  distributed  amongst
those who wish to be the tillers of the soil.

The exact meaning of the success the Minister has alluded  to  could  easily
be conceptualised if members of this  Council  could  have  the  benefit  of
interacting with the 2 500 beneficiaries already  settled  in  my  province.
Members should imagine themselves in their shoes. The  joyful  and  jubilant
atmosphere that fills the Wakkerstroom, Ermelo and  Piet  Retief  landscapes
that the beneficiaries are experiencing will raise the spirit  of  hope  for
members, as it did for all the claims settled and the 10 471 claims  yet  to
be settled.

The implementation and the introduction  of  the  LRAD  programme  is  being
rolled out really fast in our province. Were it not for  this  project,  the
smile of Baba Khombisa of  Phiva,  the  tireless  fighter  for  agricultural
development, and his colleagues in the seven projects of  Nkomazi,  covering
seven villages, would not be visible as they  walk  across  the  132-hectare
stretch of land inspecting their sugar cane crops.
In the past, as we drove through South Africa, down from the Limpopo  border
gate of Mozambique towards the Mananga border gate of  Swaziland,  the  only
farmer one would see would be white and  probably  Afrikaans-speaking.  But,
today, when taking the same route, one is greeted by the dust cloud that  is
decorating the air as more land is cleared to give way for the  planting  of
more and more crops under the stewardship of a variety of people.

The farming business in this area of Nkomazi has indeed been  redefined  and
reorientated by this Government as  the  business  of  all  people  of  this
country.  The  people  of  Nkomazi  will  always  say:  ``Sibonga  uLaMswane
umntfwanentfombi''.  [We  thank  the  Minister,  LaMswane,  our   daughter's
child.] It is for this reason  that  we  celebrate  with  the  Minister  the
progress she and her department  have  made  in  increasing  the  productive
capacity of this country  through  availing  and  maximising  the  usage  of
agriculture-rich land.

It must also be applauded that the broadening of opportunity in  land  usage
has coincided in such a way that  it  has  assisted  transformation  of  the
ownership  patterns  of  land  in  this  country.  Indeed,  there  are  many
challenges ahead  relating  to  the  post-settlement  of  the  new  aspiring
farmers.

Our province is set to tackle those challenges, and we are  working  closely
with the Land Affairs officials, the land commissioners and  the  Land  Bank
in the province. Let me not hesitate to say that organised farmers from  all
walks of life have pooled capacity to help in this regard.

As a  province  we  support  the  signing  of  the  trilateral  co-operation
agreement. For us it serves as a safety net for the new landowners in  order
for them to start to use their land productively.

On behalf of the people of Mpumalanga I support the work  of  the  Ministry.
We call upon this House to support the Ministry in being included in  social
services and to be part of this department  so  that  the  poverty  of  this
country can be alleviated. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, it a great pleasure  for  me  to  speak  in  the
House with my hon colleague the MEC, who is here for the first time in  this
capacity. He is already doing very good work in the Western Cape  with  some
of the initiatives that he has taken, and I welcome  him  here  today  as  a
colleague.

I have to say to the Minister that I think things are looking  up  for  her.
If I look at the 2000-01 production year  and  at  what  is  happening  now,
things are looking much better. The Minister must take some  of  the  credit
for that.

There has been a sharp increase in grain  prices;  maize  prices  have  more
than doubled; and wool prices, I think, are something like 80%  up  on  last
year. Meat prices and grazing conditions are generally good in the  country.
We have had a record table grape harvest in the Lower Orange  River  region.
I think they had a record harvest of approximately  14,5  million  boxes  of
grapes that we exported - 6,5 million more than last year - at good prices.
Here in the Western Cape, of course, we had our problems, as we did also  in
my area with downy mildew which reduced the  grape  harvest.  As  a  result,
there was a shortage of white wine  and  grape  juice.  However,  the  apple
industry is looking promising for the first time in a long time. Prices  and
volumes are good, and so things are looking better than they were.

This brings me to my speech. To some extent things are still  travelling  on
the momentum of the past. In terms of the problems  in  our  country,  there
are three basic challenges, I think.  They  are:  confidence,  security  and
research. Without confidence one will have no investment, and one  will  not
have commitment. Without  commitment,  one  will  have  no  investment,  and
without investment, one  will  have  long-term  problems  in  the  industry,
because this is an industry which is hugely capital intensive  and  one  has
to keep investing.

I would just like to give the Minister  an  example  of  that.  I  think  my
figures are probably right. Something like 11,5% of the farms are  for  sale
in this country or are on the market, as opposed to a historical average  of
about 3,5%. Also, the prices in real terms are far down on  what  they  were
just a few years ago. That is a very bad thing because  if  the  prices  are
not good, if the collateral  the  farmer  has  is  not  very  good,  if  his
confidence or his feel-good factor is not good, then one is  going  to  have
all kinds of problems downstream.

Of course part of that does not fall under the Minister's department  as  it
is a question of rural safety. I say to the Minister that  if  there  is  no
rural safety, if there is no farm security; there is going  to  be  no  food
security in Southern Africa, because farm  security  and  food  security  go
hand in hand.

The Minister would know, 900 farms were attacked last year,  which  is  much
more than in Zimbabwe. One hundred and forty  farmers  were  killed  in  our
country. That is an  absolutely  hopeless  situation  and  cannot  continue.
Nothing has demonstrated the need for food security better  in  our  country
than  the  current  prevailing  famine  circumstances  in  Southern  Africa.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Mr Durr, there is a point of order.

Mr K D S DURR: No, I am not prepared to take a question.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Mr Durr, there is a point of order.

Mr K D S DURR: The hon member wants to ask a question. I  said  that  I  was
not prepared to take a question. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: But sit down at least, Mr Durr.

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  Durr,  the  Chair  is  in   control.
[Interjections.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Thank you very much, Chairperson. My point of order  was  that
the hon member must be disciplined to abide by  the  Rules  of  this  House.
When the Chair asks him to sit down, he should do so in terms of a point  of
order.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I have attended  to  that,  hon  member.  Hon
member, what would be the point of order now, because nobody is speaking?

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Hon Chairperson, I want to say, without  prolonging  this
matter, that the member should with immediate effect apologise to the  Chair
of the House.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member  Durr,  will  you  continue
with your speech. [Interjections.]

Mr K D S DURR: I know that the Minister is very interested in farm  security
and we thank him for his efforts in that regard.

Now the last thing is the question of research ...

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, on a point of order:  The  hon  member  proposed
that the hon Durr apologise for undermining the Chair. I am  standing  here,
Chairperson, to say that he actually  is  disregarding  the  Rules  of  this
House. Therefore the  hon  member  must  apologise  to  the  Chair  for  not
listening to the Chair when the Chair says something to him.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  I  called  the  member  to  order  by
drawing his attention to the fact that I was in the Chair. Hon member  Durr,
will you please apologise for not obeying the Rules of the House,  and  then
continue.

Mr K D S DURR: You have my apology, Chair.

On the question of research, we are the second  largest  fruit  exporter  in
the world. We exported the first refrigerated fruit to Europe more than  100
years ago in 1902, I think,  to  Covent  Garden.  We  exported  our  Alberta
peaches to them. This was 50 years before  the  Australians.  Now  they  are
beginning to overtake us, and that worries me.

One of the reasons for that is the level of research that we  are  applying.
Therefore, I was absolutely delighted to hear  from  the  Minister's  speech
that it is intended that public-sector investment in  agricultural  research
is increasing from 1% to 3% of agricultural GDP.  I  can  think  of  nothing
more important than that.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: We  are  fighting  for
that.

Mr K D S DURR: Oh, you are fighting for it, hon Minister. Yes, I  understand
that. I understand that the plan of the  NARF  is  being  supported  at  the
moment. I say to the Minister that it is absolutely vital. For  example,  if
one looks at the problems in the apple industry, a lot of it is  related  to
cultivars. Unless we stay ahead of the game in terms  of  our  research,  we
are going to lose.

So those are the three points I wanted  to  make,  namely  the  question  of
security, the question of confidence and the question of adequate  research.
With that we wish the Minister well  for  a  successful  agricultural  year.
[Applause.]

Mr J P GELDERBLOM (Western Cape): Madam Chair, hon Minister  and  colleagues
of other provinces, it is a privilege to be here this afternoon.

Ek wil heel aan die begin sê dat ek  dank  wil  uitspreek  teenoor  Minister
Thoko Didiza en Minister Dirk du Toit vir die  wyse  waarop  hulle  Wes-Kaap
altyd ontvang en vir die kennis wat hulle met ons deel. Van ons  landboukant
af, bring ons hulde aan persone wat bereid is om te  luister  na  ons  saak.
Baie dankie vir die wyse waarop ek met die  adjunkminister  in  gesprek  kan
tree en die probleme van die Wes-Kaapse landbou  bespreek.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I would right at the outset like to express my gratitude to Minister  Thoko
Didiza and Minister Dirk du  Toit  for  the  manner  in  which  they  always
receive the Western Cape and for the knowledge  that  they  share  with  us.
From our agricultural side, we pay tribute to persons who  are  prepared  to
listen to our cause. Thank you very much  for  the  manner  in  which  I  am
allowed to enter into discussions with the Deputy Minister and  discuss  the
agricultural problems of the Western Cape.]

In the Book of Proverbs we find the words: ``Where there is no  vision,  the
people perish''. I have a vision for the people of  the  Western  Cape,  and
this vision is of enough food, where the farmers,  be  they  commercial,  or
resource poor, and their workers have healthy and  prosperous  lives,  where
our precious resources are  handled  with  respect,  and  where  agriculture
takes its rightful place on the demanding and ever-changing world markets.

Ek glo vandag dat ons in die finansiële jaar  wat  voorlê  in  die  Wes-Kaap
aansienlik meer geld benodig om in  landbou  te  belê.  Ons  is  ten  nouste
verbind tot die doelwitte soos uiteengesit  in  die  nasionale  Regering  se
nuwe landboustrategie. Die Wes-Kaapse regering is oortuig  dat  met  hierdie
plan ons landbou in die regte baan plaas vir die jare  wat  voorlê.  In  die
komende maande sal ons intensief  aandag  gee  aan  die  implementering  van
hierdie plan. Ons is dankbaar dat landbou so 'n plan het en  Afrika  op  die
wêreldkaart kan plaas.

Dit is duidelik dat die tak landbou aansienlik meer  verantwoordelikheid  in
die Wes-Kaap sal moet neem om  as  belangrike  rolspeler  binne  Suid-Afrika
hieraan reg te laat geskied.

Landbou is toegewy aan die ontwikkeling van die landelike  gebiede  van  die
provinsie en sy mense deur te fokus op werk- en welvaartskepping,  sowel  as
op voedselsekuriteit en -veiligheid. Ek voel geïnspireerd  deur  die  magdom
geleenthede wat binne landbou lê, geleenthede om werklik 'n verskil te  maak
in die lewens van die inwoners van die Wes-Kaap. Ek wil so vêr  gaan  as  om
te sê dat landbou die ruggraat is van landelike  ontwikkeling.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follow.)

[Today I believe that during the coming financial year we need  considerably
more money to invest in  agriculture  in  the  Western  Cape.  We  are  very
closely committed to the objectives as stated in the  national  Government's
new agricultural strategy. The Western Cape  government  is  convinced  that
with this plan we are putting agriculture on the right course for the  years
that  lie  ahead.  In  the  coming  months  we  will  focus  our   attention
intensively on the  implementation  of  this  plan.  We  are  grateful  that
agriculture has such a plan and can place South Africa on the world map.

It is clear that the agricultural branch should  take  considerably  greater
responsibility in the Western Cape in order to ensure, as an important role-
player in South Africa, that this comes into its own.

Agriculture is dedicated to the  development  of  the  rural  areas  of  the
province and its people by focusing on creating work and wealth, as well  as
on food security and safety. I feel inspired by the wealth of  opportunities
in the agricultural sector, opportunities to make a real difference  in  the
lives of the residents of the Western Cape. I shall go  as  far  as  to  say
that agriculture is the backbone of rural development.]

Agriculture is the backbone of rural development.

Landbou voorsien in die mees basiese  behoefte,  naamlik  die  behoefte  aan
kos. As 'n mens egter kyk na Maslov  se  bekende  hierargie  van  behoeftes,
voorsien landbou ook in die hoogste vlak  van  menslike  behoeftes,  naamlik
selfverwesenliking, deurdat ons mense help om hul drome waar  te  maak.  Ons
staan daardie mens wat met sy wese begeer om 'n boer te wees by, en vat  hom
aan die hand.

Ons prioriteit vanjaar is om landelike ontwikkeling te bevorder,  en  daarom
is dit belangrik dat ons hierdie ruggraat van ons ekonomie in  die  Wes-Kaap
vertroetel sodat hy sy rol kan speel in die groter  ekonomie  van  die  Wes-
Kaap.  Ons  wil  gelyke  toegang   tot   deelname   in   die   landbousektor
bewerkstellig, en volhoubare landelike ontwikkeling stimuleer. Ons  wil  ook
alle produsente se mededingendheid op plaaslike, sowel as  op  nasionale  en
internasionale, gebied verhoog om sodoende die kosbare  hulpbronne  tot  die
Wes-Kaap se beskikking volhoubaar te benut, en dit vir toekomstige  geslagte
te bewaar. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Agriculture provides in the most basic need,  namely  the  need  for  food.
However,  if  one  looks  at  Maslov's  well-known   hierarchy   of   needs,
agriculture also provides for human needs at the highest level, namely self-
realisation, in that we help people  to  realise  their  dreams.  We  assist
those people who desire with their entire being  to  be  farmers,  and  take
them by the hand.

Our priority this year is to promote rural development, and for that  reason
it is important that we nurture this backbone of our economy in the  Western
Cape so that it can play its role in the  greater  economy  of  the  Western
Cape.  We  want  to  bring  about  equal  access  to  participation  in  the
agricultural sector, and stimulate sustainable rural  development.  We  also
want to improve the competitiveness of all producers at  local  as  well  as
national  and  international  levels,  in  so  doing  to  bring  about   the
sustainable utilisation of the precious resources available to  the  Western
Cape and preserving them for future generations.]

Without dwelling on the past, we must  admit  that  the  present  situation,
also in agriculture, is a result of  the  past.  To  quote  F  W  Robertson:
``There is a past which is gone forever, but there  is  a  future  which  is
still our own''.

The encouraging thing is that what we do today will  influence  the  future.
Through focused training programmes and the settlement of emerging  farmers,
we can create a healthier and more balanced picture of  agriculture  in  the
Western Cape.

Een van die belangrikste maniere om  gelyke  toegang  tot  deelname  in  die
landbousektor  te  verseker,  is  om  voldoende  aandag  te  skenk  aan  die
voortgesette ontwikkeling van een  van  landbou  se  vernaamste  hulpbronne,
naamlik sy mense. In dié verband glo  ons  dat  plaaswerkers  vorentoe  meer
aandag moet kry wanneer dit kom by opleidingsprogramme,  en  daarom  het  ek
reeds vanjaar in my begroting voorsiening gemaak vir die nodige  opleidings-
en vaardigheidsprogramme vir ons plaasmense. Om te  verseker  dat  opleiding
die korrekte aspekte aanspreek, is ons tans besig met 'n  ondersoek  na  die
behoeftes van veral plaaswerkers, beginnerboere,  en  begunstigdes  van  die
grondhervormingsprogram.

In die Wes-Kaap se begroting het  ons  reeds  'n  addisionele  R6,1  miljoen
toegeken  vir  die  bou  van  bykomende  voortgesette   onderwysfasiliteite.
Ongelukkig is dit so dat daar  geld  beskikbaar  is  vir  ander  instellings
wanneer dit kom by opleiding, maar daar is nog nie  genoeg  geld  beskikbaar
gestel, vanaf nasionale kant, vir die opleiding  van  plaaswerkers  nie.  As
ons daaraan dink dat 70% van Afrika se arm mense in landelike  gebiede  bly,
glo ek dat daar gekyk sal moet word na die toekenning van  addisionele  geld
vir vaardigheidsopleiding ten opsigte van plaaswerkers.

Die gewilligheid van die departement alleen is egter nie  voldoende  om  reg
te laat geskied aan  so  'n  belangrike  aspek  van  die  landbou  nie.  Die
produsent sal ook 'n rol  moet  speel  om  plaaswerkers  aan  te  moedig  om
verdere vaardigheidsopleiding te ondergaan.

Ek wil ook vandag my dank betuig aan Agri Wes-Kaap vir  die  groot  rol  wat
hulle speel in die versoeningsproses tussen werkgewers  en  werknemers.  Die
daarstelling  van  'n  gedragskode  tussen  werkgewer  en  werknemer  is  'n
uitstekende voorbeeld van hoe vêr ons alreeds gevorder het in ons poging  om
goeie verhoudinge te stabiliseer  en  te  bevorder.  Ek  wil  Agri  Wes-Kaap
gelukwens met die doeltreffende wyse waarop hy sy werkgewers  en  werknemers
nader aan mekaar bring. Hervestiging van nuwe boere  gaan  ook  gepaard  met
probleme. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[One of the most important ways of ensuring equal  access  to  participation
in the  agricultural  sector  is  by  paying  sufficient  attention  to  the
continued  development  of  one  of  the   most   important   resources   of
agriculture, namely its people. In this regard we are of  the  opinion  that
in future more attention should be paid to farmworkers as  regards  training
programmes, and for that reason I have already made provision in  my  budget
for the necessary training and skills  programmes  for  the  people  on  our
farms. In order  to  ensure  that  the  correct  aspects  are  addressed  by
training we are presently conducting an  investigation  into  the  needs  of
especially farmworkers, emerging  farmers  and  beneficiaries  of  the  land
reform programme.

In the Western Cape budget we have  already  allocated  an  additional  R6,1
million for the building of additional  continuing  educational  facilities.
Unfortunately it is a fact that money is  available  to  other  institutions
when it comes to training, but  not  enough  money  has  as  yet  been  made
available, from the national side, for the training of farmworkers.  Bearing
in mind that 70% of Africa's poor live in rural areas,  I  do  believe  that
the allocation of  additional  money  for  skills  training  in  respect  of
farmworkers will have to be investigated.

However, the willingness of the department alone is not enough  for  justice
to be done to such an important aspect of  agriculture.  The  producer  will
also have to play a role  in  encouraging  farmworkers  to  receive  further
skills training.

I want to convey a word of thanks today to Agri Western Cape for  the  major
role  they  play  in  the  reconciliation  process  between  employers   and
employees. The introduction of  a  code  of  conduct  between  employer  and
employee is an excellent example of how much progress we have  made  in  our
attempt to stabilise and promote good  relations.  I  want  to  congratulate
Agri Western Cape on  the  efficient  way  in  which  it  has  succeeded  in
fostering  better   relations   between   employers   and   employees.   The
resettlement of emerging farmers is also fraught with problems.]

Land is a fundamental  issue,  in  essence,  to  most  South  Africans.  The
process of land redistribution for agricultural development is one in  which
we believe and to which we give  great  priority.  The  creation  of  a  new
directorate responsible purely for farmer settlement  is  an  indication  of
the high regard we have in our province for the merits of this programme.

I am proud to announce that, to date, more than R24 million has  been  spent
on the redistribution of land and settling of new farmers on 3 500  hectares
throughout the province. During the next year, we plan to  spend  more  than
R7 million on the settlement of new farmers and infrastructure development.

Probleme met oordrag van transporte na nuwe eienaars  word  tans  ondervind.
Ek dink dit is 'n praktiese probleem en ons sal moet kyk  hoe  ons  dit  kan
bespoedig. Ons het baie goeie samewerking met ander  departemente.  Ons  sal
egter die proses moet stroomlyn, want om  18  of  24  maande  te  wag,  maak
sommige van ons werknemers gefrustreerd. Ons sal moet  ondersoek  instel  na
die  proses  van  die  oordrag  van  plase.  As  ons  daardie  probleem  kan
aanspreek, kan ons miskien vinniger die plase op die persone se name kry.

Dit is ook vir ons belangrik om, ten opsigte van plaastoekennings,  vir  ons
mense die nodige nasorgdiens te gee. In dié verband het ons in die  Wes-Kaap
besluit om vir  nuwe  inwoners  en  nuwe  boere  op  die  plase  die  nodige
voorligting te gee. Die tyd is verby dat ons net vir iemand kan sê: Daar  is
'n plaas. Dit is ook ons verantwoordelikheid,  vanaf  landbou  se  kant,  om
baie nouer betrokke te raak in dié verband. Daarom sal ons in  die  Wes-Kaap
hierdie rol in al groter mate speel. Ons wil die  Minister  bedank  dat  ons
weet dat ons ook vanaf nasionale vlak die nodige steun van die Minister  sal
kry.

Dit is so dat die Wes-Kaap baie sterk steun op landbou. Dit is een  van  die
twee ekonomiese slagare van ons provinsie. Dit is ook so dat die landbou  se
uitvoerprodukte vir ons van kardinale belang is ten opsigte  van  ekonomiese
groei.

Die mededingende posisie van 'n sektor word  deur  'n  hele  aantal  faktore
bepaal. In die verlede was die aard  van  die  natuurlike  produksiefaktore,
beskikbaarheid van goedkoop arbeid en kapitaal die basis van  internasionale
mededinging. Hierdie tradisionele konsepte van  grond,  kapitaal  en  arbeid
word egter toenemend vervang deur kennis en inligting as bron van welvaart.

Ons het vanjaar meer as R1,5 miljoen by die Departement van Landbou  begroot
ten opsigte navorsing, bykomend tot die R14,3 miljoen wat ons reeds  verlede
jaar daarvoor begroot het. Die Afrika-renaissance kan en sal werk, maar  dan
sal ons in 'n toenemende mate moet seker maak  dat  navorsing  sy  regmatige
deel van die groter begrotingskoek kry. In dié verband is ek  baie  dankbaar
om  te  sê  dat  ons  in  die  Wes-Kaap  daardie  rol  speel,  en  dat   ons
ondersteunend sal wees.

Ek wil die Minister ook bedank vir die gesindheid en  die  hartklop  wat  sy
openbaar  teenoor  navorsing.  Ons  besef  dat  navorsing  die  toekoms   se
programme vir ons gaan aandui, nuwe projekte vir ons van stapel gaan  stuur,
en ook sal  meehelp  dat  as  ons  met  navorsing  sal  voorloop  sodat  ons
voldoende nuwe werkgeleenthede kan skep. Navorsing bly vir die Wes-Kaap  van
kardinale belang, omdat ons landboubedryf in die Wes-Kaap  grootliks  afhang
van navorsingsuksesse. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Problems  regarding  the  transfer  of  deeds  to  new  owners  are   being
experienced at present. I think this is a  practical  problem  and  we  will
have to see how we could expedite it. We have  excellent  co-operation  with
other departments. However, we will have to streamline the process,  because
some of our employees are frustrated by having to wait 18 to 24  months.  We
shall have to investigate the process by which farms are transferred. If  we
could address that problem, it might  take  less  time  to  have  the  farms
registered in the names of the relevant persons.

It is also important to us, in  respect  of  the  allocation  of  farms,  to
provide our people with the necessary follow-up service. In this  regard  we
in the Western Cape have decided  to  provide  new  residents  and  emerging
farmers on the farms with the necessary extension service. The time is  over
merely to say to someone: There is a farm. It is  also  our  responsibility,
as agriculture, to become far more involved in this regard. For that  reason
we in the Western Cape will play this role to an increasing extent. We  want
to thank the Minister for knowing that we will also  receive  the  necessary
support from him at the national level.

It is a fact that the Western Cape relies very strongly on agriculture to  a
great extent. It is one of the two economic arteries of our province. It  is
also true that agricultural exports are of  cardinal  importance  to  us  in
respect of economic growth.

The competitive position of a sector is determined by a number  of  factors.
In the past the nature of the natural production factors,  the  availability
of  cheap  labour  and   capital   formed   the   basis   of   international
competitiveness. However, these traditional concepts of  land,  capital  and
labour  are  being  replaced  to  an  increasing  extent  by  knowledge  and
information as a source of prosperity.

This  year  we  budgeted  more  that  R1,5  million  at  the  Department  of
Agriculture in respect of research, in addition to the R14,3  million  which
was budgeted for this last  year.  The  African  renaissance  can  and  will
succeed, but then we will have  to  ensure  to  an  increasing  extent  that
research receives its just portion of the greater budgetary  cake.  In  this
regard I am pleased to say that we in the Western Cape play  that  role  and
will be supportive.

I would also like to thank the Minister for her attitude towards  and  heart
for research. We realise that research will identify future  programmes  for
us, launch new projects for us, and also contribute to our taking a  leading
role in respect of research,  enabling  us  to  create  sufficient  new  job
opportunities. Research remains of vital importance  to  the  Western  Cape,
because our agricultural industry in the Western  Cape  depends  largely  on
research successes.]

Another factor that exercises a strong influence on the  competitiveness  of
our producers is the issue of food safety. There is no doubt that the  state
is the accepted custodian to render guarantees to consumers on  food  safety
issues. Failure to do  so  is  met  with  great  and  understandably  severe
retaliation from the  public.  I  need  not  remind  hon  members  that  the
outbreak of mad cow disease in  the  United  Kingdom  resulted  in  complete
chaos. The contamination of poultry  resulted  in  the  resignation  of  the
Minister of Agriculture in  Belgium  and  the  Minister  of  Health  in  the
Netherlands.

The majority of producers in the agricultural sector  in  the  Western  Cape
are export orientated, which can be  expected  if  one  considers  that  the
province contributes 60% to all agricultural exports of the country, to  the
amount of R7 billion per annum.

The province is currently poorly positioned  to  meet  the  demands  of  our
international trade partners. The recent inspections of the  European  Union
have identified several faults in the national certification and  veterinary
service delivery system to guarantee our animal products  safe  for  export,
especially in respect of the ostrich and dairy industries.  We  need  to  be
proactive by providing the means and infrastructure  to  our  officials  ...
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson, hon Minister,  Deputy  Minister,  hon  members,
ladies and gentlemen,  when  closing  his  debate  yesterday,  the  hon  the
President referred to a train of progress that we  as  South  Africans  must
join. This train is never going backwards, but is always moving forward.  It
is a train that  advances  towards  transformation,  creating  a  new  South
African and an African identity; a train of a multitude of opportunities;  a
train never to be missed.

Land reform is central to that journey. It is the  engine  that  drives  the
train of progress forward, for  without  addressing  the  injustice  of  the
past, the injustice of forced removals, that train cannot move  forward,  as
we have witnessed  in  our  beloved  neighbouring  country,  Zimbabwe.  Land
reform is of critical  significance  to  that  journey,  as  it  drives  the
transformation process to redress the historical  injustice  that  left  our
people landless and poor. It is about pride, belonging, development,  growth
and empowerment.

The key objectives of land reform, which are to ensure security  of  tenure,
eliminate overcrowding,  supply  residential  and  productive  land  to  the
poorest  of  our  society,  underpin  economic   growth,   foster   national
reconciliation  and  stability,  improve  household  welfare  and  alleviate
poverty, are critical to the  prosperity,  progress  and  stability  of  our
economy.

On that note, I would like to congratulate the department  for  its  efforts
to ensure that the objectives of land reform are met. I would  further  like
to congratulate the department for the route it has chosen  to  reverse  the
legacy of land dispossession through orderly processes of land  restitution,
land redistribution and land tenure reform, and  respect  for  the  rule  of
law. This has contributed and will continue to contribute  significantly  to
poverty alleviation, equity, efficiency and sustainable growth.

We are all aware that it has indeed been a challenging  and  difficult  task
for the department, but that did not  discourage  the  department.  Instead,
this made it more determined to succeed in contributing  to  a  better  life
for all.

The land restitution programme, for instance,  has  increased  significantly
since April 1999 due to the adoption  of  simpler  administrative  processes
for the resolution of cases. In terms of redistribution, opportunities  have
been created to improve the economic  livelihoods  of  people  through  land
allocation, while on the other hand dealing with tenure security issues  has
given the landless the right to own  land.  These  developments  do  not  go
unnoticed and are important to our democracy.

I am  going  to  repeat  what  other  speakers  have  just  said.  Today  in
Mpumalanga province 2 500 out of 12 971 labour  tenants'  claims  have  been
settled. In KwaZulu-Natal 2 654 out 6 000 labour tenants' claims  have  been
settled.

I would further like to congratulate the department on  the  launch  of  the
land redistribution for agricultural development subprogramme  of  the  land
redistribution programme, which  is  central  to  economic  development  and
poverty alleviation.

In support of the Urban Renewal Programme, 20  154  hectares  of  land  were
delivered to vulnerable  communities  and  individuals.  Yimpumelelo  enkulu
ngokumangalisayo ke leyo. [That shows a very big success.]

With regard to land restitution, the commission has  settled  29 877  claims
as at the end of March 2002, with 332 243 beneficiaries representing 62  245
households.

Ayisisithelanga loo nto.  Iyandivuyisa  intetho  yoMphathiswa  xa  esixelela
ukuba  yena   neSebe   lakhe   baye   baphulaphula   xa   abantu   bebesithi
mabakhawulezise,    kuba    uziso    lweenkonzo    luyacotha     kwimimandla
yasemaphandleni. Kambe ke uyatsho  uMphathiswa  ukuba  sakuba  sitsho  njalo
kunyaka  ophelileyo  baye  benza  imitsi  ukuze  babe  ngoku  banale  ngxelo
ibhaliweyo apha.

EMpuma Koloni baye babuyisela  umhlaba  kwimimandla  esemaphandleni  kusapho
lwakwaGwitshi, kwikomiti yobuyiselo-mhlaba iDwesa, neefama zolimo  ezingama-
20 eMakhoba. Kambe ke, le nto ndiyihlakulela  ngokuthi  sithi  siyazi  ukuba
balisebe  elikhathalayo.  Bathi   bakungxoliswa   basukume.   Loo   nto   ke
ndiyithethiswa kukuba andifuni ukuba batyhafiswe yile nto ndiza  kuyithetha.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[That is not unknown to us. The hon Minister's speech makes  me  happy  when
she tells us that she and her department listened when people asked them  to
speed up the process, because the delivery process is slow in  rural  areas.
However, the hon Minister also mentions that when we  said  the  same  thing
last year, they took appropriate steps to speed  up  the  process  and  that
enabled them to present this report that is before us.

In the rural areas of the Eastern  Cape,  land  was  given  to  the  Gwitshi
family, the land distribution committee, Dwesa and 20 farms  for  production
of crops at Makhoba. I say this because we know that they are  a  department
that cares. Complaints always urge them into action. That I  say  because  I
do not want them to be discouraged by what I am just about to say.]
However, with transformation comes challenges.  I  am  concerned  about  the
slow process of delivery with regard to land  reform,  particularly  in  the
rural areas.

Kuthiwa izicelo zobuyiselo-mhlaba eziphicothiweyo zingama-9 022,  Rodwa  ke,
xa sithetha ngezintathu kuphela ezithe zalunga phaya emaphandleni,  loo  nto
ithetha ukuba le nkqubo isacotha. Sibathembile kodwa  ukuba  baya  kuthi  xa
bephinda bebuya bathi bavile ukuba abantu bathi le  nkqubo  isacotha.  Asazi
ke  ukuba  olu   lwazi   silufumana   kubo   njengeengcaphephe   lunyaniseke
kangakanani na, kodwa ke ndiza kuluphalaza. (Translation of Xhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[It is said that there are 9 022 land claims that  have  been  investigated,
but if we can only speak about just three that  have  been  settled  in  the
rural areas, that shows that delivery is slow. We trust that when they  come
again they will be able to say that they have heard what people  are  saying
about the slow delivery process. We are not sure how valid this  information
we get from them as specialists is, but I have to refer to it.]

Despite the recent speeding up of the restitution  process,  the  number  of
outstanding claims is reported to be massive. Further, it has been  reported
that the bulk of claims settled are urban in nature, claims which  represent
individuals, while rural claims involve  a  far  larger  number  of  people.
Therefore, restitution may have had a limited  role  so  far  in  addressing
rural poverty.

Xa ndiza kuhlala phantsi [Before I sit down] I would  like  to  conclude  by
quoting the hon the Minister:


  The struggle for dignity, equality and a sense of belonging has been  the
  driving force to honour the promise of the Constitution  to  restore  the
  land rights of the people of South Africa.

On that note we are proud of the department's  work  and  will  continue  to
support it for a better life for all. [Applause.]
Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister,  MECs,  comrades,  ladies
and gentlemen, today is World Refugee Day. I think it will be proper for  us
to say that we do have some refugees in our country, and  that  we  want  to
wish them well, and will pray for them.

It is with  great  pride  that  I  have  undertaken  the  responsibility  of
addressing this House on behalf of the Northern Cape  province.  As  members
would know, the province largely depends on agriculture for the  achievement
of sustainable rural development and for improving the lot  of  its  people.
The Northern Cape as an agricultural province has the potential to  increase
South Africa's GDP.

It is in this spirit that we are calling on the Minister to continue  giving
this  province  special  focus.  We  are  glad  that  the  Deputy   Minister
highlighted in his speech the need for an improved GDP contribution.

As we are all aware,  the  year  2002  is  an  important  milestone  in  the
recognition of South Africa as part of the global  society  by  our  hosting
the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August/September  this  year.
It is in this context that an inextricable link is identified in the  issues
raised by the Minister in his Budget Vote and those raised by  the  province
in yesterday's agricultural Budget Vote in our province.

What we should all agree to is that we are faced by  common  problems  as  a
country and as a continent. South Africa faces the  responsibility  of  food
shortages, and this is  an  issue  that  affects  all  of  us.  The  looming
problems facing South Africa and Southern Africa have resulted  in  a  joint
agreement  amongst  the  African  heads  of  state  and  the  South  African
Government to make agriculture a top priority for sustainable development.

The vehicle to drive sustainable growth is the New Partnership for  Africa's
Development, which will focus on six major  constraints  hindering  progress
in agriculture. These are: firstly, assisting rural  populations  to  access
the necessary resources  to  ensure  investment  in  agriculture;  secondly,
providing adequate and efficient agricultural systems;  thirdly,  increasing
the  purchasing  power  of  rural  people;  fourthly,  addressing   climatic
uncertainties by providing more efficient systems; fifthly, ensuring  strong
institutional support through research and extension services;  and  lastly,
ensuring the plight of the rural poor is included on the agendas  of  donors
and multilateral institutions.

In terms of the national agricultural economy, gross  farm  income  for  all
products grew at a rate of 13,3% over the corresponding  period  last  year.
Specifically, gross farm income from field crops increased by 18,3%,  income
from horticultural products increased by 14%, and that from animal  products
by 9,4%. In relation to this, the Northern Cape  agricultural  economy  grew
at similar levels.

In the case of wheat, 56 000 hectares were planted, representing 13% of  the
total national crop. This generated a farm income  exceeding  R500  million.
In respect of maize, 47 000 hectares were planted, representing 5,3% of  the
national production and generating in excess of R580 million.

Some 14 million crates of table grapes were packed, mainly for export.  This
was more than 30% more than the expected production.  In  line  with  higher
than expected grape production, raisins also showed a significant  increase,
with South African Dried Fruit alone paying out more than  R200  million  to
some 1 200 producers.

The situation in the red meat industry also showed a  revival  in  the  past
financial year and present  prices  will  enable  producers  to  consolidate
their position. This potential increase in production for emerging red  meat
producers is enormous and  will  play  a  significant  part  in  opening  up
international meat markets.

The department of agriculture in  the  Northern  Cape  committed  itself  to
performing a number of activities. These include unlocking the potential  of
the provincial agricultural economy, ensuring  food  security,  establishing
an environmentally sustainable framework, and  ensuring  effective  delivery
and administration. Not only have we achieved much of the above,  but  these
pillars are now part of the mission of the department.

The provincial department  of  agriculture,  land  reform,  environment  and
conservation will enable the development of the province by  establishing  a
sustainable  environment  framework  that  seeks  to  unlock  potential  and
provide food security through  the  provision  of  efficient  and  effective
service support. During the past financial year our department  has  managed
to achieve some of these key projects and deliveries from an exhaustive  and
impressive list.

We are able to complete the  three-year  strategic  plan,  which  gives  the
department strategic direction in  terms  of  its  service  provision.  This
allows us also to set the  scene  for  integration  within  the  department.
Financial and staff restructuring was also  undertaken,  which  we  hope  to
complete in this financial year.
In the province's agricultural budget vote  for  2001-02  it  was  mentioned
that the department had set aside R500 000 for the  hydroponics  project  at
Windsorton to create jobs for our people. This project is in the process  of
implementation. A detailed business plan has been developed and  we  are  in
the process of appointing a service provider to erect  the  structures.  The
site has been fenced, and water and  electricity  have  been  supplied.  The
Minister was present at the sod-turning ceremony.

In terms of the land reform  for  agricultural  development  programme,  the
department, in partnership with  the  provincial  office  of  land  affairs,
through  the  Provincial  Grant  Committee,  approved  quite  a  number   of
projects. Examples are the projects in Witpan, Kraanvogel,  Rietfontein,  De
Aar - it is a long list. As part of the advancement of emerging  farmers  by
means of the improvement of their  livestock,  breeding  material  was  made
available  to  various  communities,  including  farmers  at   Niekerkshoop,
Eksteensfontein, Mier, Colesberg and Frazerburg.

During the 2002-03 financial year the department of agriculture will have  a
very strong bias towards and focus on the  sustainable  development  of  the
Northern Cape. This focus will include the following key performance  areas:
changing and unlocking the provincial economy; the  development  and  growth
of  emerging  farmers;  land  reform  and  sustainable   use;   an   overall
sustainable environment; developing the  human  resource  potential  of  the
province; and transferring technology  and  information  through  scientific
research for community development and land uses.

During  the  2002-03  financial   year   the   land   reform   co-ordination
subcommittee will be revived in order to provide a structure  through  which
all land-related development projects can be channelled to enable proper co-
ordination and effective implementation.

During this financial  year  our  department  will  make  available  28  708
hectares of state agricultural land to  emerging  commercial  farmers.  This
will be in the form of leasing, outright sale and access  to  grazing  land.
The programme for the disposal has already started  with  the  advertisement
of seven units for lease and sale in the Kgalagadi district,  two  units  in
Siyanda, and one in Frances Baard for sale to emerging commercial farmers.

Ten projects will be undertaken which  will  involve  the  establishment  of
approximately 50 new commercial farmers. In conjunction with the  Department
of Land Affairs, 25 projects will be implemented,  which  will  involve  125
beneficiaries. Information sessions for communities on  land  redistribution
for agricultural development will continue to take place.

As part of our  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme,  the
cross-border municipalities in the Kgalagadi district, identified as one  of
the presidential nodes, the department spent R100 000 in  Kono  on  windmill
maintenance, the purchase of boer goat rams  and  Bonsmara  bulls,  and  the
repair of fences. The department also offered an  informal  training  course
on vegetable production in Bankhara/Bodulong to the amount of R6 000.

This year the department has set aside R350 000 to start a  waste  recycling
project, and R110 000 has already  been  allocated  to  start  a  land  care
project.

The department will in  this  financial  year  strengthen  the  efforts  and
expedite the process  of  providing  post-settlement  support  in  terms  of
agricultural  development  to  land  reform  beneficiaries.  Some  work  has
already been done, for example a training course was organised  for  farmers
in Kono in March 2002, and the department also purchased tools for  farmers,
as well as repaired fences.

To  increase  the  levels  of  permanent  employment  and   empowerment   of
disadvantaged  communities  through  an  increase  in  primary  agricultural
production and agro-processing activities, the department is going to  fast-
track the process of allocating 4 000 hectares  of  water  rights.  To  this
effect, we are in the process of appointing the  project  co-ordinator.  The
post has already been advertised. The following has, however, been  achieved
so far: establishment of the reference group and draft  terms  of  reference
for the project co-ordinator finalised.

For the 2002-03 financial year  our  department  will  be  implementing  the
strategic plan for South African agriculture.  The  agricultural  sector  in
the province will be engaged to develop a  common  implementation  approach.
In view of this, the technical staff of our department is to meet  with  the
general manager of the Northern  Cape  agricultural  union  to  discuss  the
implementation plan. So we want to assure the Deputy Minister that the  good
work done by the presidential working group will bear the necessary fruit.

Our people are caught  in  a  trap  of  poverty  and  hunger  that  requires
particular attention. Reducing hunger is not  only  humanitarian,  but  also
has a strong economic rationale. To address the plight of  our  people,  the
department, together with other departments  during  the  Letsema  volunteer
programme, provided families and projects with starter packs  that  included
wheelbarrows, seeds, seedlings, irrigation  equipment,  implements  such  as
garden forks, and so forth.

To make sure that this  is  not  a  once-off  exercise,  the  department  is
launching a household food security unit to promote self-reliance  regarding
sustainable food security. The unit will focus on  women,  children,  youth,
people with disabilities and the unemployed in order to  produce  their  own
food as they are the most vulnerable.  The  department  has  made  available
R460 000  this  financial  year  to  start  eight  household  food  security
projects - two per region in our province.

One of the provincial strategies is to target vulnerable groups  for  social
and economic renewal. In the light of this and  of  strengthening  women  in
the agriculture, our department is  currently  organising  a  conference  on
women in agriculture. This conference will highlight specific  issues  faced
by  women  in   the   agricultural   sector   and   should   give   specific
recommendations relating to  the  establishment  of  strategies  to  address
issues surrounding women's participation in  the  agricultural  sector.  The
conference also aims significantly to improve their  livelihoods  to  enable
them to have the same opportunities and access to resources  as  their  male
counterparts. This conference will be held in  the  Karoo  district,  in  my
home town, De Aar, from 31 July to 2 August.  We  are  expecting  about  130
women farmers to participate in this conference.

The amount allocated to these programmes is in no  way  recognition  of  the
opposition's  accusations,  but  rather  has  to  do  with  the  fundamental
restructuring  and  rethinking  around  the  roles   of   conservation   and
environment. As mentioned previously, the Platfontein and the  Schmidtsdrift
projects are to take conservation out of the  electrified  fences  and  into
the real lives of people. [Applause.]

Mr N SINGH (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, Deputy Minister,  hon  members,  it
is a pleasure to follow on a former senator colleague  -  Senator  Sulliman.
Firstly, I would like to associate my department and me with the  ideas  and
objectives expressed by the  Deputy  Minister  on  behalf  of  the  national
Minister, particularly in the crucially important areas  of  food  security,
poverty alleviation and farmer settlement and support.

KwaZulu-Natal and the national departments appear to be of one mind on  such
issues, and I find this a pleasing indication of the smooth meshing  of  the
activities  of  our  two  spheres  of  government,  as   required   by   the
Constitution.  I  also  believe  that  the  grain  famine,  which  currently
threatens so much of Southern Africa, starkly underlines  how  important  it
is that every region of agricultural potential, in every country, should  be
geared towards optimising production.

The hon member Mr Sulliman did remind us that today is  World  Refugee  Day.
It was quite interesting to note that when some of  the  people  were  being
interviewed this morning, a reason they gave for  seeking  asylum  in  other
countries was the famine that existed in their very own countries.  On  that
theme, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the  hon  Minister  in
absentia for including me in the South African delegation to the World  Food
Summit in Rome. It was indeed a very  worthwhile  exercise  for  me  as  one
responsible for agriculture in KwaZulu-Natal,  and  I  certainly  came  back
with many ideas which I think I can share with the rest of my colleagues.

This World Food Summit essentially was a follow-up to the World Food  Summit
of 1996, where there was a declaration that malnutrition should  be  reduced
in the world. Unfortunately, many aspects of the 1996 declaration  were  not
adopted, because in 1996 it was agreed that by the year  2015  there  should
be a reduction of at least half of the 800 million people  who  suffer  from
malnutrition around the world. Of the 80-odd  national  leaders  that  spoke
from various countries, including our own  President  Mbeki,  it  was  quite
evident that very little was done  to  reduce  the  number  of  malnourished
people in the world. Hopefully, the declaration signed last week  will  lead
towards implementation of what is contained in that declaration.
Again, it was also a privilege for me, on behalf of hon Minister Didiza,  to
co-chair a session  with  the  hon  Minister  of  Agriculture  from  Sweden,
Margareta Winberg. The topic of that session  was:  ``Rural  women:  Crucial
partners in the fight against hunger and poverty.'' I must say  that  having
listened to about 28 representatives from  all  over  the  world,  there  is
certainly clearly a common thread that permeates all of us, whether we  come
from east, west, north or south in this quest to ensure  that  women  around
the world are empowered, particularly in the agricultural sector.

I also had an opportunity there to share with about 400 or 500  people  what
opportunities are available for women in South Africa, particularly  in  the
agricultural sector. I referred to things like institutional reform, to  the
number of women  Ministers  and  Deputy  Ministers  that  are  in  different
parliaments and in our national Parliament, to the initiatives  being  taken
to ensure that women are empowered when it comes  to  land  reform  and  the
acquisition of state land, and to the female farmer of the  year,  which  is
an initiative that only South Africa can boast at this moment in time.

With that, I would like to inform this House about some of the  things  that
are happening in agriculture in KwaZulu-Natal. For  more  than  three  years
now my department has been running a food security programme, which we  call
``Xoshindlala''  which,  translated,  means:  Chase  away  hunger.  We  have
facilitated and funded more than 800 small community food  and  cash  income
production projects, in which there are roughly 30 000 participants and  240
000 beneficiaries. Xoshindlala is to continue, though the main  emphasis  of
activity has switched this year to unlocking agricultural  potential,  which
I see as a major vehicle of poverty alleviation and job creation.

The unlocking programme has three  main  thrusts,  the  first  thrust  being
intensification  of  production.  This  requires   an   intensification   of
extension services and a bringing to bear  of  the  latest  in  science  and
technology. My department is to spend R10 million this year in  establishing
a series of mechanisation service centres, in partnership with  the  private
sector,  to  bring  the  benefits  of  mechanised  farming  to   small-scale
producers especially. In this regard, might I indicate to  this  House  that
we intend paying the deposits for about 200 tractors that  we  will  acquire
in KwaZulu-Natal as a kick-start  to  the  mechanisation  services  project.
This has been done in conjunction with other  role-players,  banks  and  the
Agricultural Development Forum.

Communities themselves would own these structures. They would  have  to  pay
the balance of the purchase price, 90%. We are  also  setting  aside  a  few
million rand in case there are some bad debts so that we as  the  department
will be able to cover them. I might  also  mention  that  land  care  is  an
important  focus  in  KwaZulu-Natal.  Officials   of   my   department   are
concentrating increasingly on the eradication of  weeds  and  alien  invader
plants, which can be useful poverty alleviation projects as well.

The second thrust of unlocking agricultural potential  is  the  facilitation
of agri-industry. Through the KwaZulu-Natal Agricultural Development  Trust,
a public-private sector partnership, my department seeks to facilitate  such
private-sector investment. A R100 million cotton and wheat project is  under
way on the Makhathini flats, and the region is soon to be  marketed  locally
and overseas for private-sector investment.

On the issue of land reform and farmer settlement, I think we are all  aware
that the hon national Minister has given MECs power of  attorney  to  settle
new farmers on state land. So far, in KwaZulu-Natal, we have settled  people
on 36 000 hectares of state  land  with  short-term  leases,  which  can  be
converted to freehold once claims to the land have been adjudicated  on.  In
this regard, I must say that we  are  working  well  with  the  land  claims
commissioner in ensuring that priority  attention  is  given  to  addressing
land  claims  in  areas  which  we  have  identified  as  key   areas   with
agricultural potential.

My department's programme  of  unlocking  agricultural  potential  seeks  to
almost quadruple  production  in  the  province  over  20  years,  a  target
scientifically  established  as  realistic.  To  achieve   this,   we   have
established a tripod-type approach. The tripod consists  of  my  department,
the Development Trust, which I have  already  mentioned,  and  the  KwaZulu-
Natal Agricultural Development Forum, chaired by Dr  Patrick  Sokhela.  This
forum brings together all farming  communities,  small  as  well  as  large-
scale. We therefore, have this tripod consisting of Government, the  private
sector and the farming communities themselves.

I believe agriculture will be a key component of  the  Nepad  configuration,
which our President seeks with the developed world, and I  believe  that  we
in KwaZulu-Natal already have such a configuration in  microcosm  -  a  mini
Nepad. I believe partnership is the answer.

We have borrowed from India the term ``Green Revolution''  to  describe  the
20-year quadrupling in productivity which we have set for ourselves. I  must
emphasise that this quadrupling is no figure snatched from thin air.  It  is
based on scientific data, provided  by  the  department's  bioresource  unit
located at the Cedara Research Station, which combines painstaking  research
over many decades with the modern wonders of computerisation  and  satellite
imagery.

It is now possible, at the touch of a keyboard, to determine what crops  may
be successfully grown,  on  which  farms  in  Kwazulu-Natal,  and  what  the
economic returns are likely to be. I believe that this is  the  only  system
of its kind in Africa, and it lies at the heart of our  plans  for  a  green
revolution.

The House must please bear with me if I now strike a negative note.  I  must
appeal to the hon national Minister for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  to
fast-track  legislation  and  regulations   surrounding   compensation   for
disasters. Last September farmers in the north west  of  KwaZulu-Natal  were
struck by double disaster - runaway fires which caused a huge loss in  human
life, livestock and property; followed by  snow  and  freezing  cold,  which
wreaked further damage.

Officials of my department  and  of  the  KwaZulu-Natal  agricultural  Union
expeditiously gathered details of individual losses,  and  submitted  relief
claims. To date, I believe, not a cent has been received by the farmers  who
have suffered heavy losses. I appeal to the  hon  Minister  for  urgency  in
this particular case and for  an  overhaul  of  the  procedures  surrounding
disaster compensation. I am, however, fully aware of  the  legislation  that
is on the table to deal with this, and I am also fully aware  that  it  does
not fall within the purview of the Department of Agriculture only  and  that
other departments are involved.

Now to revert to the positive - the good news.  The  foot-and-mouth  disease
emergency is over and this was announced by  the  national  Minister.  South
Africa is again  able  to  export  cloven-hoof  meat  products  following  a
decision by the World Organisation for Animal Health that it  should  revert
to its former status as an FMD-free zone.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member,  if  you  could  wrap  up,
please, sir.
Mr N SINGH (KwaZulu-Natal): This follows presentation by  officials  of  the
national department and I want  to  place  on  record  our  appreciation  as
KwaZulu-Natal and on  behalf  of  the  farmers  their  appreciation  to  the
national department and all the officials for that.

Lastly, I would like to agree with the  hon  Deputy  Minister  that  funding
needs to be addressed very critically. The  President  of  our  country  and
many  leaders  have  always  said  that  agriculture  and  tourism  are  the
catalysts for economic development, particularly in rural areas, but  we  do
not see that coming with sufficient funding.

We as people involved in agriculture need to ensure  that  sufficient  funds
are allocated to agriculture so that it can  play  its  meaningful  role  in
economic development and rural development. [Applause.]

Dr P A MOTSOALEDI (Northern Province): Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister  and
colleagues, in February 1999 the provincial government of Limpopo,  together
with members of civil society, adopted agriculture, mining  and  tourism  as
the cornerstones of the economy of our  province.  These  cornerstones  were
put down in what we called  the  growth  and  development  strategy  of  the
province. Needless to say, it is impossible to implement that without  land.
It is for this reason that on behalf of the people of  Limpopo,  I  wish  to
take this opportunity to thank the Minister and her department  as  well  as
the Land Claims Commission for the sterling work done in  giving  land  back
to our people.

In September 1999 only three claims were settled out of 6 000, but  after  a
visit by Rev Moatshe and his  team  from  the  NCOP  to  our  province,  the
Minister moved  very  swiftly  to  implement  their  recommendations  and  a
commissioner was appointed to our province in Polokwane. The result is  that
as I speak here today no less than 10 communities have received  their  land
since February this year, starting immediately after the  President  ordered
that all land claims be settled in three years' time.  Nearly  every  second
weekend since February we have  been  celebrating  in  Reboyile,  Mabungeni,
Shingange, Kranskop, Makotopong and Manamela as  many  more  people  receive
their land.

The Minister and the Chief Land Claims Commissioner, Advocate Mgoqi,  became
such frequent visitors to our province in giving land  back  to  our  people
that  we  are  about   to   give   them   citizenship   of   our   province.
[Interjections.] As for the advocate, I wish to  take  this  opportunity  to
congratulate him on his sterling job  because  tomorrow  the  University  of
Cape Town will be  awarding  him  an  honorary  doctorate  of  law.  To  the
advocate I say congratulations. [Applause.] We also agreed in  our  province
that we would award him an honorary RDP house so that he does  not  have  to
leave the province when awarding land. [Laughter.]

We know that with the return of land comes very  big  responsibilities.  The
White Paper on land allocation states that four issues must be looked at  on
land reform. We must redress the injustices of  the  past;  we  must  foster
reconciliation and stability; we must  engender  economic  development;  and
alleviate poverty and ensure household food security.

In terms of redressing the injustices of the past,  I  think  we  are  doing
very well. In terms of fostering national reconciliation and  stability,  we
also come out with flying colours. The challenge  now  is  how  to  engender
economic development, and how to  alleviate  poverty  and  ensure  household
food security on the land that has been returned to our people.  This  is  a
very big challenge which everybody must be aware of.  For  this  reason,  we
are very fearful in our province of the prospect of finding people  starving
only a few years after their land has been restored to them. Therefore,  the
Limpopo province, the department, together with the Land Claims  Commission,
has set aside R19 million to plan for the utilisation of the land which  has
been returned to our people. For this reason we have devised what is  called
a starter pack which consists of a tractor, a plough, a harrow,  a  planter,
fertilisers and pesticides. This pack  will  be  given  to  every  community
which has received their  land.  Before  the  end  of  this  month,  we  are
expecting validation of 3 800 claims which have been outsourced by the  Land
Claims Commission.

We are also very  happy  that  the  department  has  instituted  LRAD,  Land
Redistribution for Agricultural Development, and  we  need  to  congratulate
them because it has helped us very much. In the province  we  have  taken  a
stand  to  dispose  of  all  state  land  as  a  matter  of  priority,   but
unfortunately we have discovered that about 85% of the  land  earmarked  for
disposal is subject to land claims. Regardless  of  this  problem,  we  have
already settled no less than 24 farmers on 10 367 hectares of land who  were
given LRAD grants totalling R5 784 million.

We also wish to take this opportunity to thank  the  Roman  Catholic  Church
because they have donated 1 897 hectares of land to 203  families  who  have
been tenants on their land. We call on the other  churches  to  emulate  the
noble deeds of the Roman Catholic Church. We have given these  203  families
a grant of R4 million from LRAD for poultry and cattle enterprises on  their
farms. We are also very proud that out of the 24 farmers who  have  received
their land, the biggest slice has gone to a woman. On average  700  hectares
of land are given but we have given more than 1 000 hectares of land to  her
in order to advance gender equality.

We also are very serious about irrigation schemes. One of my colleagues  has
already mentioned the famine threatening  our  neighbouring  countries,  and
quite a number of people are asking if that famine will not also  visit  our
beloved country. In view of this, we recognise that in  our  province  there
are no fewer than 171 irrigation schemes,  in  which  R4  billion  has  been
invested over  the  past  20  to  25  years  by  the  homeland  governments.
Unfortunately, these irrigation schemes are  dysfunctional  in  one  way  or
another and we have in place a 10-year programme to rehabilitate them.

We believe our irrigation schemes have the capacity to support 40 000 small-
scale farmers starting with one hectare to five hectares of land.  According
to our calculations, they can support 250 000 dependants, but we  need  R161
million for this rehabilitation and that  is  the  amount  of  money  which,
unfortunately, we simply do not have. We would be very happy if, as  in  the
past, the national department could help, because we have  rehabilitated  11
irrigation schemes  with  money  from  the  national  departments  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry and of Public Works for which we are very grateful.  We
will continue accelerating the  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  schemes  and
also continue accelerating giving land under LRAD.

Perhaps many hon members do not understand why land is  an  emotional  issue
in our province. In the past week there  have  been  stories  in  the  media
about race relations and hate speech. I am not about  to  go  into  that  in
this House, but I think it is important to put these things in  perspective.
And for this reason I want to read a document here to show exactly what  has
hit our province in terms of the land issue. A  gentleman  by  the  name  of
Westlake drew up a policy document for  one  of  the  homeland  governments.
This document, I understand, was given to all  the  other  homelands  on  15
October 1970, when 10 000 hectares  of  land  were  confiscated  from  rural
communities to plant sisal for the government. The document reads:


  The object of developing a sisal industry within the Bantu  homelands  is
  to provide a source of paid employment for the many Bantu for whom either
  land cannot be found or whose  inclinations  are  to  be  paid  employees
  rather than independent peasant farmers  who  are  often  working  on  an
  uncertain subsistence level.


  The desire to be an independent farmer or businessperson is  probably  no
  more developed in the Bantu than it is in other races and the  desire  to
  find paid employment without taking risks is developing amongst the Bantu
  as it has  done  in  other  races,  and  this  process  will  undoubtedly
  accelerate in years to come.

Mr Westlake went on to say:


  The constant clamour by Bantu for land is closely tied up with  his  fear
  of old age and land is in many cases looked upon  as  the  only  old  age
  insurance. This fear is real and can only be eliminated  when  the  Bantu
  has got used to normal, steady employment allowing him to set aside funds
  for his old age.


  Steady employment draws a large number of Bantu to  the  white  areas  as
  little  such  employment  is  available  for  him   in   his   homelands.
  Furthermore, in the Bantu homelands such employment would appear unlikely
  to materialise to a large extent for years to come because the  prospects
  of large industries run by Bantu are remote.


  The development of industrial agriculture  crops  may  therefore  play  a
  great role  in  relieving  the  pressure  on  the  land  and  in  finding
  industrial employment for a number of Bantu.


  Some of the industrial crops such as cotton, tea, coffee,  etc,  open  up
  venues for large-scale employment, but for these  crops  the  demand  for
  labour will often be seasonal, and they may grow in areas  which  already
  have a high potential ... A fibre crop  such  as  sisal  would,  however,
  appear to have virtue.

The results of  this  legislative  imposition  is  that,  for  instance,  my
colleague  in  Gauteng  has  only  500  employees  in  the   department   of
agriculture. I also know that my colleague in the Western Cape has  no  less
than 650 employees,  but  in  Limpopo  we  have  13  700  employees  in  the
department of agriculture following this policy. For this  reason,  we  have
developed a five-point strategic plan. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Nkk B THOMSON: Mphathisihlalo, ngizothi qaphuqaphu ngoba ngincishiwe  kuleli
thuba  amaminithi  okukhuluma.   Nginikwe   amaminithi   amancane   sengathi
ngiyiqembu  elincane.  Kodwa-ke  angisho  lutho,  ngizophonsa  nje   kancane
esivivaneni  lapho  sekuphonse  khona  odadewethu  nabafowethu.  Ngizobabiza
ngodadewethu nabafowethu ngoba uma sekuza endlaleni  izisu  ziyefana.  Isisu
sami nje uma sesilambile siyefana nse nesika-Versfeld. Uba nolaka  naye  uma
eselambile,  nami  ngiba  nolaka.  Ngakho-ke  ziyefana  izisu  uma   indlala
isifikile.
Ngizofuna ukusho nje kancane ukuthi kuyaye kube kubi  uma  sishona  le  nale
uma ngabe sesiza ezindabeni eziphathelene nendlala.  Mina  ngokwami  ngibona
ukuthi inselele  yendlala  ilele  ngqo  kulo  mnyango  kaNgqongqoshe  uThoko
Didiza. Yebo,  ngiyazi  ukuthi  neminye  iminyango  njengomNyango  wezeMpilo
nowezeMfundo inaso lesi sigejane soqedindlala kodwa umnyango  obhekene  nale
nselele ngqo umNyango wezoLimo nezemiHlaba.

Ngiyaye ngiphatheke kabi  ngoba  ikhona  le  nsila  yokuthi  abantu  bakithi
abathandi kahle  ukulima  noma  sebethi  bayazama  uyaye  uzwe  sebekutshela
ukuthi, ``asinazo izinto zokuvundisa inhlabathi'' bese  uyabona  nje  ukuthi
kusekude emuva naphambili.  Abanakho  lokhu  kuqonda  kokuthi  zikhona  lezi
zinto zokuvundisa eziyimvelo  njengomquba  nezitibhili  zezinkukhu.  Ngiyazi
ukuthi  oJoyce  noNono  abazi  nokuthi  ngikhuluma  ngani   uma   ngikhuluma
ngobulongwe.  Into  abangakaze  bayibone  leyo  okuyofuna  ngelinye   ilanga
ngiyiphathe ngopulasitiki ngizobakhombisa ukuthi into  enjena-ke  ubulongwe.
[Uhleko.]

ILUNGU: Sihlalo, uyadelela.

Nkk B THOMSON: Sihlalo,  hhayi  angideleli.  Ngiyazi  ukuthi  kuba  yinkinga
ngoba sikhuluma ngezinto  abanye  bethu  kule  Ndlu  abangazazi  lezi  zinto
esikhuluma   ngazo.   Abanye   bayawuthenga   umoba,   thina   KwaZulu-Natal
asiwuthengi, singena nje eceleni kwehlathi siqhephule bese  siyadla.  Ezinye
zezinkinga  esiyaye  sihlangabezane  nazo  lezo  ukuthi  sikhuluma  ngezinto
abantu abangazazi.

Ngiyafuna  ukuxoxa  ukuthi  mina  lapho  ngizalwa   khona   indlala   impela
sasingayazi,  sasifidwa  size  sifidwe  nangomakhelwane.   Nanamhlanje   uma
ngiqhamuka lapho  ngizalwa  ngakhona  bayaye  bacabange  ukuthi  kusaqhamuka
lokhuya  kudla.  Bayaye  bacabange  ukuthi  bazothola  lokhuya  kudla   bese
ngiyabatshela ukuthi sekwabheda phela manje ngoba abafuni ukulima nokufuya.

Kukhona le nto yokuthi iphekwa ngomhluzi  wenye,  abakwazi-ke  oJoyce  lokho
``ukupheka ngomhluzi wenye''. [Uhleko.] Ukuchazela oComrade Joyce,  ukupheka
ngomhluzi wenye ukuthi uhlabe bese upheka  kuthi  kungakapheli  bese  uhlaba
okunye bese ukupheka ngomsobho obupheka ngawo  okokuqala.  Abanye  bamalungu
lawo mathuba azange bebe nawo ngoba ngisho igeja  abanye  bamalungu  abalazi
nokuthi libanjwa  ngalaphi.  Ngingathi  ngiyabanika  baliphendule  balibambe
ngalapho lingabanjwa  ngakhona  ngendlela  okusafuneka  ngayo  ukuthi  thina
njengamalungu  lezi  zinto  sizame  ukuthi   sizibuyisele   kubantu   bethu,
bakhumbule futhi bakwazi  ukuzenza  ngoba  impela  impela  abantu  abalimayo
indlala ihambela kude nabo, akulula ukuthi bayithole.

Mhlawumbe-ke njengoba sengishilo  ukuthi  ngike  ngafunda  ku-Natal  Witness
iphepha  elalibhalwe  nguRaymond  Oberg   okhuluma   ngazo   lezi   zindlela
zokuqokelela ukudla, ngabuka ngahala ngathi ukuba benginawo amandla,  abantu
abanjengabo oRaymond ngabe siyabasebenzisa kulo mnyango  ukuze  bathuthukise
abantu  bakithi  kulezi  zinto  ngoba   uma   singabhekile   kahle   indlala
izosijwayela kabi uma ingakasijwayeli kabi.

USEKELA SIHLALO WAMAKOMITI: Thulani! Bengicela ukuba ilungu  elihloniphekile
liqoqe.
Nkk B THOMPSON: Sihlalo, bengithi akufanele  sijwayeze  indlala  ukuthi  ibe
ngumngani wethu. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I will talk briefly because this time I was  not
given enough time to speak. I was given few minutes, as if  I  belong  to  a
minority party. But I am not disputing anything. I will just add to what  my
brothers and sisters have contributed. I will refer to them as brothers  and
sisters because when it comes to poverty, all stomachs are the same. When  I
am hungry my stomach is the same as Mrs Versfeld's stomach when  she  is  in
the same situation. She is very bad tempered when she is  hungry  and  I  am
also the same. Therefore, all stomachs are the  same  when  they  are  being
assailed by hunger.

I would like to mention that it is bad if we always go here and  there  when
we talk about the  issues  of  poverty.  As  far  as  I  am  concerned,  the
challenges of poverty lie in the department of  Minister  Thoko  Didiza.  Of
course, I know that other departments, like the  Department  of  Health  and
the Department of Education, have these groups of hunger fighters,  but  the
department  that  is  faced  with  this  challenge  is  the  Department   of
Agriculture and Land Affairs.

I always get upset, because there is this habit of our  people  not  wanting
to do farming. Even when they try, one hears people say: ``We  do  not  have
fertilizers'' and this means that there is still a long way to go.  They  do
not understand  that  there  are  natural  fertilizers  like  cattle  manure
compost and chicken droppings. I know that Joyce and Nono do not  know  what
I am talking about when I talk about cattle manure. This is  something  that
they have never seen, which means one day I should bring  it  in  a  plastic
bag so that I can show them what cattle manure looks like. [Laughter.]

AN HON MEMBER: Chairperson, she is being contemptuous!

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I am not being contemptuous. I  know  this  is  a
problem because we are talking about things that other people in this  House
do not know. Some buy sugar cane, but we, in KwaZulu-Natal, do not. We  just
go to a bush close by, we break it off and eat it. Those  are  some  of  the
problems that we are talking about here; the things  that  other  people  do
not know.

I would like to share that where I was born, we never  experienced  poverty.
We were fed at home and even by neighbours. Today when  I  visit  the  place
where I was born they think there comes the food.  They  thought  that  they
would get food and I tell them that things have become  worse  because  they
did not want to plough and farm with animals.

There is this saying, which goes: ``it is  cooked  with  the  juice  of  the
other''. Joyce and others do not know about ``cooking it with the  juice  of
the other.'' [Laughter.] To explain this to Comrade  Joyce  and  others,  to
``cook it with the juice of the other''  is  when  one  has  slaughtered  an
animal and then cooked it. While the meat has not  yet  been  finished,  one
slaughters another one that will then be cooked with the juice of the  first
one. Some of the members did not have those opportunities and others do  not
even know how to handle a hoe, which means they  have  never  ploughed  with
it. If I gave it to them now they would turn it and hold the wrong way,  but
these are the things that we need to take back to our people  so  that  they
can  remember  and  be  able  to  do  these  things  since  people  who  are
substantial farmers are far from being affected by hunger.

As I have said, I read an article in the Natal Witness.  It  is  an  article
written by Raymond Oberg, who talked about ways of collecting food.  I  then
developed a ravenous appetite and I thought that if  I  had  the  power,  we
could have used people like Raymond in this department so  that  they  could
develop our people in these fields because hunger is going to cause  serious
problems for us if it has not yet done so.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Can I ask  the  hon  member  to
conclude, please.

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I was saying that we should  not  make  hunger  a
friend of ours. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I sympathise with  you,  hon  Thomson,
that you were treated like a minority. But I think it is  good  at  last  to
have experienced it.

Ms B E E MOLEWA (North West): Chairperson, I thought because both the  Chief
Whip of this House and the chairperson of the portfolio committee  are  from
the North West province, I would be given more time. [Laughter.]

Chairperson, Deputy Minister, colleagues from  various  executive  councils,
members from provinces and of this House, and all our friends present  here,
I would like to follow in the footsteps of those of my colleagues  who  have
already congratulated  the  Ministry  and  indeed  the  department  for  the
wonderful work that they are doing  to  develop  agricultural  land  in  our
country. We are delighted as a province to  participate  in  this  important
budget  debate  on  agriculture  and  land  affairs.  We  believe  that  the
contributions we will make, both in this debate and  through  implementation
of our programmes in the province, will go a long way  towards  growing  our
country's economy, creating jobs and alleviating poverty.

As the North West, we are convinced that for us  to  be  able  to  grow  our
agricultural sector, we need to act in unison and develop this sector  as  a
national system. On this basis, we welcome, and will continue to do  all  in
our power to support, the recently developed  sector  strategy.  Very  often
when strategies of this nature are developed,  implementation  plans  follow
much later, resulting in some delays in  implementation.  What  is  pleasing
about this agricultural strategy is that it is agreed to and shared  by  all
in our country and, above all, an  implementation  plan  is  in  place.  The
North West has followed  suit  by  developing  a  provincial  implementation
plan, which details how we as a province will  contribute  to  the  national
strategy.

The  agriculture,  conservation  and  environmental  sectors  are  extremely
important to the economy of our province. We  do  mention  conservation  and
the environment, because we recognise the  need  to  use  our  rich  natural
resources  in  a  sustainable  manner.   The   agricultural   sector   alone
contributes about 13% to the total GGP and 19% to  total  formal  employment
in our province.

The rural  communities  of  our  province  depend  largely  on  agricultural
activities and the use  of  the  surrounding  natural  resources  for  their
livelihoods. In the context of rural poverty, the  natural  environment  and
agro-food sector provide food, fibre,  building  material,  fuel  and  clean
water, which represent the most important basic human  needs.  Ensuring  the
success of these sectors in the province is  therefore  not  only  important
for the economic development, but also for the social safety net  and  basic
needs. It stands to reason, therefore, that in the North West these  sectors
have  a  high  potential  to  grow  and   thereby   contribute   even   more
significantly towards creating a better life for all.
I would now like to touch on some of the issues which we will address  as  a
province  as  part  of  our  contribution.  In  this  connection,  we   have
identified the following key issues to be dealt with.  We  have  three  core
and five supporting  strategic  focus  areas  which  are  contained  in  the
national  sector  strategy;  firstly,  to  enhance  equitable   access   and
participation by  those  who  were  previously  marginalised;  secondly,  to
improve  competitiveness  and  profitability;   and   thirdly,   to   ensure
sustainable resource management, supported by  good  governance,  integrated
sustainable rural development;  to  provide  support  to  international  co-
operation, and safety and security.

Let us  look  at  enhancing  equitable  access  and  participation.  We  are
thankful that in her speech to the National Assembly, and  indeed  today  in
the National Council of Provinces, the Minister,  also  represented  by  the
Deputy Minister, has alluded to the need to implement programmes  that  will
ensure access and participation by those previously  disadvantaged.  We  are
therefore compelled to deracialise land and  enterprise  ownership,  and  to
unlock the full entrepreneurial potential in the  agricultural  sector.  The
focus must  be  on  speeding  up  land  reform,  ensuring  start-up  support
packages for the new entrants into  farming  in  its  entirety,  partnership
development and promotion of the sector.

As a province we appreciate  the  initiative  taken  by  the  Ministry,  the
national department and the Land Bank  in  ensuring  that  within  the  land
reform programme we have a subprogramme known as LRAD. In  this  regard,  we
will continue to work closely with the Department of Land  Affairs  and  the
Land bank, which we can now proudly refer to as an  entity  that  transforms
at lightning speed.

We can proudly report that less than eight months after this  programme  was
started,  18   LRAD   projects   have   been   finalised,   benefiting   113
beneficiaries. We have also finalised 80%  of  distribution  cases  and  new
leases on the 16 000 hectares  of  land  that  we  managed  under  power  of
attorney on behalf of the national department. We  work  very  closely  with
the Land Affairs directorate in resolving the many cases that resulted  from
the reallocation of land by the former Bophuthatswana  government.  A  clear
programme of action is in place to address this problem.

The Land Commission, led by  Ntate  Nguqi,  continues  to  deliver  at  high
speed. Some of the best models of restitition are  found  in  our  province,
for example the Bakwena ba Mogopa case, which will be showcased  during  the
WSSD.

However, we would like to raise an issue, one that  has  remained  a  little
behind, for the Minister to consider, and  that  is  the  need  speedily  to
consider the sunrise package. Some of our farmers own land, but  are  unable
to access adequate funds  that  can  help  them  all  at  once  to  buy  the
necessary implements, fertilisers, insecticides and  pesticides,  seeds  and
all the inputs that are  needed.  We  believe  that,  where  their  proposed
farming business plans make business sense and are viable, we might need  to
consider  providing  start-up  packages  within  the  LRAD  programme.   The
provision of a start-up package can  indeed  take  us  a  long  way  towards
equitable access and participation by those who already own some land.

This brings me to the next issue, that of access to  finance.  Many  of  our
farmers still lack access to finance,  for  reasons  ranging  from  previous
debt to legal requirements.  In  this  regard,  we  welcome  the  initiative
contained and detailed in the sector strategy. As a  province  we  are  also
endeavouring to implement some of the mechanisms that we have put in  place,
and we believe that these will finally help us address this problem.

Sustainability and the graduation of emerging farmers to commercial  farmers
can be achieved through partnerships, intensive training and mentoring,  and
support of such farmers. In this regard, we as a province also have  a  role
to play and we are indeed doing so  through  extension  services,  technical
services, research and so on, and also by working with many of our  farmers'
unions that have developed partnership programmes. We  also  appreciate  the
new outfit that  has  been  started  by  the  Land  Bank  which  deals  with
partnership  development.  Joint  implementation  of  such   programmes   is
unfolding well.

Let us look now at improving competitiveness. We are  duty-bound  to  ensure
that the  South  African  farming  community  has  access  to  international
agricultural markets. There is a dire need to enhance profitability  through
sustained global competitiveness in the agricultural sector,  input  supply,
primary production,  agri-processing  and  the  agri-tourism  industry.  The
initiative of continued research to find inexpensive production methods  and
inputs should be encouraged and supported by all of us  as  legislators  and
implementers.

The bigger battle we face, however, at the international level. If  we  fail
fearlessly to wage and one day win this battle, to  which  I  will  refer  a
little later, the gap between rich and poor countries, between the rich  and
the poor, will become even wider.

While  it  is  imperative  that  we  work  hard  to  improve  the  level  of
competitiveness here in our country,  we  must  encourage  and  continue  to
support our Ministers who fight these battles on  the  international  front.
Their battles are to gain access to markets,  particularly  of  agricultural
produce. The battle against the ever-increasing subsidies of  the  developed
countries must be won.

The reality of the matter is that even if we  were  to  consider  increasing
our subsidies here at home, with all our competing social  needs,  we  could
never really succeed. We could never afford the level of subsidies  provided
by the developed countries. Even though we may strive to be competitive,  we
are not likely to compete successfully on a fair basis.

Let us therefore give all our support to the team  of  Ministers,  that  is,
hon Ministers Didiza, Manuel, Erwin  and  many  others.  Let  us  give  them
support like we give to Bafana Bafana,  Banyana-banyana,  Amabhokobhoko  and
Amaglug-glug. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr R Z  NOGUMLA:  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  hon  MECs  from  the
provinces and my hon colleagues, in 1997 the joint Ministry  of  Agriculture
and Land Affairs was created,  thus  locating  the  national  Department  of
Agriculture and the  Department  of  Land  Affairs  in  one  Ministry.  This
development has enhanced the  ability  of  both  departments  to  streamline
their activities with regard to land administration,  and  has  strengthened
the synergy necessary to support land  reform  for  agricultural  and  rural
development.

The Department of Agriculture has identified  seven  priority  areas.  These
are as follows: farmer  settlement,  market  development,  trade  promotion,
natural  resource  management  and  use,   food   security,   infrastructure
development and human resource development. The more general vision  of  the
Department of Agriculture is to strive to lead agricultural development  for
economic growth  in  South  Africa  and  to  play  a  constructive  role  in
agricultural development in Africa. In essence the vision implies  that  the
strategic  goals  are  to  promote  equitable  access   to   resources   for
agricultural development; to enhance global competitiveness in the field  of
agriculture; to ensure sustainable natural  resource  use;  to  promote  new
entrants to the  sector;  to  ensure  consumer  confidence  in  agricultural
products; and to achieve departmental service excellence.

With regard to global competitiveness, members of  this  House  will  recall
that in a recent debate on African unity and the African Parliament  it  was
mentioned that only a sophisticated and unified  continent  could  negotiate
and improve in terms of trade  in  global  fora  such  as  the  World  Trade
Organisation.

A single lobby group from this continent  would  have  more  muscle  and  be
better positioned to improve its bargaining power when negotiating with  the
developed countries. I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  views  of  the  hon
Minister on this subject because they are very important to us.

The members of the Select Committee on Agriculture are aware of the  various
bilateral agreements that were  negotiated.  These  agreements  reflect  new
ways of dealing with Europe in which relationships are  established  through
Ministers of agriculture in order to work together  with  their  development
corporation partners.

South Africa and the European Union reached an agreement  on  the  technical
aspects of the denomination of certain  types  of  wine  and  spirits.  This
agreement formed the basis of a free-trade zone  between  South  Africa  and
the  EU.  International  liaison  was  promoted  through  co-operation  with
multilateral organisations such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation  of
the UN. The signing of a bilateral agreement with the  Federal  Republic  of
Nigeria was of particular significance as it sought, amongst  other  things,
to  promote  the  transfer  of  technology  within  the  context  of  Nepad.
Agreements were signed  with  other  African  countries  such  as  the  Arab
Republic of Egypt and with Rwanda, the latter in the  field  of  agriculture
and livestock.

With regard to farmer settlement, the Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs has been  working  with  farmers  to  develop  a  strategy  for  the
resettlement of farmers that  will  bring  all  stakeholders  on  board.  In
addition, elementary work has been  done  on  the  Land  Redistribution  for
Agricultural Development Programme, which is designed to provide  grants  to
previously disadvantaged South African citizens from the  African,  coloured
and  Indian  communities  in  order  to   access   land   specifically   for
agricultural purposes. At least 30% of the country's agricultural land  will
be redistributed to black farmers over the next 10 to  15  years.  This  has
already been referred to.

Farmer support  and  development  also  require  that  financial  assistance
become an integral part of this package.  The  members  of  this  House  are
aware that the Land Bank does not only understand  its  new  role,  but  has
also met the challenge of transforming its clientele from a  race-based  one
to a more diverse one.

To date, the Land Bank is proud to announce a R16 billion  loan  book,  made
up of resource-poor farmers and their commercial colleagues. The  department
has  adopted  a  multipronged  approach   to   emerging   farmers.   Besides
facilitating financial assistance,  the  department  makes  sure  that  this
sector also receives training, thereby increasing the prospect  of  becoming
sustainable.

We appreciate the establishment  of  a  flood  relief  scheme,  designed  to
provide assistance to farmers affected by the floods. The Ministry,  largely
through the Department of Agriculture, has the  challenge  of  ensuring  the
establishment of an environment within which opportunities are  created  for
farmers to become prosperous and competitive, whilst making  sure  that  use
of natural resources is sustainable.

The department was historically designed to cater for  the  interests  of  a
relatively  small  number  of  well-resourced   commercial   farmers   whose
production was aimed at attaining national self-sufficiency.  The  so-called
subsistence  farmers  were  serviced  with  a  non-market  orientation.  The
institutional  changes  brought  about  by  a  new  political   dispensation
encouraged the transition from subsistence farming  to  commercial  farming.
The registration of more than 1 500  co-operatives  is  a  demonstration  of
this move away from subsistence farming. In addition, training  is  provided
in conjunction with a German body co-operative. A pilot programme  has  been
launched  in  the  Northern  Province  in  which  buying  associations  were
inaugurated.

The members of this House would  also  like  to  thank  the  department  for
successfully containing the outbreak of  a  foreign  serotype  of  foot-and-
mouth disease, in consultation with other provinces. In May  this  year  the
international organisations  responsible  for  standard  setting  on  animal
health in the world declared South Africa as a  country  that  was  free  of
foot-and-mouth disease. The outbreak of Karnal Bunt in the Douglas area  was
contained.

Following the outbreaks of  the  disease,  the  reinstatement  of  bilateral
trade could be negotiated with most of the countries within the SADC  region
and with  several  international  trade  partners,  including  the  European
Commission, who accepted the  sanitary  guarantees  for  the  resumption  of
trade provided to South Africa.

I could not hide my excitement and  happiness  about  the  contents  of  the
speeches and inputs from the  provinces,  about  my  experience  in  my  own
province and  about  the  progress  that  has  been  made  so  far  by  this
department. This is also reflected by my bag here. This is my bag  from  the
department. I cannot hide the fact it is quite clear that  within  10  years
we are going to see lots of input. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  my
lasting impression from what I heard this afternoon has perhaps to  do  with
two  things.  Number  one  is  the  impressive  activity  going  on  in  the
provinces, and the motivation  to  work  hard  and  drive  the  agricultural
sector and land affairs in the provinces.

I think the provinces are doing excellently. I think things are  going  well
in agriculture in South Africa given the circumstances. I  think  the  rains
have also  helped.  I  hope  next  year  this  time  that  the  agricultural
Ministries will be going as well as the weather is going.  This  has  to  do
not only with the weather, but also with some very solid work that has  been
going on.

The second impression I have is about the  huge  challenge  agriculture  and
land reform represent in this country, and  all  over  Africa.  Hon  members
know how serious this is. Even if we are doing quite  well  at  the  moment,
the challenge out there is huge. Let me give hon members a  few  figures  so
that they can also think about this.

Senegal is doing very well in South Korea with their soccer. They are  doing
very well. Bafana Bafana has also done well. Twenty-five years ago  the  GNP
of Senegal was equal to that of South Korea. Today the GNP  of  South  Korea
is 20 times bigger than that of Senegal. What happened?

The  African  political  and  scientific  leaders  have  set  a  target  for
themselves to increase agricultural output throughout Africa -  and  we  are
part of this - by 6% a year for the next 20 years. I am now  wondering  what
the plans of KwaZulu-Natal are. Six per cent a year for the next 20 years  -
that is what Africa needs to come out on par.

Now from that 6% the improvements in total factor productivity - that  means
real agricultural growth or yield growth - will  contribute  about  half  of
that to 3% a year. The  other  3%  of  the  6%  must  come  from  increasing
investment.

The point of the matter is that achieving  3%  in  total  factor  growth  in
agricultural productivity is extremely challenging. No region of  the  world
has increased their  factor  of  productivity  by  more  than  2,5%  over  a
sustained period of time.

What does it require to achieve that? Number one,  it  will  take  political
will. And I have heard the political will here today, because  South  Africa
is still two worlds, if we talk agriculture.  We  have  a  highly  developed
agricultural sector which, to my mind, really is the result of many years  -
decades - of support that was given to the  white  farming  community.  This
was from dipping tanks, fencing, drought  relief  to  support  systems  that
have been sustained. One of the reasons for that,  if  one  really  analyses
it, was the strong political influence which farmers had here in  Parliament
in this Chamber specifically.

The reason for that was a specific electoral system which  operated  in  the
old South Africa. It was a constituency system which was  loaded  in  favour
of the rural areas or farming areas. A vote in a  rural  area  just  counted
more than a vote in an urban area. That really was the way it  was  -  am  I
right? That is why the farming community had such a huge influence on  these
green benches here. They could ask for subsidies; for support systems.  This
gave results as there is a huge developed farming sector out  there  and  it
is technologically advanced. But that does not apply to the whole  of  South
Africa. We know that.

The new farmers who land  on  the  farms  do  not  have  that  support.  Our
department is now working on the development of  support  systems.  We  must
all work together on that because it is  really  something  that  needs  co-
ordinated action from everyone working in the agricultural sector.  This  is
because - and I need to be truthful with hon members - looking at this  only
in terms of real economical criteria, if  we,  the  state,  compose  a  land
reform policy, even LRAD, or a restitution approach or  whatever,  the  land
passes into  the  hands  of  the  new  emerging  farmer.  But  that  is  not
agricultural support; that is not economic investment. That will only  start
the economic investment - the 3% economic investment I spoke of - but  there
is still the other 3% to get to 6% growth. This is  because  it  is  just  a
case of getting someone else on the land. We have just bought the  land  for
someone, but that does not constitute economic investment. That  must  still
happen.

So we cannot say that is economic growth. We cannot count it. It is  a  good
thing; it is justice that is being done. It  is  a  political  programme  of
redistributing the land. However,  we  must  then  start  growing.  What  is
required to get that 6% growth in all areas of  South  Africa?  Agricultural
research systems are required  that  deliver  knowledge  and  technology  to
increase output productivity. We have to  do  that  without  destroying  the
environment, without destroying the market systems. Secondly,  technological
delivery systems are needed that quickly bring the  innovations  to  farmers
and agri-businesses, because we must think further  than  farming.  We  must
think of the agricultural chain. We must think farmer to plate  -  from  the
farmer until the food is on the plate. We must plan that whole chain.

Thirdly, mechanisms must be brought in that reduce the cost  of  inputs  and
the risks of new approaches. I have seen this in action. I saw last week.  I
went down to Wits, where the Agricultural Research Council was delivering  a
seminar to dairy farmers. It is unbelievable what knowledge is available.  I
heard about things I did not know about - how genetics has an  influence  on
mosquitoes and how selenium makes a difference to the  production  of  dairy
cows. It is unbelievable the knowledge that we have available.  The  problem
is to get it out there.
I believe  that  agricultural  research  must  be  intimately  connected  to
extension services. The provinces and the national  department  must  be  at
the heart of our co-operation models. There must be  a  straight  line  from
research down to extension services. That is the only way in  which  we  are
going to get the 6% production yield increase everywhere  in  South  Africa.
[Interjections.] We will work on it.

I will come back to  this  consolidated  budgetary  approach  that  we  have
introduced and on which consultation is already taking place. We have to  do
this,  because  this  is  the  future,  if  one  looks  at  the  growth   in
agricultural productivity in the world. In Africa our  productivity  is  12%
lower than it  was  in  1980.  In  every  country  in  the  world  that  has
experienced development, one will find that  agricultural  productivity  has
increased. That is why KwaZulu-Natal is correct in  their  approach.  It  is
actually happening in all the provinces, but KwaZulu-Natal has  an  explicit
agricultural growth programme. But this is happening in all  the  provinces.
Some provinces are doing very well while  others  have  to  overcome  a  few
problems.

What is happening all over the world is that agricultural production has  to
increase. It is the basis of  general  economic  growth.  If  one  looks  at
Africa's share of total world agricultural trade, in 1965  Africa  accounted
for 8% of world trade in agricultural products. What is it now, or at  least
a few years back? The figure I have is for 1996, which is 3%. We are  losing
out and there is no reason for this. Africa has the land and the people  who
can farm. We have everything, but it  is  also  understandable,  because  we
were held back by the  colonial,  apartheid  and  other  systems  that  were
inflicted on Africa. We were held back and we focused on other  areas,  such
as urban development and health. Money had  to  go  for  social  development
projects, and for housing. I also want an  RDP  house  next  to  the  Kruger
ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [Laughter.] But I will  also  accept  a  hut  near  the  Kruger!  The
reasons are complicated.

There has been a lot of talk about agricultural research. There  are  macro-
economic reasons why research funding in South Africa  stagnated,  and  even
decreased. We do acknowledge  that  this  is  a  problem,  and  we  have  to
increase the funding. But let me be very honest: What I cannot stand is  the
``politieke geniepsigheid'' [political nastiness] of the criticism.  I  will
be very honest with hon members: there is even an element of racism  in  the
criticism. It is being said that whites are  being  driven  out  because  of
affirmative action programmes while research  is  going  backwards.  Let  me
tell hon members that that is nonsense.  There  is  nothing  of  that  kind.
However, there is a very difficult restructuring process taking  place.  But
the only way we can get this right is  to  work  together.  Trying  to  make
political gain from the argument about agricultural research  is  not  going
to get us anywhere, apart from the argument not  being  true.  Let  us  work
together on that matter.

Now, I have spent a lot of time answering  that  question.  If  hon  members
will give me a little time, rather than go home, I just want to make  a  few
observations on some of the very good speeches that  we  had  here.  It  was
really an excellent debate. I will just give a few quick reactions,  because
I cannot respond to everyone.

Rev Moatshe referred to the impact of accelerated land reform. Let  me  give
hon members an idea of issues  on  which  we  can  stand  together  and  get
something right. In the documentation for the World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development there is a very important  paragraph  on  land  reform.  At  the
moment it is still bracketed, meaning it is not accepted. If we  could  just
get that accepted. Let us stand together and hear  members'  voices.  If  we
could get that through in the WSSD  implementation  document,  we  would  be
making progress. It is like everything else: If we stand  together,  we  can
make a real difference.

Mrs Versfeld has apologised  since  she  had  to  go  to  her  constituency.
[Interjections.] She was talking about buchu. Now, I  thought  buchu  was  a
product that came in a bottle  of  brandy.  [Laughter.]  [Interjections.]  I
always drank this to support organic agriculture  in  South  Africa.  Now  I
hear one gets it in other things apart from brandy. [Interjections.]  I  can
tell hon members that it works very well in  brandy!  What  the  hon  member
said was  very  interesting.  In  actual  fact,  the  Agricultural  Research
Council is involved with research and development along the buchu  chain  of
productionÿ.ÿ.ÿ.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Deputy Minister, could  you
begin to wrap up?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  Mrs
Versfeld was only the second speaker. [Laughter.] Well, I  gave  it  a  good
shot. I wanted to answer everyone, but I will speak to people.

In conclusion, Ms Metcalfe spoke about conflicting  land  uses  in  Gauteng.
This is an extremely important problem. I can just say that it has  actually
been proven in other countries that in highly built-up areas, as we have  in
Gauteng, one can  actually  develop  green  production  areas.  I  know  the
department is doing very good work there. But we  also  have  to  fight,  as
representatives of agricultural governance in this country, to  keep  highly
productive agricultural areas.

With great respect to Mr Gelderblom - I thank him for his  excellent  speech
- hon members can go and look at what is happening in  the  Paarl-Wellington
area. That excellent production area is being built up. There must  be  ways
in which one  can  control  this.  The  land  use  management  Bill  we  are
introducing, hopefully next quarter, has  been  finalised.  This  Bill  will
provide some very good tools, also for protecting  agricultural  production.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

              KWAZULU CANE GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ACT REPEAL BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I see that the hon member  Thomson  is
this time no longer treated as a minority!

Nk  B   THOMSON:   Sihlalo,   ngiyakuhoxisa   lokhu   engikushilo   sengathi
awuphathekanga kahle.

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Sihlalo, nami angiphathekanga kahle.

Nk  B  THOMSON:  Sihlalo,  ngiyakuhoxisa  nakumama.  (Translation  of   Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I withdraw what I said, since it looks as if  it
discomforted you.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I am not comfortable with it either.

Ms B THOMSON: I also withdraw it for you, mother.]

The transformation of  agriculture  entails  ensuring  equitable  access  to
agriculture and promotes the contribution of agriculture to the  development
of all communities, society at large and the national economy. Moreover,  it
seeks  to  enhance  income,  food  security,  employment  opportunities  and
quality of life in a sustainable manner. This requires  recognition  of  the
contribution of all farmers and the sustainable utilisation of  agricultural
resources,  production  and  marketing  to  unlock   the   full   potential.
[Interjections.]

In order to arrive  at  these  objectives  all  role-players  and  different
agricultural industries are obliged to  operate  in  a  new  general  policy
framework, hence the repeal of the KwaZulu Cane Growers' Association Act  of
1981  through  the  KwaZulu  Cane  Growers'  Association  Act  Repeal  Bill.
Currently,  small-scale  KwaZulu-Natal  cane  growers  are  subject  to  the
provisions of this Act and the Sugar Act of  1998,  which  are  inconsistent
with the Constitution.

The double system that applies to small-scale cane  growers  living  in  the
territory that used to be KwaZulu is untenable and the  repeal  of  the  Act
will clearly be to the benefit of these small-scale cane growers.  In  terms
of the Act they are compelled to pay two levies, namely 60c per ton and  49c
per ton in terms of the Sugar Act.

Since sugar cane has been classified as an agricultural commodity  in  terms
of the Marketing of Agricultural Products Act  of  1996,  the  Minister  for
Agriculture and Land Affairs, who is responsible for  market-related  issues
within the industry, has  to  ensure  that  general  policy  directions  are
adhered to and that role-players are in line with Government directives.

Apart from repealing this Act, it is envisaged that with  this  Bill  assets
and money standing to the credit of the KwaZulu  Cane  Growers'  Association
at the time of the repeal of the Act will be paid over  to  a  trust  to  be
established in terms of the Trust Property Control Act  of  1998.  The  main
purpose of the trust would be manage the assets, including  the  balance  of
levies as at the commencement of the Bill, to the benefit of the  said  cane
growers who paid levies in terms of the KwaZulu  Cane  Growers'  Association
Act.
In conclusion, in the new agricultural paradigm it is  inevitable  that  the
content of existing laws will change. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 17:31.
