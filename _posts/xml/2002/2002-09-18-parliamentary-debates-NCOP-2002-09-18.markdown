                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next  sitting  of  the
Council, I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1)  notes  the  serious  questions  arising  around  the   planting   of
       genetically modified or GM crops;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  independent research done at US universities shows that GM crops
           produced lower yields  and  reduced  profits  while  using  more
           pesticides;


       (b)  many American farmers are concerned about GM crops  and  the  US
           National Family Coalition and  the  National  Farmers  Union  of
           Canada have called for a ban or moratorium on GM crops;


       (c)  studies done at an Egyptian university show GM  B-spliced  foods
           damage the intestines of laboratory rats;


       (d)  insurance companies in Australia and UK deem GM crops and  foods
           too dangerous to insure;
       (e)  the European Union has just voted for  even  stricter  GE  food-
           labelling laws;


       (f)  supermarkets in Australia and New  Zealand  are  going  GM  free
           while the Japanese, the world's biggest importer  of  food,  are
           rejecting GM foods;


       (g)  although China grows GM cotton, it  has  banned  the  commercial
           growing of GM soya, maize, wheat and rice;


       (h)  in 1998, Mexico banned the planting of GM maize to  protect  its
           indigenous maize varieties;


       (i)  Namibia and Botswana have said they will not buy  GM  food  from
           South Africa; and


       (j)  Zimbabwe and Malawi have only accepted GM food aid under  severe
           pressure while Mozambique will not even allow GM food into their
           ports or transport it across that country;
  (3) calls upon the provinces  and  the  central  government  to  place  a
       moratorium on the use of GM crops until such time  as  the  situation
       can be properly assessed.

                          FAMINE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the remarks of the UN Secretary  General's  special  envoy  for
       humanitarian needs, Mr James Morris, on  16  September  2002  to  the
       effect that the famine facing  Southern  Africa  is  far  worse  than
       initially estimated and that new evidence points  to  at  least  14,4
       million people being affected - a dramatic  increase  from  the  12,8
       million estimate made just four months ago;


  (2) also notes that -


       (a)   the  humanitarian  crisis  in  Southern  Africa  is  not   only
           devastatingly real but also worsening faster than was originally
           projected;


       (b)  the combination of disease and hunger has resulted in the untold
           tragedy of families who are  being  destroyed  by  the  HIV/Aids
           pandemic;


       (c)  worst hit are Zimbabwe and Zambia, where many households already
           have little or no food remaining;


       (d)  in both these countries a humanitarian  disaster  will  only  be
           averted if urgent action is taken; and


       (e)  the United Nations still has a major funding  shortfall  in  its
           efforts to avert this disaster; and


  (3)  requests  the  Deputy  President  to  inform  the  Council,   either
       personally or through one of the Cabinet Ministers,  as  soon  as  is
       feasible, on what steps, if any, the Government is taking in  respect
       of this Southern African famine now threatening 14,4 million people.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    SAFETY OF SA POLICE SERVICES MEMBERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) is concerned about the murders and safety of the members of the South
       African Police Service despite their goodwill in ensuring the  safety
       and security of the public at large;


  (2) notes that there are safety precautions that they should also  follow
       to ensure their safety, like wearing  bullet-proof  vests,  but  that
       this is omitted by them in most cases;


  (3) further notes that in criminal activity there  is  no  100%  absolute
       safety, but that these safety precautions have a positive  impact  on
       lowering the number of police deaths; and


  (4) resolves that the senior management of the SAPS should  regulate  the
       wearing of  bullet-proof  vests  as  an  obligation  for  all  police
       officials, especially those who deal directly with crime.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    REVIEW OF INFLATION-TARGETING POLICY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the 4th interest-rate hike by the Reserve Bank  Monetary  Policy
           Committee last week;


       (b)  that inflation factors, both locally and  globally,  indicate  a
           combined rising in inflationary pressures independent  of  rates
           policy; and


       (c)  that National Treasury adopted a policy of  inflation  targeting
           in 2000, which has literally left the Reserve Bank with no place
           to hide;


  (2) proposes that Minister Manuel -


       (a)  instead of criticising the Reserve Bank for not using the escape
           clause, which would have further damaged their credibility;


       (b)  alternatively, not criticising the Minister  of  Public  Service
           and Administration when she introduced an inevitable wage spiral
           with her Public Service wage hikes;


       (c)  undertakes to review  the  inflation-targeting  policy  and  the
           specific measures taken to target inflation.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Is  there  any
objection? There is an objection and in  the  light  of  the  objection  the
motion may not be proceeded with. The motion without notice will now  become
a notice of motion.

                 COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS OF ASBESTOS MINING

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat hierdie Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die duisende slagoffers van die asbesbedrywighede van
       vroeër waarvan die oorgrote meerderheid in die Noord-Kaap gevestig is
       of was, deur 'n Engelse hofbevel  teen  die  mynmaatskappy  Cape  PLC
       vergoeding sou ontvang het;


  (2) verder kennis neem dat daar nog geen vergoeding tot dusver betaal  is
       nie;


  (3) kennis neem dat Cape PLC beweer dat hulle  sekuriteit  by  die  banke
       geleen het, maar dat Barclays en die Bank van Skotland  traag  is  om
       die uitbetalings te doen;


  (4) hom uitspreek teen die onbegryplike verskoning vir  nie-betaling  wat
       aangevoer word en 'n beroep doen op die betrokke  Ministers  van  die
       Suid-Afrikaanse Regering om die slagoffers by te staan; en


  (5) ook kennis moet neem van die lyding van die mense wat deur  asbestose
       getref is - sedert hierdie eis begin is, het daar  reeds  300  eisers
       gesterf.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the thousands of victims of past asbestos activities,  the
       vast majority of whom are or were established in the  Northern  Cape,
       were to have received compensation on the basis of an  English  court
       order against the mining company Cape PLC;


  (2) further notes that thus far no compensation has yet been paid;
  (3) also notes that Cape PLC alleges that they  supplied  surety  to  the
       banks, but that Barclays Bank and the Bank of Scotland  are  slow  in
       making the payments;


  (4) voices its concern at the incomprehensible excuse for nonpayment that
       is being put forward and appeals to the  relevant  Ministers  of  the
       South African Government to assist the victims; and


  (5) finally notes the suffering of the people affected  by  asbestosis  -
       since the claims began, 300 claimants have already died.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        DISCIPLINARY ACTION BY SARFU

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:
  That the Council-


  (1) notes that the disciplinary committee  of  Sarfu  has  suspended  two
       prominent Springboks, André Venter and Robbie Fleck, for  seven  days
       from playing rugby;


  (2) further notes that this punishment was meted out as a result of their
       unsavoury scuffle at the completion of last week's Currie  Cup  clash
       between the Free State Cheetahs and Western  Province  and  that  the
       scuffle resulted in ugly injuries;


  (3) supports  the  disciplinary  action  taken  by  Sarfu  against  these
       Springboks; and


  (4) states categorically that  players  in  representing  their  country,
       whether in rugby or  any  other  code,  must  at  all  times  conduct
       themselves in a manner becoming role-models to younger South Africans
       aspiring to emulate their national heroes.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

        CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - FFC
                               RECOMMENDATIONS

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I think you must understand that  this  is  my
first time to speak after the Chamber has been so renovated.  It  should  be
understood in  that  context  that  I  inserted  the  card  wrongly.  I  was
disempowered. Yes, it is true indeed.

Chairperson,  colleagues  and  special  delegates  from  provinces  who  are
present here today,  the  report  we  are  seeking  to  table  as  a  select
committee  today  deals  with  the   Financial   and   Fiscal   Commission's
recommendations  for  the  financial  year  2003-04.  I  think  it  is  very
important for members to take cognisance of that because from time  to  time
when these issues are raised, members say they  do  not  know  what  formula
informs the allocation of resources among the three spheres  of  Government.
So it is quite important that members understand exactly what  is  the  role
of this recommendation in this instance. The report has been tabled.  It  is
in the ATC today, so members can go through the report if they want  to  get
more details about it. However, I will touch  on  a  few  issues  and  other
members of the committee will add.

Section 214(2) of the Constitution states that when the  recommendations  of
the FFC are considered, the following factors in paragraphs (a) to (j)  must
be taken into account: One, the national interests - and the FFC makes  such
proposals; two, any provision that must be made in respect of  the  national
debt and other national obligations; three, the needs and interests  of  the
national government, determined by objective criteria;  four,  the  need  to
ensure that the provinces and  municipalities  are  able  to  provide  basic
services and perform the functions  allocated  to  them;  five,  the  fiscal
capacity and efficiency of provinces and municipalities  -  their  ways  and
means of being able to raise  funds  other  than  what  they  get  from  the
national Government. It is quite important that  the  FFC  takes  that  into
consideration in coming up with the formula; six, the development and  other
needs of provinces, local government  and  municipalities;  seven,  economic
disparities within and among the provinces - we all know that all  provinces
as  they  currently  stand  and  in  many  respects  still  represent   many
disparities, inequalities and inequities, so in coming up  with  a  formula,
all these things must be taken into  consideration;  eight,  obligations  of
the provinces and municipalities in terms  of  national  legislation;  nine,
the desirability of stable and predictable allocations  of  revenue  shares.
In this instance the division of revenue seeks then to give effect  to  this
as per what is demanded in  the  Constitution;  and  lastly,  the  need  for
flexibility in responding to  emergencies  or  other  temporary  needs,  and
other factors based on similar objective criteria. All these things must  be
taken into account.

So it is quite important that when we talk about this formula  we  bear  the
section 214(a)-(j) objectives in mind and  that  they  must  be  taken  into
account when coming up with this formula.  I  just  want  to  touch  on  few
things. With regard to the revenue of provinces, the  document  of  the  FFC
makes recommendations that national  Government  should  give  up  room  and
allow provinces more scope to tax. I think what must be understood  in  this
context is that,  as  I  said  earlier,  there  are  a  lot  of  inequities,
inequalities and disparities amongst provinces.  So  whatever  decision  one
takes in giving more tax powers to provinces, one  has  to  understand  that
Gauteng and the Western Cape, as they stand now, will continue to  be  at  a
better advantage than all the other rural provinces combined. So  all  these
things are very, very important in my view.

What is currently prevailing in the provinces is that road traffic  revenues
are currently what provinces are able to generate. But as we noted from  the
inter-governmental fiscal review last year, many provinces  still  have  not
adjusted their own revenue in terms of car licences and all those  kinds  of
things  in  making  sure  that  they  generate  these  kinds  of   revenues.
Therefore,  the  question  of  them   asking   for   more   powers   becomes
questionable. Secondly, they still can be  able  to  generate  revenue  from
hospital and patients' fees. I think the improvement of  hospitals  and  how
the revenues are collected in hospitals become important if  provinces  want
to see themselves collecting more revenue. Lastly,  they  also  can  collect
revenue on horse-racing and gambling. I am sure a  lot  of  hon  members  do
undertake such activities and I think it is in the  interest  of  provincial
government for people to go for horse-betting and  gambling  and  so  forth,
but obviously they must not become addicted.

Basically, within these parameters  I  have  just  outlined,  provinces  are
currently able to collect revenues, but they are not  collecting  and  using
the scope and the framework they  are  allocated  with.  I  think  also  the
document of the FFC outlines  the  fact  that  there  is  a  Provincial  Tax
Regulation Process Act in  place,  which  provinces  can  use,  within  that
framework, to propose  to  the  Minister  through  the  Budget  Council  and
further request us that they want  to  introduce  more  taxes.  Not  even  a
single province has taken up this proposal in this instance. I think  it  is
quite important, as I said earlier on, if one looks at the issue of  raising
revenue. In provinces these issues are taken into  account.  When  provinces
want more powers, what is it that they are doing with their current powers?

The other issue that is  being  raised  in  the  document  is  around  local
government proposals. The  document  talks  about  municipal  borrowing  and
financial markets, as there is a lesser appetite for the private sector  and
for a lot of lending institutions  to  lend  money  to  the  provincial  and
national  governments.  However,  there   is   bigger   appetite   for   the
municipalities as they are getting more mature. So  it  is  quite  important
that there are proper rules and  frameworks  that  govern  this  kind  of  a
borrowing - if it has to happen. It should not be a willy-nilly  thing.  The
committee does stand by the view  that  municipalities,  as  time  goes  on,
should be allowed to borrow, but should be allowed  to  borrow  for  capital
expenditure and things that cannot be budgeted for within their own  revenue
mechanisms or from equitable share or conditional grants.

Secondly, it talks about the FFC's recommendation that primary  health  care
should be decentralised towards the district municipalities and they  should
be the service authorities. I think the committee also agrees  that  primary
health care should be dealt with at a district level, because I  think  when
one visits the constituency and clinics around our constituencies - I  found
that  in  my  constituency  -  one  finds  that  those  under  the  care  of
municipalities are better off than those at the provincial  level.  I  think
it does make sense that such primary health care, in particular,  should  be
dealt with at district level. The  mechanisms  of  transferring  such  funds
must be followed by functions and the committee supports that.

The third issue around the local government recommendations relates  to  the
remuneration of councillors. I think what is being proposed here -  and  the
committee agrees with this recommendation - is that  councillors  should  be
remunerated from the municipalities' own revenue and/or from  the  equitable
share of the different municipalities, because if councillors are  going  to
be paid directly from the national equitable share or  from  the  provincial
equitable share, then they should be able to account to the people  who  pay
them. Therefore, in that instance municipalities do not  account  to  either
provincial or National Government and it  does  make  a  lot  of  sense  for
municipalities to pay their own councillors from their own equitable share.

The document also deals with the restructuring  of  the  electricity  sector
and so forth and my colleagues will deal with some  of  these  issues  at  a
later stage.

I think the FFC has consistently raised the question  around  the  usage  of
the  contingency  reserves,  which  usually  are   funds   put   aside   for
unforeseeable and unavoidable circumstances, like  the  disasters  and  many
other things which might happen during the course  of  the  financial  year.
These funds are reserved for that, but the FFC has been  calling,  and  even
again  in  this  proposal  they  are  calling,  for  objective  criteria  to
determine how these resources are supposed to  be  utilised.  The  committee
has expressed a view on that. Since I do not want that to take  up  most  of
my time, I want to go to the recommendations. My colleagues  can  deal  with
some of these issues later on.

There is a proposal around the restructuring of the social security  system,
which has been dealt with to some extent by the  Taylor  Commission  and  is
currently before Cabinet. It seeks to say that the  social  security  funds,
in particular the pension payout of different kinds and  payments  of  Child
Support Grants and  all  those  kind  of  things,  should  be  removed  from
provinces to national Government. The FFC makes such  a  recommendation  and
the committee did not take any particular view on the matter  -  but  it  is
one of the recommendations that the FFC has made.  I  am  not  sure  exactly
what kind of disparities and what impact it will have on provinces  if  such
function is taken away from provinces back to national Government.

The last few issues I want to talk  about  are  around  the  review  of  the
equitable share formula that is currently in existence. There is a need  for
the review as and when the new data is available. The new data,  as  we  all
know, will become available sometime this year as and when  the  results  of
Census 2000 are issued.  It  will  be  important  for  this  formula  to  be
reviewed, because increasingly  we  have  seen  that  there  is  a  lack  of
information on a number of things which  are  supposed  to  inform  how  the
revenue  is  supposed  to  be  divided  throughout  the  country.  In   some
instances, one will find that other provinces have more  people  and  others
have more poor people than the others, but the allocation of resources  does
not  live  up  to  that  reality  and  therefore  the  review  pending   the
availability of the necessary data becomes a  relevant  point  to  raise  in
this instance.

The last two issues I want to raise relate to the recommendations  that  the
committee has made on several occasions. The FFC  has  consistently  made  a
recommendation that some of the conditional grants should be phased out  and
we fully concur. Those grants must be removed, because, in one  way  or  the
other, if  conditional  grants  are  going  to  continue  to  increase,  the
autonomy of the provinces to have  control  of  particular  funds  is  taken
away. Those particular grants should  find  ways  and  mechanisms  of  being
incorporated  into  the  equitable  share  of  provinces.  However,  on  the
question around the conditional grants on  HIV/Aids,  we  said  that  we  do
agree that it should remain as a conditional grant because we  do  not  have
enough information.

Earlier on, when we were debating Statistics South Africa's Budget Vote,  we
said a mortality study was being conducted by  the  three  agencies.  It  is
seeking to try and find out what exactly South Africans are dying  from  and
it has got a particular timeframe. As  and  when  this  information  becomes
available, it will be important that the decision of  whether  the  HIV/Aids
programme funded through conditional grants  or  from  any  other  mechanism
should - pending this information that I just talked about - be reviewed.

Lastly, there is  a  request  from  provinces  and  even  by  municipalities
themselves that central government and provinces should try  and  find  ways
and mechanisms of helping municipalities that  do  not  have  capacities  to
build these capacities. I do not think that that request and outcry  is  out
of order, because section 154(1) of  the  Constitution  does  indicate  that
national and provincial governments should play a role in  capacitating  and
ensuring that municipalities do have the capacity. In the light of  the  new
demarcation that has just taken place, many municipalities  are  finding  it
difficult to have capacity. I think it  is  in  our  interest  to  see  them
having capacity and even to deliver the basic services to  the  poor  people
that we are all representing here.

Lastly, the functions and powers relating  to  the  distribution  of  social
grants must remain with  provinces,  as  I  have  just  said.  In  our  view
capacity  constraints  exist  at  different   levels   and   some   national
departments, in my view, do not have capacities. In some instances, some  of
these departments  do  not  necessarily  transfer  funds  according  to  the
division  of  revenue  transfer  processes  and  therefore  they   frustrate
municipalities in terms of delivering. Therefore, in my view the failure  of
a national department to transfer funds is not because  of  the  failure  of
the municipality, but is because of a lack of  capacity  in  the  particular
department at national level. I think it is important  to  qualify  when  we
talk about the lack of capacity in other  spheres  of  government.  I  think
from now onwards, we must move away from  just  making  generalisations  and
try and find mechanisms of making sure that we help where  we  are  supposed
to help.

And lastly, Chair, the question around the ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr L M Mushwana):  Order!  This  is  the
fifth ``lastly''. I am not sure when you will stop.  [Laughter.]  Your  time
has expired. [Applause.]

Mr J L THERON:  Mr  Chairperson,  the  submission  of  this  report  on  the
Financial and Fiscal Commission, the FFC, is made in response to  a  request
to the FFC from the parliamentary Select Committee on  Finance  as  part  of
the public hearings on the Division of Revenue Bill.

The terms of reference for the FFC were the assessment  and  performance  of
conditional grants during the previous  year;  the  output  of  grants;  the
flow, timing and size of grants; the capacity  at  national  and  provincial
government departments to facilitate the allocation, operation  and  running
of these grant programmes and other  related  matters  pertaining  to  these
grants.

The commission noted that it did not give conditional  grants  any  detailed
treatment in its previous submissions on the Division of  Revenue  Bill.  It
is therefore the intention of the commission to pay more  attention  to  the
use of conditional grants in its  future  submissions  on  the  Division  of
Revenue Bill.

I now want to look at the Financial and Fiscal Commission's position on  the
use of conditional grants. The FFC noted, in  its  recommendations  for  the
2001-2004 MTEF cycle, that the use of conditional grants should  be  limited
and promote constitutional intentions with respect to  decentralisation  and
the principles of good governance applicable to subnational governments.

Furthermore, the FFC noted  the  importance  of  conditional  grants  as  an
instrument for speeding up access to  basic  services,  given  the  national
norms and standards.  Of  course,  conditional  grants  are  used  also  for
capacity-building  and  skills  development  in  provinces  and   at   local
government level. The DP supports these  objectives  of  the  FFC  regarding
conditional grants.

The objectives of the conditional grant  ...  [Interjections.]  Ek  dink  jy
moet liewer luister en nie so baie praat  nie!  [I  think  that  you  should
rather listen and talk less!]

The objectives pertaining to conditional grants, as identified  by  National
Treasury, are the following: ensuring  the  fulfilment  of  national  policy
objectives  involving  the  provision  of  standard  levels  of  access   to
government services; compensating for  interjurisdictional  spillovers,  for
example tertiary hospital grants; and  effecting  transition  by  supporting
capacity-building and structural adjustments at subnational  level.  We  can
note here, for instance, the new Disaster Management Bill  that  is  on  its
way. A lot of capacity-building and skills development are necessary in  the
provinces and that is why we have these grants going to  the  provinces  and
local government.  A  further  objective  of  the  Treasury  is  to  address
backlogs and regional disparities in economic and social infrastructure.

The types of conditional grant can be  classified  in  the  following  ways.
There are block grants, service  delivery  grants,  traditional  grants  and
special allocation grants.

Let me turn to the current conditional grants framework. The fact that  both
provincial  and  national  government  are  accountable  for  the   use   of
conditional grants has been cited as the major cause of the inefficiency  of
the conditional grant system.  Reforms  that  have  been  put  in  place  at
National Treasury, coupled with the advent of the Public Finance  Management
Act, are expected to deal with accountability and performance issues.

Let me refer to the size of the provincial conditional  grants.  Conditional
grants constituted between 15% (in 1998-1999)  and  13%  (in  2001-2002)  of
transfers from national to sub-national governments.  Approximately  85%  of
conditional grants were  attached  to  the  provincial  sphere.  Conditional
grants constituted 13% of  provincial  expenditure  in  1999-2000  and  just
below 12% of provincial expenditure this year.

Whilst the relative importance of conditional grants to  provincial  budgets
is declining, it is rising for municipalities. The  relative  importance  of
conditional grants varies  between  functions.  Conditional  grants  finance
relatively  small  portions  of  the  Education  and  Welfare  budgets.   By
contrast, over 20% of  the  Health  budget  is  funded  through  conditional
grants. The Housing budget is almost  entirely  funded  through  conditional
grants.

When looking at the composition of provincial  conditional  grants  for  the
financial  year  2000-2001,  41%  of  the  total  value  of  the  provincial
conditional grants was generated by the Health sector.  The  second  highest
allocation was for the  housing  fund  at  23,9%  to  the  total.  This  was
followed by the  National  Treasury's  supplementary  grants  allocation  of
about 17,6%. In  2001-2002  the  allocation  to  HIV/Aids  under  the  three
departments  of  Education,  Health  and  Welfare  amounted   to   0,9%   of
conditional grants to provinces, up from 0,4% in 2000-2001.

I now want to concentrate a little on the grants for HIV/Aids. The  HIV/Aids
grant was initiated in 2000-2001 in order to assist provinces  in  providing
life-skills  training  in  all  primary  and  secondary  schools;  providing
increased access to voluntary  counselling  and  testing  and,  lastly,  for
developing and piloting community-based care models. The responsibility  for
achieving the objectives of this grant lies with the departments of  Health,
Social Development and Education, although the Health department  plays  the
major role in co-ordinating this.

There have been  problems  of  underspending  since  the  inception  of  the
HIV/Aids  grants,  but  the  extent  of  such  underspending  is  narrowing.
Problems  that  have  been  identified  include  a   lack   of   human   and
infrastructure capacity; lack of appropriate  skills;  NGOs  still  learning
the process of submitting  appropriate  business  plans;  lack  of  synergy;
transfer payments disbursed late; inadequate administrative support, etc.

In conclusion, the DP and the DA support  the  submissions  of  the  FFC  as
discussed above and  therefore  support  the  committee's  report  regarding
these aspects. [Applause.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Mr Chairperson,  hon  members,  I  must  also  add  to  this
debate. The Financial and Fiscal Commission  has  once  again  executed  its
constitutional responsibility with distinction. The FFC  is  entrusted  with
the responsibility of making recommendations on  policy  matters  pertaining
to intergovernmental and fiscal relations.

A key feature of the FFC report is  that  the  commission  addresses  issues
arising from its submission of May 2000 and also follows up on some  of  the
proposals made in the submission on the Division of Revenue 2002-2003.

Also covered in the report are recent developments in the  intergovernmental
fiscal relations  system  relating  to  social  security  reform  and  local
government. The submission emphasises the importance  of  addressing  fiscal
issues across all spheres of Government.

The report introduces the theme of cross-cutting  issues,  which  relate  to
the equitable share and affect all three spheres of Government. Examples  of
cross-cutting  issues  that  are  covered  in  the   report   are,   namely,
restructuring of electricity; the  distribution  industry;  implications  of
HIV/Aids for the health, welfare and  education  sectors;  framework  for  a
comprehensive social security programme; and disaster management.

With regard to the FFC submission on Division of Revenue 2002-2003, the  FFC
notes that Government response was generally  positive.  The  FFC  proposals
pursue  an  approach  that  seeks  to  translate  constitutional   provision
services  into  a  formula-based  approach  for  the  division  of  revenue.
Government's view is that such an approach would be impracticable.

The following are some of the reasons; namely, lack of  concise  definitions
of constitutionally mandated basic services  associated  with  each  sphere;
absence of objectively determined norms and  standards  for  basic  services
and other  constitutional  functions;  unavailability  of  data  that  would
enable the complete adoption of such an approach.

Both national Government and the FFC, however, agree  that  the  process  of
regularly reviewing and  adapting  the  formula  should  be  maintained.  In
addition national Government holds the view, which the FFC  shares,  that  a
review of the current division of revenue formula  should  take  place  only
once the results of Census 2001 are released.

In the past, local government was essentially  an  extension  of  provincial
government, and it was  widely  believed  that  provincial  and/or  national
Government  would  intervene  to  support  a  municipality  that  ran   into
financial troubles. Black municipal structures had little or  no  access  to
credit, built much less of an infrastructure, and also  provided  far  fewer
services.

Today  the  environment  of  the   municipalities   is   vastly   different.
Municipalities have amalgamated in  a  manner  that  includes  well-serviced
areas  and  unserviced  areas.  Infrastructure  and  services  must  now  be
provided to all citizens, and this will demand a great deal  of  investment.
National policy is that local government should provide the  bulk  of  these
services, and that private investment,  both  equity  and  debt,  should  be
attracted to meet additional needs.

This policy makes it necessary for legislation to  stipulate  the  borrowing
powers  of   municipalities   unambiguously.   Government   has   repeatedly
emphasised the fact that private finance will  need  to  form  an  important
source of funding for capital investments in the municipal sector.

Municipalities will have to raise private finance on  their  own  books  and
bear the responsibility of  servicing  the  debt.  This  policy  shift  from
national guarantees to  local  responsibilities  for  private  debt  is  the
cornerstone of the municipal finance Bill currently  debated  in  Parliament
by affected committees. This Bill clarifies the rights  and  obligations  of
borrowers and creditors. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Geagte Voorsitter en  kollegas,  die  Finansiële  en  Fiskale
Kommissie het die mandaat, kragtens artikel 9 van die Wet op  Interregerings
- Fiskale  Betrekkinge  van  1997,  om  10  maande  voor  die  Minister  van
Finansies se Begrotinsgrede voorleggings  oor  die  verdeling  van  inkomste
tussen die drie vlakke van regering aan die Parlement te maak.
Hoewel die Minister nie verplig is om die FFK se aanbevelings in ag te  neem
nie, moet hy  tog  met  die  FFK  oorleg  pleeg  en  op  dié  instelling  se
aanbevelings reageer.

Dit is  dan  ook  nodig  dat  daar  wyd  oor  die  FFK  se  voorleggings  en
aanbevelings  met  rolspelers  op  nasionale,   provinsiale   en   plaaslike
regeringsvlakke gekonsulteer word en is dit ook die doel  met  die  openbare
oorlegplegingsvergaderings wat vanjaar weer eens  deur  die  Gekose  Komitee
oor Finansies in die verskillende provinsies gefasiliteer is. Die  doel  was
en is steeds om met hierdie soort oorlegplegingsvergaderings  interaksie  en
debat oor die aanbevelings te bevorder.

Belangrike en selfs brandende aspekte wat  dringende  aandag  verg,  het  in
vanjaar  se  FFK  voorleggings  en   toeligtingsessies   na   vore   getree.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson and colleagues in terms  section  9  of  the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act of 1997,  the  Financial  and  Fiscal
Commission has the mandate to make submissions to Parliament  regarding  the
division of revenue between the three tiers of government 10  months  before
the Minister of Finance's Budget Speech.

Although the Minister is not  compelled  to  take  into  account  the  FFC's
recommendations, he does have  to  consult  the  FFC  and  respond  to  this
institution's recommendations.

It is then also necessary to consult widely on  the  FFC's  submissions  and
recommendations  with  role-players  at  national,  provincial   and   local
government levels and this is also the purpose of  the  public  consultation
meetings, which were once again  facilitated  by  the  Select  Committee  on
Finance in the various provinces this year. The aim  was  and  still  is  to
promote interaction and debate about the recommendations with this  type  of
consultative meeting.

Important and even burning aspects that require urgent attention emerged  in
this year's FFC submissions and information sessions.]
Consensus on the policy framework for municipal borrowing is of  the  utmost
importance. Private - sector investment in local  government  infrastructure
is vitally important for improved delivery of basic services.  There  should
therefore be some flexibility which allows easy access to loans. A  lack  of
uniformity in the local government sphere and the consequent unequal  access
to finance markets, which is highlighted as a burning issue,  is  recognised
in the FFC's report. An assymmetrical approach to  the  municipal  borrowing
market,  with  different  municipalities  being  treated   differently,   is
emphasised by the FFC.

Die  aard  van  vanjaar  se  aanbevelings  val  binne  die  bestek  van  die
aanbevelings wat die FFK reeds  in  die  jaar  2000  vir  die  mediumtermyn-
uitgaweraamwerk oor die betrokke siklus gemaak  het.  Hul  aanbevelings  vir
die volgende fiskale jaar moet binne daardie siklus gesien word.

Sleutelelemente van die aanbevelings in verband met plaaslike bestuur  sluit
in dié ten opsigte van munisipale  lenings  en  finansieringsmarkte  waaroor
aanbeveel word dat daar 'n kombinasie van  markdissipline  en  'n  op  reëls
gefundeerde benadering moet wees.

Op plaaslike regeringsvlak is daar ook, onder meer, na die  wetsontwerp  oor
munisipale finansiële bestuur, die verdeling van magte  en  funksies  tussen
distriks-  en  plaaslike  munisipaliteite,  die  vergoeding  van  munisipale
raadslede  en  herstrukturering  van  die  elektrisiteitsverspreidingsbedryf
verwys. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.]

[The nature of this year's recommendations falls within  the  scope  of  the
recommendations which the FFC already made in the year 2000 for the  Medium-
Term Expenditure Framework for the relevant cycle. The  recommendations  for
the following fiscal year must be viewed within that cycle.

Key elements of  the  recommendations  regarding  local  management  include
those dealing with municipal loans  and  finance  markets,  with  regard  to
which it is  recommended  but  there  should  be  a  combination  of  market
discipline and a rules-based approach.

At the local government level references are also made, inter alia,  to  the
Bill  on  municipal  financial  management,  the  division  of  powers   and
functions between district and local  municipalities,  the  remuneration  of
the  municipal  councillors  and  the  restructuring  of   the   electricity
distribution industry.]

With regard to provincial government, the provincial  tax  regulation  Bill,
early childhood development and HIV/Aids were highlighted.

Another aspect of the FFC report that needs mentioning is the assessment  of
municipal   disaster   management   funding   in   the   context   of    the
intergovernmental system as a whole. The introduction of a  central  funding
mechanism  for  disaster  management  and  the   appropriate   division   of
responsibilities between district and local municipalities is recommended.

Reaksies uit die provinsies op die FFK se voorstelle behels onder  meer  dat
'n hersiening van die billike inkomsteverdeling die data van Sensus 2001  in
ag moet neem; dat  die  grense  van  streekselektrisiteitsverspreiders,  die
sogenaamde SEV's, in ooreenstemming met munisipale grense gebring word;  dat
die voorstelle dat munisipaliteite vergoed word vir die verliese  wat  hulle
as gevolg van oorplasings na die SEV's mag ly, verwelkom  word;  dat  sekere
voorstelle vir die strukturering van  rampbefondsing  gemaak  word,  en  dat
munisipale  raadslede  vergoed  word  uit  munisipale  inkomste  waarby  hul
billike aandeeltoekennings ingesluit is.

Die Gekose Komitee se gevolgtrekkings en aanbevelings, soos reeds  deur  die
agb voorsitter van dié komitee in haar rede vermeld, asook  die  aanvaarding
van die verslag, word deur die Nuwe NP gesteun.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Reactions from the provinces to the FFC's  proposals  entail,  inter  alia,
that a review of the equitable revenue division  should  take  into  account
the data from Census 2001;  that  the  boundaries  of  regional  electricity
distributors, the so-called REDs, should be brought in line  with  municipal
boundaries; that the proposals that municipalities be  remunerated  for  the
losses that they might suffer as a result  of  transfers  to  the  REDs,  be
welcomed; that certain proposals for the structuring of disaster funding  be
made, and that municipal councillors be remunerated from  municipal  revenue
in which the equitable share allocations are included.

The  select  committee's  conclusions  and   recommendations,   as   already
mentioned by the hon chairperson of this committee in her  speech,  as  well
as the adoption of the report, is supported by the New NP.]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, Deputy Minister and hon  members,  I  endorse  the
view by my colleagues that the Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission  has  once
again executed its constitutional responsibility with distinction.  The  FFC
has taken the debate on provincial contingency reserves much further.

Originally the  FFC  proposed  that  a  study  be  undertaken  to  determine
objective criteria for the utilisation  of  national  contingency  reserves.
The FFC expressed its concern that the use of contingency  funds  ultimately
affects the amount of money available for equitable share funding, and  that
provinces need financial stability, predictability  and  flexibility.  Hence
the FFC has proposed criteria for the use of contingency reserves.

The National Treasury's response was that the concern raised by the FFC  was
important, but argued that the current process  for  allocating  contingency
reserve funds involves substantial consultation.

Government maintains an open consultative process for  dividing  contingency
reserve funds, taking into account unforeseeable  and  unavoidable  spending
commitments across spheres. National Government is not convinced that it  is
more efficient for every province to have its own contingency fund.

Government will nonetheless explore, with the FFC, opportunities to  improve
mechanisms for provincial contingency reserves. This will  include  the  use
of criteria for allocating unexpended contingency amounts.

Government will consult with the FFC and  make  appropriate  recommendations
to amend the Public Finance Management Act and/or its regulations to  ensure
stability and practicability in the use of  contingency  reserves.  The  FFC
has, in its submission currently before us, succeeded in taking  the  debate
on contingency funds much further.

In its submission, the FFC explains that  contingency  reserve  is  deducted
from nationally collected revenues before equitable  shares  are  allocated.
That is, it is ``top-sliced''. This means that the reserve is not  allocated
to one sphere of Government but is available for specified contingencies.
Because it is administered nationally, it is  often  called  the  ``national
contingency reserve''. This, as the FFC correctly points out, is  misleading
because it implies that the reserve is allocated  to  the  national  sphere.
For this reason, the top-sliced  contingency  reserve  is  referred  to,  in
their submission, as the ``central contingency reserve''. We as  members  of
the Select Committee  on  Finance  welcome  this  shift  in  our  conceptual
understanding of national contingency reserve.

The paradox is that this  improved  understanding  of  national  contingency
reserve weakens the  case  of  the  second  recommendation  of  the  FFC  on
contingency reserves. The FFC recommends that provinces  and  municipalities
should have their own contingency funding strategies, appropriate  to  their
own circumstances. It argues that if there is a central contingency  reserve
for adverse  economic  and  natural  disasters,  should  not  provinces  and
municipalities budget for contingencies?

At present the situation is that four provinces  have  made  provisions  for
contingency reserves. In addition, a  fifth  province  has  budgeted  for  a
surplus,  implying  that  the  forward  revenue  estimates  have  not   been
appropriated in  their  entirety.  In  Gauteng  99%  of  the  total  revenue
estimates  for  the  2001-02  budget  year  has  been  made  available   for
expenditure only. One province, that is Mpumalanga, has budgeted both for  a
surplus and a contingency reserve. Only one province, the  Free  State,  has
the contingency reserve set aside as  a  separate  item,  Vote  13,  on  its
Provincial Appropriation Bill.

As a member of the Select Committee on Finance, I am inclined  to  take  the
view that the creation of a provincial and municipal contingency  fund  will
not work, for three reasons: Firstly, if the amount allocated is  excessive,
this could result in nonspending. This nonspending could  impact  negatively
on our national agenda of enhancing delivery of social  services;  secondly,
since both provincial and local government could access  the  reserves  from
the national contingency, creation of  additional  contingency  reserves  by
other  spheres  would  be  an  unnecessary  duplication  of  functions;  and
thirdly,  this  proliferation  of   contingency   reserves   creates   major
difficulties for the provincial legislatures' and municipalities'  oversight
functions.  An  important  implication  of  the  simultaneous  creation   of
national, provincial and municipal contingency reserves  is  that  provinces
and  municipalities  have  increased  discretion  on  the   allocation   and
distribution of provincial and local government equitable shares.

When  a  province  and/or  a  municipality  appropriates   an   amount   for
contingency reserves, it means that such  a  province  has  more  discretion
over the use of its reserves and, in a sense, over its share  of  nationally
raised equitable share. This increases  the  oversight  responsibilities  of
provincial legislatures and municipalities.

Therefore, we in the Select Committee on Finance adopt  the  new  conceptual
approach of the FFC, namely the central contingency reserve, but argue  that
it should be the only reserve fund for  contingency  purposes  and  that  it
should be accessible to all spheres of Government. [Applause.]

Ms J M L FUBBS (Gauteng): Honourable Chairperson and members  of  the  NCOP,
we certainly support the principles,  the  spirit  and  the  detail  of  the
report of the NCOP's Select Committee on Finance. One of the points made  by
the chairperson of that committee is the importance of  developing  capacity
in all three spheres of government.

In the division of our resources our Constitution entrenches our  commitment
to create a  society  in  which  all  our  people  can  develop  their  full
potential in an environment that works to eliminate  poverty.  Indeed  South
Africa has moved from a highly centralised system of governance to  a  post-
apartheid system characterised  by  three  distinctive,  interdependent  and
interrelated spheres of government. It is a system that  introduced  to  the
world the concept of  co-operative  governance.  It  is  a  system  that  is
afrocentric rather than eurocentric. It is a political system  that  strives
to eliminate imbalances in the  delivery  of  social  services  in  all  our
provinces.

The constitutional role of the Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission  seeks  to
actually underpin this commitment in the Constitution. Thus the division  of
resources should be informed by the need to avoid conflict, to preserve  the
peace, national unity and also the need for all  spheres  of  government  to
exercise their powers in a manner that does not encroach on  the  functional
or institutional integrity of a government in any other sphere.

South Africa has a history of fighting for human rights in  public  finance,
and this occurs within the context of  human  rights.  Our  Bill  of  Rights
provides for such a framework. And indeed this particular submission of  the
FFC seeks to underpin the Bill of Rights. The proposals of the FFC that  are
contained in the Division of Revenue have made a valiant effort  to  address
the equitable  arrangements  that  impact  on  the  delivery  of  resources,
especially those linked to sections 27 and 29. That is, the  right  to  have
access to health care, food, water and social  security  and  the  right  to
basic education.

Although decentralising basic public  service  provision  to  provincial  or
local government can enhance efficiency, these basic public services are  at
the same time among the most  important  policy  instruments  for  achieving
national equity goals. These goals, explicitly stated or  not,  include  the
aim that people ought  to  have  equal  access  to  these  opportunities  of
education, housing, health care and socio-economic security.

The FFC proposals on the pressures faced by some municipalities  to  provide
effective services actually  complement  National  Treasury's  agreement  to
review the formula  after  this  medium-term  expenditure  period.  However,
Gauteng differed from the FFC on the opinion that  the  delivery  of  social
grants  should  be  undertaken  by  National  Government,  given  that   the
motivation of a lack of capacity was applicable  to  all  three  spheres  of
government. The proposals of the FFC  on  the  Disaster  Management  Funding
were supported. Gauteng also welcomed the review by the FFC of  the  Central
Contingency Reserve, but noted that  section  6  of  the  National  Treasury
Regulations on the  PFMA  does  not  provide  specific  criteria  to  define
unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditure.

With respect to the cross-cutting issues,  we  have  already  addressed  the
social grants in particular and the  issue  of  insufficient  capacity.  One
also wishes to refer to the Intergovernmental Fiscal  Relation  System.  The
increasing pick-up of constitutional  mandates  requires  a  review  of  the
IGFR. However, in the opinion of Gauteng,  any  such  changes  that  may  be
envisaged should be undertaken with caution, and preferably at  the  end  of
the current MTEF period.  Before  this  is  done,  what  should  come  under
examination should be the several proposals that we have also  seen  in  the
NCOP report.

In respect of the  capital  grants  and  the  proposals  made  by  the  FFC,
certainly it does present a  constructive  framework  in  which  to  analyse
infrastructural needs. However, it may be useful for the FFC  to  take  into
account the National Treasury's concerns with the  capital  grant  proposal.
Indeed the commission  could  perhaps  expand  its  capital  grant  research
project to include the refinement  and  extension  and  development  of  the
current model  to  encompass  other  basic  infrastructural  services  being
provided by provinces and municipalities.

In respect to the financial implications, Gauteng believes  that  there  are
no serious financial implications for the fiscus because  many  of  the  FFC
proposals  deal  with  policy  options  that  are  already   in   operation.
Nevertheless, one can refer to the tariff support  to  low-income  consumers
to be financed primarily by a national grant to REDs for  the  provision  of
free electricity and, to a lesser extent,  the  consumer  cross-subsidy  and
also the proposal for capital electrification for  low-income  consumers  to
be financed by National Government and that provision  for  this  should  be
made in the MTEF estimates. The reference to  comprehensive  review  of  the
social security system may also have financial  implications,  depending  on
the finance models proposed.

Notwithstanding this, the province was of the opinion that  these  proposals
do much to broaden the options available to National Treasury. Many  of  our
recommendations have been captured in the NCOP report. Suffice to  say  that
one of our great concerns was that the problems that exist in the  provinces
are equally  applicable  to  the  national  sphere  of  government,  so  the
centralisation of payment of social grants would not alleviate the  problem.
It is incumbent on the National Government  to  set  minimum  standards  for
defining the right of access to social security and progressive  realisation
of constitutional obligations.

There is also  a  need  for  more  integrated  planning  and  allocation  at
national and provincial spheres of government  for  more  effective  use  of
allocations. The process of implementation  thus  becomes  critical.  Indeed
this would address the cross-cutting challenges  posed  by  HIV/Aids,  among
other issues.
The regional electricity distributors boundaries  should  also  be  aligned,
and indeed that is directly contained in the NCOP  report.  Suffice  to  say
that we support the report again and we do believe that this FFC  submission
has done much to expand our thinking in how  to  be  more  creative  in  the
models we develop, but also how to  be  more  realistic  in  the  challenges
facing our country.

Mr M I MAKOELA: Thank you hon Deputy Chairperson, hon Deputy  Minister.  Let
me limit my discussion of the  FFC  proposals  on  provincial  taxes,  which
proposals are as follows:  That  criteria  against  which  the  Minister  of
Finance  measures  provincial  tax  proposals  should  be  specified,   that
provinces should be allowed maximum flexibility  in  determining  tax  rates
within tax bands and that guidelines should be developed with regard to  tax
room and equalisation measures where certain  taxes  have  implications  for
the  equitable  share  revenue  pool  and  the   regulations   for   dispute
resolution, especially where a province may fail to reach an agreement  with
Sars on certain tax proposals, should be specified, and to include a  clause
for dealing with the impact on  local  government  finances  of  a  proposed
provincial tax or surcharge. Quickly then, Chairperson, in response  to  the
above recommendations I would say that  provinces  cannot  impose  corporate
income tax, Vat, excise levies or property  taxes.  And  although  provinces
cannot impose personal income tax, they may nevertheless impose a  surcharge
on personal income tax and on the fuel levy.

However, in terms  of  the  Constitution  the  right  to  impose  a  tax  or
surcharge  is  subject  to  national  legislation  and   national   economic
objectives. National Government has enacted the  Provincial  Tax  Regulation
Process Act of 2001.  Under  this  regulatory  process  national  Government
reviews each proposed provincial tax for consistency with national  economic
and fiscal policy and to ensure that it does not have any  adverse  economic
consequences for other provinces.

If national Government approves the provincial tax option, that tax  becomes
part of an allowed list of taxes that any province  may  then  impose,  once
enacted by each provincial legislature. The approval  process  requires  the
national Government to consult with provinces and  with  the  constitutional
Financial and Fiscal Commission. The allowed list will be  in  the  form  of
the legislation adopted by national Parliament. In  general  provinces  have
accepted that the surcharge on the personal income tax is not  feasible  for
the foreseeable future. Currently options considered include  the  surcharge
on the fuel levy and some smaller taxes.

The introduction of any new taxes to provinces may require an adjustment  in
the revenue-sharing formula, to prevent poor provinces from  losing  out  to
richer provinces. In addition, given the  success  of  the  central  revenue
collection agency, Sars, there is a strong preference  for  any  substantial
provincial taxes in future to be  collected  by  this  agency,  rather  than
setting up new revenue services in provinces.

Local  government   has   more   fiscal   capacity   than   the   provinces.
Municipalities can raise property  tax  and  turnover  or  payroll  regional
levies  on  businesses  as  well  as  user  charges  on  the  provision   of
electricity and water.

Municipalities collect  their  revenue  directly  through  their  collection
agencies. However, local governments generally do not collect a  significant
portion of revenue due, resulting in deficits at the end  of  the  financial
year.  No  additional  taxes  are  at  present  being  planned   for   local
government. The focus is on reforming the current design of local taxes  and
modernising collection and the billing system. The budgeting system is  also
being modernised and will be based on more realistic revenue projections.

In conclusion then, Chairperson, one would say that as  much  as  Government
is expected  to  take  into  consideration  the  FFC  recommendations,  when
dealing with the division of revenue, it will not be possible  for  National
Treasury to take all of the  recommendations  on  board.  However,  one  can
start to recognise the narrowing of the gap between the two. [Applause].
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L MUSHWANA):  Order!  I  take  this
opportunity to welcome the hon the Deputy Minister  and  call  upon  him  to
address the House.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon  members,  mine  really  is
not to address the House more than to acknowledge the debate that has  taken
place this afternoon and to indicate that at the National Treasury, we  will
gladly receive the report of the select  committee  based  on  the  hearings
held on the recommendations of the FFC.

As  the  hon  members  know,  we  normally  give  formal  responses  to  the
recommendations of the FFC. We will do so in due course because there  is  a
process that we also follow in dealing with the recommendations of the  FFC.
Unfortunately, we are not able to respond in  this  forum,  this  afternoon.
But perhaps there are a few points that one  would  like  to  make  just  in
relation to some of the points members  raised  during  the  course  of  the
debate. I think it is  important  to  mention  that  indeed,  the  issue  of
reviving  the  municipal  debt  market,  ensuring  that  we  can  create  an
environment in which municipalities are able in  their  own  right  to  have
access to the capital markets is very much part of the process that  we  are
engaged in right now, of passing through Parliament the  envisaged  Bill  on
the municipal finance management, but also in seeking  to  create  a  viable
framework to deal with financial emergencies in municipalities.

It is important to mention that  part  of  our  objective  is  not  just  to
improve financial management but  also  to  enhance  the  ability  of  local
government to access the capital market. In doing so, it is  important  that
we are able to provide certainty even to the creditors so that  it  is  much
easier and they  can  be  more  confident  to  enter  into  those  kinds  of
arrangements with local authorities.

Of course, in doing  this,  particularly  in  seeking  to  create  a  viable
framework to deal with  financial  emergencies,  we  have  to  look  at  our
Constitution. I think the important issue of the  municipal  debt  situation
and ensuring that municipalities can in their own right access  the  capital
markets  is  not  only  that  it  raises  additional   capital   for   local
authorities, it will help to enhance fiscal responsibility on  the  part  of
local authorities. Because progressively, we will have to  reverse  the  era
of bail - outs where  Government  entities  managed  their  affairs  in  the
belief and understanding that, should they run into trouble,  they  will  be
bailed out.

Fiscal responsibility is one issue which I think all of  us  would  like  to
promote. I think the chair of the finance committee in the Gauteng  province
made an important point about  finding  a  balance  between  creativity  and
being realistic in terms of what is possible.

Finally, about the point raised by the last speaker, it  is  important  that
we  continue  to  focus  on  the  importance  of  building   certain   basic
capabilities  within  local  authorities.  And  so  the  ability  of   local
authorities to deliver basic services, to do  proper  billing  for  services
provided and the ability to collect revenues  that  are  due  to  the  local
authority, I  think  these  are  things  that  should  really  constitute  a
critical focus in what we seek to achieve within local government.

But, I would like thank hon members for their participation in  the  debate.
And as I have said, we will gladly receive  the  report  of  the  committee.
[Applause.]

              FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND INTERMEDIARY SERVICES BILL

      (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee thereon)
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and hon  Members,  I  forgot  to
say earlier that today is the first time that I enter this hallowed  Chamber
since the revamping and I must say, it looks good. I  think  there  is  more
friendship in this House as a result  of  this  new  arrangement.  Everybody
must be feeling like hugging each other. [Applause.]

In South Africa there has been no  formal  system  of  regulating  financial
advisors and intermediaries. This implies that there has  been  no  recourse
for consumers who have been sold financial products  that  are  either  ill-
suited to their needs or that do not deliver the promised returns.

The Policy Board for Financial Services and Regulation in 1996 accepted  the
task of conceptualising and designing appropriate legislation to cover  this
regulatory deficiency. After  several  meetings  and  workshops  the  Policy
Board in December 1998 produced a basic framework for this law.

The Financial Services Board  was  mandated  to  draft  legislation  and  to
conduct   the   necessary   consultation   process.   Following    extensive
consultations, the range of financial products that were to  be  defined  in
the Bill was expanded significantly to cover  most  financial  products  and
instruments, including bank deposits. A major revision of the ambit  of  the
Bill occurred when intermediary services were made subject to the  terms  of
the Bill, in addition to the furnishing of  advice,  thereby  bringing  into
the regulatory net  virtually  all  the  activities  of  the  entire  broker
fraternity in the long-term and  the  short-term  insurance  industries,  as
well as those of portfolio or fund managers.

What is important to understand is that the Bill has a  functional  and  not
an institutional approach. It regulates a  function,  not  a  person  or  an
institution directly. Therefore, if a person performs a function  of  advice
or intermediary service, that person will have  to  be  licensed  under  the
Bill irrespective of whether that person  is  a  product  supplier  who  may
already be licensed under some other law or an intermediary or broker or  an
investment manager. In each instance, the  advice  or  intermediary  service
must relate to a financial product that embraces almost every investment  or
insurance product or financial instrument in the marketplace.

Effective regulation is to be  achieved  through  a  number  of  mechanisms.
Firstly, a financial services provider must be  licensed  in  terms  of  the
Bill and will have  to  comply  with  certain  prescribed,  fit  and  proper
criteria relating to honesty,  integrity,  competency,  operational  ability
and financial soundness.  A  licence  may  be  granted  subject  to  certain
conditions   and   restrictions,   which   creates   the   opportunity   for
differentiation or categorisation of providers in accordance with  the  type
and level of service rendered.  Unreasonable  entry  barriers  may  thus  be
obviated.

Secondly, the Bill imposes responsibilities on financial services  providers
with regard  to  their  representatives  for  whose  conduct  the  financial
services  provider  is  liable.  A  representative  engages  in   the   same
activities as its principal but does so for or on behalf  of  the  financial
services provider, either because he or she is an employee  of  or  holds  a
mandate from the provider. Representatives also need to  meet  the  criteria
relating to honesty and competency.

What this means is that an insurance company cannot just walk away  from  an
irregularity that has occurred on the basis that such irregularity was  done
by a representative, because such a representative  is  either  employed  by
the company or has a mandate from the company.  It  is  therefore  important
for such companies to ensure a certain level of standards  on  the  part  of
those that market its products on its behalf.

In order to establish a professional group of financial  services  providers
in South Africa, the Bill lays down standards  for  the  market  conduct  of
both providers and representatives. The focus is the needs of the  consumer,
the right of the consumer to be  treated  fairly,  full  disclosure  of  any
relevant matter and the  responsibility  of  the  industry  players  to  act
professionally and to place the interest of the consumer above their own.

A system of compliance is created in order to monitor adherence to  the  law
through the appointment of  compliance  officers,  through  record  keeping,
proper accounting and, where appropriate, auditing  requirements.  Due  care
has been  taken  to  ensure  effective  law  enforcement  in  the  event  of
transgressions by financial services providers or representatives.

Consumer complaints will be dealt with through  a  formal,  yet  expeditious
and cost-effective dispute resolution mechanism in the form  of  the  office
of the Ombud for Financial Services Providers. The design of the  office  is
to meet the constitutional requirements of independence and impartiality.  A
determination by the Ombud will have the effect  of  a  civil  judgment  and
will be executable through  the  ordinary  judicial  process.  In  addition,
civil remedies are available to the Registrar,  such  as  class  actions  on
behalf of deprived clients. The  Registrar,  who  is  empowered  to  declare
certain practices as undesirable, may impose administrative penalties.

Finally, criminal sanctioning is provided for through heavy fines and  terms
of imprisonment. Like other Acts  administered  by  the  Financial  Services
Board, the Bill creates a Registrar, being  the  executive  officer  of  the
Financial Services Board. There will also  be  an  advisory  committee  with
whom  the  Registrar  must  consult  on  important  issues   affecting   the
implementation of the Bill.

An outstanding feature of the Bill is its flexibility of  application.  This
will enable the regulator to rectify  unintended  consequences,  to  address
cases of hardship and to ensure pragmatism in the application of the Act.

In conclusion, I am happy to state that the controversy  over  the  position
of the health brokers, that  is  whether  their  market  conduct  should  be
regulated under this Bill, rather than under the Medical  Schemes  Act,  has
been sensibly resolved. The essential element of the agreement concluded  is
that intermediaries in the  medical  schemes  environment,  that  is  health
brokers, will like  all  other  intermediaries  be  subject  to  the  common
framework  provided  by  this  Bill,  thereby  establishing  an   integrated
approach to market conduct regulation.

The Bill before  the  Council  today  is  the  final  product  of  intensive
deliberations during the consultative process. All major  industry  players,
consumer  organisations,  governmental  institutions  and  regulators   have
expressed support for the Bill. It is proposed that a sound  case  has  been
made for the adoption of the Bill in the interest of consumer protection.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I think  what  is  worth  noting  is  that  Dr
Conroy and Mr Theron are wearing the ties from the  finance  team  which  we
obtained from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. That is what I  am  declaring
on their behalf.

The relevance  of  the  Bill  seeking  approval  from  this  House  is  very
important not only to give certainties to investors, but to  consumers  like
hon members and me. The Bill seeks to regulate  the  business  of  rendering
financial services to clients on a range  of  products  such  as  financial,
health-care and insurance products and also any advice given by  brokers  to
consumers and investors.

People who want to provide such services  according  to  the  Bill  must  be
licensed and their conduct shall be governed by  the  code  of  conduct  and
enforcement measures contained in the Financial  Advisory  and  Intermediary
Services legislation and in the regulations that are to  be  promulgated  at
the later stage by the Minister.

The Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Bill will  work  in  tandem
with  the  Medical  Schemes  Amendment  Bill  -  amendments  to  the  latter
legislation are before the Portfolio Committee on  Health  in  the  National
Assembly.  The  Fais  legislation  and  amendments  to  the  medical-schemes
legislation provide for a single gateway for  health  brokers  in  achieving
the broader health objective in this context.
An amendment to the medical-scheme legislation seeks  to  bring  the  health
brokers into the Fais regime. What is important is that  accreditation  will
still be done by the Council  for  Medical  Schemes  in  so  far  as  health
products are concerned. The FSB  will  not  take  responsibility  of  giving
accreditation through the Fais regime  because  the  health  authorities  or
regulators will take responsibility for that.

Having said the above, I would just like  to  raise  three  issues  in  this
regard. The first issues was raised in the Business Day on 3 September  this
year and in Finance Week on 13 September. They have  raised  several  issues
and I will deal with those issues in  that  order,  not  because  the  media
raised them, but the committee also picked it up when we  were  getting  the
briefing and I will delve into that.

What the legislation is seeking to achieve is to strike the balance  between
keeping the cost low and protect the  investors  or  consumers  as  much  as
possible. The important thing is that proper practice should be  adhered  to
by big, medium and small brokers. I do not  think  we  are  advocating  that
small  brokers,  because  they  are  small  should  not  adhere  to   proper
standards.

Generally South  Africa  has  been  hailed  by  the  international  monetary
institutions  as  having  the  best  financial  system.  So   through   this
legislation we want to make sure that even small brokers, if  they  want  to
participate in this industry, have to make sure that  they  adhere  to  this
principle. I think that element is quite important.  The  notion  that  says
when small brokers who happen to be black, come into this thing,  they  have
to break the law and do not have to adhere to proper  principle,  should  be
dispelled in the best possible way.

The Business Day article, as I said earlier, said on 3  September  that  the
Bill could hurt small financial advisors. The article reads as follows:


  At the moment there are about 30 000 intermediaries, financial advisories
  and brokers working in South Africa's financial services sector,  selling
  products from life insurance to other policies.

The article also talks about the possible high  cost  to  medium  and  small
companies, saying:


  We will have to spend a minimum of R200 000 more a year in order to  meet
  the requirements as stipulated in the Financial Advisory and Intermediary
  Services Bill.

The point I was raising earlier on is that as much as this may be  true  and
as much as there will be high costs, some of these costs are necessary  when
people's systems are first put in place. But as time goes on some  of  these
costs will go down  and  I  think  in  our  discussion  with  the  Financial
Services Board yesterday, they assured us that care has been taken  to  make
sure that the small brokers are not driven out of the market as a result  of
these bad practices the country is adopting.

Another article in the Finance Week from the 13 September refers to  it  and
makes a point that in the UK, when such  legislation  was  introduced,  many
small brokers were driven out of the market. As I  said,  we  do  not  think
that this legislation is going to do away with small brokers. Instead  small
brokers should find it a challenge to  make  sure  that  they  come  to  the
party. But if people cannot come to the party as  individuals,  they  should
find a mechanism of working together, because  when  people  work  as  small
companies all over the show, sometimes it defeats the purpose  of  why  they
are there in the first place.  I  think  people  should  try  to  find  some
creativity in making sure  that  they  live  up  to  the  desired  principle
contained in the legislation.

Having raised the issues that concern the medium and small companies, it  is
important that we as a committee report to this House that we will  continue
to seek better means and mechanisms of engaging the  small  business  sector
in all the sectors that  we  are  overseeing  as  the  Select  Committee  on
Finance. We have noted, as a committee, that in our  sector  because  it  is
very technical and in many instances  people  who  are  like  us,  from  the
previously disadvantaged communities, do not have skills and capacity to  be
able to do this kind of thing.

Therefore, I think it is important for  all  of  us,  including  Members  of
Parliament who are sitting in this Chamber, to try and  assist  as  much  as
possible in educating people about legislation and about  any  other  matter
we can to assist the small business in particular, even going to the  extent
of finding mechanisms. How do we get them to Parliament or how do we  go  to
their places where they are, so that they can be able  to  make  input  into
these policy-making processes?

One of the mechanisms that is built into the legislation in  an  attempt  to
the small brokers is that there is  an  Advisory  Committee  which  is  very
comprehensive in terms of representativity. I think small  brokers  in  this
instance will be  accommodated  if  they  are  not  fairly  treated  in  the
industry in general. That committee, which will be  seeking  to  advise  the
Minister from time to time, is going to be established for, amongst  others,
such purposes. Again, there is also an exemption  clause  contained  in  the
legislation which is also making  sure  that  if  these  small  brokers  are
unable to come to the party, as I said earlier on,  there  will  be  special
exemption given for them to be able to come to the party,  not  as  inferior
people  but  taking  into  account  the  conditions  in  which   they   find
themselves.

There is a policy-holder protection rule  which  the  legislation  seeks  to
talk about. What I need to emphasise is  that  big  business  has  been  and
remains opposed to this policy-holder protection.  They  want  this  policy-
holder rules to be phased out immediately when this legislation  comes  into
effect. The committee supports  National  Treasury's  approach,  which  says
that the policy-holder protection rules provision will be  phased  out  only
when the Fais regime has come into full effect, because if it is phased  out
immediately it is going to help or defeat the purpose  of  why  the  policy-
holder protection rules were there in the first place and  that  may  expose
in particular the small brokers, therefore they will be more hurt.
The benefit to consumers will arise from reduced misselling and  overselling
of financial products through the core element of  improved  disclosure.  In
the past, when a person  came  and  sold  someone  a  financial  product  or
anything else, brokers did not tell us how much  their  commission  was  and
that type of thing. But this policy-protection holder  rule  seeks  to  make
sure that people must declare and disclose upfront what it is  that  one  is
buying and the kind of product one is buying from them.

I am told that my time is up. One last point that  I  want  to  indicate  is
that in Botswana there is a very stringent regulatory  mechanism,  which  is
stricter than in South Africa. I think it is  important  to  compare  apples
with apples,  because  Botswana  is  a  developing  country  like  ours  and
therefore we can learn a lot  from  them.  But  their  conditions  are  more
stringent.  I  want  to  thank  members  of  the  committee  and  the   FSB.
[Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Mnr die Voorsitter,  agb  Adjunk-Minister  van  Finansies  en
kollegas,  'n  mens  kan  deesdae  skaars  die  verbruikerskolomme  in   die
dagblaaie oopslaan, of daar  is  die  een  of  ander  klagte  of  berig  van
individue of groepe wat ingeloop is deur 'n, sê  maar  ``slim'',  ondernemer
wat hom- of haarself 'n finansiële raadgewer noem. Dit  is  veral  oues  van
dae  en  pensioenarisse  wat  deur  gewetenlose  bedrieërs  van  hul  karige
spaargeld beroof word. Die berugte Masterbonddebakel  lê  nog  vars  in  die
geheue en dit is nie verbasend dat die bedryf, ten  regte  of  ten  onregte,
onder 'n wolk van verdenking van oneerlikheid, vals raad,  swak  verwagtings
en bedenklike produkte opereer  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Dr E  A  CONROY:  Mr  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister  of  Finance  and
colleagues, these days one can hardly turn to  the  consumer  pages  in  the
daily newspapers without encountering one  or  other  complaint  or  article
about individuals or groups that have  been  taken  in  by  a,  let  us  say
``clever'', entrepreneur who  refers  to  him  or  herself  as  a  financial
advisor. It is particularly the elderly and pensioners  who  are  robbed  of
their meagre savings by unscrupulous  swindlers.  The  notorious  Masterbond
debacle is still fresh in our memories and it is  not  surprising  that  the
industry, rightly or  wrongly,  operates  under  a  cloud  of  suspicion  of
dishonesty, false advice, poor expectations and dubious products.]

It is, however, not only the elderly who fall victim to the traps  of  these
so-called financial experts or consultants. Believe  it  or  not,  even  the
younger generation, who consider themselves  to  be  very  streetwise,  fall
prey to unscrupulous financial advisors.

Had I stopped my address here, one would have believed  that  all  financial
advisors and investment consultants can be classified  in  the  category  of
being less than honest. That is not the case, however, as  the  majority  of
the South African financial advisers are honest men and women who  render  a
necessary and indispensable service to the financial industry.

However, if we accept that they are honest people  of  high  integrity,  the
question can still be asked whether all of them are  qualified  to  do  what
they are doing. Or, do they  have  any  financial  backing  to  correct  any
honest but unfortunate mistakes that they might make in the  handling  of  a
client's financial affairs and which could ultimately lead to the  financial
ruin of that client?

Ons is almal bewus van die uiters belangrike rol wat die  finansiële  sektor
in die huidige en toekomstige ekonomiese groei van ons land  speel.  Dit  is
daarom nie vreemd dat die skepping van een of ander vorm van beheer oor  die
bedryf dwingend noodsaaklik geword het nie.

Verbruikersbeskerming is dan ook die grondslag van  hierdie  Wetsontwerp  op
Finansiële Advies-  en  Tussengangerdienste.  Dit  reguleer  'n  bedryf  wat
dienste ten opsigte van 'n wye reeks finansiële  produkte  aan  die  publiek
lewer. Hierdie wetsontwerp sal toesien  dat  die  persone  wat  dié  dienste
lewer, gelisensieer is en dat hul professionele  optrede  beheer  word  deur
die toepassing van maatreëls wat  toesien  dat  die  gedragskodes  eerbiedig
word.

Die beoogde wet sal vereis en toesien  dat  'n  finansiële  diensverskaffer,
naamlik 'n instansie wat die besigheid van finansiële adviesbediening  en/of
die lewering van intermediêre dienste  bedryf,  aan  die  volgende  kriteria
voldoen voordat 'n lisensie toegeken word, naamlik,  dat  die  aansoeker  se
eerlikheid en integriteit bo verdenking is, dat hy of sy bekwaam is  en  oor
die operasionele vermoë beskik en ook finansieel  gesond  is.  Die  lisensie
mag onderhewig aan sekere voorwaardes en beperkings toegeken word, dit  hoef
nie hernieu te word nie, maar mag wel opgeskort of ingetrek word.

Die voorgenome  wet  sal  deur  'n  registrateur  in  die  persoon  van  die
hoofuitvoerende beampte  van  die  Raad  op  Finansiële  Dienste,  die  RFD,
geadministreer word. Daar word beraam dat die personeel  van  die  raad  met
ongeveer 15 persone uitgebrei sal moet word. Tydens die voorligting oor  die
wetsontwerp aan die Gekose Komitee oor Finansies het die  adjunk-uitvoerende
hoof van die raad trouens die onderneming gegee dat hierdie groot  taak  wat
op die RFD wag wél deur hulle hanteer sal word -  voorwaar  'n  verfrissende
briesie in hierdie tye waarin 'n personeeltekort  so  maklik  as  verskoning
gebruik word wanneer 'n instansie jammerlik faal om die  taak  wat  aan  hom
toevertrou is na behore uit te voer.

Daar is oor 'n tydperk van twee jaar wyd oor die  onderwerp  van  vandag  se
debat  gekonsulteer  en  'n  groot  hoeveelheid  geskrewe,  elektroniese  en
mondelinge  insette  is  deur  die  RFD  oor  feitlik  elke  faset  van  die
wetsontwerp ontvang, terwyl daar  van  radio-  en  televisieprogramme  asook
openbare werksessies gebruik  gemaak  is  om  alle  belanghebbendes  by  die
proses te betrek.

Die wetsontwerp het geen finansiële implikasies vir die staat nie.  Voorsorg
is ook tydens die opstellingsproses getref om  te  verseker  dat  daar  geen
gronde  vir  bewerings  van  ongrondwetlikheid   sal   wees   nie.   Hierdie
wetsontwerp voldoen aan 'n langgevoelde behoefte en word deur  die  Nuwe  NP
gesteun. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We are all aware of the very  important  role  that  the  financial  sector
plays in the current and future  economic  growth  of  our  country.  It  is
therefore not strange that the creation of one  or  other  form  of  control
over the industry has become vitally essential.

Accordingly, consumer protection is the basis  of  this  Financial  Advisory
and Intermediary Services Bill. This  regulates  an  industry  that  renders
services with regard to a wide range of financial products  to  the  public.
This Bill will see to it that the persons who  provide  these  services  are
licensed and that their  professional  conduct  is  controlled  by  applying
measures that ensure that the codes of conduct are adhered to.

The  envisaged  Act  will  demand  and  ensure  that  a  financial  services
provider, namely an institution  that  manages  the  business  of  financial
advisory services and/or the delivery of intermediary services,  adheres  to
the following  criteria  before  a  licence  is  granted,  namely  that  the
applicant's honesty and integrity are above suspicion, that  he  or  she  is
competent and has the operational abilities and  that  he  or  she  is  also
financially sound. The licence may be awarded subject to certain  conditions
and limitations; it does not have to be renewed, but may well  be  suspended
or revoked.

The envisaged Act will be administered by a registrar in the person  of  the
chief executive officer of the Financial Services  Board,  the  FSB.  It  is
estimated that  the  staff  of  the  board  will  have  to  be  extended  by
approximately 15 persons. During the presentation on the Bill to the  Select
Committee on Finance the deputy chief executive of the Board  in  fact  gave
the undertaking that this immense task that awaits the FSB would  indeed  be
handled by them - truly a breath of fresh air in  these  times  in  which  a
staff shortage can so easily be used as an excuse when an institution  fails
dismally to properly execute the task entrusted to it.

Over a period of  two  years  widespread  consultation  took  place  on  the
subject of today's debate and a great  many  written,  electronic  and  oral
inputs were received by the FSB on practically  every  facet  of  the  Bill,
while radio and television programmes, as well  as  public  workshops,  were
also used to involve all stakeholders in the process.

The Bill has no financial implications for the State. Precautions were  also
taken during the drafting process to ensure that there will  be  no  grounds
for allegations of unconstitutionality. This Bill  meets  a  long-felt  need
and is supported by the New NP. [Applause.]]

Mr J L THERON: Mr  Chairperson,  the  Financial  Advisory  and  Intermediary
Services Bill aims to regulate the rendering of certain  financial  advisory
and intermediary services  to  clients.  The  Bill  sets  up  a  process  of
authorisation and/or accreditation for financial  service  providers  across
all sectors, for example the banking of certain  deposits,  long-and  short-
term  insurance.  Accreditation  is  granted  by  the  registrar,  executive
officer of the Financial Services Board, the FSB.
In accordance with an agreement between the Ministries  of  Finance  and  of
Health, financial service  providers  for  medical  schemes  in  the  health
sector will be accredited by virtue of  a  consequential  amendment  to  the
Medical Schemes Act, Act No 131  of  1998.  The  Bill  further  sets  up  an
advisory committee,  comprising  all  financial  service  provider  industry
players, to advise and interact with the registrar.

In order to ensure agreement with the new regulatory  regime  for  financial
services and the  consumer  protection  it  seeks  to  establish,  the  Bill
creates a new Financial Services Ombud which  has  overlapping  jurisdiction
with the  courts  and  other  relevant  sectoral  regulators  such  as,  for
example, the Banking Adjudicator.

Globally, we are witnessing an increase  in  the  activities  of  regulatory
structures and regulation of industries  and  bodies  that  formerly  prided
themselves on the  principles  of  self-regulation.  Cases  such  as  Arthur
Anderson and Merrill Lynch are recent examples that have led  to  a  growing
debate on corporate governance and regulation in the  interest  of  consumer
and shareholder protection.

Globally, the financial services industry is regulated with a  great  degree
of  sector-specificity.  While  this  Bill  takes  the  first  step  towards
regulation  in  the  interest  of  consumers,  Parliament,  and  indeed  the
Advisory Committee, set up in accordance  with  the  Bill,  which  comprises
industry players, must not only keep  a  watchful  eye  on  the  regulations
issued after the passage of this Bill but also over their implementation.

While a lot of regulatory discretion is inherent in the Bill,  it  would  be
difficult to argue  that  it  is  sufficient  ground  to  oppose  the  Bill.
Similarly, while it is true that in this Bill the executive officer  of  the
FSB has wide-ranging  powers  over  the  financial  services  industry,  the
arguments regarding consumer protection are convincing.  In  addition,  most
industry players are broadly supportive of this Bill and  wide  consultation
has taken place.

It is recommended that the DP and DA support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, may we congratulate the Minister and the FSP  on
this measure. The experience worldwide has been that  financial  advice  and
intermediary services have often been unreliable. Consistently good,  sound,
honest, objective and skilful financial advice is very hard to get, indeed.

Furthermore, it is true that a national savings ethos must be occupying  the
Minister's mind and it is vital for any country in order  to  find,  develop
and grow a pool of capital to make growth and  investment  possible  and  to
raise standards of living. South Africa is  currently  experiencing  a  very
low savings rate, which holds out no good for  our  financial  health  as  a
nation.

Historically, the insurance industry was the main vehicle  to  mobilise  the
savings of ordinary people and it remains important.  But  it  is  only  one
avenue, and not always the best one.
There  are,  of  course,  many  factors  that  persuade  people   to   delay
consumption and thereby to save and  accumulate  wealth.  Amongst  the  most
important is confidence - faith in one's currency and its  value  and  faith
in one's country. That is why on the US currency is  written:  ``In  God  we
trust''. In that  way,  they  elevate  that  faith.  Inflation  is  a  major
disincentive to saving and that must be worrying us all.

One has to have confidence in one's institutions and advisors and they  need
to be worthy of  that  faith.  One  also  has  to  have  confidence  in  the
regulations and the law and the regulators governing those bodies. This,  of
course, is a classic role for  the  state:  to  so  regulate  the  financial
environment that the ordinary  person  can  expect  and  indeed  obtain  the
necessary objective advice and guidance and thus have confidence  to  invest
and grow his funds on his own and in the national interest.

There have been too many failures here and worldwide for the state to  stand
back and allow a lax attitude to prevail. We are fortunate  to  have  strong
institutions and a lot of good practice to build on in  order  to  establish
the best practice which, indeed, this Bill seeks to  achieve  along  with  a
family of other legislation.

We have been world leaders in this field. We have been world leaders in  the
insurance industry, unit - trust industry and demutualisation. A lot of  our
legislation is and has always been ahead of the world.  Now,  I  think  with
this legislation we are in step with the best practice worldwide.

The Bill builds upon the best in our system and elsewhere  and  there  is  a
product of consultation here and worldwide. The  FSB  seeks  to  retain  and
build our national position as a well-regulated  regional  financial  centre
co-operating with the world. We must be ambitious for our country. If  Nepad
and other efforts are to succeed, we will need to have  a  viable  financial
centre, and that we cannot do without mobilising savings. This Bill is user-
friendly and relies very much on affordable self-regulation.
This Bill is not without teeth. There are enforcement measures which we  can
also mobilise in other  legislation.  The  Bill  is  pre-eminently  consumer
legislation and one hopes that  consumer  courts  will  gain  the  teeth  to
protect particularly the small  investor  that  needs  to  become  far  more
savings orientated. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister of Finance,  Comrade  Mandisi
Mpahlwa, chairperson and members of the committee, ladies and  gentlemen,  I
want to deal with the key principles in relation to the  Financial  Advisory
and Intermediary Services Bill and not deal  -  quite  deliberately  -  with
other issues that have been dealt with quite  sufficiently  by  hon  members
here.

The Bill before the House this afternoon, as other hon  members  have  said,
regulates the  business  of  rendering  financial  services  to  clients  as
regards a large range of financial products. This legislation, in  terms  of
what I mentioned earlier on, is based on three key principles, one  of  them
being that it was accepted that it would not be in the  public  interest  if
the  authorisation  and  compliance  requirements  were   too   strict   and
burdensome  for  the  authorised  financial  services  providers  and  their
representatives in the industry. Consequently provision in respect  of  this
legislation is,  firstly,  made  for  the  consultation  with  the  advisory
committee on financial services providers in the making  of  regulations  on
the requirement for authorisation. The point was also made by the hon  chair
of the committee in respect of the  provision  in  the  legislation  on  the
granting of appropriate exemptions for industry  players,  which  I  am  not
going to say anything about, because it was mentioned.

The second principle, in terms of the Bill, was to ensure that this kind  of
legislation  is  designed  to  be  free-standing  and  complete  as  far  as
possible. Reference, therefore, is made  in  the  Bill  to  a  proposed  new
Collective Investment Schemes Control  Bill,  which  is  before  the  select
committee and was deliberated  quite  exhaustively  yesterday  as  well  and
deals comprehensively with investment  schemes  where  pooling  of  client's
funds basically occurs. It is one of the issues to which reference  is  made
in this legislation.

The last  one  is  that  a  deliberate  attempt  is  made  again  to  create
regulatory flexibility by providing for circumscribed  discretionary  power.
But one issue which I felt I needed to dwell on a bit relates to the  matter
in relation to section 65  of  the  Medical  Schemes  Act,  which  has  been
amicably resolved, as was pointed  out  by  the  hon  Deputy  Minister.  The
difficulties concerning the position of the health brokers have indeed  been
resolved adequately to the satisfaction of all parties.

In the gazetted version of the Bill, provision was therefore  made  for  the
exemption of health brokers who are accredited in terms  of  the  section  I
referred to earlier on, which is section 65 of the Medical  Schemes  Act  of
1998. This proposed  exemption  was  met  with  severe  criticism  from  all
commentators, particularly in the long- and  short-term  insurance  industry
and consumer bodies. Having reconsidered the matter  and  arguments  against
the exemption of health brokers, the FSB, prior to the  submission  of  this
Bill to the committees on  finance,  effected  an  amendment  that  had  the
result of including health brokers within the ambit of the Bill.

The Council for Medical  Schemes  rejected  this  reversal  on  the  earlier
position, seeing  it  as  an  intrusion  into  their  regulatory  territory.
Representations on behalf of the  Council  for  Medical  Schemes  were  also
submitted to both the Portfolio and the  Select  Committees  on  Finance  in
Parliament, supported by motivations from the Health Ministry.

After a delay of some months, the  impasse  was  resolved  by  means  on  an
agreement between the Financial Services Board and the Council  for  Medical
Schemes.  Legislative  effect  to  that  agreement  was  given  through  the
introduction of a new clause 8, subsection 7, in the Financial Advisory  and
Intermediary Services Bill.

The essential element of the  agreement  concluded  is  that  whilst  health
brokers will have to be accredited  under  the  Medical  Schemes  Act,  they
will, like all other intermediaries, be  subject  to  the  common  framework
provided by the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services  Bill,  thereby
establishing an integrated approach to market regulation.  The  difficulties
experienced by health brokers were  subsequently  resolved  in  an  amicable
manner.

The amended Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Bill  presented  to
our  Select  Committee  on  Finance  is  the  final  product  of   intensive
deliberations during the consultative  processes  and  during  parliamentary
debates and discussions.

Support for this Bill has been expressed  by  all  major  industry  players,
consumer  organisations,  government   institutions   and   regulators.   No
contentious issues, as things stand now, remain unresolved.

It is submitted that a sound case has therefore been made for  the  adoption
of this Bill as amended in the main, which is in the  interest  of  consumer
protection. It is therefore our well-considered view  that  as  the  ANC  we
endorse this progressive piece of legislation, because we  believe  that  it
is not only desirable but has become an absolute necessity. If  I  make  the
point again, that this legislation ... [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Mr Chairperson  and  hon  members,  I  would
like to thank the members and all the parties  for  their  support  of  this
particular Bill.

I would like to say that the issue around, for example,  the  small  brokers
is a matter that we regard as an  important  one.  There  are  flexibilities
which have been built into the legislation so that,  if  there  were  to  be
unintended consequences, we would be able  to  deal  with  those  unintended
consequences within  the  context  of  the  legislation.  For  example,  the
registrar does have leeway to exempt particular applicants from sections  of
the Bill that may cause financial or other hardships. So in a way, I  think,
that would provide that possibility should it become evident that there  may
be such an unintended consequence.

However, I think it is important to say that  what  we  seek  to  do  is  to
establish a very sound  environment  in  the  financial  services  provision
industry in the interest of the consumer so  that,  whether  one  is  small,
medium or big, one must provide a certain basic level  of  service  that  is
credible to the consumer. We must not lose sight of that  fact,  because  of
the smallness of the people. But it does not mean that we  are  not  willing
to engage should it become clear  that  there  may  be  such  an  unintended
consequence, that the Bill may drive out small brokers from the industry.  I
also think that there is an advisory committee  that  has  been  established
which can render advice on any matter that impacts on the financial  service
provision industry.

On the issue of health brokers, I think it is important, in relation to  the
point the hon Taabe raised, to see the agreement which was  reached  as  not
just an agreement between the two  regulators.  Between  the  Department  of
Finance or the National Treasury and the Department  of  Health  we  had  to
agree on broad parameters, the one being that we need to establish a  common
framework to regulate all brokers. The reason for that is that some  of  the
brokers, typically the small brokers, do  not  specialise  in  one  product,
because for their survival  it  is  important  to  sell  a  whole  range  of
products. So, they will sell an insurance product, a health product  and  so
on.

So how is  one  going  to  say  in  respect  of  a  particular  product  one
individual will be regulated by Fais and in respect of a health product  the
same individual will be regulated by another piece of  legislation?  We  had
to establish that all brokers had to be  regulated  in  terms  of  a  common
framework and then, having agreed on that, let us also find ways  to  ensure
that the Department of Health is able to impact on  the  conduct  of  health
brokers to the extent that that is important for the  attainment  of  health
policy objectives. So those are the two broad parameters that we agreed  on.
We then asked the regulators to go and work out at  a  technical  level  how
best we can achieve that. I must say that the  outcome  has  really  been  a
very good one for everybody, because it meets the needs  and  the  interests
of everybody.

The point to endorse is that it is these kinds of things, such as  the  Fais
legislation,  that  will  indeed  give  people   the   confidence   in   our
institutions, in our system, to encourage them to save,  for  example.  Just
last week was a savings week  and  it  is  quite  appropriate  that  we  are
discussing this at this point in time.

Again, the point about inflation is  an  important  one  and,  I  think,  it
really helps to keep our focus on the issue of  keeping  inflation  low.  It
reinforces the point about having an inflation target. I know  that  in  the
current environment, where we are having inflationary problems arising  from
the depreciation of the currency last year, people tend to suggest  that  it
is wrong for us to have an inflation target, it is wrong for us to  try  and
contain inflation at a low level. I think that view  is  incorrect  because,
when one targets inflation, one is protecting the  incomes  of  particularly
poor  people,  because  people  with  high  incomes  have  some  degree   of
flexibility, but it is very difficult for people who have low incomes.

Again, this will really contribute to  maintaining  the  excellence  of  our
institutions. I thank everybody. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.
