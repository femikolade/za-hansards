                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr J H NASH: Madam Speaker, on the next sitting day of the House I shall
move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that thousands of pupils from Langa, Cape Town, marched
       demanding safety in schools and raised their plight on school
       vandalism prevalent in the area;


  (2) further notes that this march was organised by the Langa Safer School
       Cluster and supported by the Congress of South African Students and
       the South African Democratic Teachers' Union;


  (3) echoes the calls by the pupils to make places of learning safe; and


  (4) calls on the community of Langa to work with police to ensure that
       learning materials and schools are safe.
[Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice on behalf of the DP that
I shall move on the next sitting day of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns the scavenger politics being indulged in by representatives
       of the ANC and the New NP;
  (2) places on record that it accepts the word of Tony Leon above the word
       of someone like Jurgen Harksen, and notes that unlike President
       Mbeki's evasions when it comes to his dealings with Mr Vito
       Palazzolo, Mr Leon has nothing to hide in respect of Mr Harksen or
       anyone else; and


  (3) regrets that the Premier of the Western Cape is being permitted to
       use taxpayers' money to pay off old political scores in the most
       disreputable fashion.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) regrets the treatment meted out by the principal and the school
       governing body to the teacher of Simon Primary School, KwaZulu-Natal,
       Miss Sibongile Mkhize, who faces dismissal because she revealed her
       HIV status;


  (2) further regrets that the action of the governing body and the
       principal flies in the face of human rights as nobody should be
       discriminated against because of his or her health status;


  (3) applauds this woman for coming out in order to destigmatise the
       disease even as she has stigmatised herself now; and


  (4) hopes that the Human Rights Commission, to which she has appealed,
       will rule in her favour and thus grant her emotional and
       psychological reprieve and dispel the perception that HIV/Aids
       renders a person a social pariah.
[Applause.]

Ms M M RAMAKABA-LESIEA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the Cape High Court sentenced a 42-year-old man to an
       effective 23 years for murdering and indecently assaulting an 11-year-
       old girl;


  (2) commends members of the SAPS investigation team for bringing this
       perpetrator to book; and


  (3) welcomes the sentences meted out against this criminal.
[Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the New NP I hereby give
notice that I shall move at the next sitting:


  That the House notes -


  (1) the outrageous and vicious statement by the Chief Whip of the DP, the
       hon Gibson, calling the Desai Commission a kangaroo court that is not
       impartial or competent and stating that Judge Desai is ``acting more
       like an ANC branch chairman than like an independent investigator'';
  (2) that the DP has always been the party condemning other parties and
       individuals who dare to criticise judicial commissions of judges;


  (3) that this unprecedented attack on a judge and judicial commission is
       a clear sign that the DP/DA has abandoned yet another core principle
       of liberalism, namely the respect for the judiciary, in favour of
       political expediency; and


  (4) that this slanderous personal attack on the judge diminishes the hon
       Gibson and his party, and serves as confirmation of the DP/DA's
       morally and politically corrupt modus operandi.
[Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the furore caused by the reported use of offensive and
           derogatory words in reference to South Africans of Asian descent
           in a song composed by well-known musician Mbongeni Ngema;


       (b)  that with the advent of our democratic Constitution we have
           progressed immensely on the road to nation-building; and


       (c)  that the reported unfortunate use of such words is divisive and
           negates the cause of nation-building;


  (2) condemns the use of the reported words;


  (3) calls on South Africans to reject all divisive forces and to
       relentlessly pursue the cause of patriotism and nation-building; and


  (4) calls on musician Ngema to withdraw the reported offensive song and
       to apologise to South Africans. Phansi ngoNgema! [Down with Ngema!]
[Applause.]
Mr J P CRONIN: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the unprecedented attack on Judge Siraj Desai by the Chief Whip
       of the DP, Mr Douglas Gibson, in which he attacked the integrity of a
       member of the judiciary, likening the Desai Commission to a kangaroo
       court;


  (2) believes that such an attack is inappropriate, unseemly and
       slanderous, and tarnishes the image of his party and this House; and


  (3) calls on the DP to respect the integrity of the judiciary, and for Mr
       Gibson to cease using such tactics to divert the attention of the
       electorate from some highly suspect activities of his party and its
       leadership.
[Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mev die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek by die
volgende sitting van die Huis namens die FF gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat 'n oorweldigende meerderheid, naamlik 90,8%,
       van die huidige studente aan die PU vir CHO hulle ten gunste van die
       behoud van die woord ``Christelik'' in die universiteit se naam
       uitgespreek het in 'n referendum wat pas gehou is;


  (2) die universiteit gelukwens met die proses wat gevolg is, waar
       studente in die saak geken is en hulle duidelik uitspraak gegee het;
       en


  (3) die hoop uitspreek dat die universiteit sal besef dat die groter
       gemeenskap van die universiteit, naamlik die studente, oud-studente
       en ouers, geken sal moet word in besluitnemingsprosesse wat die
       karakter van die universiteit raak en dat hy nie op sy eie hieroor
       kan besluit nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)
[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day I
shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note that an overwhelming majority, namely 90,8%, of the
       present students at the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher
       Education have expressed that they are in favour of retaining the
       word "Christian" in the name of the University at a referendum held
       recently;


  (2) congratulates the university with the process followed, where
       students were consulted on the matter and they could clearly give
       their opinion; and


  (3) expresses the hope that the university will realise that the larger
       community of the university, namely the students, ex-students and
       parents will have to be consulted with regards to the decision-making
       process which affects the character of the university and that the
       university cannot make autonomous decisions.]
Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at the next sitting I
shall move on behalf of the FA:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note that -


       (a)  the President has pardoned some farm murderers who claimed that
           the crimes were committed as part of the political struggle;


       (b)  the agricultural community was lead to believe by numerous
           investigations that farm murders were not politically motivated
           but were rather crime-related and done by common criminals;


       (c)  due to this contradiction, the implication exists that political
           parties in this House were directly or indirectly involved in
           the murders of farmers, their wives and farm workers; and


       (d)  the pardon of so-called farm murderers on political grounds
           implies that murdering people on farms was part of the political
           struggle by political parties present in this House; and


  (2) calls on political parties who support the pardon to clearly state
       where they were involved in murdering farmers and farm workers as
       part of the political struggle or not.
[Applause.]

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Western Cape government has increased its housing budget by
           about R130 million a year for the next three years; and


       (b)  the province will have R1,2 billion at its disposal over this
           period to help reduce the housing shortage;


  (2) believes that this demonstrates the commitment of the ANC/New NP-led
       Government to build a better life for all in the Western Cape through
       the provision of affordable housing; and


  (3) welcomes the budgetary allocations for housing in the Western Cape,
       as this will contribute positively in addressing the legacy of
       apartheid in the province.
[Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) recalls how the Munnik Commission of Inquiry was used by P W Botha as
       a witch-hunt to expose the financing of ANC activities;
  (2) notes the uncanny similarities between that exercise and the Desai
       Commission; and


  (3) therefore resolves to request the Chief Justice of South Africa to
       consider whether judges should continue accepting appointments as
       chairpersons of commissions of inquiry which are clearly politically
       motivated and which could be used for the purpose of paying off
       political scores, the result of which is to drag judges into
       political controversy and expose them to public criticism.
[Applause.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at the next sitting of
the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a recent study in the United States found that ``having women in
           the top management teams resulted in higher earnings and greater
           shareholder wealth''; and


       (b)  a study by the World Bank concluded that women contribute to
           good governance and that ``where the influence of women in
           public life is higher, the level of corruption is lower; and


  (2) should therefore strive to be gender sensitive and gender balanced,
       as the personal quality and integrity of woman leaders will make a
       difference in the lives of the citizenry.
[Applause.]

Mr M E GEORGE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Thabang Khumalo, who escaped from prison and killed a
       station commander in Soweto, was rearrested by police last night;


  (2) commends the investigating officers, the SAPS and all those who made
       it possible for this criminal to be rearrested;


  (3) calls on the justice system to impose an appropriate sentence on this
       cold-blooded killer; and


  (4) warns those who follow Thabang Khumalo that the law will deal with
       them harshly should they engage in these criminal actions.
[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move at the
next sitting:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the hon Mr Leon has decided to avoid the media and the public
           with regard to the Harksen revelations, indicating that he was
           part and parcel of the funding scandal;
       (b)  instead of facing the media and the public to clarify his
           actions, he decided to send in more junior colleagues to try to
           explain the unexplainable; and


       (c)  the hon Mr Leon is still in hiding and avoiding contact with the
           press and the public and therefore has not shed some light on
           his involvement and actions; and


  (2) calls on the DA to -


       (a)  instruct their leader to face the media and the public; and


       (b)  put the hon Mr Leon on leave until all the revelations have been
           fully investigated.
[Applause.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the UDM at
the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the contradictory statements by the Eastern Cape Health
       Department's permanent secretary and the Eastern Cape Health MEC,
       which creates confusion regarding whether or not the province's eight
       cash-strapped SA National Tuberculosis, Santa,  hospitals have
       received their subsidies;


  (2) further notes the importance of these hospitals, especially in a
       province that has experienced a TB crisis since the 1950s, and duly
       notes that these hospitals run at one-eighth of the cost to the state
       when compared to provincial hospitals;


  (3) expresses concern at the bureaucratic bungling by state officials,
       especially in the light of the fact that TB is the province's biggest
       killer; and


  (4) calls on the Minister of Health to intervene urgently and address
       this issue adequately, failing which the Health MEC should resign, as
       many people's lives depend on efficiency and such incompetence is
       unacceptable.

Ms M P COETZEE-KASPER: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that six men escaped unhurt when their 30m boat ran aground six
       sea miles off Kommetjie when the engine of their boat failed
       yesterday;


  (2) further notes that the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) rescued
       the six men and brought them to safety; and


  (3) commends the volunteers of the NSRI for saving the lives of these six
       men.
[Applause.]

Ms F HAJAIG: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at the next sitting I shall
move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, the hon Aziz
       Pahad, arrived with a South African Government delegation in Japan on
       Tuesday to establish a formal framework for discussion set to begin
       soon between the two countries;


  (2) further notes that the delegation includes senior officials from the
       Departments of Foreign Affairs, Health, Trade and Industry and of
       Arts, Culture, Science and Technology;


  (3) believes that formal trade relations, cultural and social exchange
       programmes between the two countries will enhance people-to-people
       relationships; and


  (4) wishes the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, the hon Aziz Pahad,
       and his delegation good luck in their mission.
[Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I have been
requested by the backbenchers of the IFP to raise the fact that because of
the hot air coming from both sides, they are getting cooked back there.
[Laughter.]

                              LESOTHO ELECTIONS

                             (Draft resolution)

Mr F BHENGU: Madam Speaker, I move without notice on behalf of the Chief
Whip of the Majority Party:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the people of Lesotho will go to the polls on Saturday, 25 May
           2002; and


       (b)  the South African Government will send an elections observer
           team to Lesotho to observe the elections;


  (2) calls on the people of Lesotho to -


       (a)  go to the polls; and
       (b)  work towards ensuring that the results of these elections are a
           credible expression of the will of the people of Lesotho.

Agreed to.

                     BAFANA BAFANA'S VICTORY OVER TURKEY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I hereby move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) celebrates with Bafana Bafana on their 2-0 win over Turkey to clinch
       the Reunification Cup;


  (2) congratulates the South African team on their inspirational
       performance; and


  (3) assures them that the whole of South Africa is behind them as they
       begin their World Cup campaign.
Agreed to.

                              AFRICA UNITY DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr F BHENGU: Madam Speaker, I move without notice on behalf of the Chief
Whip of the Majority Party:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that tomorrow, 25 May, is Africa Unity Day;


  (2) believes that the unity of Africa is a critical foundation stone for
       the development of our country and region, and for Africa to take its
       rightful place in the international community; and


  (3) pledges to work for the unity, peace, prosperity and development of
       the African continent.

Agreed to.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, there is certainly no objection. We have no
problem with the motion at all. But, the general convention of the House is
that if one proposes a motion without notice, it is on behalf of the House
and not on behalf of a political party.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Yes, hon member, it is on behalf of the House.
What the hon member is saying is that he is standing in for the Chief Whip
of the Majority Party to move the motion on behalf of the House.
[Interjections.]

 EXTENSION OF DATE FOR FILLING OF VACANCY IN COMMISSION FOR GENDER EQUALITY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr F BHENGU: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Chief Whip of the Majority
Party, I move the draft resolution printed in his name on the Order Paper,
as follows:

That, notwithstanding the resolution adopted on 20 March 2002, the date by
which the Ad Hoc Committee on Filling of Vacancy in Commission for Gender

Agreed to.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 14 - Arts, Culture, Science and Technology:

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Madam Speaker, my
colleagues in this House, visitors who have come to participate as this
important Vote is debated, the young people of our country whom I see up
there in the galleries - I am very happy that they are here this morning -
all the ladies and gentlemen present who work for the Government, the press
and the administrative staff of our Parliament, I consider this an
excellent time to introduce the Budget Vote for my Ministry. The month of
May has been memorable indeed for culture and science. It has been a month
of homecomings, a gathering to the hearth.

We have welcomed back two travellers in space and time - travellers whose
rather different experiences capture our diversity, travellers who, in many
ways, embody our national motto: !Ke E: /Xarra //Ke  [Unity in diversity].
But more than this links these travellers. Their respective journeys speak
to both science and culture, and, beyond this, to ethics and values.

The first traveller is known as Sarah Baartman, a name given to this slave
woman by her owners, certainly not the name by which her own people knew
her. Sarah Baartman is home at last. Her long walk to dignity is nearly
over. Sarah Baartman's life and death epitomise the wrongs of the
particular colonialism that our part of the globe was subjected to.
Identified as an object of curiosity by an English surgeon, Sarah was lured
to Europe, there to be paraded as a supposed freak and used as an object of
sexual pleasure. She died impoverished in Paris at the beginning of the
century that saw the emergence of the eugenics movement, which spewed forth
theories of race and superiority, and in which the genesis of Nazi ideology
and our own apartheid system was laid.

After complex negotiations with the French government - negotiations, that
required the passage of a special law in their National Assembly - Sarah
Baartman was welcomed back to the land of her forebears. We express our
thanks to the Presidency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their work
in this regard. Particular recognition is due to my colleague Mrs Brigitte
Mabandla for spearheading this initiative and to Prof Tobias for his
assistance, freely provided over many years, and in particular for his
leadership in negotiations with Prof Henry de Lumley of the Musee de
L'Homme in Paris. Our appreciation is also extended to the people of France
for upholding their national credo.

The fuelling of racial divisiveness is something that we shall always
resist, and the vigour with which we have pursued the rights of Ms Baartman
is testimony to that. It is our intention, finally, to inter Sarah Baartman
with honour and dignity next Women's Day, 9 August 2002. [Applause.] We
respect our human and cultural diversity. We would ask and expect others to
do the same. Sarah has travelled home through time.

The other traveller who came home safely is our start-up innovator, Mark
Shuttleworth, the space traveller. His journey was different. Mark was not
abducted; he paid his way. It is a tribute to his personal energy and the
education system that nurtured him that he also earned the respect of the
space professionals with whom he worked. I would like to welcome Mark
Shuttleworth home. He has served as an inspiration with his own special
brand of audacity.

In our context, I would prefer to think of it in terms of accountability.
Cabinet has declared its commitment towards research and technology
development as an important component of economic growth. My department is
now finalising the national strategy for research and development that is
based on a number of new technology missions. Alongside support for
existing research portfolios in health, minerals and agriculture, we wish
to launch specific thrusts in biotechnology and information technology, and
see a concerted drive to harness a range of technologies toward poverty
reduction. The strategy will be informed by the identification of objective
indicators that will allow careful monitoring and assessment of
performance.
Since 1994 we have nurtured and safeguarded the African continent's
remarkable science, engineering and technology capability, which resides
mainly in South Africa. The period of transition marked the removal of the
technology missions that dominated research and development in the 1970s
and 1980s. Military dominance, energy self-sufficiency and an aggressive
nuclear programme were the critical missions. South Africa has now beaten
its Redistribution and Development swords into plough shears, focusing on
health, household foods, food security, advanced manufacturing and human
resource development. These are practical outcomes of public science in
support of a better quality of life for all and a robust, competitive and
thriving economy.

As I have reported in earlier years, the science system has been
extensively reviewed and many parts are now world class. In the millennial
year 2000, President Mbeki received the output of the research and
technology foresight, which covered the future technology challenges in
sectors of critical importance to the economy and our society.

At the Cabinet lekgotla in January this year, we were requested to produce
a national research and development strategy to address critical issues for
the future of the country. The science and technology system of South
Africa, as robust as it sometimes appears, was designed for five million
people rather than the true figure of 40 million.

With the removal of the apartheid technology missions between 1990 and
1994, Government R&D spending decreased significantly. This Government has
maintained investment in real terms, but new missions and new resources are
critical to the future of South Africa. Both Government and the private
sector need to do more. It would be premature to elaborate on the full
scope of the strategy that we will present to Government during the next
quarter, but the strategic analysis is clear: knowledge economies need
sustained high levels of Government R&D and require innovation partnerships
with the private sector to stimulate and sustain wealth creation.

As we reflect on the challenge of serving all our people, we celebrate the
leadership of institutions like the iThemba Laboratories - iThemba Labs, as
it is called. Many of the members might remember it as the National
Accelerator Centre based in Faure in the Western Cape. The commitment and
energy of this national facility in working across universities and
technikons to produce students, mentor learners and continue to strengthen
science and health programmes is a credit to the highest values of the
scientific enterprise and community. [Applause.]

Our science councils and national facilities should not just be encouraged
to follow this path, but should be specifically mandated to educate and
train more scientists and engineers in the years to come within the more
flexible and responsive tertiary education system we intend to build.

The strategy we intend to present to Cabinet will achieve significant
growth rates in the number of new young scientists for South Africa. Where
practical, we intend to draw back to the country those researchers and
engineers who left our shores because they believed they had reached the
ceiling of their personal development. For those who remain abroad, we have
developed initiatives such as the SA Skills Network Abroad, commonly know
as Sansa, hosted by the National Research Foundation. Sansa is developing a
committed diaspora that retains positive intellectual and emotional links
to South Africa.

We are going to give special attention to technikons to strengthen their
technology support for SMMEs. We are expanding the Tsumisano Technology
Stations Programme, partly funded by European money, and the Godisa
innovation and incubator programme, which is one of our partnerships with
the Department of Trade and Industry and the European Union. The EU is
providing support and proving to be a valuable partner in these projects.

As Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, I was very honoured
to launch, during March, in Cape Town, the report on 10 years of research
co-operation between the EU and the SADC community, together with the new
ambassador to South Africa, the hon Michael Lake. Adding to the
significance of the occasion was the presence of the African, Caribbean and
the Pacific nations' Secretary-General, the hon Mr Kulungani.

The critical role of science, technology and innovation to achieve our
objectives in Nepad and in the World Summit on Sustainable Development must
not be underestimated. Our purposeful efforts to address poverty and the
burden of disease will be strengthened if we avoid being passive recipients
of the technologies and knowledge of others, and become full partners in
achieving a knowledge-based economy. This will require the consistent focus
of the athlete achieving the goal, winning the race.

The success of our science, engineering and technology week this year
convinces me that we are raising the level of awareness and interest in
scientific careers among our young people. We need to support their dreams
by providing challenging and effective innovation missions to reduce
poverty and, hence, the use of ICT in our lives, commerce, better use of
our natural resources and build on the increased strengths of our export
industry. The coelacanth, the Southern skies and oceans, Antarctica, the
cradle of humankind and the Cape floristic kingdom are part of our
heritage, but also of our future.

A new generation of young scientists need to be inspired by the endless
frontiers of scientific endeavour. My department also focuses on out-of-
school educational initiatives to complement the curriculum in classroom-
based activities of the Department of Education. This is proving to be a
valuable partnership, but we remain seriously concerned that less than 5%
of matriculants receive university exemptions in maths and science.

I salute the dedicated science and maths teachers and volunteers who commit
to out-of-school programmes in maths and science to inspire the future Mark
Shuttleworths of our nation. These programmes and the NGOs who have
developed them need increased support. We need additional creative
initiatives to make these subjects not simply accessible, but exciting and
vibrant. The dedicated efforts of these teachers and NGOs have paid
dividends with hundreds of passes. We now need them in thousands.
[Applause.]

During the past financial year we allocated and tracked the expenditure of
all the poverty relief money allocated to our department. We are going to
ensure that these programmes move people out of poverty and create new
entrepreneurs and SMMEs. The DACST poverty relief initiatives spur on craft
industries and technology-based small enterprises, and embrace the use of
resources such as natural fibres for paper-making and textiles. The
intention is that the enterprises becomes sustainable and continue to
create expanding employment through training and adoption of effective
technologies, as well as effective market development strategies.

If we were asked how we are doing in this regard, the answer would somewhat
have to be circumscribed. Our spending, which is currently estimated to be
0,7% of GDP, is low and has been steady at this level for the past few
years. In the early 90s the previous government wound up major strategic
missions in military technology and energy sufficiency. Accordingly, R&D
spending fell.

Today the financial pressures facing higher education, the brain drain and
the absence of a strong R&D driver are contributing to a dangerous greying
of the R&D workforce. Our capacity as a leading science and technology
player among the emerging economies is being put at risk, unless we bring
our investments in research and development in line with those of emerging
countries such as Finland, Chile and Korea, which have embraced their
knowledge in terms of the future.

In our globalising economy, where our own multinationals are shifting their
headquarters abroad, we need to ensure that the quality of life and the
research and business environment are attractive to our researchers and
entrepreneurs from abroad, who will want to come home and give substance to
our national system of innovation. This is one of the reasons that
Government is pushing the development of a university dedicated to
excellence in the information and communications technologies. We want to
participate in world-class development and be an attractive place to study
and work. What we do not want is to be subjected to the mining of our
intellectual capital.

Currently significant effort is being put into gaining a better
understanding of three key features of our national system of innovation.
The Human Sciences Research Council together with the National Advisory
Council on Innovation will by the end of the year have provided us with
hard data on the inputs that go into our research and development system,
the factors affecting the movement of R & D personnel and the impact of
publicly funded research.

This information will allow for a much better understanding of what is
going into the R & D system and will form the basis for careful
consideration of the extent to which state funding might increase and where
that increase might be targeted.

The capacity to deploy that funding in accordance with our goals for
national development in part depends on the quality of leadership in place
in the science councils. I wish to use this opportunity to congratulate Dr
Khotso Mokhele, president of the National Research Foundation, for the rare
feat of acquiring three honorary doctorates in as many weeks, and also
recognise the new energy that the appointment of Dr Sibusiso Sibisi as
president of the CSIR brings to this organisation. [Applause.]

Science is one part of our cultural entitlement. I wish now to turn to the
other cultures. My Ministry has been criticised for apparently spending too
little on the performing arts, for allowing orchestras to go to the wall
and for neglecting the classics. Our policies in this regard have stood the
test of time. We have worked from the basis that our highly diverse and
economically stratified communities have many interests and varying
abilities to pay for artistic and cultural experience. Strange, then, is
the fact that the number of orchestras has been rising in the last few
years and strange too that the playhouses are now performing to packed
houses, night after night. Patrons, it seems, are prepared to pay top rand
for what they enjoy.

We have also worked from the basis that an agenda of redress is appropriate
in order to correct bias and imbalance and to promote nation-building. It
is a pleasure, therefore, to note that the culture Vote is set to rise by
an average of 25% per year over the next three years.

Our progress in convincing Cabinet collegues of the dynamic possibilities
for the cultural industries has resulted in these significant budget
increases. A total of R102 million has been allocated over and above our
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework allocation for arts and culture for the
2002-03 financial year. An amount of R17 million has been allocated to the
transformation of heritage institutions, R20 million for cultural
industries, R50 million for Freedom Park and R15 million for a new harbour
wall on Robben Island so that the visitors are not endangered.

It is an even greater pleasure to note the way that the private sector has
worked with Government to give substance to the vision of the Robben Island
Gateway project and the Robben Island Museum itself. These facilities are
designed to world standards, are well patronised and serve as a living
tribute to the freedom struggle.

The project that will have the widest impact given its physical location,
is the Freedom Park that is now taking shape under the guidance of the
previous chairperson of our portfolio committee, the poet and writer
Mongane Wally Serote. Freedom Park will be a monument to our collective
struggle for dignity and human rights.

Cabinet in 1998 approved this project, which will lead to the design and
construction of a number of commemorative structures at Salvokop in the
capital city. These structures will celebrate the rich tapestry of our
lives from the earliest times as the cradle of humankind, through the stone
and iron ages and the agrarian era to the ages of conflict and
colonisation. The struggle for democracy and the present will also be
typified. A sum of R350 million has been allocated to these works over the
MTEF period.

I would like to refer to the language mandate that is given to us by
Cabinet and by the people of this country. We are in the process of
finalising a national language policy that was carefully developed and
tested with all stakeholders.

However, more importantly, we are busy with a range of practical
interventions in the area of language. I want to mention a number of
projects that are underway to ensure that language supports personal
development and economic participation.

Members will recall that on 15 March we launched the Telephone Interpreting
Service for South Africa. The Telephone Interpreting Service for South
Africa was developed in collaboration with PanSALB and the University of
the Free State. Of course, I should say ``dankie mense'' [Thank you,
everyone]. [Applause.]

We have also established a film fund, which is located in the National Film
and Video Foundation, and the allocation for this is R35 million. I do hope
that within a few years we shall have some exceptional blockbuster feature
films coming out of our history, heritage and experience as a people.
[Applause.]

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology, hon Deputy Minister and colleagues, allow me to indulge the
House on the experience my family once had at the peak of the apartheid
era.

We had been to Cape Town on a visit and were on our way back to the Eastern
Cape, driving along the N2 highway. Having learnt about the Cango Caves at
school and suddenly realising how close we were to this famous South
African heritage site, we decided to branch off at Mossel Bay and drive
towards Oudtshoorn.

On arrival at the Cango Caves, and from where we parked our car, we could
visibly see the entrance to the caves. We were excited at this achievement
and at the thought of what we were about to witness. But, alas! Right there
in front of us was a huge information board on which was listed the days of
the week on which the different races, ie whites, Indians, Coloureds and
Africans, could visit the caves.

To our disappointment and disgust the day we had chosen to visit the site
was not for visiting by Africans. Unbelievable! It so happened that the
visiting day for Africans was the following day. There stood a beautiful
hotel nearby and we enquired if we could spend the night there. No, it was
for whites only, we were told.

From the parking ground we could see with envy white people going in and
out of the caves. Could we go as far as the entrance, at least, we asked.
Of course not, we were reminded. Angry and disgusted at the thought that it
was our colour that prevented us from visiting the natural heritage site,
we drove away.

With the creation of a new Department of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology since the democratic Government came into power, South Africa is
gradually, step by step, moving away from her painful past - a past in
which even natural heritage sites could detect racial differences.

Through the creation of the department, heritage resources and facilities
are not only preserved but are popularised, democratised and open to all
South Africans, regardless of race, colour or status. The ANC-led
Government created the department because it recognised that through arts,
culture and language promotion, a sense of national identity and pride
would be cultivated.

Arts and culture are thus a potentially unifying force in a country that
was divided along ethnic and cultural lines by the apartheid system.
Recognising that it is a foundation for the community and tradition, and
that it can be a powerful vehicle for the transformation of society, the
department aims, amongst other things, to stimulate, nurture and protect
the arts, culture and heritage of our country.
The activities of the department cover a very wide range, much wider than
many of us imagine, including the MPs themselves. These activities range
from overseeing and financially supporting community arts centres on the
ground; supporting and developing the music, film and video industry;
establishing cultural industries; ensuring the preservation of national
archives, museums, libraries and heritage sites; and supporting the work of
the science councils, research, etc.

Comparing the budget allocation to this plethora of responsibilities and
litany of programmes undertaken by the department, we can safely conclude
that the funds cannot be said to be adequate. The Government does need to
devise a strategy to allocate additional funds if these noble tasks are to
be carried out as expected and as required. This observation is backed by
the fact that in almost all the presentations on the annual report by
stakeholders to the portfolio committee, the common complaint was that
policies could be better implemented if more funds were available.

However, it is encouraging to note that despite these limitations the
budget allocation for arts, culture, science and technology has been
revised upwards by R145,2 million in the current financial year, and R315,5
million in the next financial year. Notable also is the fact that arts,
culture, science and technology spending dominates the department's budget.
One of the new projects that will benefit from this spending is the Freedom
Park project at Salvokop in Pretoria, which was mentioned by the Minister.
It is an important project with significant themes, touching on the
struggle for liberation, democracy and nation-building. It is a project
aimed at reflecting the precolonial, colonial, apartheid and postapartheid
eras, phases of democratisation and the development of the South African
nation. It is gratifying, therefore, to note that this museum will include
the women's struggles as well. [Applause.]

It is a project that promises to involve the whole nation in its entirety.
Thus the appointment of Comrade Dr Wally Serote, the chairperson of the
portfolio committee since 1994 up to April this year, to oversee the
development of a national project of this magnitude, could not have come at
a better moment. On behalf of the portfolio committee, I wish to
congratulate Dr Serote on his appointment and wish him success in this new
challenging deployment. We do not doubt his ability to face up to this
challenge. We trust that the allocation that has been given to the project
over the medium term will see the project started.

We acknowledge the additional funding to the cultural industries. Given
enough financial clout, this directorate can go a long way in creating
jobs, alleviating poverty and consequently reducing crime. Much work has
been done in promoting South African crafts, including exhibitions abroad.
The department has a list of these cultural industries and their locations
in the provinces. It would therefore be helpful if the MPs could visit
those located in their constituencies to find out how they are progressing.

The department plans to establish craft and music expert councils. This
will not only stimulate the creation of more jobs for our artists, but will
also promote South Africa's cultural image internationally, and so will the
participation of the department in the World Summit for Sustainable
Development, the WSSD imbizo, in August and September this year. We hope
that artists and crafters from rural areas will not be left out.

With regard to the preservation of archives and museums, I believe drastic
transformation needs to take place, in particular in terms of the content
of these institutions. These are still dominated by information and
artefacts from the old order. There is a need to broaden the content to
reflect today's South African society.

In addition there is a need for more clarity on the governance of archives.
The role of the provinces and local government needs to be clearly defined
and supported financially. There is also a dire need for capacity-building
in this sector.

The Bureau of Heraldry, though, is to be congratulated on its success in
creating a distinct South African idiom, depicting the diversity of South
African society as seen in the production of the new coat of arms, emblems
such as the flag, medals and so on. With the PanSALB legislation in place
and an increasing budget allocation over the medium term, the linguistic
diversity of the country should develop progressively.

We wish to congratulate the department on the strategic plan it has set up
to guide its programmes over the next few years. We acknowledge the
developments in science and technology in our country and the work done
under very challenging circumstances, from the erection of the South
African Large Telescope, or Salt, in Sutherland to the work currently being
done by the science councils at the World Summit on Sustainable
Development.

It is important that South African science is showcased also within Africa
through participation in Nepad. Developing our role in Africa is certainly
of paramount importance. We note the increased focus on Africa's indigenous
knowledge systems and their link to global science and technology systems.
We are aware of the responsibilities these choices carry with them, but
there is a need to address key indicators in the medium term such as the
number of researchers as a percentage of the total workforce, the
development of human capital in the indigenous knowledge system and the
critical area of public understanding of science, engineering and
technology in order to close the ever widening gap between the rich and the
poor.

In his state of the nation address, President Mbeki stressed the centrality
of mathematics and science as part of the human resources development
strategy. Currently, the number of learners who pass mathematics and
science in Grade 12 is very low. The Minister has also alluded to this
fact.

The key challenge of the department, however, is to manage such a diverse
integrated portfolio with all its potential and challenges.

In conclusion, may we congratulate the Minister, the Deputy Minister and
the department on having successfully negotiated and effected the return to
South Africa, of the remains of Ms Saartjie Baartman, thus ending centuries
of humiliation of black people by previous colonial powers. [Applause.] To
us, Saartjie remains our national heritage and should be treated as such.

May I also thank the director-general and his staff for the co-operation
given me thus far as the new chairperson of the portfolio committee and
also my colleagues, the members of the committee, for their co-operation
and understanding. Please let us not forget what the Minister has informed
us about, namely Africa Freedom Day tomorrow. [Applause.]

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Mev die Speaker, ek weet nou nie waar die agb Marthinus
van Schalkwyk gaan wegkruip het nie ... [Tussenwerpsels] ... maar ek wou
vir hom gesê het: As Harksen soveel geld gegee het, en as Leon geweet het,
en as Bester geweet het, en as Morkel geweet het, dan vind ek dit baie
vreemd dat Marthinus van Schalkwyk niks geweet het, en dit terwyl hy
destyds die adjunkleier van die DA was. [Tussenwerpsels.] Hy was ook
hooffondsinsamelaar en 'n top man in die Nuwe NP. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN: Madam Speker, I don't know where the honourable Marthinus
van Schalkwyk is hiding ... [Interjections] ... but I wanted to tell him:
If Harksen gave so much money, and if Leon had known, and if Bester had
known, and if Morkel had known, then I find it very strange that Marthinus
van Schalkwyk did not know anything, and this while he was still deputy
leader of the DA. [Interjections.] He was also the main funds collector and
a top man in the New NP.]

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This, I believe, is
a debate on Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, unless the speaker is
versing us in forensic science. [Interjections.] I do not see the relevance
of his comments.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Well, let us give the hon member a chance. He
might just make the connection. [Laughter.]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Madam Speaker, it is part of the drama.

Ek het groot waardering vir die waardes wat die Departement van Kuns,
Kultuur, Wetenskap en Tegnologie hom ten doel gestel het, naamlik
professionalisme, bekwaamheid, verantwoordbaarheid en deursigtigheid. Dit
is die tipe waardes wat pas by almal wat ernstig is om op 'n inklusiewe
wyse uitdrukking te gee aan die skeppende potensiaal wat in ons almal is.
Hierdie waardes is onverhandelbaar. As ons die kuns en kultuur van al die
komponente van ons reënboognasie aan almal blootstel, behoort dit 'n
belangrike instrument te wees om binne ons nuwe demokrasie nasiebou te
bevorder. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I have great appreciation for the values which the Department of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology has as object, namely professionalism,
competence, responsibility and lucidity. These are the kinds of values
befitting everyone serious about giving expression in an inclusive way to
the creative potential in all of us. These values are non-negotiable. If we
expose the art and culture of all the components of our rainbow nation to
everyone, it should be an important instrument to promote nation-building
in our new democracy.]

Although the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology's budget
has more than doubled from 1995 to 2002, there was a downward trend in the
arts and culture programme since 1995-96, reaching its lowest percentage
point in 2000-01. The overall budget for Arts and Culture increases from
R362 million in 2001-02, to R495 million this year - an increase of 36,5%.
This is by far the largest increase this programme has seen since 1994, but
we must remember it was from a lower base.

In spite of this increase, most of our heritage organisations, with their
professional and export employees, are still underfunded. Some institutions
have not had their budgets increased by a cent in eight years. Others have
had an increase not even remotely close to keeping in touch with inflation,
while others have had their budgets slashed dramatically, reducing their
capacity to provide sound, professional services.

There was also a significant decline in infrastructure, companies, capacity
and jobs over the last number of years in the area of performing arts - top
singers, choreographers, dancers, musicians and actors are leaving the
industry.

Are we really serious about our mission to stimulate, to nurture and to
protect arts and culture when there is an annual increase in the number of
jobs in DACST, with substantial improvement in remuneration, while jobs are
shed in the arts and culture institutions, which are doing the cultural
work?

The ongoing drama around the State Theatre is not enhancing our vision for
transparency and accountability. After five years of investigation by
various investigating agencies no money has been recovered and no one has
been held accountable. Meredy Wixley and Arlette Franks, who lost their
jobs because they blew the whistle on irregularities, are still out in the
cold. There may be many reasons for the delay, but five years is a very
long time and speculations are rife about the reasons for the delay. The
time has now arrived to settle this matter once and for all so that some
people can get on with their lives.

We appreciate all the initiatives for economic development and poverty
reduction. But I believe there is still a lot to be done to realise our
full potential. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Madam
Speaker, the hon the Minister, and colleagues, I wish to start my speech
with a poem. Kindly indulge me.


  I've come to take you home -
  home, remember the veld?
  the lush green grass beneath the big oak trees
  the air is cool there and the sun doesn't burn.


  I have made your bed at the foot of the hill,
  your blankets are covered in buchu and mint,
  the proteas stand in yellow and white
  and the water in the stream chuckles sing-songs
  as it hobbles along over the little stones.


  I have come to wrench you away
  away from the poking eyes
  of the man-made monster
  who lives in the dark
  with his clutches of imperialism
  who dissects your body bit by bit
  who likens your soul to that of Satan
  and declares himself the ultimate god!


  I have come to take you home
  where I will sing for you
  for you have brought me peace.

This is an extract from a poem written in celebration of Sarah Baartman by
Diana Ferrus, a wonderful and compassionate woman I am privileged to have
met. [Applause.] Regrettably, Diana Ferrus is not able to be with us today
as she is attending a funeral in Worcester. The poem stands as a record in
French legislative history, since the translated verses are part of the
enabling law that released Sarah Baartman from her two centuries of captive
humiliation.

There are others whose role in this homecoming must be recognised. In
France, I would like to mention Anne Sophie Parisot, personal assistant to
Senator Nicholas About, who first saw this poem on a local website, and
brought it to the notice of the senator; Senator Nicholas About, who
sponsored the necessary Bill, and the Minister of Research, Minister Roger-
Gerard Schwartzenberg, who made a very moving speech at the handing-over
ceremony, affirming the right to human dignity.

On the South African side, we recognise both the former and present
ambassadors to France, that is, Madam Barbara Masekela and the present
ambassador to France, who is Ms Skweyiya, who, in fact, alerted us to the
debate earlier this year; Professor Tobias for his effort and persistence,
and to the National Khoisan Consultative Conference for its guidance in
this matter.

We are now preparing for the interment of Sarah Baartman's remains. I am
pleased to inform the House that the consultation with key stakeholders
such as the National Khoisan Consultative Conference is proceeding well. I
am confident that the interment of Sarah Baartman will be successful.

The return of Sarah Baartman is about affirming our commitment to human
rights. Similarly, the change of the old symbols and orders to new ones
affirms our history and helps us build an inclusive nation in recognition
of all our human rights.

To this end, in the area of heraldry, we have made significant progress in
the past seven years in defining who we are and what we stand for as a
nation. As we all know, on Freedom Day this year, the new national orders
were inaugurated: The Order of Mapungubwe, the Order of the Baobab and the
Order of the Companions of O R Tambo. I wish to take this opportunity to
thank the Presidency for its guidance. I wish, also, to reiterate the
commendation made by the President to Gold Mametja in creating the design
for the new national orders.

Let me now turn to the challenges the department is addressing in the area
of cultural industry. As the Minister pointed out, a skills development
training strategy has been developed for the craft, film, design and music
sectors together with the Department of Labour. What I really need to say
now is to urge all interested parties to help us make this a success.

In the area of music, the Legal Aid Board is in discussions with us, and we
are looking at the possibility of the Wits Law Clinic being used to launch
Help for Musicians.

During the last financial year, the department has actively promoted the
use of new knowledge in support of communities and groups that wish to
develop craft and technology-based businesses. Jobs have been created in
the area of paper-making, as the Minister has indicated, as well as soap
production and craft industries, to mention but a few.

These industries are based on the use of renewable resources on a
sustainable basis. They are intended to assist the participants to become
more independent entrepreneurs. Design is as important in the technological
process as it is in craft development. In this regard I am pleased to note
the excellent collaboration that has emerged across Government departments
that are working together. These are the Departments of Education, Water
Affairs and Forestry, and Minerals and Energy, as well as the SABS and
CSIR.

The importance of design is now recognised through the annual South African
Design Week. The department is underwriting all these collaborative
initiatives. In the area of technology, we have established technology
stations. T[s]homisano, meaning partnership or co-operation, has been
chosen as a brand name for this programme. It provides support to South
African enterprises by facilitating access to the expertise and capacity of
technikons via the intermediary services of technology stations. It will
strengthen and accelerate the interaction between technikons, as the
Minister has indicated, and small and medium enterprises.

In the first round initiated in 1999, our department selected four
technikons for the establishment of technology stations, and these are
Technikon Pretoria in the field of electronics and electrical engineering,
Technikon Free State, in Bloemfontein, in metal value adding, Technikon
North West, Garankuwa in chemicals and the Mangosuthu Technikon Durban in
chemicals.

In the second round, the department selected three more technikons in
February, and these are Vaal Triangle in the field of composites, Port
Elizabeth Technikon in the field of automotive components and Peninsula
Technikon in the field of textiles and clothing. We have also initiated
another technology programme. The Minister referred to this one. This is
called Godisa. We began funding this programme in the year 2001. Currently,
there are eight programmes - four of these are fully functional and the
other four are new centres which have just received their funds. All
centres are at various stages of development.

To give an example of the impact of these programmes in South Africa and in
our communities, we will use the Zenzele Technology Demonstration Centre,
TDC, which is based at Mintek. The purpose of TDC is to provide technical
and research support to small-scale mining enterprises resulting in
accelerated business growth, skills development and job creation.

The centre helps enterprises to compete successfully in their market. In
the approximately six months that the centre has been in operation, 35
initiatives have already been undertaken in Gauteng, Northern Cape,
Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. These initiatives
involved approximately 537 individual miners, 96% to 97% of which are black
and 20% women. I must say that this project is, politically, being led by
the Minister of Minerals and Energy.

During the course of the current financial year, the department will
allocate R50 million to the first phase of the national biotechnology
strategy. This strategy is not intended to serve a narrow set of interests
for a favoured few. South Africa's biotechnology strategy has been
strengthened with a public consultation process that has endorsed our own
view. Biotechnology has great potential to serve the needs of all South
Africans.

A study tour of Cuba in January and consideration of the strategies of
countries such as Brazil, Malaysia and Nigeria reinforced this assessment.
Of all recent technological development, biotechnology directly connects
with the rich indigenous knowledge and extensive biological resources of
our subcontinent. This creates opportunities to reduce the burden of
disease, improve food security and establish industries that will generate
a new wealth.

I wish to say that there is concern that there has been very little proper
assessment of the current contribution and future potential of women in
science and technology in our country. However, investigations of the
authorship of scientific publications by South African women shows little
progress over the past ten years. Women who are leaders in their fields are
positive and effective role models, but some domains remain dominantly
male. In others, there has, it seems, been some progress, or so we are
told. This domain needs positive attention, proper investigation and
proactive planning.

We have therefore initiated the establishment of a reference group of
leading women in science and technology to give positive impetus to
initiatives to redress the persistent gender imbalances within our national
system of innovation, which all too easily becomes the accepted norm.

In the context of global and regional issues affecting women in science and
technology, we will work to ensure strengthened contributions by women
within the national system of innovation, and address the levels of
participation in maths and science by girls in our schools.

Let me take this opportunity to congratulate Dr Serote on his appointment
at Freedom Park and also MaNjobe on her appointment as chairperson of the
portfolio committee, and to say to all of us ``Happy Africa Day!'' - I am
not sure if we say that. Let us reflect on our commitment as a nation to
helping to rebuild the socioeconomic infrastructure of our continent.
[Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, let me begin by first of all congratulating Dr
Mokhehle, Dr Sibisi, Dr Wally Serote, Mark Shuttleworth and MaNjobe on
their various achievements. Secondly, I wish to ditto everything that the
Minister, Deputy Minister and MaNjobe had to say.

As far as Mr Opperman is concerned, I think, in respect of the State
Theatre, he should know very well that in the dying days of the apartheid
regime, the State Theatre made itself into a section 21 company, precisely
because it did not want the new state to oversee its affairs. No wonder it
was overtaken by financial disasters of its own making, for which the
department could not, in any way, be blamed.  As far as we now concerned,
it has become part of the national arts institutes and therefore control
will be reasserted.

This is the eighth time that I have had the privilege, on behalf of the
IFP, to address the House on this Vote. Over these eight years, the
department has made enormous progress with a limited budget. Even today
that budget stands at just three quarters of a billion rand.

Their great achievement is especially true in the area of science and
technology. The use of strategic investments in science, therefore, is the
only big option that is open to us and the department is using that option.
Thanks to our being an open democracy, we have as a country established
links and bilateral relations with many highly industrialised friendly
countries. This compensates somewhat for the limited investments that we
ourselves as a Government are making in science and technology.

In other areas like the arts, the department operates at arm's length so
that the state may never again impose a new hegemony on our diverse people
with our diverse languages, beliefs and cultures. We have no way around
that. At the same time, the department has to realise the full potential of
both arts and science in the social and economic development that has to be
undertaken. For this reason, the promotion of job creation in the cultural
industries has become an area of central focus, and must remain an area of
central focus for many years.

This focus is also supported by the medium-term allocations in the budget
for cultural industries. There is no doubt, none whatsoever, that this is
the way to go.

Our oversight and monitoring functions must therefore ensure that all who
are entrusted with the responsibility of promoting job creation, through
the cultural industries, are given substantial autonomy and even financial
incentives in terms of the PFMA to deliver. We cannot countenance minimal
outputs here. After all, the Cultural Industries Growth Strategy was
initiated in 1997 and, after five years, we should as a country be
capitalising on the truly vast economic potential of the craft, music, film
and publishing industries.

Let me underscore the enormous emphasis we as parliamentarians are placing
on the cultural industries, as the Ministry does, to answer the cries of
the jobless. The department, through public-private partnerships, the Music
Industry Task Team and the Print Industry Cluster Council, has the
necessary avenues for job creation and urban regeneration.

Our collective mandate is to deliver adequately on the promise of a better
life for all. We therefore need to look deeply at what is happening in our
cities, towns, villages and rural areas. Eight years have passed. The
number of beneficiaries from our programme should be rising incrementally
and significantly. The councils and the agencies that derive funds from the
department should begin to show quantitatively and qualitatively what is
being done to bring about a better life for all.

The fundamentals in our country and our economy are sound, but jobs still
continue to be shed. Four out of ten of employable people, according to
analysts, are consistently out of jobs. My own eyes reveal the same truth.

I accept that the half a billion rand the department has for arts and
culture is inadequate for what needs to be done. There is no argument about
that. The question, though, is whether the best strategies are being
employed and whether the councils are performing the near miracles which we
expect them to perform. Now we in South Africa are a unique partnership and
together, as Team South Africa we can scale the tallest mountains.
President Thabo Mbeki has issued a clarion call for the African
Renaissance, Nepad and Vukuzenzele. We should rally by going beyond the
call of duty.

But are we rallying? As consumers, in this nation, do we support our home-
grown products. I believe that we should follow the example of the way in
which the French support their culture and French cinema. South Africa must
indeed take a leaf from France's book, and in a hurry. Our portfolio
committee is ready and willing to support the Ministry in whichever way we
can.

We need to dramatically increase the output of our films, videos and
documentaries through joint ventures and other strategies. We have the
technical base. We also have the great stories, as the Minister has
indicated, of singular success in avoiding catastrophic wars and of
engaging in the greater social experiment in the history of the world.
These stories must be told. Burkina Faso, Australia, India and other
countries are performing miracles, and we should do the same. Members of
this House and all those who are in politics will need to mobilise our
cinemagoers to spread their rands so that our own home-grown products begin
to enjoy success.

Now let me turn my attention to music. In music, also, we have an enormous
depth of talent, a depth that is equal to the platinum mines of South
Africa. Some of our underutilised universities could be used as performing
schools and recording studios. The phenomenal success of the new opera
Princess Magogo kaDinuzulu indicates the wonderful potential that still has
to be realised in South Africa. Let us look at the experience of India in
developing the talents of its people, both in the film and music
industries, and let us see what we can do to catch up.

Another area that still remains to be developed is the archeological sites.
While the Cradle of Humankind is being developed, we need to give
consideration to the other significant sites that we have. The R6 billion-
odd of investments that we have in our museums also need to be utilised
more economically in order that that R6 billion could bring investments
into the museums. I wish to suggest, once again, that we should have a
floating exhibition of some of our artefacts in co-operation and in
conjunction with the navy.

I would now like to turn to the major chain outlets of our country like
Pick 'n Pay, Woolworths, Spar and so on. I believe that these retailers
should be encouraged, out of patriotism, to set aside about 1% to 2% of
their total floor space for South African artefacts and products. If we
look at the glassware and many ornamental products that are sold in these
stores, we find that they are all sourced from outside. We need to give our
own small SMMEs an opportunity. I believe that through engaging these major
outlets in discussion, we would be able to ensure that there is greater
economic growth in our country.

Let us also briefly look at what we spend on the criminal justice system.
Correctional Services in South Africa uses up R7 billion, Safety and
Security uses over R19 billion and Justice takes R4 billion. If one adds on
top of that what many of our business people and private residents pay for
private security, then the amount exceeds the R30 billion that the
Government is already spending. What do we spend on arts and science
against the R30 billion that is spent on the criminal justice system? We
spend a mere R1,36 billion. It does not make good economic sense to be
merely spending on that end and not bolstering our sciences, arts and
economics.

I also wish to appeal to the Minister to explore the possibility of a South
Africa shop like the Australia shop. In London, New York and Paris the
South African flag is already well branded. The Minister and his colleagues
in Cabinet could discuss the viability of such a move. The other areas for
development are the new African cultural villages along the arterial
routes; central markets in the cities which focus on cultural products,
like those found in Malaysia; restaurants that also offer major cultural
events eg Marrakech in Morocco. Finally, I would like to repeat the call
for a South African experience along the lines of the Maltese experience in
Malta.

The budget document before us recognises the need to strengthen the crucial
links between strategic planning, budgeting, monitoring and, most
significantly, reporting on service delivery. These are indeed the crucial
links. We have made it compulsory for many of the councils to report to
Parliament and to make sure that they are delivering. If service delivery
takes place at a speedy and optimal level, we shall have the endorsement of
the voters, and the valid argument for substantially increasing the budget
of this department and of the very councils that we are talking about. If
not, the voters are going to regard us as failures and the Minister of
Finance will remain as close-fisted as he has been. We, in the portfolio
committee, promise not to fail.

The IFP supports the Vote. We support the programmes and the targets. We
are quite unhappy though that the Government investment in R & D is
declining. This, surely, is a mistake that must be taken up in Cabinet and
elsewhere. We support a steady and incremental growth in R & D in order
that we can remain competitive in global terms. I would like to say to
colleagues here that, on this thing, we cannot fail the country. We request
the public sector managers, in terms of the Public Finance Management Act,
to use the greater autonomy and flexibility now given to them to deliver as
effectively as possible. They know that we will play ball with them. That
is what we have done.

We also remain very anxious about mathematics and science in our schools,
and the Minister pointed this out. The number of postgraduate and doctoral
students taking up mathematics and science at university is absolutely
unacceptable.

Universities that want to retain their autonomy have failed themselves in
not attracting an adequate number of postgraduate and doctoral students for
these subjects. As country, we have to make sure that these things are put
right.

When it comes to language, we also need to ensure that we develop
vocabulary along all the languages, in order that South Africa can become a
multilingual society in which language becomes a strength and not a
weakness. The inability of South Africa to look at vocabulary development
is impeding that progress.

Finally, in all of the laboratories, theatres, observatories, museums,
archives, councils, departments, Parliament, etc, this is an area via which
we can ensure that South Africa becomes a significant player in Africa and
the world, so that Nepad can be a great success. [Applause.]

Mrs N D MBOMBO: Chairperson, hon Minister and fellow members, a long time
ago when they were in power, the previous government built toilets in the
veld which were never used by anybody. Let us not make our centres like
that.

The department's predicament is that arts centres fall under provincial
governments, but through Minmec there should be a co-ordination so they
should not blame each other for failure to implement policy as well as the
wishes of the representatives of the people, as expressed through the
portfolio committee.

Our committee provided a memorandum in which we highlighted various
programmes that should be promoted through such centres. We suggested the
following. Adjoining community art centres should be craft markets,
restaurants and work centres; in some, there should be a library,
information technology, a computer centre and an Abet centre.

In our view, the community art centres should be a hub around which a whole
range of activities should take place. We pointed out in our memo that if
the Government were to add these and other features, both the local and
overseas visitors would be attracted, thereby contributing to job creation
and other opportunities for people who are unemployed, as well as make a
positive contribution to the alleviation of poverty.

In countries such as the island of Malta, lace-making and glass ornaments
are a major tourist attraction. In Malaysia batik is equally attractive to
all visitors, and the spinning of cloth in India has been going on for
centuries. Thus, as a developing country we should use our art and culture
as a catalyst to economic development. Pottery, paper-making, meshing and a
whole host of local industries could be nurtured and expanded. As an
example of a working model of a community centre, village crafts are to be
found in Ouagadougou, in Burkina Faso, where whole families are engaged in
manufacturing, finishing and selling products ranging from ceramics, metal
items, woodwork and leather. Therefore, we plead with the department, once
again, to intensify its efforts by 5000% to make community art centres hubs
of local and cultural activities.

It is not plain sailing or a bed of roses for the community art centres in
our country. Some had to close down because of a lack of basic operational
financial provisions. Some are not fully utilised because of a lack of
focus per se and administrative direction. Some are working well and are a
pleasure to visit.

Therefore, a plea is made to all of us to imbue in the people in our
constituencies the spirit as enshrined in the statement made on 8 January
which, inter alia, provides:


  We must translate into reality, our vision of people-driven processes of
  change, as well as the fundamental principle that they are their own
  liberators.

By this, I mean for those centres to take off as expected and required by
our people. Our people should be encouraged to volunteer their services in
them, until they become financially viable. Let us now turn to another
painful issue in our community, namely that of the rural women. In rural
communities we believe that IKS sorghum and indigenous traditional brewing,
dance, music, etc should be supported on a preferential basis.

The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism is promoting a village
type of accommodation, in order that those who wish to experience the real
Africa can do so by watching the stars, listening to the tu-whitting of the
owls, dogs barking at the moon and stories about the births and deaths of
our kings, and waking up in the morning to the crow of the cock.

Kukurukukuuu. Ndikhumbul' eMbhasheee. Eeembo. Moolo mhlob' am. Ndlelantle
saana. Undibulisele kwezo weyi. Uthi kubhuti Nyawuza ndiza kumbhalela.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] The cock crows. I miss Mbhashe! Hello, my friend! Go well,
baby! Pass my regards to them there! Please tell brother Nyawuza that I
will write to him! [Applause.]

These are all opportunities begging to be taken up and used wisely and
economically, as well as recorded properly in our history books for the
next generation.
Our country has a lot of diversity, but we are one South Africa with many
cultures. This is the way of life we want experienced by people in the
country and used to attract international visitors to this country.
Therefore we would like to see the community arts centres as a microcosm of
this big vision of our way of life.

Simthembile uMphathiswa kunye nesekela lakhe, uNkskz Mabandla. Siyacela
kooMbomvu ukuba bawuphakamele lo mcimbi, basenze sibe ngabantu abanegugu
neqhayiya ngemveli namasiko abo, njengoko sebenzile. [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[We trust both the hon Minister and his deputy, Mrs Mabandla. We ask that
Mbomvu and his colleagues should take this matter up and make us proud of
our origin, culture and customs, as they have already done. [Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, can we appeal to you to
lower the noise level in the House. There are a number of side meetings
going on and these do not allow the member at the podium the opportunity to
be heard.

Mev ANNA VAN WYK: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek wil 'n beroep op die hoofswepe
doen om hierdie debat in die toekoms op 'n Dinsdagmiddag as eerste item op
die Ordelys te plaas, en agb lede het nou net gehoor hoekom.

Hierdie begrotingspos het te make met die siel van die nasie, en as sodanig
verdien dit veel meer prominensie. Die portefeuljekomitee is moeg daarvan
om alewig soos Aspoestertjie by die koue as van die week se verrigtings te
moet staan, en die koue pampoen wat my arme kollega dan ook nog aan ons wil
opdis, is iets wat ons nie wil eet nie, want almal weet mos dat die DP/DA
ons doelbewus in die duister gehou het oor hulle doen en late.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Die siel van die nasie is al belangrik genoeg, maar dit het ook te doen met
die hart en verstand, sowel as die produk van die nasie. Nou moet ek
dadelik sê, sedert die boekjaar 1995-96 het die begroting vir die pos meer
as verdubbel, iets waarvoor ek graag krediet wil gee. Oor hoe die
departementele toediening gemaak word, kan 'n mens redeneer, en ek wil
voorstel dat daar deeglik gekyk word na wat prioriteite behoort te wees.

Is dit byvoorbeeld regverdigbaar dat daar aan 'n eenmalige byeenkoms R5
miljoen uitgegee word terwyl 'n belangrike nasionale instelling soos die
William Humphreys-kunsgalery 'n jaar lank met R1,7 moet klaarkom? By die
Nasionale Museum in Bloemfontein, waar daar uitsonderlike navorsing,
byvoorbeeld op die gebied van die Karoo-paleontologie gedoen word, is 45
poste nie gevul nie.

Terwyl kunsteburokrate goeie salarisse, byvoordele, pensioene en mediese
fondse ontvang, ontvang gerekende uitvoerende kunstenaars geen vaste
inkomste, geen bystand met gesondheidsorg en geen voorsiening vir hul oudag
nie. Dit is ongelukkig 'n feit.

'n Mens sou ook kon vra waarom die depotbiblioteek in Grahamstad verlede
jaar leeggestaan het en waarom biblioteke landwyd in krisis verkeer. 'n
Mens hoor ook dat rare seëls van die Nasionale Argief by handelaars beland
en skilderye voete kry. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Mr Chairperson, I want to make an appeal to the chief
whips that this debate in future be placed on the Order Paper as the first
item on a Tuesday afternoon and hon members have just heard the reason for
this.

This Budget Vote deals with the soul of the nation and as such it deserves
much more prominence. Like Cinderella, the portfolio committee is tired of
always having to stand at the cold cinders of the week's proceedings and
the cold pumpkin which my poor colleague then wants to serve to us is
something we do not want to eat, because everyone knows that the DP/DA has
deliberately kept us in the dark about their activities. [Interjections.]

The soul of the nation is important enough, but it also deals with the
heart and the mind as well as the product of the nation. Now I have to add
immediately, since the 1995-96 financial year the budget for this post more
than doubled, something I would like to give credit to. One can argue about
how the departmental allocation is made, and I want to propose that we take
a thorough look at what ought to be priorities.
Is it for example justifiable that for a one-time gathering R5 million
should be spent while an important national institution such as the William
Humphreys Art Gallery should get by with R1,7 million for an entire year?
At the National Museum in Bloemfontein where exceptional research, for
example in the area of the Karoo paleontology, is being done, 45 posts have
not been filled.

While art bureaucrats receive good salaries, fringe benefits, pensions and
medical funds, esteemed performing artists receive no fixed income, no
support with health care and no provision for their old age. Unfortunately
this is a fact.

One could also ask why the depot library in Grahamstown stood empty last
year and why libraries nationwide are in crisis. One also hears that rare
stamps of the National Archives end up in the hands of dealers and that
paintings disappear.]

I know the Minister wants to educate, inform, delight and uplift South
Africans, and I want to congratulate him, his department and the Deputy
Minister of the very good initiatives and the very many great successes
they have achieved. But there is a perception that the Government on the
whole lacks an informed vision.

I would like to ask the Minister to take up with Government the matter of a
thorough assessment of the assets of the country. Whereas there are some
asset registers such as the one found, for example, in the Department of
Public Works, nationally - and at least in the Western Cape provincially -
many departments in all spheres of government share the custodianship of a
great variety of assets. Until this cataloguing is done, it will be
difficult for Government to gain a comprehensive overview of the extent and
condition of its inheritance.

Admittedly, this will be a vast task. The number of libraries, museums,
galleries, sites of scientific or historic importance, scientific and
technological institutes and installations, monuments, botanical gardens,
zoos, herbariums and archives, as well as the contents of the
aforementioned, is breathtaking. And I would like to take Mrs Njobe to show
her what there is of Africa that she could be proud of.

Add to this the intangible heritage such as languages, customs, skills and
knowledge and the mind boggles. Doubtless, much of these are under
utilised, therefore it does not seem sensible to proceed otherwise than
with caution on burdening the state with more material assets. Sustainable
use of existing assets is the crux. The same portion needs to apply in our
approach to our human resources at every front. We simply cannot afford to
lose more scarce skills. I think that Sansa is a very laudable initiative
and I wish the Minister great success with it.

Next, we need to arrive at key principles to Government policy after
following due process. We should start with home-grown expertise in
relevant fields, then we can start the process of reformulating policy with
the people working in these disciplines, participating fruitfully and
taking joint ownership of the product. Some of the present policies and
consequential legislation do not enjoy unquestionable credibility - and in
some cases even legitimacy - to meet the requirements of successful
administration and service delivery.

Hierna kan ons begin met die praktiese aspekte: herbeplanning, herbegroting
en uitvoering, want die ministerie se verpligtinge teenoor die nasie strek
veel wyer as net sy eie lynfunksie. In noue samewerking met ander
departemente, en veral provinsiale- en plaaslike beplanningsdepartemente,
behoort beleidsrigtinge van die hele Regering te verseker dat Suid-
Afrikaanse kultuur nie verder geërodeer word deur vlak en gewelddadige
elektroniese vermaak nie, die kuslyn van Suid-Afrika nie verder ontsier
word deur ongebreidelde uitbreiding van styllose en onvolhoubare
vakansiedorpontwikkeling nie en dat snelgroeiende behuisingsareas die
kragtige streeksontwerpe inheems aan Suid-Afrika reflekteer.

Suid-Afrika het probleme, maar ons het die talent en die bates wat ons
visioenêr kan aanwend. Dit is juis hierdie portefeulje wat die Afrika
Renaissance en Nepad kan laat werk. Hiermee wil die Nuwe NP die Minister
graag bystaan. Ons glo aan Suid-Afrika eerste, en ons wil van hom 'n
suksesland maak.

Ons steun hierdie begrotingspas. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[After this we can start with the practical aspects: replanning,
rebudgeting and export, because the Ministry's obligations towards the
nation stretches much wider than merely its own line function. In close co-
operation with other departments, and especially provincial and local
planning departments, policy trends of the entire Government ought to
ensure that South African cultures are no longer eroded by superficial and
violent electronic recreation, that the coastline of South Africa is no
longer defaced by the uncontrolled extension of unsustainable holiday town
development which is without style, and that fast-growing housing areas
reflect the powerful indigenous regional designs of South Africa.

South Africa has problems, but we have the talent and the assets which we
could apply in a visionary way. It is precisely this portfolio which can
make the African Renaissance and Nepad work. The New NP would like to
assist the Minister in this. We believe in South Africa first and we want
to make it a winning country.

We support this budget. [Applause.]]

Prof I J MOHAMED: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister and hon
members, it is a pleasure for me to support, on behalf of the ANC, the
Budget Vote of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. I
congratulate Mama Njobe on her appointment as chairperson of our portfolio
committee. I want to say to the hon Deputy Minister Brigitte Mabandla that
I very much appreciate the poem that she has read here about Saartjie
Baartman. It is deeply moving.

The department's activities are divided into five programmes:
Administration, Arts and Culture, the National Archives of South Africa,
the National Language Service and Science, Technology and Meta-information.
The latter programme creates the framework and strategy for the development
of science and technology. The department Budget Vote increased by 12,8% to
approximately R1,364 billion from the year 2001-02 to the year 2002-03.

I shall confine my comments to the Science, Technology and Meta-information
programme, which I shall abbreviate to Science and Technology and its
various subprogrammes. The share of this programme in the Budget Vote is
55,4%. This is down from 60,3% from the previous year, largely due to
increases in spending on Arts and Culture and National Language Service
programmes. There are no grounds for complaint about a bigger share for the
Arts and Culture or National Language Service programme, particularly as
the Science and Technology allocation grows by an average of nearly 10% per
year over the medium term. But, as I explained, the role of science and
technology, as hon members see, I believe, is very extensive and crucial,
and so this Budget Vote should be increased substantially.

The allocation to science and technology is approximately R755,9 million,
an increase of 9,7% on the previous year. This allocation is projected to
increase by 16,1% in 2003-04. Minister Ngubane and his department and the
director-general, of course, as well as the Deputy Minister, Ms Brigitte
Mabandla, must have convinced Government of the important role science and
technology play as driver of economic development and making our country a
credible competitor in the global market. I congratulate them.

The driving force of DACST's development and the programmes they have
implemented rest on the National System of Innovation. The department has
established a National Advisory Council on Innovation, NACI, to oversee the
innovation process and advise the Minister on various aspects of policy.
Before I get to the details of policy and the Budget Vote, I want to ask,
as required by the Public Finance Management Act, the PFMA, how the budget
of DACST responds to key Government policy issues. I can discuss just one
such issue.

The major problem confronting our country and Government is to bring the
poor and marginalised into the mainstream of the economy and society. To
resolve this problem requires rapid economic growth and hence the creation
of jobs. This problem was researched by Naci and I will summarise its
report because it has a direct bearing on our oversight function regarding
the Budget Vote. Members are urged to read the report for the details.

To give the poor access to this requires training and education, otherwise
they will not have skills to fill the jobs and skilled labour will have to
be imported, which will not solve the problem I stated. To develop the
economy we need competitive industries and products to create niche
markets, and this requires innovation. There has been a decline of real per
capita gross domestic product since 1970 and more rapidly since 1991. To
change this situation there is a need for major technological progress,
given the technological state of the global economy.

But what is the picture of this in our country? The Naci report shows that
technical progress to output growth in West Germany is 87%, in France and
the UK 78%, in Japan 59% and in the USA 50%, while in Africa it is 0% and
in the East Asia 28%. In South Africa in the 1970's it declined by 0,49%.
In the 1980's it was 0,34% and in the 1990's it was 1,07%.

Clearly there is a massive need for investment in human capital and
particularly in mathematics and science as drivers of technology, the
report shows, but there is a decline in the number of students who opt for
these subjects on the higher grade and so the technological fields are
closed to them.

To meet this problem we need to address it at schools. There will have to
be serious upgrading programmes for teachers, so that they are qualified to
train students in these fields. If this is not done, science and
mathematics higher grade teaching will continue to decline, and we shall
fail to meet the opening point that I have mentioned on the task of
Government to bring the poor and the marginalised into the mainstream.
These comments come, basically, from the NACI report. So, let us see how
the DACST budget tries to address this problem, while we know that very
much depends on education. As an aside, I leave it to the members to decide
if the restructuring of the schools and universities address this problem.

The science and technology programme is divided into four subprogrammes. I
shall briefly say something about each of the subprogrammes, its tasks and
achievements. The first subprogramme is called "Science, Technology and
Knowledge System Development and Maintenance." It is allocated R246 million
this year. In broad terms this subprogramme supports science and technology
policy formulation, creates working systems and instruments for
development.
It transfers technology and knowledge to various institutions. For example,
the creation of computer-controlled instruments that create vehicle
components and assemble these in the motor vehicle industry, as well as
train the workforce to operate such equipment.

Clearly, there must be human resource development and upgrading of staff.
Of course, jobs are lost at the lower levels and this must be addressed,
but the NACI report indicated what must be done. This subprogramme funds
the Innovation Fund with an allocation of R136,7 million this year; the
poverty relief programme with an allocation of R30 million last year, but
only R18 million this year; and the financial assistance projects with an
allocation of R74,5 million this year.

The Innovation Fund was created to focus on large-scale projects with a
significant research and development programme. The aim is to enhance the
efficiency of scientific and technology institutions, improve the quality
and quantity of science and technology skills, and produce advanced
production systems and products. For example, biologists, organic chemists
and gold mining engineers were brought together by Mintek to develop
bioleaching. This recovers gold from gold-bearing ore by biochemical means
rather than purely nonorganic chemical means, which uses dangerous
chemicals.

Bioleaching is similar to the process whereby microbes take nitrogen from
the air and fix it to the roots of plants to enable the plant to grow,
rather than taking the nitrogen from chemical fertilisers. This knowledge
would then also be brought to small-scale miners who use extensively
dangerous chemicals like mercury and cyanide. When the mercury is heated,
which the miners do, the vapours cause irreversible brain damage. Perhaps
members have also seen iron and steel produced in computer-controlled
furnaces and the conveyance of molten metals in large computer-controlled
bins.

Similarly, members may have seen straight steel rods being rolled out
between rollers shaped like power stations on cooling towers, of course, on
a smaller scale. These designs come from a mathematical programme. These
examples are meant to show members the importance of science and
mathematics.

This subprogramme also has a target to establish a bioinformatics resource
centre in 2002 to 2003. Another target is to establish the first
biotechnology centre of excellence. One of the lead programmes of the
department is in the area of biotechnology under which food production,
nutrition, medicines and health care, environmental applications and
industrial applications were studied.

This programme in particular has an important role to play in the Nepad
project. Subprogramme 2 is called "Support for Institutions active in
Science, Technology and Information Service Activities." The allocation for
this subprogramme is R457,7 million. This subprogramme funds the Human
Science Research Council, the HSRC, which receives R65,1 million in the
present year. The HSRC does sociological research - the Minister has
already alluded to this - for example school needs, the impact on
communities who live in very densely populated areas or survival strategies
of the unemployed and the poor. This subprogramme also funds the national
library for the blind and literature for the visually handicapped.

This also funds the National Research Foundation, NRF, which was allocated
R222,3 million this year. The NRF funds university bursaries as well as
research and our national facilities. The national facilities are top-rate
research institutions and include the Astronomical Observatory, the
Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomical Observatory, the SA Large Telescope and
the iThemba Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences. The latter produce
radiopotes for medical diagnostic purposes and treats cancer with its
nuclear particle beam that cannot be treated with the conventional cobalt
system. This treatment is also given to people from outside our borders and
is, therefore, another support for Nepad.

The SA Large Telescope, SALT, along with other observatories, will obtain
information about our galaxy, ie the Milky Way, and thus make a
contribution to international science. Remember that our galaxy is a spiral
galaxy which extends over a distance which takes a ray of light 100 000
years to travel from one end of the diameter of a galaxy to the other.
Remember the excitement and inspiration your children and my grandchildren
will have when they visit these sites and experience the marvels of the
universe, and of science and technology. Some day we will run out of
industrial minerals we now mine. We will then have to use the knowledge we
have gained from these observations to bring these materials from other
planets into our solar system.

Subprogrammes 3 is called "Science and Society." We are basically trying to
increase the interest of the community in science and technology, to try
and get students to study mathematics and science. I will not extend more
on that because of time, but the Deputy Minister has already expounded on
that.

Subprogramme 4 is ``Technology Development.'' It identifies key
technologies and hence gives direction to the sectors information
technology, biotechnology and advanced materials.

I just want to remind hon members that physicists have discovered and
advanced material, a very high conductor of heat. If research can bring the
cost of that material down it will resolve the problem of solar energy in
the rural areas. This, too, is in support of Nepad. I pay tribute to Dr
Stobie of the Astronomical Observatory for the work he has done,
particularly on SALT, and I express my condolences to his family on his
recent death.

Finally, I which to tell DACST that it is doing well. It has reported, as
required by the PFMA, but should please give us some more measurable
outputs. It should also not spread its information so that we must hunt for
it. I hope Minister Ngubane, his department and the director-general will
manage to convince Government that their work deserves more than what they
are allocated. I wish them well. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister Ngubane en agb
adjunkminister Mabandla, Europa was nie altyd so welvarend en op die
voorpunt van tegnologiese ontwikkeling soos vandag nie. Baie eeue lank
tydens die donker Middeleeue was Europa in 'n intellektuele duisternis
gehul.

Die vraag is: Waarom het Europa ná die Renaissance so vooruitgegaan en
ontwikkel? Baie redes kan aangevoer word, maar historici stel dit dat een
van die belangrikste redes die feit is dat die opvoeding in Europa na die
Renaissance in die mense se spreektale plaasgevind en nie meer in die hoë
statustaal van daardie tyd, naamlik Latyn nie. Nou praat pres Mbeki van 'n
Afirka Renaissance en Nepad waarmee Afrika opgebou moet word. Die VF steun
sy Nepakinisiatief, maar glo 'n belangrike voorwaarde is dat die
Afrikaspreektale meer na vore moet kom in die plek van die koloniale tale
soos Frans en Engels.

Die Minister van Kuns, Kultuur, Wetenskap en Tegnologie is onder andere
belas met die belangrike taak om die Grondwet se artikel oor taal te help
uitvoer. Artikel 6(2) van die Grondwet stel dit dat die staat praktiese en
daadwerklike maatreëls moet tref om die status van dié tale te verhoog en
hul gebruik te bevorder. Sou ons nie die status van die inheemse tale
verhef het deur ook byvoorbeeld Zoeloe- of Sothonaamborde by die Parlement
aan te bring nie? Dit lyk of die ANC-regering skaam is vir hierdie tale en
daarom net Engels op al die naamborde gebruik.

Tot op hede is die saak nog nie reggestel nie en die Minister en sy
departement moet daarmee help, aangesien dit ook hulle taak is om na die
tale van Suid-Afrika te kyk. Die VF het 'n klagte by PanSAT  daaroor gelê
en vertrou dat hulle die onreg teenoor ander Suid-Afrikaanse tale by die
Parlement sal insien. PanSAT sit egter met meer as 200 agterstallige sake.
Dit is in hierdie Minister se vermoë om PanSAT sterker te maak, nie net ten
opsigte van sy begroting en personeel nie, maar ook om daaraan werklike
wetlike tande te gee. Staatsdepartemente soos die Departement van Openbare
Werke is deur PanSAT skuldig bevind dat hulle die Grondwet skend ten
opsigte van sy taalbeleid. Tog ignoreer die betrokke departement die
skuldigbevinding. As die beoogde taalwetgewing van die Minister al
deurgevoer was, sou ons die meeste van die probleme in die departemente en
die Parlement kon voorkom het. Waarom is die taalwet nog steeds nie
deurgevoer nie? Is dit nog 'n IVP-Minister wat deur die ANC gesaboteer word
en dan moet hierdie Raad die probleme namens die ANC hanteer?

Prof Albert Weideman van die Eenheid vir die Ontwikkeling van
Taalvaardigheid aan die UP het onlangs bevind dat daar 'n sterk afname in
taalvaardigheid onder Suid-Afrikaanse studente is. Die keuse van Suid-
Afrikaanse ouers is om hulle kinders in 'n hoëstatustaal soos Engels op te
voed en dit is besig om tot 'n tragiese afname in taalgeletterdheid en
taalvaardigheid te lei. Dit geld nie net vir swart sprekers vir wie Engels
'n tweede of 'n derde taal is nie, maar ook ander sprekers vir wie Engels
ook 'n tweede of 'n derde taal is.

Hierdie Minister en sy departement het 'n belangrike taak om te help dat
Nepad en die Afrika Renaissance slaag deur Afrikamense hul trots op hul
tale terug te gee. Die VF help hom graag daarmee. Ons steun die departement
se werk. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairman, hon Minister Ngubane and hon Deputy Minister
Mabandla, Europe was not always as prosperous and at the forefront of
technological development as is the case today. For many centuries during
the dark Middle Ages Europe was wrapped in intellectual darkness.

The question is: Why did Europe prosper and develop so much after the
Renaissance? Many reasons can be given, but historians give as one of the
most important reasons the fact that education in Europe following the
Renaissance took place in the people's spoken languages and no longer in
the high-status language of that time, namely Latin. Now President Mbeki is
talking about an African Renaissance and Nepad, by way of which Africa must
be built up. The FF supports his Nepad initiative, but believes an
important condition is that the spoken African languages should come to the
fore more strongly in the place of colonial languages like French and
English.

The Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology is, inter alia,
tasked with the important task to help execute the Constitution's section
on language. Section 6(2) of the Constitution states that the state must
take practical and positive measures to elevate the status and advance the
use of these languages. Would we not have elevated the status of the
indigenous languages by also, for example, adding Zulu or Sotho signposts
at Parliament? It looks as though the ANC Government is ashamed of these
languages and therefore only uses English on all the signposts.

To date the matter has still not been rectified and the Minister and his
department must help in this regard, as it is also their task to see to the
languages of South Africa. The FF laid a complaint with PanSALB about the
matter and trusts that they will recognise the injustice towards other
South African languages at Parliament. However, PanSALB is more than 200
cases in arrears. It is within this Minister's power to strengthen PanSALB,
not only with regard to its budget and staff, but also to give it real
statutory teeth. Government departments like the Department of Public Works
have been found guilty by PanSALB of violating the Constitution with regard
to their language policy. And yet the relevant department ignores the
conviction. If the Minister's envisaged language legislation had already
been passed, we would have been able to prevent most of the problems in the
departments and at Parliament. Why has the language Act still not been
passed? Is it that another IFP Minister has been sabotaged by the ANC and
then this House must deal with the problems on behalf of the ANC?

Prof Albert Weideman from the Unit for Language Skills Development at the
University of Pretoria recently found that there has been a sharp decline
in language skills among South African students. The choice of South
African parents is to educate their children in a high-status language like
English and this is leading to a tragic decline in language literacy and
language skills. This applies not only to black speakers for whom English
is a second or third language, but also among other speakers for whom
English is also a second or third language.

This Minister and his department have an important task to help Nepad and
the Africa Renaissance succeed by returning to African people their pride
in their languages. The FF would be glad to help him with that. We support
the department's work. [Time expired.]]

[Ms M A SEECO: Chairperson, with this department of infrastructure, that
is, the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, South Africa
confirms that it uses this Budget towards the performers and it also proves
itself by taking part in the film industry, even abroad. Cultural centres
should be assisted with funds to encourage our future generation. I am
talking about cultural songs and art that should be sent abroad. Art
entails things such as speech, writing, style of clothing, sculpting with
stone or wood, sculpting with clay and knitting.

This department improves the knowledge that our people have to earn a
living. The UCDP accepts this Budget.]

The UCDP considers the budget of this department as realising the potential
of the arts, culture, science and technology in social and economic
development. The ongoing transformation of the department into an
organisation that promotes lifelong learning for all South Africans is a
prerequisite for fulfilling key Government objectives.

Congratulations to Dr Ben Ngubane, who is the chairman of the Commonwealth
Science Council for the triennium 2000-2003. South Africa will host the
21st meeting of the Commonwealth Science Council in 2003.

The bulk of the spending on administration goes towards the personnel
expenditure at approximately 66%.

We appreciate the process and initiatives that have been undertaken by the
department over the past two years, namely the South African Music Week;
exporting craft work to Burkina Faso and celebrating South Africa in
London. The music industry task team process, which lays the foundation for
the development of an export council in the cultural industry ... [Time

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, hon Minister, the Department of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology distributes the funds allocated for
research to the different research councils. The funds made available to
the Agricultural Research Council amount to R265 million. This amount, in
real terms, is equivalent to only 55% of what the ARC received in 1992.

During the last couple of years the funds allocated to the Agricultural
Research Council were decreased year by year, from an amount of
R337 million in 1997-98 to R262 million in the year 2001-02. This had
catastrophic effects on the ARC because the projected amount for the year
2002 was in the vicinity R600 million. This decline is leading to the
downfall of the ARC, which is the cornerstone of agriculture and
agricultural development in southern Africa.

The agricultural research ship is sinking. Many promising research projects
are abandoned. A total of 62 key researchers left the ARC this year for
jobs outside this company and in the private sector. More than 93 critical
posts remain vacant. Many institutes, the Onderstepoort Veterinary
Institute, for instance, are in crisis owing to the lack of funds and
resignation of personnel. I can go on, and on and on.

While the funds of the ARC decline each year, those of the Medical Research
Council and other research councils have increased by 30%, and those of the
Bureau of Standards by 61%. This indicates to the agricultural sector that
the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology does not consider
agricultural research as very important and gives it a low priority.

I would say that reconsideration of this stance is absolutely necessary.
And if funds are not made available and we do not look at this important
infrastructure, which we cannot do without, I can forecast now that in the
next two to three years agricultural research will disappear and food will,
eventually, have to be imported into South Africa.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I call upon the hon L L L Chiwayo,
who is going to make his maiden speech, to address the House.

Hon MEMBERS: Hear! Hear! [Applause.]
Mr L L L CHIWAYO: Chairperson, lend me your ear, lend me your ear. I am
told that this is a popular phrase that is contained in most of
Shakespeare's books, but I was advised that if I was to employ its usage I
should exercise extreme care and caution that there are not the likes of
Mike Tyson in the audience, who might give a literal meaning to that
phrase. [Laughter.]

I had an exciting experience about two days ago. I met a young man from the
North West. His name is Given and his surname I have forgotten. He is
twenty years old. He is in his second year of study at one of the colleges
in Cape Town. He approached me and told me that he was quite proud that
there are those who are young-looking, like ourselves, who are part of this
House. [Laughter.] Somebody has just added ``good looking'', and I am sure
there are many other judges who might confirm that. [Laughter.]

He went on and said that he wished to be part of this House one day and
that he wanted to serve his people and follow in the example of many
leaders, current and former leaders, such as our former president Nelson
Mandela. For me it was quite exciting that young people could have that
sense of commitment and see the significance of this House, especially in
relation to impacting on the lives of our people out there.

I sat back that evening and reflected on that matter. I could not help but
be preoccupied with our own experiences and other things might have brought
about the experience of coming to this House. I thought about the fact that
he was 22 years old, and not particularly active in student activities. By
the way, one piece of advice that I gave him was that he should start
engaging in activities that would show his peers that he does indeed care
about our people, and primarily to focus on issues that affect not only his
sector but those around him.

I was interpreting the implications of that on his career and any
possibility of him serving in such a House. I could not help but think that
he would have to gain 10 years, of experience before he could make it to
this House. In other words, he might, depending on how he fared, find
himself in this House within the next 10 years when he would be only 32.

That makes one realise just how one is humbled and honoured to find oneself
serving in this House, and on that basis, I want to take this opportunity
to thank the ANC for having shortened that period, because some of us had
the honour and the humbling experience of serving in the legislative
assemblies, especially in the Senate, at the age of 25. [Applause.]

I want to thank our people and their struggle, because that made us what we
are. That struggle made us comprehend the harsh realities of the situations
that we were faced with at an early age, to the extent that we realised
that those harsh conditions were not created by God, but were man-made and,
since they were man-made, it would take human effort to change those
conditions, and not prayer only.

Having related that experience, which was a very disappointing one, I want
to mention a phone-in programme that was hosted by DJ Khabzela on Y-FM. One
of the young people said - I want to repeat what he said - that:


  We are tired of these exiles. We are tired of the former prisoners. We
  are tired of the politicians. We want to be led by somebody we can relate
  to.

It was rather disappointing that a young person, who I thought was between
the ages of 15 and 22, had such a short memory, a memory that displayed the
ignorance that might be creeping into the minds of many young people like
him out there, who might not be able to interpret and relate the exciting
experiences of the transformation process that is unfolding in our country
to the sacrifices and struggles that were waged by our people, including by
the very politicians he was talking about, and the exiles and prisoners.

I felt terribly disappointed, not because I also happen to be a former
Robben Island prisoner and therefore, that if indeed many of them think in
that manner, then chances of any exile making it to any serious leadership
position in government would be limited. That was not particularly my
worry. My worry was the fact that we do not seem to have a memory bank
which young people could tap into to come to terms with the realities of
our history, to come to terms with, most importantly, those things that are
critical in making us the winning nation that we are.

Many people would ask: Why these stories and what relevance do they have to
the debate at hand? The latter example of the disappointing youngster
inevitably means that if one confronts each one of them and asks them who
their role models are, they are likely to identify instant millionaires
who, in a split second, rob a bank and make themselves important members of
society because they have accumulated riches. I also think that some of the
role models that they might identify are those who continuously spin cars
in the townships. They might also see them as people they could look up to.

I do think, with a sigh of relief, that, if confronted again, that person
is also likely to identify artists. He is likely to talk about Mandoza,
Arthur Mafokate and Hugh Masikela. That person is likely to talk about the
many actors that we have seen on TV because, at least, those are some of
the things that are quite important in occupying this vacuum of a lack of
role models that we can promote in society and that young people can look
up to. I think that this invariably indicates the significance of the arts
as a terrain of not only raising a profile of individuals among societies,
but also, most importantly, as a possible platform that can clearly develop
role models that we can always look up to.

Regarding the issue I raised of a young person who is completely ignorant,
I think the important question that we must ask ourselves as members - I am
sure all of us would be disappointed if the memories of this exciting
experiences were to be forgotten in a short space of time - is: what can we
do to change the situation?

One of my responses would be that we have to be determined to free the
arts, culture and heritage from the intensive care unit in which they have
historically languished and continue to languish today. I am deliberately
raising this point, and I hope the hon members I spoke to about this will
not feel embarrassed.

When I decided to serve on the Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology, many of my colleagues asked me why I was wasting my
time there, when there were more important committees I could serve on, for
example communications, finance and a whole range of others. ``That is the
committee of people who really do not want to have their energies
engaged'', one of the views went. Unfortunately, it is exactly this
perception, in my view, that might be dictating the very figures that we
normally see when talking about arts, culture, science and technology,
because in a way it is a function that finds itself relegated to the
periphery of social development, because people think that it is something
that is not important.

Historically, it has found itself as a function moving between functions.
It was part of education, treated like a step-daughter or step-child. It
found itself in some provinces, for instance, as part of welfare. The only
relationship I can think of among sports, recreation, arts, culture and
welfare is that if one is a member of the Health and Racquet Club, it
attends to one's welfare or lifestyle. I cannot see any other relationship
whatsoever.

The point I am trying to make is that unless we recognise the significance
of this function, especially in a manner that speaks to the figures, ie the
budgetary issues that we are talking about today, we will not impact on the
perceptions of young people out there. Arts, culture and heritage are not
about playing and sweating, it is serious business. It is a serious
business because any nation that wants its existence to be known primarily
relies on this very important area of life to communicate any important
message about its existence.

It is not an accident that the aesthetic value that we as South Africans
attach to music would tilt more in favour of American music as opposed to
our own, because of the significant attention which those musicians are
given in their own countries. A Michael Jackson would be as important as a
Bill Gates in America, unlike an artist who will die and be buried a pauper
in South Africa. So those are some of the things that one wishes to raise
as means of drawing a parallel.

As a nation of information, there are important issues that we always have
to confront, such as issues of identity, which are about a sense of
national unity, as well as issues of common belonging, unity, solidarity
and patriotism.
This brings us to a very important question: What can we do to ensure that,
indeed, South Africa becomes a common nation and a winning nation? There
are a number of important debates that we have been engaged in, including
the one about attempts to define what makes a nation. There are different
perspectives in regard to characteristics that might make a nation, but
there is common understanding around issues such as common national
boundaries, a common economy, a shared culture, and so forth.

I think that alone indicates the significance of culture as something that
can help in building a nation. When talking about culture, there are both
tangible and intangible aspects that we can talk about. For instance, there
are issues of norms and values. What distinguishes members of the animal
kingdom, ie us as human beings from dogs, is the fact that we have norms
and values that we subscribe to or norms and values that guide our conduct
and behavioural standards, as opposed to dogs, which can engage in all
manner of practices that we would refer to as antisocial behaviour.

Arts and culture can play an important role in fostering a sense of
community spirit, of solidarity. The fact that people are up in arms, for
instance, over a TV programme that shows somebody who deals in human parts
is because people are concerned and have the sense of patriotism that we
are supposed to have towards the next human being. Most importantly, this
ensures that antisocial activity is completely gotten rid of in society.
That is where arts and culture can play a role - in issues of solidarity,
as I said, and patriotism.

However, arts and culture can also play an important role in fostering a
sense of tolerance. It is sometimes shocking to those of us who have had
... [Time expired.][Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, die belangrikste instrumente tot die
bewaring van 'n kulturele erfenis, wat ons Minister se verantwoordelikheid
is, is nie dooie standbeelde en museums nie, maar lewende monumente, die
name van ons dorpe en stede, berge en riviere. Oor die kwessie van plekname
in Suid-Afrika oefen hierdie Minister sy bevoegdheid uit kragtens wet 118
van 1998 en met behulp van 'n statutêre liggaam, die Suid-Afrikaanse
Pleknaamraad. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairman, the most important instruments in the
conservation of a cultural heritage, which is our Minister's
responsibility, are not dead statues and museums, but living monuments, the
names of our towns and cities, mountains and rivers. The Minister exercises
his competence on the issue of place names in South Africa in terms of Act
118 of 1998, assisted by a statutory body, the South African Geographical
Names Council.]

According to this Act, this council has certain duties, inter alia, to
facilitate the establishment of provincial geographical names committees;
to set guidelines for these committees and for local and provincial
authorities; to liaise with cultural, historic and linguistic
organisations, to identify names in need of revision, in consultation with
provincial governments.

In die Minister se toespraak by die opening van die Pleknaamraad op 8
Desember 1999 het hy getoon dat hy begrip het vir die kompleksiteit van
hierdie probleem en vir die kulturele sensitiwiteit daarvan. Die Minister
het hom soos volg uitgelaat: (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In the Minister's speech at the inauguration of the Geographical Names
Council on 8 December 1999 he displayed his understanding of the complexity
of this problem and its cultural sensitivity. The Minister expressed
himself as follows:]


  We all know too well how naming can be used to divide and segregate a
  country ... I hope that the establishment of this council will pave the
  way for the constructive use of names, to show our diversity, our vibrant
  multicultural history and experiences of our many people.

The Minister then stressed the need for place-name contexts to be
representative of the country's many peoples, languages and cultures.

Mooi woorde - en ons stem saam met die Minister, maar wat gebeur egter? In
een enkele Nag van die Lang Messe word feitlik elke dorpsnaam in die
Noordelike Provinsie, van Warmbad tot Messina, van Ellisras tot
Duiwelskloof, verander. [Fine words - and we agree with the Minister, but
what has happened? On a single Night of the Long Knives the names of
practically every town in the Northern Province, from Warmbaths to Messina,
from Ellisras to Duiwelskloof, have been changed.]

... an action that makes a mockery of the famous words of the Freedom
Charter that ``South Africa belongs to all its people''.

'n Gebeurtenis wat soos min ander ooit simbolies vir veral Afrikaners sê:
Dis nie julle plek hierdie nie. Die gevolg hiervan is vervreemding,
verwydering en verset.

Ek wil die Minister enkele vrae vra wat ek hoop hy vandag kan antwoord. Is
daar 'n provinsiale pleknaamkomitee in die Noordelike Provinsie ingestel?
Is daar vooraf met alle gemeenskappe gekonsulteer? Is daar riglyne neergelê
vir die provinsiale owerheid? Is die rits dorpname wat meteens verander is
wel na oorlegpleging met die Suid-Afrikaanse Pleknaamraad geïdentifiseer en
verander, soos deur die wet vereis? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[An event which, like few others before, has symbolically told the
Afrikaner in particular: This place is not yours. This has brought about
estrangement, separation and resistance.

I want to ask the Minister a few questions which I hope he can answer
today. Was a provincial geographical names committee appointed in the
Northern Province? Were all communities consulted beforehand? Were
guidelines established for the provincial authority? Was the whole series
of names of towns that were summarily changed actually identified and
changed after consultation with the SA Geographical Names Council, as
required by law?]

Furthermore, is the Minister of the opinion that this conduct in the
Northern Province will pave the way for the constructive use of names, as
the Minister promised in his speech? Does the Minister think that the end
result of this bulldozing exercise in the Northern Province will show our
diversity and our multicultural history? Will the names in this province
and eventually in South Africa be representative of the country's many
peoples, as the Minister promised? Is the Minister of the opinion that the
statement of the chairperson of the SA Geographical Names Council, Prof
Mathenjwa, in the only published annual report of 31 March 2001, is in
accordance with the objectives of the law, when he said: ``South Africa
should move fast, like its neighbouring countries that moved fast to remove
anything that reminded them of the colonial and oppressive years''?
Anything! A clean sweep! A total onslaught.

Die finale beslissing is in die hande van die Minister. Hy sal eersdaags sy
stempel moet plaas op hierdie daad van kulturele imperialisme. Gaan hy dit
doen? Of gaan hy hom laat lei deur die riglyne wat hy self gestel het in
daardie goeie toespraak wat hy gemaak het? Die AEB doen 'n beroep op die
Minister, aangesien in talle opsigte afgewyk is van die neergelegde beleid,
selfs in die norme van die wet. Die proses is gekenmerk deur 'n gebrek aan
konsultasie van gemeenskappe. Ons wil vir die Minister sê: Stop die bus!
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The final decision is in the hands of the Minister. Before long he will
have to put his stamp on this deed of cultural imperialism. Will he do it?
Or will he be led by the guidelines that he himself established in that
great speech of his? The AEB is making an appeal to the Minister, because
the established policy has been contravened in many respects, even in the
norms of the law. The process has been characterised by a lack of
consultation with communities. We want to tell the Minister: Stop the bus!]

He must get the communities together; let all the interests be put on the
table; let South Africans in their diversity deliberate together and work
towards a solution together. There must be a way in which we can solve this
problem together. The present alternative is one of alienation, to the
detriment of loyalty, patriotism and harmony, and, finally, to the
detriment of all the peoples in South Africa.

Ons wag in spanning om te sien wat die agb Minister oor hierdie saak gaan
doen. [We are waiting in suspense to see what the hon the Minister is going
to do about this matter.]
Mr V C GORE: Chairperson, the DA listened to and laments with the hon Njobe
over her humiliating and degrading experience at the Cango Caves. However,
I would like to take this opportunity to remind the hon Njobe and the ANC
that the reason for her distress was none other than her new political
bedfellow, the New NP.

When Mark Shuttleworth launched into space and travelled to the
International Space Station during April 2002, he not only became the first
``Afronaught'', but, more importantly, he ignited the imagination of
thousands of South Africans. It is now groovy to be a geek, trendy to be a
nerd and downright cool to be smart. Science and technology are no longer
in the domain of the supernerd, as it is now hip to be square.

Due to time constraints, it is extremely difficult to highlight the
achievements of this department, and there are many. The DA congratulates
the Minister on these. I would, however, like to concentrate on a few key
issues.

Perhaps the Minister would like to respond to the embarrassing situation
his department finds itself in. On the one side of the House, the hon
President in his opening-of-Parliament address announced that Microsoft
would be donating software to 32 000 schools. On the other side of the
House, we have the National Advisory Council on Innovation, established in
terms of legislation to advise the Minister and Cabinet on scientific
matters, advocating the adoption of open-source software, such as Linux, as
the most appropriate manner for addressing the digital divide. This is in
direct opposition to the President's actions to make use of proprietary
software such as that of Microsoft. Is this conflict a result of
miscommunication or does it highlight the growing political divide between
the IFP and the ANC?

African and South African problems are unique, and therefore require unique
solutions. We need South Africans to find ways to pump water to the top of
the Maluti Mountains, to electrify Eshowe and to supply telephones to
Toekomsrus.

It is therefore distressing to note the continued R&D spending as a
percentage of GDP remaining at an unacceptably low level compared to that
of other countries. If we as South Africans are going to find solutions to
the myriad of problems that face this country, more money has to be spent
on research and development. I encourage the Minister to address this
serious situation.

In addition, if one takes a walk through the labs and research facilities
of our country, one of the first things one will notice is the shortage of
young people doing research. Research, by its very nature, requires fresh
and supple minds to come up with innovative answers. An alarm bell is
ringing; either the hon Minister reverse the flow of our top young minds
overseas and encourage them to stay, or South Africa faces the real risk
that we will not be able to do any meaningful research in a few years'
time.

When we look at Mark Shuttleworth and his billions, we generally see the
exception rather than the rule. This fairy tale needs to become the rule,
rather than the exception. All South Africans have to embrace the
entrepreneurial flair of Shuttleworth - with high risk comes high reward.

The DA fully supports the initiatives of the department in its promotion of
the entrepreneur through SMME development, particularly through projects
such as the MAC centres, Brain and Godisa. However, the DA would like to
see a few things go a bit further.

First of all, there must be easier access to start-up funding; the cost of
business must be reduced; must be encouraged; more industry research
institution cross-pollination and, finally, there must be tax incentives
for technology-based research.

If South Africa continues to promote science and technology and accelerates
support in innovation, then we will see thousands of Shuttleworths blasting
off on a daily basis in search of brave new worlds. [Applause.]

Ms S D MOTUBATSE: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, the ANC
supports this budget allocation for 2002-03. The reason for that is that we
heard our people in 1955 when they spoke in Kliptown. All of us heard our
people saying: The doors of learning and culture shall be opened. They said
this in many languages: ``Minango ya pfunzo na mvelele i do vulwa'';
``Amathuba okufunda namasiko ayovulelwa wonke umuntu''; ``Die deure van
geleerdheid en kultuur sal oopgemaak word''.

[As the ANC we support this Budget Vote because we have promised to work
for the people. We hope that the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology will use this money for the good of the people. One of the
things that they promised they would do was to ensure that the budget was
used for the development of communities, so that they could show their
skills, abilities and capabilities.

We have realised that the department has a duty to support those who have
skills in arts and culture, so that they may be helped out of the poverty
in which they are submerged. Our Government must support these people, for
they voted us into power.

Our country is very rich. Its wealth is different from other countries'
because it includes knowledge, culture and skills. That is why we are
saying that the department should support our people so that this heritage
and these skills may be known worldwide.

When we come to the issue of languages, as the ANC and as the Department of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, we ensured that the Pan-South
African Language Board was established. It has a huge task. It has to
ensure that our languages are developed. This department, too, has to
ensure that our languages are elevated to the same level as other
languages. There should not be any single language which is looked down
upon. The board has to ensure that all languages are supported and
promoted. Even in this House we must make sure that languages are
respected. [Applause.]

We have many languages, but there is no one language which is above others.
This House must ensure that all speeches and documents in Parliament are
translated into other languages, and that these languages are further
developed.

When we come to the issue of writing, our languages must be superb, so that
they are accepted by the communities. I would like to thank the Minister
because I have realised that, in an effort to transform the department, he
put aside enough money so that after Cabinet had accepted his proposition,
he would have the money to carry out those ideas. This is the way in which
we have to work.

Chairperson, we also have to revisit the way in which we work with our
communities. As leaders, we have to do the things that we have promised we
will do. I would like to make an example by citing two musicians that I
respect very much. They are the late Mpharanyana and Vusi. Mpharanyana came
from the Free State and he could sing marvelously. In KwaZulu-Natal there
is Vusi. If one listens to his music, one is able to know what happens in
rural areas, like much of KwaZulu-Natal, with regard to issues such as
eating meat, because this man talks about how greedy he is and, amazingly,
how he likes to be bailed out by other people. He even says that no matter
how bad his health might be, if there were meat, he would go out and eat.
He says he would not even go to hospital. [Laughter.] These are the things
which we know are happening - circumstances that we find ourselves in. It
is because of our culture that we get to know about them.

I remember that in 1975 Mpharanyana, whom I have said I liked, sang a
certain song. So, one day in 1975 we went to Edgars stores. It is amazing
how many black people are purchasing things from this store. Back then it
was not their policy for black people to open an account with them. Black
people were forced to buy for cash. When things started to become better in
the country and black people were allowed to open accounts, we were
shocked, because we could not contemplate how we could be allowed to take
things from a shop without parting with our money. How could one be happy
using other people's things without paying for them? Then Mpharanyana
composed a song titled `` Ke yo Puleng, o di ragela pele le morago [Here is
Puleng, he is at sixes and sevens]. He sang about a lady who saw Puleng and
liked him because of the beautiful clothes he wore, not knowing that he
owed all these shops and a number of people. [Applause.] [Laughter.]

This is how our people could tell about their circumstances and problems in
life. Therefore, I would like to urge the Minister to continue supporting
our people so that skills such as the ones I talked about could come to the
fore.

I would like to deviate a bit and turn to the hon Opperman. I am quite sure
that all of us know that we have a culture brought about by those who
colonised us. The hon the Minister will bear with me, because I cannot
understand how opera and ballet could be held in high esteem compared to
other things in our own country. I know that there are people who listen to
this kind of music, but how many are they to warrant that money should be
thrown in their direction?

I am quite sure that if we could look after our musicians, then we would go
forward as a nation. I just want to cite one example for the hon the
Minister before I sit down. There is a town around Mashishing, in
Mpumalanga, called the great Mashishing, that is when we praise the town.
There are a number of trees planted in that area. Some of these trees are
very beautiful if one looks at them from afar, but when one comes nearer,
one finds they are not as beautiful as they were when one was far away, and
that there is no grass under these trees. When one looks closely at these
trees, one realises that they absorb quite a substantial volume of water
and, as a result, do not allow any plants whatsoever to grow under them.
However, these are wild trees which are very beautiful, and birds like to
build their nests in them.

Music is exactly the same. There are some types of music that we import
from the outside world, and they do not build our nation. Yet there is one
that, if we could put our money into it, would help develop our people, and
also help our children to know their cultures so they could be kept off the
streets. [Applause.]

In conclusion, I would like to turn to English, because I want the hon the
Minister to understand me.]

There is so much that the department is doing. I think the Department of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology is one of the best departments.
[Applause.] That is in spite of the huge tasks confronting the Minister and
the Deputy Minister. To monitor 48 state institutions is not child's play,
but I want to ask a question. I do not know what the Minister and the
Deputy Minister have done to the gentlemen and ladies of the press, because
we do not see this work being captured by the media. We do not hear much
said about all these good things that are happening. Maybe the hon the
Minister could respond to that?

Lastly, as a committee, we do not want to see a roll-over in this
department because we believe that the community centres that are out there
in the townships and the villages can absorb the department's budget and
definitely ensure that our people find meaning in their lives and can
remember where they come from and shape their destiny. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson, I would
like to thank the last hon member to speak here for recognising the
wonderful work that my colleague Mrs Mabandla and I are trying to do, in
partnership with the director-general, Dr Rob Adam, who heads the
department.

Well, quite clearly, the press write stories to sell their newspapers, not
to sing the praises of the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology and the Deputy Minister. So we will hope to impress the
wonderful work that we are doing upon the press and make them turn it into
stories that excite the country to be more creative and original and
therefore to work very hard to attain excellence, because one cannot be a
great scientist, researcher or dancer unless one works very, very hard to
sharpen one's skills and attain excellence. [Applause.]

There are issues that have been raised here. I would just like to briefly
say that because of the transformation of the performing arts councils into
playhouses that we have carried out, we have managed to save a lot of money
to give directly to performing arts companies of national significance.
Through the restructuring of the State Theatre, we were able to save R10
million, which was allocated to performing arts companies of national
significance. We see the evidence of this. Cats at the State Theatre is
playing to packed audiences week after week. We have seen it at Artscape
and at the Civic. New performances are coming through because the arts
companies are getting money directly from us, not as before, when they had
to depend on the boards of performing arts councils. We have actually
rescued the situation rather than made it worse.

We are also attending this year to more companies, covering as many genres
as possible. We want to cover everything from traditional operas, as we saw
with Princess Magogo KaDinizulu in Durban, to very, very classical ballet,
such as Swan Lake, because these are part of our heritage. Our children
must be able to perform any of these. That is why we have established a
music and dance troupe, so that we can capture all the dances. Whether
Volkspele or Khoisan dance, we will capture it in a group that is capable
of presenting this rich heritage, not just for us, but right across the
world. Those things are happening and we are increasing the money that we
are giving directly to arts companies to R20 million and not channelling it
via the playhouses as before. [Applause.]

We are also very much involved with issues other than classical music. We
are looking at the classical values that make this nation survive and be
great.

We know that religion and family values teach children respect for the law
and parents teach them life skills so that they can survive pressures from
their peers, particularly when it comes to sexual activity. We are
attending to all these things. We organised and launched the moral
regeneration conference this year. We are carrying on, working with groups
such as Focus on the Family in Durban to create documentation and training
programmes to be supplied to students, so that they can be able to stand
up, protect themselves and take their own well thought-out decisions.

Another issue that was raised which is of concern to us is the naming of
places. The hon Aucamp is quite correct; we cannot just be legalistic and
mechanistic in the allocation of new names or name changes. We have to go
deeper than that. We have to look at the process by which a new name is
adopted, but we must also look at the issue of equity, of justice and of
balance. We do not want to create polarised societies in this country. We
are interested in the culture of the nation. We must be the ones who build
the type of value system that makes for accommodation, tolerance and
understanding.

As far as agriculture is concerned I would like to correct the hon Van
Niekerk. We are very concerned about the state of affairs at the
Agricultural Research Council. The problems came in 1994 when huge areas of
transformation were made by the previous government, where they hived off
people into different research institutes for agriculture without
accompanying financial transfers. We sit in the ARC with huge unpaid leave
entitlements that make that institution unattractive to top scientists and
researchers. We are, however, dealing with this issue with the Minster of
Agriculture.

As far as PanSALB is concerned, ie the one-sidedness of the language
service, we are attending to this. We are finalising the issue of the Bill
with Cabinet. We are dealing with education, which is now the only area
that is unresolved, with the Minister. But we are working with the Minister
so that we can get the language Bill before this Parliament. We are
obviously going to have to look at some options that will be acceptable to
my Cabinet colleagues. What we came with after the language plan task team
concluded their recommendation was very comprehensive. However, some people
have thought there should be additional changes and modifications. We are
looking at this to provide sufficient options that will still carry out the
injunction of the Constitution to be equitable in language, but at the same
time addressing the realities that we face.

As far as Mr Gore is concerned, ie on the issue of Microsoft, we are very
grateful to Mr Bill Gates for making this donation. We are absolutely
appreciative. However, as we plan to create an advanced institute for ICTs
in the country, we need to create a platform over and above what the
universities and technikons provide, so that we have an institute like
Caltek and many other institutes in different countries that specialise in
expertise, research and development which is above that which is normally
seen in university teaching and research.

So for this reason we will need to develop open-source software, because we
have to develop our industries through the Internet or through the open-
source networks. No country can do this through proprietary technology
because it has licence conditions that limit what one can do. It was in
this spirit that the National Advisory Council on Innovation proposed that
Cabinet adopt an approach that includes open-source software as a strategic
issue in our research and development strategy.

On the whole I want to say that the debate has been very encouraging. We
are very grateful that hon members see the inadequacy of the funding. To be
funded at 0,7% of GDP when we have this huge inheritance of excellent R&D
infrastructure and personnel in the country, is to devalue that
inheritance. So Cabinet understands this and I am quite certain that we
will be increasing the budget that goes to research and development, to
science and technology and to the cultural industries of our country.

I wish to thank my colleagues very much and invite them to join us for
lunch at the Marks Building. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                      PROBATION SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Mr Chairperson, thank you for the
opportunity to address the National Assembly on the occasion of the second
reading debate on the Probation Services Amendment Bill.

The Bill is another significant milestone of the Government and indeed this
nation's effort to transform and further strengthen the country's criminal
justice system. This is underpinned by our request and our quest to protect
our society from all forms of criminality, while at the same time upholding
the rights of children as enshrined in the Constitution. In this regard the
introduction of this amendment to the Probation Services Act, No 116 of
1991, will go a long way in ensuring the achievements of that objective and
the fostering of an integrated justice system.

The objectives of these amendments are the following: Inserting the
definition relevant to the child and youth care system; inserting the
definition of a family finder; introducing assessment, support, referral
and mediation services in respect of victims of crime; introducing crime
prevention strategies through the provision of early intervention
programmes, including diversion services and family group conference; and
providing for the establishment of restorative justice programmes and
services as part of appropriate sentencing and diversion options.

Further, the objectives are to provide for the reception, assessment and
referral of an accused person and the rendering of early intervention
services and programmes; the investigation of the circumstances of an
accused person and the provision of a pre-trial report on the desirability
or otherwise of prosecution, and the investigation of the circumstances of
convicted persons; providing for the duties of assistant probation
officers; and lastly, providing for the mandatory assessment of every
arrested child within 48 hours of his/her arrest.

Our Constitution requires that every arrested person must be brought before
court within 48 hours of being arrested. It provides that a child can only
be detained as a measure of last resort. This provision echoes article 40
of the UN convention on the Rights of Children, which South Africa has
ratified.

In line with our Constitution, the department's 10-point programme and plan
prioritises addressing the problem of children who are in conflict with the
law. The problem of children who are in conflict with the law is a serious
challenge which is facing the country at this moment. It requires urgent
attention and involvement of all sectors of our society, including the Free
State.
There are currently about 2 322 children under the age of 18 awaiting trial
in prisons, and 1 767 of these children are awaiting trial in social
development facilities, ie secure places of safety and care. The
introduction of this Bill seeks to provide a legislative framework that
will strengthen Government's initiative relating to probation services that
are already undertaken through pilot projects, in order to improve services
and service delivery.

My department, with the assistance of donor funding, has studied
establishment, assessment and referral centres for children in conflict
with the law, as well as the one-stop justice centre in Port Elizabeth.
This centre was established in partnership with the Departments of
Correctional Services, Safety and Security, and Justice and Constitutional
Development. Furthermore, other pilots were introduced through the
appointment of assistant probation officers in the Western Cape, Limpopo
and Mpumalanga.

At present we have only 60 assistant probation officers in the country and
there are plans to appoint more. These assistant probation officers are
involved in monitoring persons placed under house arrest and assessed by
probation officers. Between September 1998 and February 2002, 379 children
were placed under the care of their parents and under the supervision of
probation officers. The progress of these children was monitored by
assistant probation officers.

The appointment of these assistant probration officers will go a long way
in providing a quality service to children in conflict with the law. The
placement of children under the care of their parents and under the
supervision of officers has cost benefits for the state. On the one hand it
costs on average of R94,60 per day for a child awaiting trial in prison,
while on the other hand when under house arrest it costs only R2,69 per
day.

The added benefit of this programme is that children awaiting trial under
the care of their parents and under the supervision of probation officers
are provided with a family environment which will enhance the wellbeing of
those children. It should be noted that out of those 379 children, 188 had
their cases eventually withdrawn in court. This means that 188 children
could have been in prison awaiting trail for a year or longer and could
have had their lives totally disrupted and their schooling interrupted only
to have the charges ultimately withdrawn.

My department has plans to replicate this programme throughout the country,
especially in rural areas where these services are inadequate.

The decision to place a child under family care must obviously be carefully
weighed against the concerns of safety and security of the community, and
the process of assessment is essential in this regard.

This process will require that we work in partnership with families, law
enforcement agencies, courts and indeed society as a whole. The passing of
the Probation Services Amendment Bill will pave the way for the Child
Justice Bill, which was approved by Cabinet in November last year and is
due to be introduced in Parliament in the very near future.

The Probation Services Amendment Bill will provide legal certainty to
innovative practices and practitioners who have been doing their best to
provide a progressive and effective service. It will help to ensure
equality of service provision so that all children in South Africa, as well
as adults requiring assistance, may be provided with services of high
quality. We must work together to ensure that South Africa's children come
first. [Applause.]

Mr J SELFE: Chairperson, I would like at the outset to apologise for the
fact that my colleague the hon Sandy Kalyan is unable to be here today. She
asked me to speak on her behalf and it is indeed a privilege to participate
in this debate on such an important topic.

Everybody who lives in South Africa is aware of the abnormally high levels
of criminality in our society. Many criminals, particularly here in the
Western Cape, become involved in gangs and crime at a very early age,
sometimes as early as 10 years of age. By their late teens thse people are
hardened criminals, like Renaldo Miller, who, at the age of 17, raped and
murdered six-year-old Samantha Isaacs in Lavender Hill.

This sort of thing happens every single day in all our communities across
South Africa. The Minister has referred to this as a serious problem. It is
not only a serious problem; it is a tragic problem that really undermines
the whole social fabric of our society.

Renaldo Miller has appropriately been sentenced to two terms of life
imprisonment. The question is whether, in different circumstances and with
early intervention, the tragic murder of Samantha Isaacs could have been
avoided.

The Constitution and other legislation guarantee the rights of children,
and one of these rights is only to be imprisoned or detained as a measure
of last resort. One of the major reasons for this is to prevent the
contamination of first-time offenders by other, more hardened, criminals.
As the Minister has said, many of these first-time offenders have their
cases withdrawn in any event.

This is one of the things that this Bill seeks to achieve: early
intervention and assessment of juvenile criminals with a view to breaking
the cycle of criminality. For these reasons, we welcome the amendments.
However, we have some misgivings about the practicality of giving effect in
particular to the provisions of the new section 4B.

The department of social services assured the committee that at least 80
assistant probation officers will shortly be appointed countrywide, and
that where there are no probation officers, social workers can assess
children. The reality is - and I think we all need to accept it - that 80
assistant probation officers for the entire country is probably too few.

We are worried that staff shortages will mean that assessments will take
longer than 48 hours, and that will mean that either a child is released
without an assessment, or the child will be detained for a longer period,
exposing them to precisely the criminal gang elements this Bill seeks to
avoid.

We, therefore, support the amendment, but would like to see the appointment
of probation officers as quickly as possible, and hopefully the appointment
of more of them. We would also like to see a firm commitment to the 48 hour
rule, so as to ensure that children who do not constitute a danger to
society are kept out of the criminal justice system. [Applause.]

Dr O S B BALOYI: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, today we are
debating amendments to the Probation Services Act, No 116 of 1991, the
objects of which are to provide interim measures to facilitate the
transformation of the child and youth care system and the proposed Child
Justice Bill.

This Bill introduces crime prevention strategies through the provision of
early intervention programmes like family group conferencing. It also
provides for the establishment of programmes aimed at the prevention and
combating of crime, and rendering assistance to the treatment of certain
persons involved in crime.

The powers and duties of probation officers are extended in this Bill. A
probation advisory committee is also established to advise the Minister on
matters regarding the probation services.

The Bill makes provision for the creation of assistant probation officers
in the respective provinces whose duties will include the monitoring of
persons placed under house arrest, family finding and assisting a probation
officer in their duty.

Another useful amendment in this Bill is the provision of mandatory
assessment of every arrested child within 48 hours of his or her arrest.
The challenge, however, is whether the department will have the capacity to
carry out these assessments within the 48 hours. Indeed, during the
committee stage of the Bill opinions were offered that maybe this provision
should be omitted until such time as the question of enough resources has
been addressed by the department.

It is our opinion that there are enough social workers out there who may
act as probation officers, if only they can change what they are doing
currently. We are mindful that the provision will force the Department of
Social Development to appoint more probation officers to address the issue.
We call on the department to do exactly that.

The department could interface with tertiary institutions in order to
collectively find ways of increasing the numbers of qualified social
workers in the service. Alternatively, we call on a paradigm shift whereby
there will be a reduction in the numbers of social workers doing case work,
which is not proactive and instead increases promotive and preventive
services.

There has been adequate consultation and interface with relevant role-
players and we are satisfied with that. The IFP supports the Probation
Services Amendment Bill and trusts that these amendments will facilitate -
in the interim, while waiting for the Child Justice Bill - the
transformation of the child and youth care system. [Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Chairperson, on 18 April the Deputy President
launched the Moral Regeneration Movement in an effort to stop the moral
decay in the country. The New NP believes that a major part of this decay
can be contributed to the breakdown in the family system, partly because
parents simply fail to fulfil their parental duties and because the
influence of the day is conducive to the creation of a generation of youth
who are of the opinion that it is acceptable to commit certain levels of
crime in order to survive.

This country has a responsibility to protect its children against the dark
future of crime and the resultant imprisonment which could be the start of
a vicious cycle which some people never escape from and could ultimately
end in death. I believe that we all agree that the transformation of the
child and youth care system is long overdue. Although the Bill before us
today only seeks to act as an interim measure to facilitate this
transformation process, any steps to address the problem of child and youth
care should be welcomed.

We believe that the 48-hour mandatory restriction for assessment of every
arrested child should go a long way in speeding up the process of either
getting the child back with his family or setting the assessment and
referral process in operation. The Bill makes provision for the speedy
investigation of the circumstances of the accused and the provision of a
pretrial report. The identifying of a family finder, whose main function
would be to trace the parents or guardian of the child who is being
prosecuted, is strengthening the whole process.

In die finale opsomming verwelkom die Nuwe NP die instelling van 'n
advieskomitee oor proefdienste wat die Minister kan adviseer oor
proefdienste in die land. Hierdie liggaam sal hopelik daartoe bydra dat die
proses voortdurend aangepas sal word by die jongste behoeftes wat mag
ontstaan sodat daar op die bes moontlike wyse met kinders gehandel kan
word. As gevolg van hierdie paar punte wat ek uitgelig het, het die Nuwe NP
geen beswaar om hierdie wetsontwerp te steun nie. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[In the final analysis, the New NP welcomes the establishment of an
advisory committee on probationary periods, which can advise the Minister
about times of probation in the country. Hopefully this body will
contribute to the continual adjustment of the process according to the
latest needs that may arise in order to deal with youths in the best
possible manner. Because of these few points that I have highlighted, the
new NP has no objection to supporting this Bill.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, Aa, Rhecizulu! The UDM supports the Probation
Services Amendment Bill. As South Africa is faced with a sharp increase in
crime, it has become necessary to review the current probation practices in
order to reduce recommitting of an offence and the high prison population.
The number of children incarcerated and institutionalised can only drop if
effective programmes are put in place to prevent crime. The country has few
probation officers to render services with regard to crime prevention,
divergent programmes, family group conferencing and effective supervision
services.

To overcome the crisis of the shortage of probation officers, an
occupational class called assistant probation officers was created. In
order to include this occupational class, ``assistant probation officer'',
in the existing Probation Services Act, clause 1(1), ``authorised assistant
officer'' has been added to the definition of ``authorised probation
officer''. A probation officer is a person who complies with the prescribed
requirements and who has been appointed under clause 2, and includes an
assistant probation officer.

The assistant probation officer is appointed under clause 2 and works under
the supervision of a probation officer. In order to accommodate the
assistant probation officers in the amendments, section 4 (2) (a) and (b)
of Act 116 of 1991 have been left intact. Their duties are spelt out as
follows: The monitoring of persons placed in house arrest; family finding
and assisting a probation officer with his or her duties.

In terms of insertion 4b, the probation officer has to carry out a
mandatory assessment of arrested children alleged to have committed an
offence as soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours after his or her
arrest.

The UDM appreciates the timeframes set and hopes that this will be met even
in areas where the road infrastructure militates against accessibility. All
this is done in the interest of the child. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Chairperson, the state that our prisons are in today
simply cannot provide an environment in which to rehabilitate young
offenders.
The Bill provides a few improvements which I will now highlight. It focuses
on crime prevention with the emphasis on early intervention strategies.
This is very important. The nature of these programmes is built upon the
restorative justice approach, with an emphasis on diversion away from the
formal criminal justice system. However, public safety must be considered
when diversion is applied.

The ACDP has always advocated victim-offender mediation and the restorative
justice approach. The Bill supports this approach in providing powers and
duties to the probation officer that are referenced against the assessment
and appropriate support needs of the arrested child.

The ACDP is especially pleased, in terms of the definition of
``assessment'' in the Bill, that it takes into account the impact of the
offence on the victim.

We therefore support the Bill where it aims to assist young offenders
through intervention programmes to adjust their behaviour according to
programmes that will guide them to live more responsible lives.
Mr E SALOOJEE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, the amending Bill
before the House today seeks to improve the legal framework within which to
expand our existing system of probation services. The hon the Minister has
already pointed out a number of significant elements of this Bill. Because
of the size of the Bill, it may seem to some members that it is an
insignificant piece of legislation, but, in fact, it forms an important
step in the transformation of the child and youth justice system. Although
we want to make this debate a short one, that should not suggest in any way
that this Bill is not of great importance.

The amendments to the Probation Services Act of 1991 provide for the
appointment of assistant probation officers and for the introduction of
measures aimed at fighting crime through early intervention in the area of
child justice. To this effect, it defines certain concepts that are
integral to the system, like, as has been mentioned, family finding, family
conferencing and, of course, diversion programmes. I do not want to mention
all the other things that have already been referred to.

We know that some of these practices and services are already in operation
in some areas, but we must acknowledge that they are essentially part of a
new paradigm in the way Government and ultimately society deals with young
persons in trouble with the law.

The amendments form part of a historic and fundamental shift towards
restorative justice, which is an approach to crime prevention and
management that is aimed at holding offenders directly accountable to the
people they have violated and at restoring the losses and harm suffered by
the victims.

It is internationally accepted that the framework of restorative justice
provides an opportunity for the offender, through a process that could
involve victims, families and members of the community, to be reintegrated
into the community. This is critical in view of research findings
internationally that have suggested that the earlier an intervention of the
restorative kind takes place, the greater the chance that the young
offender will not become a hardened criminal.

Elements in the Bill that speak specifically to the idea of restorative
justice are those practices that will enable both officials in the
Department of Social Development and officials in the criminal justice
system to make decisions about whether a child offender should be dealt
with through the formal court system or whether the child and his or her
community stand to benefit more if the child is diverted from the court
system and ultimately prison.

The Bill empowers the Minister to establish further services and programmes
aimed at early intervention and diversion for children in respect of whom
an assessment has indicated that they are suitable candidates for such a
programme.

It also gives the Minister the discretion to establish a probation advisory
committee to advise him on issues around the services. Our committee hopes
that the hon Minister will set up such a committee, and that through this
committee courts could be sensitised to the needs and rights of children in
the court system.

A very important aspect of the Bill that elicited lengthy discussions in
the portfolio committee is the insertion of 4B, which states that:


  Every child who is alleged to have committed an offence shall as soon as
  possible, but not later than 48 hours after his or her arrest, be
  assessed by a probation officer.]

The aim of this procedure is that a probation officer will do an assessment
of every detained child to establish whether the child should be diverted
out of the formal court system and, therefore, forms a crucial link in the
effectiveness of the diversion programme. This is where we had this long
discussion.

From all the evidence that I have secured, and some very recently, a
significant number of additional probation officers has been appointed. In
fact, this whole concept of assistant probation officers would assist. We
must be mindful of the fact that there are literally thousands of
registered social workers who could also be deployed into this aspect of
the work until such time as we are able to ensure that there are sufficient
probation officers to deal with this problem effectively.

We must point out that this section is consistent with the constitutional
provision that every detained person must appear in court within 48 hours
after his or her arrest, provided that the expiry of the 48 hours coincides
with a normal court day. Therefore, this is an important step towards
ensuring that we realise those rights enshrined in our Constitution.

However, members expressed real concern that in view of resource
constraints, the Department of Social Development might not be in a
position to ensure that this procedure takes place within the timeframe
mentioned. We are, in fact, currently faced with a situation that hundreds
of children remain in prison precisely because of a lack of capacity and
resources on the side of Social Development.

With regard to social services, there is a lot to be attended to by a
probation officer. But this is precisely the point that we make, that there
has been a dramatic improvement, as I pointed out previously, and that we
could deal with these problems substantially and within the very near
future be able to provide a complete and adequate service.

We are also faced with the reality that there is a huge disparity between
the availability of probation officers in urban centres and rural areas.
These questions have been part of the history of this amending Bill, which
was already under discussion and review in 1990, and is being dealt with by
the department. There is sufficient evidence in documents. We do not have
the time to go into that, but from what I have read I am absolutely
convinced that we are rapidly building capacity.

Despite current shortcomings in allocation, we must establish the principle
in law that constitutional imperatives place an obligation on Government to
make services and resources available that will see, at least, the phased
realisation of constitutional rights. We have been given a clear
understanding that the department has developed the system of probation
officers to such an extent that the services set out in this Bill are now
feasible.

From the side of the committee we want to signal that we will be monitoring
the implementation of this Bill very carefully to ensure that where gaps
continue to exist, the Government is urged to make sufficient resources
available so that those gaps can be filled. And here I say this should not
just be the responsibility of members of Parliament who are members of the
Social Development committee. I think it should be the responsibility of
all parliamentarians when they do their constituency work.

Finally, I want to return to the historic significance of this Bill. Not
only will it serve to strengthen the functioning of the probation service
system, but it forms part of a broader review of a whole range of
legislative measures, including the child care legislation aimed at
providing for and protecting the best interests of the child. The real
historic development is that for the first time in the history of our
country, we will soon be tabling a Bill in this Assembly which will be a
comprehensive child care Act. Such an Act has never been part of our
system.

All these reforms that are being effected in legislation affecting children
suggest, in a very substantial way, the utter and complete dedication of
this Government to ensuring that the children of our country find their
proper place under the sun, and are able to live healthy, developing lives.
That will be the contribution in the future towards a good, functioning and
healthy South African society.

The principles set out in this Bill are consistent. I will not go through
all of them. We want to believe that it will contribute to the development
of not only young people, but also to the overall development of our
communities, and enable them to take full responsibility for their actions
and carry this responsibility by playing a constructive rather than a
destructive role in community life. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Mr Chairperson, I would like to take
this opportunity to thank all members and all parties for supporting this
Bill and the amendment.

I also share the concerns that have been voiced, specifically around
section 4B, on the possibility that we might not necessarily have the
capacity to fulfil this. We are in a position where we are under pressure
to change it, but I fear that if we do so and remove that 48-hour
stipulation, we might run into problems in that it might not happen in the
manner that we would want it to. As long as that is there, I think it will,
one way or the other, force the department and the justice system in this
country to do something about those children.

But that will need, necessarily, the support of almost everybody here, the
monitoring of children under detention and the working together, both of
Government and the whole of civil society, including the religious sector,
to ensure that what is in the Constitution becomes a reality not only for
the elderly, but more importantly, for the children, and that we put
children first.

Once again, I would like to thank the House. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 12:18.
