                          AGRICULTURE AND THE MEDIA
                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1)  kennis  neem  van  die   stellings,   soos   gerapporteer   in   die
       Landbouweekblad van 20 September 2002, deur Mary Metcalfe,  Gautengse
       LUK vir Landbou, Bewaring, Omgewing en Grondsake dat  van  die  beste
       arbeidspraktyke in die landbou aangetref word, hoewel daar steeds  'n
       siening is dat dit nie die geval is nie - hierdie ongunstige  houding
       moet verander word;


  (2) ook daarvan kennis neem dat  die  persepsie  bestaan  dat  die  media
       enkele  voorvalle  uitsonder  en  wanindrukke  skep  waardeur   boere
       gestereotipeer word;


  (3) van mening is dat dit die landbou sal bevoordeel om meer simpatiek te
       wees teenoor kwessies soos vakbonde waardeur mense bemagtig kan word;


  (4) groot waardering vir die landbou in Gauteng  het  en  vir  die  goeie
       verhouding wat tussen die LUR se departement en Agri-Gauteng heers en
       graag wil sien dat dié verhouding verder versterk word aangesien  dié
       sektor  se  betrokkenheid  by  beplanning  rondom  stedelike  gebiede
       noodsaaklik is; en


  (5) van mening is dat die landbou 'n spesifieke rol te speel het  in  die
       enorme uitdaging wat stedelike indringing in landbougebiede meebring.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the statements, as reported in  the  Landbouweekblad  dated  20
       September 2002, by Ms Mary Metcalfe, Gauteng's MEC  for  Agriculture,
       Conservation, Environmental and Land Affairs, that some of  the  best
       labour practices can be found in agriculture, although there is still
       a perception that this is not the case - this  unfavourable  attitude
       should change;
  (2) also notes that the perception exists that the media isolates certain
       incidents  and  thus  creates  erroneous  impressions  through  which
       farmers are stereotyped;


  (3) is of the opinion that  it  would  benefit  agriculture  to  be  more
       sympathetic towards matters such as trade unions through which people
       could be empowered;


  (4) has great appreciation for agriculture in Gauteng and  for  the  good
       relationship that exists  between  the  MEC's  department  and  Agri-
       Gauteng and would like to see this relationship strengthened  further
       as this sector's  involvement  in  planning  around  urban  areas  is
       essential; and


  (5) is of the opinion that agriculture has a specific role to play in the
       enormous  challenge  posed  by  urban  encroachment  on  agricultural
       areas.]

                         INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) recognises that Saturday, 21 September 2002,  is  set  aside  as  the
       International Day of Peace;


  (2) notes that all over the world countries  without  peace  are  fertile
       grounds for  fights,  violence  and  mass  destruction  of  life  and
       property;


  (3) condemns the recent events of a coup d'état of the Government of  the
       Côte d'Ivoire - we should stop the outdated notion that the  gun  and
       killings solve problems; and


  (4) therefore appeals to all its honourable members to pray for peace, to
       plant seeds of peace in  their  hearts  and  sincerely  spread  peace
       locally and globally.


  The World seeks peace!

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock and disbelief the escape by  3  prisoners  from  the
       holding cells in the Cape High Court yesterday;


  (2) further notes that the same thing happened last year, whereby one  of
       the 3 prisoners escaped from the same holding cells;


  (3) calls upon the Provincial Commissioner to thoroughly investigate  and
       identify those unwanted elements in our police force who  might  have
       assisted these prisoners to escape;

       Western Cape that the police officers who were on duty  in  the  High
       Court will be replaced by other officers; and


  (5) reaffirms our commitment to root out corrupt officials in our system.

   CELEBRATING OUR HERITAGE, WITH REFERENCE TO THE REGIONAL DIMENSTON, TO
                  INFORM OUR NATIONAL AND AFRICAN IDENTITY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE  COUNCIL:  Madam  Chairperson,  it  is  a  distinctive
privilege and honour to be  standing  here  today  in  a  country  that  can
celebrate a heritage which is somewhat unique, distinctive, interesting  and
complex.

In doing so, it is important that we understand that South Africa, in  terms
of its heritage, has been empirically and scientifically referred to as  the
cradle of humankind, with a history that pre-dates 3,5  million  years,  and
that the site at  which  the  fossils  of  humankind  were  found  has  been
declared a World Heritage Site.

It is also interesting that the oldest remains of modern humans  were  found
in Klasies River in the Eastern Cape; quite unique,  quite  distinctive  and
quite interesting. The adage or expression of "Women and children first"  is
derived from South Africa and a place called  Hermanus,  where  a  shipwreck
took place. It is also interesting that South Africa is  the  first  country
to celebrate its living heritage  through  the  communication  of  our  oral
history as it occurs in Dukuza, formerly known as Stanger in KwaZulu-Natal.

Given this prehistory and this heritage that we have,  it  is  important  to
note that not very far from here is a place known as Robben Island, a  place
where people who held different views from those of the authorities,  slaves
who rebelled against their masters who sought to infringe or  violate  their
dignity, and political prisoners or political persons who sought  to  affirm
the dignity and the struggle for freedom and equality were incarcerated.  It
was a place not far from the precincts of  this  Parliament  which  was  not
accessible to the people of this nation,  of  Southern  Africa  and  of  the
world. It is a paradox and a wonderful irony  that  today  that  site  is  a
World Heritage Site.

It is also an expression and a symbol of the  fortitude,  the  courage,  the
resilience, the generosity and the  magnanimity  of  those  individuals  who
were unlawfully, wrongfully,  immorally  incarcerated  for  the  convictions
which were consistent in achieving a humane society and a humanity  that  is
equal, committed to freedom and to the affirmation of the  dignity  of  each
and every human being.

In this context that I deem my presence here today and the  opportunity  and
privilege to lead  this  debate  as  quite  a  wonderful  and  extraordinary
opportunity because I, as other members in this Chamber,  represent  a  very
significant and  important  moment  in  our  history;  a  history  which  in
political terms comes from  despair  arising  from  political  and  economic
subjugation, and social repression to a history of hope and  reconciliation,
one that is committed to the achievement of equality.

In this Chamber  there  are  members  who  have  been  part  and  parcel  of
achieving a wonderful instrument  called  the  Constitution,  which  is  the
birth certificate and this birth right of our nation;  a  constitution  that
is generally accepted as the most advanced and forward-looking  document  on
which the ethos of a  nation  and  its  struggles  is  reflected.  It  is  a
wonderful moment in our history. It is a wonderful moment in our history  to
be sitting here, to say that we are proud citizens, we have  a  heritage  of
having the world descend on our soil, to share with us  our  experience  and
our vision to our commitment to nonracialism. It is an epoch of hope.

It is a wonderful moment when we think that the world again  not  very  long
ago had descended on us in great numbers, large numbers, reflecting  on  the
commitment to sustainable development. We  must  note  the  contribution  of
members of this Chamber and particularly the Chairperson, who  has  in  that
very conference presented a document about of the need for  the  eradication
of poverty in the context of world sustainable development.

Many times we tend to forget how fortunate and  lucky  we  are.  This  is  a
moment in our history that very few other people would enjoy.  Therefore  we
have a particular commitment, given the fact that the world  recognises  the
particular pioneering role that South Africans can play in  the  achievement
of equality, in the  eradication of racialism, in the affirmation of  gender
equality, that as  public  representatives  we  have  to  move  our  country
forward.

Our esteemed President Comrade Thabo Mbeki had the following to say:


  We must work to rediscover and claim the African heritage for the benefit
  especially of our young generations. From South Africa  to  Ethiopia  lie
  strewn ancient fossils which in the stillness speak still of the  African
  origins of all humanity. Recorded history and material  things  the  time
  left behind also speak of Africa's historic contribution to the  universe
  of philosophy, the natural sciences, human settlement,  and  organisation
  and the creative arts. Being certain and not always were we the  children
  of the abyss, we  will  do  what  we  have  to  do  to  achieve  our  own
  renaissance. We trust that we will not only better our own condition as a
  people, but will also make a contribution, however small, to the  success
  of Africa's Renaissance, towards the identification of the century  ahead
  of us as the African Century.

It is in this context that the topic of the  debate  was  chosen.  A  debate
which speaks about celebrating our heritage from a region of perspective  to
inform our national and our African identity.

The hon Deputy President has said:


  Today Africa is recognised as the cradle of humankind. In our part of the
  continent we have a rich and varied past that is only now appreciated for
  its complexity and its diversity. Indeed, our heritage is the  foundation
  from which we are working to rebuild our society.

It is this recognition  of  our  diversity,  complexity  and  richness  that
should inspire us to reconcile, to reconstruct  and  to  rebuild,  and  take
each other's hands and say together as a nation,  however  diverse,  however
different, we will march forward collectively with one vision  of  improving
the quality of the lives of our people.

The President has also alluded to the fact that when we speak about  freedom
in the context of celebrating our heritage we should not do so in  a  narrow
or political sense only. Our freedom should be given expression through  the
liberation of our people, who have suffered through  socio-economic  bondage
for many generations. It is important that we do so.  We  must  be  able  to
liberate our minds and, more importantly, we must be able  to  liberate  and
free our souls. In that sense can we only then say that  we  are  completely
free.

When we talk about the Freedom Park that is being planned and  designed,  it
would then be  a  record  of  the  history  of  our  people,  but  also  the
responsibility  of  all  South  Africans  to  ensure  that  we  consistently
promote, support and fulfil the  vision  of  a  nonracial,  nonsexist  South
Africa; a vision that was enshrined  in  the  Freedom  Charter  in  1955,  a
vision that takes on board not only the struggles of a  certain  section  of
our community, but the struggles of  our  people  as  a  collective.  It  is
important to recognise this particular important contribution  that  we  can
make as a nation.

Heritage cannot have any provincial or national boundaries. It is  for  this
reason that South Africa has gone into  various  co-operative  arrangements.
For example, there  is  the  Maluti-Drakensberg  Transfrontier  Conservation
Area. The Drakensberg's huge, imposing mountain range, where men  and  women
are somewhat small and diminutive  is  also  not  only  a  heritage  of  our
environment, but a heritage of cultures, of people that live in the  valleys
of the Drakensberg. It straddles the  provinces  of  KwaZulu-Natal  and  the
Free State. It goes beyond our national borders to Lesotho. It says  to  our
people and our nation that here is an opportunity  where  we  can  celebrate
not only our environmental heritage, but also our cultural heritage.

Here we have an opportunity to ensure that we can  give  expression  to  the
freedom that our President spoke about, not only our political freedom,  but
our freedom from social and economic bondage.  We  can  only  do  so  if  we
recognise ourselves that, in celebrating this heritage of  ours,  we  do  so
with the common view that the affirmation of our dignity  means  the  change
in the quality of our lives so that we can enjoy  our  freedom  and  thereby
affirm our dignity even more.

There are other examples not far  from  where  I  live.  There  is  also  an
arrangement in  terms  of  a  transfrontier  conservation  park  called  the
Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, which  involves  Botswana  and  South  Africa.
There are historical  linkages  between  the  Setswana-speaking  people  who
reside in the North West province and other provinces  of  course,  and  the
people in Botswana. Not far from where I live  we  have  a  place  that  was
formerly known as Pilanestad or Saulspoort, where the  tribe  still  has  as
its paramount chief, Paramount Chief Lincwe, who is from Botswana.

These linkages cannot be wished away or eradicated  and  we  recognise  that
notwithstanding our national boundaries there are  linguistic,  tribal,  and
historical associations that we must respect. As we celebrate our  heritage,
we should not do so in a narrow or parochial sense, but we should do  so  in
a collective and diverse sense in order that we could affirm our unity.

This country has a particular responsibility in terms of ensuring that  when
we look and examine our past,  we  do  so  for  the  collective  benefit  of
humankind. We do not do so for a specific benefit.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Madam Chairperson, I am sorry I  have  spoken
too  much,  but  thank  you  for  the  latitude  that  you  have  given  me.
[Applause.]

The CHAIPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Now, Chief  Whip,  you  have  put  me  in
trouble. You have revealed that I gave you latitude. [Laughter.] There  will
not be a similar undertaking  for  the  hon  Van  Niekerk.  [Laughter.]  Hon
member, the clock is ticking.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I am sorry that the clock is ticking. I  do
not know why that hon member should have preference, just because he is  the
Chief Whip. [Laughter.]

Our former President, the international icon  Nelson  Mandela,  said  during
the opening ceremony of the Robben Island Museum on 24 September 1997:


  May this monument and the museum strengthen our resolve that never  again
  shall this land see the oppression of one by another, nor the suppression
  of any community's heritage.

This coincides with the assurance President Mbeki gave in  the  Other  Place
yesterday, when he said that minority rights  would  be  part  of  the  peer
review of the African Union.

Although South Africans have diverse cultures, elements of  national  unity,
nation-building,  reconciliation   and   national   patriotism   should   be
emphasised. The ideal is to preserve, exhibit and promote  our  diverse  but
connected values and cultures.

We should all be encouraged, after this debate and  after  the  celebrations
on 24 September, to  embrace  South  Africa's  common  heritage.  The  three
primary national symbols, the anthem, flag and coat of arms,  represent  our
new   democracy.   Key   values   underpinning   these   new   symbols   are
reconciliation, unity in diversity and nation-building. This is  surely  the
reason why the national symbols are  the  theme  of  Heritage  Day  for  the
second time, which I only found out yesterday.

But we must also be frank on this day and because of this the question  then
arises regarding our parliamentary symbols. When are we  going  to  finalise
this long overdue process and when  will  we  see  the  new  ones  reflected
behind the Chair? During  colonial  and  apartheid  times  our  museums  and
monuments in each of our provinces excluded the majority  of  citizens.  Now
community   consultation,   effective   use   of   limited   resources   and
accessibility are  guidelines  to  redress  these  imbalances.  Again,  when
taking this into consideration, it is  absolutely  inexcusable  that  we  in
Parliament are still, after eight years, struggling to finalise  the  policy
of Parliament as to how to deal with  and  exhibit  our  national  heritage,
such as the artworks and furniture of Parliament.

It is also important that money should be found to  fund  the  long  overdue
Mandela statue at the buildings of Parliament.  We  owe  it  to  Madiba,  to
South Africa and to the world. We must start adding to our heritage  instead
of withholding from it or destroying it.

Gedurende die Erfenisdagviering van  2000  het  die  klem  op  veeltaligheid
geval. Dit was 'n poging om Suid-Afrikaners te verenig, om trots te wees  op
elkeen se taal en kultuur en om die  reg  uit  te  oefen  wat  die  Grondwet
elkeen bied om die amptelike taal van sy keuse te gebruik,  om  bemagtig  te
word en respek vir mekaar se tale en kulture te hê. Dit was  ook  die  soeke
na onderlinge begrip vir die verskille. Dit maak ons werklik  vry  in  Suid-
Afrika.

Ongelukkig is  dit  nog  net  die  Weskaapse  Wetgewer  wat  'n  provinsiale
taalbeleid het, maar die Nuwe NP het nou in elke provinsie 'n  voorstel  vir
'n taalwet wat ter tafel gelê word. In die Wes-Kaap het ons reeds die  steun
van die Minister van Plaaslike regering om 'n veeltaligheidsbeleid  in  elke
munisipaliteit te vestig.

Die Parlement  gaan  binnekort  'n  veeltaligheidskonferensie  aanbied.  Ons
beplan nou al vir twee jaar daarvoor. Dit is spesiaal  vir  parlementariërs,
want veeltaligheid moet as 'n bemagtigende instrument gesien word en nie  as
'n luukse nie. Dit begin hier by elkeen  van  ons  en  hierdie  Raad  is  'n
voorbeeld wat nagestreef kan word.

Suid-Afrika moét nou 'n nasionale  talebeleid  en  -wet  kry.  Ons  het  nou
genoeg beloftes en genoeg verwarring gehad  en  genoeg  klem  op  Engels  is
gepleeg. Dit moet nou end kry. Die inheemse tale van Suid-Afrika het  genoeg
onder die Engelse hegemonie gely. Die afskeep van  Afrikaans  en  die  ander
inheemse tale op alle gebiede, wat die  SABC,  universiteite,  wetgewers  en
die Parlement insluit, is onaanvaarbaar. Dit het tyd geword  dat  ons  hande
vat en die saak reggestel  kry.  Tsonga,  Venda,  Tswana,  Zulu,  Afrikaans,
Xhosa, Ndebele, Sotho en Pedi het net so 'n  reg  op  goeie  behandeling  in
Suid-Afrika as Engels. Ons moet elkeen sonder verskoning hierdie reg  opeis.
Dit is ons grondwetlike reg. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[During  the  Heritage  Day  celebrations  of  2000  the  emphasis  was   on
multilingualism. It was an attempt at uniting South Africans,  to  be  proud
of each one's language and culture  and  to  exercise  the  right  that  the
Constitution affords everyone to use the official language of their  choice,
to be empowered  and  to  have  respect  for  one  another's  languages  and
cultures.  It  was  also  the  quest  for  mutual  understanding  of   these
differences. This really frees us in South Africa.

Unfortunately it is only the Western Cape legislature that has a  provincial
policy, but the New NP has now tabled a proposal  for  a  language  Act  for
every province. We, in the Western Cape have the support of the Minister  of
local  government  to  introduce  a  policy  of  multilingualism   to   each
municipality.

Parliament will shortly present a conference  on  multilingualism.  We  have
been  planning  this  for  two   years   now.   It   is   specifically   for
parliamentarians, because multilingualism must  be  seen  as  an  empowering
instrument and not as a luxury. It starts here with each one of us and  this
Council is an example that can be emulated.

South Africa must now acquire a national language policy and  Act.  We  have
had enough promises, enough confusion and enough emphasis  that  was  placed
on English. It must end now. The indigenous languages have  suffered  enough
under the hegemony of English.  The  neglect  of  Afrikaans  and  the  other
indigenous languages in every area, which includes the  SABC,  universities,
legislatures and Parliament, is unacceptable. The time has come  for  us  to
join hands to rectify this matter. Tsonga, Venda, Tswana,  Zulu,  Afrikaans,
Xhosa, Ndebele, Sotho and Pedi have the same right as English to be  treated
well in South Africa. Everyone of us  must,  without  any  apologies,  claim
this right. It is our constitutional right.]

Martin Luther King said: ``Peace is not only the absence of  war  ...''.  In
conclusion, I want  to  add  ``...  it  is  the  freedom  to  celebrate  our
individual heritage in our diversity''. [Applause.]

Mnr R J KING: Voorsitter, u moet  maar  verskoon  as  ons  Wes-Kapenaars  op
hierdie Erfenisdag vanjaar ekstra spoggerig is - dit is  immers  die  350ste
verjaardag van ons Moederstad, die mooie, skone Kaapstad.

Erfenisdag  is  sekerlik  dié  dag  waarop  ons   met   groot   dankbaarheid
bestekopname maak van dit waarvoor  ons  lief  is,  en  is  ons  nie  ryklik
geseënd nie.

Enigeen van die agb lede in hierdie Huis wat al die wêreld getoer  het,  sal
weet  dat  daar  oral  ongelooflike  monumente  staan.  Dit  is  bewyse  van
glorieryke skeppings van  die  mens  en  sy  vermoëns:  Teaters,  katedrale,
museums,  paleise,  stadions  en  amfiteaters  vir  honderde  duisende,   en
stadspleine  vir  miljoene  -  menslike  skeppings  wat  bekend   staan   as
wonderwerke, piramides, hangende tuine en oorhellende torings.

Ons in die Wes-Kaap het soveel om te bied, maar so  anders.  Ons  is  ryklik
geseënd en bedeeld met die Goddelike skepping.

Ek het as 'n jong man in 1970 pas in Kaapstad begin werk toe my  hoofkantoor
my  opdrag  gegee  het  om  'n  Amerikaanse  aardrykskundige   na   die   Du
Toitskloofberge te neem. Ek het nie geweet waaroor die opdrag gaan  nie.  Ek
het maar my plig gedoen. Toe ons daar  kom,  het  ons  elke  half  kilometer
gestop, dan het die oubaas uitgeklim en die berge rondom so bekyk.  Aan  die
einde het hy vir my gesê: ``You know, Mr King,  this  is  the  77th  country
that I visit in the world to  observe  their  mountains.  This  is  now  the
seventh time that I came back to South Africa to come and  look  at  the  Du
Toitskloof Mountains - the most beautiful mountain range in the world.''

Dit het 'n Amerikaner gevat om vir my te wys die  berge  waar  ek  elke  dag
deur die klowe ry, is die mooiste berge in die wêreld. Tot  my  skaamte  het
ek nog elke dag weer aan daardie gesprek gedink as ek deur die pas ry.

My kollega en ek het eenkeer deur Engeland getoer en in 'n dorpie noord  van
Londen het ons in ons kenmerkende Springbokondersteuners se klere geloop  en
twee ou dames raakgeloop.  Toe  hulle  Suid-Afrika  sien,  toe  sê  die  een
dame:``Have you ever been to Hermanus?'' Ons sê toe ons ken Hermanus. Sy  sê
toe:``The most beautiful little seaside town in  the  world.''  Dit  is  wat
ander mense van ons land dink.

Ons het so baie ontvang en so baie om voor dankbaar te wees en met ons  hele
wese te bewaar en te vertroetel. Die geskiedenis sal ons  nooit  vergewe  as
een jota of tittel van hierdie erfenis langs die pad verlore moet gaan  nie.
Die rykdom van die Wes-Kaap se menseverskeidenheid, waar  kom  dit  vandaan?
Ek wil vandag slegs die bydrae van een groepering  aanraak  en  wat  vir  my
hierin uitstaan en dit is die bydrae van die slawekultuur aan die Kaap.

Suid-Afrika is die een unieke land in Afrika waar slawe ingevoer is  en  nie
uitgevoer is nie. Dit was as gevolg van die opdrag wat Jan van Riebeeck  van
die VOC gekry het, naamlik dat hy nie die Kaap se  mense  mag  verslaaf  het
nie. Daar word bereken dat oor 'n tydperk van 180  jaar  soveel  as  63  000
slawe na Kaapstad gebring is. Die eerste slawe aan die Kaap het  hoofsaaklik
uit Wes-Afrika gekom  -  Guinea,  Angola  en  later  ook  uit  Mosambiek  en
Madagaskar. Slawe is ook uit Indië  ingevoer,  maar  die  kenmerkendste  van
daardie tyd het uit die  Ooste  gekom  -  die  huidige  Java,  Bali,  Timor,
Maleisië en China. Teen 1748 was daar meer slawe aan die Kaap  as  wat  daar
Europeërs  was.  Die  invloed  op  plase,  fabrieke,  die   boubedryf,   die
klerebedryf en in die oorgrote meerderheid huishoudings is onbepaalbaar.

Die  een  monument  van  die  saamgroei  van  die  destydse  bruin  en   wit
gemeenskappe in  die  Kaap  is  die  Afrikaanse  taal.  Die  verskynsel  dat
Afrikaans, eens die kombuistaal, op 'n stadium gesien is  as  die  taal  van
die verdrukker, was 'n afwyking eerder as die norm. Die Afrikaanse  taal  is
gebou deur taalstryders,  maar  ook  omdat  dit  die  praktiese  medium  van
kommunikasie geword het tussen slawemeester en slaaf, en  tussen  slawe  uit
verskillende wêrelddele. Afrikaans was ook in die tagtigerjare die taal  van
verset in die Wes-Kaap.

Afrikaans se oorsprong lê dus nie in die hoogste raadsale van die land  nie.
Afrikaans se oorsprong lê in die harte en op die tong  van  mense  uit  alle
lae van die samelewing. Nadat die kettings van slawerny in 1834 gebreek  is,
het die wit en bruin  gemeenskappe  in  die  Wes-Kaap  natuurlik  nader  aan
mekaar gegroei deur die bande van bloed, godsdiens, taal en  kultuur.  Omdat
taal vir ons in hierdie provinsie so uiters belangrik is, wil ek by  hierdie
geleentheid met u gesels oor die instelling en  werksaamhede  van  die  Wes-
Kaapse Taalkomitee.

Dié komitee is ingestel ingevolge die  Wes-Kaapse  Provinsiale  Talewet  van
1998  en  Raadskennisgewing  120  van  1997  -  soos  gepubliseer   in   die
Staatskoerant  van  15  Desember  1997.  Die  komitee  is  daarna   as   die
Provinsiale Taalkomitee van die Wes-Kaap erken, ingevolge  die  Wet  op  die
Pan-Suid-Afrikaanse Taalraad, 1995.

Dit beteken dat die Taalkomitee 'n  statutêre  liggaam  van  die  Wes-Kaapse
provinsiale regering is, asook 'n provinsiale taalkomitee  van  Pansat.  Die
Taalkomitee  doen  verantwoording   aan   die   Provinsiale   Minister   van
Kultuursake, Sport en Ontspanning.

Die Taalkomitee se visie is om al die mense van die Wes-Kaap  deur  taal  te
bemagtig, hul menswaardigheid deur agting vir mekaar se tale te versterk  en
veeltaligheid te bevorder. Die Taalkomitee se missie is om veeltaligheid  in
die provinsie aktief te bevorder, die gelyke gebruik van die drie  amptelike
tale in die provinsie te monitor,  en  die  ontwikkeling  van  die  voorheen
gemarginaliseerde inheemse tale van die Wes-Kaap te ondersteun.

Die Wes-Kaapse Taalkomitee het 'n mandaat van die  provinsiale  regering  om
die gebruik van Afrikaans, Engels en Xhosa in die  provinsiale  regering  te
monitor.  'n  Marknavorsingsagentskap   is   aangestel   om   'n   omvattend
taalbestekopname van die provinsiale regering en sy kliënte se  taalgebruike
en -voorkeure te maak. Dié baanbrekerswerk, die eerste in sy soort in  Suid-
Afrika, is einde Maart 2002 afgehandel.

Een van die belangrikste bevindings - en ek sluit aan by my kollega wat  pas
gepraat het - was dat daar 'n skerp afname was in die gebruik van  Afrikaans
in die provinsiale regering ten gunste van Engels; en  dit  terwyl  66%  van
die amptenare Afrikaanssprekend is. Laasgenoemde  syfer  korreleer  met  die
59% Afrikaanssprekendes in ons provinsie.

Daar is wel 'n mate van groei in  die  gebruik  van  Xhosa,  maar  dit  moet
gesien word teen die agtergrond van die  ernstige  marginalisering  van  die
taal. Afrikaans- en Xhosasprekendes gebruik Engels as 'n brugtaal  in  veral
interne geskrewe kommunikasie. Daar  is  misleidende  positiewe  aanvaarding
van dié toedrag van sake by Afrikaanssprekendes, maar dieselfde  aanvaarding
is gelukkig nie by Xhosasprekendes nie. Dit bly egter 'n elite oplossing  om
Engels by verstek te gebruik.  'n  Kopskuif  is  nodig  in  die  provinsiale
regering en Afrikaans- en Xhosasprekendes behoort  hulle  meer  te  handhaaf
vir sover dit die gebruik van hulle tale aangaan.
Ek kan nog baie praat, maar ek wil nie oor my tyd  gaan  nie.  Ek  wil  eers
afsluit en baie dankie sê vir die geleentheid om dié Huis te kon  toespreek.
[Applous.]

Die VOORSITTER VAN DIE  NRVP:  Baie  dankie,  geagte  lid.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr R J KING (Western Cape): Chairperson, you will have to excuse us  if  we
from the Western Cape are extra boastful on this Heritage Day  this  year  -
after all, it is the 350th anniversary of our Mother  City,  the  beautiful,
lovely Cape Town.

Heritage Day is surely the  one  day  on  which  we  take  stock  with  much
gratitude of that which is dear to  us,  and  realise  that  we  are  richly
blessed.

Any one of the hon members in this House who has toured the world will  know
that there are unbelievable  monuments  everywhere.  They  are  evidence  of
glorious creations by mankind and of his  abilities:  Theatres,  cathedrals,
museums, palaces, stadiums and amphitheatres for hundreds of thousands,  and
public squares for  millions  -  human  creations  known  as  mighty  works,
pyramids, hanging gardens and leaning towers.

We in the Western Cape have so much to offer, but  something  so  different.
We are richly blessed and endowed with God's creation.

As a young man in 1970 I had only just started working in Cape Town when  my
head office ordered me to take an American geographer to the  Du  Toitskloof
Mountains. I was not aware of what this instruction was about. I was  simply
doing my duty. When we arrived there, we stopped  every  half  a  kilometre,
and then the old man climbed out and surveyed the mountains  around  us.  At
the end he said to me: ``You know, Mr King, this is the 77th country that  I
visit in the world to observe their mountains. This is now the seventh  time
that I came back to South Africa to come  and  look  at  the  Du  Toitskloof
Mountains - the most beautiful mountain range in the world.''

It took an American to show me that  the  mountains  among  whose  passes  I
travel every day are the most beautiful mountains in the world. To my  shame
I have thought of that conversation every time that I travelled through  the
pass.

My colleague and I once toured through England  and  in  a  village  to  the
north of London we strolled around in our Springbok supporters' clothes  and
met two old ladies. When they saw South Africa,  one  of  the  ladies  said:
``Have you ever been to Hermanus?'' We told her that we knew Hermanus.  Then
she said: ``The most beautiful little seaside town in the world.''  That  is
what other people think of our country.

We have received so much and so much to be grateful and  which  to  preserve
and to cherish with our whole being. History would never forgive us  if  one
jot or tittle of this heritage were to be lost along the way. The wealth  of
the Western Cape's human diversity, where does  it  come  from?  I  want  to
touch upon the contribution  of  only  one  group  today  and  what  I  find
exceptional about it, and that is the contribution of the slave  culture  in
the Cape.

South Africa is unique in that is the only country in  Africa  where  slaves
we imported and not exported. This was as a result of  the  order  given  to
Jan van Riebeeck by the VOC, namely that he may not enslave  the  people  of
the Cape. It is estimated that as many as 63  000  slaves  were  brought  to
Cape Town over a period of 180 years. The first  slaves  in  the  Cape  came
primarily from West Africa - Guinea, Angola and later also  from  Mozambique
and Madagascar. Slaves were  also  imported  from  India,  but  during  that
period the most distinctive of them came from the East - the  present  Java,
Bali, Timor, Malaysia and  China.  By  1748  there  were  more  slaves  than
Europeans in the Cape. The  influence  on  farms,  factories,  the  building
industry, the clothing industry and in the greater  majority  of  households
cannot be determined.

The  one  monument  of  the  merging  of  the  erstwhile  brown  and   white
communities in the Cape is  the  Afrikaans  language.  The  phenomenon  that
Afrikaans, formerly known  as  kitchen  Dutch,  was  once  regarded  as  the
language of the  oppressor  was  a  deviation  rather  than  the  norm.  The
Afrikaans language was written by language militants, but  also  because  it
had become the practical medium of communication between slave  masters  and
slaves, and between slaves from different parts of  the  world.  During  the
eighties Afrikaans was also the language of resistance in the Western Cape.

Therefore, the origin of Afrikaans does not lie in the highest  chambers  of
the country. The origin of Afrikaans lies in the hearts and on  the  tongues
of people from all walks of society. After the chains of  slavery  had  been
broken in 1834,  the  white  and  brown  communities  in  the  Western  Cape
naturally grew closer together owing to ties of  blood,  religion,  language
and culture. Because  language  is  so  vitally  important  to  us  in  this
province, I want to talk to you on this  occasion  about  the  establishment
and activities of the Western Cape Language Committee.

This committee was established in  terms  of  the  Western  Cape  provincial
language legislation of 1998 and Council Notice 120 of 1997 -  as  published
in the  Government  Gazette  dated  15  December  1997.  The  committee  was
subsequently recognised as the Provincial Language Committee of the  Western
Cape, in terms of the Pan South African Language Board Act, 1995.

This means that the Language Committee is a statutory body  of  the  Western
Cape provincial government, as well as a provincial  language  committee  of
PanSALB. The Language Committee is accountable to  the  provincial  Minister
of cultural affairs, sport and recreation.

The Language Committee's vision is to empower all the people of the  Western
Cape by means of language, to strengthen their dignity  by  way  of  respect
for one other's language and  by  promoting  multilingualism.  The  Language
Committee's  mission  is  to  play  an  active  role  in  the  promotion  of
multilingualism in the province, to monitor the equal  usage  of  the  three
official languages in the province and to support  the  development  of  the
previously marginalised indigenous languages of the Western Cape.

The Western Cape Language  Committee  has  a  mandate  from  the  provincial
government to monitor the  use  of  Afrikaans,  English  and  Xhosa  in  the
provincial government. A  market  research  agency  has  been  appointed  to
undertake an extensive survey of the language usage and preferences  of  the
provincial government and its clients. This pioneering work,  the  first  of
its kind in South Africa, was finalised at the end of March 2002.

One of the most  important  findings  -  and  I  associate  myself  with  my
colleague who has just spoken - was that there was a sharp  decline  in  the
use of Afrikaans in the provincial government  in  favour  of  English;  and
that while 66% of the officials are Afrikaans-speaking.  The  latter  figure
correlates with the 59% of Afrikaans-speaking people in our province.
There is in fact some growth in the use of Xhosa,  but  this  must  be  seen
against the background of  the  serious  marginalisation  of  the  language.
Afrikaans-speaking and Xhosa-speaking  people  use  English  as  a  bridging
language  in  especially  internal  written  communication.   There   is   a
misleading positive acceptance of this state  of  affairs  among  Afrikaans-
speaking people, but fortunately we do not find the  same  acceptance  among
Xhosa-speaking people. However, it remains an elite solution to use  English
by default. A change of mind is necessary in the provincial government,  and
Afrikaans-speaking and Xhosa-speaking people should take a bolder  stand  as
regards the use of their languages.

I can say a lot more, but I do not  want  to  exceed  my  time.  I  want  to
conclude by saying thank you very much for the opportunity to  address  this
House. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you very much, hon member.]

Mrs M MASHANGOANE: Hon Chairperson, hon members, ladies  and  gentlemen,  we
are a nation that is so fortunate, for we are  a  nation  rich  in  culture.
Culture is a very important part of any society. Culture is identity. It  is
one's esteem and is one's home.

In South Africa we do not only have one culture but a diversity of  cultures
that make but one rich nation. We have a home and an identity.  We  are  not
only a diversity but we are one nation,  a  South  African  nation  that  is
proud to be South African and that is proud of its cultural heritage.

I can compare the beauty of our nation to that of a  rainbow.  The  question
is, what makes a rainbow beautiful? It is  a  combination  of  colours  that
make one beautiful rainbow. That is South Africa, our nation and our  pride.
Hence, our former hon President Nelson Mandela refers to  our  nation  as  a
rainbow nation, for we are.

Yes, we come from a terrible past where our culture were used as a  tool  to
divide our people and our  nation.  It  was  a  symbol  of  oppression.  The
diverse colours  of  our  skins  and  our  cultural  backgrounds  determined
whether we should be rightful  citizens  of  this  country  and  whether  we
deserved  to  be  respected  and  whether  we  should  enjoy  our  freedoms,
opportunities and our country. For if one fell in the so-called  wrong  side
of origin, colour and race, one was a foreigner and a  slave  in  one's  own
country.

But today we are speaking a different  language,  a  language  of  unity  in
diversity. Thanks to the struggles of our people  and  our  government,  the
government of the people, that today we can look around us  and  say  boldly
that we are proud to be South Africans. We are proud  of  our  heritage.  We
are a united force. We are  cradle  of  civilisation.  To  us,  our  diverse
heritage and our liberation are a passage to a  free  society.  They  affirm
human dignity. They outline how the world should march forward.

Instead of campaigning for wars, as a global village  the  world  should  be
following our example, for we are trendsetters, an example and  unique  even
in the way we obtained our liberation. No wars were fought  for  we  believe
in peace, unity and reconciliation.

Next week, on 24 September, we will be celebrating  our  South  Africanness.
We will also be celebrating our Africanness for we are part  and  parcel  of
Africa, hence the hon President always refers to  the  African  Renaissance.
We will be celebrating the beauty of our natural  heritage,  the  beauty  of
the Drakensberg Mountains in Kwazulu-Natal, of the  Table  Mountain  in  the
Western Cape and of God's Window in Mpumalanga. The beauty that crosses  all
our provinces.

We will be celebrating  both  our  tangible  and  intangible  heritage,  the
tangible heritage being the ones that relate  to  those  sites,  places  and
structures which are physical manifestations  of  our  shared  history.  The
intangible aspects being the ones that we refer to as our  diverse  customs,
indigenous knowledge and belief systems, traditions and mores  of  the  past
which are manifested through dance, certain rituals, oral  traditions,  ways
of doing things and songs. That is our nation.

Our very own  Robben  Island,  which  not  so  long  ago  was  a  symbol  of
oppression, is today a symbol of hope, reconciliation and  unity.  It  is  a
symbol of a way forward and of a united South  Africa  whose  future  is  so
bright that I need sunglasses. Our ambitious  project,  the  development  of
Freedom Park, will see the creation of a dedicated precinct celebrating  our
outstanding heritage, a centre of  knowledge  aimed  at  creating  a  deeper
understanding of South Africa and its people. It  will  become  a  place  of
inspiration for South Africans and  will  be  an  acknowledgement  of  South
Africa's  true  history,  a  chronicle  of  its  entire   people   and   its
contribution to humanity.

It will be a constant affirmation of national  identity  and  values  and  a
celebration of triumph of humanity, which was realised with the  achievement
of democracy in 1994. This is the present and the future of South Africa.

To conclude, I would like us as a nation to celebrate our  heritage  and  to
bring back what was taken from us, our dignity, identity and esteem. Let  us
celebrate the discovery of our pride in  ourselves.  Let  us  celebrate  our
South Africanness. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson  and  hon  fellow  South  Africans,  any  country's
cultural   resources,   buildings,    landscapes,    archaelogical    sites,
ethnographic resources, objects  and  documents,  structures  and  districts
embody a rich heritage of human experiences and  cultural  identities.  They
provide information about people  from  the  past  and  establish  important
connections to the present.

They tell a compelling story of our earlier  pioneers  and  communities  and
help us understand how we got where  we  are  today.  A  country's  cultural
resources must be carefully identified, evaluated,  documented,  registered,
preserved and interpreted. We become the veritable caretakers and  guardians
of these resources.

The new South Africa that was ushered in April 1994 switched on  fluorescent
lights on much of these  cultural  resources  which  had  been  deliberately
relegated  to  the  limbo  of  forgotten  things  not  because  they  lacked
intrinsic worth,  but  only  because  the  imperatives  of  a  race-obsessed
ideology of apartheid demanded selective amnesia.

During the apartheid era, the entire life and destiny  of  every  people  in
South  Africa  was  determined  by  an  artificial  arbitrary  and   totally
unscientific system of race classification. However, let me  not  dwell  too
much  on  such  negative  considerations  and  rather  on  celebrating   our
heritage. Did we not, only weeks ago, celebrate the return  of  our  beloved
Saartjie Baartman to her beloved homeland? Did we not,  even  after  some  2
centuries, rescue her, retrieve her from the ignominy of being an object  of
obscene curiosity in some foreign European capital as some human freak?  Did
we not embrace her in spirit and lower  her  remains  in  the  African  soil
under the African sun? In one fell swoop, did we not restore  and  celebrate
the status of women in South African society?

Only last  week  during  our  visits  to  nodal  points  in  our  respective
provinces, I was reminded about  the  importance  of  the  heritage  of  our
earlier political leaders when we visited the Dube Memorial  at  Ohlange  in
Inanda on the outskirts of Durban, incidentally not far from where I live.
John Langalibalele Dube was the first President-General of the ANC.  He  was
also a scholar, gentleman, leader, farmer, teacher, politician, patriot  and
philanthropist. Reverend John Dube established  the  Ohlange  Institute,  on
the lines of Tuskegee Institute, the  noted  Afro-American  institution.  He
was immensely influenced by Booker T Washington. It is interesting  to  note
that the famous Ohlange institute is only a stone's throw, no pun  intended,
from the Phoenix settlement  where  Mahatma  Gandhi,  another  world  famous
philosopher and practitioner of  non-violence  or  satyagraha,  founded  the
newspaper Indian Opinion.

Professor Dube also founded the  Zulu/English  newspaper  Ilanga  laseNatal,
which is prominent in my province even today. Nearby Ohlange  Institute,  in
the dense congregation of the AmaNazarene, the famous  Shembe  church.  That
the Unincity of Durban, Ethekwini, is rich in cultural heritage, indeed  the
province of KwaZulu-Natal, is really an understatement.

In celebrating our heritage from an international and national  perspective,
we must thank providence for  the  host  of  natural  resources  that  South
Africa has been endowed with. I am thinking of  our  dams  and  rivers,  our
forests, game parks, our fauna and flora, even our  mountains,  as  the  hon
King referred to the beautiful mountains of South Africa. Like  the  English
poets William Wordsworth and Gerald Manley Hopkins, I also  am  a  lover  of
nature because I easily see God's grandeur in nature.

Humans have a bad habit of taking things  for  granted.  We  feel  deprived,
neglected, unwanted, shunned and  alienated.  But,  if  one  can  pause  and
reflect on the myriad of blessings we should really not complain. One  thing
we cannot erase from our minds, whatever blessings we may  enjoy  today,  is
the direct result of the sacrifices that our parents have made.

I cannot complete my speech without  reference  to  the  rich  heritage  and
legacy that women in the  struggle  for  human  rights  have  made  in  this
country. I would like to mention a few by starting with Mama Bertha  Mkhize,
another luminary from Inanda, who was one of the  first  women  involved  in
the struggle for women's rights. Incidentally,  she  was  also  one  of  the
first women to have her own business in  KwaZulu-Natal.  Bertha  Mkhize  was
one of the first students to attend the  Inanda  Seminary  Secondary  School
for Girls and later she attended the Ohlange Institute. She  was  a  teacher
before she became a tailor.  Sometimes  some  teachers  also  have  restless
souls and they never remain in teaching for long.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I  am  afraid  your  time  has  expired.
[Applause.] As the hon Raju was speaking of the  history  of  women,  I  had
great difficulty exercising the duties that I am required  to  and  to  stop
him. [Laughter.] Unfortunately I have to give in.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, in discussing the issue of heritage  in  South
Africa, it should be noted that prior to the advent of democratic rule,  the
issue of heritage was inextricably bound to racial and cultural  exclusivity
and was also dominated by a eurocentric approach.  Since  the  awakening  of
South  Africa's  political  transformation,  the  diversity  of  our  multi-
cultural heritage has been acknowledged and increasingly celebrated, as  has
our hitherto ignored and neglected African heritage.

A number of heritage projects have  been  launched  in  recent  years  which
attempted to address the distortions and gaps  in  past  representations  of
heritage, but  much  still  remains  to  be  done  if  South  Africa  is  to
rediscover her cultural heritage and acknowledge her common identity.

The envisaged establishment of the Freedom Park on a 35-hectare site on  the
outskirts of  the  national  capital  of  Tshwane  would  see  South  Africa
boasting a world-class precinct comprising of a national  museum,  memorial,
garden of remembrance, amphitheatre  and  commercial  facilities.  One  good
thing about Freedom Park would be to bring  the  different  national  groups
together in celebration and do away with the present system where one  group
is not interested in what the next group is celebrating  because  the  event
being celebrated is in conflict with the interest and historical  background
of the other group.

South Africa's rich heritage is not limited  to  its  land  only,  but  also
includes its peoples and the  languages  they  speak.  Over  and  above  the
country's  eleven  official  languages,  we  have  inherited  some  of   the
following other languages: Firstly, Fanagalo,  a  well-known  language  used
mainly in the mines and for commercial purposes; secondly,  "Tsotsitaal"  or
"Flaaitaal", which uses a variety of Afrikaans, English and  African  words.
This language originated in the gold mines and was spoken  until  about  the
1980s. I am a speaker of that language. [Interjections.]

As a nation, South Africa  is  currently  in  the  midst  of  a  process  of
cultural rediscovery and renewal which will  ultimately  contribute  to  the
restoration and recognition of the links between its national  heritage  and
those at regional and continental level. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Heita  Mr  Tlhagale,  heita.  [Well  done  Mr
Tlhagale, well done.] [Laughter.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, as we are preparing  to  join  our  people  next
week, it is important for us to go through this kind of exercise  to  remind
ourselves that South  Africans,  especially  those  who  were  disadvantaged
under the previous dispensation, are  now  in  a  position  where  they  can
finally acknowledge with pride where  they  came  from  and  how  they  were
shaped by their destiny. Before, to speak one's mother tongue  had  numerous
negative connotations and to  practice  one's  traditions  labelled  one  as
backward and ignorant.

The most recent discourse by the Department of Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology, in a draft White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage,  seeks  to
find  through   policy   frameworks   optimum   funding   arrangements   and
institutional frameworks for  the  creation,  promotion  and  protection  of
practitioners of South African arts, culture and heritage.

This demonstrates the  Government's  seriousness  in  the  preservation  and
protection of our  heritage.  We  therefore  find  ourselves  as  Government
uniquely placed to legislate policies  and  frameworks  that  will  actively
seek to preserve for posterity every aspect of our  heritage  that  we  deem
necessary.

We have found that to legislate for transformation is vital  when  it  comes
to the preservation of our collective heritage. If we look, for example,  at
what in the past constituted a "monument", then we find that  not  only  was
the definition very narrow, but it was also distinctly  balanced  in  favour
of the white culture and its practices. Today the term "heritage  resources"
is preferred to "monuments" and these  include  places  of  natural  beauty,
buildings,  streets,   landscapes,   objects   of   historical   importance,
geological, palaeontological and  archaeological  sites  and  objects,  rock
art, shipwrecks and graves of historical figures and victims of conflict.

One of the more recent ways in which we have already begun to  preserve  our
culture and heritage was encapsulated in our debate  for  Women's  Day  this
year. This Council debated the significance of  the  violation  of  our  own
Sarah Baartman under  the  title:  "Sarah  Baartman:  An  Epitome  of  Human
Dignity against a Background  of  Gender  and  Racial  Discrimination".  The
whole point of the debate found its context in the horrific abuses that  one
of our own was subjected to in a foreign country, primarily because she  did
not fit the "norm" as dictated  by  the  European  interpretation  of  human
beings. She was therefore both a live exhibit during her lifetime,  as  well
as a museum curiosity after her death for the  gawking,  ignorant  Europeans
of the late 1800's until 1975.

We rallied together as a  nation,  despite  coming  from  diverse  cultures,
firstly to bring her back to her place of birth  and  secondly  to  restore,
posthumously, her dignity. I believe the ceremony that was broadcast  widely
on television moved all of us in a very profound way and at  the  same  time
brought us closer to the Khoi tradition and language.

As  Government,  we  have  transformed  our  national  monuments,   national
heritage sites and all Government-controlled aspects of the preservation  of
our heritage so that these now reflect our rich and diverse  cultures.  Most
other NGO's and academic institutions are also  getting  involved  with  the
preservation of our heritage. An example of this happened the other  day  at
UCT and in the Eastern Cape with the 25th  anniversary  celebration  of  the
death of Comrade Steve Biko. Who would  have  thought,  25  years  ago  when
Comrade Steve died at the hands of security police on that  fateful  day  in
September 1997, that we would celebrate the death in  detention  of  one  of
our stalwarts of the liberation struggle?

Chinua Achebe, who was invited  to  the  University  of  Cape  Town  on  the
occasion of the Steve Biko memorial lecture, recalled  Steve's  warnings  to
"cast off the burden of inferiority imposed by the  agents  of  oppression."
Young people who were present at the lecture commented  on  the  significant
role Biko played in South Africa's history, as articulated at  the  lecture,
that it made them proud of  him  and,  simultaneously,  proud  to  be  South
Africans. Achebe also paid tribute to Nelson Mandela  for  being  the  great
president that he  was  and  also  for  stepping  down  as  president  on  a
continent where presidents for life are more often than not the norm.

It is this sense of patriotism and nation-building  that  we  need  to  keep
alive as a nation, for our children and any future  generations.  Especially
significant in  this  regard  were  the  warnings  made  by  Xolela  Mangcu,
director of the Steve Biko  Foundation,  when  he  said:  "Too  often  those
living in freedom become too blasé." Indeed, we need to document and put  on
record, through whatever means,  our  rich  national  heritage  so  that  it
becomes relevant to every generation.

Provinces need only look in their own backyards to identify  people,  events
or sites that have contributed to building this nation into  the  formidable
force it is today, both on the continent and in the world. We have a lot  of
people who contributed significantly  to  our  history.  Some  of  them  are
forgotten heroes. We need to go back to our Provinces and take  a  look.  We
must bring those names back to life.

We had our first World Summit on Sustainable  Development  that  took  place
recently in Gauteng and all the positive aspects that are spin-offs  in  the
landscape of our country. In the Western Cape alone we have  Robben  Island,
which is now not only a symbol of our nation's freedom,  but  also  a  World
Heritage Site.

Madiba is a symbol of our biggest success story in South  Africa's  peaceful
transition from apartheid to democracy. Even Oprah  Winfrey  was  forced  to
concede that it is our concept of community, unity and  nationhood  that  is
central in the preservation of our heritage, rather than  the  contributions
of the individual in their personal capacity.  Madiba  had  to  remind  her,
during a show devoted entirely to him, that he was but one  person  who  was
part of the collective to change a  society  from  apartheid  to  democracy.
History will record his role as such. Our nation  is  nonetheless  proud  of
his contribution to making  South  Africa  a  place  where  the  fundamental
principles of nonracialism, nonsexism, tolerance, equality and  freedom  are
upheld and revered by everyone.

South Africa is also very  concerned  about  our  natural  heritage,  unlike
other nations where regard for the environment does  not  form  an  integral
part of national heritage. Recent coverage of the broken  down  tanker  that
is currently threatening our St. Lucia Estuary, a  national  heritage  site,
has  elicited  widespread  messages  of  concern  and   support   from   all
stakeholders, including Government. Everyone is waiting  with  bated  breath
to check the environmental  consequences  on  such  a  sensitive  ecosystem.
Environmental issues are usually  confined  to  the  back  burner  in  other
developing and developed countries. South Africa is leading the way here  as
well.

We have learned as a nation about building our continent.  Initiatives  such
as Nepad, the AU and the African Renaissance concept  are  all  attempts  to
put South Africa and Africa  firmly  on  the  agendas  of  the  First  World
countries. These attempts are geared  towards  taking  back  our  continent,
consolidating our resources and demanding that we  play  a  more  meaningful
role in the development of world politics and sustainable development.
We have many important people, sites  and  other  instruments  that  record,
remember and preserve for today and the future. One person  who  stands  out
in one's mind is Chief Luthuli, who was born  in  1898,  Nobel  Peace  Prize
winner and much revered fourth President of the African  National  Congress.
In a speech at a public meeting organised by the South African  Congress  of
Democrats in Johannesburg in 1958, he touched on the issue  of  heritage  by
saying:


  My  fellow  white  South  Africans,  enjoying  what  is  called  "Western
  civilisation", should be the first to agree  that  this  civilisation  is
  indebted to previous civilisations, from the East, from Greece, Rome  and
  so on. For its heritage, Western civilisation is really indebted to  very
  many sources, both ancient and modern.

Later in the same speech he said:


  We often hear the cry that if we extend democratic freedom to  non-whites
  we shall be surrendering our heritage. But I would like to  suggest  that
  you cannot preserve your heritage by isolating yourself ...

[Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! On  what  point
are you rising, hon member?

Mr  N  M  RAJU:  Chairperson,  will  the  hon  Kgware   take   a   question?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I  cannot  hear
when everybody is speaking. Will the hon member take a question?

Mr  D  M  KGWARE:  No,  Mr  Chairperson.  I  would  just  like  to   finish.
[Interjections.] By isolating other people ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon  Kgware,  I
gave you two minutes more, thinking you will finish. You have not  finished.
[Applause.]

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
                AFFAIRS - EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON EXTRADITION

Mr P A MATTHEE: Mr Chairperson, during May 1996 the  Department  of  Foreign
Affairs was requested to inform the Council  of  Europe  of  South  Africa's
wish to accede to the Council of Europe's Convention on Extradition  and  to
take the necessary steps to negotiate an invitation.

Article 30 of this convention provides as follows:


  The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any  state
  not a member of the Council to accede to the  Convention,  provided  that
  the  resolution  containing  such  invitation  receives   the   unanimous
  agreement of the members of the Council who have ratified the Convention.
  Accession shall be by a deposit with the Secretary-General of the Council
  of an instrument of accession which shall take effect 90 days  after  the
  date of its deposit.

The Committee of  Ministers  of  the  Council  of  Europe,  at  their  660th
meeting, decided to  invite  South  Africa  to  accede  to  the  convention.
Article 26 of the convention provides that -


  ... any contracting party  may,  when  signing  the  Convention  or  when
  depositing  its  instrument  of  ratification  or   accession,   make   a
  reservation in respect of any provisions of the Convention.

It further states that -


  ... any contracting party which has made a reservation shall withdraw  it
  as soon as circumstances permit.

Article 28 of the convention provides that -


  ... in respect of those countries to which  it  applies,  the  Convention
  shall  supersede  any  bilateral  agreements,  treaties  or   conventions
  governing extradition between any contracting parties.  However,  parties
  may conclude between themselves bilateral agreements which supplement  or
  facilitate the implementation of the Convention.

The effect of accession, therefore, would be to replace  existing  bilateral
agreements between South Africa and any of  the  contracting  parties  under
the convention. At the same time it would  obviate  the  need  to  negotiate
separate bilateral  agreements  with  the  individual  contracting  parties,
except insofar as such agreements would be to supplement or  facilitate  the
implementation of the convention.

Article 28(3) further provides that -


  ... this arrangement would not adversely affect any arrangement in  terms
  of which extradition takes place on the basis of a uniform law.

Thus,  for  example,  if  the  SADC  were  to  develop  a  uniform  law   on
extradition, the convention would not affect the  application  of  that  law
between the contracting parties, unless the parties  themselves  decided  to
exclude its application.

As the convention allows a state at the time of  ratification  or  accession
to make reservations and to make declarations in terms of the provisions  of
the convention, the committee, as hon members will note from its  report  in
the ATC of 17 September, recommends to this Council that this convention  be
approved, but with the declaration that,  firstly,  the  Republic  of  South
Africa, for  the  purposes  of  article  2  of  the  convention,  shall  not
extradite any person unless the  punishment  awarded  for  a  conviction  in
respect of which he or she is being sought is a sentence of imprisonment  of
at least six months.

Secondly, we say that the declaration should be that  for  the  purposes  of
article 6 of the convention the term ``nationals'' is defined  in  terms  of
South Africa's legal system as  persons  who  have  acquired  South  African
citizenship  by  means  of  birth,  descent  or  naturalisation,  that  this
includes persons with citizenship of South Africa and  of  another  country.
These  persons  will  all  be  liable  to  be  extradited.  South   Africa's
acceptance of dual citizenship will therefore not bar the extradition  of  a
person who is also in possession of  the  citizenship  of  a  country  which
prohibits the extradition of its nationals. With those two  declarations  we
recommend to this Council that this convention be approved. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I wish to  take
this opportunity to acknowledge the presence in the gallery  of  members  of
the SA National Defence Force College, who are paying  Parliament  a  visit.
We welcome them and we hope they will enjoy their stay here. [Applause.]

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  members,
we always have some mischievous persons in the Chamber. [Laughter.] It is  a
pity that today it is one of the Whips. I just want to ask the hon  Whip  Mr
Sulliman not to vote when he is not called upon to do so. [Interjections.]

Mr M A Sulliman: [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Thank you,  but
then you must take charge of your affairs, otherwise other people will  take
over.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.
 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
     AFFAIRS - ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL TO EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON EXTRADITION

Mr L G  LEVER:  Chairperson,  this  additional  protocol  amplifies  certain
definitions, terms and provisions of the European Convention that  has  just
been voted on in this House. It excludes from the  definition  of  political
offences  crimes  against  humanity  specified  in  the  convention  on  the
protocols and punishment of the crime of genocide  as  well  as  crimes  for
maltreatment of wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of the armed forces.

Further, under Chapter 2, under certain conditions extradition will  not  be
allowed where the person who is the subject  of  the  application  has  been
convicted and has already served a sentence in a  third  country.  The  main
exception being if that person holds a public office.

In Chapter 3 the remaining  provisions  of  the  convention  deal  with  the
formal aspects of  acceding  to  and  ratifying  this  convention.  A  state
acceding to the convention referred to  is  referred  to  as  a  contracting
party to the convention. On acceding to  this  convention,  any  contracting
state may make a declaration qualifying certain aspects of this  convention.
The provisions of this convention are standard to  this  type  of  political
and diplomatic document.

The select committee feels that as a member of the wider family  of  nations
there is a  great  deal  of  benefit  and  advantage  to  acceding  to  this
additional protocol and consequently the select committee urges  this  House
to ratify and adopt the Additional Protocol to the  European  Convention  on
Extradition.

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
 AFFAIRS ON SECOND ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL TO EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON EXTRADITION

Ms B N DLULANE: Mr  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  the  second  additional
protocol  is  designed  to  facilitate  the  application  of  the   European
Convention on Extradition on several points  and  aims,  in  particular,  to
include fiscal offences among the category of offences for  which  a  person
may  be  extradited  under  the  convention.  This  protocol  also  contains
additional  provisions  which  relate  to   the   extension   of   accessory
extradition to offences  carrying  only  pecuniary  sanction,  judgments  in
absentia, amnesty as well as the communication of requests for  extradition.


The laws of other countries draw a  distinction  between  criminal  offences
properly called as such and certain other types of offences. While  criminal
offences are punishable by criminal penalties, the other offences are  dealt
with by pecuniary sanctions, which are not regarded  as  criminal  penalties
as is the case here in South Africa.

Under the convention,  minor  criminal  offences  which  carry  only  fines,
cannot give rise to accessory extradition  since  they  do  not  fulfil  the
specified conditions regarding the nature of the sanction. Nonetheless,  the
offences may cause considerable  social  harm,  for  example,  violation  of
regulations relating to the protection of the environment. It was  therefore
thought desirable to include them all in the category of  the  offences  for
which  accessory  extradition  can  be  granted,  particularly   since   the
seriousness of the offence is normally a condition of extradition  and  does
not give rise to concern in the case of accessory extradition.

Article 5 of the convention provides that extradition for  fiscal  offences,
ie offences in connection with taxes, duties, customs and exchange shall  be
granted only if the contracting parties have so decided in  respect  of  any
such offences or category of offences. Chapter  II  of  the  protocol  gives
article 5 of  the  convention  a  more  mandatory  form.  It  provides  that
extradition shall take place irrespective of any  arrangements  between  the
contracting parties whenever the  fiscal  offence,  under  the  law  of  the
requesting state, corresponds under the law of the requested  state,  to  an
offence of the same nature.

This new rules reflects the strong sentiments that  fiscal  offences  should
not be treated as ordinary  offences  as  they  were  akin  to  military  or
political offences, which traditionally did not give  rise  to  extradition.
This means that,  for  the  purpose  of  extradition,  fiscal  and  ordinary
offences are on the same footing.

Chapter 111 complements the European Convention on Extradition  with  regard
to judgements in absentia, ie judgements rendered after a hearing  at  which
the sentenced person was not personally present. The judgements in  absentia
resolution recommends that the governments of member states apply  a  number
of minimum rules when a trial is held in the absence of the  accused.  These
minimum rules are aimed at guaranteeing the accused rights as laid  down  in
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights  and  Fundamental
Freedoms and may serve the purpose of determining the scope  of  the  phrase
``rights of defence'', as used in Chapter III.

Chapter IV deals with  the  question  whether  an  amnesty  granted  in  the
requested state is  ground  for  refusing  extradition.  The  convention  is
silent on this point. The protocol now offers a solution. This chapter  does
not  deal  with  amnesty  in  the  requesting  party  as  the   subcommittee
considered it unlikely that  a  state  would  ask  for  extradition  for  an
offence in respect of which it had previously granted  amnesty.  An  amnesty
in the requested party is a barrier to extradition only if  that  state  has
jurisdiction over the offence concurrently with  the  requested  state,  for
example, by virtue of the principle of active and passive personality.

According to article 12.1 of the convention, requests  for  extradition  are
communicated through the diplomatic  channels.  Experience  in  some  states
have shown that diplomatic channels may give rise to  delay.  This  protocol
provides for extradition requests to be communicated between  the  Ministers
of justice concerned without,  however,  excluding  the  use  of  diplomatic
channels and allowing two or more contracting parties  to  resort  to  other
specifically agreed channels. I therefore support the ratification  of  this
protocol in its entirety. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
                 AFFAIRS - SADC PROTOCOL AGAINST CORRUPTION

Mrs E N LUBIDLA:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  corruption  in  the  Southern
African region is of  particular  concern  because  it  undermines  emerging
political  and  economic  institutions  and  threatens  the  political   and
economic reforms which we are trying to achieve through Nepad.

Corruption has a debilitating impact on the quality of  life  of  people  in
the region,  particularly  the  poor  because  it  results  in  fewer  funds
allocated to government  programmes  in  education,  health  care,  housing,
physical infrastructure such as water, sanitary  systems,  roads  and  other
social services.

The fight against corruption  is  a  top  priority  for  the  South  African
Government. Our President has time and again reiterated  the  commitment  of
the  South  African  Government  to  honest,  transparent  and   accountable
government and the Government's determination to  act  against  anybody  who
transgresses these norms.

Since 1994 the  South  African  Government  has  developed  a  comprehensive
programme against corruption. The  programme  includes  the  improvement  of
investigation  and  prosecution  of  corruption,  the   rationalisation   of
agencies combating corruption, a review of relevant  legislation  and  steps
to improve financial management systems and  discipline  at  all  levels  of
government.

Other   initiatives   around   corruption   have   focused   on    promotion
accountability, transparency and the rule  of  law,  the  practice  of  good
governance, a free press to forcefully  report  to  the  public  on  corrupt
practices and the strengthening of Government watchdog agencies to  identify
corrupt practices and bring them to public attention.

New steps have also been taken to ensure the  enforcement  of  the  Code  of
Conduct for Public Servants. The Prevention of Corruption Bill has  recently
been introduced to further strengthen  the  fight  against  corruption.  All
these initiatives show Government's commitment to counter corruption.
The SADC Protocol against Corruption is long overdue, and the  countries  of
the SADC are to be congratulated on the initiative  which  will  undoubtedly
have far-reaching effects on regional efforts to  fight  corruption  in  our
SADC countries.

The protocol has been carefully thought through and is more than capable  of
delivering  its  expected  outcomes.  It  focuses  on  those   elements   of
governance that matter, such as developing  and  strengthening  institutions
needed to prevent, detect, punish and eradicate  corruption  and  developing
efficient, effective and  transparent  systems  and  procedures  for  public
administration.

The  purpose  of  the  protocol  is  threefold.  Firstly  to   promote   the
development of anticorruption mechanisms at the national level, secondly  to
promote co-operation in the fight against corruption by state  parties  and,
thirdly, to harmonise anticorruption national  legislation  in  the  region.
The protocol also provides a wide  set  of  preventative  mechanisms,  which
include the following: Development of code of conduct for public  officials;
transparency in public procurement of goods and  services,  easy  access  to
public  information,  protection  of  whistle  blowers;   establishment   of
anticorruption agencies; developed systems of accountability  and  controls;
participation of the media and civil society; and use  of  public  education
and awareness as a way of introducing zero tolerance for corruption.

Article 6 of the protocol criminalises the  bribery  of  foreign  officials.
The protocol also addresses the issue of proceeds of crime by  allowing  for
their confiscation and seizure, thereby making it more difficult to  benefit
from proceeds of corruption. It makes corruption  or  any  of  the  offences
under it an extraditable offence, making it difficult for criminals to  have
a haven in one of the SADC countries. More so, the protocol can be  a  legal
basis for extradition in the absence of a bilateral extradition treaty.  The
SADC Protocol also provides for judicial co-operation and  legal  assistance
among state parties. This is important as  corruption  often  involves  more
than one country.

In terms of its implementation, the protocol establishes a  committee  which
will have the responsibility for gathering and disseminating information  on
corruption among member states, organising training programmes as  and  when
appropriate, putting into practice a  programme  of  implementation  of  the
protocol  and  providing  technical  assistance  to  state   parties   where
necessary.

Lastly, corruption is not inevitable, neither is it  limited  to  particular
countries.  It  transcends  political  and  geographical   boundaries.   Co-
operation among the different countries of the Southern  African  region  is
therefore essential  if  we  are  to  minimise  the  negative  impact  which
corruption has on the social and economic  development  of  the  region.  We
therefore need to give this protocol our unreserved endorsement.

Debate concluded.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
            AFFAIRS - PROTOCOL ON DEVELOPMENT OF TOURISM IN SADC

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chairperson, hon members, the  Protocol  on  Development  of
Tourism in the SADC was signed by the heads of states in  Mauritius  on  the
14 September 1998 with the exception of Angola, which was  involved  in  the
internal war. According to the constitutional procedures, for this  protocol
to come into effect two thirds or nine, of the  member  states  must  ratify
it.  Eight  countries  have   already   deposited   their   instruments   of
ratification with the secretariat.

One more ratification makes this protocol operational  and  binding  on  all
member states and those that have not ratified it, will have  to  accede  to
the protocol. Therefore, adopting  this  protocol  today  will  place  South
Africa amongst those countries that are ratifying  it  and  the  two  thirds
constitutional requirement will be met.

The objectives of this protocol are as follows: To use tourism as a  vehicle
to achieve sustainable social and  economic  development  through  the  full
realisation of its potential for the region; to  ensure  equitable  balanced
and complementary  development  of  the  tourism  industry  region-wide;  to
optimise resource usage and increase competitive advantage  in  the  region,
vis-a-vis other destinations through collective effort and  co-operation  in
an environmentally sustainable manner; to ensure the  involvement  of  small
micro enterprises, local communities, women and youth in the development  of
tourism in the region; to contribute towards the human  development  of  the
region through job creation and the development of skills at all  levels  in
the tourism industry; to create a favourable investment climate for  tourism
within the region for both the public and private sectors,  including  small
and  medium-scale  tourism   establishments;   to   improve   the   quality,
competitiveness and standards of service of  the  tourism  industry  in  the
region; to improve the standards of safety and security for tourists in  the
territories  of  member  states  and  to  make  appropriate  provision   for
disabled, handicapped and senior citizens in their respective countries;  to
aggressively promote  the  region  as  a  single  but  multifaceted  tourism
destination capitalising  on  its  common  strengths  and  highlighting  the
unique tourist  attractions  of  individual  member  states;  to  facilitate
interregional travel for the development of tourism through  the  easing  or
removal of travel and visa restrictions  and  harmonisation  of  immigration
procedures; and to improve tourism service and infrastructure  in  order  to
foster a vibrant tourism industry.

In conclusion, tourism is already a strong and growing force in  Africa.  It
has enormous potential to create jobs, increase  wealth,  stimulate  exports
and to act as a catalyst for broad-scale social  and  economic  development.
African governments have recognised the far-reaching  potential  of  tourism
