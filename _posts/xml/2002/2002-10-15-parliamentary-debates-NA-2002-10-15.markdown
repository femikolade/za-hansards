                              NOTICES OF MOTION

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, a temporary sound  system  has  been
installed as you will remember that on our last  day  we  had  difficulties.
Eight floor microphones plus two roving  microphones  are  available,  apart
from the podium microphone which is fully operational.

Ms M M MAUNYE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on  behalf  of
the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with horror and dismay the barbaric killing of  more  than  182
       people in a bomb blast in the Indonesian resort island, Bali,  on  12
       October 2002;


  (2) further notes that this cowardly act is reminiscent of the killing of
       unarmed civilians in  Kenya,  Nairobi  and  the  World  Trade  Centre
       recently;


  (3) believes that terrorist actions against unarmed people  constitute  a
       cowardly act, and an inhuman act which must be condemned by all;


  (4) expresses sincere condolences to the relatives of the  deceased,  the
       people and the government of Indonesia;


  (5) wishes the injured speedy recovery; and


  (6) calls on the international community to ensure that incidents of this
       nature do not occur again.

[Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 1 409 DA councillors were elected in 2000 and that 612  of
       them were members of  the  New  NP  nominated  by  Mr  Marthinus  van
       Schalkwyk;


  (2) therefore notes with pleasure that only 228 of these councillors have
       turned their backs on the voters and rejected their mandate; and


  (3) further expresses the hope that the  rest  of  the  councillors  will
       resist the temptation of joining the ANC/New NP  alliance  in  return
       for jobs and perks, and that they will continue  providing  efficient
       and good government where the DA  is  in  power  and  principled  and
       effective opposition where it is not.

[Applause.]

Mr E J LUCAS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness and shock that at least 190 people were killed and
       hundreds more, including a South African, were injured after  a  bomb
       exploded on the Indonesian resort island of Bali;


  (2) offers its sincerest condolences to the families of the deceased  and
       hopes that all the injured make a full recovery;


  (3) strongly condemns such terrorist action and hopes that the  necessary
       steps are being taken to deal with it; and


  (4) urges all countries around the world to work  together  in  combating
       terrorism.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on  behalf
of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that three Pagad fugitives, Mogamat  Isaacs,  Faizel  Samsodien
       and Ebrahim Jeneker, have been rearrested;


  (2) congratulates members of the SAPS for  their  swift  action  in  this
       regard; and


  (3) calls on the communities to continue to work with  police  to  ensure
       safety and security in South Africa.

[Applause.]
Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice on behalf of the  New
NP that I shall move on the next sitting day of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that more than 300 DA councillors have already joined  the  New
       NP with many more to come before the end of the window period;


  (2) commends these councillors on their decision to play  a  constructive
       role in SA politics instead of merely fighting back;


  (3) furthermore notes that the DA, correctly described by  The  Economist
       of 12 October as a ``right-wing party'', has already lost control  of
       15 councils; and


  (4) especially notes that Stellenbosch, so triumphantly claimed by the DA
       as a DA stronghold, is the latest addition in this regard.

[Applause.] [Interjections.]

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on behalf  of
the UDM at the next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that tomorrow is World Food Day;


  (2) acknowledges the growing danger of large-scale hunger and  starvation
       throughout the Southern African region;


  (3) expresses its concern regarding the continuing rise in  food  prices,
       which brings closer with each passing day the spectre  of  starvation
       among the poor here in South Africa; and


  (4) calls upon Government immediately to institute a food stamp programme
       to  ensure  that  household  food  security  amongst  the   poor   is
       established and maintained.
Mrs C I LUDWABE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf
of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  with  sadness  the  untimely  death  of  South  Africa's  High
       Commissioner to Lesotho and an ANC veteran,  Comrade  Japhet  Ndlovu,
       last Saturday;


  (2) further notes the untimely death of Comrade Mary Mxadana  who  worked
       as a personal assistant to former President Nelson Mandela during his
       term of office;


  (3) expresses its sincere condolences to the families  of  the  deceased;
       and


  (4) mourns the untimely death of these patriots.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move  on
behalf of the ACDP at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that a 13-year-old girl, Lakita Fleur,  was  found
       dead on the railway track near her home in Uitsig  on  Sunday,  after
       she threw herself in front of an oncoming train in a suicide attempt;


  (2) further notes that this is a second child to be found dead  on  those
       railway lines in the past year;


  (3) also notes that the railway track is not fenced off and that it  runs
       through two informal settlements, less than 50 metres away from these
       children's homes, providing an extremely dangerous environment;


  (4) calls on Intercity immediately to fence off the area to  ensure  that
       no  more  children  will  fall  prey  to  venturing  into   dangerous
       unprotected areas;


  (5) calls on Government to put in place every  measure  and  resource  to
       ensure the safety of our children, and to make sure that  whoever  is
       responsible for the death of our future generations, be it a murderer
       or rapist, or the railway manager who did not ensure that the railway
       line  was  cordoned  off  from  children,  be  held  liable  for  the
       unnecessary loss of life; and


  (6) calls on Government to stand with the ACDP  in  sending  our  sincere
       condolences to the Fleur family.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mev die Speaker, hiermee  gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag van die Raad namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  'n  Afrikaanse  radiostasie  in  sy  oggend-aktualiteitsprogram,
           Monitor, tans 'n opname onder sy luisteraars maak om  te  bepaal
           of politici hoër morele waardes as prostitute het;


       (b)  dit 'n regstreekse reaksie is op die polities  immorele  oorloop
           van raadslede waardeur kiesers voel dat hulle verkiesingsmandaat
           geïgnoreer word en hulle stemme gesteel word,  en  wat  op  alle
           lede van hierdie Huis reflekteer;


       (c)  die Regering beplan  om  voort  te  gaan  en  wetgewing  in  die
           Parlement in te dien om dit moontlik te maak vir verkose lede op
           parlementêre en provinsiale vlak  om  na  ander  partye  te  kan
           oorloop; en


       (d)  die Grondwet  in  hierdie  geval  gewysig  sal  word  ten  einde
           politieke winste in KwaZulu-Natal en die  Wes-Kaap  moontlik  te
           maak om die vierparty-alliansie, naamlik die ANC, Nuwe NP,  SAKP
           en Cosatu, ter wille te wees; en


  (2) 'n beroep op die Regering doen  om  die  wense  van  die  kiesers  te
       respekteer en nie voort te gaan met  die  wetgewing  wat  oorloop  op
       parlementêre en provinsiale vlak moontlik sal maak nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

Dr P W A MULDER:  Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on
behalf of the ACDP at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  an Afrikaans radio station is currently making a survey  in  its
           morning actuality programme, Monitor, amongst its  listeners  to
           determine whether politicians  have  higher  moral  values  than
           prostitutes;


       (b)  this is a direct reaction to the  politically  immoral  crossing
           over of members which makes  voters  feel  that  their  election
           mandate is being  ignored  and  their  votes  stolen,  and  that
           reflects on all members of this House;


       (c)  the Government plans to proceed with introducing legislation  in
           Parliament  to  make  it  possible  for   elected   members   at
           parliamentary and  provincial  level  to  cross  over  to  other
           parties; and


       (d)  the  Constitution  will  be  amended  in  this  case  to  ensure
           political gains in KwaZulu-Natal and the Western  Cape  for  the
           four-party alliance, namely, the ANC, NNP, SACP and Cosatu; and


  (2) appeals to the Government to respect the wishes of the voters and not
       proceed  with  the  legislation  enabling  the   crossing   over   at
       parliamentary and provincial level.

Mrs L MALONEY: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on  behalf  of
the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the focus theme of the month of October is ``the rights  of  the
           child'';


       (b)  the ANC-led Government will increase  the  child  support  grant
           from R130,00 tot R140,00 and the fostercare grant  from  R450,00
           to R460,00; and


       (c)  the Government is considering phasing in  an  extension  of  the
           child support grant to 14 years of age;


  (2) believes that this reflects the commitment of the Government to fight
       poverty and to uphold the rights of the child; and


  (3) commends the Government for embarking on this bold step as this  will
       help to alleviate the poverty experienced by children.

[Applause.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay that the heart unit at Groote Schuur Hospital is in
       crisis, stemming directly from poor funding and mismanagement by  the
       provincial government headed by Mr Marthinus van Schalkwyk;


  (2) further notes that while Mr Van Schalkwyk and the ANC/New NP alliance
       are playing politics, the job of administering the  Western  Cape  is
       being neglected at the expense of people's lives; and


  (3) resolves to suggest to Mr Van  Schalkwyk  that  he  should  pay  more
       attention to the important job for which he is paid by the taxpayers.

[Applause.]
Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that National Marine Week, with the theme ``using the resources
       of our oceans and coasts in a sustainable way'', began on Monday,  14
       October 2002;


  (2) further notes that there are educational programmes and other  events
       being held around the country during the week;


  (3)  realises  that  on  Friday,  18  October  2002,  the  Department  of
       Environmental Affairs and Tourism will announce  which  beaches  will
       receive Blue Flag status, which  confirms  that  they  have  attained
       international  standards  on  safety,   environmental   and   tourist
       friendliness, cleanliness and visible security; and


  (4) hopes that National Marine Week will educate people and  raise  their
       awareness of the ocean and its resources and how to  use  them  in  a
       sustainable way.

Ms O R KASIENYANE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on  behalf
of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Government announced food relief measures for  the  poor  to
           help improve food security transparency in the food supply chain
           and price stability; and


       (b)  the Government has reached an agreement with  Premier  Foods  to
           provide a nonbranded 12,5 kg maize meal bag  to  be  sold  at  a
           subsidised price of R25,00 per bag;


  (2) believes that this reflects the commitment of the Government to fight
       poverty in the wake of a spiralling increase in food prices recently;
       and


  (3) welcomes the announcements made by the ANC-led Government to  improve
       food security.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall
move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the DP/DA's  pathetic  cries  of  ``stealing  the  vote'',  and
       ``betraying  the  voters'',  and  their   accusation   of   ``immoral
       councillors'', which serve only to highlight their own hypocrisy;


  (2) acknowledges that their sudden change of mind is not principled,  but
       based on the fact that they are on the receiving end;


  (3) also notes that -


       (a)  not only did the DP vote in favour of the defection legislation,
           but their Chief Whip, Douglas Gibson,  even  introduced  private
           member's legislation to provide for defections; and


       (b)  the DP themselves have a long track record of gleeful acceptance
           of defectors from other parties into their own ranks,  in  fact,
           the DP consists almost of defectors only, if one looks at  their
           MPs sitting over there; and


  (4) rejects with utter disgust the hon Leon's name-calling,  categorising
       councillors as being like ``computer viruses  and  cancers  that  you
       have to get rid of'', while the  one  or  two  councillors  who  have
       fallen for their misrepresentations are being welcomed as heroes.

What double standards!
Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf
of the UDM at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) acknowledges that it is the  duty  of  the  Government  not  only  to
       directly improve the lives of  South  Africans  through  its  various
       programmes and departments, but also through  the  effective  use  of
       resources to avoid wastage;


  (2) notes that we continue to live in a country where  millions  of  poor
       people are unemployed,  where  millions  are  illiterate,  and  where
       millions go to bed hungry every night;


  (3) expresses its disgust at and condemnation of the R986 000 a month  in
       rental fees that the Department of Public Works is currently  wasting
       by paying for 24 empty buildings; and


  (4) calls  upon  the  Minister  of  Public  Works  immediately  to  prove
       Government's  commitment  to  clean  and  effective  governance,   by
       addressing this utterly unacceptable situation.

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf  of
the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the destructive court ruling that current  legislation  in  the
       Child Care Act and the Guardianship Act infringes on the dignity  and
       equality of individuals and does not give  paramountcy  to  the  best
       interests of children, which perverts the definition of family;


  (2) acknowledges that the  global  agenda  to  deconstruct  marriage  and
       family  has  been  given  licence  in  South  Africa,   through   the
       Constitution, legislation like the Equality Act and proposals by  the
       SA Law Commission which further target marriage and  family  and  are
       strenuously backed by both the ANC and the DA;


  (3) recognises this court ruling  as  a  tragic  blow  to  South  African
       society and reiterates the ACDP  stand  for  family  values  and  the
       strengthening of the family unit, which is the basic  building  block
       of strong, healthy communities and a strong, healthy nation;


  (4) notes that according to statistics, children who grow up  in  single-
       sex parented homes are clearly disadvantaged and the consequences are
       often tragic;


  (5) calls on the Government, legislators and the judiciary to protect the
       time-honoured and noble institutions of marriage, family, motherhood,
       fatherhood and childhood which are under attack; and


  (6) calls on South Africans to reject this ...

                                  QUALIFIER

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the 2-0 victory of Bafana Bafana over Burundi in  Group  11  of
       the African Nations Cup 2004 qualifiers on Sunday;


  (2) recognises that captain André Arendse and the boys  put  up  a  solid
       performance;


  (3)  acknowledges  this  victory  has  taken  Bafana  Bafana  closer   to
       qualifying for the prestigious African soccer showpiece; and


  (4) congratulates coach Shakes Mashaba and his team  for  their  emphatic
       win over physically intimidating opponents on that day.

Agreed to.

           GOOD LUCK TO MATRIC PUPILS IN THEIR FINAL EXAMINATIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, I hereby move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) believes that a good school education is the foundation on which  our
       youth can build a successful future; and


  (2) wishes all the matric pupils good luck in their  final  examinations;
       and


  (3) hopes that these examinations progress without incident.

Agreed to.

                             BOMB BLAST IN BALI

                              (Daft Resolution)

Mnr C H F GREYLING: Mev die Speaker, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met skok en afgryse kennis neem van die bomontploffing in Bali waarin
       ongeveer 300 mense beseer is en wat reeds die lewens van ongeveer 182
       mense geëis het;


  (2) verder kennis neem dat 19 Suid-Afrikaners wat na  bewering  ten  tyde
       van die bomontploffing in Bali  was,  teen  Maandagmiddag  as  vermis
       aangegee is;


  (3) hierdie lafhartige, koelbloedige terreuraanval  op  onskuldige  mense
       ten sterkste veroordeel;


  (4) glo dat die nodige stappe gedoen sal word om die  skuldiges  aan  die
       pen te laat ry,  maar  ook  dat  die  internasionale  gemeenskap  sal
       saamstaan in die stryd om terrorisme uit te roei; en


  (5) sy innige meegevoel en simpatie betoon  aan  die  naasbestaandes  van
       diegene wat in die bomontploffing gesterf het.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows.)

[Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Speaker, I hereby move without notice:]


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and horror the bomb blast in Bali in which about 300
       people were injured and which has already claimed the lives of  about
       182 people;
  (2) further notes that 19 South Africans who were allegedly  in  Bali  at
       the time of  the  bomb  blast,  were  posted  as  missing  by  Monday
       afternoon;


  (3) condemns this cowardly, cold-blooded terror attack on innocent people
       in the strongest terms;


  (4) believes that  the  necessary  steps  will  be  taken  to  bring  the
       perpetrators to book, but also that the international community  will
       act in concert in the struggle to eradicate terrorism; and


  (5) expresses its sympathy and condolences to the relatives of those  who
       died in the blast.]

                 REMEDYING A NATIONWIDE STATE OF MORAL DECAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS:  Madam Speaker, I hereby move without notice:
  That the House regards the persistent scourge of child rape as  the  most
  hideous, brutal and despicable sign of a nation-wide state of moral decay
  that must be remedied through the participation of all South Africans  of
  goodwill, and therefore -


  (1)  urges  all  citizens,  churches,  grassroots  organisations,   civic
       organisations and other institutions of civil society to  join  hands
       in a campaign of solidarity and moral regeneration similar to the one
       which brought together all South Africans of goodwill in the struggle
       against apartheid; and


  (2) appeals to the leaders of all  democratic  parties,  irrespective  of
       political divisions, to join forces and become visible  in  promoting
       this struggle, highlighting their shared commitment rather than their
       differences.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, on  24  June  this  year,  this
National Assembly adopted the report of the task group on the  sexual  abuse
of children. That report highlighted the dimensions, extent and features  of
the hideous phenomenon of child rape and abuse, and it proposed, in fact,  a
very comprehensive course of action for the Government to follow.

The report of the task group outlined  details  of  responsibility  of  each
relevant line function and created the parameters for Government's  response
to this scourge. The report also dwelt upon the investigation of the  causes
of  child  rape   and   identified   its   connection   with   poverty   and
underdevelopment. The publication of that report was the  point  of  arrival
of a long process of growing awareness and  mobilisation  within  Government
and the various building blocks of our society.

As a consequence of the implementation of  that  report,  there  is  now  an
almost   horizontal   function   which   cuts   across   the   line-function
responsibilities of  many  of  our  departments.  Moreover,  many  political
parties have developed their own programmes to protect our children  and  to
mobilise important institutions  of  civil  society  such  as  churches  and
community organisations in a comprehensive effort to eradicate this curse.

However, child rape has not stopped. A few weeks ago, press reports  shocked
the country and a new wave of moral indignation swept our communities as  we
were confronted with the graphic picture of a  six-year-old  girl  with  her
intestines hanging out of her vagina after she had been  brutally  raped.  I
am a man who has seen many horrors and more brutality than most. I bear  the
weight of the horrors that I have witnessed  through  decades  of  atrocious
conflicts which have tainted our country's soil with  blood.  Yet,  I  could
not but  be  moved  to  tears  and  seized  with  unparalleled  horror  when
confronted with such blind and inane brutality. The  whole  of  our  country
had a similar reaction.

It is important that this National Assembly again expresses  its  horror  at
the phenomenon of child rape and abuse because we cannot  accept  that  this
may ever become a feature of a society which may ever become used  to  them.
I think that even if we need to hold debates of this nature  over  and  over
again, we shall relinquish no opportunity to express our horror  and  voice,
in this House, how our people on the ground feel about it.

However, on this occasion it becomes clear that we  must  go  beyond  ritual
condemnations, no matter how strongly and  sincerely  we  feel  about  them.
From this House, we need to mobilise the  logistical,  moral  and  spiritual
forces necessary to redress  this  phenomenon  and  eradicate  it  from  our
society. Condemnation and remedial action must go hand in  hand.  We  should
not risk a new tragedy of the type which took  place  when  our  communities
were seized with the brutality unleashed by the internecine  conflict  among
our people in the 80s and 90s which cost so  many  lives.  We  now  have  an
entire generation of our people who grew up in many communities  and  became
used to  brutality,  violence  and  savage  practices  of  torture  such  as
necklacing, for instance. For them, that brutality became part of  the  only
reality they knew and set the basis of what was acceptable.

From this venue, we must send a clear and loud message that child  rape  and
abuse are not acceptable in any way, shape or form and that even though  the
media may report several  instances  of  such  hideous  occurrences,  by  no
stretch of the imagination should any one of us grow to  believe  that  they
are part and parcel of the life we live or as a fact of life.

The findings of the report of the task team  indicate  that  the  causes  of
this hideous phenomenon run  deep  and  include  conditions  of  social  and
economic underdevelopment, and breakdown in the social and  moral  fibre  of
our communities. For this reason remedial  action  cannot  come  exclusively
from  what  Government  can  do,  but  must  become  an  effort  which  runs
horizontally throughout all the building blocks of  our  society,  including
churches, workplaces, community organisations and families.

Child rape and abuse are the hideous  tip  of  a  much  larger  iceberg.  We
cannot deal  with  this  tip  unless  we  have  the  courage,  strength  and
determination to expose the whole of the  iceberg  and  deal  with  it  with
single-minded resolve. We need to change long-entrenched attitudes and  move
our people away from brutality and forward into a new moral matrix which  is
capable of holding together our communities as we struggle  to  uplift  them
from a social and economic viewpoint.

We  must  change  mind-sets   and   attitudes   as   we   promote   physical
infrastructure and economic development. If the latter does  not  come  fast
enough, we must not hold back on developing  the  former.  It  may  be  that
moral upliftment and spiritual renewal must come  first.  The  base  of  the
iceberg of every child rape and abuse lies in the ocean of  poverty,  abject
social  economic  conditions,  underdevelopment,   human   degradation   and
ignorance for lack of education, knowledge and exposure.

Below its floating line, this iceberg consists  of  a  deep-seated  lack  of
respect for women and children mixed with despair. As a Government, we  have
entered into a number of international conventions which protect  women  and
children, and we have adopted extensive legislation to  that  end.  However,
unless we change individual,  collective  and  community  attitudes  towards
women and children, the successful  implementation  of  these  international
and domestic provisions of law  will  remain  elusive.  We  need  to  change
attitudes in communities, workplaces and families, and with  the  assistance
of all building blocks of society, promote respect for women and children.

We need a national  campaign  which  will  promote  mental  health,  greater
individual respect and greater awareness of the  facts  of  human  sexuality
and dignity. All civilisations have marked  their  path  of  individual  and
collective growth through awareness of and respect  for  the  importance  of
life and dignity of a single individual, so that no one should be  perceived
and treated as a lesser being than anyone else.
We must look at all the  components  of  the  large  submerged  iceberg  and
acknowledge that amongst the causes of human degradation, which we  are  not
sufficiently addressing, is the abuse  of  substances  -  not  only  illegal
substances, but also alcohol. I offer my apologies to the consumers of  this
respectable drug. We need  to  promote  programmes  to  teach  physical  and
mental health to our people and the importance of proper nutrition  as  part
of one's own basic dignity.

We must  also  begin  to  promote  a  nationwide  campaign  to  address  the
degrading effects of alcoholism on our people, which is  one  of  the  great
plagues of our nation, and thus far we have chosen not to pay it  sufficient
attention. We must also fight in  all  ways  possible  the  spread  of  this
idiotic myth that raping a virgin may in  any  way  assist  in  coping  with
HIV/Aids or even cure it. For this reason, we need  to  treat  this  problem
with the collective approach which  I  can  only  liken  to  the  one  which
brought us together when we fought against apartheid.

Our country has a beautiful history of people  coming  together  across  the
then existing social, economic and cultural divides to join  hands  together
to bring about the change from apartheid to democracy. Rich and poor,  black
and white, worked together to build the new democratic country. It  is  very
painful to me that I now do not see the same spirit of goodwill  in  action.
It is painful for me to see that many segments of  our  society  which  have
the  capacity  to  bring  about  a  positive  difference  instead   insulate
themselves  from  the  hideous  phenomena  of  social,  economic  and  human
degradation such as child  rape  and  abuse  merely  because  they  are  not
affected by them.

We need to recreate the awareness  that  we  are  a  united  and  continuous
society and that whatever happens in it must and will affect all of  us.  We
need to bring about the spirit of a revolution of goodwill in which  we  all
become responsible for making that difference. For that reason, I hope  that
through the debate today we can, in fact, highlight  our  shared  commitment
to a revolution of goodwill, set aside political  divisions  and  show  that
we, as South Africans, are equally committed to  bringing  about  a  society
which no longer suffers from the  types  of  human  degradation  and  social
abjection which have produced child rape and abuse. [Applause.]

Mr S L DITHEBE: Madam Speaker, hon members, Nelson Mandela and Graca  Machel
warned us, and I quote:


  We cannot waste our precious children, not another one, not another  day.
  It is long past the time for us to act on their behalf.

It is for this reason that I  believe  that  the  rape  of  a  child  is  so
horrific that it cannot but  leave  each  one  of  us  outraged  and  deeply
saddened. It would take us much longer  than  the  time  allocated  to  this
debate to read the list of names of children who over  the  last  year  have
survived sexual violence. This list is growing as we speak. There is no  one
among us who does not agree that we have to view 20 000  reported  cases  of
sexual violence against children in our country as a crisis. But  I  do  not
think that the dramatisation  of  these  crimes  should  make  us  grasp  at
dramatic but unsustainable responses or solutions.

I believe that we must reflect soberly on two core questions with regard  to
child rape. The first is: How do we care for and  respond  to  survivors  of
child rape? The second and, I believe, the more difficult question  is:  How
do we stop these brutal rapes?

When the parliamentary task group on the sexual  abuse  of  children  tabled
its report in this House on June 12, we believed that  we  were  taking  the
first steps towards coming to grips with this horror.  The  report  contains
some very  important  recommendations,  which  I  believe  should  form  the
background against which we debate today.

We must now proceed  with  the  tabling  of  comprehensive  legislation  for
children. The legislation must lay the basis on which all  our  efforts  for
the protection of children and the realisation of children's rights must  be
focused. The legislative mechanisms must reflect our  understanding  of  the
distinct nature of child sexual abuse, while at the  same  time  recognising
that children's needs are multidimensional, and that addressing their  needs
requires a multidisciplinary and integrated approach.

If we do not have a common national understanding  of  child  rape  and  its
impact on the life of the child, and we  therefore  do  not  have  a  common
understanding of how to respond to the child's needs, the legislation  might
not offer the protection it should.  I  believe  that  our  legislation  for
children must be underpinned by a national protocol  on  child  abuse.  This
protocol  must  contain  very  clear  guidelines  about  what   parents   or
caregivers can and should do as soon as they discover that a child has  been
raped. Such a protocol must be available at the level  of  every  community,
every public library, every  school,  every  primary  health  clinic,  every
church, and every community-based organisation.

In addition, I believe that we should make  resources  available  to  ensure
that the protocol is translated in each of the 11  official  languages,  and
that it is workshopped, understood and accepted in  communities  across  the
country. Our people must know whether to  report  to  the  police  or  to  a
social worker, should a social  worker  be  available,  or  to  a  community
health worker. They should also know what to  expect  from  this  person  to
whom they have reported the rape.

The protocol must of course also address those steps that must  be  followed
by personnel in those protective and support services with which  the  raped
child comes into contact. It must say clearly  to  the  police  official  or
social worker to whom the abuse is reported, how to  care  for  and  support
the child. It must say clearly what the responsibilities  of  the  different
role-players in the protective network should be.

I would like to congratulate the hon the Minister of Social  Development  on
the steps he has already taken to  get  such  a  protocol  off  the  ground.
However, it cannot be the responsibility of this department alone.  It  must
be the product of real collaboration and shared responsibility  between  the
Departments of Safety and Security, Justice, Health, and Education,  and  it
must reflect input from broader society. I therefore want to call  on  civil
society organisations to act on this call to participate in the  development
of the protocol, and to monitor its implementation vigilantly.

But  if  we  develop  a  protocol  that  speaks  about  particular   support
structures for child survivors of rape, and  for  their  families,  we  must
also make a  concerted  effort  to  ensure  that  those  support  structures
function effectively and  efficiently.  We  have  to  address  the  lack  of
resources in  the  child  protection  units.  We  have  to  understand  that
personnel in these units work under tremendous strain, and  that  they  need
constant  debriefing  and  counselling  support.  We  must   recognise   the
dedication of these police officers, and acknowledge the severe trauma  they
are faced with every  day.  I  would  therefore  like  to  congratulate  the
extraordinary  efforts  of  the  officers  from  the  Durban   North   Child
Protection Unit, who arrested 21  persons  in  connection  with  child  rape
charges at the end of August.

In addition, we must make sure that those social workers,  police  officers,
health practitioners and justice officials designated to working with  child
survivors of sexual violence are appropriately trained, and that  they  have
a shared responsibility for the best  interests  of  the  child  under  such
circumstances. We must make  sure  that  the  child  who  has  already  been
severely traumatised by the sexual violence, is  not  exposed  to  secondary
abuse at the hands of ill-trained, ill-equipped or overworked officials.

Again I would like to commend the work that has already  begun  in  relation
to the justice system, where training initiatives have  been  launched  with
the support of the department. Perhaps we need to go further  and  challenge
this department, as well as the Department  of  Health,  to  set  particular
targets for the training of personnel as designated and specialised to  deal
with and provide services and support to rape survivors. We have to make  an
end to the impression people have that the  child  protection  services  are
failing our children, and so courts across the country have to  be  seen  to
be making headway with the backlog in cases.

Backlogs often cause a family whose child  has  been  raped  to  go  through
repeated postponements of up  to  a  year  before  the  case  is  concluded,
forcing them every time to relive the horror of what  has  happened  to  the
child. At the same time we must restore the trust people have in  our  court
system by ensuring that sentences handed down  to  convicted  sex  offenders
are consistent, and that sentences reflect the  seriousness  with  which  we
view the crime of child rape. It was right and just  that  the  man  who  so
brutally raped baby Tshepang in October last year received a life sentence.

I believe that by taking some of these smaller steps, and making  sure  that
our resources are appropriately prioritised, we can make a  real  difference
in the lives of child rape survivors. But we must caution  against  once-off
programmes that are not sustainable. If we are saying that  child  rape  has
been with us for a long time, then we must realise that quick-fix  solutions
will not take us anywhere.

We must  therefore  perhaps  consider  calling  together  a  task  team,  at
departmental level, of  representatives  of  all  the  different  Government
departments that  have  responsibilities  towards  children,  to  act  as  a
consultative and co-ordinating structure.

Social services in South Africa are often said to be seriously  underfunded.
Perhaps this is because we have not managed to  separate  the  functions  of
social security administration from  those  of  a  more  substantial  social
development programme. In fact, in many functioning democracies there  is  a
clear distinction between the two areas, which allows  for  social  services
and development work each to be viewed in its own right.  I  would  like  to
propose today that we table this matter for serious debate.

Furthermore, for our efforts  to  be  sustainable,  we  must  support  those
organisations that provide essential  services  to  survivors  of  rape  and
their families. Civil society organisations must be an integral part of  the
provision  of  social  development  services,  yet   the   limited   funding
Government makes available to them suggests to  many  of  the  professionals
working in the field that we are not serious about partnering with them.

Finally, we as members of the Parliament must take  up  the  challenge  with
different Government departments. The  parliamentary  committees  that  were
part of the task group have committed themselves to reporting back  to  this
House before the end of June 2003  on  progress  made  with  regard  to  the
recommendations in the task group's report. Let us honour that commitment.

That brings me to what I earlier called the more difficult question: How  do
we stop this scourge? Again, I believe that it  is  only  through  sustained
and co-ordinated efforts that we can overcome this crisis.

I therefore want to plead with the Office of the Presidency to  lead  public
campaigns  and  awareness  programmes  aimed  at  changing  the  culture  of
violence that we are experiencing, and aimed at challenging the gender  bias
of a significant proportion of that violence. To this end,  we  welcome  the
coming launch  of  the  Volunteer  Child  Network,  a  web  access  database
developed by the CSIR  Crime  Prevention  Centre  in  partnership  with  the
President's Office for the Rights of the Child,  the  Department  of  Social
Development, the SAPS and other organisations, to facilitate  assessment  of
skills for volunteers in  the  prevention  of  child  abuse  and  access  to
organisations which recruit, train or manage such volunteers.

We must speak to our men and our boys; we must do it in the schools, at  bus
stands,  on  trains,  in  the  churches,  mosques  and   temples,   in   our
constituencies and in each and every public space. We  must  recognise  that
we will have to keep on speaking for as long as it takes. We have been  able
to mobilise our people towards a peaceful,  democratic  transition.  We  now
need to mobilise our people towards an end to child rape.

The protection that the UN Charter on the Rights of the  Child  affords  our
children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, in terms  of  article
34, must not become a mere dream,  but  an  everyday  experience  for  them.
[Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker, sexual abuse of children in South Africa  has
increased at a horrifying rate in recent months. While sexual abuse  is  not
a new phenomenon, recent trends in the violent nature of the  crimes  are  a
serious cause for concern.

South Africa has unfortunately acquired the label of being the rape  capital
of the world, with  one  child  being  raped  every  24  minutes.  Only  the
horrific cases make it to the press, but there are many more  that  do  not,
because child abuse is an under-reported crime.

From January to September 2001, of the reported 15 500 rapes 6 000  were  on
children between the ages of nought and 11 years, and  the  conviction  rate
was a mere 8%. While we can  all  bicker  about  the  statistics  and  score
political points, the reality is that every rape is one rape too many.

HON MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

Mrs S V KALYAN: A possible reason for, or the  cause  of,  the  increase  in
sexual  assault  on  children  may  be  the  breakdown  or  decline  of  the
traditional extended family system.

South Africa subscribes to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child  and
the South African Constitution also provides  special  protections  for  the
child. It provides for children to be protected from maltreatment,  neglect,
abuse and degradation. Yet, there is still no national strategy in place  to
combat and prevent child sexual abuse, and the  present  response  is  quite
fragmented.

The task team on child abuse found, during  its  deliberations,  that  there
are serious challenges in the way  that  Government  supports  services  and
programmes aimed at preventing sexual abuse of children.

But while we wait for Government to  get  its  act  together,  let  us  also
acknowledge that translating  the  Constitution  into  reality  is  not  the
responsibility of Government alone. It  is  a  collective  responsibility  -
that of every member, and that of every man, woman and child out there.

There are many challenges facing us as a nation to  curb  child  rape.  Most
often abuse is perpetrated by family members  and  someone  whom  the  child
trusts. There is  overwhelming  denial  to  face  the  perpetrators  because
usually the family is financially dependent on the perpetrator.

Victims of sexual assault are at a much higher risk of being  infected  with
HIV through  assault.  So,  yet  another  challenge  is  the  reluctance  of
families  to  test  the  child  for  HIV.  Furthermore,  we  have  to  lobby
collectively for post-exposure prophylaxis for  rape  victims,  and  destroy
the myth that having sex with a virgin girl child will cure HIV/Aids.

Now while there is no magic  formula,  by  thinking,  planning  and  working
together, we can achieve the collective goal  of  eradicating  child  abuse.
Each community should work together to start  up  a  community  watch.  This
watch can identify the strengths and resources in  the  community,  and  the
wisdom of the elders and mobilise them to protect  children,  in  particular
to protect the girl child.

Every MP here has a constituency office. In view  of  the  fact  that  child
protection units are few and constrained by a lack  of  manpower  and  other
resources, I ask every MP to make their  offices  available  as  a  starting
point  to  seek  the  support  and  involvement  of  all  partners  in  this
prevention strategy. The DA calls on civil  society  organisations  such  as
Rotary to support these initiatives, and it is my belief that efforts  aimed
at  preventing  child  abuse  and  neglect  should  incorporate  the  axiom,
``injobo enhle ithunelwa ebandla.'' [Two heads are better than one.]

The scars of an abused child will never go away. The harm is  both  physical
and psychological and it has a serious impact on  the  moral  fibre  of  our
society. Let us work collectively as a nation to  eradicate  this  evil  and
senseless phenomenon  and  regain  our  morals  as  a  society  that  cares.
[Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Speaker, this must be one of the  saddest  debates  I
have participated in during my 15 years in Parliament. It is  good  that  we
do so, but the fact that we as parliamentarians felt it necessary to  debate
this shocking, sickening topic is in itself a black mark  against  our  name
as a nation.

The horrific facts giving rise to this debate should make each one of us  in
this Chamber feel shame that any  South  African  could  perpetrate  such  a
barbaric act, let alone in such numbers. The men  who  commit  these  crimes
are animals, beasts, and no condemnation is enough. That having  been  said,
I hope sincerely that some good will come out of this debate. On  the  legal
side there should be more severe punishment for the  perpetrators.  The  New
NP advocates the death penalty  for  this  crime  as  a  sentencing  option.
[Interjection.] Also, more  resources  should  be  allocated  to  the  child
protection units of the SAPS which do  a  magnificent  job  under  difficult
circumstances.

The parliamentary task group on the sexual abuse of children,  whose  report
was tabled earlier this year, has established that these units are  severely
under-resourced. We also need more resources for  the  desk  of  the  Deputy
Director of Public Prosecutions  in  charge  of  crimes  against  women  and
children,  in  order  to  ensure  effective  prosecution  of  these   sexual
offences. We need more specialist sexual offences  courts.  They  achieve  a
much better rate of conviction, and more speedily.

At present these exist at only 10 centres, whereas 20 were promised  by  the
Minister for Justice and Constitutional  Development  by  the  end  of  this
year. We fear that the Department of Justice is  falling  behind  with  this
programme and the New NP urges the Minister and  the  Government  to  ensure
that it is kept on track.

Likewise, legislation that could have an  impact  on  the  judicial  process
around these appalling crimes has been  delayed.  These  Bills  include  the
Child Justice Bill, the new Sexual Offences Bill and the  Bill  relating  to
compulsory HIV testing for sexual offenders. All these Bills  appear  to  be
delayed until next year while the country cries out for them to  be  speeded
up. The New  NP  calls  on  the  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development to act accordingly.

Legal process addresses the symptoms, the results of  these  terrible  acts;
but we need to address  the  causes  and  to  take  preventive  action.  The
resolution of  the  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  calls  for  a  campaign  of
solidarity and moral regeneration,  and  the  New  NP  supports  that  whole
heartedly. However, to be successful we must also analyse the  situation  on
the ground in order to ensure that the steps we take are successful.

South Africa is one of the most violent countries in  the  world,  as  other
speakers have said. The American Human Rights Watch said  in  1995  that  it
was clear that South African women were living in one of  the  most  violent
countries in the world. And on a daily basis South African  girls  of  every
race and every economic  class  encounter  sexual  violence  and  harassment
which impedes their right to education.

According to the statistical picture, women and children bear the  brunt  of
the violence in our country.  In  the  first  place  we  have  the  shameful
distinction of having the highest number of rapes per capita in  the  world.
Last year 37 000 women laid charges of rape with the SAPS, and as  we  know,
that is the tip of the iceberg.

The South African Human Rights Commission estimates that  almost  one  third
of South Africa's children has been subjected to  sexual  abuse  before  the
age of 18. The Child Protection Unit deals with 20  to  30  cases  of  child
rape a week.

The media reported recently that 5 000 newborn babies were  discarded  every
year. What sort of society are we? In the first place, we are a  society  in
which, despite  what  our  Constitution  says,  women  are  very  often  not
regarded as fully equal with men. Women's status is generally low. This  was
given as the main reason for the high incidence of  violence  against  women
in this country in a 1998 United Nations research paper.

In sum, it is axiomatic and an accepted  standard  internationally  that  in
societies where the dignity of women is  respected  and  women's  status  is
high, children are safer from abuse. The fate of children often follows  the
fate of their mothers and grandmothers. It is undeniable  that  the  two  go
hand in hand. Decreasing violence against women and enhancing  their  status
would  pay  handsome  dividends  and  this  should  be  the  focus  of   any
regeneration campaign.

A programme of moral regeneration is an excellent  starting  point,  but  we
need the full backing of Government resources, in terms of the  Government's
commitment under the Constitution, to promote rights of  equality  in  order
to eliminate this scourge of child abuse.

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  the
horror and disgrace of child rape in this country  cannot  be  described  in
language. We received oral submissions from children who  were  the  victims
of this despicable crime. What they  told  us  was  so  horrifying  and  the
courage they displayed in dealing with their  ordeal  was  so  extraordinary
that all of us were left speechless, and many of us in tears.

How many of these young victims are still  out  there,  unknown  to  us  and
without any support structure? We simply do not  know.  The  nature  of  the
crime means  that  most  victims  suffer  in  silence.  Often,  because  the
perpetrators tend to be family members or friends, it is  a  crime  that  is
committed repeatedly, over a long period of time.
We cannot ever say that it is not within our power to eradicate this  crime,
because that would be tantamount to condemning thousands of children to  the
most degrading, inhuman suffering imaginable.

So, what can we do? I would like to make three proposals, although there  is
certainly much more that can be done. The UDM believes that  by  immediately
implementing the following three proposals, we will be able to see real  and
sustainable improvements.

Firstly, education and awareness around this issue must be  intensified.  It
is fine and well for this House  to  discuss  this  matter  and  lament  the
incidence of child rape, but ultimately, it must be something that each  and
every South African is aware of. Child rape must  simply  cease  to  be  the
silent and unspoken evil that walks  blatantly  in  our  neighbourhoods  and
communities.

Education must be targeted. Our children, boys and  girls,  must  be  taught
that they have  the  right  to  speak  out.  What  is  more,  they  must  be
encouraged to speak out. We must teach them  that  their  bodies  belong  to
them and them alone. We must  teach  them  that  the  insipid  arguments  of
sexual molesters that their behaviour is a show of affection or love,  is  a
lie.

We must educate them in a fashion that reaffirms their dignity and does  not
leave them with the thought that, somehow, they are guilty or that they  are
dirty. Too often, this still happens when rape survivors do speak out.

Education and awareness campaigns must also target boys and  men,  to  teach
them what their restrictions are in terms of sexual behaviour. We  must  say
this over and over: Nobody is entitled to sex. One cannot,  no  matter  what
one's position in a family or community, demand sex.

Secondly, the relationship between  the  criminal  justice  system  and  the
community must be improved. This means that South  Africans  must  learn  to
stop turning a blind eye to danger signals that they see in their own  homes
and those of their neighbours.
Similarly, we need a police force that refuses to bend its knee before  this
problem  because  it  appears  overwhelming.  We  need  a  national   Police
Commissioner that does not  blithely  say  that  certain  crimes  cannot  be
policed. Nonsense! We must not give a quarter before this challenge.  It  is
up to communities and the police,  in  co-operation,  to  prove  that  these
crimes will not be tolerated. Failure to do so will turn us  into  a  nation
of perpetrators and victims. We cannot countenance this.  As  a  nation,  we
are greater than this. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, on behalf of all law-abiding  citizens,  I
apologise to all the abused and raped children in our country.

Rape is a violent crime against any  individual  in  society  and  therefore
just punishment must be meted out. All the talkshops, public  participation,
legislation and the Constitution have not  ensured  a  safe  environment  to
protect our children.

This large institution is a paper tiger. It is toothless  and  the  criminal
is very aware of this. Every law-abiding  citizen,  from  our  aged  to  our
children, has become an open  target  for  criminals  to  do  with  as  they
please.

The time has come for the war against our  children  to  be  fought  in  the
open. Legislative preparedness is not enough and we  cannot  argue  lack  of
resources. What we lack is the political will to tackle the issues. The  war
against our children is a national crisis  with  dire  consequences,  simply
because there is a huge  surge  in  the  number  of  rapes,  while  criminal
convictions and appropriate sentences are just too low. The  ultimate  price
that  a  rapist  must  pay  is  the  wrath   of   Government   through   the
implementation of the death penalty. This is the only  form  of  retribution
and deterrent for this crime.

The ACDP recommends the immediate reinstatement  of  the  death  penalty,  a
more effective and efficient criminal justice  system  for  speedily  meting
out sentences, appropriate and  harsh  sentencing  for  various  degrees  of
crimes  against  our  children,  no  bail  for  repeat  offenders,  stricter
regulations for parole and not allowing amnesty for all and sundry.

There is the danger that if Government is not going to fulfil its  God-given
role to protect its citizens, by wielding the sword of justice against  rape
perpetrators, then it clearly leaves the communities to take  the  law  into
their own hands. This would take  South  Africa  on  a  downward  spiral  of
anarchy, and it would be very difficult to bring the rule of law  back  into
our society.

Sikhuluma nje kumanje kunenkolelo yokuthi ukunukubezwa kwabantwana  kubangwa
ukuthi abantu bayahlupheka futhi balambile. Yehheni, webantu! Insumansumane-
ke le. Silapha nje kule  Ndlu  namhlanje  iningi  lethu  sikhule  sihlupheka
ngendlela emangalisayo, sidla  izinkobe,  sihlala  emabhokisini  kamentshisi
ezindlu, siminyene  futhi  silala  ndawonye.  Ukuhlupheka  akuzange  kusenze
izilwane. [Ihlombe.]

Silapha namhlanje kule Ndlu ehloniphekile  ngoba  sasihlupheka.  Ukuhlupheka
nendlala  akukaze  nje  kwehlele  esinyeni.  Ngizoxolisa  bakwethu,   ngenxa
yokuthi lolu daba luvusa izinseka ngizohluba udlubu ekhasini.

Ngithi  kuNgqongqoshe  uMaduna  `awube  khona  umthetho  othi   bonke   laba
abadlwengula  abantwana  izithombe  zabo   nemininingwane   yabo   makulenge
ezigxotsheni nasezikhungweni zomphakathi, babonwe yizwe lonke'. [Ihlombe.]

KuNgqongqoshe wezikadalawane ngithi, `malube khona uphiko emnyangweni  wakhe
oluzobhekana ngqo  nokuqedwa  nya  kwezithombe  ezibonisa  izingane  zigilwa
imikhuba  futhi  lubhekane  nokudayiswa  kwabantwana  bedayiselwa  ezocansi.
Nakho belu ukuqwayiza  kwabantwana  kufanele  kuqedwe  nya.  Kufanele  iqale
ukusebenza eThekwini  nakithi  le  ePhoyinti,  eNtshonankoloni  naseGoli  le
mithetho. Masibonge  kuMafahleni,  impela  uyawuhola  umkhankaso  kaHulumeni
wokwakhiwa kabusha kwezimilo.

Kodwa  nansi  inkinga  esibhekene  nayo  la  eMzansi,   okuningi   esikubona
kumabonakude  wethu  imihla   namalanga   isinene,   udlame   nokudlwengula.
Umabonakude wethu awusakhe lesi sizwe,  awungasikhubazi.  Likhona  idlanzana
losonhlalakahle eliseyinkinga bakwethu.  Uma  kufika  umntwana  odlwenguliwe
kubo, kujike kube yiwona  aba  nezinkulumo  ezihlukumeza  le  ngane,  igcine
ingasafuni ukuqhubeka necala isisaba lo  muntu  okufanele  ngabe  uyayisiza.
Mabaphume baphele kulo mnyango. Kungcono beyosebenza emakhishini  ngoba  uma
bebulale isitsha umuntu uyakwazi ukusithenga esinye, ingane ayithengwa.

Kule Ndlu  miningi  imithetho  eshayiwe  mayelana  nokuvikelwa  kwabantwana.
UKhongolose  uyakholelwa  kakhulu  kumalungelo  abantwana.  Nakuba   kunjalo
kusekhona ukucekelwa phansi kwekusasa lezingane  zethu.  Kuyasika  bakwethu.
Izingane zimsulwa, azinacala  futhi  azinawo  namandla  okuzilwela.  Ngalezi
zizathu njengeNdlu ehlonipheke  kangaka  kufuneka  siphumele  eshashalazini.
Kufanele sime manje ukukhuluma, senze. Make kuphume thina la sonke  siyohola
umphakathi wonkana kukhukhulela ngoqo womkhankaso  wokuqeda  nya  lo  mhlola

Ngonyaka ka-1994 ngesikhathi kuthatha uHulumeni oholwa nguKhongolose  kuleli

[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Ms P  N  MNANDI:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Ministers,  Deputy  Ministers,  hon
members, comrades, relatives, pupils and teachers that  are  amongst  us,  I
would like to open my speech by reminding this House that  this  disgraceful
deed, which is being done by these dogs who abuse  our  children,  has  been
seriously discussed in this House this year.

There is a belief that child abuse is as a result  of  hunger  and  poverty.
Hey, this  is  absurd!  Most  of  us  in  this  House  grew  up  in  poverty
situations, eating boiled maize, living in  matchbox  houses,  crammed  into
and sleeping in one  room.  Nonetheless,  poverty  never  made  us  animals.
[Applause.]

We are here in this House today  because  we  were  suffering.  Poverty  and
hunger have nothing to do with sexuality. I would like to apologise  for  my
use of language. Due to the fact  that  this  topic  arouses  afterpains,  I
would like to get into details.

To the Minister for Social Justice and Constitutional Development,  Mr  P  M
Maduna, I am saying this: ``Let there be a law which  says  that  all  those
people who rape children should have their photographs in public  places  so
that the whole world sees them.'' [Applause.]
To the Minister of Correctional Services, I am saying this: ``Let  there  be
a section in his department that will specifically look into  the  abolition
of child pornography and the trading of children for  prostitution.''  Child
prostitution should  also  be  stopped  completely.  These  laws  should  be
implemented in Durban, the Western Cape and Johannesburg. Let us  thank  the
Deputy President, Mafahleni, for  leading  Government's  moral  regeneration
programme.

In South Africa we are faced with the problem that most  of  the  programmes
that we see on  TV  on  a  daily  basis  include  sex,  violence  and  rape.
Television should build this nation, and it should  not  destroy  it.  There
are still a  few  problematic  social  workers,  who  in  turn  use  abusive
language when a raped child is brought to them for assistance. Children  end
up refusing to continue with the trial because they are now afraid  of  this
person who is supposed to be helping. These types of social  workers  should
leave this department and look for jobs as domestic  workers  because  there
when a person breaks a plate, it could be replaced, but a  child  cannot  be
bought.

There have been many laws enacted in this House. The  ANC  believes  in  the
rights of children. Even though the ANC believes in these rights, there  are
still those who want  to  destroy  the  future  of  our  children.  This  is
distressing. Children are  innocent,  and  they  cannot  defend  themselves.
Therefore, as this House, we need to act and stop talking. Let us  all  from
this House lead a march, for the whole nation, against child abuse.

When the ANC took over, this Parliament became a parliament for the  people.
The Deputy Speaker always says that Parliament should go to the people.  For
the sake of our children,  let  us  go  to  the  people  in  unity,  not  as
different political parties. Let us work together. Stand up and  fight!  All
these abusers will rue the day that they were born. [Applause.]]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker,  on  my  way  to  this  debate  I  passed  a
beautiful two-year-old girl, who does not know me, but innocently smiled  at
me and greeted me. I asked myself: How could anyone in his right  mind  rape
a child?

As 'n mens een so 'n geval in 'n samelewing  het,  kan  'n  mens  dit  seker
probeer regverdig deur te sê dat daar in elke samelewing wel mal  mense  is.
As  daar  egter  verskillende  gevalle  is,  soos  in  Suid-Afrika,  en  dit
deurlopend voorkom, is dit 'n baie ernstige  situasie.  As  die  verkragting
van kinders en babas voortgaan, ongeag  byvoorbeeld  die  lewenslange  straf
wat die verkragter van Baba Tsepang gekry het, dan is ek geskok oor  hierdie
samelewing waarin ons leef.

'n Amerikaanse politikus het onlangs die Amerikaanse samelewing  gekritiseer
en het die volgende gesê: ``Dit is onmoontlik om die beskawing  te  handhaaf
met twaalfjariges wat kinders kry; met vyftienjariges wat  mekaar  doodmaak;
met sestienjariges wat weens Vigs sterf en met  agtienjariges  wat  diplomas
verwerf wat hulle nie eens kan lees nie''. Dit is verdoemende getuienis  oor
die Amerikaanse samelewing, maar ons is nie beter af  met  kinderverkragting
soos dit tans aangaan nie. Is daar oplossings? Ja, daar  is  en  my  tyd  is
ongelukkig beperk. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[If one has one such case in a  society,  one  can  perhaps  justify  it  by
saying that every society has mad people. If,  however,  there  are  various
cases such as in South Africa, and it happens  continually,  it  is  a  very
serious situation. If the rape of children  and  babies  continues,  despite
for the example the lifelong sentence the rapist of Baby  Tsepang  received,
then I am shocked by this society we are living in. An  American  politician
recently criticised the American society and said  the  following:  ``It  is
impossible to preserve civilisation with  twelve-year-olds  who  are  having
children; with fifteen-year-olds who are killing one another; with  sixteen-
year-olds who are dying as a result of Aids and with eighteen-year-olds  who
are obtaining diplomas which they cannot read.'' This  is  damning  evidence
about the American society, but we are no better off with child rape  as  is
presently the case. Are there solutions? Yes,  there  are  but  my  time  is
unfortunately limited.]

Will Durandt is quoted in The death of the West  as  follows,  and  I  would
like to read the quote:


  There is no significant example in history before our  time,  of  society
  successfully maintaining moral life without the aid of religion.

Godsdiens word tans in ons skole, ons media  en  in  gesprekke  afgemaak  as
outyds, as nie ``cool'' nie en nie deel van die sogenaamde Nuwe  Suid-Afrika
nie. Ek herhaal die aanhaling:


  There is no significant example in history before our  time,  of  society
  successfully maintaining moral life without the aid of religion.

Ek wil verwys  na  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  tydskrif  Huisgenoot/You,  wat  die
grootste sirkulasie in Suid-Afrika het. Die tydskrif het onlangs  'n  opname
gemaak wat bevind het dat 97% van sy lesers vra vir  die  herinstelling  van
die doodstraf vir motorkapers,  moordenaars  en  verkragters.  Die  Regering
durf nie huiwer om drasties op te tree  teen  hierdie  verskriklike  misdaad
teen kinders nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Currently in our schools, in our media and in  our  conversations  religion
is derided as being old-fashioned and not cool or part of the so-called  New
South Africa. I repeat the quote:


  There is no significant example in history before our  time,  of  society
  successfully maintaining moral life without the aid of religion.

I want to refer to the South African publication Huisgenoot/You,  which  has
the biggest circulation in South Africa. The magazine recently  conducted  a
survey which found that 97% of its readers asked for  the  reinstatement  of
the death penalty for hijackers, murderers and rapists. The Government  does
not dare hesitate in taking drastic steps  to  stop  these  terrible  crimes
against children.]

Mrs M A SEECO: Madam Speaker  and  hon  members,  everyone  has  a  duty  to
protect children from rape and sexual abuse. They need to  be  removed  from
the abuse situation. We need to go back to the basics.

Sir Seretse Kgama said a mouthful when he said, and I quote:


  A nation without a past is a lost nation, and a people without a past  is
  a people without a soul.

We must promote the notion of ``every child is my child''. Our children  are
angry at their powerlessness to prevent  sexual  abuse  and  the  fact  that
rapists are often not brought to justice. Children  have  the  right  to  be
protected from sexual violence and abuse. We as women must love them  enough
to gain their trust so that they can enjoy their childhood.

The UCDP commended the Minister of Social Development for  having  consented
to  the  establishment  of  social  assistance.  The  chronic  poverty   and
unemployment in the country  should  be  addressed  or  the  situation  will
continue. The wellbeing of children will not improve.

Ke rata go ikuela go bomme gore re eme ka dinao,  re  gopole  lebele  le  le
anyisitseng.  Ngwana  sejo  o  a  tlhakanelwa.  Marabe  o  jewa   ke   bana.
(Translation of Tswana paragraph follows.)

[I would like to appeal to the women to stand  up  and  remember  the  udder
that feeds. A child's upbringing is the responsibility of all adults.]

Article 16 of the OAU Charter on the  Rights  and  Welfare  of  the  African
Child, deals with the protection of children from all forms of torture,  and
inhumane or degrading  treatment.  Therefore,  people  have  to  learn  that
HIV/Aids cannot be cured by raping a  child.  Child  rape  and  abuse  is  a
crime. The cleansing myth needs to be openly challenged  by  public  figures
and the maximum sentence should be imposed on  anyone  who  rapes  a  child.
Rapists should rot in jail for ever.

Children need food in order to stay healthy. Therefore the Government  as  a
whole should provide  assistance  to  poor  families  and  should  implement
strategies to increase  employment  opportunities.  This  would  reduce  the
crisis of hunger and malnutrition  that  is  plaguing  children,  especially
those in  rural  areas.  The  nutritional  support  programmes  run  by  the
Departments of Social Development and Health, such  as  the  school  feeding
scheme, should continue and be improved upon. The UCDP supports the motion.

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, once again we have another  debate  on  child
rape. We must ask ourselves: What is the point of getting  outraged  without
supporting the rape survivors? We might be feeling good about  our  outrage,
but this is not helping the victims.

We tend to focus on arrest and conviction only. This is not enough. We  must
look at long-term support for the survivor and  the  family.  We  must  also
provide support for the communities to deal with this problem. We must  call
on communities to break the  silence  and  report  family  members  who  are
abusing and raping children. Let us not sacrifice our children for the  sake
of protecting the so-called family dignity  and  shame.  We  must  establish
special centres that  can  provide  counselling  and  antiretroviral  drugs.
Child rape survivors grow up to become parents, and without  counselling  to
rework the trauma they grow up to become abusive parents themselves.

In November 1999 the People Opposed to Women Abuse handed  over  a  petition
of  600  000  signatures,  calling  for  better  policing,  prosecution  and
antiretroviral drugs. This petition was  received  by  an  official  of  the
Department of Justice.

Gloria Legodi, the mother of the three-year-old  twins  who  were  sodomised
and raped by a 57 year-old family member, will be handing  over  a  petition
to the Government on 25 November  this  year.  It  would  be  good  if  this
petition could be received by President Mbeki himself  to  show  that  South
Africans care. When we refuse to take rape survivors  seriously,  we  become
complicit in perpetuating rape.

The PAC supports the draft resolution.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, Deputy  President  and  the  Ministers,  hon
members, so much to say in this important debate, so little time.

At just one hospital, 200 horrific cases of  child  rape  were  reported  in
2001, most commonly involving the age group between seven  and  nine  years.
This was reported at just one institution of the many in the country.  These
cases involved those who  dared  to  come  forward  to  expose  the  tragic,
barbaric incidents, while many more lie buried under the carpets  of  close-
knit communities.

The MF is shocked and disgusted to have learnt that in  recent  years  South
Africa has become one of the countries with the highest rates  of  rape  and
sexual assault in the world. What does this say about our social fabric?

Recently the false assumption that having sex with a virgin would  cure  one
of Aids has resulted in many more child rape incidents. This is  despicable.
The MF is however encouraged by certain  differences  in  society,  such  as
that the South African police,  unlike  under  the  previous  regime,  takes
sexual offences  even  in  black  areas  seriously.  This  certainly  builds
confidence within the community.

However, the downside is that only 7% of reported cases of rape resulted  in
conviction. This exhibits a  weak  judicial  system.  What  message  are  we
sending out? Are we not then causing  society  to  lose  confidence  in  our
system? Are we not saying to rapists: ``You know what, rape - you  will  get
away with it easily''.

This is not what we want. We want all our people to be  safe.  We  want  our
children to  be  safe.  We  want  criminals  to  know  the  seriousness  and
determination of the long arm of the law to eradicate crime.

The MF strongly supports the draft resolution on child rape. It is our  duty
as Government to protect our young ones and our people. Hon  members  should
remember the slogan: Your child is my child, my child is your child.

Ingane yami, yingane yakho.  Ingane  yakho,  yingane  yami.  [Ihlombe.]  [My
child is your child; your child is my child. [Applause.]]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mev die  Speaker,  kinderverkragting  illustreer  die  laagste
vorm van morele menslike bestaan denkbaar. Ons het nou lank genoeg  gepraat,
debatte gehou en planne aangeneem oor iets so afskuweliks. Dit  is  nou  tyd
vir doen. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, child  rape  illustrates  the  lowest  form  of
moral human existence imaginable. We  have  talked  for  long  enough,  held
enough debates and adopted enough plans regarding  something  so  atrocious.
It is now time for doing.]

South Africa has adopted one  plan  and  charter  after  another:  the  1990
Summit for  Children's  Goals  for  Survival,  Protection,  Development  and
Participation, the United Convention on the Rights of the Child,  the  First
Call for Children, a national plan of  action  for  children,  the  Bill  of
Rights in our Constitution, the African Charter on the  Rights  and  Welfare
of the Child and a report by a task group of this  House  on  24  June  this
year. However, children are still abused and raped in  South  Africa  at  an
alarming rate.

Die jaar 2000 se statistieke vir die  eerste  11  maande  toon  dat  14  225
kinders verkrag is, teenoor 7 500 in  1994.  'n  Tendens  wat  'n  mens  tot
kommer stem is dat slagoffers  van  seksuele  geweld  al  hoe  jonger  word.
Voorheen was babas die uitsondering; die afgelope twee jaar raak dit al  hoe
meer algemeen.

Die AEB wil net twee fokuspunte van hierdie debat belig, en  die  eerste  is
die taak van die kerk: (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Statistics for the first 11 months of  the  year  2000  show  that  14  225
children had been raped, in contrast with 7 500 in 1994. A trend that  gives
one cause for concern is that the victims of  sexual  violence  are  getting
younger and younger. Before babies were the exception; this has become  more
common in the past two years.

The AEB would like to highlight just two focal points in  this  debate,  and
the first is the responsibility of the church.]

The Church is the most important role-player in the upliftment of the  moral
fibre of a country. The church must never be seen as an opponent,  but  must
be seen as a vital companion in  the  mammoth  task  of  creating  a  better
country for all its children. It should not be an  institution  that  merely
preaches general human values, with no impact, but one that gives  direction
and security in the lives of its members.

Tweedens  wil  ek  'n  pleidooi  lewer   vir   die   verbetering   van   ons
strafregstelsel wat dringend aangepas moet word vir hierdie  soort  misdaad.
Volgens  syfers  van   2000   is   65   000   sake   by   die   polisie   se
kinderbeskermingseenheid aangemeld. Hiervan het 25 083 sake die hof  gehaal,
waarvan net 7 099 beskuldigdes gevonnis is. Weens die groot getal  sake  wag
kinders soms 'n jaar of twee jaar voordat hulle  getuig.  Die  tydperk  moet
verkort word, sodat die gebeure nog vars in die  slagoffers  se  geheues  is
wanneer hulle moet getuig.

Laastens, die doodstraf moet  ingestel  word  vir  kinderverkragters.  Hulle
moet permanent uit die samelewing verwyder  word.  Hierdie  twee  voorbeelde
illustreer hoe staat  en  gemeenskap  saam  hierdie  probleem  moet  aanpak.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Secondly, I would like to  make  an  appeal  for  the  improvement  of  our
criminal justice system which should be adjusted urgently for this  kind  of
crime. According to figures for 2000, 65 000  cases  were  reported  to  the
child protection unit of the police. Of these,  25  083  cases  made  it  to
court, of which only 7 099 of the  accused  were  sentenced.  Owing  to  the
large number of cases, children sometimes have to wait a year or two  before
they testify. This period has to be  reduced,  so  that  the  incidents  are
still fresh in the victims' memories when they have to testify.

Lastly, capital punishment must be introduced for child rapists.  They  must
be removed from society  permanently.  These  two  examples  illustrate  how
state and community should tackle this problem together.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, we  have  debated  this  matter  time  and
again, and today I want to give another perspective,  highlighting  what  we
believe might be the cause of the problem. One of the things  that  we  have
inherited from the past, is cultural  domination.  For  many  decades  black
people, in particular, were  subjected  to  cultural  oppression,  with  the
result that they were deprived of their  capacity  to  champion  values  and
norms consistent with the fundamental African principle of ubuntu.

It is generally acknowledged that  through  cultural  progress,  people  are
able to regulate their relationship  with  others,  young  and  old.  It  is
through the development of human values, based on  cultural  progress,  that
society creates normal forms of relationship that protect life.

When people are systematically placed in circumstances such as  the  migrant
labour system, forced to stay in houses where  there  is  no  privacy,  when
young children grow up in places of accommodation  where  at  a  tender  age
they watch their parents making love, then subcultures  are  developed  that
lead to moral disorientation. The phenomenon of child rape can in  some  way
be linked to moral and psychological disorientation.

Although many politicians and other influential people in South Africa  have
warned that we should not blame apartheid for  every  ill  in  our  society,
Azapo takes the view that the dehumanisation  that  was  part  of  both  the
colonial and apartheid systems, should not be overlooked.

When the 1994 elections were finalised,  and  the  new  society  started  to
emerge,  we  all  took  for  granted  that  every  dehumanised  soul   would
automatically fit in the new circumstances. [Time expired.]

Mr M WATERS: Chairperson, I would like all hon  members  of  this  House  to
think back to their last birthday and think about the  following  questions.
What colour underwear were you wearing? At what time and  in  what  sequence
did you receive your presents? Who gave you a kiss and who shook  your  hand
to wish you a happy birthday?

How many members can answer all three of these  questions  correctly?  I  do
not believe any of us can, but we expect children aged two, three  and  four
years to remember what colour underwear they were wearing on  the  day  they
were raped, we expect them to remember what time of day it was and  in  what
sequence the rape took place, that on a day that was not  a  happy  occasion
such as a birthday, but a day they wish to forget.

Now picture this: Imagine  a  small  child  trying  to  answer  those  three
questions some two years later in a courtroom, because that  is  the  length
of time it takes for the average child abuse case  to  reach  completion  in
our courts.

That is why the DA has  declared  a  state  of  emergency  on  child  abuse,
together with the highly respected organisation Women and Men against  Child
Abuse. When over 120 000 children were raped and abused over a period of  21
months to September last year and only 8% resulted in convictions, there  is
no way of describing the situation other than a state of emergency.

This declaration arises out of a fact-finding  mission  conducted  over  the
past few months by both the DA  and  Women  and  Men  against  Child  Abuse,
during which we visited  11  CPUs  or  child  protection  units  across  the
country.

Despite Government's statement that child abuse is a top priority crime,  we
discovered that CPUs are underfunded and that  they  are  ill  equipped  and
unable to combat the war being waged against our children.

All CPUs generally suffer the same deficiencies and shortcomings,  including
a debilitating lack of manpower, vehicles, communication  equipment,  child-
friendly facilities and accommodation. Most  units  are  operating  at  half
their optimal strength. These include Soweto,  Germiston,  Mitchells  Plain,
Durban South, Durban North, Johannesburg and Pretoria.

At the Benoni CPU the average case load per  investigating  officer  is  100
cases. They should be dealing with 25 cases per person. In addition  to  the
above, CPUs endure a multitude of  human  resource  problems,  such  as  low
salaries, inadequate debriefings, a  chronic  shortage  of  police  forensic
social workers, insultingly poor overtime remuneration, excessive delays  in
DNA reports, and a lack of training and trained officers.

A directive from the SAPS area office stipulates that the Durban  North  CPU
personnel may only claim a maximum of R2 537 per  member  per  annum  before
tax for overtime. This means that an inspector who works 76 hours extra  per
month only gets R2,78 per hour for  working  overtime.  That  is  below  the
minimum wage this Government has set.

CPUs say  that  they  are  treated  like  the  ``nappy  squad'',  while  the
Government says child abuse is  a  top  priority  crime.  Unfortunately  the
evidence on the ground proves the CPUs to be  right.  It  is  my  contention
that if the Government was serious about child abuse, as it  claims  to  be,
funding would immediately be released to CPUs and  other  organisations  who
put victims first. Having yet another child abuse debate in  this  House  is
pointless, unless it is matched with financial resources. [Applause.]

Mr M S BOOI: Chairperson, Deputy President, I do not agree  with  the  logic
that to have a debate  in  this  House  is  useless,  because  it  is  quite
important that as members of Parliament who represent society we  should  be
able to reflect on what exactly is going on in our society, so that  we  are
able to live up to our  responsibilities,  and  so  that  we  come  up  with
suggestions as to what should be done in relation to this particular issue.
Sensationalism and trying to score political points is not going to help  on
this issue. It needs all of us, as the Minister of Home  Affairs  has  said.
All the collectives should be challenged, and asked to  take  responsibility
and do something in relation to this issue.

The ANC has suggested, through Ms Mnandi, that members of Parliament  should
be seen outside as one group, as members of Parliament and  not  as  members
of different parties, because it is quite important that when we  deal  with
an issue such as this, we are not seen  as  representing  what  our  parties
want.  On  this  issue  parties  should  not  try  to  gain  advantage   for
themselves, because here we are dealing with  issues  that  affect  society.
Nobody should say to himself or herself that he or she has  a  solution  and
is the only one able to resolve this problem.

When a 20-year-old woman is raped  and  tied  to  a  railway  track  at  one
o'clock in the morning, so that a train runs  over  her,  that  says  a  lot
about the society we are contributing towards. As South Africans, we  should
take responsibility  and  put  our  heads  together,  and  do  something  in
relation to this matter. I think that is the responsibility that  the  party
which has placed this issue before the House is calling for.

When members say that there is no political will, they are not  informed  as
South  Africans  or  as  members  of  Parliament.  They   are   not   taking
responsibility for or  reflecting  honestly  on  what  is  happening  within
society. They  are  not  acknowledging  the  responsibility  that  different
Ministers are taking. Even the Deputy President  spends  most  of  his  time
going from house to house, trying to ensure that he speaks about  the  issue
of moral regeneration. He tries to ensure that he speaks about  issues  that
affect our young people.

Those members are addressing political issues. They are not really  applying
their minds to what we are supposed to do together to  resolve  this  issue.
As Azapo has said, the issue should not be what particular  political  party
has done what, but how we as a society resolve this situation  that  we  are
confronted with.

Recommendations have come from  the  task  group.  Madam  Speaker  has  even
called on different parties to participate in the  task  group.  This  shows
how important we regard this issue. We are not just relating to it  for  the
sake of scoring political points, but because we are looking for a  solution
within society.

When the Deputy President goes on his campaign for  moral  regeneration,  he
does so because he is committed to  finding  solutions  within  society  and
within the different structures that have been created by civil society  and
NGOs, to see what they can contribute to what Government has  been  able  to
establish on the ground. That is the type of responsibility that  is  needed
from South Africans.

What do  we  say  as  South  Africans?  Let  us  put  aside  party-political
responses, such as demanding death row, and take responsibility  by  saying:
``What can I do to contribute to this issue and help to  resolve  it?''  The
children we are talking about are members' children and  my  children;  this
can happen to anybody. Nobody is sending the criminals out at  night  to  go
and hunt our children, but we have a responsibility as  South  Africans  and
as politicians to do something.

When the Deputy Minister takes the responsibility  of  leaving  the  country
and going to the UK to see how the latest technology relates to  pornography
and the Internet, it  means  that  Government  is  taking  this  issue  very
seriously. It is not engaging  with  this  issue  just  to  score  political
points, but because it is looking for a solution.

When the Cabinet reflects on this issue and establishes a committee to  take
responsibility  in  relation  to  this  matter,  it  shows   how   committed
Government and the ANC are to resolving this issue. We as the ANC have  come
to this podium to support the efforts that are being undertaken to show  how
much our Government is contributing to confronting this issue. All of us  as
South Africans should take responsibility, hold hands and march together  to
find a solution, because we do not want to say that we are the ones who  are
going to provide the solution.

We do not want to defend the police and say that they are doing  good  work,
but they are definitely doing good work because they work through the  night
to protect every citizen in South Africa and make sure they feel  protected.
But they definitely do not have the capacity to go into houses  to  see  who
is raping whom at what time. They acknowledge that the resources  that  they
have  are  not  enough  and  they  are  not  able  to  address  this   issue
efficiently. However, they are committed and hard-working.

Sometimes they are confronted with these issues when they see  children  who
have been raped. Everybody needs to acknowledge the trauma that they  suffer
when they are confronted with such matters. They need a lot  of  support  to
enable them to handle these issues. This  means  that  while  resources  are
short and while the department  is  trying  to  prioritise  these  types  of
crimes, the police call on  members  of  Parliament  and  members  of  civil
society to take responsibility and assist them. They are also  human  beings
and have responsibilities, and they also have  children.  When  they  see  a
child who has been raped, they cannot  tolerate  it.  They  cannot  continue
reflecting on that.

It is in our interest as South Africans to put our hands and minds  together
to support each other and make sure that we find solutions to  what  we  are
confronted with.

The task group says that we should ensure that we  integrate  the  different
programmes  and  resources  of  Government,   and   follow   an   integrated
developmental strategy so that the department is able to address this  issue
in  an  integrated  manner.  We  should  also  ensure  that  the   different
Government agencies dealing with this issue get together to  find  solutions
on how to address this, so that the resources of the  different  departments
are brought together, and we are able to address this scourge  that  we  are
talking about. We need  to  put  our  hands  and  heads  together  and  find
solutions.

The police and everybody, also schools, should continue  making  the  public
aware of what they are being confronted with. This is the type  of  campaign
Nana Mnandi suggested again today. As members of Parliament, let us put  our
hands and heads together, let us  walk  together,  and  make  sure  that  we
confront this problem. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson,  comrades,  fellow  members
of the National Assembly, firstly, I would like to thank  the  hon  Minister
of Home Affairs for bringing this important motion to the House  today.  The
issue of child rape has received wide publicity in  recent  months  and  has
shamed this nation. This heinous crime is no longer  hidden  and  suppressed
to the extent that it was in the past. Few South Africans can now  claim  to
be unaware of its prevalence throughout our society.

A survey in the year 2000 reported by  the  Human  Rights  Commission  found
that in southern Gauteng alone, 20% of females and 13%  of  males  had  been
victims of sexual abuse before they turned 18. In the year 2001,  the  Human
Rights Watch found that on a daily basis,  in  schools  across  the  nation,
South African girls of  every  race  and  economic  class  encounter  sexual
violence and harassment at school that  impedes  the  realisation  of  their
right to education. Quite obviously, even amongst ourselves in  this  House,
there must be some of us who have encountered this in our lives.

The SAPS reported 15 510 cases of child rape during  the  year  2000  and  a
further 15 680  cases  during  the  year  2001.  These  reported  statistics
constitute a shockingly high incidence of rape in  our  country,  let  alone
the unqualified number of cases  that  remain  unreported.  Several  reasons
have been put forward to explain the widespread perpetration of child  rape.
Surely we cannot attribute this phenomenon only  to  poverty,  high-density,
crowded living conditions, unemployment and inadequate child  care.  Surely,
as Ms Mnandi has said here, there must be something else.

None of these explanations touched on the individual responsibility  of  the
child rapist or the crime that he or she commits. Whatever  one's  material,
social or environmental circumstances, it is the individual  who  makes  the
decision to rape a child, and who motivates himself  to  commit  a  shocking
crime of this nature. That is where the  ultimate  responsibility  lies  and
should lie. That is the root of the problem that  we  have  to  tackle:  the
basic  and  fundamental  moral,  ethical  and  spiritual  values   of   that
individual have to  be  addressed.  However,  one  cannot  legislate  for  a
person's morality. This is why we as Government are  so  serious  about  the
need for moral regeneration at a personal and community level.

It is critical for individuals and groups to be  able  to  distinguish  very
clearly between what is  right  and  permissible,  and  what  is  wrong  and
unacceptable in our social life. Whose role is it then to promote  morality?
Clearly, the family has a fundamental  role.  Where  better  can  one  learn
moral values than from one's own parents or extended  family?  Our  examples
as parents will dictate to our children how  they  should  behave.  The  sad
reality is that in many cases families  are  dysfunctional  for  a  host  of
historical, political and social reasons, and are  unable  or  unwilling  to
fulfil this role.

The next locus of  responsibility  is  civil  society  and  faith-based  and
community organisations. Civil society needs  to  be  proactive  in  helping
those who cannot help themselves. We  as  individual  members  of  churches,
mosques, temples, synagogues, sports clubs, youth clubs, women's  and  other
community organisations need to be on the look-out  for  potential  problems
in our social environment. As responsible members of civil  society,  it  is
our duty to intervene, and facilitate the necessary support  and  assistance
for affected families and individuals in our communities.

A large proportion of child rape cases occur in schools, perpetrators  being
the so-called teachers. Many take place within homes, with  adult  relatives
or friends taking advantage of defenceless children.  Often  rapes  are  not
reported for fear of reprisals or further victimisation. We must put a  stop
to this.

How are we to recognise child victims of rape? Research shows  that  victims
are usually aged between the ages of 8 and  16.  They  often  lack  parental
supervision and may have an unstable home environment  and  poor  ties  with
their families. They might be underachievers and members of  low-to-average-
income households. They are probably subject to abrupt  mood  and  behaviour
changes. They might be seekers of attention, praise and approval, and  might
also be inexplicably and unexpectedly in possession of  more  money  or  new
toys and clothes, and are likely to be withdrawn from  their  normal  family
or peer groups.

What about the perpetrators of child rape? There is a good chance that  they
would be in possession of sexually explicit material such as  photos,  books
and magazines with which to lower the inhibitions of the victims  whom  they
want to attract. They may even  be  well  liked  in  the  neighbourhood  and
arouse no suspicion. They often do not appear to be the type of person  that
can be a threat to society.

As communities and individuals, we must be perceptive  and  alert  to  these
symptoms and report any suspicions to the police, Government departments  or
organisations that deal with children. As Government we are obliged  to  put
in place all the protective legislation that  is  necessary  to  shield  our
children from rape or any other form of abuse. South  Africa  does  in  fact
have a comprehensive child protection  policy  and  statutory  framework.  A
framework is set out primarily in the South African  Constitution,  as  well
as in several international instruments and domestic legislation.

South Africa has acceded to the UN Convention on the  Rights  of  the  Child
and other international conventions such  as  the  African  Charter  on  the
Rights  of  the  Child.  Thereby  we  committed  ourselves  to  taking   all
protective, legislative, administrative, social and educational measures  to
protect the child  from  physical  or  mental  violence,  injury  or  abuse,
neglect, negligent treatment, maltreatment and exploitation in our  society.
Section 28 of our Constitution  guarantees  every  child  the  right  to  be
protected from maltreatment, neglect and abuse.

There is a national plan of action for children in South Africa which  makes
specific provision for the protection of children.  This  was  endorsed  and
launched  by  Cabinet  on  31  May  1996.  National  legislation  aimed   at
protecting children from sexual abuse exists. The  revised  children's  Bill
that is currently going through the legislative process will make  provision
for a child protection register for both victims and perpetrators  of  child
rape and other forms of abuse.

Already section 32 of the  existing  Child  Care  Act  obliges  professional
social  workers,  teachers  and   medical   health   personnel   to   report
circumstances giving rise to suspicion that a child a has been  ill-treated.
These people are indemnified  from  legal  proceedings  in  respect  of  any
notification given in good faith. Section 4  of  the  Prevention  of  Family
Violence Act of 1993 contains a similar provision.

The purpose of the proposed child protection register will be  to  link  the
child and family as quickly  as  possible  to  a  social  work  service;  to
centralise the notification of suspicion of ill treatment; to register  each
suspicion of ill treatment; to ensure follow-up protection of the child;  to
use information for research data; to  influence  welfare  planning,  budget
allocation, law and policy;  to  keep  information  on  legal  action  taken
regarding the child and convicted perpetrator; and to share the  information
amongst professional persons if that would serve the best interests  of  the
child.

The Department of Social Development is in the process of computerising  the
child  protection  register,  following  a  pilot  programme  that  was   in
operation for one year. The second phase of finalising the programme  is  at
an advanced stage.

Finally, the department's  victim  empowerment  programme  is  developing  a
service directory to be utilised by police officers and other  professionals
for referral purposes. The programme provides counselling  and  support  for
victims and is striving to ensure the availability of  shelter  for  victims
of violence.

My appeal is that, regardless of political persuasion, we  should  all  work
together to eliminate this horrendous and abominable scourge of  child  rape
and abuse from the social landscape. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to.

                       HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, hon members, the Minister  of
Education apologises for his absence from this House today. He is  taking  a
short break on the advice of his doctors.

There can be little doubt  that  within  the  broad  canvas  of  educational
change and transformation, this year has been the year of higher  education.
Cabinet's approval of the Ministry's proposals  for  the  restructuring  and
transformation of the institutional landscape of  higher  education  in  May
2002 has set the stage for the  implementation  of  the  framework  for  the
reconstruction and development of the higher education system,  as  outlined
in the national plan for higher education.

The ensuing debate,  including  the  legal  challenge  to  the  Government's
proposal to establish a  single  dedicated  distance  education  institution
through the merger of Unisa, Technikon SA and the distance education  campus
of Vista University, has placed the restructuring  of  higher  education  at
the centre of the public discourse on  education.  However,  despite  recent
media assertions that there  is  massive  opposition  to  the  restructuring
proposals, interactions with a number of higher education  institutions  and
constituencies in the past few months generally suggest  widespread  support
for the proposals.

In this regard, we are pleased to announce that the  council  of  Unisa  has
withdrawn its legal challenge, and therefore the establishment of  a  single
dedicated  distance  education  institution   is   back   on   track.   More
importantly, despite a last-minute attempt to  prevent  it,  the  ML  Sultan
Technikon  and  Technikon  Natal  were  successfully  merged   and   a   new
institution, called the Durban Institute of Technology, was  established  on
1 April this year.

We are confident that the restructuring and transformation agenda is  firmly
in place, and that future generations will graduate  from  higher  education
institutions that owe no allegiance to the geopolitical imagination  of  the
apartheid planners.

The main reason for introducing the  amending  Bill  is  to  facilitate  the
implementation of the  higher  education  restructuring  and  transformation
agenda.  As  indicated  to  the  House  before,   the   unfolding   of   the
restructuring  and  transformation  process  which  has  resulted   in   the
identification and clarification of gaps in  the  policy,  has  necessitated
the review and amendment of the Higher Education Act.

The amending Bill has two purposes. The  first  is  to  introduce  technical
amendments to clarify and bring legal certainty to  issues  related  to  the
merger of institutions, such as the authority to merge institutions and  the
attendant labour relations implications, as well  as  the  implications  for
students in terms of rules and regulations governing academic programmes.

The second main purpose is  to  introduce  amendments  that  streamline  and
strengthen the governance structures of higher  education  institutions.  We
will focus mainly on the second set of amendments. Good  governance  is  the
cornerstone of a well-functioning higher education system. It is  the  lever
that enables the pursuit of academic freedom and institutional  autonomy  in
the context of public accountability. The existence of properly  constituted
and functioning councils  is  essential  to  ensure  that  higher  education
institutions are able to respond to the  demands  of  public  accountability
and, in particular, to demonstrate financial probity and their  capacity  to
meet national policy goals and priorities. This is, however,  sadly  lacking
in a number of our higher education institutions.

The absence of good  governance  is  in  large  measure  a  product  of  the
composition of institutional councils  which  are  unnecessarily  large,  in
some cases comprising up to 50 members, and very unwieldy. This is  the  end
result  of  the  post-1994  flourish  of  democracy,  with  its   focus   on
transforming  undemocratic  and  unrepresentative  councils.   However,   in
invoking the spirit of democracy, little or no attention  was  paid  to  the
impact of large councils, representative  though  they  may  have  been,  on
efficiency and effectiveness. In particular,  little  or  no  attention  was
paid to ensuring that councils had the  necessary  expertise  to  deal  with
their academic, educational, legal and fiduciary responsibilities.  Although
the department has initiated a training programme for  council  members,  it
is clear that the necessary expertise is the product of the accumulation  of
social capital, which the  majority  of  our  people  have  been  denied  by
apartheid. In the light of this,  the  amending  Bill  limits  the  size  of
institutional councils to  a  maximum  of  30  members,  while  keeping  the
principle that at  least  60%  of  the  members  must  be  external  to  the
institution.

The amending Bill also increases the size  of  interim  councils  which  are
established to facilitate the merger of higher education  institutions  from
the current five to a minimum of five or a maximum  of  nine  members.  This
amendment similarly seeks to  ensure  that  the  size  of  interim  councils
provides  for  the  expertise  necessary  to   discharge   their   functions
efficiently and effectively.

The interim councils are transitional bodies  necessary  to  facilitate  the
merger of higher education institutions. They have specific functions and  a
limited shelf life of six months, renewable only for a further  six  months.
Except for the chairperson, members of the  interim  council  are  appointed
from nominees submitted by the affected institutions.

Although the chairperson is appointed by  the  Minister,  there  is  nothing
preventing the  affected  institutions  from  submitting  nominees  for  the
chairperson's position for consideration by the  Minister.  The  point  that
must be  emphasised  is  that  interim  councils  function  under  the  same
authority and autonomy as normal institutional councils.

There  is  a  critical  issue   that   underpins   the   restructuring   and
transformation agenda but which is not addressed in the amending Bill.  This
is the issue of access, both in terms of increasing the  participation  rate
in higher education as well as ensuring that there is equity in access.  The
national plan for higher education indicated that  race  and  gender  access
would be facilitated by the establishment of  a  national  higher  education
information and application service, which would have a number of  benefits,
including providing data on the available  pool  of  applicants,  satisfying
the information  needs  of  applicants  on  available  study  opportunities,
providing  career  guidance  and  information,  as  well  as  enabling   the
Government to monitor progress in achieving race and gender access.

We are therefore pleased to announce that the  working  group  appointed  to
investigate the development of  an  appropriate  model  for  establishing  a
national higher education information and application service has  submitted
its report.  The  report  is  being  released  for  public  comment  and  we
anticipate that the service itself will be  established  in  the  course  of
next year.

In conclusion, we are confident that the amending Bill,  together  with  the
other processes that are in place to implement the national plan for  higher
education, moves us ever closer  to  the  goal  of  establishing  a  single,
national,  co-ordinated,  high-quality,  higher  education  system  that  is
affordable and responsive to the human resource and knowledge needs  of  our
country. [Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Chairperson, the Bill before us seeks to amend the  Higher
Education Act, Act 101 of 1997. The Bill amends the principal Act so  as  to
provide for consequential matters arising out of  declarations  and  mergers
of public higher education institutions.

The Bill furthermore provides for  changes  in  the  size  of  councils  and
institutional forums, the appointment of an administrator to take  over  the
functions of a council which is deemed  to  have  resigned,  the  Minister's
authority to make regulations and certain textual alterations.

The  committee  heard  submissions   from   the   following   representative
organisations: the National Education, Health and Allied  Workers  Union  or
Nehawu;  the  SA  Qualifications  Authority;  the  Committee  of   Technikon
Principals; and the SA Universities Vice-Chancellors Association.

All presenters agreed to the Bill's principles provided  some  modifications
were made. Nehawu focused on the implications  of  the  Bill  for  employees
that would be affected by the transformation.  The  Committee  of  Technikon
Principals and  the  SA  Universities  Vice-Chancellors  Association  agreed
largely with Nehawu. Both bodies accepted the Bill's  proposition  that  the
size of councils be limited to 30.

They expressed concern over the default limit on  borrowing.  The  Director-
General of the Department of Education explained that  the  5%  default  was
not absolute  and  that  the  Minister  would  act  in  good  faith  in  his
determination  of  application  for  borrowing  by   the   public   tertiary
institutions. The DP looks forward to the hon the  Minister  honouring  this
promise, as many institutions do need bridging funds  at  the  beginning  of
the year.

The SA Qualifications Authority's view  was  that  any  national  curriculum
process must be inclusive of key  education  and  training  interest  groups
within  the  bands  and  across  the  bands,  to  ensure  that   issues   of
articulation are addressed at all levels. Should this not  be  achieved,  we
submit, the concept of an integrated  approach  to  education  and  training
would be lost. The current Bill reflects no reference to  any  process  that
the Minister might need  to  follow  in  producing  the  national  curricula
statements. This matter, we suggest, needs to be revisited.

Clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill relate  to  labour,  student  matters  and
consequential issues as a result  of  declarations  and  mergers  of  public
higher education institutions.  These  amendments  attempt  to  clarify  and
bring legal certainty  to  issues  that  the  Act  is  currently  silent  or
ambiguous on.  These  include  the  following.  Firstly,  they  provide  for
transitional arrangements relating to the  academic  programmes  offered  by
institutions  prior  to  a  merger.  Provision  is  made  to  enable   these
programmes to be offered by  the  new  institutions  under  the  same  rules
applicable to the  old  institutions  until  the  new  council  amends  such
programmes.

Secondly, there  is  a  potential  legal  uncertainty  with  regard  to  the
applicability of section 197 of the new Labour  Relations  Act,  Act  66  of
1995, in relation to  the  Higher  Education  Act,  Act  101  of  1997.  The
amendment seeks to make it clear that the law  will  automatically  transfer
all contracts of employment to the new institution.

Currently, the Act provides that the merged  institution  is  deemed  to  be
established  as  a  higher  education  institution  and  that  the  Minister
therefore  has  the  authority  to  take  such  decisions.  Clarity  on  the
authority to take the decision  to  merge  and  give  a  name  and  physical
location to the new institution is provided in the amendment.

Clearly, this Bill addresses,  as  indicated  above,  consequential  matters
arising  out  of  declarations  and  mergers  of  public  higher   education
institutions, and the DP will support the Bill.

Mr S B NTULI: Chairperson, hon Ministers and Deputy  Ministers,  colleagues,
members of  the  public  in  the  gallery,  departmental  officials,  Deputy
President, hon Minister  Prof  Kader  Asmal  in  absentia,  and  hon  Deputy
Minister of Education Mr Mangena, the amendments  of  the  Higher  Education
Bill represent a vital step. They will certainly leave  their  mark  on  our
education system.

An objective of the amendments to the Higher Education Act is,  among  other
things,  to  accelerate  the  transformation  of  higher  education  in  our
country. Perhaps one should take members back to where  we  come  from  with
the history of education, that is, as far back as  to  the  1950s,  just  to
refresh our memories.

The notorious Bantu Education Act of 1953  was  designed  to  eradicate  the
influence of independent churches and mission schools. Most importantly,  it
was designed to provide Africans with a cheap form  of  mass  education  and
training, geared towards the production of a subservient labour  force.  The
Bantu  Education  Act  of  1953  legislated  for  the  separate  funding  of
Africans, Indians, whites, coloureds, etc, as reflected in  the  budget  for
national education then, with the funding for Africans being the smallest.

Bantu education did not end there; separate institutions for  the  different
race and ethnic groups were built, corresponding to  the  establishment  and
promotion  of  homelands.  One  thus   had   KwaZulu,   KwaNdebele,   Venda,
Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, etc.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: KwaZulu kuKwaZulu namanje. [KwaZulu is  called
KwaZulu even now.] [Laughter.]

Mr S B NTULI: Chairperson, bantu education provided a  legal  framework  for
the establishment of separate universities, colleges and technikons in  line
with  the  homelands  system.  Hence  we  saw  the  establishment  of   many
institutions in line with Bantustans under the apartheid regime.  Therefore,
the Higher Education Act, which we are seeking to amend today, is  aimed  at
bringing about the  necessary  transformation  in  higher  education.  Today
issues of equity are of paramount  importance.  A  new  process  to  restore
human dignity, respect and the development potential of  a  human  being  in
general and a student in particular should be realisable through this Act.

The amendments we as the ANC are seeking to effect are aimed at the  further
transformation of higher education. I will speak to  clauses  4  and  5  and
appeal to  university  councils,  university  rectors,  staff  associations,
student representatives, professors, workers and members of Nehawu  to  give
a correct and complete report to education stakeholders.

Clause 4, amending of section  21  of  Act  101  of  1997,  deals  with  the
employer and employee contract. It reaffirms that any  redeployment  of  any
employee as a consequence of the declaration is subject  to  the  applicable
labour legislation. It is therefore not true that this Government  does  not
care about staff, workers and the members  of  staff  associations  of  this
country. What we are going to do is in line with the labour  legislation  of
this country.
Secondly, regarding the  implementation  of  transformation,  I  will  again
refer to section 23 of Act 101 of 1997. The  new  subsection  2A  states  as
follows:


  ... any reployment of an employee as  a  consequence  of  the  merger  is
  subject to applicable labour legislation.

This means that labour law and labour agreements between  the  employer  and
the employees should still be respected, observed and followed.

The amendment of section 23 of Act 101 of 1997 goes even  further.  The  new
subsection 2A states as follows:


  If two or more public higher education institutions  are  merged  into  a
  single public higher education institution as contemplated in  subsection
  (1), all the rights and obligations between the old  employers  and  each
  employee at the time of the merger continue in  force  as  if  they  were
  rights and obligations between the new employer  and  each  employee  and
  anything done before the merger by or in relation to the old employers is
  considered to have been done by or in relation to the new employer.

Lastly, I want to emphasise that the new section 23 (2G) stipulates that:


  ... the old employer  may  undertake  rationalisation  of  its  workforce
  according to operational requirements in accordance with section  189  of
  the Labour  Relations  Act,  1995,  prior  to  the  date  of  the  merger
  contemplated in subsection (1).

Therefore, it is only we who can make a difference by making  sure  that  we
convey the correct message. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Mr Chairman, hon Ministers and hon members  of  the  House,
universities have always been wary of anything that might seem  to  them  as
encroaching on their autonomy. We support the autonomy of  higher  education
institutions. We are however equally supportive of the idea that change  and
transformation cannot be left to chance, hence  our  qualified  support  for
the restructuring of institutions of  higher  learning  which  is  currently
under public scrutiny.

This Bill is anticipatory in nature, as it seeks to make provisions,  should
mergers of higher education institutions take  place.  We  have  no  quarrel
with that.

The resistance from some groups within the institutions of  higher  learning
emanates from various and varied factors. Fear of  the  unknown  is  one  of
them. Another factor  is  the  fear  of  losing  jobs.  Of  course,  in  any
restructuring, including that of  institutions  of  higher  learning,  there
will be casualties.

We must point out, though,  that  our  remarks  must  not  be  construed  as
support for or against mergers of  higher  learning  institutions.  We  will
cross that bridge when  we  reach  it.  Contracts,  for  instance,  will  be
transferred to a merged institution. This is not to say that there  will  be
no casualties. Two institutions that are merging will  have  one  principal.
This is precisely what we suspect  might  be  the  cause  of  resistance  to
mergers by certain principals of higher education institutions.

Our  higher  education  institutions  in   general,   and   the   previously
disadvantaged ones in particular, have been unstable for a  long  time  now.
We do not intend going into the reasons for their instability. The  point  I
am making is that the provisions for the appointment of an administrator  to
institutions  which  are  suffering  from  malfunctioning  of  any  kind  is
welcomed by us. Likewise, we welcome the  fact  that  universities  must  be
protected against themselves from going into unredeemable overdrafts.

The IFP supports this Bill.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Mr Chairman, allow me to wish the  livewire  Minister  of
Education a speedy recovery.

The New NP supports the Higher Education Amendment Bill. However,  allow  me
to make a few observations. During the public hearings, the SA  Universities
Vice-Chancellors Association  and  the  Committee  of  Technikon  Principals
expressed their serious concern about clause 8 of  the  Bill,  which  amends
section 40 of the principal  Act.  Whilst  they  understand  the  Minister's
right to impose, in the public interest,  limitations  on  an  institution's
total borrowing, they object to the level of borrowing contemplated  as  the
default position. They argue that if  clause  8  is  implemented,  it  could
render some institutions inoperative during the first quarter when  bridging
funding is sought prior to  the  payment  of  the  Government  subsidy  that
commences only in April.

The Bill furthermore addresses matters emanating from possible mergers,  and
the previous speaker dealt with that very effectively.

The restructuring plan for higher education envisages a  national  institute
for higher education in Mpumalanga. It could  be  worthwhile  from  a  cost-
saving perspective to  use  the  two  satellite  campuses  of  the  Pretoria
Technikon in Witbank and Nelspruit as building blocks for the  new  national
institute of  higher  education.  Perhaps  the  steering  committee  or  the
department, which  will  oversee  the  merger,  should  negotiate  with  the
Pretoria Technikon in this regard.

The 4 October  deadline  for  final  comments  on  the  hon  the  Minister's
restructuring plan for higher education  has  expired.  No  one  doubts  the
necessity for rationalisation of the higher education  system,  but  various
institutions  have  voiced  serious  objections  against   specific   merger
proposals. Unisa's objection against a possible merger with Technikon SA  is
well known, although we appreciate the fact that they have  withdrawn  their
legal application. RAU's  objection  against  a  possible  merger  with  the
Witwatersrand Technikon also came to the fore lately.

Ek wil net drie opmerkings  hieroor  maak.  Die  Minister  en  sy  Adjunk  -
Minister moet asseblief deeglik besin oor die wenslikheid om  technikons  en
universiteite te laat  saamsmelt,  want  daarvoor  is  hulle  institusionele
karakters net te verskillend. Geen samesmelting sal slaag  as  dit  nie  die
goedkeuring van al die  betrokkenes  geniet  nie.  Taalpatrone  moet  in  ag
geneem word voordat 'n finale besluit oor samesmelting geneem word.

Ons steun die wysigingswetsontwerp.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[I just want to make three remarks about this. The Minister and  his  Deputy
Minister  must  please  carefully  consider  the   expediency   of   merging
technikons and universities,  because  their  institutional  characters  are
simply too different for that. No merger will succeed without  the  approval
of  all  the  stakeholders.  Language  patterns   should   be   taken   into
consideration before a final decision is made about a merger.

We support the amending bill. [Applause.]]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Mr Chairman, earlier speakers have referred  to  the  purpose
of this proposed amending Bill, and it should be clear that we  are  dealing
here with enabling legislation. Speakers have also dealt with the  substance
of the Bill, and have clarified the proposed changes to  the  existing  Act.
It is therefore superfluous for me to  dwell  at  length  on  these  aspects
during my limited time slot.

The UDM supports the amending Bill; it is as  simple  as  that.  Whilst  the
amending Bill in itself is enabling legislation, and not  controversial,  it
should be publicly emphasised  that  the  submission  of  memoranda  on  the
restructuring proposals per se, by  interested  stakeholders  by  4  October
2002, remains unaffected by the passing of this legislation.

In this context, I make bold to  appeal  to  the  Minister  and  the  Deputy
Minister to consider  very  seriously  submissions  expected  to  have  been
received from quarters where the restructuring proposals are  likely  to  be
frowned  upon.  I  am  not  referring  here  to  those  that  seek  to  halt
transformation. Restructuring efforts will succeed where it is seen  by  the
affected people as transformation towards better  service  delivery  in  the
field of tertiary education. However, wherever the  groundswell  of  opinion
in a particular region perceives of restructuring  as  counterproductive  it
will not be accepted without growing resistance.

Aside from formal submissions,  the  Ministry  is  urged  to  take  heed  of
growing public sentiment  against  the  restructuring  of  specifically  the
University of  Transkei  and  to  re-examine  the  plans  outlined  for  the
affected region as a whole. It would appear that senior  people  go  berserk
and picture the Matanzimas in their mind's eye when issues  around  the  old
Transkei are raised. I should  hope  that  the  people  with  the  executive
powers will rise above this kind of irrational behaviour.

While restructuring plans for the Eastern Cape may  make  logical  sense  on
paper, there appears to be a need to listen again,  perhaps  a  little  more
attentively this time, to the views of the  people  who  are  most  directly
affected by the proposed changes. [Time expired.]
Ms C DUDLEY: Chairman, the challenge for institutions  of  higher  education
to retain institutional relevance and intellectual integrity  is  of  utmost
concern, as institutions endeavour to make the  necessary  changes  required
by the new South Africa. It is inevitable that institutions will  fight  for
their survival, and in this respect  their  foundations  are  being  shaken,
while Government continues  to  impose  legislation  regardless  of  current
discontent.

The Bill's intent regarding incorporations  and  mergers  will  bring  about
personnel changes and faculty adjustment, while  financial  constraints  are
huge and student debt adds to the  potential  threat  of  transformation  to
previously disadvantaged institutions.

Although the Bill has reduced  the  potential  harm  of  employees  becoming
redundant at this stage, the original  wording  that  the  transfer  of  the
contracts  existent  under  the  old  ruling  would  take  place   ``without
employees' consent'', has given rise to concerns. While the  intent  of  the
department is yet to be revealed, legislation now gives  the  Minister  huge
powers to drive mergers.

This legislation appears  to  reduce  the  relatively  strongly  independent
character of higher education in South Africa  and  has  been  described  as
part of ``an ever-increasing trend towards centralising control''.

We need vibrant independent  pools  of  learning  in  our  nation,  and  not
sterile, centralised control which smothers and brings death.

The ACDP will not support this Bill. [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chair, the MF is glad to note the positive transition  that
the department is undergoing by earnestly addressing the imbalances  of  the
past in the sector. At the end of the day, the most  crucial  and  important
factor is the wellbeing of the child, no matter if  he  or  she  is  from  a
poverty-stricken or an affluent area.

Past injustices have to be  earnestly  addressed,  so  that  equity  may  be
reached in the education we are providing to each and every person. This  is
their  constitutional  right.  We  have  seen  the  education  sector  being
revamped  to  achieve  this.  The  merger   of   public   higher   education
institutions appears most favourable, and the  amending  Bill  brings  about
clarification and certainty to accommodate this necessity.

The changes, though  necessary,  have  been  a  strain  on  all  within  the
department and employed by the state within the sector. Teachers  especially
have been moved and exposed to a lot of changes, and changes,  as  we  know,
are not that easy.

At the end of the  day,  our  priority  is  to  deliver  our  constitutional
responsibility, which is to protect and  ensure  every  citizen's  right  to
education, and to ensure that  this  right  is  activated,  efficiently  and
effectively, throughout South Africa.

The MF  supports  the  Higher  Education  Amendment  Bill.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Voorsitter,  op  die  oog  af  lyk  hierdie  wetsontwerp  baie
onskuldig. Dit is  bloot  die  daarstelling  van  'n  wetsraamwerk  vir  die
samesmelting van tersiêre inrigtings.  Die  vraag  is  egter:  Wat  lê  hier
agter? Dit is die herskikking van die tersiêre landskap  aan  die  hand  van
die Minister, wat soos 'n skaakmeester pionne rondskuif.  Samesmelting  word
nou al wettiglik vasgelê, terwyl die Gerwel-verslag nog nie eers verwerk  is
nie.

Daar is twee groot leemtes in die  wetsontwerp:  Dit  maak  voorsiening  vir
personeel, vir die rade en vir kontrakte, maar van die belangrikste  aspekte
van  die  universiteite  word  nie  verskans  nie.  Wat  van  die  taal  van
samesmeltende inrigtings? Wat van die kulturele  etos  van  twee  inrigtings
wat tans verskil? Hoe gaan die  nuwe  daar  uitsien?  Inteendeel,  die  nuwe
artikel 23(3)(b) bemagtig die Minister om na oorlegpleging met die  betrokke
rade die tipe en naam van die inrigting te bepaal.
Artikel 12(d) magtig die Minister om regulasies uit  te  vaardig  oor  enige
beleidsaangeleentheid, soos die oorspronklike wet  bepaal.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, at first glance this Bill looks  quite  harmless.
It is simply the establishment of a legal framework for the amalgamation  of
tertiary institutions. However, the question is: What lies behind  this?  It
is the rearrangement of the tertiary landscape at the hand of the  Minister,
who is moving pawns around like a  chess  master.  Amalgamation  is  already
being legally entrenched, whilst the Gerwel report has  not  yet  even  been
processed.

There are two majur lacunae in this Bill: It makes provision for staff,  for
the councils and for contracts, but some of the most  important  aspects  of
the universities are not entrenched. What about the language of  amalgamated
institutions? What  about  the  cultural  ethos  of  two  institutions  that
currently differ? What will the new one look like? On the contrary, the  new
section  23(3)(b)  empowers  the  Minister,  after  consultation  with   the
relevant councils, to determine  the  type  and  name  of  the  institution.
Section 12(d) empowers the Minister  to  promulgate  regulations  about  any
policy-related matter, as the original Act determines.]

The tertiary landscape should be reshaped. That is necessary, but it  should
be done  using  a  bottom-up  process.  This  Bill  legalises  the  top-down
approach by the hon the Minister,  and  therefore  we  cannot  support  this
Bill. [Time expired.]

Mr B M  KOMPHELA:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  the  Bill  before  us  today
reaffirms the  process  of  transformation  of  education  in  the  country,
particularly higher education. The higher  education  terrain  has  been  an
immensely contested terrain, as part of the overall struggle for  democratic
and quality education for our people, particularly  the  African  people  in
the country.

Since the days of the separate universities there has  been  an  outcry  for
equal education, and for a movement away from separate  higher  institutions
of learning. The Bill today seeks to address the fact that there  should  be
equal universities, that are not separate.  Progressive  student  movements,
unions and all progressive forces in the country have tried, with  the  help
of the Higher Education Act, to force transformation of higher education  to
take place. Higher Education must provide the quality of education  that  is
going to respond to the needs of the country at this point in time.

South  Africa  is  at  the  crossroads  where  higher  education  should  be
transformed so as to be responsive to the present situation, so that it  can
be an  element  of  tackling  the  economy  of  this  country,  standard  of
education, nonracialism and nonsexism. At the level of higher  education  we
should be able to say  we  have  democratic,  nonracial  institutions  which
offer education for all in this country.  This  is  the  beginning  of  that
process in our institutions of higher learning.

One of the most important documents of the ANC, the RDP, contains  a  clause
stating that the higher education system  represents  a  major  resource  of
national  development  and  contributes  to  the  worldwide  advancement  of
knowledge, but its present structure is not  what  it  is  supposed  to  be.
Empowering through higher education can  only  take  place  at  universities
that are well equipped and well resourced, and aimed at  the  other  section
of the community. This Bill is beginning to address that. All of  us  should
be the army that is ready to tackle change in this country.

This Bill is also going to assist with capacity, by providing for  the  kind
of student cadres  that  will  be  produced  by  these  institutions.  These
institutions must be able to produce good researchers and  people  that  can
be taken out of the education system to be ready to  conform  to  the  state
environment. They  must  be  the  army  that  is  going  to  assist  in  the
reconstruction and  development  of  this  country,  as  required  by  their
institutions of higher learning.

There is an issue that I want to raise quickly  with  the  Deputy  Minister.
Last week we ended up at  the  the  old  University  of  Qwa-Qwa,  which  is
supposed to be incorporated into the University of the Free State. There  is
something going on there that is not correct. The  University  of  the  Free
State has gone there with arrogance, throwing around  its  weight,  and  has
told the University of Qwa-Qwa: ``Take it or leave it''.

I do not think that is the spirit in which these universities should  merge.
Many of the people,  eight  of  them,  have  already  been  given  severance
packages in the midst of this process of transformation. I do not think  the
ANC is supportive of that kind of move. That is not correct.

The ANC supports this wide-ranging transformation and it is a big  gain  for
our people in this country. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Mr Chairperson, I wish to  thank  all  the
hon members for their positive contributions, by and large,  except  for  Mr
Moorcroft who seemed to confuse the Higher  Education  Amendment  Bill  with
other education Bills. I suppose  that  if  he  went  and  read  his  speech
closely and related that to other Bills that were put before the  House,  he
will probably realise that he has misdirected himself.

However, as far as declaring a  national  curriculum  statement  for  higher
education is concerned, as he seems to suggest, we are not in a position  to
do that at the moment. We will definitely not legislate,  but  the  Ministry
intends to hold a higher education curriculum indaba  next  year,  to  which
all the universities and institutions of higher learning will be invited.

I wish to thank members and indicate that the inputs  that  they  have  made
here generally reflect  what  is  happening  out  there.  The  universities,
technikons  and  other  people  who  have  a  role  in  this  are  generally
supportive. They  realise  that  although  we  do  not  have  a  bad  higher
education system, we can make it better, and that is what we intend to do.

As far as details that we differ about are concerned, that will  be  handled
with the relevant  stakeholders  and  will  be  handled  as  sensitively  as
possible. We hope that when the submissions that have been  made  have  been
studied, they will be shared with all concerned  and  with  this  House.  We
hope that this country will ultimately get a higher  education  system  that
we can all be proud of and that will serve the new society  as  well  as  it
should. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                   INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  this  Bill  and  the  new
institutional structure that it introduces are the products  of  many  years
of development and work, and these developments could only have taken  place
after the advent of a democratic South Africa.

There are three main reasons why we have introduced the  Bill  and  proposed
changes to the structure, and formed the International Trade  Administration
Commission. The first is because of numerous international obligations  that
South Africa is now very much part of, ranging from the WTO through to  many
other conventions that exist and which we have recently acceded to. We  have
also, of course, entered into new and very  significant  agreements  in  the
form of the European Trade and Development Agreement and the SADC  agreement
and, as I shall come to shortly, the South African Customs Union  Agreement.
These changes in South Africa's ability to negotiate trade  agreements  mean
that our  administration  of  those  agreements  and  of  trade  had  to  be
improved, updated and modernised.

The second main reason for making the changes that we are proposing here  is
the changes that have  taken  place  within  the  Department  of  Trade  and
Industry itself. As members who are familiar with the department will  know,
we have in essence divided the  department  between  those  divisions  which
deal with policy and strategy, those divisions which are  service  providers
and interact with economic citizens, and  those  divisions  that  fulfil  an
adjudicating function but alongside that function provide  certain  critical
services to economic actors.

In this case, the new International Trade  Administration  Commission  would
fall  within  the  third  category  and,   alongside   the   Companies   and
Intellectual Properties Office, plays an adjudicative function and  provides
certain critical services to economic citizens. We  have  moved  certain  of
the functions from the DTI across to the new commission and this,  I  think,
will strengthen the coherence of its  functions,  for  example,  export  and
import permits, which are important, and rebate  provisions.  All  of  these
are then linked with the administration  of  the  trade  agreements,  and  I
think this will strengthen considerably the ability of  the  new  commission
to carry out investigations and  its  work  within  this  very  complex  and
difficult domain of international trade.

The third key area that caused us to make the changes and  bring  about  the
new commission, is what I believe to be a truly  historic  achievement,  and
that is the renegotiation of the Southern African Customs  Union  Agreement.
Many members may know that this is the oldest customs  union  in  the  world
today, dating back to 1910. So it is not far from a 100 years old.

But what was clearly the case, was that the members of the Customs  Union  -
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland and South Africa - were not all  equal
in the arrangements of that Customs Union. In  fact,  one  could  say  quite
frankly that South  Africa  entirely  dominated  that  Customs  Union.  This
increasingly created difficult problems for  us.  A  range  of  difficulties
occurred. There had been  an  assumption,  for  example,  that  anti-dumping
actions that were taken by South Africa were also applicable in  the  member
states. It took the trade policy review of the WTO to point out to  us  that
this was not the case, and that it was necessary for each  member  state  of
the Customs Union to have a national centre of its own that would deal  with
these actions.

But it was also the case that South Africa was making decisions  on  tariffs
without any obligation to have to consult with the other  member  states  of
the Customs Union. Accordingly, straight after  1994  we  embarked  on  some
very difficult negotiations  around  the  Southern  African  Customs  Union.
There were two areas that were of concern in these negotiations and  created
the most difficulty. The one was the issue I have just covered  -  the  fact
that in essence the Customs Union was not democratic and did not  allow  for
real economic integration and co-operation. Secondly,  the  revenue  formula
in  that  agreement,  from  South  Africa's  point  of  view,  led  to   the
possibility that we would be required to pay out funds that in fact had  not
been collected. We have now reached an agreement on that and the  agreement,
we hope, will be signed by the heads of state of the  Customs  Union  member
states on Monday, 21 October.
But, in setting up the International  Trade  Administration  Commission,  we
have created South Africa's own national  centre  that  will  undertake  the
economic evaluations and investigations that are necessary in  our  economy,
within a clearly defined space allocated to it. At the same time  procedures
are set out for how these decisions will interact  with  the  structures  of
the Southern African Customs Union. In this way, I believe, we have  brought
about an important new and innovative  structure  of  economic  co-operation
and integration. This is no doubt the first of its  kind  in  Africa  and  I
think  is  likely  to  form  a  model  for  future  structures  of  economic
integration and co-operation of this type.

I believe we have also introduced new and important  provisions  which  will
make policy more transparent and place an obligation on Ministers,  if  they
wish to  announce  policy  provisions,  to  announce  them  in  writing  and
clearly, so that all persons are aware of them. It also, I think,  clarifies
considerably the fact that any decision taken at  the  Customs  Union  level
will also then be gazetted, so that all actors in the South African  economy
will be aware of that.

Chairperson,  colleagues,  I  would  be  particularly  like  to  thank   the
committees, both in this House and in the  National  Council  of  Provinces,
for the hard work they have done on this Bill and for the very  constructive
amendments they have made, which, from the department's point of  view,  are
improvements to the Bill. I would urge all parties in this House to  support
this important new change and modernisation of South  Africa's  increasingly
dynamic trading environment. [Applause.]

Prof B TUROK:  Chairperson,  we  thank  the  Minister  for  the  very  clear
elaboration of the purposes of the Bill. I  think  one  wants  to  emphasise
that what is actually happening is that a new  administrative  structure  is
going to replace the Board on Tariffs and Trade. This  is  going  to  be  an
important structure which  needs  considerable  attention.  It  particularly
deserves  attention   because   the   International   Trade   Administration
Commission is going to be accountable to Parliament,  and  therefore  we  do
need to keep an eye on what is happening.

Of very  great  importance  is  that  the  new  commission  will  strengthen
regional integration in SADC. This is obviously a  major  objective  of  the
Government, Nepad and all of us. We have made a commitment as Parliament  to
it, and therefore regional integration is something to which we have to  pay
a great deal of attention.

We understand that the creation of the body is linked to  the  new  Southern
African Customs Union Agreement,  which  embraces  South  Africa,  Botswana,
Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia. This agreement is under way and we  will  no
doubt be hearing a great deal more about it.

One has to say that the commission is designed to be  independent.  It  will
do investigations  and  make  recommendations  on  changes  in  tariffs  and
related matters. It will have powers with regard to the imposition of  anti-
dumping duties and safeguards against subsidies or disruptive competition.
Now, from the point of view of the  portfolio  committee,  this  is  clearly
largely an administrative Bill, but when we  looked  at  it  we  found  that
there were certain policy implications  which  deserved  our  attention.  We
were told ``ungakhathazeki'', ``kodwa ngikhathazekile'' because  there  were
certain concerns that did bother us in the field of policy. We looked at  it
fairly carefully and we think that the committee's deliberations did  enrich
the Bill, so let me report on that.

In clause 2, the objects of the Bill originally stated that the Bill was  to
foster economic growth and development of industry. We looked  at  that  and
we thought that was a rather narrow formulation. We  therefore  produced  an
amendment which says that the Bill  seeks  to  foster  economic  growth  and
development - it did not mention ``industry'' - in order  to  raise  incomes
and promote investment and employment in the Republic and within the  common
customs area. So, the shift we made  there  was  from  ``fostering  economic
growth and development of industry'' - we left  out  the  word  ``industry''
for reasons that I will come to in a minute, and we included the  notion  of
raising incomes and promoting investment and  employment  in  the  Republic.
That was one issue  that  we  took  up  and  spent  a  great  deal  of  time
discussing.

Then, on clause 5 ... [Interjections.]

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Is that the hard-left or the ultra-left agenda?

Prof B TUROK: The hon member is sitting on my left, so  he  ought  to  know.
Are you hard, soft or mediocre? Do tell us. [Interjections.]

Clause 5 originally said that the Minister may issue  policy  statements  or
directives. Some  objections  and  questions  were  raised  about  that.  We
therefore amended it as follows:


  The Minister may, by  notice  in  the  gazette  and  in  accordance  with
  procedures established by the Constitution or  any  other  relevant  law,
  issue trade policy statements and directives.
The reason we did that is that some people  were  saying  that  it  was  not
enough that the Minister  should  issue  trade  policy  statements.  Certain
informal consultative processes should be followed which  would  enrich  the
whole process and bring people on board. We also thought that a White  Paper
might be in place, dealing with the whole question of trade policy  and  how
statements and policy are made in this area.

Clause 6 of the original draft said that members of the commission  must  be
representative of a broad cross-section of the population of  the  Republic.
We thought that could be enriched as well. We therefore added  a  number  of
phrases which said that members of the commission should  be  representative
of a broad cross-section of the Republic, including women. It was the  women
members of our committee who  said  that  referring  merely  to  the  cross-
section was not enough, that in terms of the Constitution  of  South  Africa
and according the present views of Parliament and all of  us,  there  should
be a special mention of women.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: That is too soft.

Prof B TUROK: Would the hon member like me to reply to him? [Laughter.]

Then we said that the President must endeavour to ensure  the  participation
of significant economic sectors. This is in line with the previous  point  I
was making, that this Bill covers not only industry, but also areas such  as
agriculture. Since trade  in  this  region  and  indeed  elsewhere  includes
agriculture on a significant scale, we  thought  it  better  to  ensure  the
participation of significant economic sectors, which would thereby allow  us
to include agriculture.

On clause 22  we  had  rather  significant  representation  from  the  South
African Chamber of Business. The hon Bruce has arrived. Maybe I  should  say
that the hon Bruce often comes as the spokesman of business. I have  noticed
one thing about him, and that is that when it comes to business no  one  can
say that the hon Bruce is a yes-man.  He  is  not  a  yes-man  because  when
business says no, he also says no. [Laughter.]

In this discussion we had representations from Sacob and they  said,  and  I
quote:


  The acceptance of the Bill and its passage into law in its  present  form
  would have negative consequences as a result of inevitable delays.

They harped a great deal on the  possible  inefficiencies  that  would  come
into this commission if we passed the Bill in that form. Our view  was  that
we  could  hold  regional  integration  and   the   building   of   regional
institutions, and also  allow  South  Africa  to  be  the  sole  arbiter  of
decisions on trade relations. Therefore,  we  thought  the  Bill  should  go
ahead; if necessary, changes could be brought to the NCOP.  But  we  thought
that the Bill was fine. We did strengthen clause 22  somewhat  in  order  to
make the whole process stronger, and I would just like to report on that.

Clause 22(3) says that the chief commissioner must submit  to  the  Minister
an annual report. Therefore there would be a way of monitoring the  activity
of the commission, even though it is independent and so  on.  Subclause  (c)
says that the commission  must  submit  a  report  on  its  performance  and
activities. We thought that including the phrase ``the  performance  of  the
commission'' would be a safeguard  against  possible  undue  delays  and  we
hoped that would satisfy Sacob. I think it did.  Whether  it  satisfied  the
hon Bruce, we shall hear in a moment. I look forward to his  performance;  I
hope it will not be an aria.

Finally, the  Minister  may  table  in  Parliament  other  reports,  also  a
statement of progress achieved, and this seemed to indicate to us that  this
Bill would allow for considerable oversight on our part and on the  part  of
the Minister. Therefore  we  propose  that  the  House  should  support  it.
Whether the hon Bruce will do that, we will hear in a moment. [Applause.]

Mr N S BRUCE: Chairman, the hon Ben Turok, thank you for that  introduction.
I am, generally speaking, quite proud to speak on behalf of  business.  When
it comes to Sacob and Mr Kevin Wakefield however -  Wakeford,  Wakefield,  I
can never remember - I think the member has it a little wrong. It  has  been
a long afternoon; we have started with child rape and we  have  gone  on  to
education, and the ayatollah is not here to defend  himself,  so  I  do  not
want to keep members too long on a Bill such as this.

Let me tell the Minister right from the start that we will not  oppose  this
Bill. We think when the hon Turok said ``we'' he actually  meant  ``I''  for
most of what he said, but be that as it may, this  Bill  appears  to  us  to
provide  a  more   efficient   legal   and   regulatory   architecture   for
international trade, especially so far as the Customs  Union  is  concerned.
But until it is operative we will not really know how well it  achieves  its
purpose.

Much will depend on how the Minister applies his powers  of  regulation  and
how it is implemented  by  DTI  officials  and  their  counterparts  in  our
trading  partners.  The  certainty  of  the  regulatory   environment,   the
implementation of policy under its aegis, and the depths of its  vision  are
all important if this economy  is  to  become  more  efficient  and  thereby
foster investment, growth and jobs.

There is an administrative need  to  ensure  that  dogma  does  not  distort
advantage. For instance, we have become  well  known  as  one  of  the  most
active countries in invoking anti-dumping laws. This is all very  well,  but
at times dumping  keeps  prices  down  and  it  should  not  be  used  as  a
substitute for protection.

In this regard, it was salutary to learn from the legal profession that  the
DTI's new Companies and Intellectual Registration Office or Cipro is  to  be
run, advised and consulted by a  former  oil  executive,  Rob  Angel,  known
affectionately as Gabriel to his friends. His qualifications  for  the  job,
however, are abysmal. He has great experience, is  white,  English-speaking,
middle-aged and male. But I hear he is married into the ANC, clearly  either
a man of sagacity, ambition or good taste, or all three.

Can the hon the Minister find someone else equally  abysmally  qualified  to
run this new DTI division or whatever it is now going to be  called?  Always
assuming, of course, that they have married  into  the  ANC?  There  is  Ken
Owen, ``Hony Turd'', Dave Dalling - what untold talent is at the  Minister's
behest. None of them, however, I think, holds  a  candle  to  the  Archangel
Gabriel.

Trade policy is of particular moment now as rising food prices  are  in  the
headlines, and the Competition Commission has been told to find out  why.  I
cannot think of a more misplaced brief. Our current  inflation  has  nothing
to do with private sector prices determined in competitive markets.  It  has
everything to do with prices administered by Government and by  the  decline
in the value of the currency.

Worldwide food prices are rising. Our antidote is to remove what is left  of
protection for agricultural producers and to persuade  developing  countries
to dump their surplus food in our markets. Our  agricultural  industry  will
become more efficient and consumers will benefit mightily.

But that is not all. The decline in the  value  of  the  rand  is  the  real
culprit. And that plunge is not new. It has  not  just  happened,  as  Kevin
Wakeford would have us believe. Look at the Reserve Bank's  annual  economic
report, page 51. It shows that since 1994 the index has fallen from  120  to
about 40 - a massive erosion of capital value.

That is no speculative flash in the pan. It is a long and sustained vote  of
no confidence in this country's ability to provide investors  with  adequate
returns. Stop the rand falling and one will  stop  food  prices  rising.  If
Government believes it cannot  stop  the  currency  falling,  then  a  basic
income grant is unavoidable, and will become increasingly so.

The rand's prolonged plunge, and the absence of investment that it  implies,
is  a  clear  vote  of  no  confidence  in  this   Government's   inadequate
empowerment, labour and economic policies. Now  the  currency  needs  to  be
nurtured back to where it was years ago.

The way to do that is to go for growth, to take advantage  of  the  shot  in
the arm the plunging rand  has  given  us  and  maximise  its  impact.  Keep
administered prices down. Give a commission the task of  investigating  what
needs to be done to reduce the cost of doing business. Use this new Bill  to
keep our borders open to cheap goods. Think, for once, of the consumer.

What we should not be doing  is  increasing  interest  rates.  Inflation  is
being caused, not by excessive demand, but by the  constantly  rising  costs
of essential imports, of which  food  is  one.  Monetary  policy  is  simply
constraining what temporary benefit we can get  from  a  soft  rand  without
doing anything to contain inflation.

Even  before  the  latest  increase,  interest  rates  were  too  high.  The
overdraft rate now should be  the  rate  of  inflation  plus  two  or  three
percent. It is not. Do members want to know  why?  It  is  simply  that  the
Reserve Bank has let the money supply rip. The first quarter  of  this  year
saw an annualised 32% increase in M3,  the  highest  quarterly  growth  rate
ever recorded.

A plunging currency, Chairman, is always only a shot in  the  arm.  And,  as
its impact diminishes, our  manufacturers  will  increasingly  be  producing
less at greater cost. [Time expired.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Chairperson, today we have  heard  about  the  hardliners,
the softliners - I do not know whether some people are  going  soft  in  the
head as well at this  stage.  Old  age  is  catching  up  with  all  of  us,
including me, so I do not excuse myself from that particular  aspect.  Today
I sometimes found  myself  very  much  in  agreement  with  the  hon  Bruce,
particularly when he  started  lashing  out  at  the  high  interest  rates,
inflation and the culmination of those particular aspects.

If we look at the Bill before us, we must bear in mind that South Africa  is
a developing nation. It is highly dependent on  international  and  regional
trade as one of the cornerstones of our economy. As we move  away  from  the
import substitution trade policies of the past and onto the path of  export-
led economic growth, the importance  of  international  and  regional  trade
cannot be overstated.

The accelerating pace of globalisation and the  progressive  elimination  of
trade barriers underline the fact that South Africa must at all times be  in
a position to take advantage of favourable trade  conditions.  An  efficient
and responsive trade regulatory system and competent trade institutions  are
preconditions for successful international and regional trade.

The  International  Trade  Administration  Bill  attempts  to  create   this
favourable trade environment by establishing a new body, the Commission  for
International  Trade  Administration,  or  Cita.  This  body  will   be   an
independent regulator of international trade agreements and  is  the  result
of a change in policy by the Department of Trade and  Industry  to  separate
its  implementation  functions  from  its  regulatory   and   administrative
functions. The  realisation  that  the  separation  is  required  should  be
welcomed. In essence, Cita  will  be  charged  with  the  investigation  and
adjudication of international trade applications or complaints within  South
Africa and will be  responsible  for  issuing  import  and  export  permits,
except in the case of certain military products that  are  controlled  under
separate legislation. Cita will also replace the existing Board  on  Tariffs
and Trade.

The second reason for the establishment of  Cita  is  to  be  found  in  the
obligations placed on South Africa in terms of the Southern African  Customs
Union Agreement with our regional trade partners.  The  new  SACU  Agreement
establishes a SACU  tariff  board,  which  will  be  dependent  on  national
institutions to support it, to formulate recommendations  on  common  tariff
and trade remedies. South Africa's new Cita will fulfil this role  when  all
SACU member states have sufficiently developed  their  structures  to  carry
out  their  functions  relating  to  customs  duties.  In  addition  to  the
functions carried out by the existing board, Cita will also  carry  out  the
following new functions, to mention but  a  few.  It  will  investigate  and
evaluate  allegations  of  dumping,  subsidised   exports   and   disruptive
competition; investigate  and  evaluate  applications  for  amended  customs
duties; investigate and evaluate issuing export and import control  permits;
and monitor and report to the Minister on relevant matters.

The IFP will support the International  Trade  Administration  Bill,  as  we
believe that the Cita established by this Bill will be a more effective  and
responsive trade regulatory body than the  existing  Board  on  Tariffs  and
Trade. Due to its independence and overarching functional area, it  will  be
an asset in  promoting  South  Africa's  international  and  regional  trade
relationships to the benefit of our economy.

Dr  R  T  RHODA:  Mr  Chairperson,  developments  in  the   world   economy,
particularly the trends towards  increasing  international  competition  and
globalisation, will have an enormous  impact  on  the  future  character  of
Southern African regionalism.

Today Southern Africa's most important institutional  arrangements  are  all
in a state of transformation  as  they  endeavour  to  respond  to  the  new
regional environment. SADC, Comesa and SACU have already adopted or  are  in
the process of renegotiating  new  constitutions.  We  come  from  nearly  a
century where customs tariffs were used solely for protection.  The  present
SACU agreement came into force in 1969. It is peculiar to our region and  is
widely regarded  as  the  most  effective  functioning  trade  agreement  in
Africa.

The origins of SACU date back to 1893. In the old days South Africa  pursued
a  highly  protectionist  policy,  designed  to  promote   industrialisation
through a combination  of  import  substitution  and,  in  the  late  1980s,
limited export-led growth. After 1991, a new policy  of  substantial  tariff
reform, focused on reducing levels of protectionism, was adopted. Today,  we
are on the threshold of a miracle.  South  Africa  exports  six  times  more
manufactured goods than 10 years ago.  We  are  today  one  of  the  world's
fastest growing car exporters. Today the best BMWs in the world are made  in
South Africa. Over the past five years our productivity  has  grown  between
4% and 6% as opposed to a growth of 2% to 3% in America. Our  national  debt
is decreasing, something unheard of in most developing countries.

South Africa's budget deficit is  now  smaller  than  that  of  any  of  the
world's seven top economies, excluding America.  Our  economy  continues  to
grow. We just need to continue believing in ourselves.

Amongst other things, the  Bill  creates  a  new  modernised  administrative
regime for the conduct of international trade. It is a  Bill  that  proposes
to establish how a member of SACU actually  conducts  a  trade  policy.  The
International Trade Administration Bill speaks to what the  arrangements  in
South Africa will be. Essentially what the Bill seeks to do  is  to  provide
an institutional  basis  for  the  conduct  of  new  trade  policy,  and  in
particular the application of customs tariffs, in line with  the  objectives
of South Africa's commitments to trade arrangements  with  the  World  Trade
Organisation. We provide an interface with SACU institutions.  We  make  the
legal and constitutional provisions, in very broad  terms,  to  Government's
democratic consultative relations with other countries  in  the  region,  in
other words, shared decision-making.

Until the SACU Agreement and the related protocols  and  procedures  are  in
force, those aspects of the Bill that refer to the interface with SACU  will
not be in force. This means that the current situation will  continue  under
this legislation  until  the  SACU  agreement  has  been  ratified  by  this
Parliament.

Sacob, Cosatu and Agri SA have all made valuable inputs  and  contributions,
and we have tried our best to  address  their  points  of  concern.  We  do,
however, need to look into the illegal dumping of second-hand clothing.  The
movement towards globalisation, particularly in the economic  sphere,  is  a
widely accepted phenomenon in international trade relations. Throughout  the
social sciences and more generally, led by the internationalisation  of  the
factors of production and  consumption,  the  process  of  globalisation  is
perceived to be eroding  the  sovereign  authority  of  states.  In  theory,
unfettered and uncontrollable markets are  the  world's  principal  economic
actors and agents of change.

This Bill is very worthy of being passed and therefore the  New  NP  has  no
objection in supporting it. [Time expired.]

Ms J MOLOI:  Chairperson,  hon  members  and  distinguished  guests,  it  is
important for South Africa continuously to evaluate and  improve  its  trade
policies in order  to  strengthen  its  domestic  growth.  Trade  enables  a
country to consume outside its  own  production  paradigm.  Similarly,  good
trade  policies  allow  countries  to  export  those  goods  that  they  are
efficient in producing, in order to import those goods that they are  unable
to produce. However, the mandates of these trade policies are influenced  by
the differences in the information and communication technology  and  labour
costs, as well as the institutional capacity of countries.

Since 1994 South Africa has gradually been  moving  from  an  inward-looking
economy to an outward-looking economy. These factors became  vital  for  our
performance in the international  trade  arena.  Openness  to  international
trade has lead to relative price increases in exports  and  a  fall  in  the
domestic import substitutes. Based on this, trade reforms were necessary  to
ensure  that  the  South  African  economy  becomes   more   efficient   and
competitive.

For the International Trade Administration Bill to have  an  impact,  it  is
important  for  countries  to  be  part  of  the  negotiations  where  broad
priorities could be translated into specific negotiation proposals.

The ANC is of the view that we need to draw in alliance partners that  share
the same objectives from Third World countries in order  to  strengthen  our
position to bring about development.  We  further  believe  that  this  Bill
should aim to  foster  economic  growth  and  development  that  will  raise
incomes, and promote investments and employment in  the  Republic  of  South
Africa and within the common customs area.

This can be done by establishing an efficient and effective system  for  the
administration of international trade, subject to this  Bill  and  the  SACU
agreement. The International Trade Administration Commission is therefore  a
step in the right direction. The Bill we are debating today  is  in  essence
an administrative aid and not  a  trade  policy.  It  therefore  has  a  new
mandate,  that  of  investigating  and  evaluating  the   alleged   dumping,
subsidised exports and disruptive competition,  and  the  investigation  and
evaluation of applications for the amendment of customs duties.

The department investigates, evaluates and determines applications  and  the
issuing  of  permits  in  respect  of  rebates   and   certification,   and,
critically, deals with monitoring, reviewing and reporting to  the  Minister
on matters that may be assigned to it from time to time.

We welcome the fact  that  this  Bill  allows  the  Minister  of  Trade  and
Industry to issue trade policy statements or directives, and  the  power  to
regulate imports  and  export  until  the  Southern  African  Customs  Union
Agreement  is  finalised.  I  am  sure  this  fact  has  been  stated  quite
effectively.

It should be emphasised that all  these  goals  can  be  realised  once  the
International Trade and Administration Commission is fully functioning,  and
this Bill seeks to do exactly that. This Bill provides  for  a  transitional
mechanism between the old  legislation  and  the  Southern  African  Customs
Union Agreement. Although evidence exists of dumping by  anti-export  buyers
and the effective rate of protection still remains high within  the  region,
South Africa remains committed to the  following:  The  strengthening  of  a
rules-based system;  a  continuous  negotiation  to  focus  on  development;
encouraging investment and development in the South;  addressing  imbalances
that exist within the  World  Trade  Organisation  rules;  enhancing  market
access for developing  country  exports;  and  ensuring  Africa's  effective
participation, both regionally and globally.

An outstanding feature of the  passage  of  this  Bill  is  the  process  of
engagement that was followed between the social partners within Nedlac.  The
Portfolio  Committee  on  Trade   and   Industry   welcomes   the   adequate
understanding of the impact of proposed measures and guidelines in terms  of
the developmental issues  by  the  social  partners.  However,  the  biggest
challenges that lie ahead of us remain the extent  to  which  we  can  yield
tangible benefits to  the  disadvantaged  people  in  general,  how  we  can
improve the position of women and the rural poor, and  how  we  can  enhance
growth through the common customs area  and  break  the  existing  cycle  of
poverty.

I would like to indicate that through its work the portfolio  committee  has
consciously mainstreamed gender in the development  of  this  Bill.  Through
its oversight role it will ensure that it  monitors  the  implementation  of
the Bill so that monitoring is not limited to a rating of the Bill.

In conclusion, I would like to congratulate  the  Department  of  Trade  and
Industry on  the  sterling  work  that  they  have  done  and  submitted  to
Parliament. I would also like to congratulate  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Trade and Industry on its continuous engagement,  and  more  especially  the
chairperson who has made sure that all the disputes  were  looked  into.  We
want to indicate that as the ANC we support this Bill.

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson and hon Minister, the UDM  supports  the  Bill.
The Bill does not deal  with  policy  but  rather  with  administrative  and
procedural issues. That is not to say that the Bill is not significant,  but
merely that it serves to  further  enhance  the  implementation  of  current
policy. What remains to be addressed in future  is  the  reform  of  the  SA
Customs Union.

However, in the meanwhile it is necessary to ensure that the  current  trade
across South African borders occurs in a  fair  and  equitable  manner.  The
Bill has been necessitated  by  the  increasingly  direct  role  that  trade
tariffs and liberalisation play in our domestic  economic  life.  Given  the
overwhelmingly complex nature of tariffs and trades within  the  context  of
the Southern African Customs Union the need  has  developed  to  update  the
administration of tariff policy, whilst bringing it  in  line  with  current
policy as well as international  trade  agreements  that  South  Africa  has
acceded to.

As the senior economic stakeholder in  the  Southern  African  region,  this
country has a duty to ensure that we lead the way in proper,  efficient  and
responsible trade. In this regard the onus is  on  this  country  to  ensure
that the necessary administrative and procedural mechanisms  are  in  place.
We cannot expect our partners in  the  Southern  African  Customs  Union  to
embrace reform if we do not lead by example. It  is  hoped  that  this  Bill
will enhance this transparency of trade  and  tariff  policy  administration
and enable greater scrutiny of these instruments.  The  requirement  is  for
the Minister to consult with Nedlac and the Cabinet seeks to ensure  greater
inclusiveness and accountability. However, ultimately,  accountability  must
include consulting with the elected representatives  of  the  South  African
people in general.

The Bill further provides  for  the  establishment  of  the  Commission  for
International Trade Administration. The commission will  replace  the  Board
on Tariffs and Trade. Besides taking over the  functions  of  the  Board  on
Tariffs and Trade, the Bill also charges the CITA  with  additional  duties.
These are to investigate and evaluate  allegations  of  dumping,  subsidised
exports, amendments of customs duties applications  and  issuing  of  rebate
permits. The CITA will also monitor,  review  and  report  on  trade  issues
within its ambit to the Minister of Trade and Industry.

We welcome this new arrangement and we want to support the Bill.

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, the Bill seeks to facilitate an  efficient  and
effective system for the administration of international  trade  within  the
framework of prevailing economic policy and the  SACU  Agreement.  The  Bill
also replaces the old Board on Tariffs and Trade whilst  at  the  same  time
transferring some of its functions to the  new  commission.  The  Bill  will
strengthen regional integration and harmonisation.

Concerns were raised by some union representatives that the  Bill  may  give
the Minister unfettered discretion to make  policy  without  consulting  key
stakeholders.  Although  the  department  felt   that   this   concern   was
unwarranted,  an  amendment  was  considered  to  cover  this  concern.   An
amendment has been introduced to make policy decisions more transparent.

Business representatives, on the other hand,  expressed  concern  about  the
tempo of the resolution of anti-dumping  complaints.  These  representatives
sounded nostalgic concerning the old policy  of  protectionism.  We  in  the
ACDP believe that it would be unthinkable for the Government  to  revert  to
the protectionism tendencies whilst at  the  same  time  fighting  for  more
openness in international trade. However, we urge the department  to  ensure
the speedy resolution of anti-dumping complaints.

The ACDP supports the Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, South Africa is trying to establish itself  as
a major global competitor. As competition is stiff, the  need  to  attain  a
favourable position in the global  economy  is  important.  However,  we  do
possess  a  number  of  talents  and  advantages  that  make  achieving   an
advantageous position in the global  market  a  great  possibility.  A  very
important mechanism in attaining this is a planned  system  of  conduct  and
methods that will assist the process. This Bill aims to outline the  conduct
for trade and the establishment of the necessary institutions to do so.

The MF notes the importance this Bill places on tariffs and how it  aims  at
correcting and modernising the system in order to increase transparency  and
scrutiny of tariff policy. This  will  promote  greater  responsibility  and
accountability, not only in this sector but also in other trade  sectors  in
relation to this Bill.

There is a great need  to  harmonise  trade  administration  and  this  Bill
appears to do so. Global trade administration  is  constantly  changing  and
being updated. South Africa needs to keep up with, or  rather  match,  these
changes, as the Bill seeks to do.

We have  commitments  to  global  obligations  issued  by  the  World  Trade
Organisation, the Southern African Development Community  and  Sacob.  There
is always an eye watching and we have to  maintain  the  good  international
relations we  have  maintained  to  date.  The  MF  deems  these  provisions
necessary. However, we note the challenges these may pose to  South  African
exporters and with regard to domestic competitiveness  among  other  things.
But the MF sees this as our first step.

The MF supports the International Trade Administration Bill.

Mrs F  MAHOMED:  Chairperson,  in  the  name  of  God  most  gracious,  most
merciful, friends and colleagues, it is important that South Africa's  trade
policy must underpin the broader  developmental  agenda  of  addressing  the
legacy  of  underdevelopment,  inequalities  and   gender   marginalisation.
Effective trade policies should raise incomes  and  employment,  and  manage
and regulate the flow of goods  in  the  region  and  on  the  rest  of  the
continent. This will subsequently improve the quality and lives of  ordinary
people.

It is imperative to encourage free and equitable trade between  nations,  so
that developing countries have the opportunities to exploit and  beneficiate
their own resources to promote their own economic developmental  agenda.  It
needs to be noted that very often the rich resources of the poor  South  are
indiscriminately utilised by the rich North. We need to guard against  that.
The WTO does not consider dumping to be an illegal practice, but it  accepts
the importing countries which take action against  such  countries  if  this
causes injury to the manufacturing industry  in  the  countries  of  import.
This can  be  addressed  by  regulating  unfair  trade  practices.  The  WTO
therefore  has  in  place  an  anti-dumping  agreement  that  sets  out  the
procedural and substantive  requirements,  and  allows  governments  to  act
against dumped imports in a manner which would normally be in  contravention
of the GATT principles of binding tariffs and nondiscrimination.

While we recognise the importance  of  maintaining  and  ensuring  that  our
obligations in respect of WTO and SACU commitments are not being  neglected,
we need to draw effectively on our natural resources and fully  exploit  our
own human resources in order to address the  disparity  between  the  ultra-
rich and the poorest of the poor.

South Africa is one of the first countries in the world to  enact  an  anti-
dumping law, and  trade  and  tariff  policies.  Its  readmission  into  the
international arena confirmed its commitment  to  competing  in  the  global
market according to WTO rules. The Bill will establish a  new  body,  to  be
known as the International  Trade  Administration  Commission.  I  will  not
actually give details, because I think many of our speakers have  done  that
already.

It  needs  to  be  noted  that  effective   information   dissemination   is
imperative.  South  African  importers  and  manufacturers  have   not   the
slightest clue of how to use an instrument to  address  unfair  competition.
Therefore  we  welcome  the  investigation,  evaluation   and   adjudication
procedures vested in  the  commission  to  disseminate  information  and  to
ensure that South Africans are empowered in this regard.

Clause 8(l)(c)  in  Chapter  3  specifies  that  the  commission  should  be
representative of a broad cross-section of the population of  the  Republic,
including a gender balance. This needs to be applauded.  It  is  clear  that
the market-related developmental processes do not generally  benefit  women.
The labour of women is a crucial resource for rapid industrialisation.
Companies that seek to  produce  goods  for  export  commodities  are  still
ruthlessly exploiting the labour resources of  women  as  cheap  labour.  To
this day women continue to be relegated to the  lower  ranks  of  production
and service, which brings the said companies  goods  for  excellent  returns
from export. It is our hope that women will become more  assertive  and  use
their  own  marketable  and  manufacturing  skills   to   become   exporters
themselves, so that an equitable flow of money is realised in that domain.

We need to take pride in the manner in which this  Bill  is  addressing  the
ever-important issue of empowering women. It is our hope that  through  this
Bill  women  will  be  capacitated  optimally,  so  that  they  can   become
investigators and inspectors, and take up their rightful  place  by  serving
the  International  Trade  Administration  Commission,  and   work   towards
fundamental change in enhancing our developmental agenda.

Effective trade and tariff policy and reform will promote  and  improve  our
competitive skills, both nationally and internationally.  It  is  imperative
that we  build  capacity  to  enable  and  empower  investigators,  vigilant
adjudicators and an efficient policing system  so  that  accountability  and
transparency enhance and promote our economic and  developmental  goals.  At
this point I am pleased to say  that  the  new  SACU  agreement  yet  to  be
presented to Parliament for ratification is consistent with our position  as
a democratic country seeking to build partnerships with  our  neighbours  in
the region and on the continent.

The ANC supports this Bill.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Mr Chairperson,  I  want  to  thank  all
colleagues who spoke on this Bill and explained the intricacies  thereof  in
some considerable detail.

If I may, I wish to comment on one or two points that were raised  in  order
to clarify them. As I indicated, we hope that the Southern  African  Customs
Union Agreement will be signed on Monday, 21 October 2002. It  would  be  an
historic achievement, and  because  of  its  historic  nature  it  has  been
proposed and agreed to that the heads of state will sign it. I think  it  is
far and away the most advanced form of economic integration on  the  African
continent and, frankly, as  a  structure,  probably  rates  with  any  other
structure in the world today for its participative dimensions.

The agreement will, of course, then come to this House  and  I  welcome  the
proposal, which I understand has been made, that we would have  hearings  on
it. I think it would allow for considerable understanding  of  the  benefits
of the Customs Union, but  also  for  an  understanding  of  the  inevitable
tensions between the smaller economies in that union and the larger  economy
of South Africa.

I would also like to briefly deal with  the  trade  policy  clarified  here.
This is new in our law. I welcome the amendment made by the committees,  but
I think the intention here is to try  to  create  a  much  more  transparent
means of relating  policy  to  administration.  This  will  also  allow  the
economic actors in the economy to be clearer on exactly what it  is  we  are
doing. So if one were making  an  application  for  tariff  protection,  one
would know that these would be the general criteria on which  it  was  going
to be assessed, and make those more transparent.

I think the issues raised by business regarding delays are not without  some
reality. We were also a  degree  concerned  about  that,  but  I  think  the
tremendous changes in the whole trade policy environment,  moving  it  to  a
policy-based environment, as opposed to  an  ad  hoc  lobbying  environment,
have meant that the number of applications that come forward now are  fewer.
I do not believe that this is going to be a major issue,  but,  as  the  hon
Ben Turok indicated, there is a balance between participation  and  possible
delays, but I think we have struck that balance well.

Further I would just like to say that I do not think that  we  should  stoop
to abusing this House and using the modicum of protection it  gives  to  try
to slander other human beings. It does not seem to me to be a wise move  and
certainly does not add any credit to the party that the  spokesperson  spoke
for.

I would like to point out to the  hon  Bekker  that  they,  as  a  portfolio
committee, wisely suggested that we should distinguish  between  Cita,  Sita
and Seta. This resulted in Cita being called Itac, the  International  Trade
and Administration Commission, and I thank him. However,  he  was  a  little
like me, one step behind in calling it the Cita.

I would like to say to the hon Rhoda that it is a  pleasure  to  hear  facts
put out by another party. I do think that  it  is  very  exciting.  When  we
indicated to the International Investment  Council  over  the  weekend  that
South Africa's number one export in 2001 was motorcars,  it  really  sent  a
very different message about what sort of economy we are. Moving from  being
exporters of gold and diamonds, which is  still  very  strong,  to  actually
saying that our number one export is motorcars,  and  that  the  number  two
export is components of motorcars, talks about a very different  economy.  I
think this is what is happening in our economy and it is very positive.

I indicated to people that if one watches the  top  twenty  exports  between
South Africa and Germany, they would, word for word, virtually be the  same.
So what has happened in a very short period  of  time  is  a  movement  from
being a primary product exporter to an industrial economy,  where  we  trade
with Germany exactly what they trade  with  us.  The  relationship  that  is
emerging is something closer to that within the European Union countries.

I think the above is immensely positive for this economy and that is why  we
are now beginning to see the first signs  of  our  determination  to  change
this economy in rising employment levels in many sectors. This  is  what  we
fought for and this is what I believe we  will  continue  to  fight  for.  I
thank all parties  for  supporting  the  Bill.  I  believe  that  it  is  an
improvement and a great step forward  in  the  unification  of  the  African
economies. [Applause.]

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on the Promotion  of  Equality  and  Prevention  of  Unfair
     Discrimination Amendment Bill [B 41 - 2002] (National  Assembly  -  sec
     75), dated 25 September 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the subject of  the  Promotion  of  Equality  and
         Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Amendment Bill [B  41  -  2002]
         (National Assembly - sec 75), referred to it and classified by  the
         Joint Tagging Mechanism as a section  75  Bill,  reports  the  Bill
         with amendments [B 41A - 2002], and endorses the classification  of
         the Bill as a section 75 Bill.


         The Committee wishes to report further, as follows:


         1. The Equality Review Committee, established in terms  of  section
              32 of the Promotion  of  Equality  and  Prevention  of  Unfair
              Discrimination Act, 2000 (Act No.  4  of  2000),  must,  among
              others,  submit  regular  reports  to  the  Minister  on   the
              operation  of  the  Act,  including  recommendations  on   any
              necessary amendments to the Act to improve its operation.  The
              establishment of the Equality Review Committee was a conscious
              decision  of  the  Legislature,  which  was  informed  by  the
              deliberations of the Ad Hoc Joint Committee  on  Promotion  of
              Equality and Prevention of  Unfair  Discrimination  Bill.  The
              question has, however, been raised in various  quarters  about
              the continued existence and feasibility of the Equality Review
              Committee due to  the  financial  implications  involved,  and
              since Parliament already fulfils an  oversight  function.  The
              Department is requested to  investigate  and  report  back  to
              Parliament, by the end of February 2003,  on  the  feasibility
              and viability of the Equality  Review  Committee,  bearing  in
              mind the financial and other scarce resources it uses, and  to
              address the matter appropriately, including  the  introduction
              of legislation, if necessary. Relevant  parties,  specifically
              the South African Human Rights Commission, must  be  consulted
              in this regard.


         2. It has come to the Committee's attention that there  is  concern
              that the usual exclusively dichotomous understanding given  to
              the words "sex" and "gender" could carry over into the law and
              that it could be  argued  that  "intersexual"  individuals  or
              those  "intersexual"  individuals  whose  gender   roles   are
              changed, potentially remain unprotected. The Committee  is  of
              the view that the equality  clause  in  the  Constitution  was
              never intended to exclude any vulnerable groups, and  that  it
              may be necessary to include "intersexuality" by stipulation in
              the  Promotion  of   Equality   and   Prevention   of   Unfair
              Discrimination Act, 2000, thereby ensuring that the definition
              of "sex" in law explicitly includes "intersexuality".


              The Department is requested to investigate  this  concern  and
              address  it  in   an   appropriate   manner,   including   the
              introduction of appropriate  legislation,  if  necessary.  The
              Department is requested, during its investigation, to  consult
              broadly, including the South African Law  Commission,  and  to
              report back to Parliament by the end of February 2003.


     Report to be considered.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Twenty-Fifth Report of the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,
     dated 18 September 2002:


         The Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  having  considered  the
         Report of the Auditor-General on the financial  statements  of  the
         Guardians' Fund (the Fund) for the year ended  31  March  2001  [RP
         165-01],  and  having  considered  responses  to  the   Committee's
         queries  by  the  Director-General:  Justice   and   Constitutional
         Development and  the  Managing  Director:  Masters  Business  Unit,
         reports as follows:


         1. Audit opinion


              The  Committee  noted  with  concern   the   Auditor-General's
              disclaimer of opinion on the financial audit and the qualified
              opinion on the compliance audit.


              The Committee recommends that serious attention be paid to all
              aspects which led to the disclaimer and the qualified opinion,
              with a view to avoiding such  negative  audit  opinions  being
              expressed by the Auditor-General in future.


         2. Ineffective accounting systems


              The Committee noted  with  concern  that  the  Auditor-General
              again reported on the ineffective manual accounting system  of
              the Fund.


              The Committee welcomes the urgent steps being taken to  ensure
              that the ineffective manual accounting system  is  phased  out
              and  that   the   target   date   for   completion   of   full
              computerisation of the Fund is December 2002.


              The Committee recommends that the Department submit  a  report
              to it by 15 January 2003, confirming the full  and  successful
              computerisation of the Fund.


         3. Trained and skilled staff


              The Committee is concerned about the fact  that  the  Fund  is
              experiencing a critical shortage of  skilled  and  experienced
              staff.


              The Committee noted that, despite the increased workload,  the
              staff complement could not be  increased  due  to  a  lack  of
              funds.


              The Committee noted that the Department is giving priority  to
              the appointment of trained and experienced accountants to head
              the various funds, as well as to filling the post of Financial
              Director for the Master's National Office.


              The Committee recommends that the above appointments  be  made
              urgently,  and  that  a  progress  report  on  the  matter  be
              submitted to it by 15 January 2003.


         4. Bank reconciliations


              The Committee is concerned that either no bank reconciliations
              or only limited reconciliations were performed  regarding  the
              current accounts of the various funds.


              The Committee notes the reasons for  the  failure  to  do  so,
              welcomes  the  steps  taken  to  update   the   reconciliation
              statements   of   the   various   funds,   and   notes    that
              reconciliations have  been  brought  up  to  date  at  several
              offices.


              The Committee recommends that a progress report  be  submitted
              to it by 15 January 2003 regarding those  offices  where  bank
              reconciliations have not yet been brought up to date.


         5. Disciplinary action


              The Committee noted that the Internal  Audit  section  of  the
              Department was requested to determine the functionality of the
              various offices, and that a request was made for conducting  a
              forensic audit.


              The Committee further noted that charges were  laid  with  the
              SAPS, that various criminal charges  are  being  investigated,
              and that disciplinary action  is  being  taken  against  those
              suspected of misconduct and negligence  in  the  execution  of
              their duties.


              The Committee recommends that the Department submits to it  by
              15 January 2003 a schedule of  the  various  criminal  charges
              being investigated, and  the  nature  of  disciplinary  action
              taken, if any, against those suspected  of  misconduct  and/or
              negligence.


         6. Compliance


              The Committee noted that, due to the manual accounting system,
              it is difficult to  comply  with  certain  provisions  of  the
              Administration of Estates Act and the Income Tax Act.


              The Committee further noted that the  computerisation  of  the
              Fund will in future significantly improve, to the extent  that
              it may even ensure compliance with the relevant provisions  of
              the above-mentioned Acts.


              The Committee recommends that  the  Department  include  these
              compliance aspects in  its  formal  report  to  the  Committee
              regarding the  full  and  successful  computerisation  of  the
              Guardians' Fund.


         7. Hearing


              Having examined the Report of the Auditor-General  and  having
              heard the various inputs, the  Committee  recommends  that  no
              hearing be held on the Guardians'  Fund  for  the  year  under
              review.


     Report to be considered.

1.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on the Judicial  Matters  Amendment  Bill  [B  55  -  2002]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 25 September 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the subject of  the  Judicial  Matters  Amendment
         Bill [B 55 - 2002] (National Assembly - sec  75),  referred  to  it
         and classified by the Joint Tagging Mechanism as a section 75  Bill
         -


         1. endorses the classification of the Bill as a  section  75  Bill;

              [B 60 - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 75).


         The Committee wishes to report further, as follows:


         1. The Committee,  having  taken  into  account  the  limited  time
              remaining to deal with draft legislation for the remainder  of
              the 2002 session of Parliament, was of  the  opinion  that  it
              should deal with only one provision of  the  Judicial  Matters
              Amendment Bill, namely that which entails an amendment to  the
              Promotion of Access to Information Act, 2000  (Act  No.  2  of
              2000), since the issues involved in  that  amendment  are  the
              same as some of  the  issues  involved  in  the  Promotion  of
              Equality and Prevention  of  Unfair  Discrimination  Amendment
              Bill [B 41 - 2002] and the Promotion of Administrative Justice
              Amendment Bill [B 46 - 2002], which are being finalised by the
              Committee on an urgent basis. All the said Bills deal with the
              designation  of  presiding  officers  for  purposes  of  court
              proceedings arising from the application of the  Promotion  of
              Access  to   Information   Act,   2000,   the   Promotion   of
              Administrative  Justice  Act,  2000,  and  the  Promotion   of
              Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000.


         2. The Committee intends finalising the  issues  remaining  in  the
              Judicial Matters Amendment  Bill  at  a  later  stage,  either
              during the last quarter of the 2002 session of Parliament  or,
              if needs be, during the 2003 session of Parliament,  when  the
              issues and principles contained therein can be debated without
              any time constraints.

Report to be considered.
