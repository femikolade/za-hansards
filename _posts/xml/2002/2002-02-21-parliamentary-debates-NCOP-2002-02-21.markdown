                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates Mbhazima Shilowa, the Premier of Gauteng, on  the  bold
       stand that he and his  government  have  taken  on  the  question  of
       nevirapine intervention in order to save and  extend  lives  in  that
       province, in spite of  attempts  by  Minister  Tshabalala-Msimang  to
       denigrate and halt the premier's efforts;


  (2) salutes Mr Shilowa's courage and calls on other  provinces  that  are
       not yet providing nevirapine support for Aids sufferers to follow his
       courageous example.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Is  there  any
objection to the  motion?  [Interjections.]  Order!  In  the  light  of  the
objection, the motion may not be proceeded with. The motion  without  notice
will therefore become notice of a motion.

       OPENING OF HI-TECH TELEMEDICINE TRAINING CENTRE IN BLOEMFONTEIN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat die Minister van Gesondheid op 18 Februarie  2002  'n
       nuwe hoë-tegnologie satellietopleidingsentrum in Bloemfontein  geopen

  (2) verder kennis neem dat die nuwe  bestuursentrum  die  eerste  van  sy
       soort in Suid-Afrika is en dus net  die  begin  van  telemedisyne  in
       Suider-Afrika is wat in staat sal wees om verpleegstudente,  algemene
       praktisyns en gemeenskapsdokters wat selfs in die mees  afgeleë  dele
       van die land woon en werk die kans te gee om opleiding te ontvang  en
       met spesialiste te kommunikeer;


  (3) verneem dat die stelsel oor die wêreld heen met groot sukses  gebruik
       word;


  (4) die Departement van Gesondheid in die Vrystaat gelukwens met  hierdie
       tegnologiese ontwikkeling; en


  (5) die Minister van Gesondheid versoek om die ander  provinsies  aan  te
       moedig om spoedig in hul voetspore te volg - indien  dit  nie  gebeur
       nie, sal die genoemde stelsel nie ten volle landwyd in werking gestel
       kan word nie.
(Translation of motion without notice follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL:  Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  on 18 February 2002 the Minister of Health opened a new  hi-tech
           satellite training centre in Bloemfontein which was erected at a
           cost of R11 million;


       (b)  the new management centre is the first of its kind  in  the  RSA
           and therefore only the beginning  of  telemedicine  in  Southern
           Africa,   which   will   provide   nursing   students,   general
           practitioners and community doctors who are living  and  working
           in even the remotest parts the opportunity to  receive  training
           and communicate with specialists; and


       (c)  this system is being used with great success all over the world;


  (2) congratulates the Free State health department on this  technological
       development; and


  (3) requests the Minister of Health to encourage the other provinces soon
       to follow in their footsteps, because if this  does  not  happen  the
       system in question cannot become fully operative countrywide.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Order!  I  take  this  opportunity  to
welcome the hon Deputy Minister and call upon him address the House.

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND   AFFAIRS:   Thank   you,
Chairperson, for the opportunity to  meet  this  high  body  in  this  Other
Place, the lower House. I hope this will only be  of  short  duration  until
hon members move into their new place. [Interjections.] No, I mean it well.

With respect, I think this is a very important piece of legislation;  it  is
not a long Bill. This Bill has very important implications  for  the  cattle
trade and other animals, especially in South Africa. It  is  the  result  of
quite  an  extensive  consultation  process,  which  was  conducted  by  the
department by inviting comments from the  public  and  by  holding  national
workshop was also held.

The needs that were identified in this regard were,  amongst  other  things,
the following. Firstly, the feeling of the  sector  involved  was  that  one
needs a countrywide compulsory marking system. That is  the  only  way  that
one can really have this in operation. As recently as 10 years ago,  it  was
only in the Pietersburg district where marking was compulsory,  although  it
has always been a widespread practice.

The second need  that  was  expressed  was  that  one  needed  some  country
identification mark for the purposes of export  and  of  controlling  border
situations. Another need that came out of these consultations was  that  one
had to make some provision for people to make a living out of  branding  and
the registration process, and that must be regulated somehow.

Another request, which had to be  heeded,  was  the  need  for  a  tattooing
acknowledgement of calves, lambs and  goat  kids  before  they  reached  the
weaning  age,  especially  for  skin  trade  purposes  and  that  the   same
consideration be given to the expressed need for  tattooing  feedlot  cattle
or cattle under the age of 18 months, in the sense that one does not  damage
the skin if it is going to be used for leather purposes.
Another need that was expressed was to  have  the  legislation  in  a  user-
friendly, farmer-friendly and cattle farmer-friendly way and that  it  reads
easily, which was not  the  case  with  the  old  Act,  and  that  it  makes
provision for all alternate marketing methods.

Regarding all the needs that I have mentioned, we get results  in  this  new
Bill which really satisfy these needs in a substantive way. This led to  the
result that a number of changes were  needed  in  the  legislation.  It  was
therefore easier to draft an entirely new Bill.

Hon members can compare this Bill before them today, from the point of  view
of legislative drafting, to a Bill we will deal with a little  while  later,
the veterinary professions Bill, in which there  are  extensive  amendments.
If one looks at this Bill one will see what a mess it becomes if one  starts
making amendments extensively.

Here one has an elegant Bill, if I may say so, which I hope will  streamline
the legislation and which will be put into operation very  easily,  although
it will still remain quite an extensive process.  However,  we  now  have  a
Bill which will result in a more specific Act, and  the  technique  is  very
easy. It is a classic technique which always works well: One gives the  main
principles in  the  Bill,  or  in  the  Act,  and  eventually,  and  in  the
regulations, one makes provision for the things that  change  from  time  to
time.

For example, when this Bill came before me for the first  time,  my  request
was that it must make it possible, without coming to Parliament  again,  for
a complete tracing system  to  be  put  in  place.  It  is  now  like  that,
although, for other practical reasons, it would not be possible to  have,  a
tracing system in operation in South Africa within a  few  months.  However,
by amending the regulations, we can do  the  administrative  work  far  more
efficiently.

The extensive consultation process, I think,  has  led  to  a  situation  in
which the only people who will object to this  Bill  are  stock  thieves.  I
hope no one here will object to it today, because then we will know  why  he
or she objects. [Laughter.] I hope hon members get the message that we  want
this Bill adopted in their  honourable  House.  [Interjections.]  I  am  not
making any reference to anyone specific, Chairperson.

We will have a visible deterrent when this branding system is in place  that
is applicable to all cattle in the country. This will have a big  effect  on
stock theft in this  country.  We  will  have  positive  identification  and
positive proof of ownership; policing of stock theft  will  be  far  easier,
the recovery rate of cattle will be more effective,  and  we  will  have  an
easier system of recording for purposes of identification. This will  enable
a tracing system eventually as soon as we have that capacity in place.

The key components of the Animal Identification  Bill  include,  of  course,
the name change. From ``branding'' we move to  ``identification''.  We  have
better definitions. In  fact,  hon  members  in  the  select  committee  did
excellent work. I went through their minutes. They  made  a  very  important
amendment, which, I believe, is also before the House  today  in  the  sense
that -`` wat noem jy die knip van ore?'' - marking  or  ``oorknip"  is  also
excluded as a legal identification mark. This  amendment  does  not  exclude
the use of that method for traditional purposes.

I want to say something about the situation in traditional  areas  as  well.
There are options for the tattooing of cattle in the  legislation  now,  and
it is possible to put down minimum ages for hot-iron  marking,  which  is  a
welfare consideration. A hot iron marks small, young cattle.

There is a 14-day period of  grace,  which  was  not  provided  for  in  the
previous Act, for buying and selling  of  cattle  and  other  animals.  This
makes it possible for people who keep animals they have bought for  a  short
period to sell them again.

There is also  provision  for  other  identification  methods  for  specific
groups. Perhaps the most important provision, in the SADC context,  is  that
the Bill provides for the use of national marks. In that way one  identifies
the country of origin. Especially border farmers would be glad to  make  use
of this. All exports should have these marks. I could just say that  Namibia
is already marking exports to South Africa with an ``N'' as their  country's
identification.

I think the system is going to work well. A lot of work still  needs  to  be
done to implement the system, but  the  beauty  of  the  Bill  is  that  the
existing national department's animal  identification  system  can  then  be
used effectively as a tracing tool. The new legislation  will  enhance  this
further. Traceability is where the meat trade is heading. People who  buy  a
piece of meat in a shop, a supermarket or a butchery want to know where  the
meat comes from, from which farm and sometimes they want to know  what  type
of animal the meat is from. The legislation will enhance this  and  will  be
supported by the work  being  done  by  SA  Studbook  activities  under  the
Intergis system, and can be used by producers.

I just want  to  mention  one  thing  which  I  think  is  a  very  positive
development. The portfolio committee of this House  received  comments  from
the  national  House  of  Traditional  Leaders,  in  which  they   expressed
appreciation for the legislation and also made some suggestions  which  were
responded  to.  I  think  it  is  a  very  positive  development  that  that
interaction has taken place. I will tell hon members why I say this. Thirty-
five percent of the cattle stock in this country  is  to  be  found  in  the
areas under  traditional  leadership.  This  represents  a  huge  number  of
cattle. Secondly, there is a tradition about cattle, goat and sheep  farming
in those areas that is a national asset and  should  be  developed  further.
That is the point I wish to make.

The national House of Traditional Leaders was  actually  worried  about  one
thing. They argued that in the communal  area  some  people  have  only  two
heads of cattle, and only a few people have 100 or 200 head of cattle.  They
therefore wanted a communal mark.  They  were  worried  that  there  was  no
provision for this in the Bill. Now they  have  been  shown  that  there  is
ample provision for that, and this will be developed further in the  system.
I want to appeal to the department that this must be developed in close  co-
operation with the traditional leaders.

There is another thing which I could perhaps mention here, by the  way,  and
that is animal welfare. We are very worried about  good  husbandry  in  this
country. There is traditional knowledge available in the traditional  areas,
of how one works with cattle, and with animals generally. That knowledge  is
being lost with the extensive urbanisation that  is  taking  place  in  this
country. Somehow we must get some of that back. We can only do this  through
the traditional leaders, who have influence in those areas, and who are  the
guardians of these traditions, of how one works  with  cattle,  and  of  the
love for the animals that one works with. Perhaps we must send  people  from
the urban areas and the townships to do service in  the  traditional  areas,
so that they can herd cattle or do something like that, to keep and  develop
this culture. I do not know whether this is practical at all, but  it  would
be a wonderful thing.  [Interjections.]  A  kind  of  school,  yes.  Perhaps
people who know more about this can talk about it.

Agriculture is culture.  I  have  brought  something  with  me.  I  actually
obtained the permission of the Chairperson to show this.  Here  I  have  two
branding irons. [Interjections.] This was my grandfather's and this  was  my
father's, although I grew up in a small town in the Free  State.  Because  I
am a pen pusher, I am using my grandfather's  branding  iron  to  hold  down
papers on my desk. But it means something to me. It means  that  although  I
do not have cattle, somewhere in the past my forebears were  cattle  owners,
although not big cattle owners.

In fact, my grandfather fought with De  La  Rey  in  the  Western  Transvaal
during the Anglo-Boer War. He told me that for the last six  months  of  the
war he had no clothes left, and was fighting naked on his horse.  After  the
war, when he got back to the farm, he  had  no  cattle.  There  was  nothing
left. The house was burnt and  there  were  no  cattle  left.  He  had  this
branding iron made to reassure him that one day he would have cattle  again.
And he did have cattle again.

I was present when this branding iron of my father's was  made,  by  one  of
the last blacksmiths in the Free State in the  early  50s.  I  was  still  a
little boy then. I went with my father to the blacksmith so  that  he  could
make my father's own branding iron, or ``brandyster''. I  was  present  when
this was made, with hammer and fire, by that blacksmith, who was  quite  old
by that time. I think he must have been one of  the  last  ones.  It  is  my
culture, it is associated with cattle and we must preserve this.

We must have respect for the  cattle  culture  and  animal  culture  in  the
traditional areas. Otherwise we will not be able to  build  the  economy  in
the traditional areas. It must rest on the basis  of  animal  husbandry  and
cattle. That is the only way that we are going to build those economies.  We
must realise that that is an asset we have  here.  We  must  work  in  close
association with the traditional leaders. That is why  I  am  so  glad  that
this Council has made contact with the traditional leaders in  this  regard.
We will not be able to  make  any  progress  if  we  do  not  get  that  co-
operation.

I want to close with the observation that, although we lived in  a  town,  I
had to milk the cows. And one of the biggest fights between  my  father  and
mother was on a Saturday - I was then in Std 9 -  when  I  had  to  play  my
final piano examination, and still had to milk the cows in the  morning.  My
father told me to milk the cows and my mother said that it  might  hurt  the
little boy's hands. He could milk the cows if  he  was  going  to  play  the
piano at 11 o'clock. But my father stood firm and said that  I  should  milk
the cows and that it was very good for developing one's hands. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  Order!  I  noticed  that  hon  Kgoshi
Mokoena enjoyed your speech, Deputy Minister.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs,  hon  members,  as  far  as  the  Animal  Identification  Bill   is
concerned, I think the hon the Deputy Minister has said it all.

I would like  to  tell  hon  members  that  this  Bill  before  us  contains
proposals with a view to introducing a  more  effective  method  of  control
over people marking animals, so as to prove ownership of  livestock  and  to
facilitate the permanent and visible marking of animals as  a  deterrent  to
stock thieves, as the hon the Deputy Minister has already said.

The reasoning behind these proposals is to enable the SA Police Service  and
Stock Theft Unit to render an effective  service  to  all  stock  owners  in
South Africa. The Livestock Brands Act, Act No 87 of 1962,  provides  for  a
legal and uniform identification system for most farm animals. This Act  was
reviewed on a regular  basis  in  order  to  ensure  its  efficiency  as  an
identification system.

One of the first proposals was to amend the name  of  the  Livestock  Brands
Act. This amendment stems from  the  fact  that  ``brand''  refers  to  both
tattooing and branding. It was agreed that the general  perception  is  that
brand only refers to hot-iron and freeze-branding. The conclusion  was  that
the term ``identification'' is a more suitable one.

This Bill serves to  deal  with  practical  problems  experienced  with  the
current Act. It emphasises the importance of identifying animals which  have
permanent and visible marks on animals as  these  act  as  a  deterrent,  as
stock thieves are  more  inclined  to  steal  unmarked  animals.  A  uniform
identification system makes positive identification  of  stolen  or  strayed
animals  possible.  It  also  makes  proof  of   ownership   possible.   The
identification  of  animals  significantly  contributes  to  more  effective
policing, which results in an improved recovery  rate  of  lost  and  stolen
animals and an increase in the  number  of  stock  thieves  apprehended  and
convicted.

There is an old expression that one  person's  freedom  ends  where  another
person's begins. This Bill brings the freedom to  the  communities  who  are
victims of theft, and on the other hand limits the long fingers of  thieves.


This Bill also addresses the most critical problems in identification so  as
to be in line with international standards. It does this  by  providing  for
the coming-of-age movement, that is tattooing  cattle  under  the  age  that
they  have  two  teeth,  and  feedlots  have  a  problem  with  the  current
legislation since branding of  weaners  reduces  the  value  of  the  hides.
Therefore, this Bill provides for alternative forms  of  identification  for
different types of animals.

The Bill also  provides  for  a  register  of  people  marking  animals  and
determines that these people should be trained so as  to  introduce  a  more
effective method of control over them. There  is  an  indigenous  method  of
marking  animals.  I  want  to  relate  an  instance  that  happened  in  my
constituency, which is between Brits and  Rustenburg,  where  stock  thieves
managed to get into the bush and steal a good number of cattle and it  seems
as if  these  thieves  managed  to  transport  these  cattle  by  rail  from
Rustenburg station to the Transkei.

I felt pity for the people who were after these cattle but they  managed  to
trace the cattle to the Transkei. And because these cattle were  marked  the
indigenous way, probably those people who  were  moving  those  cattle  from
Rustenburg probably did not look for those  marks.  As  a  result  of  these
indigenous marks, they managed to get some of these  cattle  back  from  the
Transkei.

Therefore this Bill is imperative. It  is  extremely  important,  but  I  am
happy that it does not  eliminate  the  indigenous  marking  of  cattle.  We
support this Bill. This Bill is long overdue and this Council should  accept
this Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr L Mushwana): Order! I  hope  you  are
not implying that people in the Transkei steal cattle. [Laughter.]

Dr  E  A  CONROY:  Agb  Voorsitter,  Adjunkminister  Du  Toit  en  kollegas,
veediefstal is so oud soos die berge en sal  altyd  met  ons  wees.  In  die
eerste vyf maande van 1999 is daar, in afgeronde syfers, 27  000  beeste  en
50 000 skape as gesteel aangemeld, waarvan onderskeidelik 13 000  beeste  en
14 000 skape  teruggevind  is.  Die  sukseskoers  van  inhegtenisnemings  en
skuldigbevindings van veediewe sou in alle waarskynlikheid veel hoër  gewees
het, as daar nie soveel diere  sonder  een  of  ander  vorm  van  permanente
identifikasie rondgeloop het nie.

Die permanente en sigbare merk van vee  het  verskeie  ooglopende  voordele,
naamlik  die  makliker  identifisering  vir  aantekeningsdoeleindes  op  die
gebied van stoetboerdery en die suiwelbedryf;  positiewe  identifikasie  van
gesteelde en wegloopvee,  en  dus  positiewe  bewys  van  eienaarskap,  word
verskaf  en  meer  doeltreffende   polisiëring   word   bevorder,   wat   as
afskrikmiddel vir veediewe moet dien. Dit is dus binne die vermoë  van  vee-
eienaars om die lewe van veediewe al hoe moeiliker te maak  deur  hul  diere
duidelik te merk.

Die Wet op Veebrandmerke, Wet 87 van 1962, maak voorsiening vir  'n  wettige
en eenvormige stelsel vir die identifisering van  meeste  plaasdiere  en  is
die enigste wettige wyse waarop vee-eienaars hul eienaarskap kan bewys.  Die
wetsontwerp wat egter vandag ter tafel is, het ten  doel  om  die  bestaande
wet te herroep en in sy  plek  nuwe  veeboervriendelike  wetgewing  daar  te
stel. Hoewel die term ``brandmerk'' na  beide  tatoeëermerking  en  aanbring
van 'n brandmerk verwys, is die algemene persepsie dat  ``brandmerk''  slegs
na  die  merk   van   diere   met   'n   warm   brandyster   en   sogenaamde
vriesbrandmerking  verwys.  Dit  word  algemeen   aanvaar   dat   die   term
``identifiseringsmerk'' meer aanvaarbaar  en  duideliker  omskrywend  is  en
sodoende verwarring sal uitskakel.

Die wetsontwerp maak onder andere verder voorsiening vir die verpligte  merk
van alle diere en groepe diere wat deur die Minister  van  Landbou  verklaar
word vir aansoeke om registrasie van identifiseringsmerke of die  uitreiking
van   registrasiesertifikate   en   die   oordrag   en   kansellering    van
identifiseringsmerke.  Dit  maak   verder   voorsiening   vir   die   groter
konfigurasie en spasiëring van drie  merke  wat  verskil  van  grootvee  tot
kleinvee en varke  tot  volstruise.  In  die  geval  van  grootvee  kan  die
identifikasie  'n  brandmerk  op  enige  duidelik  sigbare  area,  met   die
uitsondering van die nek, of 'n merk  binne  een  van  die  twee  ore  wees,
terwyl in die geval van kleinvee en varke 'n tatoeëermerk  slegs  binne  die
ore mag wees. Volstruise daarenteen se merke mag, in  die  geval  van  voëls
jonger as ses maande, slegs tatoeëermerke wees onder een van die vlerke,  en
vir ouer voëls,  brandmerke  op  een  van  die  dye  wees.  (Translation  of

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, Deputy Minister Du Toit and  colleagues,  stock
theft is as old as the mountains and will always  be  with  us.  During  the
first five months of 1999, in round numbers, 27 000 head of  cattle  and  50
000 sheep were reported as stolen, of which 13 000 cattle and 14  000  sheep
were recovered respectively. The success rate of arrests and convictions  of
stock thieves would in all probability have been higher, if there  were  not
so many animals roaming around without  some  or  other  form  of  permanent
identification.

The permanent and visible mark of cattle has  various  apparent  advantages,
namely the easier identification for record purposes in the domain of  state
farming and the dairy industry, and the positive  identification  of  stolen
animals  and  animals  who  go  astray,  and  therefore  positive  proof  of
ownership and more effective policing which should serve as a deterrent  for
stock thieves. It is therefore within the ability of cattle owners  to  make
the lives of stock thieves more difficult by clearly marking their  animals.


The Livestock Brands Act, Act No 87 of 1962, makes  provision  for  a  legal
and uniform system for the identification of most farm animals  and  is  the
only legal  manner  in  which  cattle  owners  can  prove  their  ownership.
However, the Bill tabled today aims to repeal the existing Act  and  to  put
in  place  new,  cattle-farmer  friendly  legislation.  Although  the   term
``brand'' refers both to tattoo marks and branding, the  general  perception
is that ``brand'' only refers to the mark of animals who have  been  branded
with a hot branding iron and  so-called  freeze-branding.  It  is  generally
accepted that the term identification  mark  is  more  acceptable  and  more
clearly defined and therefore eliminate confusion.

The Bill, inter alia, makes further provision for the compulsory marking  of
all animals and groups of animals which have been declared, by the  Minister
of Agriculture, for applications for registration  of  identification  marks
or the distribution  of  registration  certificates  and  the  transfer  and
cancellation of identification marks. It makes  further  provision  for  the
greater configuration and spacing of three marks which  differ  from  cattle
to sheep and pigs to ostriches. In the case  of  cattle  the  identification
mark can be a brand on any clearly visible area, with the exception  of  the
neck or a mark inside one of the two ears, while in the case  of  sheep  and
pigs only a tattoo inside the ears are acceptable. On  the  other  hand,  in
the case of ostriches, where the birds are  younger  than  six  months,  the
tattoo should only be under one of the wings and older  birds  can  only  be
branded on one of their thighs.]

This  Bill  also  makes  possible  the  development  of   a   new   central,
computerised system, which will not only accommodate  historical  brands  as
far as possible, but also make it possible for space-age  technology  to  be
applied. Imagine, a stock farmer will  now  be  able  to  use  a  laptop  or
notebook computer out in the grazing pastures to identify and  classify  his
or her animals. Once the use of  microchips  under  the  skins  of  animals,
which will also be allowed in terms of this  Bill,  becomes  cost-effective,
stock farmers will be able to  track  their  stolen  or  strayed  animal  by
satellite.

I just sincerely hope  that  this  Bill  will  not  enable  the  tracing  or
tracking of MPs in the parliamentary complex!

The following question will naturally be asked: But what  about  traditional
marks? Both the Bill and regulations make provision for stockowners  in  the
traditional communal and other areas to continue  using  traditional  marks,
like marks on horns and hooves, paint marks on the body as  well  as  clips,
clasps, tags or rivets in the ears to identify  their  cattle.  These  marks
can be retained, provided the animals also  have  the  legal  identification
marks as prescribed in the Bill and the regulations.

The New NP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Voorsitter, ek wil net graag  aan  die  Adjunkminister  sê
dat die DP hierdie wetgewing al in die komiteestadium  gesteun  het  en  dat
ons dit nie vandag steun omdat hy verwys het na ``only  stock  thieves  will
not support this Bill'' nie. [Chairperson, I would just  like  to  tell  the
Deputy Minister that the  DP  already  supported  this  legislation  at  the
committee stage and that we are not supporting it today because he  said  to
``only stock thieves will not support this Bill''.]

The following two issues of concern,  although  they  were  reasonably  well
addressed and answered, were raised by the DP. Firstly, there is  the  issue
of cross-border and cross-provincial movement,  and  the  liaison  with  law
enforcement authorities and their counterparts.  This  Bill  would  be  very
difficult to manage if the relationship  between  law  enforcement  agencies
and their counterparts is not  strengthened.  The  other  issue  -  and  the
Minister referred to it himself - is about whether the  department  has  the
capacity to maintain and update the register.

Dit is geweldig belangrik, al is daar die twee weke speling voordat  hierdie
merk verander word, dat ons kapasiteit reg is alvorens  ons  regtigwaar  tot
aksie oorgaan. Ook voel ek dat die provinsies  en  die  SADC-lande  'n  baie
belangrike rol het om hier te speel. [Although there is the grace period  of
two weeks before this mark must be changed, it is extremely  important  that
our capacity is correct before we really proceed  to  action.  I  also  feel
that the provinces and the SADC countries have  a  very  important  role  to
play here.]

There should also be access by the provinces as well as the law  enforcement
officers to this register and it should be updated and maintained daily.

In ons komitee het  ons  ook  die  kwellinge  van  die  tradisionele  leiers
bespreek en, soos die Minister gesê het, 'n groot gedeelte  van  die  kuddes
wat vandag in ons land is, behoort aan hierdie  mense.  Ek  dink  egter  nie
daar is rede vir hulle om bekommerd te wees dat dit te  duur  of  onprakties
gaan wees om hul diere te merk  nie.  Ek  glo  dat  hulle  bekommernis  goed
aangespreek is.

Ek is ook bly dat die Minister bekommerd is oor die welstand van  diere,  en
ek hoop dit sluit ook troeteldiere  in.  Dit  val  sekerlik  ook  onder  die
Minister se departement. Ek hoop dat ons eersdaags  wetgewing  gaan  hê  wat
die eienaars van troeteldiere ook sal verplig om hul diere deur  middel  van
'n sogenaamde ``chip'' te merk. Sodoende sal  ons  dan  ook  die  mense  wat
hulle troeteldiere verwaarloos, veral oor vakansietye, aan die pen kan  laat
ry  en  daardeur  ons  dierebeskermingsverenigings  baie  onkoste  en   werk
bespaar. Hierdie verenigings val ook onder die Minister  se  departement  en
ek hoop ons kan vanjaar 'n verandering sien in die  begroting  en  dat  daar
geld beskikbaar sal wees vir hierdie  verenigings.  [Applous.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In our committee we also discussed the concerns of the traditional  leaders
and, as the Minister said, a large proportion of the cattle in  our  country
today belongs to these people. However, I do not think there is  reason  for
them to be concerned that it is going to be too expensive or impractical  to
mark their animals. I believe that their concerns have been well addressed.

I am also glad that the Minister is concerned about the welfare of  animals,
and I hope that this includes pets as well. This certainly also falls  under
the Minister's department. I hope that we will soon have  legislation  which
will also compel the owners of pets to mark their animals by way  of  a  so-
called chip. In this way we will then also  be  able  to  catch  people  who
neglect their pets, particularly during holiday  periods  and  in  so  doing
save our societies for the protection of animals a lot of  money  and  work.
These societies also fall under the Minister's department and  I  hope  that
this year we can see a change in the budget and  that  money  will  be  made
available to these societies. [Applause.]]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, there is not a lot left that one can say. We  in
the ACDP support this Bill. It will contribute to better stock  control  and
will assist in determining ownership. It will help  the  police  authorities
in dealing with stock theft. I would say, however, that what is proposed  is
somewhat old-fashioned, because the technology already exists and we  should
rapidly be moving in that direction.

When walking with one's cattle and one impregnates a microchip  in  the  ear
or somewhere else, one just hooks up one's computer, presses  a  button  and
one knows the birth date, weight, parents and  everything  else.  It  is  so
simple. It is not difficult  to  do,  and  the  state  veterinarian  already
called on all farmers in South Africa to do this.

I  do  not  know  when  last  the  Minister  went  around  with  the   state
veterinarian, because if he does, he will see in their  vehicles  that  they
can press a button that gives one the exact latitude and longitude of  one's
farm. They already carry quite sophisticated apparatus. They  already  visit
every herd every year for brucellosis and TB. It would not  be  a  difficult
thing for them either to impregnate on a free basis or  to  check.  That  is
something that we should look at.

My colleague hon Moatshe raised the matter of the  difficulty  that  if  one
delivers heavily branded cattle to the market, then the price one  gets  for
the skins is much less. The Minister will know that our skins  are  used  by
Mercedes Benz and BMW at the moment, and massive value is  added,  as  those
skins are worked and then used for motor car seats.  That  is  a  very  good
beneficiation process, which starts with the cattle and in  particular  with
the branding. If one brands the skins badly, too  high  or  too  deep,  then
they do not want the skins. That is a problem and many  farmers  just  brand
lightly before cattle go to market.

However, that does not answer the Minister's problems, which  are  addressed
in this Bill. If one brands a skin, the hair grows over it  and  two,  three
months later one can no longer see the branding. A microchip  would  address
all of that.

But this is a very good Bill. It does constitute  progress.  There  is  just
one point that I would like to make to the Minister and that concerns  game.
I do not know if he is going to extend this registration  process  to  game.
If one buys a pair of roan antelope, it will cost one a  couple  of  hundred
thousand rand. Suppose they jump across the fence, do  they  now  belong  to
one's neighbour because they are wild animals? The  identification  of  wild
animals, as game farming becomes a much more sophisticated industry  in  our
country, becomes important. Many parts of  our  country  can  be  integrated
into conservation for better utilisation of  our  resources,  and  it  might
well be that  the  Minister  might  consider  looking  at  how  this  animal
identification can also help the game farmer at some time in the future.

We support the Bill. It is a good measure.

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, the introduction of this Bill aims at  ensuring
that the constitutional obligation entrusted to the police is  observed.  In
terms  of  section  205(3)  of  the  Constitution,  Act  108  of  1996,  the
objectives of the Police  Service  are,  among  other  things,  to  prevent,
combat and  investigate  crime,  and  to  protect  the  inhabitants  of  the
Republic and their  property.  The  passage  of  this  Bill  will  therefore
facilitate the realisation of these objectives. There is  no  doubt  that  a
piece of legislation such as the  Animal  Identification  Bill  is  crucial,
taking into account the scourge of the high crime rate in our country.

The uniform identification system of control  over  people  marking  animals
underpins the basis of the intention of this legislation. The  process  will
ultimately realise  data  centralisation,  which  will  in  turn  facilitate
planning in the event of the outbreak of livestock diseases, such  as  foot-
and-mouth, brucellosis and redwater.

The Livestock Brands Act, Act 87  of  1962,  did  not  provide  a  centrally
controlled register system. In terms of the provision of  the  current  Act,
the  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs   can   readily   access
information with regard to the livestock population  throughout  the  entire
country.

The  implementation  of   this   Bill   cannot   be   without   constraints.
Affordability of the prescribed fee for the registration  of  identification
marks therefore becomes a crucial  matter.  Rural  livestock  owners  cannot
even afford one litre of dipping stuff for their cattle, let  alone  subject
their cattle to the annual innoculation  programme.  Prescribed  application
forms must be simplified, and,  if  possible,  the  local  African  language
should be used.

The viewpoints of the  national  House  of  Traditional  Leaders,  with  due
respect to the hon chief sitting next to me here,  have  been  noted.  Their
proposals   advocate   the   decentralisation   of   the   registration   of
identification marks, which might  culminate  in  an  uneven  identification
system, and thus render the process unable  to  achieve  the  intentions  of
this legislation. The possibility of  making  room  for  the  abuse  of  the
system cannot be ruled out.

In terms of section 3 of this Bill  -  I  think  the  Minister  has  already
touched on this portion - the registrar may in writing,  with  the  approval
of the Minister, authorise any person who is not an  officer  to  carry  out
the function entrusted to them.  Therefore,  the  contents  of  this  clause
leave room for taking  on  board  the  interest  or  plight  of  traditional
leaders.

In conclusion, I just want to draw the attention  of  this  Council  to  the
fact that it seems as if there are two areas of thought here,  in  terms  of
cattle rearing. We have the approach that attaches Western values  and  that
which attaches African values. Briefly, what I mean by this is that when  we
rear cattle, in terms of the Western values, we think of economic  activity,
of selling. But, if we think in terms of the African values,  I  think  that
the economic aspect is secondary, if not last. What  is  more  important  in
our African  culture  is  that  we  rear  cattle  for  the  sake  of  ritual
ceremonial activities - for use during functions, marriages, etc.  So,  this
is one issue to bear in mind when we  talk  of  cattle  rearing,  because  I
heard some of my colleagues, especially white  colleagues,  emphasising  and
inclining more to the Western or economic approach to the whole phenomenon.

With these few words,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairperson  and  the
Minister.

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, Deputy Minister and  colleagues,  it  is  really
pleasing to hear similar points from other political parties and  provinces.
This emphasises similarity of thought,  vision  and  actions,  and  that  is
consensus. So, let us be thankful that there is no polarity about it.

South Africa has hundreds of thousands  of  livestock.  With  such  a  large
amount of livestock, we  need  to  be  able  to  identify  the  animals  for
effective management, food safety, disease control and prevention  of  fraud
and stock theft. The problem  is  that,  until  now,  animal  identification
practices in South Africa have not been very effective.

This is because the Livestock Brands Act, in terms of which animals  had  to
be identified, contained some critical shortcomings such as confusion as  to
the meaning of brand, the marking of pre-weaners, lack of control  over  the
registration of marking operators and  the  difficulty  of  identifying  the
country of origin in cases of cross-border animals.

In terms of the markings of pre-weaners, the current Act only  provides  for
the branding of cattle, which causes a major problem  for  feedlots  because
the branding of weaners reduces the value of the animal hides.

Another shortcoming of the current Act is its inability  to  assist  in  the
prevention of cross-border stock theft. The new Animal  Identification  Bill
seeks to address these critical shortcomings by providing for  a  legal  and
uniform identification system for most farm animals.

A number of advantages will be derived from an improved  uniform  system  of
animal identification. Among others, it will  make  positive  identification
of stolen or stray animals possible; make proof of  ownership  much  easier;
contribute to more effective policing, which results in an improved rate  of
recovery of lost or stolen animals; and it will also lead to an increase  in
the number of stock thieves being apprehended and convicted.

Another significant improvement which is brought about by this new  Bill  is
the  possibility  of  using  alternative  identification   marks   such   as
microchips, transponders and DNA testing. These  new  techniques  of  animal
identification are already used worldwide, and by allowing its use in  South
Africa, we are beginning to conform  with  standards  which  are  recognised
worldwide.

The Bill also seeks to regulate the activities of people  who  mark  animals
other  than  their  own  for  financial  gain,   the   so-called   ``marking
operators''. Marking operators will have to comply with  certain  prescribed
requirements and will have to be  registered  by  the  Registrar  of  Animal
Identification before they will be issued  with  a  licence  to  operate  as
animal markers.

It will be of great help even to  the  Ministry  dealing  with  road  safety
because of the carnage caused in cases where stray animals have been  killed
on the roads and disowned because their owners fear persecution  and  having
to pay for damages for vehicles involved. However,  this  does  not  exclude
family tags, nipples, punctures and clippings. Much publicity and  education
needs to be executed for the Bill to be understood and supported.

This new Bill is a significant improvement on the existing  legislation.  It
will bring our animal identification system in line with international  best
practice. The ANC, therefore, supports this Bill in toto. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  some
very interesting comments were made.  I  do  thank  the  members  for  their
contributions.

There seems to be some misunderstanding, looking at  comments  made  by  the
DP,  about  administrative  capacity.  We  have   sufficient   capacity   to
administer the Bill as it stands at the moment. But the nature of this  Bill
is such that it can be used elastically in the way that the regulations  are
going to be enforced. As the ACDP has said, if we are talking about  getting
a microchip complete traceability system, as is the case in Britain  at  the
moment, that means every cattle owner must be able to  have  and  operate  a
computer. In Britain, every cattle farmer, normally the woman, because  they
are far more intelligent than the men, sits in front of a computer and  runs
the passport system the whole day, for traceability. That is a  problem.  Of
course, it is a bit old-fashioned, if we regard that  as  old-fashioned.  We
do not have a fully computerised system of traceability up  to  the  deepest
areas in the traditional areas. It is just not practical at this moment.

But we do have the administrative capacity. As this system  of  traceability
is built up, and it can be done in certain areas and for certain  animals  -
because there is provision for that in the Bill, the scope for elasticity  -
we will need more capacity to run a more sophisticated  system.  This  is  a
Bill that can grow  when  it  eventually  is  implemented.  The  regulations
provide the elasticity. We must be able to do what is needed  at  a  certain
time in history, and what we need now is  what  we  have  got.  Hon  members
should just remember that a register does exist and  we  are  improving  the
current system dynamically with what is being done here at the moment.

Regarding pets and bringing them into this system, it can  be  done.  If  we
look at clause 2 of the Bill, the Minister can declare that  all  cats  must
be tattooed, etc. But this has a lot of implications if we have  to  inspect
all the cats in this country.  For  that  we  will  need  capacity,  because
inspectors must be able to go out.

Regarding the point Mr Durr made about game farming, provision can  also  be
made for that. Game farming is growing exponentially in South Africa at  the
moment, and we do have disease problems. That  is  the  main  worry  at  the
moment. For example, there are problems with  wildebeest  being  moved  into
areas where cattle are normally farmed. I have forgotten  the  English  name
of these disease ``snotsiekte'' [bovine  malignant  catarrhal  fever]  which
poses a very big problem, because at the moment there is really nothing  one
can do about it from a pharmaceutical point of view. It is  all  a  question
of control and seeing where one has to control.  Sometimes  one  should  not
control things because the expenses are not worth it. It is  a  question  of
economics.

I think this is a thing which the department can now work out. They  have  a
framework in terms of which they can now  introduce  a  good  administrative
system. I am sorry that it  is  a  bit  old-fashioned  and  that  we  cannot
introduce microchips and computers for the whole South  Africa,  but  it  is
simply not practical at this stage. However, it can be developed. We have  a
plan available.

The point about the skins is, valid of course. I have already  commented  on
that. In some areas skins are problematic at the moment.  The  problem  with
the ostrich industry, for example, is that they cannot sell all  the  skins,
which constitute an integral part of the ostrich industry.  The  demand  for
ostrich meat has grown far quicker than the demand for the  skins.  This  is
an economic problem, but this system provides for answers in this regard.

On the issue of welfare, I think there is work going on. It is actually  not
relevant at the moment, but the question has been asked. The  department  is
currently working on amalgamating the Acts which deal with  welfare  issues.
This is a very complicated process, because it must  provide  for  different
cultural  practices,  for  example,  for  kosher  or   halala   slaughtering
practices, which must be provided for  in  the  cultural  set  up  of  South
Africa, and regarding which people have fundamental rights.
I thank members for the debate. It has been extremely  interesting.  Let  me
just see if there is anything else.  About  the  question  of  affordability
asked by a member of the UDM, the department has given  an  opportunity  for
an  identification  system  which  is  user-friendly.  That  is  agreed   by
everyone. We also believe that it is affordable.

I think what must be developed - and we must also ask the department  to  do
this properly - are the marking operators for which the Bill provides.  This
is a new thing. We need to get honesty into the system. There are a  lot  of
opportunities now for new operators  to  register  with  the  department.  I
really hope that this will be an empowering exercise,  and  I  will  request
the department to provide for this.

A person, or two or three, can get a bakkie and go round to  all  the  areas
and, for a reasonable fee, mark animals in  the  proper  manner.  They  will
know how the system works, get some training - the  department  has  assured
me they will give training in this regard  -  and  we  can  get  some  small
businesses going. These marking operators will give a  quick  and  efficient
service at a reasonable price.

But the system is elastic. We can use microchips.  That  is  possible  under
the present system. The system will range  from  cheap  processes,  such  as
tattooing, to expensive systems such as microchips. It  is  possible  to  do
that. The department's role is  to  inform  the  public  and  to  help  them
establish the most  reliable  methods  of  identification  applicable  to  a
specific area. That is why we even make  provision  for  poor  areas,  where
farmers' associations can keep one registration mark for  a  lot  of  people
who only have a few cattle. Not everyone has to get his own  identity  mark.
A traditional authority can have one mark  for  the  whole  community,  with
differentiation among them.

I think this is a wise Bill. We must just administer it in the best  way  we
can, with our available capacity. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

          VETERINARY AND PARA-VETERINARY PROFESSIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  the
Veterinary  and  Para-Veterinary  Professions  Amendment  Bill,  as  I  said
earlier this afternoon, is a typical amending Bill, which is perhaps not  as
elegant as the one we have just debated. It makes  provision  for  what  one
could call the transformation of the SA Veterinary Council.  The  objectives
of the Bill, and the Act as a whole, are to regulate the practising  of  the
veterinary and para-veterinary professions, and the  council  also  has  the
function of advising the Minister on matters affecting these professions.

What the Bill does,  is  to  propose  amendments  to  the  present  internal
constitutional structure of the SA Veterinary  Council.  I  think  the  most
important purpose here is to make this important council  representative  of
the demographics of South Africa.

I must say, in the portfolio committee of the  National  Assembly  extensive
amendments were made to the Bill that was introduced in Parliament.  One  of
the interesting things which they included is that the Minister must  inform
the parliamentary committees, including the select committee  of  the  NCOP,
in writing about the appointment, election or resignation of members of  the
council. This will ensure that the information is passed  on  so  that  both
committees of Parliament can exercise their duties in keeping  the  Ministry
and the executive accountable. That opportunity is created by this Bill.

The Bill also provides that veterinary surgeons  who  want  to  practise  in
private companies, and not only  in  close  corporations  or  in  their  own
names, will be able to do so, as is the case with  some  other  professions.
The reason we had to take another look at this Act was that the  composition
of the council was no  longer  in  comformity  with  present-day  realities,
requirements  and  provisions.  This  was  also  a  constitutional  problem,
because the Act was not in line with the principles which  we  find  in  the
new Constitution, and also, actually, which we already had  in  the  interim
constitution.

What happened was that a working group was established,  already  under  the
previous  Ministry,  and  a  very  long  process  followed.  Workshops  were
conducted,  stakeholders  were  consulted  and  written   submissions   were
received. This Bill - I must say this here today - took too long to come  to
Parliament. As long ago as June 1995, a workshop  on  the  restructuring  of
the council was held. Concerns were raised  and  the  restructuring  of  the
present council was started. There was a request  that  the  Act  should  be
amended. Here, at last, we have the result of that process, as Cicero  said:
``tandem aliquando''. At last we have the result here.

I must say that I fully support the work that  was  done  in  the  portfolio
committee of the National Assembly. A lot of amendments were made. The  Bill
was really not elegantly formulated. The description of the  composition  of
the council had to be redone by the portfolio committee in  Parliament.  The
original drafter of this Bill cannot be traced. We do not know where it  was
done and by whom, but it was definitely not drafted by the persons  who  are
now trying to administer this Bill. It was a very  complicated  process.  It
was almost like the Codesa and Kempton Park negotiations to  get  this  Bill
here.

Count Bismarck was not much of a democrat, but he once said that there  were
two things of which the public should never know the way they were made.  He
was a German, therefore one was sausages. The public  should  not  know  how
sausages are made. The other thing was Acts of parliament. [Laughter.] I  am
not saying anything, but sometimes it is almost like making sausages to  get
the Bills here in Parliament.

Well, we have this Bill now, and I think it is good as it is at the  moment.
The NCOP's select committee had an impact on it and found new faults,  quite
rightly so. It is this type of thing,  ``section  5(2)(f)  or  (g)  must  be
substituted by section 5(2)(a), (d), (e),  (f)  or  (g)'',  those  types  of
details.

In actual fact, we have good legal advisers in Parliament, but  I  would  be
happy if we had more of them, people  who  could  look  at  these  Acts  and
assist the committees with every Bill, especially ones  such  as  this  one,
which has all these amendments, with ``delete  this''  and  ``amend  that'',
just to be sure that everything has been done.

In clause  3  some  things  have  been  inserted  which  I  do  believe  are
necessary. For example, clause 3 states that one of the requirements of  the
council is that a person must be a veterinarian or a veterinary  specialist.
They forgot that now, in  terms  of  the  Act,  para-veterinaries  are  also
included on the council. If one did not check that and  someone  found  this
out, it would have been wrong. The words ``where it is required''  have  now
been added.
I think I must compliment the select committee, as  well  as  the  portfolio
committee, on the good work they have done. They  have  actually  looked  at
this Bill twice and still found mistakes. I hope all the mistakes  have  now
been removed from  this  Bill.  In  one  place  it  referred  to  ``standing
committee'' when it should have referred to ``council''. This makes  a  huge
difference. I simply do not know why the Bill came to Parliament in such  an
ill-prepared state. We have to take responsibility for  this,  and  we  have
already been taken to task in the National Assembly.  We  can  only  promise
that next time Bills will be better and look like the Animal  Identification
Bill that members have before them.

This Bill will do the work that is required of  it.  I  am  sure  that  this
council will now be transformed. There is a problem  in  South  Africa  with
the transformation of the veterinary  profession.  We  simply  do  not  have
enough black veterinarians in this country. I believe  that  the  number  is
something like 200 at the moment. That is my information.  That  is  a  very
small percentage.

I, together  with  the  chief  director  responsible,  who  is  present  and
listening to us today, have started working with  Onderstepoort  faculty  to
make bursaries available, because it is very expensive to  study  veterinary
science. I am informed that it costs something like R30  000  a  year,  that
is, if one stays in residence. I do not know whether  it  can  be  done  any
cheaper.

We are working on this matter and some good work has already been  done.  It
will be developed further. The interesting thing is  that  if  one  goes  to
Onderstepoort, one notices  that  this  profession  is  becoming  a  women's
profession. Seventy percent of students at Onderstepoort are women. That  is
a good thing, but we need men there as well. We hope that they are  not  all
leaving this profession.  What  is  drawing  a  lot  of  women  is  the  pet
industry, because one is going to have a  nice  practice  in  a  nice  city,
looking after beautiful cats and dogs. This is good and  must  be  done.  We
appreciate that work, but the commercial work must still be done.

Today one cannot be a good milk farmer without a  veterinarian.  Perhaps  15
years ago one could be, but today one must almost have the vet next  to  one
if one wants to farm properly. We need the vets.  This  profession  must  be
transformed, and we hope that this council will  now  lead  and  drive  this
process. I think that this profession should be popularised more  and  built
up.

I will gladly listen to the debate. [Applause.]

[Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs and hon members of this House, pride goes before a fall.

Everything has an end. In a series  of  campaigns  to  change  laws  of  the
former South African government to be in  line  with  democratic  practices,
the aim of this  Bill  is  doing  away  with  apartheid  and  discriminatory
practices so that we can affirm the culture of reconciliation and  unity  of
citizens of this region of Africa.

Allow me to conclude the introduction of my speech by saying: Normally,  the
milk from the cow is clean and pure, but the contamination is often  brought
about by the one who milks. The aim of this Bill is to  glean  the  remnants
of apartheid's flotsam that was caused by the former government.]

It is self-evident that a restructuring  of  the  South  African  Veterinary
Council is essential for the rational delivery  of  veterinary  services  to
all South Africans. The legislation providing for the establishment  of  the
present council is a relic of our legacy, of  the  past,  and  many  of  its
provisions are out of touch with the requirements of our new  constitutional
order. The original Act, for example, required proficiency in Afrikaans  and
English, which are  no  longer  the  only  two  official  languages  in  the
country.

The amendments to the original Act are important for a  number  of  reasons.
These include the need for the council to become more representative of  our
population; the need to stop the continuing exclusion of certain members  of
the South African population  from  the  profession  as  a  result  of  past
policies and admission requirements; the need to address  the  concern  that
the majority of members of the present  council  are  academics,  causing  a
sector  imbalance  with  regard  to  representation;  the  predominance   of
representation from a single province, eg Gauteng;  and  the  importance  of
taking the needs of previously disadvantaged communities into account.

Enabling national legislation to redefine the composition and  functions  of
this statutory body is even more important in terms of the globalisation  of
trade. The credibility of our veterinary health services is  a  prerequisite
for market access. The future of  our  country's  meat  export  industry  is
fully dependent on the international acceptance and acknowledgement  of  the
professional  integrity  and  credibility  of  South   Africa's   veterinary
profession and  its  ability  to  comply  with  international  standards  in
respect of veterinary hygiene, consumer health and animal welfare.

Looking at the above challenges, how do the new amendments fare  in  dealing
with those challenges? Do the amendments address those challenges? First  of
all, if one looks at the need to make  the  council  representative,  it  is
clear that the amending Bill does indeed  address  the  question  of  racial
representivity. The amendment allows the Minister to appoint two persons  to
the new council. In addition to these two people, nonveterinarians who  will
be responsible for representing the interests  of  consumers  of  veterinary
services must also be appointed to the council.

Secondly, in dealing  with  the  problem  of  exclusion  of  the  previously
disadvantaged from the profession, the amending Bill succeeds in  addressing
this challenge. The  Bill  empowers  the  council  to  relax  the  admission
requirement for the profession by allowing the council to accept  a  degree,
diploma or certificate  not  prescribed  under  the  original  Act  for  the
purpose of registration of the holder thereof to practice  as  a  veterinary
or para-veterinary professional.

This will open the door to  many  people  who,  in  terms  of  the  original
admission  requirements,  would  not  have  been   able   to   practice   as
veterinarians or para-veterinarians. Therefore, the ANC supports this  Bill.
[Applause.]
Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, a very wise man  once  said:  ``If  you  have
nothing to say, say it.'' I do  not  have  a  lot  to  say  this  afternoon,
because the main reason for this amending Bill is to change the  composition
of the council to that of a  more  representative  one  in  terms  of  race,
gender, region - as in province - and language.

The DP's concerns about the composition of the council and the  relationship
of the council to the Medicines Control Council have been addressed  in  the
amended version. The Bill is not controversial, and the DP is,  contrary  to
popular propaganda, not against transformation. Therefore, the  DP  supports
this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, we support the provisions of this  Bill,  making
the veterinary and para-veterinary professions more representative.  As  the
Minister said in his  introductory  remarks,  agriculture,  with  particular
reference to stock raising, is a great  national  enterprise  in  which  our
whole country and all our people are engaged. It touches all our  lives.  It
is therefore proper that our people should be represented in the proper  way
where these matters are decided and where  things  happen  that  affect  the
industry.

It is also true to say, however, that discrimination is always a bad  thing.
It was bad in the past, and it will be bad in the future.  I  have  to  tell
the Minister that today's positive discrimination becomes tomorrow's  unfair
labour practice. Therefore, I believe that  whenever  we  do  this  kind  of
thing, necessary though it may be, that it be  part  of  transformation  and
temporary. We should maybe put a sunset clause on it, and review the  matter
again in 10 years' time. So that then  later  we  can  return  to  a  proper
system which is not based on discrimination, positive or negative.

The Minister will  know  that  it  is  essential  to  maintain  the  highest
possible technical standards in this field. It  is  vital  to  the  nation's
health, and it is vital that  our  institutions  retain  the  confidence  of
consumers both in South Africa  and  abroad.  The  Minister  will  know,  we
talked about traceability.
The EU veterinarians will tell one which egg every  ostrich  came  from  and
which pen it came from. They will trace it right to one's farm; they  do  it
now - today. Whereas before the EU had fences of excise duties and  tariffs,
today they have fences of regulations and health standards.  If  one  cannot
jump through those hoops, one does not have any ability  to  trace  at  all,
and, unless one has the highest possible standards, adhere to them and  have
confidence in them, one simply cannot be in the business.

For us agriculture is an important business, because  we  are  only  one  of
seven countries in the world that is  a  net  food  exporter,  that  is,  we
export more food on a net basis than what we import. For us  it  is  also  a
major source of added value with processed and packaged food. So  whilst  we
support this and say that it is vital to take whatever steps we  can  to  be
inclusive in all of our public affairs, this must not lead  to  a  lessening
of tariffs. The Minister has seen what happens if we just  let  go  for  one
second, for instance what  happened  in  KwaZulu-Natal  with  foot-and-mouth
disease. One must look at  what  happened  in  the  United  Kingdom  -  they
slaughtered 3,5 million cattle. It is unbelievable what happened there.

We take our standards for granted so easily. But I want to tell the  Council
that it is a thin line. It is a  very  thin  line.  Tomorrow  one  can  find
oneself in the most unbelievable situation which perhaps one cannot get  out
of. One only has to look at parts of some of our neighbouring  countries  to
know that. We must never take for granted the hard-won  standards  of  stock
health that we have in South  Africa.  We  have  to  jealously  guard  them,
because if one lets go for a minute, they are gone and once they  have  gone
one battles to get the markets and the stock back. And we know what  a  long
cycle that is. As far  as  disease  is  concerned,  we  live  in  a  hostile
environment. When I was in Australia, visiting a friend of  mine  who  is  a
big farmer there, we took an aeroplane to  his  farm.  He  visits  his  farm
twice a year. [Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! This is international day of a range  of
languages and the presiding officers continue  their  efforts  to  encourage
members to use all the languages of South Africa.

HON MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

Dr E A  CONROY:  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  hon  members  of  the
Council, the purpose of the Bill under consideration  is  the  restructuring
of the veterinary council which exists in terms of the Veterinary and  Para-
Veterinary Professions Act  of  1982.  The  main  reason  for  amending  the
existing Act is to transform the composition of the  council,  which  became
necessary owing to,  firstly,  the  exclusion  of  certain  members  of  the
population as a result of past policies and the  admission  requirements  of
academic institutions; secondly, the need for  representation  in  terms  of
race  and  gender;  thirdly,   the   sector   imbalance   with   regard   to
representation as the majority of the council  members  are  academics  and,
fourthly, the necessity of taking the needs and requirements  of  previously
disadvantaged communities into account.

It was also mentioned that the predominance of representation  from  Gauteng
was a problem. Now, we thoroughbred Gautengese do not have  a  problem  with
our predominant presence on  the  council,  because  our  professionals  are
simply the best. However, we realise and accept that  we  cannot  allow  the
other provinces to suck on the hind teat  -  if  I  may  express  myself  in
strictly veterinary and anatomical terms.

Transformation is also  served  in  another  sphere,  namely  that  a  wider
variety of persons and expertise will be drawn to the profession.  This  can
only be to the advantage of a profession which is highly regarded  and  held
in high esteem, not only in South Africa, but also far  beyond  the  borders
of our country, in Africa and on other continents.

The Bill also seeks to allow veterinarians  to  form  private  companies  in
addition  to  close  corporations,  and  to  protect  the   public   against
malpractice by ensuring that  the  directors  of  such  companies  are  also
shareholders  in  the  relevant  companies.  These  amendments  will  enable
veterinarians with foreign qualifications  to  become  specialists  if  they
pass the applicable examinations.

The amendments are designed to serve the  above-mentioned  purposes  and  do
not hold any financial implications for the state. The New NP  supports  the
Bill. [Applause.]

[Mr R  M  NYAKANE:  Chairperson,  I  rise  here  to  represent  the  UDM  in
supporting this Bill today, as there are no  obstacles.  Again,  we  welcome
the council that is going to be established, which will embrace  all  people
without discrimination by other nations. We support this Bill  and  want  it
to be implemented. [Applause.]]

Mr V  V  Z  WINDVOëL:  Mgcinisihlalo,  ngitsandza  kubonga  kakhulu  kutfola
litfuba lekutsi ngibe yincenye yalenkhulumomphikiswano. [Chairperson,  I  am
greatly honoured to be given an opportunity to participate in this debate.]

In the Janauary 8 statement of the ANC, Comrade President Thabo Mbeki  said,
and I quote as follows:


  Nowhere else on our continent was there to be devised a system as inhuman
  as that experienced by the Africans of South Africa, of  the  attempt  to
  imprison the indigenous majority in rural ghettos.

the statement went on to say that:


  We have to wage an unrelenting struggle to  ensure  that  all  organs  of
  state and public institutions represent and pursue the ethos of  equality
  and respect for human rights.
The Bill before us is monumental in the  sense  that  it  provides  for  the
restructuring of the  SA  Veterinary  Council,  which  was  untouchable  for
decades. The composition of the SA Veterinary Council excludes the  majority
population of South Africa and is therefore not in line with the  principles
laid down in our Constitution.

The Veterinary and Para-Veterinary Professions  Act  of  19  of  1982  is  a
creation of the old  order.  One  need  just  look  at  section  14  of  the
principal Act,  which  discriminated  against  professionals  who  were  not
proficient in both languages, namely English and  Afrikaans.  In  this  era,
when we have 11 official languages, this  is  totally  unconstitutional.  We
thus welcome the proposed amendment that requires that such  persons  should
be proficient in at least two official languages,  one  of  which  shall  be
English. These will go a long way towards enabling  these  professionals  to
communicate with persons of other backgrounds. Such an amendment  will  also
accommodate veterinarians and para-veterinarians who studied  outside  South
Africa and are thus not proficient in Afrikaans.
The principal Act, which we are amending today, made reference to  the  male
gender only. There is a section which emphasises and refers only to  ``he'',
``his'' and ``himself'', simply meaning that it was meant for Ben,  Jim  and
Benjamin, who  were  the  only  ones  to  take  part  in  this  sector.  The
amendments ensure that our womenfolk have a role to  play  in  this  sector,
paving the way for untapped potential. The hon Deputy Minister  has  already
alluded to the fact that we are seeing  women  going  into  this  sector  en
masse, thus eradicating the legacy of a repugnant contempt  for,  domination
of discrimination against the majority of our people.

The Bill  also  regulates  the  admission  requirements  regarding  academic
qualifications, as the principal Act excluded certain members of  the  South
African population. I can proudly  say  that  this  Bill  provides  for  the
weighing up of competing  values  and  ultimately  an  assessment  based  on
proportionality, which calls for the balancing of  different  interests.  It
does this by addressing  the  concern  that  the  majority  of  the  current
members of the council are academics, which causes a sector  imbalance  with
regard to representation,  by  providing  previously  excluded  sectors  the
opportunity to take part in the council of such an important  profession  in
the country of their birth. This should be commended.

This problem has been resolved by furnish the  hon  the  Minister  with  the
power to appoint members from other sections of the  veterinary  profession.
In short, it provides for the  examination  of  candidates  with  veterinary
degrees that are not recognised by the existing council.

The provision for the registration  of  private  companies  to  practise  in
terms of this Act is also welcomed. It not only gives the private sector  an
opportunity, but also enhances  partnership  in  the  struggle  to  overcome
racial, gender and geographic disparities. We  have  to  continue  with  our
efforts to ensure that  this  empowerment,  while  basing  itself  on  sound
business practices, benefits as many people as possible.

As the ANC, we would  like  to  pledge  our  unconditional  support  to  the
Ministry on  the  passage  of  this  Bill,  as  we  feel  that  it  is  both
constitutional and desirable. [Applause.]

Die ADJUNK-MINISTER VIR LANDBOU EN GRONDSAKE:  Voorsitter,  kan  ek  miskien
iets in Afrikaans sê, want dit sal soveel makliker  vir  my  wees,  want  my
``is`se'' en -``are`s'' is nooit reg in Engels nie.  Ek  kom  maar  van  die
Agterveld af, daar in  die  Wes-Vrystaat,  waar  daar  nie  een  persoon  op
Boshoff was wat Engels gepraat het nie. Daar is Tswana gepraat  en  daar  is
Afrikaans gepraat, maar daar was nie een  persoon  wat  in  sy  huis  Engels
gepraat het nie. Dit maak dit vir my baie swaar as 'n mens grootword  en  jy
moet Engels praat. As ek maar liewer ordentlik Tswana  geleer  het,  kon  ek
dalk ver gekom het.

Wat is visie in velde soos  hierdie?  Toe  die  runderpes  uitbreek  in  die
negentigerjare van die negentiende eeu, het Paul Kruger op aandrang  van  sy
sekretaris, Jan Smuts, in Switserland na dr Tyler gaan soek om hierdie  saak
te bestry. Die runderpes het  feitlik  die  ganse  beesbevolking  van  Suid-
Afrika uitgewis. Na die Anglo-Boereoorlog was dit weer eens  Jan  Smuts  wat
gesorg het dat Onderstepoort ordentlik  gefinansier  word,  dat  Tyler  daar
gaan sit en navorsing doen het, en stelsels ontwikkel het om  veesiektes  in
hierdie land te bestry. In daardie dae was hy natuurlik  'n  genie.  Daardie
daad  het  veroorsaak  dat  dit  moontlik  geword  het  om  in   Suid-Afrika
kommersieel met vee te boer. Die ou boer in  die  negentiende  eeu  het  nie
rêrig kommersieel met vee geboer nie. Hulle was bestaansboere. Eers met  die
ontdekking van diamante en later ook van goud, het hulle  'n  bietjie  vleis
begin verkoop.

Daar was te veel probleme met veesiektes en die enkele belangrikste  faktor,
soos mnr Durr geargumenteer het, om landbou in  hierdie  land  suksesvol  te
maak, is dier- en plantsiekteprobleme. Dit is  waarop  die  aandag  van  die
wêreld is. As 'n mens wil uitvoer, gaan mens geld maak. Ons  staan  'n  kans
om baie goed uit te voer. Veral vleisuitvoere na Saoedi-Arabië en die Midde-
Ooste lyk goed. Alles gaan oor die sanitêre maatreëls. Ons kan  nie  uitvoer
na Amerika toe nie, omdat ons met ons beesvleis  nie  kan  voldoen  aan  hul
vito-sanitêre en sanitêre vereistes nie. Proteas  kan  ons  nie  uitvoer  na
Amerika toe nie. Daar is geld te maak. As ons na Amerika  kan  uitvoer,  kan
tot vier groot voerkrale in die tradisionele gebiede gebou word en  dit  kan
groot geld inbring. Ons kan drie verdere voerkrale kry so groot soos wat  op
die oomblik in Mpumalanga in die kommersiële area staan as ons beesvleis  na
Amerika kan uitvoer. Dan moet ons ons veeartsenykundige dienste verbeter  en
dan moet ons die veeartse beskikbaar hê. Dit kan gedoen word.

Daar is nie een voerkraal in die tradisionele gebiede  in  Suid-Afrika  nie.
Dit is soos die agb lid van die UDM gesê het, daar is goeie kulturele  redes
waarom die beesbedryf op 'n sekere wyse in die tradisionele  gebiede  bedryf
word. Daar is ook geen rede waarom ons nie 'n voerkraal van  60  000  beeste
in die Transkei kan kry nie en sodoende vir 'n  klomp  mense  werk  kan  gee
nie. Daar is areas beskikbaar.  Waarom  sal  ons  nie  in  die  tradisionele
gebiede besigheid doen nie? Ons het mense wat daardie werk  graag  wil  doen
en kan doen. Dan moet ons ons veeartsenykundige dienste  hê.  Ek  weet  meer
geld is nodig. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson,  perhaps
I may say something in Afrikaans, because it will be so much easier  for  me
since my ``is's'' and ``are's'' are never correct in English.  I  come  from
the bundu, the Western Free State, where there was not even one  person  who
spoke English. Tswana was spoken and Afrikaans was  spoken,  but  there  was
not one person in Boshoff who spoke English at home. This  makes  it  really
difficult for me as I grow older and have to speak English. If I had  rather
learned to speak Tswana properly, I could possibly have gone far by now.

What is vision in areas such as these? When rinderpest broke out in the  90s
of the 19th century, Paul Kruger, at the insistence of  his  secretary,  Jan
Smuts, went to Switzerland to find Dr  Tyler  to  combat  this  matter.  The
rinderpest practically destroyed  the  entire  cattle  population  of  South
Africa. After the South African War it was once again Jan Smuts who  saw  to
it that Onderstepoort was properly financed, that Tyler  went  there  to  do
research, and develop systems to fight cattle diseases in this  country.  In
those days he was, of course, a genius. That  action  made  it  possible  to
farm commercially with livestock. The old farmers in the  19th  century  did
not really farm commercially with livestock. They were subsistence  farmers.
Only with the discovery of diamonds, and later of gold, did  they  start  to
sell a little bit of meat.

There were too many problems with livestock diseases, and  the  single  most
important factor, as Mr Durr argued, in making a success of  agriculture  in
this country is that of animal and plant disease  problems.  That  is  where
the attention of the world is directed. If one wants  to  export,  one  will
make money. We have a chance of exporting many goods. Meat exports to  Saudi
Arabia and the Middle East look especially promising. Everything relates  to
sanitary measures. We cannot export to America because  our  beef  does  not
comply with their vito-sanitary and sanitary requirements. We cannot  export
proteas to America. There is money  to  be  made.  If  we  could  export  to
America, up to four large feeding-pens could be  built  in  the  traditional
areas and this could generate large sums of money. We could also have  three
more feeding-pens as large as those that are currently in Mpumalanga in  the
commercial area, if we could export beef to  America.  Then  our  veterinary
services will have to improve and  we  must  have  veterinarians  available.
This can be done.

There is not one feeding-pen in the traditional areas of  South  Africa.  It
is as the hon member from the UDM said, there  are  sound  cultural  reasons
why the beef industry is managed in a  certain  manner  in  the  traditional
areas. There is also no reason why we cannot have a feeding-pen with 60  000
cattle in the Transkei and in that way provide work for  a  lot  of  people.
There are areas available. Why do we not  do  business  in  the  traditional
areas? We have people who would gladly do that work and who can do it.  Then
we must have our veterinary services. I know more money is necessary.]

It is about money. We have to put more money  into  veterinary  services  in
this country. It is happening in the new budget. We  have  more  money.  One
cannot do it in a revolutionary way in one year's time, because  one  has  a
person by the name of Trevor Manuel and he does not do things that  way.  We
have to build it up. We are doing well and it is going to grow.  We  have  a
committed section in our department looking at these matters.  That  is  the
way to succeed, as was said by all members in this debate.

I want to thank everyone for a very interesting debate, as well as  for  the
support for this important matter. We must come  back  to  this  House  from
time to time to report back on how this council is doing. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declaration of Vote:

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP wil dit onomwonde stel dat  ons
hierdie wetgewing met die amendemente steun. In die  lig  van  wat  die  agb
Adjunkminister gesê  het  ten  opsigte  van  beurse  wat  toegeken  word  om
veeartse op te lei, is ons bevrees dat die geld vermors  gaan  word,  indien
die taalbeleid van Onderstepoort nie aangespreek word  nie.  Die  taalbeleid
is slegs Engels:  Engels  in  die  klasse,  Engels  in  die  antwoordstelle.
Laasjaar is daar op ons aandrang 'n tydelike reëling getref  om  dit  op  te
skort. Op grond hiervan het ons besware,  maar  ons  stem  nogtans  vir  die
wetgewing. (Translation of Afrikaans declaration of vote follows.)

[Mr A  E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  we  in  the  New  NP  want  to  state
unequivocally  that  we  support  this  legislation,   together   with   the
amendments. In the light of what the hon  the  Deputy  Minister  said  about
bursaries being granted to train veterinary surgeons,  we  are  afraid  that
the money will be wasted if the language  policy  of  Onderstepoort  is  not
addressed. The language policy is English only: English in  the  classrooms,
English in the examination papers. Last year  a  temporary  arrangement  was
made, at our insistence, to suspend this. In  the  light  of  this  we  have
objections, but we shall nevertheless vote in favour of the legislation.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, if you are allowed to  make
a Declaration of Vote, I would ask that you make sure that you are  relevant
to the Bill that we are deliberating. Exam papers  are  not  represented  in
the legislation, as far as I am aware. Please stick to  the  legislation  in
your Declaration of Vote.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

     PROMOTING MOTHER LANGUAGE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND
                   EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT

                        (Matter of Public Importance)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, baie dankie en baie dankie  dat  u  hierdie
onderwerp ook toegelaat het vir bespreking. Dit is baie  belangrik  dat  ons
moet kyk na die waarde van moedertaal. Ek is seker baie  van  die  lede  van
hierdie Raad het die volgende gedig van Keet uit die kop geleer:


  Jou vabond, wag, ek sal jou kry,
  Van jou sal net 'n bloedkol bly ...
  Pardoef! Dis mis! Daar gaan hy weer!
  Maar dood sal hy, sowaar, ek sweer
  My naam is Van der Merwe.

Boerneef sê ook:


  My hart blom wit
  Vir die voshaarnooi
  Pluk heide van die rooiste rooi
  Vir hierdie einste voshaarnooi
  Bellabint my meisiekind
  Dis hartblom wit
  Dis heide rooi
  Vir jou my voshaarmeisiekind!

En my Griekwa-Afrikaanse vriende sê so:


  Al sal ekkie tale van mense en van ingelse praat,
  Ma ek het nou die liefde geloop geryl virrie haat,
  Dan ek hat 'n raaslike paraffienblik gestaat raak.

Voorsitter, en as ek kon sing, sou ek ook nou uit volle  bors  Sarie  Marais
gesing het, want vir my is Afrikaans  my  moedertaal,  die  taal  waarin  ek
droom, waarin ek bid, waarin ek sing, waarin  ek  praat  en  waarin  ek  ook
partykeer skel as ek kwaad is. Vir my is dit die mooiste taal. Ek  hoop  dat
my kollegas uit ander taalgemeenskappe presies net so  voel  oor  hulle  eie
moedertale. Dit is wat ons vandag vier en dit is ook wat ons ná vandag  hier
moet uitdra, naamlik die trots vir die eie en  respek  vir  ander  mense  se
moedertaal. Ons moet ook die verantwoordelikheid neem  om  'n  vreemde  taal
aan te leer.

Daar bestaan nie 'n sterker brugbouer as taal nie. In die lig  van  nasiebou
en die Afrika Renaissance sal ons 'n groot fout begaan as ons die  krag  van
taal onderskat.

Suid-Afrika is 'n land van vele tale, waarvan Engels slegs een is,  maar  op
die oomblik kry Engels voorkeurbehandeling en soms is mens onder die  indruk
dat Engels in sekere regeringskringe as  die  moedertaal  van  die  regering
beskou word. Natuurlik is Engels belangrik, maar ons moet balans bring.  Dit
moet reggestel word, want soos Bengali in 1952 en ander tale  in  1976  deur
een taal bedreig was en dit 'n kruitvat geword het,  kan  dit  weer  gebeur.
Kom ons keer dit, deur bloot gehoor  te  gee  aan  die  Grondwet  van  Suid-
Afrika. Kom ons kry nou die langverwagte taalbeleid  en  Taalwet  goedgekeur
deur die Kabinet en deurgevoer in die Parlement.

Ons is baie dankbaar dat die agb Asmal  moedertaalonderrig  vir  die  eerste
vier jaar goedgekeur het. Ons in die Nuwe NP sal ons egter  saam  met  ander
navorsers beywer om  dit  vir  die  eerste  sewe  jaar  van  'n  leerder  se
skoolloopbaan ingestel te kry. Alle kennis word ingeneem  en  versprei  deur
taal.  Sonder  die   minimum   taalvaardigheid   wat   vir   die   besondere
omstandighede  vereis  word,  bly  kennisinname  en  die   weergee   daarvan
gebrekkig. Alle verworwe  kennis  berus  op  moedertaalontwikkeling.  'n  Té
vinnige  onderdompeling  in  ander  tale,  soos  Engels,   in   Suid-Afrika,
veroorsaak skade wat  nie  maklik  herstel  kan  word  nie.  Ontaligheid  of
taalverwarring is een van die gevolge.

Taalvaardigheid het nie net te make met skool-  of  akademiese  sukses  nie.
Dit lê ná aan die hart van enige kommunikasie en die  daarmee  gepaardgaande
produktiwiteit. 'n Moedertaal word  eers  op  14-jarige  ouderdom  gevestig.
Talle leerlinge uit  ander  inheemse  taalgemeenskappe  ontvang  nog  steeds
aanvanklik onderrig in hulle moedertaal, maar  skakel  selfs  reeds  in  die
tweede en in die sesde  jaar  oor  na  Engels.  Die  meeste  Suid-Afrikaners
voltooi dus hul skoolloopbaan  in  'n  tweede  taal.  By  baie  van  hierdie
skoliere word die moedertaal dus nooit werklik gevestig  nie.  Daar  bestaan
ook afdoende bewyse dat daar 'n direkte verband bestaan  tussen  die  gebrek
aan voldoende  moedertaalonderrig  en  swak  matriekuitslae.  Die  koste  om
moedertaalonderrig in te voer, word dikwels as 'n  verskoning  gebruik.  Dit
is egter belaglik, omdat die indirekte koste van druipelinge  nooit  bereken
en hierteenoor gestel word nie.

Sowat  30%  van  swart  studente  aan  die  Universiteit  van  Pretoria   se
taalvaardigheid in Engels was verlede jaar op  die  vlak  van  'n  graad  7-
leerling  -  standerd  5.  Ek  dink  nie  dit  is  veel  anders   by   ander
universiteite nie. Swak taalvaardigheid lê studente nie net aan bande om  te
studeer nie, maar kos die staat baie geld. Dit het die  staat  verlede  jaar
sowat R1,3 miljard gekos aan druipelinge en uitsakkers wat nie hulle  studie
voltooi het nie.

'n Ander aspek is dat die SAUK ook aangespoor moet word om te  herbesin  oor
die oorklank van opvoedkundige programme om  te  voorsien  in  meer  as  net
hoofsaaklik die Engelse mark. Dit is goedkoper om dít  te  doen  as  om  eie
produksies te doen en ons moet êrens begin. Dit is egter ook  tyd  dat  daar
deur die  regte  mense  by  die  SAUK  geluister  word  na  aanbevelings  om
veeltaligheid te dien. 'n Organisasie soos  Tabema  speel  hier  'n  kundige
rol, maar word geïgnoreer deur  die  besluitnemers.  Miskien  moet  politici
hier betrek word om ook 'n rol te speel, maar ek  weet  politici  word  baie
keer as melaats beskou wanneer daar onderhandel word  buite  die  Parlement.
Dit behoort ook te verander.

Die probleem met moedertaal en veeltaligheid in Suid-Afrika is te  vinde  in
'n gedagte dat tussen talle uitvoerende  mense,  mense  wat  besluite  neem,
veeltaligheid bloot as nog 'n item op die prioriteitslys  gesien  word.  Dan
moet dit mos van die tafel afgevee word. Dit kan nie  anders  nie.  Dit  kan
nie kers vashou met 'n vigsprobleem of armoede nie.

Die Wes-Kaap, KwaZulu-Natal en Gauteng kan soveel nevirapine uitdeel as  wat
hulle wil, maar as die voorsorg, die nasorg en die voorligting  nie  in  die
taal  geskied  wat  die  persoon  die  beste  verstaan   nie,   is   hierdie
lewensbelangrike besluit gedoem tot mislukking en sal mense aanhou sterf.

Hoe kan ons armoede aanspreek as iemand in sy  tweede  of  derde  taal  moet
gaan soebat vir 'n lening om 'n eie besigheid te begin? So kan ons  aangaan.
Selfs hier in die Parlement is dit onbillik as meer as vermoedelik  90%  van
die lede van die Parlement ander tale as Engels as moedertaal het en ons  in
komitees moet gaan sit en landsbelang moet beskerm  en  argumenteer  in  ons
tweede of derde taal. Dit is nou tyd  dat  daarna  gekyk  word  dat  hierdie
bydraes wat nou net verlore gaan, tot  voordeel  van  hierdie  land  gebruik
word. Dieselfde gebeur ook in  die  privaatsektor.  Mense  kan  nie  bydraes
lewer in die taal wat hulle die beste ken nie.

Ons moet so gou as moontlik 'n veeltalige taalforum in  die  Parlement  skep
om te kyk waar ons 'n bydrae kan lewer om die Grondwet  se  taalklousule  'n
werklikheid te maak. Hiermee is ek en  die  Nuwe  NP  reeds  besig.  Ek  het
gister  'n  mosie  gestel   om   die   Parlement   te   bedank   vir   hulle
bereidwilligheid om die eentalige wegwysers op die  Parlement  se  grond  te
wysig. Daar is nou 'n politieke speletjie wat  gespeel  word.  Leë  beloftes
word gemaak van onder meer hofsake. Ons vee dit van die tafel af,  want  ons
weet daar is reeds 'n verbintenis om dit te  verander  en  meertaligheid  te
kry.

Ons het ook die versekering van die Voorsitter van hierdie Raad dat  wanneer
ons nuwe raadsaal voltooi is, daar tolkdienste sal wees ook  vir  die  mense
op die gallery. Daarom  moet  ons  vandag  vir  ons  gaste  op  die  gallery
verskoning vra, aangesien hulle nie die totale debat sal kan volg nie,  want
dit is 'n veeltalige debat. Ek is egter oortuig hulle sal die  ``ambience'',
die gevoel, die welwillendheid van Afrikaans  en  die  ander  inheemse  tale
saam met ons kan ervaar.

Ek wil die agb Mushwana bedank, asook u, Voorsitter, vir  die  meertaligheid
wat u by uitnemendheid vandag verder in hierdie debat ingebring het. Ek  wil
'n beroep doen op ons kollegas dat ons die beeld van PanSAT moet  help  bou.
Dit is 'n onafhanklike grondwetlike liggaam met die opdrag om  taalregte  te
beskerm en die inheemse tale te help ontwikkel. 'n Geruime  tyd  gelede  het
ek namens die Nuwe NP 'n voorstel vir  wetgewing  ingedien,  die  sogenaamde
Van Niekerk-voorstelle, om PanSAT afdwingingsmag te gee. Dit is wyd  in  die
komitees  gedebatteer  en  dit  is  einde  verlede  jaar  aangebied  by  die
Departement  van  Kuns,  Kultuur,  Wetenskap  en  Tegnologie.   Die   eerste
raadsitting van PanSAT het daaroor besluit en besin. Dit is nou  terugverwys
na die Departement toe en moet nou net deur die Kabinet goedgekeur word.  Ek
hoop dat dit binnekort  wet  kan  word.  Ongelukkig  het  ons  niks  in  die
begroting gesien ten opsigte van veeltaligheid nie en dit bekommer as.  [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, thank you and thank you also for  allowing
this topic for discussion. It is very important for us to look at the  value
of mother languages. I am certain many of the members of this  House  learnt
the following poem by Keet by heart:


  Jou vabond, wag, ek sal jou kry,
  Van jou sal net 'n bloedkol bly ...
  Pardoef! Dis mis! Daar gaan hy weer!
  Maar dood sal hy, sowaar, ek sweer
  My naam is Van der Merwe.

Boerneef also says:
  My hart blom wit
  Vir die voshaarnooi
  Pluk heide van die rooiste rooi
  Vir hierdie einste voshaarnooi
  Bellabint my meisiekind
  Dis hartblom wit
  Dis heide rooi
  Vir jou my voshaarmeisiekind!

And my Griqua Afrikaans friends say the following:


  Al sal ekkie tale van mense en van ingelse praat,
  Ma ek het nou die liefde geloop geryl virrie haat,
  Dan ek hat 'n raaslike paraffienblik gestaat raak.

Chairperson, and if I could sing, I would also now sing Sarie Marais at  the
top of my voice, because  for  me  Afrikaans  is  my  mother  language,  the
language in which I dream, in which I pray, in which  I  sing,  in  which  I
speak and in which I also sometimes scold when I am angry. To me it  is  the
most beautiful language. I hope that my  colleagues  from  other  linguistic
communities feel exactly the same way about their mother languages.

That is what we are celebrating today and that is also  what  we  must  take
out of here after today, namely pride for our  own  and  respect  for  other
people's mother language. We must also accept the responsibility to learn  a
new language. There is no greater  bridge  builder  than  language.  In  the
light of nation-building and the African Renaissance we  will  be  making  a
big mistake if we underestimate the power of language.

South Africa is a land of many languages, of which English is only one,  but
at the moment  English  is  receiving  preferential  treatment  and  one  is
sometimes under the impression that in certain  Government  circles  English
is considered the mother language of the Government. Of  course  English  is
important, but we must have balance. This must be rectified, because in  the
same way that Bengali in 1952 and other languages in  1976  were  threatened
by one language and this became a powder keg, it could happen again. Let  us
prevent this, by simply complying with the  Constitution  of  South  Africa.
Let us now have the long-awaited language policy and language  Act  approved
by the Cabinet and passed by Parliament.

We are very grateful  that  the  hon  Asmal  has  approved  mother  language
instruction for the first four  years.  However,  we  in  the  New  NP  will
strive, together with other researchers, to have  this  instituted  for  the
first seven years of a pupil's school career. All knowledge is taken in  and
disseminated by language. Without the minimum language proficiency which  is
required for the particular circumstances,  knowledge  acquisition  and  the
reproduction thereof will remain inadequate. All  acquired  knowledge  rests
on mother language development.  To  be  immersed  in  other  languages  too
quickly, as is the case with English in South Africa,  causes  damage  which
is not  easily  rectified.  A  lack  of  language  acquisition  or  language
confusion is one of the consequences.

Linguistic proficiency is not only  involved  with  scholastic  or  academic
success.  It  is  the  core  of  any  communication  and  the   productivity
associated with it. A mother language is only established at the age  of  14
years. Numerous pupils from  other  indigenous  linguistic  communities  are
still receiving instruction initially in their mother language,  but  switch
over to English in the second and in the sixth year  already.  The  majority
of South Africans  therefore  complete  their  school  career  in  a  second
language. In many of these pupils the mother  language  is  therefore  never
properly established. Conclusive  evidence  also  exists  that  there  is  a
direct connection between a lack of  adequate  mother  language  instruction
and  poor  matric  results.  The  cost  of   introducing   mother   language
instruction is often given as an excuse. However,  this  is  absurd  because
the indirect cost of those who fail is never calculated and contrasted  with
this.

The  linguistic  proficiency  in  English  of  approximately  30%  of  black
students from the University of Pretoria last year was at  the  level  of  a
Grade 7 pupil - standard 5. I do not think the situation is  very  different
at other universities. Poor linguistic  proficiency  does  not  only  hamper
students in their studying but costs the state a great deal of  money.  Last
year the failed candidates and drop-outs who did not complete their  studies
cost the state approximately R1,3 billion.

Another aspect is that the SABC must also be encouraged  to  reconsider  the
dubbing of educational programmes to provide for more  than  just  primarily
the English  market.  This  is  cheaper  to  do  than  to  produce  original
productions and we must start somewhere. However, it is also time  that  the
right  people  at  the   SABC   listened   to   recommendations   to   serve
multilingualism. An organisation like Tabema plays a specialised role  here,
but is  ignored  by  the  decision-makers.  Perhaps  politicians  should  be
involved here to play a role as well, but I know that politicians  are  very
often considered leprous when there  are  negotiations  outside  Parliament.
This should also change.

The problem with mother language and multilingualism in South Africa  is  to
be found in an idea that among numerous executive people,  people  who  make
decisions, multilingualism is merely viewed as  just  another  item  on  the
priority list. Then it must surely be wiped from  the  table.  There  is  no
other solution. It cannot hold a candle to an Aids problem or poverty.

The  Western  Cape,  KwaZulu-Natal  and  Gauteng  can  distribute  as   much
nevirapine as they wish, but if the  precautions,  the  after-care  and  the
counselling do not take place in the language which  the  people  understand
best, these vitally important decisions are doomed  to  failure  and  people
will continue dying.

How can we address poverty when someone has to beg in his  second  or  third
language for a loan to begin his own business? We  could  continue  in  this
vein. Even here at Parliament it is unreasonable  when  probably  more  than
90% of the members of Parliament have languages other than English as  their
mother languages,  and  we  have  to  sit  in  committees  and  protect  the
interests of the country and argue in our second or third  language.  It  is
now time to look at these contributions, which are  currently  simply  being
lost, being utilised to the benefit of this country. The same thing is  also
happening in the private sector. People cannot  make  contributions  in  the
language which they know best.

We must create a multilingual language forum in  Parliament  as  quickly  as
possible  to  look  at  where  we  can  make  a  contribution  to  make  the
Constitution's language clause a reality. The New NP and I are already  busy
with this. Yesterday  I  moved  a  motion  to  thank  Parliament  for  their
willingness  to  amend  the  monolingual  signposts  on  the   parliamentary
premises. Now there is  a  political  game  which  is  being  played.  Empty
promises are made of court cases, amongst other things. We wipe it from  the
table, because we know that there is already a commitment to change  it  and
to achieve multilingualism.

We also have the assurance of the Chairperson of this Council that when  our
new chamber is completed there will also be interpreting  services  for  the
people in the gallery. We must therefore apologise  to  our  guests  in  the
gallery today, as they will  not  be  able  to  follow  the  entire  debate,
because it is a multilingual debate. However, I am convinced that they  will
be able to experience the ambience, the feeling, the goodwill  of  Afrikaans
and the other indigenous languages with us.

I want to thank the hon Mushwana, as  well  as  you,  Chairperson,  for  the
multilingualism which you excellently further introduced into  this  debate.
I want to appeal to our colleagues that we should help build  the  image  of
PanSALB. It is an independent constitutional body with  the  instruction  to
protect language rights and to help  develop  the  indigenous  languages.  A
while ago I submitted a proposal for legislation on behalf of  the  New  NP,
the so-called Van Niekerk proposals, to  give  PanSALB  enforcement  powers.
This was  widely  debated  in  the  committees  and  was  presented  by  the
Department of Arts, Culture, Science and  Technology  at  the  end  of  last
year. The first council meeting of PanSALB decided and considered  this.  It
has now been referred back to the department and must now just  be  approved
by the Cabinet. I hope that it can become law  soon.  Unfortunately  we  saw
nothing in the Budget with regard to multilingualism and this  concerns  us.

Mnu   S   B   NGIDI   (kwaZulu-Natal):   Somlomo   neNdlu   ehloniphekileyo,
umThethosisekelo  waseNingizimu  Afrika   owadwetshwa   ngeminyaka   yo-1996
unikeza izilimi  eziyishumi  nanye  igunya  lokuba  yizilimi  zangokomthetho
okufanele zisetshenziswe kuleli zwe lakithi.

Esigabeni 6(1) zibaliwe zabalulwa lezo zilimi. Kulo  mThethosisekelo  uMbuso
kufanele wenze izimiso eziyoba  impumelelo  ukwenyusa  izinga  nokukhulunywa
kanye nokusetshenziswa  kwalezi  zilimi  ezibaliwe  kumThethosisekelo  ukuze
isithunzi salezo zilimi sikhuphuke, singabi yileso  esasiyisona  ngesikhathi
sobandlululo.

Mhlawumbe okufanele sizibuze khona ukuthi sesikwenzile yini  lokhu  okushiwo
umThethosisekelo?  Kufanele  sibheke  ukuthi  ukuba  besizinikeza  amaphuzu,
mangaki   amaphuzu    ebesizozinikeza    wona    thina    emva    kweminyaka
eyisishiyagalombili    okuthi     sikwenzile     yini     lokhu     okubekwa
ngumThethosisekelo.
umThethosisekelo   uyasho   ukuthi   uHulumeni   omkhulu   noma    uhulumeni
wezifundazwe kufanele usebenzise izilimi ezibalulwe  lapha  esigabeni  6(1).
UHulumeni omkhulu noma wezifundazwe kufanele  ushaye  umthetho  futhi  wenze
izimiso ezithize  ukuze  udlondlobalise  ukusetshenziswa  kwazo  zonke  lezi
zilimi ezibaliwe.

Ngike ngizibuze mina ukuthi  thina-ke  mhlawumbe  esikhuluma  isiVenda  noma
isiShangane noma isiNdebele noma isiSwazi noma isiXhosa ziyenzeka yini  lezi
zinto ezishiwo umThethosisekelo ngoba uma  zingenziwa  lezi  zinto  kufanele
ukuthi  uMbuso,  kungaba  uHulumeni  omkhulu   noma   osezifundazweni   noma
osemakhaya, ubuyele kumThethosisekelo ubheke ukuthi uthini.

Yikuphi thina esesikwenzile ukuze  sihambisane  nemigomo  yomThethosisekelo.
Ayikho  enye  indawo  okufanele  sibheke  kuyona.  Kufanele   sibheke   kulo
mThethosisekelo thina esawemukelayo lapha ezweni lakithi ikakhulukazi  ngoba
umThethosisekelo  wethu  lapha  eNingizimu  Afrika  waziwa   njengophucuzeke
kakhulu kuwo wonke umhlaba.  Waziwa  njengomThethosisekelo  ohamba  phambili
ukudlula  cishe  nalezo  zindawo  okuthiwa  amazwe   aseNtshonalanga   abusa
ngokwentando yeningi. Ngakho umThethosisekelo wethu  uyahlonishwa  emhlabeni
wonke. Kufanele thina njengabantu  abasembusweni,  mhlawumbe  siqale  kuyona
leNdlu siye nakwenzinye iziNdlu nakwezinye izifundazwe senze lokhu  okushiwo
umThethosisekelo.

Okubonakala lapha  ukuthi  le  mibhalo  eminye  etuswayo  ekumThethosisekelo
iletha ithemba kwabaningi. Ibukeka njengamanje  iwutalagu  esizamayo  ukuthi
silubambe  ngezandla  kodwa  kube  kubonakala  ukuthi  cha  umnyama  unamafu
asifiki ndawo.

Izilimi   zakithi    zabomdabu    azihlonishwa    ngokulinganayo    nezilimi
ezinjengesiBhunu    nesiNgisi.    Kuncane    impela    abantu    abaseVenda,
abakwaNdebele,   abakwaZulu-Natali,   amaXhosa   kanye    nezinye    izilimi
abakubonayo okuletha ithemba okwenziwa izigaba lezi  ezintathu  zikahulumeni
zokuthi zithuthukise lezi zilimi zethu emfundweni noma  emabhizinisini  noma
empilweni yethu yonke jikelele.

Empeleni  ngingasho  ukuthi  nakuba  amandla  namagunya  sinawo   ngokunikwa
ngumThethosisekelo   kodwa    okuliqiniso    ukuthi    asihlukile    kakhulu
nokwakwenzeka ngesikhathi sobandlululo. Izindawo lapho kusetshenziswa  khona
izilimi zakithi zabomdabu ziya  ngokuncipha.  Lokhu  ukubona  nasemsakazweni
noma  mhlawumbe  nakomabonakude.  Imisakazo  yethu  naleyo  okufanele  ngabe
ikhuluma izilimi zethu zabomdabu  uyifica  seyifaka  imithonselana  yezilimi
zesiNgisi.

Mina ngiphuma KwaZulu-Natali. Kukhona umsakazo wesiZulu  esiwubiza  ngokuthi
Ukhozi FM. Kunohlelo lapho bona abalubiza ngokuthi  i-  Speak  Out.  Ngiyaye
ngithi uma ngilalele ngizibuze  ukuthi  kwasekuphele  amagama  esiZulu  yini
kuze kuthiwe lolu hlelo lona luzoba u-Speak Out? Into ebonakalayo le  ukuthi
cha izilimi zethu azinikezwa lelo gunya.

Okunye   mhlawumbe   okubulala   izilimi   zethu,   ikakhulukazi   okwenzeka
njengamanje, ukuthi cishe  amalunga  akhona  kule  Ndlu  nakwezinye  iziNdlu
asathatha izingane zawo ayozifundisa kulezi  zikole  okuthiwa  ngo-Model  C.
Lezi zingane zika-Model C zikhula zingalwazi ulimi lwakubo  lwesiVenda  noma
lwesiZulu bese kubukeka sengathi uma ukhuluma lolu olunye  ulimi  okungelona
olwakho ungumuntu ofunde kakhulu nohlonishwayo.

Kuyenzeka lokhu ngoba uyaye ubone nabantu  abaqashwayo  lapha  kumabonakude.
Uma ukwazi ukusiveteza kangconywana isiNgisi uyaye  uthole  umsebenzi  kodwa
uma  ubonakala  njengami  nje   ukuthi   isiNgisi   usishaya   ngokuciciyela
awuwutholi kahle umsebenzi bese lokhu kulekelela  ukuthi  uma  ushaya  kahle
isiNgisi uyawuthola-ke umsebenzi.

Ezinye  zezinto  esingazenza  thina  njengoHulumeni  ukuze   izilimi   zethu
zizosetshenziswa ukuthi mhlawumbe kube nezimiso nemithetho eshaywayo  ukuthi
izilimi  zabomdabu  ezindaweni  ezahlukene   azifundwe   kusukela   eBangeni
lokuqala ezikoleni zethu. [Kwaphela isikhathi.] [Ihlombe.]

USIHLALO WOMKHANDLU WEZIFUNDA KAZWELONKE:  Ngikholwa  ukuthi  nawe  mnumzane
uyangivumela  ukuthi  uma  singaqhubeka  kanje,  sizisebenzise  lezi  zilimi
eziNdlini  zethu  ezinkulu,   sizothola   ukuthi   bonke   abantwana   bethu
bazosihlonipha. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr S B NGIDI (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Speaker and the honourable  House,  the
South African  Constitution,  which  was  drawn  up  in  1996,  declared  11
languages official and that they should be used in this country.

Section 6(1) makes special mention of these languages. In  the  Constitution
it is provided that the Government should pass successful laws  to  increase
the level at which these languages that are entrenched in  the  Constitution
are used and spoken. This should be done to upgrade  their  status  so  that
they will not just remain where they were during the apartheid era.

Now we should ask ourselves if we have done what the Constitution  says.  We
should look at the fact that if we were to give ourselves points,  how  many
points we would give ourselves after eight years,  in  complying  with  what
the Constitution stipulates.

The Constitution says that the national or provincial government should  use
languages that are mentioned in section 6(1).  The  national  or  provincial
government should pass a law and make certain regulations so  that  the  use
of the languages that are mentioned in the Constitution will increase.

Sometimes  I  ask  myself  if  these  things  that  are  mentioned  in   the
Constitution have been done, especially for us who  speak  Venda,  Shangaan,
Ndebele, Swati or Xhosa, because if they have not, the national,  provincial
or local government should go back to the Constitution to see what it says.

What have we done to be in line with the  principles  of  the  Constitution?
There is nowhere else we could look. We  should  look  at  the  Constitution
that we adopted in  this  country,  especially  because  our  South  African
Constitution is known by the world as the most civilised one.  It  is  known
as a far better constitution than those of  other  Western  countries  which
are democratically governed. As  a  result  our  Constitution  is  respected
worldwide. We, as people in power, should start in this House  and  then  go
to other Houses and other provinces to do what the Constitution says.

What  we  see  here  is  that  these  sections  that  are  praised  in   the
Constitution gives many people hope. At the moment they look like  a  mirage
that we are trying to catch with our hands, while at the same time it  looks
as if there is just darkness without a cloud, as if we are getting nowhere.

Our African languages are not  respected  as  being  equal  to  English  and
Afrikaans. Very little makes one hope  that  Venda,  Ndebele,  KwaZulu-Natal
and Xhosa people have seen what is being  done  at  these  three  levels  of
government regarding language development in  education,  business  and  all
areas of life.

In fact, I can say that although we have  power  and  authority,  which  the
Constitution gives us, it is true that we are far removed  from  the  events
that happened during apartheid. Places where African languages are used  are
decreasing. We see this  in  radio  and  television  broadcasts.  The  radio
stations that  should  use  African  languages  are  now  mixing  them  with
English.

I come from KwaZulu-Natal. We have a radio station that we  call  Khozi  FM.
There is a programme that they call Speak Out. Whenever I  am  listening,  I
ask myself whether the Zulu vocabulary is now exhausted as  they  call  this
programme Speak Out, which is an English title. This is a  glaring  example,
which shows that our languages are not given the rights they deserve.

Another thing that destroys our languages that  is  happening  now  is  that
almost all members in this House and in the Other House have enrolled  their
children in Model C schools. These children in Model C schools grow  up  not
knowing their language, which might be Venda or Zulu. Then, when one  speaks
a foreign language, it is because he is highly educated and respected.

These things happen, because  one  sees  the  people  who  are  employed  by
television companies. If you can speak English well you  are  employed,  but
if you are like  me,  who  cannot  speak  English  well,  you  will  not  be
employed. If you speak English well you get the job.

One of the things that we as the Government can do  so  that  our  languages
can be used, is to pass laws which say African languages in different  areas
should be studied from Grade 1 in our schools. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I think that even you,  Sir,  are  with  me  in
that if we continue in this way, using these languages in  superior  Houses,
we will find that all our children will respect them.]

Mntwana B Z ZULU: Somlomo, amalunga ahloniphekileyo,  nina  beSilo,  namuhla
sigubha usuku lokuba khona kwezilimi ezahlukene umhlaba wonke.

Ulimi  esilukhulumayo  yilona  oluba  yisisekelo   sokuba   khona   kwezizwe
ezahlukeneyo  ebusweni  bomhlaba.  Ulimi  luyisipho  esivela  kuMvelinqangi.
Luyiyona ndlela yokuxhumana phakathi komuntu nomuntu kanye nabantu  nomhlaba
wonke.

Unina  wengane  uqala  ukuxoxa  nayo   isesesibelethweni   sakhe.   Uyakwazi
ukwahlukanisa iphimbo lokukhala kwengane yakhe ukuthi  lisho  ukuthini  nayo
ingane into ekwazi ukuyahlukanisa kuqala yizwi likanina okuyilona  eliwulimi
lwakhe. Ingane iyakwazi ukuxoxa nonina ngokukhala futhi naye akuqonde  kahle
ekushoyo. Ingakhala imtshela ukuthi  ilambile  noma  iyozela  noma  isimanzi
noma iyagula kanti futhi ingakhala imtshela ukuthi isidinga uthando  lwakhe.
Konke lokhu ikwenza ngokuxhumana ngolimi eluncela ebeleni likanina.

Kuthi  uma  ingane  izwa  iphimbo  likanina  esondela  kuyo,  izizwe  ithola
imfudumalo nothando  lukanina  ize  igxumagxume  ikhombise  ukumbonga  ngoba
iyaluzwa nayo ulimi alukhulumayo. Phezu kwakho  konke  lokhu  incela  ubuntu
ebeleni. Konke ayifundisa khona uyifundisa  eyiteketisa  eyidlalisa.  Ngisho
noma   ngabe   iyakhala    uyithulisa    ngemilolozelo    futhi    ayithophe
nangezithakazelo zabomndeni wayo.

Ngithi asibabonge-ke sibancome omama  besizwe  ngekhono  labo  lokusigcinela
basifundise  izilimi  zethu  kuze  kube  sesizukulwaneni   lesi   esikusona.
[Ubuwelewele.]

Umlando wanoma yiliphi izwe  usekukhulunyweni  kolimi  lwabantu  abalakhele.
Umuntu ulimi alukhulumayo lukhomba  usikompilo  lomphakathi  akhulele  kuwo.
Ngenxa yomlando omubi  wezwe  lethu  izilimi  zethu  zabomdabu  zacindezelwa
zadicilelwa  phansi,  abantu  bakithi  bahlwithwa   ubuzwe   babo,   baqedwa
isithunzi sabo, benziwa imihambima ezweni abalabelwa uMvelinqangi.

Uma ukhuluma ulimi lomdabu ubuthathwa njengento engelutho, iqaba,  isidlova,
into engaphucuzekanga, kangangokuthi kwaze  kwaba  nabantu  bakithi  okwathi
ngokwenyanya ukwehliswa isithunzi sabo baze bathenga ubuzwe babelungu.  Labo
bantu babaziwa ngokuthi amazemtiti.

Ulimi yilona oluveza obala izizwe ngezizwe indlela  eziphila  ngayo.  Ufunda
olimini lwakhe  umuntu  ukuhlonipha  nokuzithoba  nokuthi  unobuntu.  Ingane
ezalelwe yakhuliswa emndenini  onemfundiso  enhle  iba  nobuntu.  Ayizenyezi
ngeyikho.  Ikhula  izethemba  ukuthi  ikusasa  layo  liyizela   nokuba   ibe
isakhamuzi sezwe esiqotho.

Ulimi lwethu esaluncela ebeleni luyisisekelo sokuchamisela  ubuhle  bamasiko
ethu ehlukahlukene. Namuhla isikhathi sesifikile  sokuba  sikhulume  izilimi
zethu  ezahlukene  ngokuziqhenya.  Kuhle  sikuqonde  kahle  ukuthi   akuzona
ezokuba  sicindezelane  noma  sicwasane  ngazo.  Ubuningi   bezilimi   zethu
ezahlukene eNingizimu Afrika yibo obusenze  saziwa  umhlaba  wonke  ngokuthi
siyisizwe esiwuthingo lwenkosazane.

Sikule Ndlu yezingwevu njengamanxusa amele  izifundazwe  ezikhuluma  izilimi
ezahlukene, kepha kuyadabukisa ukuthi sesibonakala  sengathi  yithina  manje
abantu  bokuqala  abacindezela  izilimi   zabantu   esibamele   kule   Ndlu.
Ukukhuthala kwethu  ukukhuluma  izilimi  zethu  kungavulela  abantu  bakithi
amathuba emisebenzi okuba bazotolika izinkulumo  zethu  esizixoxa  ngezilimi
zethu ezahlukene kule Ndlu.

Njengamanje  sibhekene  nengwadla  yesifo  sengculaza  ebonakala   ibhubhisa
kakhulu isizwe esinsundu.  Imibhalo  yonke  enezincazelo  namasu  okubhekana
nalesi sifo ibhalwe ngezilimi zabezizwe. Ngisho ngabe  kuthiwa  bayasizakala
labo asebehlabekile nalabo abangakaguli,  kepha  abasoze  basizakala  ngenxa
yokuntula ulwazi olubhalwe ngolimi lwabo.

ImiThethosivivinywa yonke esiyenzayo  ibhalwe  ngezilimi  abangazazi  abantu
bakithi. Lokhu kwenza ukuba kube  lukhuni  ukuyiqonda  ukuthi  ithini.  Noma
siya siyokwethula kubo ama-public hearing, kepha  iqiniso  ngukuthi  kuncane
kakhulu esingaqinisa ngokuthi bayakuzwa, ngoba  iningi  labo  abaluzwa  lolu
limi esisuke sikhuluma ngalo.

Izilimi  zethu  zinokucindezelwa  ezikoleni  zemfundo   ephansi,   kubabhali
bezincwadi  nabamaphephandaba,  kanye   emanyuvesi   nakumabonakude.   Lokhu
kucindezelwa  kwezilimi  zabansundu  sekudale   ukuthi   abafundi   abazenza
ezingeni lasenyuvesi banciphe ngoba abaqashwa ndawo. Ngeke  baqashwe  ngisho
lapha ePhalamende yabo  yaseNingizimu  Afrika  ngoba  izilimi  zabo  zomdabu
azikhulunywa. Kubalulekile ukuba  izimali  zokuxhasa  ukufundiswa  kwezilimi
zabomdabu  emanyuvesi  ikhushulwe  ukuze   abafundi   bomdabu   bakhuthazeke
ukuzifunda. Kubalulekile futhi ukuthi umNyango weziLimi  uxhase  ukukhuthaza
izilimi zabomdabu  ezindaweni  zasemakhaya.  Lokhu  ngikusho  ngoba  yilapho
sithola  khona  abantu  abadala  abakhuluma  lezi  zilimi  zethu   zabomdabu
ngokungazingabazi.

Izizwe ezifana namaJalimani, amaJaphani namaShayina zaba  nempumelelo  kukho
konke  ezilkwenzayo  ngoba  konke  ezazikwenza  zazikwenza  ngezilimi   zazo
ezizikhuluma endaweni yazo.

Emandulo  ulimi   lwaludlala   indima   ebaluleke   kakhulu.   Lwaluyindlela
yokudlulisela   amasiko   kanye    nezimfundiso    zesintu    ezizukulwaneni
ngezizukulwane.  Lwaluyindlela   yokwakha   izimilo   nenhlonipho   komncane
nomdala. Ulimi lwakha ukwazisana kubantu abanomlando othile.

Ezinkolweni eziningi zomdabu ubuciko bolimi  bungamandla.  Ulimi  luyindlela
yokuxhumana noMvelinqangi nezinyanya.  Ukukhuluma  nezinyanya  akukhona  nje
ukuchitha  igazi  lesilwane  kuphela,  kepha   kuyaxoxiswana   ngolimi   uma
kukhulunywa  nabalele.  Ulimi  luyisizinda  solwazi.  Ulimi  lwami  lungenza
ngiziqhenye  ...  [Kwaphela  isikhathi.]  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of  Zulu
speech follows.)

[Prince B Z Zulu: Madam Speaker, hon members, you  people  of  his  Majesty,
today we are celebrating the existence of all  the  different  languages  in
the world.

The language we speak becomes the foundation for the existence of  different
nations on the face of this earth. Language is a gift from God.  It  is  the
way of communicating between people and also among the people of the world.

A mother starts communicating with her baby while she  is  giving  birth  to
the baby. She knows the voice of her child when the child cries.  The  child
can differentiate it and the  first  thing  that  the  child  knows  is  his
mother's voice, her language.  A  child  can  communicate  with  her  mother
through crying and the mother can understand well what  the  child  says.  A
child can tell her mother that she is hungry, sleepy or wet or ill  and  she
can cry if she needs  her  mother's  love.  The  child  does  all  these  in
communicating with her mother through the  language  she  gets  through  the
milk from her mother's breast.

When a child hears his mother's voice as she comes to him,  he  gets  warmth
and feels the mother's love. He jumps up to show that he thanks her for  her
understanding of the language he speaks. Above all a child  sucks  the  milk
of humanity from his mom's breast. Everything  that  she  teaches  him,  she
does while she is playing with him. Even when he cries, she sings  lullabies
and his clan praises so that he will stop crying.

We should thank mothers of the nation for their talents, as  they  kept  and
taught us our languages until we reached the generation  we  are  in  today.
[Interjections.]

The history of every country depends on the  language  the  people  of  that
country speak. The language that one  speaks  reveals  the  culture  of  the
community in which one grew up. Because of the unfortunate  history  of  our
country, our African languages were  demeaned  and  looked  down  upon.  Our
people were deprived of their nationhood, their status was  downgraded,  and
they were made to look like herds of animals in the country  that  God  gave
them.

When one spoke  an  African  language  one  was  regarded  as  a  nonentity,
uncivilised, undisciplined and barbaric in such  a  way  that  some  of  our
people, in fear of losing their status, bought the nationhood of  the  white
people. Those people were referred to as the "exempted ones".

Language is something that reveals the kind of lifestyle that  every  nation
has adopted. One learns from one's language how to  show  respect  and  also
the principles of humanity. A child born and brought up  in  a  family  that
has good teachings will have good humanity. That child is confident of  what
he or she is. That child grows up knowing that his or her future brings  her
or him the chances of becoming a good citizen.

The languages that  we  learnt  from  our  mothers  is  the  foundation  for
producing the beauty of our different cultures. Today is the time for us  to
speak our different languages with pride. We must understand  well  that  we
should not use these languages to oppress one  another  or  to  discriminate
against one another. The great number of our different  languages  in  South
Africa is  the  thing  that  has  made  us  known  among  the  international
community as the rainbow nation.

We are  here  in  the  NCOP  as  representatives  of  provinces  that  speak
different languages. It is saddening that now  we  are  seen  as  the  first
people to oppress the languages of the people whom we  are  representing  in
this House. Our effort to encourage people  to  speak  our  languages  could
open up job opportunities to people who can interpret the  debates  that  we
deliver in our languages in this Council.

At the moment we are faced with Aids, which is destroying the black  nation.
Many documents  have  explanations  and  strategies  of  how  to  face  this
disease, but these documents are written in foreign languages.  Even  though
those who are affected by it could get help, they cannot, because they  lack
access to the knowledge that is written in the languages that are not  their
own.

All the Bills that we make here are written in languages that our people  do
not understand. This makes it difficult to  understand  what  they  contain.
Even when we go to present things to them at public hearings, the  truth  is
that they understand very little of what we say, because  many  of  them  do
not understand the language we use.

Our languages are oppressed at junior levels at schools, universities,  even
at the level of book and  newspaper  writers,  and  even  in  the  field  of
television. This oppression of language has caused students who study  these
languages at  university  level  to  decrease  because  they  could  not  be
employed with these languages. Some of them could not even be employed  here
at the Parliament  of  South  Africa,  because  African  languages  are  not
spoken. It is important to increase the funds to sponsor  African  languages
at universities so that students will be encouraged to  study  them.  It  is
also important for  the  department  concerned  with  languages  to  sponsor
African languages in the rural areas. I  am  saying  this  because  that  is
where we get elderly people who speak our languages without any hesitation.

Nations like the Germans, Japanese and Chinese have succeeded in  everything
they did because they did everything in the languages they  speak  in  their
areas.

In the olden times language played a very important role. It was  a  way  of
passing on traditions and teachings of humanity  to  other  generations.  It
was a way of building  character  and  respect  in  the  young  and  adults.
Language creates friendship among people who have a specific history.

In the African religion, language is powerful. It is a way of  communicating
with God and the ancestors. To speak to the  ancestors  is  not  just  about
slaughtering an animal; it is about  speaking  a  certain  language  to  the
dead. Language is the centre of  knowledge.  My  language  makes  me  proud.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Ke tla bitsa  motlotlegi  Gouws.  [I  will  now
call upon the hon Gouws.]

Mev Gouws, ek sien dat jy Engels gaan praat. Ek hoop dat  jy  ook  Afrikaans
sal praat ... of isiXhosa. [Gelag.] [Mrs Gouws, I see that you are going  to
speak English. I hope  you  will  also  speak  Afrikaans  ...  or  isiXhosa.
[Laughter.]]

Ms E C GOUWS: Madam Chair, contrary to what is indicated  on  the  speakers'
list, my speech will be mainly in Afrikaans.

South Africa is a multilingual country with 11 official languages. The  Bill
of Rights in our Constitution states that each  of  these  languages  enjoys
equal status and respect. We must agree  that  achieving  equality  for  all
languages is a tough call, but it is very worthwhile  trying.  Mother-tongue
education, at least at primary school level, is essential  for  equipping  a
person to face the future with confidence.

Ons land, hier aan die suidpunt van Afrika, is in  baie  opsigte  uniek,  en
dan  praat  ons  nie  oor  die  natuurskoon,  klimaat  en  die   suksesvolle
oorskakeling na 'n demokrasie nie. Ons uniekheid lê in sy mense. Ons  beskik
oor soveel tale, gelowe en kulture, en  dit  maak  ons  die  rykste  én  die
blinkste robyn op die vasteland. Die ryke versameling van  tale  en  kulture
wat ons huisves, laat ons toe om soveel meer aan ons land te bied.

Hierdie nasie lê nog braak. Die kundigheid, intellek en  vermoëns  moet  nog
oopgestel word. Ons kinders, die toekoms van hierdie land, moet die  reg  hê
dat die taal wat hul met moedersmelk gevoer is, die medium moet wees  waarin
hulle ontwikkel. Dit is al talle kere bewys dat leesvermoë vinnig  ontwikkel
in 'n moedertaal; syfers makliker en gouer verstaan en verwerk  word  in  'n
kind se moedertaal; en die vermoë om te kommunikeer eers  in  eie  taal  van
kardinale belang is. Selfvertroue en 'n goeie selfbeeld  volg  op  prestasie
in moedertaal.

Nadat die fondament in 'n moedertaal gelê is, sal 'n tweede of  selfs  derde
taal minder verwarring veroorsaak en uiteindelik prestasie  tot  gevolg  hê.
Die volle potensiaal van elke jong leerder in hierdie land moet benut  word.
Die geleenthede is hier. Ons het die materiaal. Ons moet  dit  net  moontlik
maak vir elkeen om die fondament van sy opvoeding op  'n  stewige  basis  te
vestig. Die probleme wat ons nou  as  'n  ontwikkelende  land  ervaar,  soos
byvoorbeeld gebrekkige  kommunikasie,  ontoereikende  werksvermoë,  ywer  en
lojaliteit, is die gevolg van 'n opvoedingstelsel wat mense verwar  het,  en
hul  nie  die  geleentheid  gegun  het  om  die  natuurlike   opvoeding   en
ontwikkelingsproses te ervaar nie.

Daar sit talle mense in die arbeidsmark vandag wat  ongemaklik  voel,  omdat
hul selfvertroue ontbreek  en  omdat  hulle  besef  dat  hulle  nie  volkome
toegerus is vir wat van hulle verwag word nie. Moedertaalonderrig  moet  nie
as 'n luukse beskou word nie. Dit  is  elkeen  se  reg  om  sy  intellek  te
ontwikkel tot so ver sy talente strek, sodat ons waardige en knap mense  vir
ons land se arbeidsmark kan lewer. As ons Suid-Afrika 'n wenland  wil  maak,
moet ons nie die positiewe van moedersmelk en  moedertaal  miskyk  nie.  Ons
moet daarin belê vir ons toekoms.

Niemand, en geen taal, is tweedeklas nie. Jou taal is die medium wat jou  na
hoogtes voer. Jy speel, droom en leer daarin, en as jy  kwaad  is,  rol  dit
oor jou lippe en  jy  bid  daarin.  Ons  taal  behoort  elkeen  se  trotsste
besitting te wees. Dit is jou erfenis, wat niemand van jou kan  vervreem  of
wegneem nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Our country, here at the southern tip of Africa, is unique  in  many  ways,
and then we are not talking  about  its  natural  beauty,  climate  and  the
successful changeover to a democracy. Our uniqueness lies in the people.  We
have so many languages, religions and cultures at  our  disposal,  and  this
makes us  the  richest  and  brightest  ruby  on  the  continent.  The  rich
collection of languages and cultures that we accommodate allows us to  offer
so much more to our country.

This nation still lies fallow. The expertise,  intellect  and  capacity  has
yet to be opened up. Our children, this country's future, deserve the  right
to have the language that was fed to them with their mother's  milk  as  the
medium in which they develop. It has been proven time  and  again  that  the
ability to read develops faster in  the  mother  tongue;  figures  are  more
easily and better understood and absorbed in a child's  mother  tongue;  and
the ability  to  communicate  in  one's  own  language  first  is  of  vital
importance. Self-confidence and a good self-image follow on  achievement  in
the mother tongue.

After the foundation has been laid in the mother tongue, a second  or  third
language will cause less confusion and will eventually lead to  achievement.
The full potential of every young learner in this country must be  utilised.
The opportunities are there. We are the  material.  We  must  just  make  it
possible for everybody to establish the foundation of their education  on  a
sound basis. The problems that we  are  now  experiencing  as  a  developing
country,  such  as  poor  communication,   insufficient   labour   capacity,
diligence and loyalty, for  instance,  are  consequential  to  an  education
system  which  confused  people  without  giving  them  the  opportunity  to
experience the process of education and development in a natural way.

A lot of people in the job market today are  feeling  uneasy,  because  they
are lacking in self-confidence and they realise  that  they  are  not  fully
equipped for that which is  expected  from  them.  Mother  tongue  education
should not be regarded as a luxury. It is everyone's right to develop  their
intellect as far as their talents  may  stretch,  so  that  we  can  deliver
worthwhile and proficient people for our  country's  labour  market.  If  we
want to turn South Africa into a winning country, we should not  ignore  the
positive contained in mother's milk and mother tongue. We must invest in  it
for our future.

Nobody, and no language, is second-class. One's language is the medium  that
transports one to great heights. One plays, dreams and  learns  in  it  and,
when one is cross, it flows from one's lips, and  one  prays  in  it.  One's
language ought to be everybody's proudest possession. It is one's  heritage,
which nobody may alienate or take away from one.]

My colleague over there said something about  the  Afrikaans  poets  and  he
quoted some of them. Well, I am going  to  try  something  on  my  own.  Hon
members have a poet in their midst and they do not know it!

Die volgende is my ode aan moedertaal. [The  following  is  an  ode  to  the
mother tongue.]


  Die mense van Suid-Afrika is ons kosbaarste skat.
  Ons toekoms is gekoester as almal glo in hierdie debat.
  In moederskoot kry jy die melk met die taal.
  Dit, my vriend, is die kern om in die toekoms die beste te behaal.
  Dit is die resep vir groei, ook in selfbeeld en statuur.
  Dit is hulle wat sal veg in loopgraaf, mynveld en vir hul kultuur.
  Kom ons wees trots op ons land en vat hande in solidariteit.
  Kom ons plaas moedertaal eerste, sonder verdere verwyt.

[Applause.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, hon members who  are  here,  language  is  never
static. It lives if we use it and it dies if we do not. It  changes,  adapts
and modifies with  every  profound  influence  in  our  generation  and  our
culture.

As individuals and as a country we have to work  constantly  at  making  our
language relevant in our daily lives. In South Africa today we  are  luckier
than most other countries because our Government is acutely  conscious  that
our language usage is rich and diverse, and  therefore  makes  a  number  of
policy adjustments to actively promote mother tongue usage.

I am very happy to  participate  in  this  debate  that  deals  with  mother
language, and not father language.  I  am  not  against  fathers,  but  this
happens to be mother-tongue celebration. I am proud that  I  come  from  the
Free State and represent the Free State in this debate, because it had  been
the  first  legislature  in  the  country  to   install   the   simultaneous
translation of languages, even long before the national legislature did it.

We are also considerate of all other  languages  in  the  country.  We  have
enabled the public to let us know beforehand  who  needs  a  translator  and
then we make provisions for this. Although  we  focus  on  three  languages,
namely Sesotho,  Afrikaans  and  English,  we  do  provide  translators  for
Setswana and other languages should there be a need to do so.

It is a joy to hear on radio Xhosa, English and Afrikaans in Cape  Town  and
Bloemfontein. But Free Staters want equal treatment.  So  we  need  to  hear
Sesotho and Setswana here in Cape Town, which should be  equally  available,
because they are the dominant languages in our areas.

More often than not provinces find themselves making difficult choices  when
it comes to deciding which languages to use in schools and  which  ones  not
to use. A case in point was Thembisa High  School  in  Gauteng,  where  they
offered six African languages as first languages, and English and  Afrikaans
as second languages, which was their choice. Educators had their hands  full
trying to calm irate parents who learnt that Tshivenda and South Sotho  were
being phased out. Parents clearly demonstrated that they  attached  a  great
deal of importance to education in the mother tongue.

These real difficulties experienced  by  provinces  should  not  impede  the
promotion of mother tongue usage. Every effort should be made,  through  our
legislative and civil structures, to promote and defend the rights  of  each
individual to use the language of his or her choice.  If  we  undermine  any
language grouping for whatever reason, we will most likely find  a  case  of
dominance versus subordination, where the dominant group would not  hesitate
to exercise power and control over the subordinated group.

We must guard against such scenarios. We have already had  the  painful  and
devastating experience of apartheid with its  enforcement  of  Afrikaans  as
the dominant  language.  All  of  that  led  to  discrimination,  peripheral
imagination, the denial of group rights, and the oppression  of  social  and
cultural development.

In the past we were victims of English throughout our country.  What  a  joy
it is to see and hear on television beautiful South  African  schoolchildren
in mixed choirs singing African songs and even keeping the  rhythm.  How  we
wish to see white children being as fluent in African languages  as  African
children are in television programmes!

When a language exists as an official language, its role to increase  social
development can only be made effective if it forges communicative links  and
shared co-existence between speakers of different languages. Some of  us  in
South Africa face linguistic mistrust because we are  unable  to  understand
each other. In the  worst-case  scenario,  this  leads  to  mistrust,  fear,
hatred, anger and  estrangement,  consequently  widening  the  communication
gap.

Today English does not belong to  the  British  alone.  The  same  goes  for
Afrikaans. There are more people who speak Afrikaans, the  ``tsotsi  taal'',
who do not have Dutch or German ancestry. It is truly  a  joy  to  read  and
speak other languages which are the first  that  a  baby  receives  when  it
comes to this earth. It is a shame to those who still refuse  to  learn  and
speak other people's languages and mother tongues. They really do  not  know
what they are missing.

I remember when we were young, in the ANC Youth League, we used to  sing  in
different languages. In the Youth League we sang in Italian:


  Avanti popolo, alla riscosa
  Bandiera rossa, triomfera.

We did it! It is a pity my brother, Raju, is not here. I sang  in  Urdu  and
Hindi:


  Par naa jhandaa na jhuka naa.

Those are the languages I spoke. They are the languages of  our  people,  of
the people in our country. I sang in Xhosa,  Tshivenda,  Xitsonga,  even  in
Setswana. When one saw a cow coming,  one  would  praise  it:  ``Malonko  wa
marumo se apa le  toutou.  Modimo  nko  metsi  ...''  [Tsenoganong.]  [Cow.]
[Interjections.]]

That is who we are, and we as people  of  South  Africa,  said  it  also  in
Afrikaans:


  Maar een Suid-Afrika


  Gee my 'n roer in my regterhand,
  Gee my 'n bok wat vlug oor die rand -
  En 'n flukse perd om hom weg te dra:
  Gee my Suid-Afrika.
[Gelag.] [Applous.] [Laughter.] [Applause.]


  Gee my 'n vlakte ruim en wyd,
  Gee my my die veld se oneidigheid -
  En die lekker geur wat die lug daar dra:
  Gee my Suid-Afrika.

Ek  kan  nog  aangaan  en  aangaan.  [Applous.]  [I  could  go  on  and  on.
[Applause.]]

We want to see how many of the other people  in  South  Africa  speak  other
languages.  Mother  tongue  is  ``baie  belangrik,  lekker,  mnaa,  sharp!''
[good]! [Interjections.] E monate. [It is enjoyable.]

Today we say thank you to the ANC Government; we say thank you to the  whole
of South Africa. We are much closer to the  each  other  than  we  were  six
years ago. We need to respect and  celebrate  one  other's  mother  tongues,
even those that are not official in South Africa. There  are  the  languages
of God's people, be they Arabic, Hindu, Gujerati, Chinese  or  others.  Some
of us try to meet and get to know people. When  one  travels  all  over  the
world and can say a few phrases in the language of  the  local  people,  one
gets milk, water and bread. If one  just  sticks  to  oneself,  and  remains
alone, one will die alone.

We have a long road to travel to educate our  citizens  who  never  saw  the
need nor showed the inclination or the desire to  learn  African  languages.
If we do not succeed in our endeavours to bring our various language  groups
together, a minority of our children  will  remain  underprivileged  by  not
being able to communicate with their brothers and sisters  in  our  country.

paragraphs follows.)

[Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson and hon members, today is the day for  promoting
mother tongues. When I talk about mother tongue, I  am  referring  to  one's
original language, the language of one's biological mother. This  is  a  day
for showing appreciation and praising language specialists  and  authors  of
ancient novels. As we have said, a mother is the primary care-giver  of  the
child.

When a mother is not there  to  take  good  care  of  a  child,  it  becomes
difficult for the child to adopt the sounds of  speech  of  its  traditional
language. This will have long-lasting effects on the  child's  comprehension
of the language. We have to participate in the  campaign  to  encourage  our
children to learn their mother tongue.

I am forced to speak English so that we can all understand  and  know  where
we are.]

The national agenda of the ANC is to unify all South Africans, and  that  is
also the national agenda of the national Government. When we say we are  the
rainbow nation, we should not play  or  pretend  to  be  that.  We  must  be
exactly what we are supposed to be.

I  want  to  start  by  quoting  from   a   speech   delivered   by   Vigdis
Finnbogadottir,  who  in  1998  was  appointed   United   Nations   Goodwill
Ambassador  for  Languages.  On  the  occasion  of   the   Intergovernmental
Conference on Cultural Policies for  Development  in  Sweden  in  1998,  she
said:


  Everyone loses if one language is lost, because then a nation and culture
  lose their memories, and so does the  complex  tapestry  from  which  the
  world is woven and which makes the world an exciting place.  Every  piece
  of history that we lose leaves a hole in the present.

Having said that, it is estimated that 6 000  spoken  languages  around  the
world today face extinction. This would represent an  irreparable  loss  for
humanity. And, quite frankly, we cannot afford  to  lose  them,  since  they
represent some of humanity's most precious treasures. It  is  therefore  our
duty to contribute to the preservation of the  world's  languages.  History,
and perhaps our  own  history  more  than  anything  else,  has  undoubtedly
demonstrated that suppression and denial  of  mother-tongue  languages  have
abysmal consequences.

When South Africa celebrated its elevation to becoming a member of the  free
world in 1994, the nations of the free world celebrated with  us.  Today  we
reciprocate that nascent kindred spirit in  the  same  vein  on  this  third
anniversary of the International Mother Language  Day,  a  spirit  which  is
shared by more than 200 nations across the globe.

This day came into being through a unanimous proclamation by Unesco  at  its
headquarters in Paris in November 1998. It was  a  resolution  in  terms  of
which Unesco said that the recognition of this day was to bear in mind  that
all moves to promote the dissemination of mother tongues were  not  only  to
encourage linguistic diversity  and  multilingual  education,  but  also  to
develop  a  fuller  awareness  about  linguistic  and  cultural   traditions
throughout the world and  to  inspire  solidarity  based  on  understanding,
tolerance and dialogue. Lest  we  forget,  this  is  essentially  a  day  of
tribute and homage to the intellectuals,  cultural  activists  and  language
martyrs throughout the world.

As a nation, we are also commemorating the celebrating of  our  own  martyrs
who paid the ultimate price on  that  fateful  day  of  16  June  1976.  Hon
members know what it was all about; some were  persecuted  long  after  that
day. It is precisely this universal martyrdom that resonates so clearly  and
so sprightily in the South African spirit today,  a  resonance  filled  with
brilliant records of heroism and  triumph  -  our  presence  here  today  is
testimony to this - a resonance we, however, embrace with a  huge  sense  of
trepidation, since it brings to mind solemn memories.

I am convinced therefore that our purpose in assembling here today,  and  at
gatherings elsewhere in our country, is to pursue and arrive  at  a  destiny
where all recognise, enhance and forge the  partnership  that  is  glaringly
lacking in the  South  African  lexicon.  I  refer  to  the  partnership  to
demonstrate  to  the  world  that  our  plea,   as   South   Africans,   for
reconciliation and nation-building through the  promotion  of  mother-tongue
languages, has never been an idle plea. It is a plea that  is  enshrined  in
our Constitution. Our universal recognition as  a  country  to  support  the
sanctity  of  mother-tongue  language  is  further  esteemed   through   our
endorsement and signing of the numerous universal conventions.

Ke ka moo re reng sedikwa ke ntswapedi ga se thata. Re  tshwanetse  gore  re
kopanye diatla tsa rona gore re tle re kgone le go tlhatlosa moono  wa  puo.
[Legofi.] [United we stand. We have to join hands to promote our  languages.
[Applause.]]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek wil baie dankie sê  aan  al  die
LP's wat deelgeneem het aan hierdie debat. Ek  wil  agb  lede  bedank  omdat
hulle in hul moedertaal gepraat het. Ek hoop dit was die begin, dat  ons  in
meer debatte ons moedertaal sal gebruik, en dat  dit  nie  net  vir  hierdie
okkasie bedoel was nie.

Ons moet egter ook almal begin kla as ons moedertaal te ná gekom word,  maar
ons moet dit met waardigheid en respek vir die ander doen.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairman, I sincerely wish to thank all the MPs  who
took part in this debate. I wish to thank hon members for speaking in  their
mother tongue. I hope that this was the start  and  that  we  will  use  our
mother tongue in more debates and that it was not  only  reserved  for  this
occasion.

We should all start to complain if our mother tongue  is  offended,  but  we
should do it with respect and dignity for others.]

The Chairperson of this House said on one occasion that the NCOP  must  also
be seen as the House that in practice portrays  our  language  diversity.  I
think that is exactly what we are doing today.

I want to thank the hon member from KwaZulu-Natal, Mr Ngidi.  He  is  right!
The SABC should review their policy and provide a balanced  service  to  all
South Africans. We salute the mothers, along with hon Prince Zulu,  for  the
role they play in teaching our children our languages. However, it  is  time
that the mothers, fathers and children take hands and together  promote  and
protect the languages of our forefathers.

Ek wil vir mev Gouws baie dankie sê vir die ode wat sy hier gebring het,  en
haar bedank vir haar bydrae. Ek is net jammer dat nie een van haar  kollegas
hier kon wees om dit wat sy hier vir ons gelewer het, te kon deel en  ervaar
nie. Weer eens, baie dankie daarvoor. [I would like to say  thank  you  very
much to Mrs Gouws, for the ode she recited here and I wish to thank her  for
her contribution. It is just sad that none of her colleagues  were  here  to
share and experience  what  she  contributed  here  today.  Thank  you  once
again.]

I would like to say to Rev  Chabaku  that  the  Free  State  legislature  is
surely an example to this Parliament and the rest of South Africa.

Eerw Chabuka het my egter skaam en nederig laat voel, omdat sy Afrikaans  só
goed ken, en ek nie een van ons inheemse tale naastenby so goed ken  as  wat
sy my moedertaal ken nie. Ek wil haar bedank vir haar inspirasie.  [However,
I felt quite embarrassed and humbled by Rev  Chabuka's  sound  knowledge  of
Afrikaans whilst I do not know one of the  indigenous  languages  nearly  as
good  as  she  knows  my  mother  tongue.  I  wish  to  thank  her  for  her
inspiration.]
Hon Oom Dawie is so right! [Laughter]. We will have to guard  that  not  one
of our languages disappears, because our special  diversity  is  really  the
worthwhile thing that can unify us. Let me conclude.

Ek hoop dat hierdie debat sal voortduur, en ons nie hier sal ophou  nie.  [I
hope that this debate will continue and that we will not stop here.]

I want to conclude by quoting from the Freedom Charter,  as  follows:  ``All
people shall have equal rights.'' [Applause.] I hope hon members will  carry
this enthusiasm in connection with mother-tongue languages through to  their
constituencies.

HON MEMBERS: Yes! [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Because, up  until  now,  hon  members  have  been  very
silent about this. All people shall have  equal  rights  to  use  their  own
languages, and to develop their own folk culture and customs.

The Bill of Rights gives every citizen the right to  use  the  language  and
participate in the cultural life of  his  or  her  choice.  Who  are  we  to
promote only one language? Let us do what is expected  of  us.  Nobody  else
will do it for us and only we can make the difference. The time to make  the
difference is now. Let us do it! [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SERVICES -CONVENTION
                     ON THE NATIONALITY OF MARRIED WOMEN

Dr P J C NEL: Modulasetulo, ke a se tseba Sesotho, ke a  bua,  empa  e  seng
haholo, hanyane feela. [Chairperson, I know Sesotho  and  I  speak  Sesotho,
but not so much, just a little bit.]

Ek is baie jammer dat ek nie my toespraak vandag in Sesotho kan  lewer  nie,
want dit sou my groot plesier verskaf het. [I very  much  regret  not  being
able to make my speech in Sesotho today, because  it  would  have  given  me
great pleasure to do so.]
It is my privilege today to speak on behalf of a specific group  of  married
women in South Africa. Women are the most beautiful creatures on earth  that
God created. Somebody once said something about women, and I quote:


  We men admire them for their courage, we adore them for their beauty  and
  we love them simply for what they are.

In spite of all this, discrimination against women on  the  basis  of  their
sex has been a reality in many spheres of  our  society.  Married  women  in
particular have, over the years, not  always  enjoyed  the  same  protection
with regard to loss and acquisition of nationality as their husbands.

The international Convention on the Nationality of Married  Women,  held  in
New York as long ago as 20  February  1957,  recognised  ``ÿ.ÿ.ÿ.  that,  in
article 15 of  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the  General
Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed that ``everyone  has  a  right  to
nationality and that no one shall be  arbitrarily  deprived  of  nationality
nor denied the right to change his nationality.'' The  convention  aimed  to
address this kind of discrimination on the basis of gender.

The very first article of the  convention  states  that  ``each  contracting
state agrees that  neither  the  celebration  nor  the  dissolution  of  the
marriage between one of its nationals  and  an  alien,  nor  the  change  of
nationality by the husband during marriage, shall automatically  affect  the
nationality of the wife''.

In terms of article 3 of the convention ... ``each contracting state  agrees
that the alien wife of one of its nationals may,  at  her  request,  acquire
the nationality of her husband through specially  privileged  naturalisation
procedures''.

This  convention  was  adopted  to  promote  ``universal  respect  for,  and
observance of,  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  for  all  without
distinction as to sex''. This convention supports the  same  values  as  our
Constitution. The state law advisers indicated that the  provisions  of  the
convention are  not  in  conflict  with  South  Africa's  domestic  law  and
international obligations.

Article 4 of the convention is subject to ratification by both Houses  after
it has been signed by the member state. South Africa has already signed  the
convention, on 29 January 1993, but has not ratified it  yet.  The  National
Assembly has already approved the ratification of the convention.

Therefore, I now request this House  to  approve  the  ratification  of  the
convention in terms of section 231 of the Constitution.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Report adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 16:47.
