                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr N P NHLEKO: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the people of Zimbabwe will be going to the polls on 9 and
       10 March to elect a president for their country;


  (2) calls on -


       (a)  all eligible voters in Zimbabwe to exercise their right to vote;


       (b)  all stakeholders to work tirelessly towards an environment which
           is conducive to free and fair elections; and


       (c)  all parties and stakeholders to accept the outcome of the
           democratic elections and to work together as a people to
           strengthen democracy, economic prosperity and development, and
           to build a stable Zimbabwe.

[Applause.]

Mnr G A J GROBLER: Mev die Speaker, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek sal
voorstel:
  Dat die Huis -


  (1) die DA gelukwens met sy oorwinning in die tussenverkiesing in
       Bothaville in die Vrystaat;


  (2) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die DA gewen het met 60 persent van die stemme, en beide die ANC
           en Vryheidsfront geklop het;


       (b)  die Nuwe NP so min steun in die provinsie het dat hulle nie eens
           'n kandidaat benoem het nie;


       (c)  indien die Vryheidsfront nie eens steun in die Vrystaat geniet
           nie, hulle geen bedreiging vir die DA inhou in die res van Suid-
           Afrika nie; en


       (d)  die ANC se gebrek aan dienslewering gelei het tot 'n weerstand
           onder hulle tradisionele ondersteuners en dat hulle deel van die
           stemtotaal gedaal het van 11,5 persent tot 2,4 persent.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows.)

[Mr G A J GROBLER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the DA on its victory in the by-election in  Bothaville
       in the Free State;


  (2) takes note that -


       (a)  the DA won with 60 percent of the votes, and beat both  the  ANC
           and the Freedom Front;


       (b)  that the New NP has so little support in the province that  they
           did not even nominate a candidate;


       (c)  if the Freedom Front does not even  have  support  in  the  Free
           State, they should be no threat to the DA in the rest  of  South
           Africa; and


       (d)  the ANC's lack of service  delivery  has  led  to  a  resistance
           amongst their traditional supporters and that their share of the
           total votes has dropped from 11,5 percent to 2,4 percent.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) learns with disgust that an SAA  flight  attendant  was  arrested  in
       Lagos after a handful of dagga joints were found in his possession;


  (2) still questions the safety of passengers when security checks  by  x-
       ray and body searches were done and cleared by this attendant;


  (3) is also concerned about other unbecoming behaviour by attendants  who
       drink heavily on flights and  irritate  passengers  by,  inter  alia,
       opening aircraft doors and trying to kiss female passengers;


  (4) appeals to the sense of duty of and respect for passengers' rights by
       the flight crew; and


  (5) calls upon the SAA to take disciplinary measures against employees
       who do not uphold the work ethic.

Mr Z KOTWAL: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Agricultural Business Chamber business confidence
       index shows a rise of confidence in the farming sector of 20%;


  (2) recognises that research findings also show a 12% rise in
       competitiveness of the farming sector from 1999 to 2000 as a result
       of sharper business skills, high quality products and improved
       productivity; and


  (3) congratulates the agricultural sector for adapting successfully to
       participation in the global economy.

[Applause.]

Mr S SIMMONS: Mev die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  170 DP-DA lede te Everton en Sebokeng,  Gauteng,  en  180  DP-DA
           lede te Mitchells Plain, Wes-Kaap, na die Nuwe NP oorgeloop het;


       (b)  dit die begin van die DP-DA se ondergang is;


       (c)  die DP-DA nie 'n party vir alle mense is nie, maar slegs vir wit
           liberale en regses, en daarom al hoe minder steun onder bruin en
           swart gemeenskappe geniet;


       (d)  die DP-DA 'n party is -


           (i)   met 'n diktatoriale leierskap; en


           (ii)  wat diskrimineer teen bruin Suid-Afrikaners soos bewys  is
                  in hulle optrede teenoor mnr Cedric McNiel  van  Worcester
                  en teenoor Peter Marais; en


  (2) 'n beroep doen op die DP-DA leierskap om op te hou  om  raadslede  te
       terroriseer en lastig te val met dokumente wat hulle  moet  teken  as
       bewys van hulle lojaliteit.


(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr S SIMMONS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House –


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  170 DP-DA members in Everton and Sebokeng, Gauteng, and 180  DP-
           DA members in Mitchells Plain, Western Cape, crossed over to the
           New NP;


       (b)  this is the beginning of the downfall of the DP-DA;


       (c)  the DP-DA is not a party for all, but only  for  white  liberals
           and right-wingers  and  is  therefore  enjoying  less  and  less
           support among coloured and black communities; and


       (d)  the DP-DA is a party -


           (i)   with a dictatorial leadership; and


           (ii)  which discriminates against coloured  South  Africans,  as
                 proved by their behaviour towards Messrs Cedric  McNiel  of
                 Worcester and Peter Marais; and


  (2) appeals to the DP-DA leadership to stop terrorising councillors and
       harassing them with documents they must sign as proof of their
       loyalty.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Yes, hon Van der Merwe?

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: [Inaudible.]

An HON MEMBER: Crossfire between these two parties! [Laughter.]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:
  That the House -


  (1) congratulates Pioneer Foods for their pioneering efforts in black
       economic empowerment by selling one of the largest egg-laying and egg-
       packaging stations at Winterton, KwaZulu-Natal, to their employees in
       a contract amounting to R24 million, which has an annual turnover of
       R40 million from the production of 8,8 million dozen eggs;


  (2) welcomes the new ownership of Ukhahlamba Poultry Management whose
       major shareholders and directors come from a pool of former workers
       as well as a trust representing current workers, noting that this is
       the 19th such project being transferred by Pioneer Foods;


  (3) congratulates Pioneer Foods on underwriting the loan for 20 years,
       continuing to support training and technical management, as well as
       purchasing the entire production on a continuous basis; and
  (4) calls on the corporate sector as well as national Government to
       follow suit, thereby empowering workers, creating jobs, alleviating
       poverty and producing food for export and domestic consumption.

Ms B P SONJICA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Durban will host the inaugural summit of the African Union
       later this year;


  (2) further notes that an estimated 6 000 delegates, including  heads  of
       states and governments from more than 50 African states, are expected
       to attend the event;


  (3) believes that journalists from around the world  will  afford  Durban
       invaluable exposure to raise the city's profile as a  convention  and
       tourism destination; and


  (4) welcomes this announcement.

[Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, I will move on the  next  sitting  day  of  the
House:

  That the House, on this International Women's Day -


  (1) notes that one of the central pieces of legislation  assisting  women
       and children is the Maintenance Act;


  (2) consequently commends the Department of Justice on the appointment of
       an additional 80 maintenance prosecutors, to assist in  reducing  the
       workload in the maintenance courts;


  (3) notes with concern that, notwithstanding that the Maintenance Act was
       passed in 1998, certain problems are still being experienced with its
       implementation, particularly regarding the appointment of maintenance
       investigators to assist women in tracing husbands or fathers who
       evade maintenance payments;


  (4) consequently calls upon the Department of Justice to urgently appoint
       investigators, such as sheriffs of the court, on an interim basis to
       assist such women; and


  (5) calls upon the department to take more stringent steps in enforcing
       garnishee orders for the payment of maintenance, by prosecuting
       employees who fail to deduct such maintenance payments from salaries.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, on the next sitting day of the House I shall
move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with regret the disturbances in the schools in the Tsakane-
       Balfour areas;


  (2) deplores the manner in which a situation requiring investigation and
       discussion was badly handled and even referred to the police;


  (3) strongly condemns the manner in which young students in their tender
       years were brutalised, handcuffed and tied with leg-irons, refused
       bail initially and later in some cases granted bail of R200.00 per
       student for the alleged "crime" of organising an illegal gathering;


  (4) further condemns the way a large contingent of police harassed the
       family of the deceased student for days when they should have been
       deployed in areas of crime;


  (5) applauds the courage, determination and patience of these young
       students who, instead of being intimidated and harassed or even
       spiritually crushed, have maintained their democratic right to
       freedom of speech;


  (6) calls on the Department of Education to  probe  and  investigate  the
       allegations made by the students;


  (7) further calls on the police to stop their provocative  harassment  of
       students and their families; and


  (8) appeals to all role-players to co-operate in defusing  the  situation
       and allowing normal schooling to take place.

Mr J H NASH: Madam Speaker, on the next sitting day of  the  House  I  shall
move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the President of the World Conference on Petroleum, Eivald
           Roren, announced that South Africa will host the 18th World
           Conference on Petroleum in 2005; and


       (b)  this event will attract up to 5 000 delegates representing over
           90 countries in the oil, gas and related industries;


  (2) believes that this conference will benefit South Africa, especially
       in tourism and job creation; and


  (3) welcomes the announcement made by president Eivald Roren, as this
       will contribute positively to the Government's programme to fight
       poverty by means of encouraging investments, job creation and
       boosting tourism.

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock the death of a five-year-old girl in KwaMashu and
       the wounding of her grandmother by a man who was being sued for child
       maintenance by the mother of the girl;


  (2) expresses its concern at the vulnerability of women seeking
       maintenance payments from ``deadbeat dads'' who renege on their
       responsibilities;


  (3) calls on the Government to provide greater assistance and protection
       to women claiming child maintenance from fathers; and


  (4) extends its condolences to the family on their loss.

Prof H NGUBANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the current practice of discrimination against women by some
           insurance companies and pension funds that on the assumption
           that they have a longer life expectancy than men, their premiums
           are either loaded or the sums of money available to them at the
           time of maturity are less than those of their male counterparts;


       (b)  that such practices are unconstitutional; and


       (c)  that with the Aids pandemic, younger women are in fact more
           prone to infection and death, and this argues against the
           assumption of longer life expectancy; and


  (2) resolves to take all necessary steps to ensure that all such
       unconstitutional, discriminatory practices be ceased forthwith.

Mr S M RASMENI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes the decision of the United States government not to impose
       tariffs on the importation of South African steel products;


  (2) recognises that the exemption of tariffs was to a large measure due
       to the efforts of the Minister of Trade and Industry, Alec Erwin; and


  (3) welcomes the reprieve for the South African steel industry and
       commends the Government and Minister Erwin for their efforts to
       ensure that the US honours its commitment to our region.

               TELEPHONE INTERPRETING SERVICE FOR SOUTH AFRICA

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Madam Speaker, hon
members, it has been a long and hard road that we have traversed since I
formally inaugurated the Language Plan Task Group, known as Langtag, in
November 1995. Langtag's task was to advise the Minister of Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology on the issue of a national language plan for South
Africa.

In terms of the constitutional principles on language contained in both the
interim constitution and the 1996 Constitution adopted on 8 May 1996, the
goals of language policy can be summarised as follows: to promote national
unity; to entrench democracy, which includes the protection of language
rights; to promote multilingualism; to promote respect for and tolerance of
linguistic and cultural diversity; to further the elaboration and
modernisation of the African languages, which includes South African sign
language; and to promote national economic development.

The consensus arrived at by Langtag was that the National Language Plan
should be an open-ended, enabling framework containing numerous examples
and guidelines for the development of detailed microplans captured in
legislation, where this is appropriate, with built-in flexibility.

As Minister I have accepted this approach to language policy development
and implementation. As a result we have considered language equity;
language development in South Africa; language as an economic resource;
language in education; literacy; language in the Public Service; heritage
languages; sign language; and augmentative and alternative communication.

Alternative and augmentative communication refers to all modes of
communication used by people who have no means of expressing themselves
through speech, even though they are not primarily hearing impaired or
deaf. Heritage languages refer to the African, Asian, European, religious
and sign languages of South Africa that are considered to be heritage
languages.

This is important, especially at the moment, when the African continent is
clearly in the process of undergoing a renaissance in language policy
development, as evidenced by the outcome of the African Languages
Conference in Erithrea in the year 2000. This will underpin further
democratisation in many African states. I would like to assure the house
that we are now on track in implementing policies that have grown out of
the Langtag recommendations. The language policy in government has gone to
Cabinet and has been costed. Very soon the South African Languages Bill
will be before this Parliament.

The statement I am delivering before Parliament this morning creates an
important building block for language institutions in our country. The
Telephone Interpreting Service for South Africa, popularly known as Tissa,
although in its pilot phase, will impact more on public service delivery.
It has the potential to meet all the objectives of our language policy in
commerce, adult education and literacy, the democratisation of our society
through effective communication, and sign language, as well as many areas
of public concern not listed here.

An example will be useful to clarify what we are announcing today. Take an
old rural woman who is alone at home, and whose home is burgled. Being
alone at home, as her sons and daughters are out at work, and her
grandchildren are away at school, she has to catch a minibus taxi on her
own to go to the nearest police station in the nearest town to report the
incident. She finds police officers at the charge office who do not speak
or use her vernacular. Even if they do, they are not trained interpreters,
and so she battles to convey, in the right way, her message and complaint,
and therefore, her case is not properly recorded. It could be the same
woman going into the out-patients department of a district hospital or
clinic, who again finds staff who are not trained to take a full and
effective history in her vernacular.

In both cases, major inefficiencies in the delivery of that particular and
specific public service arise. This is a daily experience and predicament
faced by many of our citizens. These examples illustrate the predicament,
as I have said, introduced by the communication gap, and this gap can only
be bridged by utilising available human resources, and, of course, by
putting modern technology to use.

It gives me great pleasure, therefore, to announce the launch of the
Telephone Interpreting Service for South Africa. Telephone interpreting is
a form of interpreting that uses the telephone as the medium through which
communication is facilitated. We aim to provide a language solution for
situations where there might be a communication barrier because of
language. To illustrate how Tissa will work, let us go back to these
examples. What would happen is that the police officer would use a
telephone, and first press a dial pin to connect to the Tissa call centre
that will be based in Bloemfontein for this pilot stage. He would then
indicate to the operator what language is needed, whereupon the call centre
operator will contact a trained vernacular-speaking interpreter, who could
be anywhere in the country, and connect the interpreter to the police
officer and the woman in the Free State, as in this example.

Discrepancies in interpreting do have adverse consequences for all
concerned. The use of Tissa will also mean that the efficiency of all
workers will be increased because they will not have to be interrupted at
their jobs. The Tissa project will clearly offer numerous advantages
through the facilitation of communication and improved customer service,
which are of paramount importance in meeting this Government's Batho Pele
objective, that of putting people first.

Tissa is, in our view, a very cost-effective way of managing the language
diversity of South Africa. Although telephone interpreting is a first for
South Africa, it is not a new concept. It is being used successfully in
Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and several
European countries, where it is particularly aimed at facilitating language
barriers that immigrants to these countries experience. I wish to point out
that our Tissa project will, however, focus on the 11 official languages,
and not on foreign languages at this stage.

The Tissa project is just one of the steps that Government is taking to
accelerate transformation and provision of equal access to public services
in our country. This is in line with our principles of addressing
discrimination, establishing democratic values and protecting our
linguistic diversity by giving concrete effect to multilingualism.

I believe that good governance also means devising strategies to ensure
that all the people in our multilingual country will benefit equitably from
the resources that we, as Government, manage on their behalf. Language
resources are arguably not the least important of these resources. Tissa is
an easy system to use and offers an immediate solution for language
problems. I believe that this project is a clear demonstration of how
multilingualism can work in our country. As our Constitution recognises 11
languages, there has to be concrete expression of that commitment.

We shall be formally launching this project at the Katlehong Police Station
next week, and I do hope that South Africans will appreciate this
innovation. I would like to appeal that people who are conversant in
English and Afrikaans should not use this service, because we have a
limited budget of about R3 600 000 at present. This money is to pay for the
phone calls. We have estimated about four phone calls per language on any
particular day. Until we roll it out completely, we will have to be
economical in using this service. I know that there are people who would
want to affirm their self-dignity and their right to language of their
choice by insisting on speaking their vernacular, but, in this case, I say:
Wait a bit so that those who really and genuinely cannot speak other
languages, such as English and Afrikaans, can be the users of this service.
[Applause.]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Madam Speaker and hon Minister, the very act of using or
accommodating someone's language preference shows recognition and affirms
the people with whom one interacts.

The Telephone Interpreting Service for South Africa is an innovative way to
promote multilingualism. We in the DA wish to commend the Minister, the
National Language Service of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology, the Pan-South African Language Board and the Unit for Language
Facilitation and Empowerment of the University of the Free State, which
will manage this pilot project from March to December 2002.

The operators will be customer-friendly, professionally trained and will
adhere to a strict code of conduct. All conversations will be kept strictly
confidential.

We believe that a multilingual service is a  shared  responsibility  and  an
expression of sensitivity to the linguistic needs of communities. All of  us
in our beautiful country need to become more receptive and conscious of  the
language preference of people. In doing so,  it  will  help  to  break  down
barriers and build bridges across the  racial  divide  in  order  to  foster
nation-building.

The Telephone Interpreting Service for South Africa is a very exciting
initiative, and we wish all those involved well and hope that the pilot
project that will target 60 sites across the country in partnership with
the Departments of Health, Labour, Agriculture and Land Affairs and the SA
Police Service will expand to many more sites that will eventually lead to
practical benefits for all South Africans. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the IFP, I wish to congratulate
the Minister on the announcement of Tissa. As we see it, this is one small
step in a very important journey, namely, the use of all 11 languages in
our country.

I try to remember that the number ``eleven'' has the letter ``L'' when
written out, and so does the word ``languages''. So, that is the number of
languages we have, and for any country that has 11 official languages there
is, indeed, the very complex question of how to ensure that all language
users get a fair opportunity to use the language of their choice. Tissa,
though still in its trial stage, is but one short step in that direction,
where we transform the environment of multilingualism in our country.

To the great credit of the people of South Africa, many South Africans are
multilingual and are endeavouring, in fact, to become even more
multilingual. But the fact remains that in many rural areas, where
opportunities for exposure to other languages is limited, people find it
difficult to communicate with the people who are generally professionals
and who, though highly educated, cannot speak to them in their mother
tongue when they come to seek assistance.

This is where Tissa becomes important, so that no one who is stranded,
desperate and seeking genuine assistance will be denied this because
someone on the other side of the telephone cannot understand what he or she
is saying. Here, for the first time, without any cost to the caller - and
this is something to be stressed - such a person will be able to obtain
assistance and someone else will interpret for him or her. Therefore, at
the moment when there is some sort of a crisis, the message will be
conveyed.

The fact that the department at the moment is ensuring that Health, Labour,
Land Affairs and the SAPS will be the first to have such a service
indicates that these are the major areas where people would require
assistance in being understood. If someone who, for example, has a labour
dispute, or someone, in respect of Land Affairs, has a dispute that needs
speedy resolution, lack of communication can exacerbate the problem. This
is where Tissa, by ensuring that the gap is bridged, will enable people to
communicate. And the better the levels of communication and understanding,
the greater the chance that South Africa's democracy will grow from
strength to strength, because we will not falter on that most important
point, which is communication.

So, though we have 11 languages, and though many people in the world
believe that having 11 languages is an ideal that cannot be met, the fact
that we are employing technology slowly to create these bridges and to
allow for mother tongues to continue to be used, is an excellent start and
something for which this House and this country need to congratulate the
Government and the Ministry. I say well done to Minister Ben Ngubane.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, may I take this opportunity, before
I call upon the next speaker to address the House, to recognise two members
of parliament from the Islamic Republic of Iran, who are in the gallery.
You are welcome, hon members. [Applause.]

Mev A VAN WYK: Mevrou die Speaker, gister by die Gender Advocacy
konferensie wat tans in Seepunt gehou word, om saam te val met
Internasionale Vrouedag, was daar vroue uit alle sfere van die samelewing.
Baie sake is aangeroer, maar een wat my veral getref het, is die geweldige
rol wat taal speel om mense in staat te stel om 'n taak uit te voer, om
hulle te handhaaf in die samelewing en om hul behoeftes te vervul, ook hoe
mense voel oor taal.

Verskillende sprekers het hulle daaroor uitgespreek, maar die onuitgesproke
wanhoop by een oor die besluit in die nasleep van 1976, naamlik om miljoene
mense van Afrikaans af te sny, bly my by. Soos sy vandag swaarkry omdat ons
eie moderne Afrikataal vir haar 'n geslote boek bly, kry seker nege uit
tien Afrikaanssprekers vandag swaar omdat ons nie al jare gelede die naaste
swart taal aangeleer het nie. Dit maak jou stom. Dit maak jou doof.

Daarom wil ek vir Minister Ngubane vandag gelukwens met die instel van
Tissa, en hom baie sukses toewens met die inwerkingstelling daarvan. Dit is
'n broodnodige praktiese maatreël waarop die land al lank wag. Dit is dié
soort optrede wat gevolg gee aan beleid. As die daad by die woord gevoeg
word, word diens gelewer. Tissa sal hopelik in die nabye toekoms, so gou
die tandekrystadiumverby is, landwyd suksesvol en volhoubaar ingestel word.

Op daardie dag sal die Nuwe NP hoera sê, en daarmee saam 'n baie groot  deel
van hierdie land se bevolking, want  dit  is  'n  fiksie  dat  genoeg  mense
Engels kan begryp, en dat as die Regering en die sakesektor net lank  genoeg
daarmee aanhou, almal dit naderhand sal aanvaar.  Ek  het  nuus  vir  hulle:
miskenning van die tale van die Bavenda,  die  Basotho,  die  Batswana,  die
Bapedi,  die  amaZulu  en  al  die  ander  word  toenemend  verwerp   namate
bewustheid van eie identiteit en kultuurtrots toeneem. Ten regte ook.
Met bemagtiging deur taal kan die Minister ook nie suinig wees nie, dus
behoort daar genoeg geld hiervoor beskikbaar te wees. 'n Mens hoor dikwels
die argument dat tolk- en vertaaldienste, die ontwikkeling van vaktaal, die
samestelling van woordeboeke, die lewering van moedertaalteksboeke,
gevorderde onderrig en dies meer, te duur is, maar die belange van die
mense kan nie weens ander voorkeure van die owerhede en die sakesektor die
onderspit delf nie.

Dus wens ek die Minister baie sukses toe, en ek hoop dat sy bekendstelling
die weg aandui. Ek hoop sy voorbeeld trek vêr. Alle sukses aan Tissa.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, last night at the Gender Advocacy
Conference, which is currently being held in Sea Point to coincide with
International Women's Day, there were women from all spheres of society.
Many matters were touched upon, but one which hit me particularly was the
huge role which language played in enabling people to carry out a task, to
hold their own in society and to fulfill their needs, as well as how people
feel about language.

Different speakers expressed themselves about that, but the unexpressed
despair of one about the decision in the aftermath of 1976, namely to cut
off millions of people from Afrikaans, remains with me. As she is
struggling today because our own modern African language remains a closed
book to her, approximately nine out of ten Afrikaans speakers are
struggling today because we did not learn the closest black language all
those years ago. It makes one mute. It makes one deaf.
It is for this reason I wish to congratulate Minister Ngubane today on the
establishment of Tissa, and to wish him success with the putting into
operation thereof. It is an essential practical measure on which this
country has been waiting a long time. It is this kind of action which gives
effect to policy. If words are put to action, services are delivered.
Hopefully, in the nearby future, as soon as the teething stage is past,
Tissa will be implemented successfully and sustainably across the country.

On that day the New NP would say hurrah, and together with them a great
many of this country's population, because it is fiction that enough people
can understand English and that if the Government and the business sector
continue to use it long enough everyone will accept it eventually. I have
news for them: disregard for the languages of the Bavenda, the Basotho, the
Batswana, the Bapedi, the amaZulu and all the others are being rejected
increasingly as awareness of own identity and cultural pride increases. And
rightly so.

With empowerment through language the Minister also cannot be stingy,
therefore enough money should be available for this. One often hears the
argument that interpreting and translation services, the development of
subject language, the compilation of dictionaries, the production of mother-
tongue textbooks, specialised education, and so on are too expensive, but
the interest of the people cannot be defeated as a result of other
preferences of the authorities and the business sector.

I therefore wish the Minister every success and I hope that his
introduction will show the way. I hope his example reaches far. Every
success to Tissa. [Applause.]]

Ms A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, participating in this debate is a pleasure.
The UDM would like to congratulate the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science
and Technology and the National Language Service on having a solid,
practical and implementable programme that will change the lives of many.

Tissa is an example of a practical action that embodies language rights and
contributes greatly to the extension and implementation of human rights. It
brings to life a right that would otherwise just remain words on paper.

The importance of and need for Tissa might escape many members of the House
since they experience communicating in their own language as a given and
never give it a second thought, but one just needs to imagine how difficult
it is to explain one's symptoms to one's doctor in one's own language. Now,
imagine how this scenario becomes worse when one has to do it in a language
that is not one's home language to a doctor who is communicating with one
in a language which is not his home language, but one that both of you hope
the other will understand.

Victims of crime, who are already traumatised, often find themselves in
situations where they have to make a statement in a language other than her
or his home language. Vital information gets lost in the process, and this
can negatively influence the investigation. The establishment of Tissa will
eliminate the loss of information.

While not detracting from the merits of Tissa, the UDM would like to
enquire from the Minister whether research was done to determine the legal
position of Tissa should one of the parties using Tissa argue that the
translation was not accurate. Mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure
that the substance of a message does not get lost, even if this means
recording the calls.

The UDM again congratulates the Minister and the department on a process
which acts out a basic principle of our human rights.

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, the concept of a telephone
interpreting service for South Africa - operating countrywide and providing
a 24-hour, seven-day week service, which is the stated goal - sounds like a
tall order considering that parliamentarians cannot even get one or two
interpretations two or three times a week in Parliament, where interpreters
could access written speeches beforehand if they wanted to.

It would, however, be awesome if this were to be a reality, and the ACDP
commends Government on taking the initiative in this project, which offers
hope to many frustrated citizens, tourists and immigrants of all language
groups who battle to receive the service they require. It also has the
potential to facilitate more equitable service delivery.

Would not this sort of venture, however, be more feasible in terms of
quality, sustainability and job creation, if it were a privately owned,
profit-driven company through which Government could access and even
subsidise services in certain areas?

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the PAC supports this progressive move, which
we believe will help the people of South Africa to be more united.

Apartheid divided our nation. We are hardly a nation, but disjointed
fragments. The only time we are a semblance of a nation is when we watch
Bafana Bafana or when the rugby team is winning.

Many people do not know what they are missing by not knowing other South
African languages. We need to promote knowledge of at least four South
African languages per person. Many black South Africans already qualify. We
must encourage others to get down to learning. We need to promote knowledge
of at least Portuguese, French and English in South Africa.

Our languages are rich, not superior or inferior. The only person who is
inferior is one who knows only one language, his language. Tissa is a step
in the right direction.

Molo mhlobo wethu! Dumelang bagesu! [We greet you, friend! Hello, my
countrymen!] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, being a rainbow nation and a great magnet
for tourism, we are often faced with the predicament of language
differences and boundaries that hinder or rather cause a breakdown in
communication.

The MF realises the seriousness of this problem, and thereby welcomes the
Tissa project. Having their target on police stations, hospitals and
clinics, the service will certainly ensure the wellbeing of and proper
communication between persons of different languages.
The reasons for employing the Telephone Interpretation Service for South
Africa are numerable and the MF is in favour of this project, which will
assist in the development of language and human rights. Doctors will be
able to attend to patients with a better understanding, and the same will
apply at clinics and police stations.

The MF recognises Tissa as a necessity and supports the programme, and
congratulates the Minister on his initiative. Siyabonga! [Thank you!]
[Applause.]

Prof I J MOHAMED: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the ANC I welcome the
statement by Minister Dr Ngubane on the trial programme of the Telephone
Interpretation Service for South Africa, Tissa.

The National Language Service of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science
and Technology has researched the idea of telephone interpreting between
parties who do not understand, or do not adequately understand, one other's
languages. The parties are linked up in a setting similar to a telephone
conference network via a skilled interpreter who can communicate with
either party using sophisticated equipment. The parties could, on the one
hand, be a set of court officials and, on the other, a witness in a trial
or a doctor interviewing a patient who describes his or her problem, as the
Minister has already indicated. Equally, it could be a citizen asking
information from a state official who speaks another language. This will be
our setting to begin with.

There are problems, of course, as was found abroad. For example, the
interpreter may prompt, edit or give information in a different order, use
indirect language like ``he says'' or be unable to convey what is peculiar
to a particular culture in which the language is set. Interviews may take
two to three minutes longer than normal.

There are three points I would like to stress. Firstly, the system embodies
language liberalisation and minimises the marginalisation by language, and
is therefore welcomed. I think this point has been made by many people. But
to be really effective, this would have to be extended on a broad basis and
the technology needs to be greatly improved.

Secondly, with the centralisation of interpreting services, highly skilled
interpreters would be required. Indeed, they would have to acquire
specialised knowledge of various fields. This is likely to lead to job
losses of the less highly trained interpreters, particularly in the remote
areas. This would make the work of interpreters more stressful than it
already is.

Thirdly, with more and more skilled interpretation services becoming
available, the need for becoming multilingual becomes less pressing, while
it must be our goal in South Africa, for very obvious reasons.

In my youth I tried to learn three or four languages in order to read
research papers in my particular area, but when skilled services were set
up and all the journals were translated, the need from my side fell away.
None of the above, of course, weighs heavily against the present
initiative, which is, therefore, very welcome. I believe - although many
linguists do not - that we are at the beginning of a major technological
advance in the not too very distant future. For example, the aim is
ultimately to have machine translations. The problems, of course, are
formidable.

Today attempts are made to communicate with possibly intelligent
inhabitants of remote planets with unknown systems of communicating amongst
themselves. Clearer methods used are mathematical, which deal with
infinitely complex systems. Language is something like that also. It is a
domain with fairly complex things like grammar, vocabulary, idiomatic
expressions and so on, and another language will have its own.
Interpretation, of course, is a mapping from one domain to another one and
this is precisely the area that mathematics deals with.

Clearly the methods used are based on mathematics with infinitely complex
systems. But I believe that problem will be solved, although, as I said,
the logicians or linguists do not think that will happen for a very long
time to come. But, as I say, work is already being done. So we congratulate
the Minister, because I believe this is the beginning of going in that
direction. What I am suggesting may take quite some time. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

             WOMEN'S RIGHTS: AN IMPORTANT PILLAR OF HUMAN RIGHTS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Madam Speaker,
members of this House, as we come together in celebration either on 8
March, International Women's Day, or on 9 August, I think to many of us the
rallying song Malibongwe comes to mind. And it is a bit sad today that I do
not hear the song resonating through this House, where no one is trying to
sing this particular song.

Unfortunately, unlike the Deputy Speaker, when there was a queue for
talents and the singing talent was handed out, I was informed reliably that
I broke both my legs. [Laughter.] So I cannot even try to lead in song at
this point, but I do want to say that for us all, the whole rallying
message comes to the fore.

I think also that as we gather here today to celebrate 8 March, as this
august House, we also see this as a day of international and national
solidarity, because this day is indeed internationally celebrated precisely
because women engage in a common struggle against inequalities of all
sorts. Women are united in the struggle to ensure that women's rights are
human rights and that, I think, is still a matter that unites women
globally as we are joined in international solidarity.

I believe that, even if we need to do so fleetingly, we need to think about
women of the world elsewhere on the globe who are in situations of
conflict. We should take this moment also to extend our solidarity and
camaraderie to women who are in difficult situations. Today, it would not
be misplaced to think of the women of the Middle East. It would also not be
misplaced to think of the women of Palestine, in particular. I think that,
as South African people, particularly women, we should at this particular
moment also join the women of the world who will be gathering in New York
on 4 to 15 March for the 46th session of the Commission on the Status of
Women.

They are going to focus, essentially, on two major thematic issues. They
are going to focus on two themes from the Beijing Declaration Platform for
Action, re-endorsed in Beijing +5, that will look at eradicating poverty,
including the empowering of women throughout their life cycle in a
globalising world. They will also look at environmental management and the
mitigation of natural disasters, from an agenda perspective.

However, as part of this focus, which very clearly underpins human rights
of women, they have been given the responsibility, by the Economic and
Social Council of the UN, to focus on the situation of the Palestinian
women. They have to continue to monitor and take action with regard to the
Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies, particularly paragraph 260, which looks
at the situation of Palestinian women and children.

I raise this here today, because some of our colleagues will remember and
others would wish not to remember that Nairobi took place in 1985. There
are some women in this House who were part of the 1985 UN Women's
Conference, and the situation of the Palestinian women and children have
not gotten better, but worse. Hence we need to think of that today.

We are also looking, in New York, at those clauses in the Beijing
Declaration Platform for Action and the 23rd Special Session of the General
Assembly. Let the South African people also look at this particular matter
because we, after all, hosted a very important World Conference Against
Racism and other forms of Racial Discrimination, and in that there was a
special focus on the Middle East. In terms of this particular issue, it is
about women's rights being human rights.

We cannot deal with any of these matters without looking at it more
broadly. I think, at this point, in order to make a bridge between South
African women and women of the world who are in situations of conflict, I
would like to take us back to the words of a Women's Day song. The words go
thus:


  Remember all our women in the jails,
  remember all our women in campaigns,
  remember all our women over many fighting years,
  remember all our women for their triumphs and their tears.

I think these words can almost be used universally, because we should
remember the women in other parts of the globe in these situations.

The meeting at the UN is also going to note a report of the Secretary-
General of the UN that looks at discrimination against women and girls in
Afghanistan. They will study this report, reflecting on the recent past of
women, as well as the socioeconomic and the human rights of women and
girls. They will look at developments after 11 September 2001 in that
specific situation, relief and reconstruction as well as the role of women
at this point in time, ensuring that they claim their rights.

I think we should again remember that this is a day of international
solidarity for women the world over. Let us look at some of the specific
issues broadly, because we want to link them nationally where we would look
a bit more closely at the aspect of women and poverty. At the conference of
an expert group that met in New Delhi in November 2001, Ms Angela King, the
Assistant Secretary-General and special adviser to the secretary-general on
gender issues and advancement of women said:


  Although the 20th century had raised and seen notable progress in
  advancing human development in some areas as it relates to women, there
  are still difficulties in terms of the scope and depths of human
  deprivation, and this remains significant.

She said that eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development
could not be separated from achieving gender equality and the empowerment
of women. In her view, globalisation offered many opportunities for
transforming the values of society towards the promotion of gender
equality. We need to take this into account as we deal with it, and that
particular report that has been presented now also talks about the role of
women and their representation in various structures.

Let us look at this august House today. Let us say: did we facilitate, as a
country, the representation of women that reflects our women from rural and
poor communities? Are their voices heard here? I want to say today that if
we go back to those women who were engaged in the struggle over the years,
if we look around us, we find that those women are today representing the
women of our country.

We have MaNjobe sitting across me in this room, we have MaGcina over there,
MaNdzanga on the far side there, Ma Maureen Madumisa, Ma Fatima Hajaig
here, Ela Ghandi and Bertha Gxowa. We also have Judy Chalmers and various
others. This House does ensure the voice and representation of women, women
who were never represented in the past. If one looks at the march and the
discussion at the UN, South Africa can say with pride that the voices are
heard, because the women here are still in the trenches. They are not out
of the trenches. [Applause.]

We will still extend our voices to extend the solidarity of women and all
of us younger ones will march under the leadership of those voices.
[Applause.]

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Madam Speaker, International Women's Day is a special
day when women celebrate the struggles and victories of women the world
over. Historically, this day can be traced back to the late 1800s to the
struggle of socialist women in America who were fighting for the right to
vote.
At the same time, round about 1859, women workers at a factory in America
were locked in at night so that they could not go home and had to work
through the night. These women were burned to death in that factory.

Twenty years later, women were continuing to work under those horrible
conditions in New York and other cities in America. Women then mobilised
themselves around 1879 to protest against these horrible working
conditions. Since then, women in America and Europe have begun to mobilise
and fight for their rights and to fight for the vote, and have recognised
this day, 8 March, as International Women's Day in memory of those women
workers who died in the factory in New York.

Around 1910 women in Denmark decided to celebrate International Women's Day
for the first time in Europe, and also mobilised other countries on that
continent to do the same. Subsequently, 8 March has been celebrated in many
countries in Europe and North America to commemorate the struggles of
women.
Historically, this day is of great significance to us in South Africa. It
was around this time that women suffragettes were fighting for the vote in
Europe and North America, and that African women were beginning to organise
and mobilise themselves to fight against the passes that were being
introduced to African women in this country. They were also organising to
fight against the local conditions under which they were living in their
own areas. For instance, they were organising marches to the mayor and the
prime minister, and they fought against the discriminatory laws that were
subjugating Africans in their motherland.

At this time African women were organising - around 1908 and 1913. They
mobilised themselves into an organisation called the Bantu Women's League
from around 1902 until 1913. The Bantu Women's League was the predecessor
of the ANC Women's League.

It is significant that as early as 1902 Charlotte Maxeke was one of three
delegates sent from the Transvaal to participate in the South African
Native National Convention Conference which was held in the Cape. Despite
the fact that she performed very well, women were still not accepted as
full members in the ANC and no vote in the congress.

The Bantu Women's League played a leading role under Charlotte Maxeke's
leadership in mobilising women to protest and reject the introduction of
passes to African women, as well as to coloured women in the Free State.
They also protested against the working conditions of women farmworkers,
especially in the Transvaal.

The league also mobilised women to join political organisations and the
trade union movement. In 1942 the ANC acknowledged the important role that
women played in the struggle and resolved to recognise women as full
members with the right to vote.

In 1943 the ANC Women's League was officially launched as a full branch or
sector of the ANC, and women were mobilised under the league in great
numbers to join the political campaigns, the trade union movements in the
1940s and the 1950s, and the defiance campaigns in the 1950s. It is
significant that African women throughout the continent were involved in
the struggle for liberation, and challenged the political and social
conditions they were subjected to by the colonial rulers of the time.

Through unity in action women formed a strong women's movement, which
resulted in the Federation of South African Women that was launched in
1954. I wish to take this opportunity to salute these women pioneers who
paved the way for the formation of the women's movement in South Africa and
internationally, through their dedication, commitment and sacrifices. I pay
special tribute to Charlotte Maxeke, Ida Mtwana, Lilian Ngoyi, Helen
Joseph, Dorothy Nyembe, Florence Matomela, Dorothy Zihlangu, Ray Alexander,
Rahima Moosa, Mrs Madinoge, Frances Baard and many others who paved the way
for our liberation. [Applause.]

We also pay tribute to women internationally who have been part of this
great movement and the struggle for women's rights. In particular, we would
like to remember Jammila Boupachas of Algeria, Angela Davies of the US,
Ruth Neto of Angola, Mrs Olaf Palmer, and Graça Machel for the outstanding
work she has done with regard to African children.

The theme of our debate today is ``Women's rights - an important pillar for
women's rights''. I believe that by human rights we are referring to the
rights of every person to justice and freedom. I believe that women
comprise more than 50% of the population of our country and of many other
countries the world over.

We know that women, particularly in our country, have suffered multiple
forms of oppression, including oppression and discrimination as workers; at
home as wives, mothers, sisters, daughters; discrimination in society as
blacks; and political and social discrimination. We also suffer religious-
based discrimination and oppression. Addressing these forms of oppression
against women, I believe, will go a long way towards attaining human rights
for all in our country.
I believe that the South African Government has gone a long way towards
addressing women's rights. In this country we have one of the most
progressive constitutions in the world today and a Bill of Rights that has
the equality clause that guarantees the rights of women. And I believe this
is so because women fought for these rights. Women were there during the
talks and during the constitution-making process of this country, to make
their demands.

Furthermore, since 1994, our Government has passed progressive laws that
have incorporated gender and women's concerns. We also have special laws
whose objective was to accelerate transformation and gender equality, such
as the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act; the Maintenance Act; the
Domestic Violence Act, the Customary Marriages Act and many others. These
laws have further entrenched women's rights in our country and moved us
further towards the total emancipation of women.

In ensuring women's participation in politics and decision-making, the ANC-
led Government leads. We now have 30% women representation in this
Parliament, and that is because of the ANC quota and their policy of
affirmative action in respect of women. [Applause.] We also have 3313
representation of women in the Cabinet, and we are number one in Africa and
number seven in the world. We are only surpassed by the Norwegian and
Scandinavian countries. I want to warn them that we are fast catching up,
and perhaps in the next election we will catch up with them.

We have a number of challenges facing us. HIV/Aids, poverty, violence and
the abuse of women and children are still the major challenges facing us.
We have to ensure - and urge our Government to accelerate - the
implementation of the policies that have been passed, that we believe will
address these concerns.

I also want to urge our Government to continue with the education programme
on HIV/Aids mother-to-child transmission, and also to prioritise assistance
to victims of rape, especially in relation to HIV/Aids infection.
Before I sit down, I want us to remember those women who continue to live
in violent and conflict situations. Let us remember women in Zimbabwe,
Angola, the DRC, Sudan, Palestine, Afghanistan and Israel. We know that the
majority of women in these countries, despite the hatred and the wars that
continue to rage in their countries, are committed to peace, justice and
development. We urge our Government to support those countries in fighting
and working towards peace. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! As the hon Sono comes to the podium, I would
like to recognise the honourable women from Palestine who are in the
gallery. [Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Madam Speaker and hon members, the theme of this debate could
not have come at a better time. I believe this debate sets the tone for the
adoption of the draft protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples'
Rights, and the Rights of Women in Africa by the member states at the 2002
African Union Summit in South Africa.

Freedom of expression, political association, pluralism and the dignity of
women are not well understood or respected by many African leaders, both
black and white. I believe that black Africa will progress and move towards
full democracy when our leaders begin to favour openness and eschew
everything that operates as a constraint on the free exercise of our civil
liberties.

As a black South African woman who has experienced the evil system of
apartheid, I believe that oppression must be exposed wherever it occurs,
even in our own backyard. Freedom is not defined only in terms of colour.
If it is wrong for whites to oppress blacks, then it is even more immoral
and shameful for black African leaders to oppress their own people.

I am concerned that despite the ratification of the African Charter of
Human and Peoples' Rights and other international human rights instruments
by the majority of member states, and their solemn commitment to eliminate
all forms of discrimination against women, women in Africa still continue
to be victims of war, land rights and displacements, all because of
defective political systems. Problems persist in black Africa, not so much
because of intellectual inferiority, but because of the application of the
wrong remedies or policies by black African leaders. But of far more
immediate consequence is the question: How can the African people lift
themselves out of poverty, and through what institutions?

South Africa has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world.
Our Constitution includes socioeconomic and political rights. It also
provides for the judicial enforcement of those rights, but women remain
disempowered and for many access to justice remains out of reach.

Regrettably, this Government is failing the women of this country on the
biggest challenges of our times, which are providing security; the rape of
babies and women, which has escalated to horrific levels despite the Rolls
Royce legislation in place; combating of HIV/Aids, creating opportunities
and building prosperity.
According to Statistics South Africa, women and children constitute
approximately 55% of the population, but the irony is that this fact has
failed to inform domestic policy. Many women are still denied access to
land in order to produce household food security for their families in
rural areas, owing to antiquated customary thinking. For instance, the
national Budget, which outlines the Government's financial and economic
objectives through the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, or MTBPS, shows
that the share of health, education and welfare is decreasing as a
proportion of the total Budget. In a nutshell, there is no spending on
social services. Where will the money for higher amounts of child support
grants come from? Where is the money for the new basic income grant?
Government says it will give R1,5 billion for poverty alleviation in 2002.
The target groups will be women and children. The money will be used for
housing, social activities for people who have lost their jobs and local
economic development plans. These issues were agreed to at the 1998 Job
Summit, but research shows that there has been underspending on poverty.
The laxity in implementing Budget estimates and corruption is endemic
throughout all national departments. Who suffers? Women, of course. The
President calls for fiscal austerity and in the same breath makes an appeal
to the nation's emotions to rise up in the spirit of Vukuzenzele. With a
GDP growth prediction of 2%, exactly who is failing who?

The gender machinery is underfunded. Gender analyses since the Budget
Reviews of 1998 through 2000 and the national expenditure review of 1999
through 2000, have all but disappeared. A question that we as women members
of Parliament need to ask the Minister of Finance is: Is he taking money
back from women and children and spending it on submarines and weapons?

Needless to say, life is a quest for good and noble things. We strive to
improve our lives in various ways. But importantly, we want jobs, decent
homes, access to land, food for our families, education for our children,
security from criminals and the freedom to pursue happiness and prosperity
without interference from the state.

I had an opportunity to attend a press conference called by Women for Peace
before the Inter-Congolese Dialogue. Three million people have been
displaced in the Great Lakes region. Ninety percent of the 3 million are
dead and these are women and children. Yet, we sit here and do not even
question domestic systems that are being introduced in Parliament.
[Interjections.][Applause.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Madam Speaker and hon members of this House, I must take
this opportunity to thank members for this opportunity to contribute
towards the discussion on gender equality and human rights. It is quite a
liberating experience.

The IFP believes that human rights are a non-negotiable or an absolute on
any government's agenda. Good governance fundamentally underpins poverty
reduction and this, of course, has a direct relationship with human rights.
Good governance creates the environment in which civil and political rights
are respected and promoted. We believe that the protection of human rights
is too important for symbolic gestures alone. It is through the pursuit of
effective efforts that we begin to promote human rights and show our real
commitment. This is what the South African Government has to deliver to the
women of this country.

One of the world's first organised movements on behalf of women was
inaugurated in 1848, in a small chapel in the sleepy village of Seneca
Falls, New York. There, 32-year-old Elizabeth Cody Stanton delivered what
she described as her first public address, driven by the conviction that
``for women's wrongs to be laid before the public, the woman herself must
do this work'', for woman alone can understand the height, the depth, the
length, the breadth of her degradation.

Stanton's statement was no exaggeration at the time. Women in the United
States at that time were barred from attending all but a few institutions
of higher education. They were barred from voting in elections, barred from
participating in legislative bodies, barred from serving as jurors and so
on. They lived under a double standard that flexed a high degree of sexual
freedom for men and none for women. The ensuing campaign for women's
rights, waged by Elizabeth Stanton, met with belligerence, hostility and
ridicule from politicians and journalists.

Now, with regard to the South African scenario, women have played a pivotal
role in the liberation of this country and the hon the Minister did a good
job in documenting that. So the question I pose to this honourable House
and myself is: Since those days in 1848 in that sleepy village, has gender
justice permeated through to every woman in South Africa, right down to
grass-roots level?

There is no doubt - and many of the speakers have said this - that we have
one of the most advanced or progressive constitutions in the world. This is
acknowledged throughout the world, mainly through the Bill of Rights. It
affords protection against unfair discrimination on the basis of sex,
gender, pregnancy and marital status, to mention but a few. Other sections
of the Constitution further serve to protect the rights of women. For
instance, we have the right to dignity and privacy. Can these rights be
reconciled with rape and violence against women? A resounding no!

Of course, the best of constitutions, the fairest of  electoral  systems  by
themselves assure nothing if people do not have the capability to  use  them
effectively. Democracy does not begin and end with an  election.  Therefore,
no matter how significant the  institutions,  legal  instruments  or  policy
documents are, we need paper rights to become  living  rights;  rights  that
begin to have meaning, not  quasi-academic  or  legal  jargon;  rights  that
begin to empower, educate and encourage women;  and  rights  that  begin  to
instil inclusion and engagement. Right must be able to make practicable  the
notion that women are not inferior beings or second class citizens.

Multiple male chauvinism still abounds in this country. The male version
rears its head in all communities and societies through rape, incest,
genital mutilation and sexual harassment. These human rights violations are
a tragic indictment on any government. We have to understand that the
person who is the supporter of human rights is not only supporting his or
her own human rights, but those of others. They need to become human rights
activists.

We are striving for a situation where men and women are equal partners,
where we need to reach a stage where we no longer need to cater for a
specific gender. We need to reach a stage where there are no vestiges of
inequality or violations of human rights. Moreover, the male-ordered
hierarchical system places men up and women down, minds up or bodies down.
For example, when a man commits a crime the norm is to fault his mind,
whereas with the woman her body is to blame.

So rights are not simply unfettered freedoms, but include responsibilities
and obligations. Rights have to be translated into indigenous languages,
making it almost obligatory that every department, every office where the
public interface, spells out these rights. However, we have to go further
than rhetoric; we have to go further than public statements and conference
resolutions. We need to affirm human dignity. When a man begins to fight
for the dignity of a woman and the woman begins to fight for the dignity of
man, then we have reached an era of nonsexism.

The question is: What role can we play in the promotion of human rights? To
answer this, we need to look at three factors: Firstly, governments need to
be accountable for their actions and performance. Without such
accountability, governments face no pressure to meet reasonable standards
of governance and to ensure that an acceptable level of human rights is
maintained.

Secondly, there needs to be an effective functioning of civil society with
genuine participation in democratic processes, including the involvement of
women. Thirdly, governments need the institutional capacity to provide
effective services and maintain a sound enabling environment for the
protection of human rights.

Before concluding, I want to pay tribute to the role that many NGOs,
women's organisations and women, the makers of our future, have played in
supporting and promoting human rights.

My final message is that it is all too easy to pay lip service or to just
simply support human rights. We need a common sense approach that uses
elements of persuasion, support and, where necessary, pressure. I salute
all the women. Please, let me take the liberty to refer to an anonymous
quotation: ``The notion of male superiority is sheer fallacy.'' [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam
Speaker and hon members, taking into account the not-so-distant past, the
fact that we can gather here today to celebrate International Women's Day
is a triumph of democracy over iniquity. And while we are celebrating the
advances we have made, days like this allow us to take stock and regroup
for the way forward. Because of our particular history and in response to
our President's vision of an African Renaissance, I believe that as South
Africans we have an extremely important role to play in finding ways of
mainstreaming women's political, economic, social and developmental rights
into the regional and global agendas.

Our point of departure when addressing women's emancipation is that women's
rights are fundamental human rights. At the very heart of this debate, of
course, lies section 9 of our Constitution, which describes the right to
equality, the right I like to call our ``mother right''. This right gives
powerful impetus to women's empowerment across the board.

Realising the rights that are enshrined in our Constitution is now a
national preoccupation. We are therefore mindful of the severe impact of
poverty on human rights and especially on the rights of women. We know that
the majority of women continue to face marginalisation in their homes,
workplaces and communities. We will only succeed in our task if we manage
to close the gap between ambitious legislative measures and tangible
implementation and delivery on the ground. This year Government has
committed itself to intensifying its efforts to achieve economic and social
equity. In this regard, advancing the right to development is critical to
advancing women's human rights overall.

The implementation of a national policy and its implications for women in
the face of demands for equal pay and the prevalence of widespread unpaid
labour have recently revealed a strong tendency and trend towards the
feminisation of poverty in South Africa. There can be little doubt that the
face of poverty in this country is overwhelmingly the face of women and
particularly black African women. Given the fact that 35% of South African
households are headed by women and that 60% of these households now live
below the poverty line, the challenges for us as a nation are more than
considerable.

We know that the number of people living in poverty has increased globally
over the past decade. The distressing fact is that poverty has increased
disproportionately for women, and particularly for women in developing
countries. The growing feminisation of poverty demands that all development
programmes are characterised by a strong emphasis on realising the rights
of women. And, in determining the mechanisms that free women from the
stranglehold of poverty, we need further to explore the relationship
between poverty and increasing women's capacity to enjoy the rights
guaranteed to them by our Constitution and the relevant international
instruments such as Cedaw.

Our national socioeconomic and political discourse is underpinned by a
theme that emphasises the fight against poverty and underdevelopment.
Perhaps the single biggest direct contribution that the Department of
Justice can make to poverty alleviation is to ensure that the maintenance
system is accessible, reliable and free of corrupt practices. We have
prioritised this area of our work and are currently developing a
multifaceted model for improved service delivery in the many courts dotted
around our country. The maintenance innovation process will develop a
footprint for improved service delivery, and progress in this regard will
be reported to Parliament when the portfolio committee holds its hearings
in May later this year.

We take pride in the success of our specialised sexual offences courts that
make a difference to women and children who are subjected to sexual
violence. In respect of this programme, the department achieved its
projected target of 20 courts by the end of 2001. This year we plan to roll
out 10 more such courts to other parts of the country where a high
incidence of sexual violence has been identified.

Preliminary research at our Thuthuzela project has shown that when women
are provided with a supportive, survivor-centred court environment, they
are more willing to stay the distance and see matters through to
conviction. We will continue to refine our protocols, upgrade the skills of
the specialist teams working with rape victims, and expand the customised
infrastructure required for such programmes.

The SA Law Commission's recent discussion paper on sexual offences is an
important development and the department is looking at ways to fast-track
the introduction of draft legislation to Cabinet and ultimately Parliament
this year. Our Government has shown, and continues to show, its
determination to incorporate gender into all its policies, plans and
programmes.

The right of access to justice is a priority focus area for the Department
of Justice. Here, progress by the Legal Aid Board has been nothing short of
miraculous. To date 32 justice centres have been established, and a further
14 centres are planned for delivery during this year. The public defender
pilot project in the Cape High Court has been a remarkable success, and
this model will be rolled out to other courts incrementally.

The Legal Aid Board is also concentrating assistance to especially poor
women in civil matters such as divorce and maintenance, an area of their
work that they consider a constitutional imperative. In expanding access to
justice, the department has been tasked with effecting significant service
delivery improvements in our small claims courts. Proposals in this regard
will be finalised by the end of May.

At this juncture it would be remiss of me not to thank the many
commissioners that dedicate their time and energy to this work. This is the
spirit of Letsema in action.

Recognising the stark contribution that divorce makes to increased poverty
levels of women, the SA Law Commission has proposed that legislation be
drafted to regulate the sharing of retirement fund benefits between spouses
upon divorce. Accordingly the Sharing of Pension Benefits Bill will be
submitted to Cabinet during 2002.

The SA Law Commission reform process of the customary law of succession is
approaching completion. Many black women in customary marriages are
severely marginalised when their spouses die without a will. The practice
regulating the customary law of succession still has elements of gender
discrimination that have no place in our society.

This discriminatory practice still recognises the male offspring and the
male siblings before the widow when determining the devolution of an
intestate estate. We will submit the draft legislation to Cabinet before
the end of this year. We remain convinced that this legislation is another
significant step in countering the insidious effect of gender-perpetuated
poverty.

Judge Albie Sacks said on this matter:


  The foundational value of creating a nonsexist society is to be
  respected. Proper consideration has to be given to the way the measures
  concerned impact in practice, both on the dignity of widows and their
  ability to enjoy a rightful share of the family's wordly goods.

There are many more items in our women's rights programme that deserve
mention, but time constraints make this impossible. It is, however,
important to take cognisance of the strides that have been made, but it is
equally important to recognise that a long journey still lies before us.

Despite the daunting challenges we face in making women's human rights
real, the vision is clear, and the political will to succeed is
unequivocal. [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I want to quote from a small notice that
appeared in the Sowetan recently, as follows:


  Miriam Makeba underpinned her musical status by receiving the Polar Music
  prize for 2002 from King Karl Gustav XV of Sweden. Recognising her
  emphatic contribution to the upliftment of her people and giving hope to
  other people of the world, this award on her 70th birthday bears
  testimony to the fact that she is a woman of the people and the world.

The citation reads:


  Makeba embodied the concept of world music long before the term existed.
  It is by conveying the inherent strength and positive uplifting message
  found in a true love of music that Makeba has played an active role in
  the struggle against injustice and oppression. In the spirit of an old
  African idiom: Makeba now reaps what she sowed.

Today we as a nation can reap the sweet fruits of freedom that were sowed
with the blood, sweat and tears of many African women.

In 1972 a friend of mine went to London and visited the home of the late
Oliver Tambo. He remarked on how Mrs Tambo was a mother to all the exiles
in London while her husband was leading the struggle for liberation.

The tapestry of African history is covered by the role played by women
throughout the ages. Cleopatra was an African queen with rights and status.
The daughter of a pharaoh had the right to adopt the slave baby Moses. Her
status in the royal household saved the boy's life and allowed him to be
raised as a prince.

Afro-pessimists want us to believe that women have never enjoyed any status
in Africa. One must read the history of King Shaka's mother and of
Modjadji, the Rain Queen, a woman revered by men throughout the ages. The
abuse and violation of African women has always had a special place in the
history of colonial tyranny. The mass rape of Herero women by Germans
invading Namibia, the reservation of sex workers for colonists only, the
oppression of African women in Zambia and Uganda, and the exclusion of
women from colonial cities and formal-sector employment illustrate the
imperial perspective amplified through the trope of race.

Gedurende die Anglo-Boereoorlog het wit Afrikaner- en swart vroue ook gely
onder die mense met die twee paspoorte, een koloniaal en die ander Brits.
Ons lees uit dagboeke en geskrifte oor die oorlog van Johanna Brandt, 'n
spioen in die Kappiekommando:


  Die onreg ons aangedoen, die misdade deur die vyand gepleeg, die lyding
  in die konsentrasiekampe, die bitter haat en magtelose woede van die
  onderdruktes. Hierdie dinge het ek verswyg. Hulle is verby. Wie sal die
  verantwoordelikheid op onsself neem om die erfporsie van so 'n vreeslike
  geskiedenis aan die nageslag na te laat. Hoe swaar hulle ook gely, ons
  onvergeetlike heldinne - hoe tragies ook hul lot - hulle is bekroon en
  leef in die harte van diegene wat hul ideale trou bewaar het. Deur hul
  voorbeeld word ons innerlike krag versterk en opgebou.

Hendrina Rabie van der Merwe, 'n ander heldin, skryf:


  Van ons word verwag om te vergeet en maar alles toe te smeer. Bloed wil
  nie toegesmeer wees nie. Die vlek slaan altyd weer uit en die bodem van
  Afrika is deurweek met die bloed van ons burgers en die lyding van vroue
  en kinders. Hulle het die bitterste beker gelig en die droesem ook
  ingesuig. Hoe durf ons vergeet.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[During the Anglo-Boer War white Afrikaner women and black women also
suffered at the hand of the people with two passports, one colonial and the
other British. We read in diaries and in writings concerning the war of
Johanna Brandt, a spy in the Kappiekommando:

Part of the answer lies in post-colonial gender politics. Firstly, Africa's
new leaders were men raised in the context of colonisation, which Fanon
described as ``emptying the native's brain of all form and content''.
Perhaps we should not be surprised when such men, no matter what their
ideological persuasion, did not aim to transform oppressive gender
politics. No doubt these fathers of the nation sought to utilise women in
the national liberation struggle and later to advance the national
development agenda, assuming that this would be sufficient.

After those dark ages of oppression, there is some hope. The new South
Africa has distinguished itself in the annals of the continent's history in
more ways than one. As a late entrant to the theatre of African democracy,
brandishing a democratic Constitution that some of Europe's older
democracies could do well to emulate, the new South Africa is particularly
acclaimed for its efforts towards the advancement of women.

First on the list is the ANC's commendable attainment of the Beijing target
of at least 30% representation of women in Parliament, an achievement in
gender equality that places South Africa in the top 10 of the world's
democracies. We have pledged in our Constitution to ensure that women have
a full and equal role in every aspect of the economy and the society. Yet,
South African woman continue to face extraordinarily high levels of
violence, which prevent them from enjoying the rights that are guaranteed
under the new dispensation.

Gender equity is enshrined in our Constitution. It is defined as the power
relationship that allows men and women to have equal access to the scarce
and valued resources of society. These include wages, employment, leisure,
health care, education, personal autonomy and decision-making.

Women's contribution to the economy has been overlooked. Furthermore, their
contribution to the wealth and welfare of their families and the community
continues to be underremunerated. Over the past few decades many people,
women and men, have worked to develop and implement gender-equitable
policies for sustainable development and social transformation.

Sites of these struggle include a variety of organisational settings such
as public administrations, political parties, multilateral and bilateral
agencies, many private organisations and local decision-making bodies both
within Government and in the communities.

Putting gender equality on the political agenda has been part of an ongoing
struggle in relatively newly independent countries or countries moving from
totalitarian regimes to more democratic ones. In the transition from
liberation struggles to governance and reconstruction for equitable and
sustainable development, the transformation of institutions is central to
the goal of translating this vision into concrete policies, programmes and
practices. South Africa is a good example of the latter experience.

How shall we as South Africans respond to the evidence presented to us on
the violent abuse of women? We can criticise the Government; we can
criticise the Minister of Safety and Security; we can criticise the police,
as the DP has been doing - the new carriers of two passports; we as South
Africans can take hands in memory of all the great women of Africa. No more
will women be abused. No more will women be denied the rights and status
that we as men enjoy.

I want to end with the words of an African heroine from an Afrikaans poem I
learned as a child:


  Woedend tier die wilde bende:
  ``Sterf of gee die wit kind hier!''
  ``Oor my lewelose liggaam,'' antwoord Amakeia fier.

This black woman was willing to die to defend the right of a young white
boy. Let us defend women's rights with our lives. [Applause.]

Ms P GOVENDER: Madam Speaker, on this International Women's Day I wish to
start with a poem.


  We live and speak, no longer conscious of our wholeness, our
  connectedness.
  We have begun to believe we are fragments
  that our stories are disconnected from each other's.
  So often we have sat silently with our grief, our pain, our horror our
  anger, our hopelessness, our despair at how successfully we have been
  disembodied.
  We no longer hear our own voices.
  We no longer see our own faces.


  I know that in our hearts we cannot have forgotten who we are. In our
  hearts we cannot rubbish our collective dream and vision and the love
  that inspired courage across our land against the hate and fear of
  apartheid's patriarch who attempted to destroy, not just our communities
  but our very sense of self.


  Today is another battle we face both men and women With the patriarch
  within our minds
  who holds captive our hearts our souls his power of fear and hate his
  hierarchies of exclusion and silence, his memory of forgetting it is time
  to reclaim ourselves so collectively we can reclaim our power of love and
  courage. It is time for all of us, women and girls and the men and boys
  who love us and whom we love to subvert the patriarch in our minds, in
  our homes in our churches, in our temples, our mosques our schools, our
  workplaces, in all our institutions in our country, in our world.


  Apartheid-institutionalised violence, including misogyny - the hatred of
  women, entrenched patriarchal religion and tradition which equate women
  and sex with sin, lust and temptation; which sees menstruation as dirty
  and leaves little or no space for women and men to discuss sex and
  sexuality in ways which celebrate and honour the human body.


  Apartheid's migrant labour system contributed to widespread poverty and
  gender inequality. We knew who we were when we fought apartheid, when we
  voted for a new democracy, when we created a constitution of substantive
  equality, socioeconomic rights, the right to bodily integrity for all
  women - black and white, poor, rural, urban, disabled, lesbian or women
  with HIV/Aids. We knew who we were when we passed laws such as the Choice
  on Termination of Pregnancy Act, the Domestic Violence Act, the
  Maintenance Act, the Labour Relations Act, the Employment Equity Act, the
  Equality Act and so many other laws which advanced women's rights in
  relation to land, water, health, housing and education.


  We knew who we were when we began to work towards a gender-responsive
  Budget in the 1998-99 national Budget Review. We knew who we were when we
  started to change our institutions so that rural women could begin to
  control the water boards. We knew who we were when we established a
  parliamentary Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of the
  Quality of Life and Status of Women, whose mandate it is to monitor
  Government's implementation of Cedaw and the Beijing Platform of Action
  in relation to improving the quality of life and status of women,
  especially the poorest, and whose priorities are poverty, HIV/Aids and
  gender-based violence.


  In a study released last year entitled ``Being female in South Africa'',
  the authors conclude, and I quote:


  The girls of South Africa are generally confident, happy people who enjoy
  schooling. They know what they want to do after completing their
  schooling, and most want to study further. They know where to study.

As a society, the challenge we face individually and collectively is to
ensure that their hopes are not dashed by poverty, rape and HIV/Aids in a
context where 32% of young men surveyed believe forced sex with someone you
know is not sexual violence. A Love Life study revealed that one in four
young South Africans believe the lie that sex with a virgin cures Aids.

Last year, the Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of Quality of
Life and Status of Women held hearings with the following title: How best
can South Africa address the horrific impact of HIV/Aids on women and
girls. The committee unanimously adopted its report on 14 November 2001 and
tabled it in Parliament in February this year. We have asked for a debate
on the committee's report and that has been agreed to. So that will be
scheduled shortly in Parliament's programme.

Some of the issues that I wanted to deal with have been covered by Lulu
Xingwana and Cheryl Gillwald, so I am not going to deal with those. Suffice
to say that some of the challenges that remain is for us to ensure that we
give effect, as Government and Parliament, to addressing poverty,
employment, the social security system, and laws in relation to
decriminalising sex workers and trafficking in women and children.

This month, the committee will be launching the ``Male MPs Mobilising Men''
programme to reduce HIV/Aids and to end violence. Male MPs are being asked
to develop and present an ongoing programme to educate men and boys on the
roles that they can play to respect women's and girls' sexual rights - the
silence that we do not want to break, to speak [Applause.]
I want to conclude by sharing something. Last night the Gender Advocacy
Programme, GAP presented an award to me. Today I share that award with all
the women I have worked with in this Parliament, especially those who are
no longer here, such as Ruth Mompati, Gertrude Shope, Albertina Sisulu and
Ellen Khuzwayo. [Applause.] It belongs to all of us. [Applause.] Let it
inspire in us the courage to always be true to the women who put us here.

Ms A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, a view exists that by differentiating between
women's rights in particular and human rights in general, the position of
women is further degraded. This would, indeed, have been the case under
ideal circumstances and in a perfect world.

However, we do not live in a perfect world and  our  circumstances  are  far
from ideal. Every year throughout the world - and South  Africa  is  not  an
exception - a vast number of women and young girls are mutilated,  battered,
raped and murdered. Amnesty International reminds us  that  more  women  and
girls die each day because of various forms of  gender-based  discrimination
than as a result of any other type of human rights abuse.  It  is  for  this
reason that we still need a day on our international calendar  to  highlight
to the world the plight of billions of women and remind ourselves about  the
work that still needs to be done before we can talk about  equality  between
men and women.

The majority of the 1,5 billion people, living on a dollar or  less  a  day,
are women. Women, on average, still earn slightly  more  than  50%  of  what
their  male  counterparts  earn.  In  the  world,  110  million  school-aged
children, of whom two  thirds  are  girls,  still  do  not  have  access  to
education. Over 800 million adults, of whom 60% are women,  are  illiterate.
Yet,  we  recognise  that  education  empowers  the  poor,  safeguards   the
vulnerable and promotes social justice. With these statistics  in  mind,  it
is obvious that we cannot address human rights  before  we  address  women's
rights.

I would like to argue that women's rights are not only an  important  pillar
of human rights, but are, in fact, the foundation  of  human  rights.  Women
are the primary caretakers of families. They are also the  educators  during
children's most formative years. It is during this time that  the  basis  is
laid for the  approach  that  a  boy  child  would  have  towards  his  girl
counterparts. The way he will deal with, respect and interact with women  is
established at this early age.

In South Africa the rights of women are guaranteed under  our  Constitution.
Special programmes have been embarked upon to ensure that the upliftment  of
women takes place and that women are not only aware  of  their  rights,  but
actually take them up. We must acknowledge that a lot of progress  has  been
made, but we cannot deny that a lot of effort still needs to be put in.

It is especially the plight of the rural women and that  of  the  illiterate
that concern me most. To many of these women, life  has  not  changed  since
1994. They are not aware of their rights and we need to  ensure  that  these
rights, as they are enshrined in our Constitution, become a  living  reality
for them. We need to ensure that the lives of those women who need  it  most
are touched and changed by the knowledge of those rights.

Human rights will benefit if women are informed  and  educated  about  their
rights. The world would  be  a  better  place  once  women  can  take  their
rightful place within all sectors of  society.  Women  are  the  victims  of
conflict and violence, yet they remain absent from conflict  resolution.  In
a country that is characterised by  crime,  discrimination  and  many  other
injustices, women can  bring  particular  perspectives,  skills  and  unique
solutions.  Women  are  by  nature  caretakers  and  adopt   a   much   more
constructive and less adversarial approach towards  finding  solutions.  The
World Bank concluded in a study that women contribute  to  good  governance;
and that where the influence of women in public life is  higher,  the  level
of corruption is lower.

The aforementioned are but a few examples of how  women  can  influence  the
overall culture of human rights. I  believe  that  it  demonstrates  clearly
that the need for equal women rights is driven by an  all-encompassing  need
to establish a world culture of human rights.  That  is  why  I  argue  that
women's rights are not only an important pillar for human  rights,  but,  in
fact, the foundation thereof.

Allow me to end with a short poem  written,  ironically,  by  a  man  called
Hennie Aucamp.


  Eva aan Adam:
  Jy het jou aanvanklik geëien in my lyf,
  my beetgeneem en toe-geëien; jou wyf;
  nou eis ek, na eeue van lyfeienskap
  my eie, my self, my hele lyf.


  [Initially you defined yourself in my body,
  You took hold of me and claimed me; your concubine;
  Now I claim, after centuries of bodily servitude
  My being, myself, my whole body.]

[Applause.]

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Madam Speaker, I stand here today with mixed  feelings  in
participating in this debate; feelings of  pride  and,  at  the  same  time,
feelings of shame. I feel ashamed that in this day  and  age  we  are  still
debating the human rights of a certain section of our society.

We have fought for the liberation of our people throughout the world. We
have liberated our people in South Africa. Yet we are still talking human
rights and we are still talking about people who are not treated fully as
human beings. That cannot be right.

It cannot be right when we have an economic system in a  society  that  does
not recognise the rights of other people as full human beings. When we  have
people in the system who lock certain people  in  factories  to  work  until
they die, that cannot be right.  I  cannot  be  proud  of  that  kind  of  a
society. I cannot be proud of myself for being part  thereof.  Particularly,
I cannot not be proud of being a man when, in the majority, it is  men  that
are operating  those  factories  that  exploit  women  in  that  kind  of  a
situation. [Applause.]

We have heard reports from Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and  elsewhere.  Recently,
a woman gave birth to twins in Newcastle. She was locked in the factory  and
both of those  babies  died.  Can  we  be  proud  of  those  situations?  We
definitely cannot. We cannot be proud  of  this  situation  when  there  are
certain people, particularly men,  who  regard  women  as  sex  objects.  We
cannot be proud of that.

I am certainly proud that I am standing here today, congratulating women
who are leading in this struggle, congratulating women who have been part,
not only of the struggle to liberate women so that they are treated as
human beings, but to liberate humankind. I am speaking here of great women
... [Applause] ... who participated proudly in this struggle, in this
movement for the betterment of humankind. I am speaking here about women
like Lilian Ngoyi. I am speaking about women who sacrificed their lives,
who made the supreme sacrifice, like Ruth First. I am speaking here about
women whom the barbaric leaders, led by men, saw fit to bomb - women like
Jabu Mtalane in Swaziland, who died in the struggle for the liberation of
people.

Today we are commemorating this kind of involvement by women. I am speaking
here about women like MaCharlotte Maxeke. I am speaking about women like
Victoria Mxenge who fought for everybody's right. I am speaking here about
women like Phyllis Naidoo. I am proud to stand here and associate myself
with this Parliament that is leading in this positive struggle for the
right of every human being and every individual.

For the first time in the history of this country, everybody is standing
here and enumerating the legislation that has gone through this very
Parliament, that has gone through this very House, to better the lives,
particularly, of women. I am proud to be associated with that kind of
Parliament. I am proud to be associated with an organisation like the
African National Congress and its alliance. Had it not been for this
organisation, we would not be speaking as we are speaking today.

What we should do is to ensure the implementation of policies that we have
passed here. We must ensure that the voices of public servants, such as the
ones in the Department of Labour, are heard. These people who are
continuing with these barbaric acts must be exposed and punished.

It is the duty of every member of this House to ensure the implementation
of all these laws. It is the duty of this Parliament and each member of
this House, as well as members of the public, to ensure that the
resolutions like the ones taken at the recent National Land Tenure
Conference in Durban, are implemented so that women, as human beings, can
also enjoy those rights. We must not treat women in a shameful way,
something which these instruments ought to deal with. They are human beings
like everybody else. [Applause.] They are equal partners in the bringing
about of our society, and therefore they have the right to land and
everything else. We must ensure that those resolutions and pieces of
legislation are passed and implemented effectively.

I am proud to be associated with the women Ministers of this Parliament.
They have proved that when we speak of women, we speak of human beings.
Minister Thoko Didiza spoke about a woman farmer towards the end of last
year, and she also spoke about programmes to promote the participation of
women in agriculture everywhere. I am proud to be associated with people of
that sort.

I am proud to be associated with people like Minister Mlambo-Ngcuka, who is
energising the entire country, so that women should not have to fetch water
and wood in order to energise their homes and improve the lives of our
families. [Applause.] And I am saying that, as men, we must stand up and
show that we are civilised. We live in this day and age, when we cannot
continue to stifle the lives of other people. [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers and colleagues, the preamble of a
document compiled by the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women entitled A
Proposed UN Convention Against Sexual Exploitation goes as follows:


  Prostitution, sex tourism, trafficking in women and other practices that
  reduce women to sexual commodities have had a particularly devastating
  impact on women in developing countries and oppressed groups of women in
  so-called developed countries. The sexual exploitation of any woman is
  cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment that establishes the standard of
  treatment for all women and is incompatible with the inherent dignity and
  worth of the human person. No existing international human rights
  instruments adequately address the problem of sexual exploitation.

The Constitutional Court is presently hearing argument relating to the
decriminalisation of prostitution in South Africa, which is promoted as a
women's right and sold as the solution to the very problems it in fact
creates. Where exactly is the human dignity in selling one's body for sex
and what recourse exists for the protection of women and children who are
sexually exploited for the sake of profit? Prostitution or commercial sex
work is a hazardous occupation, harmful to both the prostitute and her
client, as well as their families and society as a whole. Prostitution
exploits women for the gratification of the buyer's sexual urges. Too many
women in various parts of the world are expected, or even sold, to become
prostitutes serving Western or Japanese businessmen as a means of
supporting families. How much more would this be the case once prostitution
is accepted as legal?

Prostitution always plays a disproportionate role in promoting the spread
of the HIV pandemic. Absurdly, the fact that this segment of society is
largely poor and overwhelmingly women, who are vulnerable to various forms
of exploitation, is stated as an argument for decriminalising prostitution,
when in fact this sort of judgment would further entrench the perception
that the dignity of the poor is not worth protecting.

Prostitution does not liberate, but condemns and enslaves women. The ACDP
will not abandon women in this critical hour, as others do for the sake of
being politically correct. The ACDP supports the position by the recent
commission on prostitution of the Swedish government, that the sex trade
remains criminalised because a penal provision would serve a normative
purpose that makes it clear that prostitution is not socially acceptable.
For many clients the risk of discovery, police investigation and legal
proceedings would be a powerful deterrent.

We believe that prostitution should be clearly rejected, discouraged and
criminalised. In the event of criminalisation, penal liability should be
incurred by both the buyer and the seller, including pimps and madams.
There should be harsher sentences for clients, as in the USA. Structures
should be put in place for the rehabilitation of prostitutes. For this
purpose psychological and social welfare services, psychotherapists, etc,
should be involved in therapy work.

We commend the work done by organisations, like The House in Hillbrow,
which are trying to rehabilitate prostitutes and suggest that they be
supported wherever possible. Many clients making regular use of prostitutes
are probably also in need ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I now call the hon Mrs Seeco. Congratulations, Mrs
Seeco, this is your maiden speech. [Applause.]

Mrs M A SEECO: Madam Speaker, over the years International Women's Day has
taken women to the streets and sparked off a revolution. The history of
International Women's Day dates back to 1910 internationally. The day has
been variously seen as a time for asserting women's political and social
rights, to review the progress that women have made on this day of
celebration.

Born at a time of great social turbulence and crisis, International Women's
Day inherited protest and political activism. In the years before 1910,
from the turn of the 20th century, women in industrially developing
countries were entering paid work in some numbers.

In 1908, on the last Sunday of February, socialist women in the United
States initiated the first Women's Day when a large demonstration took
place, calling for the vote and the political economic rights of women. The
following year 2 000 people attended a Women's Day rally in Manhattan.

In 1909 women garment workers staged a general strike for better pay and
working conditions. In 1910 Women's Day was taken up by socialists and
feminists throughout the country. Later that year delegates went to the
second international conference of social women in Copenhagen, with the
intention of proposing that Women's Day becomes an international event.
Inspired by the action of US women workers and their socialist sisters,
Clara Zetkin had already framed a proposal to put to the conference of
socialists women throughout the world should focus on a particular day each
year to press for their demands.

Yet many women continue to see International Women's Day as an important
occasion for reviewing, stating and occasionally acting on the political,
economic and social rights of women. Nonetheless, International Women's Day
and the women who had organised it helped to keep alive a tradition of
political involvement, often in hostile circumstances. The next decade of
feminist development was to change radically political priorities and
agendas.

I saw it as an educational aid to make women aware of their power and also
to carry on the proud tradition where women had stood up for themselves.
Today younger women have taken International Women's Day to heart. We see
International Women's Day as a campaign needing work almost all year round,
with 8 March as the highlight rather than a one-day function.

There are legends like the late Alina Lekgetha, the daughter of Ditheko,
who was born at Motlatla in Thaba Nchu. Married teachers had the
opportunity to teach because these legends fought for them in 1978,
ensuring their right to teach even if they were married. She is the first
woman member of Parliament. So says the UCDP. [Applause.]]

[Ms S D MOTUBATSE: Mr Chairperson and hon members of Parliament, we are now
in the second year of the new millennium. We are here, at this point in
time, as women of the beautiful continent of Africa. However, whenever
people talk about our continent, they always associate it with hunger,
poverty, suffering and all types of diseases. However, our hope is based on
the fact that we are entering the new millennium with great expectations.
The source of these expectations is the fact that we saw our leaders, at
the end of the previous millennium, meeting, discussing and correcting one
another's mistakes.

We remember that, during the previous millennium, when our continent
attempted to unite, there were Nicodemuses who wanted to know how a whole
continent could be born again.

As women of South Africa, who are working together with other women in our
region and throughout the continent, we have great expectations. We noted
that, in 1960, there were only three countries in Africa that had attained
independence. By the end of the millennium, however, we, the South
Africans, though last, had also attained our freedom. [Applause.] What does
this mean to us, as women of South Africa? We are sad that even in those
countries that attained their freedom long before us, there is still a
sector that has not attained its freedom - the women.

We can all look back at where we have come from, at our culture, because
people often hide behind it. We know, however, that according to culture a
woman is treated with respect. A woman is treated with kindness and
tenderness. [Applause.] Many women on the African continent are facing
great suffering; they lack the means to warm up their homes. However, they
are looking to the current dispensation in the hope that everything will
change.

Today, when we say that we are surprised by what is said about our culture,
I would like to take you back a little, and examine what was happening
before we attained our freedom in the 60s. We encountered people who came
to tell us that our way of life was wrong. When a person practises other
people's cultures and abandons his or her own, can he or she do justice to
it? They cannot do justice to it; what they know best is their own culture
and not another person's culture. Today, after all these things have
happened, women are looked down upon, because at the time when those people
came here, the women were not strong enough to carry objects of steel and
do other jobs that were required by those people. For that reason, we were
belittled and our people perpetuated this practice. The challenge that is
facing us today is that of changing mind-sets.

We noted that this was beginning to happen towards the end of the previous
millennium. However, we are saying that it is not enough. Let us make a
meaningful difference; let us progress further; let us rectify all the
wrongs that have happened in this country of ours.

There are other terrible things that are going on on our continent. I am
reluctant to mention some of them. Leaders of member states of the African
Union agreed in Kenya in 1981 that there should be an acceptable and
appropriate programme to protect human rights and to ensure that the people
of this continent develop their cultures. What is not recognised on this
issue is the fact that women's rights are neglected. Owing to that lack of
recognition, terrible things are perpetrated on our women.

I would like to cite an example that also shocked me. In some countries men
take their wives to medical practitioners and have them fitted with
chastity belts, saying that they wanted to prevent them from being
promiscuous. We are not sure that this is likely to stop promiscuity. When
one looks at all these things, one concludes that a woman is not respected,
that she has no human rights and that it is for that reason that she is
made to do all these things.

We spent some time at the University of Pretoria, as women and women's
organisations, discussing the law that deals with human rights in Africa.
It is most unfortunate that, when this law is translated into other
languages, it leaves out a number of details. According to Ms Van Wyk the
French version is completely off the mark. This law is described as charte
Africaine des droits de l'homme, which means ``the rights of men''.
Therefore many people use this loophole to sidestep the issue and neglect
what they should be doing about it in their countries.

Another difficulty is that these international agreements are signed, but
not incorporated into the laws of individual countries and, consequently,
they are not implemented. What gives us hope is the fact that women are now
aware that their leaders have signed these agreements. As women, we must
advise one another as to how we can help one another to find out from the
leaders of the countries that are lagging behind why they have not signed.

Another issue is that, when we looked at clause 2 of section 18, we noted
that it deals with discrimination on the basis of a person's body parts. It
was obvious that people were not calling a spade a spade. They avoid the
issue because they only talk of parts of the body instead of spelling out
how a woman should be taken care of. We, as the women, propose that all
these mistakes should be rectified. Fortunately, the Chairperson and the
Deputy Chairperson are people who work easily with everybody. We hope,
therefore, that when they are over there, they will ensure that all these
clauses are amended accordingly and that things will be made to work
properly once gain.

I took some time to read the Good Book. I read it with the intention of
understanding the exact words of God when He gave Adam a helper. I was
surprised not to find any words that say: Adam, here is your lackey or:
Adam, here is your slave. The Good Book does not say so. The Good Book
speaks of a helper. Now, what I would like to know is: can a person help
another when that person is ignorant? [Applause.] I would like us to look
seriously into this matter. Naturally, a woman is wiser than a man.
[Applause.] it is for that reason that a man must have a friendly
relationship with his wife so that he too may be wise. [Applause.]

We believe that when we monitor closely what is happening today, as women,
our intention is to ensure that the Nepad programme is implemented on time.
We feel that, since mistakes have already been made, if Africa could be
restructured to include Nepad, our needs, as women, will be recognised and
implemented.

My appeal relates to when we leave Parliament - we are already becoming
restless, saying: When are we leaving, because the women are waiting for us
out there? We are used to the concept of working in teams, we grew up doing
it. Even now, we are itching to get to work. Women are waiting for us out
there, they want to know what Nepad has got for them. That way, we want to
go and hold discussions with our people and agree on the way forward so
that, when we embark on the development of the continent, we will have
started with development at home. There is a lot of work that needs to be
done here, at home, and we appeal to our women in the rural areas to come
and work with us to correct what we deem to be wrong and to help the
children of our continent.

Many people fail to understand why there are so many people who have
immigrated to our country. We know, however, that we cannot send them back;
we cannot expel them. All we can do is to ensure that Nepad is implemented
and facilitate development in their countries of origin.

Finally, I request that whatever we do, as this House, we must do together,
because, as some speakers have already pointed out, this cannot be achieved
by the ANC alone. Other parties must also ensure that there are more women
in their ranks, because when we interact with those women we will be able
to build our country and our continent. [Applause.]]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, on this important Women's Day, it is
important to affirm that the goal of gender equality is a responsibility
which men and women must share equally in our country. It is time we all
rose to the challenge.

The United Nations Millennium Summit agreed to halve poverty, reduce
maternal mortality by three quarters and achieve equal access for girls to
all levels of education.

What resources in the national Budget have we been allocated to ensure
women's survival, options and opportunities? It is more imperative than
ever before that promises to the women of this country made in Beijing are
turned into action. When public services, such as water, electricity,
education and health care are privatised, it is women who suffer the
consequences of the selling off of these assets. The PAC will continue to
struggle with millions of women in this country in the campaigns against
water cuts.

In order to curb the HIV infection rate, we must take measures to address
the fact that women are biologically, economically and culturally more
vulnerable to contracting the virus. We must give women the right and power
to refuse unwanted and unprotected sex. The demand for women's access to
primary health care means that every HIV-positive pregnant mother should
have the right to nevirapine without delay.

On this day, International women's Day, the PAC and its component
structure, the Pan Africanist Women's Organisation, pledge solidarity ...
[Interjections] ... with the struggles of the women of Angola, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Palestine and Afghanistan. We support their
demand for peace and reconstruction in their respective countries. I would
normally react, but I respect the women. Izwe lethu! [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, Malibongwe! [Praise!]

HON MEMBERS: Igama lamakhosikazi! [The name of women!]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Today, 13 women out of the 18 speakers who took the podium
of the Parliament of South Africa have spoken about the rights of women -
women, the mothers of our nation. In our diversity we are in unison, as we
come from the womb of a woman.

Many socialists agree that the key character in the primary socialisation
of an offspring is the mother. But in a patriarchal society the influence
of the mother is great.

With all of us having originated from a patriarchal society, home and all
that is domestic has always been stereotyped as for women or mothers. While
this patriarchal society viewed women as a weaker sex and in need of
protection and being sheltered from the world's ruin, time took its toll.
These attitudes are now labelled oppressive.

Women have been dominated by religion, tradition, culture and norms, but we
have reached an era where the muted voice of women has pitched high as we
strive to make our mark. The aim is not to take over the role of men or
disregard religion, tradition and culture, but rather to take an equal
stand and contribute our many talents and abilities for the betterment of
all and our country.

Our Constitution, the supreme law of the country, contains a Bill of
Rights, which does not represent only a portion of South African citizenry,
but all South Africans, that means women as well. That means that these
rights must be upheld and the contravention thereof would be a
contravention of the Constitution, which is a punishable offence. Women
should take the initiative to educate themselves about their rights and not
choose to be victims. Educating women about their rights would ensure the
primary socialisation of the future citizenry regarding its rights, human
rights, and so forth.

The MF applauds all departments and NGOs that work hard to provide women
with knowledge, as well as all women who choose to uphold their rights. Hon
members should remember that: No woman, no country; no woman, no home; no
woman, no mother; no woman, no society, and no woman, no Parliament.
[Applause.] Women are an important pillar of human rights. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, in South Africa, where human rights
form the basis of our Constitution, women are progressing in many spheres
of our society. Some women are now in Parliament and some are in jobs that
they were denied in the past. But in our society women's status and dignity
is diminished by the number of women who are homeless, jobless, dependent,
some of whom are still treated like slaves.

Azapo believes that the dignity of any group in society is enhanced by the
collective dignity and power which that group wields. For example, up until
today, the dignity of individuals in our country is dependent on the
collective dignity of the racial group that the person belongs to. By
virtue of their social and economic status in society, women have the
lowest collective dignity in South Africa and elsewhere in the world, both
as individuals and as a collective.

Women's rights can only be enhanced if they themselves realised what
collective power they could wield if they united across the political,
religious and cultural divide. It is therefore our duty and responsibility
as a nation to enhance the individual and collective dignity of women, not
only by way of appointing them to positions of power and responsibility,
but by supporting their struggle and showing them solidarity.

It is not enough merely to appoint women to positions of responsibility. It
is not enough merely to come here and ululate about the struggle of women.
We need to do much more than just appoint them to positions of
responsibility. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I apologise. I was so struck by the
presence of the same two male names next to each other on this list that I
mixed them up. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker and hon members, I participated in the
observation or celebration of International Women's Day as a state of
emergency detainee at St Albans in 1985.

International Women's Day became an important calender item for the
duration of our tortuous detention. The inclusion of this in our yearly
itinerary was influenced by ex-Robben Island inmates, two of whom are
members of this august House, Comrade Henry Fazzie and Comrade Benson
Fihla, as well as others like Edgar Ngoyi, Ernest Malgas and Silas
Mntongana.

Being young activists then, we could not fail to recognise that these
comrades had internalised the importance of this subject as a result of
years of engagement with it. For us as young lions it was difficult to
understand what informed their passion for this subject. Most importantly,
we never thought that the vision they were elaborating would unfold and
find practical expression in our lifetime at such an amazing breathtaking
speed since the advent of democracy in 1994.

I highlight this personal experience to illustrate the point that the
Congress Alliance, and the ANC in particular, were seized with the agenda
of women's emancipation from long ago, and that the ANC continues to do so
to this very day. We need to acknowledge the pioneering role that the
leadership of the ANC and the tripartite alliance has provided, not only to
the South African nation, but to the African continent and the whole world
on this subject.

We can, without fear of contradiction, make the assertion that the gains
South Africa has made towards the creation of a society which recognises
women as equals is the fruit largely of years of toil, sweat and tears by
the ANC and the revolutionary alliance it leads.

The understanding of the ANC is that women's emancipation is a crucial
prerequisite for a fully democratic dispensation. Democracy and women's
emancipation are two sides of the same coin and the one cannot be divorced
from the other.

As early as 1955, in that historic congress of the people, the seeds of the
kind of society that we sought to build were planted. It was at this
congress in Kliptown that the quest for the ideal of a nonracial, nonsexist
south Africa was expressed. It was expressed in the following words and I
quote:


  ... that only a democratic state, based on the will of the people, can
  secure for all their birthright without distinction of colour, race, sex
  or belief.

It went further and said that the people shall govern  and  that  every  man
and woman shall have the right to vote for  and  to  stand  for  all  bodies
which make laws. The rights of the people shall be the  same  regardless  of
race, colour or sex. This is what the Freedom Charter stated.

These pronouncements of the Freedom Charter became the foundation of the
understanding of this subject by the ANC, and informs its gender policy.
High on the agenda of the ANC is the task of ensuring equality among the
racial, ethnic, language, cultural and religious communities. Central to
this is ensuring equality between women and men.

We are from a past that was based on the systematic suppression of talents,
creativity and capacity of women to play their rightful role in the
ordering of the nation's affairs. More than any other sector, colonial
oppression and a patriarchal culture, including socially constructed gender
roles, conspired to degrade women and treat them as subhuman. These gender
roles permeate all spheres of life, beginning with the family, and are
entrenched by stereotypes, dominant ideas, cultures and beliefs.
The post-1994 period has ushered in a culture which desires to affirm
gender equality, which is central to women's emancipation. We have made
significant strides in engendering this culture. It is not an accident of
history that our Parliament and Government as institutions are amongst the
most notable in gender representivity. The fundamental objective of the
legal framework we have created since 1994 is to create an atmosphere
compatible to gender equality.

Our programmes, both at Government level and as legislatures, have made a
significant impact on engendering gender equality. Examples are the
provision of running water to more than 7 million people and our intention
to reach 7 million more. Our electrification programme translated into 2,3
million electricity grid connections. The housing programme delivered more
than 1,2 million houses to our people. These are but a few of the examples
of the programmes we roll out to alleviate poverty, whose main victims are
the women, in particular the African women.

The eradication of poverty must be understood to be central to all we do to
attain gender equality. The central question that we will have to answer at
the end of the day is whether what we are doing as the legislature, the
executive and the judiciary, as well as the fourth estate, helps to lift
from the shoulders of our people the intolerable burden of poverty and
underdevelopment.

We in the ANC are committed to advancing equality amongst women and men. In
the context of Vukuzenzele, we urge everybody to continue the remaining
work. We have made advances, yet a lot still needs to be done. As public
representatives, it is our task to assist in educating society about the
equality of men and women, the manner in which we should treat each other,
not as subhumans, but as proud citizens, equals and people of equal
abilities. [Applause.]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Madam Speaker, the DP condemns the South African Government
for disregarding its international obligations with respect to the
protection of the rights of women by, firstly, failing to provide
appropriate health care, particularly the provision of antiretroviral drugs
for rape survivors and, secondly, the prevention of gender-based violence.

We believe that women's rights equals health rights, equals human rights.
The Aids legal network states, I quote:


  The virus attacks the fundamental human rights of women, leaving them
  powerless to protect themselves against infection.


  The international and the South African response to the epidemic has
  compounded this abuse of rights by failing to recognise the disadvantaged
  status of women - this is a cause of their vulnerability to HIV - and by
  refusing to permit the rights and needs of women to play a part in
  shaping HIV strategies.

Amnesty International, in a recent letter to the Joint Monitoring Committee
on the Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Women, noted that they
have reviewed the standard and medical treatment protocols as a means of
conveying the widespread nature of the concern that exists regarding the
great threats the rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls which
arise particularly from the conjuncture of gender-based violence and the
spread of HIV/Aids in South Africa.

Amnesty International further maintains that the action of the Mpumalanga
provincial MEC for health, Ms Sibongile Manana, with regard to the greater
Nelspruit Rape Intervention Project Group, appears to be, and I quote:


  ... in conflict with these human rights and medical standards and
  contrary to South Africa's obligations to ensure the best available
  standards of care for survivors of sexual violence.

In a letter to the MEC herself, Amnesty International points out that it
campaigns for human rights on the basis of standards voluntarily agreed to
by the international community. Its concern is solely with the impartial
protection of human rights, independent of political ideology and other
interests. Its core mission is focused on preventing and ending grave
abuses of the rights to physical and mental integrity, freedom of
conscience an expression of freedom of discrimination, principles that are
supported and were fought for by most members of this House.

Certainly, the South African Government, as a party and signatory to
international and regional human rights treaties such as the UN Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Cedaw, and
the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, is obliged to respect,
protect and fulfil all women's rights, and to take all necessary
administrative or legislative measures to prevent human rights abuses and
provide redress to the victims of abuses. Amnesty International further
points out that the obligation is the same, whether the abuses are
committed by the state or by private individuals, as is the case in the
majority of incidents of rape in South Africa.
From our side, I would like to remind this House that the DP was one of the
first political parties in South Africa to repose the ratification of Cedaw
in 1990. We contend that the South African Government is implicitly denying
these rights and, indeed, itself abusing those rights by not supplying
antiretroviral treatment to rape survivors, especially because of the high
incidence of HIV/Aids in this country. This means that not only are women's
rights being violated, but also human rights, as is the case in a recent
Treatment Action Campaign, TAC, court judgment.

The majority of rape survivors in this country cannot afford to pay for
prophylactic treatment and the lack of Government policy or budget to
enable state hospitals and clinics to provide the medicines
disproportionately affects poor black rural South African women. They
therefore cannot even exercise their right to choose in deciding what is
good for them, as prescribed in the Constitution. The state makes that
decision for them by not making the treatment available or affordable.
The JMC on the Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Women must be
congratulated on their brave stand in calling for a holistic response to
prevention and treatment that addresses HIV/Aids, poverty, and gender-based
violence. It is only once such policies are implemented that South
Africans, men and women, can hold their heads up high and truly say that
they uphold women's rights and consequently human rights in this regard.
[Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, hon members, when the Women's National
Commission in the US in 1908 recommended that a day be set aside each year
to focus on the needs of women, nobody realised that a lot of history would
be written every year by women almost everywhere on this particular day.

We celebrate this day today and declare that women's rights are a pillar of
human rights. We acknowledge that our Constitution, especially the Bill of
Rights, makes provision for the equality of men and women. We acknowledge
and congratulate this Parliament on passing laws that bring us nearer to
gender equity. Women's rights have been confined, unfortunately, to the
traditional roles of women. And, when one starts defining human rights as
the rights that everybody has by virtue of being human, one takes away the
rights that women have as a group, because then these rights fall outside
one's definition of human rights. Therefore, we would call for a better
understanding and the inclusion of women's rights into the whole
understanding of what human rights are all about.

Men, generally and traditionally, occupy the public spheres of society,
which include the economy, politics, the law and the church, while we women
are confined to our private spheres, the home and the family. This public-
private division has largely determined the value a society places on its
women. It would be difficult for us to look at poverty alleviation,
especially in the rural areas, without making reference to these
traditional roles as they strongly connect to the economic and political
positions of women.

Until South Africa wakes up to the call to make women's rights human
rights, the violence in the home will continue to increase and more women
will continue to die at the hands of their partners, despite the very
improved Domestic Violence Act.

The realisation that a woman's right to live without fear has not really
been extended to the home came when the Commissioner of Police expressed
his doubts about the justiciability of domestic assault. For as long as we
women of this country allow magistrates like the black female magistrate in
Pretoria to pass lenient and suspended sentences to child rapists and
rapists, then we, too, contribute towards the not-so-equal status of women
in this country.

We need to take hands in the proper Letsima fashion to take a stand against
lenient and sometimes irresponsible judgments that are passed down by our
courts. We are women, we shall be respected. We demand disciplinary action
to be taken against the police officers who not only use foul language and
humiliate detainees, but sometimes rape them. When found guilty these
officers must be expelled. We demand the same from the Department of
Education - teachers who rape schoolchildren must be expelled. There cannot
be a situation in which we just talk about it; they must be expelled.
[Applause.]

We challenge ourselves as a society to do away with the unhygienic practice
of virginity testing. Not only are these tests demeaning to girls,
depriving them of dignity and respect, but they are also potential
spreaders of disease. In addition, they contribute towards the value which
is attached to girl-children and not to boy-children, and towards
identification of virgins within communities, which then leads to the
targeting of these virgins by mad men, who think that they will cure
themselves of Aids by sleeping with virgins. [Applause.]

We, the women of this country, need to hold hands with our men and
reinforce the right of women to safety, to respect and to dignity. Our
African cultures, diverse as they may be, have one thing in common, and
that is the respect and protection of the weakest and the oldest.
Therefore, the protection of children, women, and the aged must be
integrated in our Letsima programmes. In his state of the nation address,
the President referred to initiatives to roll back the frontiers of
poverty.

Unless we address the skewed access to education for girl children and
women, we cannot hold back the frontiers of poverty. Unless we start
educating and making sure that there are specific programmes for adult
learners, we cannot start hoping that women will comprehend and take
advantage of what comes out of the system to be able to gain a foothold in
the economic activities of this country. Therefore, the walls of poverty
will remain intact.

The continued inability of South African women to negotiate relationships,
especially their sexual relationships, needs to be reconsidered because
this continued inability of women includes the inability to exercise fully
their economic, social and political rights. We challenge, therefore, the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development to hurry up and bring
that sexual offences Bill to Parliament. We are concerned at the length of
time that it has taken this department to give protection to women who find
themselves in customary unions in the rural areas, because succession and
inheritance are very difficult to deal with, therefore the walls of poverty
remain intact. [Applause.]

The question of the Umsobomvu Fund should also be looked at. How much has
been allocated to girl children and young women from that fund? Why is it
that South Africa has never considered having a women-specific development
programme, when we know that women are the ones who are mostly illiterate
and poor, especially in the rural areas? [Applause.]

We therefore want to urge that such a programme should benefit South
African women. We have listened to each other lamenting and sometimes
congratulating ourselves on our achievements. We have also heard about the
desperation of women who are HIV-positive. I want to ask: Where is the
female condom? Why is it that it is not as freely accessible as the male
condom? When do we get this device? The provision of this device will not
only help to protect women against HIV/Aids, it will also allow women to
exercise their reproductive rights and therefore, by extension, their
economic rights. [Applause.]

For women's rights to be recognised, they need to be identified and
mainstreamed. The private and public protection of women must be
guaranteed. As South Africa enters into the founding leadership of the
African Union, the women of Africa need to organise strongly against
continued female genital mutilation and enforced dress codes. The freedom
of movement and association needs to be literally and figuratively
understood.

As we are looking at renewing the national skills, we as women in this
House need to task ourselves with being very actively involved in the
National Women's Audit to audit the skills we have to identify whatever
gaps we have and make a stand, so that Government is pushed to provide for
the skills which we think are necessary for women to make any advancement.
As part of Letsima, we need to enable women to put food on the table.
Therefore, the Departments of Health, Education, Welfare, Water Affairs and
Agriculture need to come up with a programme that will enable women to have
gardens and to continue having gardens, in order to have access to better
food.

I submit that Khula and Ntsika need to be reviewed. I do not know of any
woman who can attest to having had success with any application that has
been put in front of these bodies. We need to reclaim our streets. We need
to take back the night. We need to reinforce and reward good behaviour
within our society. We need to involve our children in the regeneration of
morals within our society. We cannot leave them out.

We as South African society also drink too much, and most crimes that
affect women and children are directly linked to the huge consumption of
liquor in this country. The tot system, which was introduced years ago, is
still continuing to adversely affect us in South Africa. As part of Letsima
we must address the issue of drinking. [Applause.]

We must also address the problem of fake marriages which are taking place.
I do not know why the Department of Safety and Security is failing to
arrest the people who steal women's identity documents. I do not understand
why Home Affairs takes so long to annul those marriages. I do not
understand the attitude of officials within the two departments towards the
victims, because one would think that the woman is the one who has done
wrong when she asks for the marriage to be done away with. Therefore, we
need the victims to be protected.

As we stand here, I was expecting that, for once, we would speak with one
voice. It is International Women's Day. We, unfortunately, hear that
Governments's social spending has declined. This is not true, because had
the hon member Mrs Sono looked at the Budget she would have noticed that
most funds are going towards poverty alleviation. If we push funding into
poverty alleviation, is it not social spending? [Interjections.]

Let us stand today in solidarity with women, irrespective of their
political affiliations. We remember the women in Bosnia, in Pakistan, in
India, in Israel, in the DRC, in Burundi and in East Timor. We express our
hope for peace in Palestine, in the DRC, in Zimbabwe and in Afghanistan. I
say: Happy International Women's Day! [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Madam Speaker, our
debate today indeed reflected varying and rich views on women's rights
being an important pillar of human rights. As we listened today I am sure
there were many of us who remembered the words of Dora Tamana who, at the
age of 82 in 1981, at the inaugural conference of the United Women's
Organisation, made a call on women to organise. She said:


  You who have no work - speak! You who have no homes - speak! You who have
  no schools - speak! You who have to run like chickens from the vulture -
  speak! We must free ourselves! Women and men must share housework. Men
  and women must work together in the home and in the world ... I opened
  the door for you - you must go forward!

Yes, Dora Tamana was one of the many women who opened the door - many came
before her and those who followed too. She would indeed have heard with
pride some of the inputs made here today - some of the inputs - because she
would have heard the voices of women speaking out, both within the home and
about the home, in more than just the family home, our national home and
the world.

Let us look at the country again from a national perspective and remind
ourselves that there are many women in this House, and elsewhere, who were
involved and were among those who were the founding parents of the drafting
of our Constitution. If we look at the founding provisions, we will see
that, indeed, in our Constitution, in the founding provisions and in the
Bill of Rights, we ensured that, crafted in this very critical document,
women's rights would be a central and an important pillar of human rights.

The challenge that we have today is translating that into the actual
implementation where it is experienced and felt and where it makes a
difference to every woman, child and everyone who is vulnerable in every
corner of this country. But, what is more, today we have clearly stated
that celebrating International Women's Day is also about solidarity among
women, nationally and internationally. I am not going to repeat what was
stated in so many eloquent voices, different ways and different languages
today, again reflecting that, in this House, we have women representing
women from every corner of our country who never lose sight of the
international solidarity that is required.

However, there were also dissenting voices. Earlier on, Mrs Semple, an hon
member from the left, made an input that clearly reflected that sometimes
in this House we listen but we do not hear. The hon Minister of Health made
a statement before this House in which she reflected on the roll-out of the
provision of nevirapine in the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission
Programme. I must say there was, at some point, noise and laughter. Maybe
that drowned out the ability to listen. I want to quote her words, and I
suggest that the member should get her speech. She said that, in terms of
the coverage:


  This means that we are already covering between 10% to 15% of the
  antenatal bookings in the country in less than one year. This translates
  to approximately 3 133 pregnant women per month that we are reaching
  through this programme.

She went on to say -


  As you can see, some of these recommendations need serious planning
  and cannot be done overnight.

She went further and said:


  It argues that we should use the lessons learned in implementing an MTCT
  programme as an engine and a catalyst for the improvement of the health
  care system and primary health care services in general.

In her conclusion, she said:


  One of the unfortunate aspects of the debate on mother-to-child
  transmission of HIV has been a tendency to depict research as a stumbling
  block or an enemy of extended access to care.

Surely, we have a responsibility [Interjections.] ...

In conclusion, I would like to say that we cannot, when we refer to health
being part of women's rights as human rights - which is correct - make
synonymous our misinterpretation of the programme and its assessment.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, it is well to remind ourselves that 90
years ago, that is, in 1912, African and Coloured women from the Free State
came to an all-white and all-male Parliament to make representations
against the laws that oppressed and excluded the African people, and, in
particular, restricted women's movement and economic freedom. Let us then
reflect both on how far we have come, but also on the challenges that still
remain.

I do not wish to inject a sour note into what has generally been a very
happy occasion and an excellent debate. But I must register some concerns.
Firstly, today, with some exceptions, once again, political parties have
left it to women to participate in this very important debate.

Male members have failed to reach even a 33% quota, using only five of the
19 slots. I must congratulate, though, the male speakers who participated.
[Applause.] But, men, you are in some need of empowerment. They are also
invited to go through the door of opened by Dora Tamana.

I also regret the relative absence of members of the executive in the House
today, and want to express appreciation for the presence of Minister Omar,
and Minister Ngubane, who has until just now been with us during the
debate. [Applause.] But where, I must ask, are the party leaders and Chief
Whips? The two women Chief Whips are in Zimbabwe, we know that. But what
business did the others prioritise for March 8? Perhaps, as women, we
should ask that question. Where are those people today, what are they
doing?

Finally, hon members, on behalf of all of us, I congratulate the hon Pregs
Govender on her very well-deserved award. [Applause.] I hope that the
committee she chairs will succeed in its endeavour to educate and mobilise
men to work for the human rights of all members of society. On this day we
salute and greet all those who continue to work to implement the
Constitution we fought so hard to put in place.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 12:37.

     (1)    Final Report of the Election Observation Mission to the 2001
         Presidential, Parliamentary and Local Government Elections in the
         Republic of Zambia:


           As stated in previous statements to the media and stakeholders,
           the SADC Parliamentary Forum Election Observer Mission for the
           2001 Presidential, Parliamentary and Local Government Elections
           were in the Republic of Zambia from 10th - 30th December 2001.


           The Election Observation Mission to Zambia comprised 26 Members
           of Parliament drawn from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
           Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, South Africa, Swaziland and
           Zimbabwe. The coming to Zambia of this Mission was part of the
           SADC Parliamentary Forum's commitment to the struggle for and
           achievement of justice, democracy, gender equality and equity,
           the rule of law, sustainable development and good governance in
           the SADC region.


           The SADC Parliamentary Forum election observation mission's
           mandate was primarily to assess the integrity of the electoral
           process and support the expression of the will of all Zambians
           in the democratic process. As with five other national elections
           that the SADC Parliamentary Forum has observed since 1999, the
           Mission maintained the principle that ultimately, it is the
           constitutional prerogative of the people of Zambia to decide who
           or which party forms the next government of Zambia.


           The Forum's observation programme in Zambia was in five phases,
           namely:
           Voter registration
           Orientation workshop
           Pre-election phase
           Election phase
           Post election phase (declaration of results)


           Upon arrival in Zambia on 10 December 2001, both staff and
           Members of Parliament attended orientation workshop on the socio-
           political, economic situation and electoral systems and
           processes in Zambia. The workshop was aimed at adequately
           briefing Members of Parliament on the obtaining circumstances
           relative to the electoral process. At the end of the orientation
           workshop, the Mission was formally constituted under the
           leadership of the Speaker of the National Assembly of Lesotho,
           Hon. Ntlhoi Motsamai. Hon. Elia Kaiyamo of the National Assembly
           of Namibia was elected deputy mission leader.


           The Mission immediately commenced its work by consulting with
           and receiving briefings from political parties, the Electoral
           Commission of Zambia (ECZ), non-governmental organizations,
           religious leaders, academics and the media among other key
           stakeholders.


           In accordance with established practice, the Mission deployed
           teams in all the nine administrative provinces of Zambia. The
           teams were in the provinces from 14th - 28th December 2001.
           While in the provinces, the teams submitted daily reports of
           their activities and observations to the Mission headquarters in
           Lusaka.


           The team that remained in Lusaka Province comprised Speaker
           Ntlhoi Motsamai of Lesotho (Mission team Leader), Hon. Dr.
           Theresa Cohen of Angola, Hon. Dr. Hassy H.B. Kitine of Tanzania,
           Hon. Aniceto Hamukwaya of Angola and Hon. Lutero Simango of
           Mozambique.


           In addition to its normal observation agenda as it applied to
           other provincial teams, the team took the initiative of further
           consulting with political parties, the Electoral Commission of
           Zambia, non-governmental organizations, relevant government
           authorities and other international observer missions; notably
           the European Union and the Carter Centre.


           At the end of the official designated voting period (27 December
           2001) the provincial teams reconvened in Lusaka and issued an
           interim statement in which the following findings and
           recommendations were made:


              *   The Mission congratulated the people of Zambia for turning
                  out in large numbers, for braving the rain and for voting
                  in the most peaceful and exemplary manner. In spite of
                  the long delays experienced at polling stations in a
                  number of provinces, such as Lusaka and Northern
                  Provinces among others, Zambians demonstrated remarkable
                  patience, tolerance, political maturity and determination
                  to cast their votes even late into the early hours of the
                  next day.


              *   The Mission established that political parties other than
                  the ruling party had either limited access or no access
                  to the public media. The Mission noted with serious
                  concern that the media in Zambia is regrettably, highly
                  polarized and was generally partisan in its coverage of
                  the electoral process. Ideally, the public media should
                  accord all political parties fair and equal coverage.
              *   While acknowledging and appreciating that the fixing of
                  the date of elections in Zambia is the prerogative of the
                  President, a situation that obtains in most Westminster-
                  style constitutions, the Mission regretted the timing of
                  the tripartite elections in Zambia. The Mission noted
                  that as the day fell during the festive and comparatively
                  rainy season, some voters might have been
                  disenfranchised. The Mission was of the view that
                  elections should ideally be held during a period most
                  convenient to the electorate. The Mission recognized
                  however, that notwithstanding the above, the people of
                  Zambia turned out in their large numbers and exercised
                  their constitutional right.


              *   In recognition of the critical importance of elections as
                  the midwife to participatory governance and
                  representative democracy, the Mission was of the view
                  that authorities consider creating a conducive
                  environment for the electorate to exercise the right to
                  vote. To this end, the Mission notes with concern that no
                  official regard was accorded to 27 December as the day of
                  voting - an activity that takes place once in five years.
                  The Mission recommended that the date of voting should be
                  declared a public holiday. This, it was hoped, would
                  allow as many eligible voters as possible to cast their
                  ballots. The congestion and long queues that were
                  experienced during the just-ended tripartite elections
                  could be partly attributed to the fact that some people
                  could only find time to vote after working hours - or
                  some thirty minutes before the closing of polling
                  stations.


              *   Without prejudice to the good work of the Electoral
                  Commission of Zambia, particularly in the pre-election
                  period, the Mission strongly recommended that the
                  Commission overhauls its election management system in
                  order to ensure that the integrity of the process is not
                  compromised. This was especially in view of the fact that
                  in some polling stations, voting could not commence on
                  time or only commenced the following day due to
                  logistical and administrative problems. Some polling
                  stations did not receive election material in time
                  leading to delays in the voting process.


              *   In view of the confusion observed during the casting of
                  ballots in the tripartite elections, it was recommended
                  that where more than one election are held
                  simultaneously, transparent ballot boxes be introduced
                  together with ballot papers of different colours
                  corresponding to the respective ballot boxes. This
                  recommendation was based on lesson learned from the 2000
                  Tanzania general elections. This would not only save time
                  but also reduce the incidence of ballots being cast in
                  the wrong ballot boxes.


              *   Without prejudice to the sterling efforts of various NGOs
                  in educating voters about the electoral process, the
                  Mission noted that, in some cases, voters in the rural
                  areas were not fully aware of the voting procedures. The
                  Mission strongly recommended that the Electoral
                  Commission of Zambia (ECZ) seriously consider taking as
                  one of its primary responsibilities, the education of
                  voters. It was also recommended that as the primary
                  beneficiaries of the electoral process, political parties
                  must engage in voter education. The Mission was of the
                  view that the efforts of NGOs should complement those
                  efforts of the primary stakeholders.


              *   The Mission noted with concern the rather low number of
                  registered voters. According to the 2000 Census results,
                  there are 4,687,997 adults or about 46% of the population
                  in Zambia. However, of that number, at the close of the
                  extended voter registration exercise on 31 July 2001,
                  only 2,604,761 or 56% of eligible citizens had registered
                  to vote. Given the fact that for a variety of reasons not
                  all registered voters normally cast their ballots, the
                  Mission concluded that the voters' roll of 56% of
                  eligible citizens as too low. The Mission also observed
                  that on the eve of voting day and on voting day itself,
                  many voters had still not collected their cards. The
                  Mission noted with appreciation however that the ECZ made
                  arrangements for voters to collect their cards on voting
                  day. Against this background, the Mission recommended
                  that authorities should strive to ensure that the process
                  of applying for a National Registration Card is less
                  cumbersome. In the same breadth, the Mission welcomed the
                  announcement by the ECZ that voter registration would be
                  carried out on a continuous basis, and not only in the
                  period immediately preceding an election.
              *   In view of the rather slow rate at which election results
                  are being released as compared to other elections in the
                  past, the Mission urged the Electoral Commission to
                  expedite the announcement of election results.


              *   At the relevant time, the Mission also congratulated the
                  ECZ and stakeholders for working together in election-
                  related Conflict Management Committees. The Mission was
                  of the view that such Committees were an essential
                  ingredient for a peaceful and participatory electoral
                  process.


           The Mission lamented the slow return and declaration of results,
           particularly those relating to the Presidential poll, which made
           it difficult for the Mission and indeed other international
           observers, to pronounce its position on the integrity of the
           entire electoral process.


           It is against this background that it was agreed that a four-
           member team remains in the country to observe the final phase of
           the electoral process. The decision to leave only a four-member
           team was reached against a background of limited financial
           resources to sustain a large team, but also in view of the fact
           that the task at hand required the mission's presence in the
           capital, Lusaka.


           Thus agreed, the Mission team leader, Hon. Speaker Ntlhoi
           Motsamai of Lesotho, the deputy team leader, Hon. Elia Kaiyamo
           of Namibia, Hon. Lureto C. Simango of Mozambique and Hon. Dr.
           Hassy H.B. Kitine of the United Republic of Tanzania remained in
           the country to assess the final declaration and announcement of
           results.


           In spite of the repeated assurances by the Electoral Commission
           that based established practice since 1962, and in terms of the
           electoral laws, the President-elect and indeed all the new
           Parliamentarians would be known "twenty- four hours after
           voting", the unprecedented delays in the declaration of the
           results impacted negatively on the credibility of the Electoral
           Commission. Notwithstanding the fact that the tripartite
           elections were being conducted for the first time in the
           electoral history of Zambia, the delay in the declaration of the
           results was unacceptable. The delays raised questions about the
           integrity of the process itself and created fertile ground for
           unnecessary suspicions among stakeholders. This problem was
           further aggravated by allegations that some of the results
           announced at the Electoral Commission headquarters were
           different from those counted and verified at polling stations.
           The Commission did not produce proof to disprove of such
           allegations.


           The fact that incoming faxed results from the districts could
           not be monitored as there were data captured by the Electoral
           Commission headquarters by party agents; observers or monitors
           left much to be desired.


           While the counting and announcement of provisional results by
           returning officers could be monitored and verified by party
           agents and observers, there was no monitoring and verification
           at the Electoral Commission headquarters as the results were
           being received from the constituencies.


           There were clear cases of discrepancies between the results
           announced and verified at polling stations and those announced
           by the Commission. The Commission attributed these anomalies
           exclusively to the technical failures of fax machines leading to
           the omission of some figures. However, the mission did not find
           the explanation plausible. In fact, these anomalies raised
           questions as to the prevalence of the anomalies and their
           possible correction.


           As the results trickled in, there was perceived selective
           announcement of results from constituencies widely seen as
           strongholds of the ruling party. This created the impression
           that the results were being unfairly announced to the nation.


           As indicated in the mission's Preliminary Statement issued on 30
           December 2001, up to the level of the announcement of the
           provisional results at the polling station, the mission
           considered the process free and transparent in respect of the
           parliamentary poll.
           However, the painstakingly slow release of results, coupled with
           the apparent lack of effective supervision and transparency
           between the transmission and collation of those results to the
           Commission headquarters, the tabulation and final announcement
           of results, a crisis of confidence in the outcome was created.


           In view of the above, the SADC Parliamentary Forum mission to
           the 2001 Presidential, Parliamentary and Local Government
           elections is of the view that although the elections were
           generally free, the nature of the defects was such that the
           Mission was unable to confirm the accuracy of the results.


           As part of its contribution to strengthening democracy in the
           region, and based on lessons learned and experiences gained in
           observing elections in Mozambique, Namibia, Mauritius, Zimbabwe,
           and Tanzania, the SADC Parliamentary Forum adopted Norms and
           Standards for Elections in the SADC region on 25 March 2001.


           Based on these norms, the mission recommends:


                  Strict adherence to the electoral laws and the provisions
                  of the Constitution.


                  There should be immediate release of official results on
                  completion of counting, signed by returning officers and
                  confirmed by party agents.


                  Verification and reconciliation of ballots should be done
                  before counting begins and this should be done in the
                  presence of candidates and or their agents.


                  The Electoral Commission should prepare and make
                  available a timetable of the electoral process including
                  the acquisition of electoral materials, the packaging and
                  distribution to polling stations. The timetable,
                  including all stages of electoral events should, by law,
                  be made accessible to all stakeholders.


                  Election laws should be reviewed to make it possible for
                  election related disputes to be disposed of before the
                  declaration of the results.


           As stated in the Norms and Standards for Elections in the SADC
           region, parliaments and governments in the region should
           seriously consider adopting and implementing the norms and
           standards in their electoral systems and practices. This "...
           would certainly go a long way in entrenching a democratic
           culture, in minimizing conflict and contributing to political
           stability and peaceful development in Southern Africa." [SADC
           Parliamentary Forum Norms and Standards for Elections in the
           SADC region, 2001.]
