                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms M A MOLEBATSI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the SABC  3's  Special  Assignment  reported  a  financial
       transaction involving trade in  human  body  parts  which  occurs  in
       Johannesburg and other parts of the country;


  (2) wishes to express its disgust at and condemnation of  this  evil  and
       barbaric practice; and


  (3) calls on the people to co-operate with the police to  wipe  out  this
       inhumane practice and to bring the perpetrators to book.

[Applause.]

Mev P W CUPIDO: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met skok en verontwaardiging kennis neem van die venynige aanval deur
       mnr Harold Baxter,  'n  ANC-lid  van  Worcester,  op  die  Afrikaanse
       Christelike Vrouevereniging;


  (2) verder kennis neem dat alhoewel  die  ACVV  Afrikaans  en  Christelik
       georiënteerd is, dit geen persoon op grond van taal, geloof of  kleur
       wegwys nie;


  (3)  ook   kennis   neem   dat   die   bestuurskomitee   van   die   ACVV
       verteenwoordigend van alle Suid-Afrikaners in die Wes-Kaap is en  oor
       die  afgelope  40  jaar  welsynsdienste   aan   voorheen   benadeelde
       gemeenskappe lewer; en


     4) 'n beroep op die ANC doen om, as hulle ernstig is met versoening,
        onverwyld die ACVV en die Afrikaanse kerkgemeenskap onvoorwaardelik
        om verskoning te vra en die betrokke raadslid te dissiplineer.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs P W CUPIDO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and indignation the  vicious  attack  by  Mr  Harold
       Baxter, an ANC councillor of Worcester, on the Afrikaanse Christelike
       Vrouevereniging;
  (2) further notes that, although the  ACVV  is  Afrikaans  and  Christian
       orientated, it does not turn  away  any  person  based  on  language,
       religion or colour;


  (3) also notes that the management committee of the ACVV is
       representative of all South Africans in the Western Cape and for the
       past 40 years has been delivering welfare services to previously
       disadvantaged communities; and


  (4) appeals to the ANC, if they are serious about reconciliation, to
       apologise immediately and unconditionally to the ACVV and the
       Afrikaans church community and to discipline the councillor in
       question.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) applauds the combined effort of the  Scorpions,  police  and  special
       forensic squad in contemplating to crack down  on  lawyers,  doctors,
       some members of the police and tow-truck drivers who defraud the Road
       Accident Fund to the tune of R300 million a year;


  (2) is shocked by the abuse of passenger patients who are rushed to  hand
       over their power of attorney and made to  sign  false  Road  Accident
       Fund claim forms;


  (3) notes that the revenue of this fund is generated from  innocent  road
       users who consciously believe that such a fund is for a  good  cause,
       yet it falls prey to criminal elements; and


  (4) wishes the team investigating the  scam  every  possible  success  in
       their task.

Mrs Z A KOTA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the reports on the burning of a residential building  in
       Johannesburg and the subsequent clampdown on slumlords who let office
       buildings for residential purposes by the city council;


  (2) believes that a lack of adequate housing in our cities provides
       opportunities for unscrupulous landlords to        exploit the poor
       for self-enrichment through illegal means in most instances;


  (3) calls on law-enforcement agencies to seek and arrest these  slumlords
       in Johannesburg and wherever else in  the  country  where  there  are
       similar transgressions;


  (4) appeals to the public to co-operate  with  these  law   enforcers  in
       bringing the perpetrators to book; and


  (5) calls upon local councils to develop policies and  mechanisms to
       ensure that blocks of flats in the inner cities are safe and
       sufficiently habitable.

[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Chairman, I hereby give notice that I shall move on behalf  of
the New NP:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the New NP encourages the fiscal discipline exercised by the South
       African Government and considers it a key component in the positive
       sentiment, which contributes a great deal to the current resurgence
       of the rand/dollar exchange rate, presently publicised towards South
       Africa;


  (2) to date the rand proved to be the best performing currency over the
       past six months against the dollar, appreciating against the dollar
       to a five-month best level on 6 May 2002, ie R10,2944; and


  (3) coupled with an increase in Sacob's business confidence index, there
       is definitely a positive outlook for future economic growth.

[Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Chair, I give notice that I shall move at the  next  sitting  of
the House:


  That the House -
  (1) notes the astronomical rise in food and maize prices in famine-hit
       Southern Africa;


  (2) further notes the recent report by the Food and  Agriculture
       Organisation, a United Nations Agency, which  identified Zimbabwe and
       Zambia as the worst-hit countries;


  (3) expresses its deep concern that we only have maize  supplies
       sufficient for three months' domestic consumption;


  (4) calls on all respective parties to urgently extend a  helping hand to
       each other during the upcoming meeting between SA, its neighbouring
       countries and the UN agencies in order to minimise both short-term
       and long-term effects of starvation; and


  (5) calls on the Government to consider measures contributing to
       affordable maize products for our nation.

Ms M M SOTYU: Chair, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the Deloitte and Touche report that white-collar crime,
       dominated by money laundering, costs South Africa between R35 and R40
       billion in 1996;


  (2) reiterates the Government's commitment to stamp out crime and
       corruption; and


  (3) calls on the people to work with the law-enforcement officers to
       stamp out crime and corruption.

[Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chair, I give notice that I shall move  on  behalf  of  the
UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) urges its members to gird their loins in preparation for the World
       Summit on Sustainable Development due to be held in Johannesburg
       later this year;


  (2) wakes up to the fact that the United Nations agencies are not keen to
       make technical support available and that South Africa and other
       developing nations should not tire of lobbying for support for the
       solution of socioeconomic problems such as the eradication of poverty
       and the provision of sanitation within the region;


  (3) challenges the international community not to confine the summit to
       issues around the environment only; and


  (4) calls on other African countries, in the spirit of self-reliance, or
       Vukuzenzele, to buy into this venture as a way leading to the
       envisaged African Union.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairman, I give notice that at the next sitting of the
House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Kingdom of Lesotho will hold national elections on 25 May
           2002;


       (b)  several parties are taking part in these elections under a new
           constitution which provides for 80 constituency representatives
           and 40 proportional seats; and


       (c)  the PAC has visited all major political parties in Lesotho, who
           all hold that South Africa is their most important neighbour and
           must play an impartial role so that Lesotho's politics can
           stabilise their country, especially following the military
           intervention of SADC led by South Africa; and


  (2) therefore believes that in order for our country to be seen not to be
       interfering in the internal affairs of Lesotho, all reported visits
       to Lesotho by the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, the
       Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry and the Minister of Foreign
       Affairs be postponed until after the Lesotho elections.

Mr L V J NGCULU: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern and disapproval the incident of a pregnant woman
       who was forced to give birth to her baby after being denied attention
       at a hospital in Khayelitsha;


  (2) believes that all South Africans have a constitutional right to
       quality health care and human dignity;


  (3) further believes that all civil servants have an obligation to uphold
       the principle of Batho Pele and that acts of this nature diminish the
       image of the noble nursing profession in the eyes of the public;


  (4) commends the police for the assistance rendered to the mother and the
       baby; and


  (5) condemns without reservation all those responsible for this inhumane
       act.
[Applause.]

Mnr A J BOTHA: Ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die volgende sittingsdag  sal
voorstel:


  Dat die Huis:


  (1) kennis neem van die ANC se siniese plan om vakante
       ambassadeursposte, sonder beginsel of meriete, aan te wend as 'n
       vangnet vir Nuwe NP-lede in die Parlement;


  (2) sy afkeur duidelik uitspreek oor die beskadiging van Suid-Afrika se
       buitelandse beeld deur hierdie opportunistiese misbruik en die najaag
       van matelose magshonger;


  (3) daarop let dat die spitsberaad oor morele regenerasie 'n skandalige
       vermorsing van openbare fondse was, omdat die regerende party sy mag
       opportunisties misbruik om verkose openbare verteenwoordigers om te
       koop om hulle grondwetlike onderneming te verraai vir persoonlike
       voordeel; en


  (4) die ANC aanmaan om nie Suid-Afrikaanse ambassades en missies in te
       rig net vir meer sitplekke op die soustrein vir daardie mense nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A J BOTHA: I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day I shall
move:


  That the House:


  (1) notes the ANC's cynical plan to utilise vacant ambassadorial posts,
       without principle or merit, as a net with which to catch New NP
       members in Parliament;


  (2) clearly expresses its censure about the damaging of South Africa's
       image abroad by this opportunistic abuse and the pursuit of an
       excessive appetite for power;


  (3) notes that the summit on moral regeneration was a shameful waste of
       public funds, because the governing party is opportunistically
       abusing its power to bribe elected public representatives to betray
       their constitutional undertaking for personal gain; and


  (4) urges the ANC not to equip South African embassies and missions
       simply for more seats on the gravy train for those people.

[Interjections.]]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Chair, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) acknowledges with satisfaction that the National Lottery Fund is to
       increase the funding of social projects to R1,2 billion; and


  (2) thanks the Minister of Trade and Industry and also expresses the hope
       that this House will be kept informed as to how and to whom these
       funds are allocated.

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Chair, I give notice that on the next siting day of the
House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House –


  (1) notes that Minister of Minerals and Energy, the hon Phumzile Mlambo-
       Ngcuka, announced that the liquid and fuels industry performance in
       achieving black economic development targets will be subjected to a
       system of recognition, incentives and penalties;


  (2) believes that this reflects commitment by the Government to transform
       this sector to be representative of the country's demographics;


  (3) welcomes the announcement by the Minister; and


  (4) calls on all stakeholders to co-operate with the Government in
       realising the objectives of black economic empowerment in this
       sector.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! It seems to  me  that  we  have
time for two more motions - am I right? [Interjections.]
Mnr J W LE ROUX: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die volgende
sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) uiters besorg is oor die hoë vlakke van besoedeling in die algemeen
       en plastieksakbesoedeling in die besonder;


  (2) alle pogings sal steun om plastieksakbesoedeling teen te werk;


  (3) opvoeding, hersirkulering en effektiewe afvalbestuur aanmoedig om
       deel te vorm van die oplossing vir hierdie ernstige probleem;


  (4) dit verblydend vind dat die Regering wéér met die vervaardigers en
       gebruikers van dun plastieksakke in gesprek tree; en


     5) die vasstelling van 'n wen-wen-oplossing aanmoedig wat tot gevolg
        sal hê dat plastieksakbesoedeling gestaak word en dat die
        vervaardigingsektor as werkverskaffer nie ernstig benadeel word nie.


(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) is extremely concerned at the high levels of pollution in general and
       plastic bag pollution in particular;


  (2) will support all efforts to counter plastic bag pollution;


  (3) encourages education, recycling and effective waste management to
       form part of the solution to this serious problem;


  (4) finds it heartening that the Government is once again engaged in
       talks with the producers and consumers of thin plastic bags; and


  (5) encourages the establishment of a win-win solution which will result
       in an end to plastic bag pollution without the production sector as
       employer being seriously prejudiced.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chair, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting of the
House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the continuing struggle to survive by Noupoort patients
       following another report that three patients were brutally assaulted;


  (2) supports the Minister of Social Development in his calls to close
       down this institution;


  (3) expresses the hope that the Minister will effectively deal with
       similar institutions which violate basic human rights; and


  (4) further calls on the Government to protect the human rights of all
       citizens of this country to demonstrate that never again will we
       tolerate human rights abuse in this country, no matter what the
       circumstances.

[Applause.]

Miss M N BUTHELEZI: Chair, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House –


  (1) notes that:


       (a)  Minister Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka announced a comprehensive mining
           review by the mine inspectorate throughout 2002 to  curb  mining
           accidents; and


       (b)  whilst the loss of lives in South  Africa's  mining  sector  has
           been higher than in other major mining areas of the  world,  the
           number of deaths in South Africa's mining industry has  declined
           since the introduction of the Mine  Health  and  Safety  Act  of
           1996;


  (2) welcomes the announcement made by the Minister; and


  (3) calls on mine bosses to co-operate with the Government to ensure that
       mines are safe workplaces for workers.

[Applause.]

Mnr C H F GREYLING: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek wil net weet of dit in orde en
parlementêr is vir 'n lid van hierdie Raad om te sê dat ander lede van
hierdie Raad omgekoop is om in sekere poste te dien - soos wat die agb
Andries Botha gesê het.

Mnr D V BLOEM: Dis 'n skande, Andries! Skande! (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C H F GREYLING: Chairperson, I would just like to know whether it is in
order and parliamentary for a member of this House to say that other
members of this House were bribed to serve in certain positions - as the
hon Andries Botha said.

Mr D V BLOEM: It is a disgrace, Andries! A disgrace!]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! As far as we can make out, the
reference was to political parties. But I will double-check the Hansard to
see whether any reference was made to any individual member of this House.

If the remark was made to the member, then that would be unacceptable and
unparliamentary. But if it was a reference to the political party as a
whole, then that will pass muster. Let me have a look at the Hansard and
come back to you on that.

                          AIRPLANE CRASH IN NIGERIA

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness the tragic airplane crash in Kano, Nigeria, on
       Sunday, 5 May 2002, which claimed 148 lives;


  (2) further notes that amongst the casualties was Nigeria's  Minister  of
       Sport, Ishaya Mark Aku;


  (3) mourns with the people of Nigeria; and


  (4) sends its heartfelt condolences to the Nigerian  Parliament  and  the
       people, and to those who lost loved ones in this tragedy.

Agreed to.

The House adjourned at 17:18.
