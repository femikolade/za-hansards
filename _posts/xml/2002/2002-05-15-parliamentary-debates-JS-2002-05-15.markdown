                        PROCEEDINGS AT JOINT SITTING
                                    ____

Members of the National Assembly  and  the  National  Council  of  Provinces
assembled in the Chamber of the National Assembly at 14:09.

The Speaker took the Chair and requested members  to  observe  a  moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

                  WELCOME TO HIS HIGHNESS THE AMIR OF QATAR

The SPEAKER: Hon members, we are honoured to welcome amongst  us  today  His
Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the Amir of Qatar, who has  been
invited to address this Joint Sitting. I call upon the  hon  Mr  Ebrahim  to
introduce His Highness. [Applause.]

Mr E I EBRAHIM: Madam Speaker, His Highness Sheikh  Hamad  Bin  Khalifa  Al-
Thani, President Mbeki, Deputy President Zuma,  members  of  the  delegation
accompanying His Highness, hon members of Parliament, distinguished  guests,
and ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure today to introduce  and
welcome to this assembly His Highness Sheikh  Hamad  Bin  Khalifa  Al-Thani,
the Amir of the state of Qatar.

Assalaamu-alai-kum-wa-rahmatullahi-wa-barakatu. [May  Allah's  peace,  mercy
and blessings be upon you.]

His Highness the Amir is the first head of an Arab Gulf state to  visit  our
country. [Applause.] His Highness is the  current  chairperson  of  the  55-
member Organisation of Islamic Conference, and, next year, he will take  the
chair of the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council.

South Africa is, as hon members know, the current chair  of  the  Nonaligned
Movement, and will later be a member of its troika. As chairs of  these  two
emerging political blocs, we have much to compare and discuss.

This state visit by His Highness, we believe, will  further  strengthen  our
bilateral relations, and increase political and economic ties  with  members
of the Gulf Co-operation Council and our interaction with  the  Organisation
of Islamic Conference.

Both our countries are deeply concerned about the current  conflict  in  the
Middle East, and both our  countries  and  the  organisations  we  lead  are
committed to finding a just and lasting solution to the  Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and the creation of a free and independent Palestinian state.

Our economic ties with the state of Qatar have increased over the  years.  A
bilateral Air Service Agreement and a Defence  Co-operation  Agreement  have
already been concluded between South Africa and the state of  Qatar.  Qatar,
which is a  source  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  recently  signed  an
agreement with Sasol to use Sasol technology to  convert  natural  gas  into
liquid fuel.

I would like to tell His Highness that his visit to our country takes  place
at a time when Africa is looking to the future with great optimism.  African
countries are not only moving towards the formation  of  an  African  Union,
but our continent  has  also  unfolded  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development, Nepad. The political and economic support of  Qatar  and  other
Gulf states for the implementation of the  development  project  Nepad  will
contribute greatly towards its success.

His Highness the Amir has a  distinguished  military  career.  He  graduated
from the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst, and joined  the  Qatari  Armed
Forces and was eventually  appointed  Commander-in-Chief  of  the  army.  In
1977, he also, in addition, became the Minister of Defence in Qatar.

His Highness devoted much attention to youth and sporting activities in  the
firm conviction that these activities form a vital part in  the  process  of
nation-building. He established the  first  Military  Sporting  Association,
which  received  membership   of   the   International   Military   Sporting
Association.

His Highness the Amir was awarded numerous decorations by various  countries
for his efforts to boost bilateral  relations  and  promote  peace  and  co-
operation among nations. I counted  over  21  decorations,  among  them  the
Medal of Jose Marte from Cuba. [Applause.]

I welcome him on behalf of the members  of  Parliament  and  the  people  of
South Africa.

Ahlan wa sahlan min Janub Afriqiya. [Welcome to South Africa.] [Applause.]

                 [ADDRESS BY HIS HIGHNESS THE AMIR OF QATAR

Sheikh  HAMAD  BIN  KHALIFA  AL-THANI:  In  The  Name  of  God,   The   Most
Compassionate, The Most Merciful: Madam Speaker, hon members of  Parliament,
ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my happiness at  being present  here
today to address you from this momentous platform, the pillar  of  democracy
in your friendly country.

I take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of myself  and  the  people  of
the state of  Qatar,  greetings  of  appreciation  and  admiration  for  the
struggle and heroic steadfastness of  your  people  against  the  policy  of
apartheid  and  all  forms  of  repression  and  oppression  in   unyielding
determination and firm resolve with no compromise until they achieved  their
freedom. And here your country is today enjoying the fruits of its  struggle
and  its  complete  national  rights,  thereby  earning  the   respect   and
admiration of the international community.

Today you have another colossal task, which is to improve  the  standard  of
living  of  your  people.  We  have  total   confidence   that   with   your
determination,  will  and  resolve,  you  are  fully  able  to  attain  that
objective and confront the challenges, more so because you have  chosen  the
path of democracy as a style of governance, which  is  a  wise  and  correct
choice.

As you know, democracy is a human  legacy,  inherited  by  the  nations  and
entrenched by human experiences in terms  of  responsible  participation  in
the decision-making which it represents, comprising the  building  of  state
institutions,  abiding  by  the  rule  of  law  and  monitoring   government
performance. It has become the  ideal  way  of  establishing  a  secure  and
stable society and the best style to achieve development.

Because we in Qatar, the leadership and the masses, believe in these  maxims
and principles, we have taken promising steps to guarantee  the  responsible
freedom of expression and chosen with full conviction popular  participation
as a political course based on the teachings of our  true  Islamic  religion
and emulating firmly established democratic experiences.

There is another important matter that I find necessary to emphasise; it  is
the need to consecrate the foundations of balance, justice,  mutual  respect
and  refraining  from  double  standards  in  dealings  on  the   front   of
international relations, with adherence  to  international  legitimacy,  its
conventions and  affirmation  of  national  and  political  rights  for  all
peoples and societies as well as their right to  live  in  freedom,  dignity
and sovereignty over their lands without  resorting  to  force,  occupation,
violence or coercion. It is through these principles  that  it  will  become
possible for us  to  construct  an  international  community  based  on  the
pillars of international law, legitimacy and  mutual  interests  and  combat
all repugnant phenomena such as extremism,  terrorism  and  violence  whilst
eradicating its roots and causes.

From this perspective our foreign policy is based on mutual respect,  common
interests, ties of good neighbourliness,  noninterference  in  the  internal
affairs of other countries and  the  necessity  of  settling  conflicts  and
disputes between countries through peaceful and  diplomatic  means,  through
direct negotiations or reference to international arbitration.

Today  the  Palestinians  are  exposed  to  the  most  horrific   forms   of
subjugation and oppression. Here I cannot  but  commend  Archbishop  Desmond
Tutu, who said, and I quote:


  The Palestinians are facing today what we black people  in  South  Africa
  were subjected to during the hegemony of the apartheid government.

[Applause.] I regard it as a duty to laud  the  positive  position  of  your
friendly country in assisting the just cause of the Palestinian people.

Peace and security in the Middle East have their demands; they can  only  be
achieved by the implementation of the resolutions of international  legality
and the Palestinian people regaining their complete national and  legitimate
rights,  foremost  of  which   is   their   right   to   self-determination,
establishing their independent state on their national soil  with  Jerusalem
as its capital ... [Applause] ... as well as the withdrawal of  Israel  from
all the Arab lands it occupied in 1967.

While we condemn terrorism in all  its  forms  and  guises,  whatsoever  its
source  and  wherever  it  occurs,  be  it  state  terrorism  or   that   of
organisations or  individuals,  it  is  incumbent  on  us  to  differentiate
between terrorism, which  is  condemned  and  rejected,  and  the  right  of
peoples to self-determination,  ridding  themselves  of  the  domination  of
foreign occupation, and  their  defence  of  their  homelands  and  dignity,
because that is a right recognised by  and  enshrined  in  all  and  by  all
charters and international laws.

When any person's life becomes worse than death, then he will choose  death.
And if he must die, he will endeavour to take with him  the  one  who  drove
him to death. This is what Israel is doing to the Palestinians and  this  is
their response to her.

The people and government of the state of Qatar are striving to promote  and
develop our ties with your  friendly  country  in  all  spheres,  especially
those of the economy, investment, industry and  science.  The  opportunities
of joint co-operation are numerous and its doors are open. I  hope  that  my
visit will contribute to enhancing the  fruitful  co-operation  between  our
two countries.

I thank you for your attention and I wish  for  your  friendly  country  and
people continued progress and  prosperity.  May  the  peace  the  mercy  and
blessings of God be upon you. [Applause.]]

                               VOTE OF THANKS
Ms J L KGOALI: Madam Speaker, His Excellency the Amir,  His  Excellency  the
President of the Republic of South Africa and the hon the  Deputy  President
of South Africa, I am deeply honoured to  pass  a  vote  of  thanks  on  the
occasion of the historic visit of His  Excellency,  Amir  Sheikh  Hamad  Bin
Khalifa Al-Thani, to our country and Parliament.

I am sure His Excellency is convinced  that  South  Africa  is  not  just  a
beautiful country, but is also a country that is striving  to  do  the  best
for its people and its neighbours.

The state of Qatar became fully independent on 1 September  1971.  Qatar  is
one of the most affluent  countries  in  the  Gulf  region  because  of  its
natural gas and crude oil resources. In November  2000,  Qatar  assumed  the
chair of the Organisation of Islamic Conference for two  years  and,  whilst
South Africa is the chair of the  Nonaligned  Movement,  Qatar  will  be  an
important interpolator  in  the  Middle  Eastern  process  and  the  matters
affecting relationships between the two regions.

Since the hon Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani has come to power  in  1985,
he has moved rapidly to prepare the ground for political  change.  The  past
seven years  have  seen  the  holding  of  three  municipal  elections  with
universal adult suffrage  and  the  announcement  of  plans  to  move  to  a
democratic structure.

South Africa and Qatar share  an  ever-increasing  range  of  interests  and
contacts. Qatar is one of South Africa's leading trade partners in the  Gulf
region. Major companies continue  to  establish  subsidiaries  in  the  Gulf
region, and there are now over 10 000 South African experts working  in  the
technical and medical fields in the region.

Qatar's strategic significance stems not just from its geographic  position,
but also from  its  rapid  modernisation  and  growing  economy  which  will
reposition it in the world  stage.  The  visit  by  His  Excellency,  Sheikh
Hamad, reflects his commitment to promote further progress  in  a  range  of
economic, security and political issues, and  to  continue  to  explore  new
avenues of co-operation.
We thank him and his entourage for visiting this country. [Applause.]

The Speaker adjourned the Joint Sitting at 14:27.
