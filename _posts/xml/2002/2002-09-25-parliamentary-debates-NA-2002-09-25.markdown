ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 0000.

                                ANNOUNCEMENT

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! I wish to announce
that, due to unexpected developments in the Burundi peace process, the
Deputy President is not able to attend today's sitting to answer questions.
He has requested me to convey his apologies to the House for any
inconvenience that this may cause. The impact on the parliamentary
programme will be discussed at tomorrow's meeting of the programme
committee.

Order! We now come to notices of motion.

Ms E THABETHE: Chairperson, in terms of the agreement regarding
programming, and according to the Order Paper, we should start with the
statement by the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, followed by
the questions and thereafter the motions. That is how we understand the
Order Paper.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: One moment, let me just consult.

Order! Since there is an agreement, we will take the statement, but
immediately after the statement, we will take the notices of motion in
order to meet the three o'clock deadline to begin the questions. Is that
agreed to?

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, I am not sure if this matter was fully discussed
at the Chief Whip's Forum this morning, but quite frankly, I do not
understand why we cannot take motions first, which is a customary
procedure, except when questions are on the Order Paper. There are
questions on the Order Paper, but that is only for three o'clock this
afternoon. I believe it will be in the interest of Parliament if we start
with motions this afternoon.

Ms E THABETHE: Chairperson, our understanding is that questions take
precedence every Wednesday, but today, based on the agreement reached, we
must deal with the statement first, thereafter questions and thereafter
motions as the scheduled procedure of this House.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Thabethe, the point is that when
we start at three o'clock, indeed, questions do then take precedence.
Today, however, we are starting at two o'clock, and there is no agreement.
If there was an agreement, the Chair would have been bound to observe the
agreement. What we will then do is: We can begin with the statement and
take the notices immediately after, or as Mr Ellis is suggesting, we can
begin with the notices of motion and then take the statement.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, may I draw your attention to the programme,
which I think all parties were party to, that was produced at the Chief
Whip's Forum this morning. It states quite clearly that at two o'clock the
first order of the day is notices of motion.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Then I would like to rule that we
take the notices of motion. Because it is accordingly printed on the
document which I have in front of me, I am going to take the notices of
motion.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr L J MODISENYANE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  reports that troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Rwanda are pulling
           out of the Democratic Republic of Congo; and


       (b)  that this is a result of months of negotiations aimed at ending
           the war in the country;


  (2) believes that peace and security are important preconditions for
       economic prosperity on the African continent;


  (3) welcomes the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Democratic
       Republic of Congo; and


  (4) urges the people of the Congo to strengthen the peace processes in
       the country and in the region.

Mr A J BOTHA: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Mbeki's refusal to support the expulsion of
       Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth puts Nepad at risk;

[Interjections.]


  (2) further notes that, if a government which replaces the rule of law
       with a reign of terror is welcome in the Commonwealth, then the
       Commonwealth itself loses its integrity and international respect;


  (3) recognises that Nepad is being subverted by President Mbeki's
       apologetic approach to the Mugabe regime; and


  (4) calls on President Mbeki to put the interests of the Southern African
       region and the suffering majority of Zimbabweans ahead of his
       personal and party obligations, and to support principled action
       against the Zanu-PF.
[Applause.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Prince N E ZULU: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) applauds the SABC's channel three for its Heritage Day Celebration of
       the Anglo-Boer war on their screen with all the passion and pain
       these two nations endured before they became what they are now;


  (2) congratulates the South African nation for being bold enough to bring
       these matters to the fore, not in hate, but in a spirit of
       remembrance and commemoration in order to heal the wounds of the
       past; and


  (3) calls on those who are at the pinnacle of power to accept the
       challenge of our recent past, repent and reconcile honestly and
       truthfully.

Mr G P MNGOMEZULU: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that 213 young Israeli democrats have refused to serve in what
           they termed ``an army of occupation"; and


       (b)  483 reserve officers and soldiers have signed a ``refusenik
           petition";


  (2) believes that this reflects a growing desire by the Israeli democrats
       for a realisation of the goal of  peaceful  coexistence  between  the
       state of Israel and the establishment of an independent and sovereign
       state of Palestine;


  (3) commends these brave young Israeli democrats  for  raising  high  the
       flag of peace amidst the ever-increasing  tide  of  Israeli  military
       aggression against the people of Palestine; and


  (4) reiterates its long-held view that a lasting solution to this crisis
       lies in peaceful negotiations, conducted in line with United Nations
       resolutions.

Mev M E OLCKERS: Mnr die Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek by die
volgende sitting van die Huis namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis kennis neem dat -


  (1) die Nuwe NP hom ten sterkste uitspreek teen die beoogde daaglikse
       loterytrekking wat deur die Loteryraad goedgekeur is;


  (2) groter loterybedrywighede geensins sal bydra om die las van die armes
       in die land te verlig nie;
  (3) die droom van Suid-Afrikaners vir beter lewensomstandighede nie gebou
       moet word op die waag van 'n kans nie, maar deur die daarstelling van
       werklike welvaartskepping deur buitelandse investering en groter
       werkskeppingsprogramme; en


     4) die jongste poging om meer geld te bekom nie die onvermoÃ« van die
        Nasionale Loteryraad sal verbeter ten einde te sorg dat die geld by
        bedoelde teikengroepe uitkom nie, maar moontlik nog 'n stukkie brood
        uit 'n honger kind se mond gaan haal omdat die geld vir brood en
        melk nou daagliks weggedobbel gaan word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs M E OLCKERS: Mr Chairperson, I give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the New NP strongly opposes the envisaged daily lottery draw approved
       by the Lottery Board;


  (2) more extensive lottery activities will in no way contribute to
       relieving the burden on the poor in the country;


  (3) the dream of better living conditions for South Africans should not
       be built on the basis of a gamble, but on the creation of real
       prosperity by means of foreign investment and greater job-creation
       programmes; and


  (4) the latest attempt to obtain more funds will not improve the
       inability of the national Lottery Board to ensure that the money
       reaches the target groups it was meant for, but would possibly only
       take another piece of bread from the mouth of a hungry child because
       the bread and milk money will now be gambled away daily.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) acknowledges that the National Lottery was instituted with the
       understanding that funding generated in this fashion would go towards
       worthy causes that focus upon uplifting the poor and disadvantaged;


  (2) condemns the slow pace of distribution of funds from the National
       Lottery to worthy causes;


  (3) in light of the above, rejects the planned institution of daily
       draws, given the probable impact on the poorest of the poor and the
       absence of proper research into the socioeconomic impact of daily
       draws; and


  (4) calls upon the Government to immediately intervene to ensure that
       distribution is speeded up and expanded, and to prevent the
       institution of daily draws that will only impoverish the poor.

Ms M C LOBE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  President George Bush of the United States of America will visit
           South Africa early next year; and


       (b)  this visit follows an endorsement of  the  New  Partnership  for
           Africa's Development by the United Nations General Assembly;


  (2) believes that this  visit  represents  another  breakthrough  in  the
       successes made in mobilising international support for Nepad and  the
       rebirth of the African continent; and
  (3) welcomes the plan by the President of the United States to visit
       South Africa.

Rev K R J MESHOE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock that President Mbeki and the Nigerian President
       Obasanjo decided to defend and protect Zimbabwean President Robert
       Mugabe when it was proposed that Zimbabwe be expelled from the
       Commonwealth for causing pain and suffering in his country;


  (2) further notes that by giving Mr Mugabe yet another six months, his
       unacceptable behaviour is endorsed, he and his supporters are allowed
       to continue undermining the rule of law, and the suffering that is
       already experienced by many in that country is perpetuated;

[Interjections.]


  (3) believes that President Mbeki's refusal to endorse Zimbabwe's
       expulsion means the actions of a regime that conducts a systematic
       reign of terror is condoned, which also puts Nepad at risk;

[Interjections.]


  (4) fails to understand why the two African Presidents would believe that
       a man who undermines the Commonwealth and democratic principles, like
       Mr Mugabe does, can restore democracy in his country;

[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!


  (5) agrees with comments by the editor of The Citizen, who said that ``if
       Mbeki and Obasanjo cannot be relied upon to uphold human rights in
       the Commonwealth ...''
[Time expired.] [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mr L N DIALE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Israeli army continues to occupy Palestinian territories;


       (b)  President Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority and his
           colleagues are reported to have been trapped in their
           headquarters in Ramallah as a result of this latest round of
           occupation; and


       (c)  this has effectively denied President Arafat and his colleagues
           freedom of movement and has been condemned by the international
           community;
  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the continuation of the military onslaught against the people of
           Palestine only fuels war and instability in the Middle East
           region; and


       (b)  the resolution of this conflict lies in peaceful negotiations;
           and


  (3) calls on -


       (a)  the Israeli troops to withdraw from Palestinian territories; and


       (b)  leaders in the Middle East to work towards the peaceful
           resolution of the Middle East conflict.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C M LOWE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes with unease the storm-trooper  tactics  of  the  ANC  in  their
       campaign of harassment and intimidation against the DA during the by-
       election in Claremont, Durban;


  (2) further notes that ANC mobs -


       (a)  blocked a street to prevent a DA motorcade from passing;


       (b)  ordered a DA canvasser to appear before a kangaroo disciplinary
           committee; and


       (c)  refused a DA canvasser access to certain streets;


  (3) recognises that the ANC's commitment to democracy vanishes when it
       starts to lose support; and

[Interjections.]


  (4) believes that the ANC's tactics are a  portent  of  worse  things  to
       come.

[Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mrs I MARS: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the fire that gutted four carriages of a commuter train at
       New Canada Station between Johannesburg and Soweto, might have been
       the result of an act of arson;


  (2) further notes that, according to an official of the SA Police
       Service, a commuter allegedly approached the control room at Park
       Station and warned that he intended to start a fire, but he was not
       taken seriously;


  (3) hopes that, if arson was the cause of the fire, the person
       responsible is arrested and brought to book; and


  (4) urges people with any information about the cause of the fire to
       assist the authorities in their investigations.

Mr R P ZONDO: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Minister of Safety and Security, Charles Nqakula, released
           statistics on crime recently; and


       (b)  these statistics revealed that motor vehicle hijacking, cash-in-
           transit robbery and bank robbery have declined by 18% over the
           past four years and that crime is stabilising;


  (2) believes that this reflects the commitment and successes by the ANC-
       led government in fighting crime and building safe and secure
       communities; and


  (3) commends the Government for bringing down the levels of crime in the
       country.

Mr D M BAKKER: Mr Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the parlous state of security at our courts which
       has led to a number of lawless security lapses, and which is damaging
       to the rule of law and the administration of justice;


  (2) accordingly draws the attention of the Minister for Justice and
       Constitutional Development to the following recent incidents, namely
       -


       (a)  the escape from the Cape Supreme Court's holding cells by Pagad
           member Ebrahim Jeneker and two fellow accused last Thursday -
           being the second such escape by Jeneker;


       (b)  the shooting incident last week at a magistrate's court in the
           Eastern Cape in which an accused and a witness were killed; and


       (c)  recent assassinations and assassination attempts perpetrated
           against magistrates hearing gang-related cases; and


  (3) therefore calls on the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
       Development, as a matter of urgency, to take immediate steps to beef
       up security at our courts and regarding judicial officers, including
       the allocation of adequate resources and the prosecution of corrupt
       officials.

The Chief Whip of the Majority Party moved without notice:

Agreed to.

                   WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Thank you very much,
Chairperson and hon members. The Johannesburg World Summit was the biggest
United Nations conference ever held. It was attended by 1700 official
delegates to the UN segment, including 105 heads of state in government.
Altogether 180 countries were officially represented at the World Summit,
and in addition 500 parallel events took place in Johannesburg and
elsewhere in the country.

It is estimated that the total number of international delegates attending
the World Summit and the range of parallel events was in the region of 37
000 people. In our view the World Summit on Sustainable Development has
opened the way for the world to take new strides in the foremost challenges
of our time - the eradication of poverty and the closing of the gap between
the rich and the poor, combined with the protection of the environment.

What mattered as representatives of over 180 countries grappled with the
whole range of complex and interrelated issues, was that there should, at
the end of it all, be a critical mass of agreement on a new agenda for
practical action that could decisively alter the global framework for
sustainable development.

The World Summit constituted a huge victory for human development and for
the environment. It fulfilled a number of key objectives. Firstly, the
World Summit created the correct balance between the three pillars of
sustainable development, that is, social development, economic growth and
the protection of the environment. This is a decisive shift from the
predominantly wrong perspective over the past decade that sustainable
development equals the protection of the environment.

Secondly, the World Summit emphatically pronounced that sustainable
development cannot be achieved separately from the quest to eradicate
poverty, and that the growing gap between the rich and the poor is one of
the biggest threats to sustainable development. Among the decisions in this
regard was the decision to establish a world poverty fund.

Thirdly, the World Summit introduced a major shift from the donor-recipient
paradigm to one which focuses on the obstacles to economic growth in poor
countries, posed by the unfair global economic system. While there is
agreement to increase aid from rich to poor countries, there is, more
importantly, an acknowledgement that by far the biggest obstacle to poverty
eradication is a lack of market access and an antipoor trade system.

Fourthly, the cause of the African continent was greatly advanced with the
practical focus on Nepad.

Fifthly, sustainable development is now recognised as being everybody's
business. There was high-level involvement in the summit and the summit-
related activities of the private sector, the trade union movement which,
incidentally, held its biggest ever conference on matters related to
sustainable development and the environment in Johannesburg, the courts
with the conference of the judges, Parliament, youth, women, local
government and religious institutions.

In the sixth place, the World Summit served to advance the course of
multilateralism during this troubled time in the world. It has asserted the
centrality of the United Nations and called for democratic global
governance. The summit brought global focus on the state of the environment
and a renewed high level of commitment to environmental protection.

The Johannesburg plan of action which was adopted by consensus, includes
programmes to deliver water, energy, health care, agricultural development
and a better environment. The new targets that have been set in this plan
will have an enormous impact on the global agenda. In addition to the
already agreed upon target of halving the number of people living in
poverty by 2015, there was a particular focus on each of the details of the
millennium development goals, for example, the goal to halve the number of
people without access to drinking water.

New targets then included a decision to halve the number of people without
access to basic sanitation by the year 2015. Countries also agreed to
reverse the trend in bio-diversity loss by 2010, and to restore collapsed
fish stocks by 2015. It was also agreed that chemicals which have an
adverse effect on the human health and the environment should be phased out
by 2020. And then there was an important agreement that energy services be
extended with access to energy being granted to 35% of African households
within 20 years.

We believe that the Johannesburg World Summit shifted the focus of world
leaders from policy debates to the task of making it happen and achieving
high-level commitments by heads of states and leaders from all walks of
life. As testimony to this many concrete actions, partnerships and funding
targets were announced by countries and stakeholders. Over 300 partnerships
were launched. These include 32 energy initiatives, 21 water programmes and
32 programmes on bio-diversity and eco-system management.

It is my pleasure to note that the South African Parliament played an
instrumental role in the WSSD. The extraordinary meeting of the
interparliamentary union that was attended by an official multiparty
delegation of 25 members from this Parliament, and the workshop on clean
air and clean water facilitated by Parliamentarians for Global Action, co-
hosted by our own Cabinet Ministers, are events that contributed
significantly to the final success.

The parliamentary workshop on clean air and clean water, for example, was a
unique forum that brought together members of parliament from over 100
countries, including our own, of course, with leading environmental
experts, NGOs and business leaders, to highlight the success of legislation
aimed at reducing air and water pollution and illustrate the potential to
implement similar actions internationally.

Members of Parliament also played a prominent role in the global civil
society forum. Government is in the process of developing a detailed
response to the Johannesburg decisions. It has already been decided that
all Government departments are to integrate the Johannesburg plan of
implementation into the work of their departments. It is Government's view
that sustainable development should not be regarded as an add-on, but that
it should be an organic part of what we do. We must avoid the danger of
making sustainable development the responsibility of just one organ of
state. Sustainable development is really about integrated government.

Research was commissioned by Government and conducted by the Bureau of
Market Research based at the University of South Africa, Iqwa Structured
Financial Products and economists from Urban Icon, and the economic impact
of WSSD has, on a preliminary basis, been assessed. Government's investment
in the WSSD amounted to about R449 million. This includes funding from all
three spheres of Government. The leverage effect of Government's
contribution from the private sector amounted to about R620 million, of
which 60% came from international sponsors and donor agencies.

Ms A VAN WYK: Chairperson, the sound is nonexistent. We cannot hear.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, even the voting
system is down. I think with the virus and the flu, cold and fever have
affected the sound system. The Minister himself is unable to respond,
because I think he has a frog in his throat. Technicians are attending to
the problem right at this moment. May I also then make an appeal to hon
members to desist from communicating with one another. Proceed, Mr
Minister.

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Thank you, Chairperson.
A question of access to energy, I suppose.

Based on the delegates' expenditure of R1,53 billion and the investment
leverage from the private sector, it is estimated that more than R8 billion
of new business sales was generated by the summit.

We had also established a target of 30% in the procurement procedures for
the summit in favour of black economic empowerment. At this stage, we
already expect that the target would have been exceeded and the figure
would be closer to 48%. I think this will be shown once all the bookkeeping
has been done.

Four hundred and twenty-two hotels were used in the process, and 400
homesteads; 300Â 000 visits were made to Ubuntu Village; 3Â 900 members of
the media were registered; 25 demonstrations took place, and I am told that
2Â 300 personal computers or PCs were made available. This resulted in some
60 km of cabling for the networking.

According to Mr Nitin Desai, the secretary-general of the summit, this was
the best organised event of the big United Nations conferences. [Applause.]
On behalf of Government, I would like to take this opportunity to express
our gratitude to the many South Africans from all walks of life whose
diligence and hard work brought us the praises of the global community. All
government departments, Gauteng province, Johannesburg Metro and others
deserve credit for their dedication and excellence. The South African
Police Service and other security agencies of the state need special credit
for successfully and confidently undertaking one of the world's most
complex security operations.

In all of this, I would like to extend a special congratulations to the
citizens and the City of Johannesburg for doing the nation proud in the
manner in which they rose to the occasion by hosting the summit in an
impeccable manner.

The summit dealt with a complex set of questions on sustainable
development. The agenda of the summit brought together the work and
challenges of all other major international processes, including
international trade and the World Trade Organisation, the work of the IMF
and the World Bank, the World Health Organisation, the achievement of the
United Nation's Millennium Development Goals, various multilateral
environmental agreements, including the conventions on climate change and
biodiversity, Nepad, food and agricultural organisations, the United
Nations environment and development programmes, habitat and those
international processes dealing with energy and water.

In these complex and wide-ranging negotiations, South Africa had the
responsibility of pursuing its national interests. However, at the same
time, in its capacity as presidency and host of the summit, South Africa
was called upon to play a facilitating, mediating and leadership role.

It is with pride that I report today that all of the intellectual,
management and technical support to the Government to perform its role
effectively was provided by directors-general and the South African Public
Service. I must, on behalf of Government, use this opportunity to give
recognition to the dedication, skill and professionalism of our public
service. [Applause.]

Lastly, I think we must all, once again, extend our gratitude to the
thousands of Gauteng citizens who volunteered to participate in the
activities of the WSSD. Hon members would have seen the volunteers - women
and men - in the volunteers' uniform at the summit. These are women and men
who volunteered to work, some of them for two to three weeks for absolutely
no pay whatsoever. This has once again proved that the spirit of
volunteerism, the spirit of Vuk'uZenzele, does exist amongst South African
people. I hope that hon members will join me in expressing our deepest
gratitude to these volunteers. [Applause.]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Chairperson, there has been much debate on the success or
failure of the World Summit on Sustainable Development. This viewpoint very
much depends on which side of the developmental, environmental or poverty
divide one sits.

The DA is on record for congratulating the organisers on the great
logistical success of the summit which, contrary to many prophets of doom
prior to the event, was a triumph. It was a wonderful opportunity to
showcase South Africa and all her assets. We are sure that this was just
the kickstart our emerging tourism enterprises need. The target set by the
summit includes halving the number of the world's poor by 2015,
significantly improving the life of at least 1 million slum dwellers by
2020, halving the proportion of people without water and sanitation by
2015, reducing HIV/Aids prevalence by 25% by 2005, restoring fish stocks
and reducing biodiversity loss.

Prior to the summit the major stumbling block appeared to be around the
provision of sanitation. This is incomprehensible to anyone not living with
a poor or without any sewerage system, such as the many South Africans
having to cope with the bucket system. How is it possible to have clean
water without sanitation? Some NGOs were not happy that access to water was
still seen as a basic need rather than a human right.

However, most of us will agree that this target was a great achievement.
The DA is concerned that no targets were set for the reduction of
environmentally harmful fuels such as coal and oil, nor were targets set
for the use of renewable energy. The Minister himself chaired the session
on renewable energy and has come in for some criticism for not taking a
stronger stand on this issue. Geoff Davies, the Anglican Bishop of
Umzimbulu, recently commented on the inspiring example set by Costa Rica.

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, I rise on a
point of order. I think the speaker is mistaken. She is quoting an
incorrect newspaper report that I chaired a session on renewable energy.
There was no such session. I did not chair any such thing. It is a wrong
newspaper report.

Ms J A SEMPLE: My apology.

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: I think the Speaker will
address it.

Ms J A SEMPLE: I would like to thank the hon Minister for that correction.
I would like him to tell us which session he did chair.

The Anglican Bishop believes that South Africa's commitment to reach a
target of 3% of renewable energy by 2015 is laughable when our access to
sunshine would allow us at least 50% by then. Davies questions whether this
is due to protecting the ``vested interests of Eskom, with its polluting
coal power stations and pebble-bed nuclear reactors''. Perhaps the Minister
would like to make some comment on this.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson, just to correct the hon
member, that figure that she has quoted is also inaccurate.
[Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, I think this is getting out of hand. The member
is quite entitled to say what she wants to say, and people can draw her
attention to the situation afterwards, but there is a form of harassment in
the House.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I think what we can do is that
members who are going to succeed Ms Semple, can actually take the
opportunity to make corrections, and I would like to ask anyone who feels
that that should happen to take that opportunity. Ms Semple, you may carry
on, please.

Ms J A SEMPLE: Chairperson, the Ministers are clearly feeling quite itchy
about this particular statement, perhaps I will state the correct
information further. [Interjections.]

The agreements have now been reached, but in order for the Johannesburg
plan of action not to be seen as yet another talk shop, the agreements must
be implemented, funds must be mobilised to achieve these goals and targets
must be measured.

During the Interparliamentary Union meeting at the summit, delegates
commented that perhaps some of the failure in implementing the objectives
of Agenda 21 after Rio, was the fact that parliaments were not involved in
that implementation. Let us not make that mistake again. This Parliament
must set its own targets for measuring the objectives of the Johannesburg
plan of action to ensure that they are successful. Then we can truly say
that the world summit held in South Africa was a success and we will
remember it as such. [Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chairperson, the Minister of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism deserves unqualified praise for the outcomes of the WSSD.
[Applause.] A chain is as strong as its weakest link, and ultimately it was
the hon Minister who welded the loose ends together and negotiated
agreements where there could have been better division, even over energy.

``Our greatest failure will result in action'', remains a buzz word of the
summit and partnerships for action do not materialise. And for this to
happen we need, in summit speak, ``pet and a prop'' which, when translated,
means to put aside petty populist politics and to apply pragmatism
appropriately to resolve our problems. Taking the summit outcomes one at a
time, with the essential task of relieving poverty, the equate initiative
demonstrated the value of decentralisation, strong civil society and co-
operation with local government achieve not patronage, but productive
programmes that give people jobs and - surprise, surprise - improve the
environment and the GDP.

Our Government centralises power and adds to the bureaucracy that impedes
sound programmes to relieve poverty. We have a lot to say about US farm
subsidies, but we burden ourselves with bizarre red tape when it comes to
maize tariffs that are resulting in imported rice becoming cheaper than our
own home-grown maize.

As for Aids, the warning that the crisis unchecked could lead to unrest in
the country seems to fall on deaf ears, while solutions stare us in the
face. Government's drive to get its hands on all the global funds, while
KwaZulu-Natal has ample capacity to use it as intended, is an indication of
a lack of goodwill and a failure to put progress before politics. This is
not ``pet or a prop''. Although energy targets were not adopted, as per
flawed Kyoto, at least governments committed themselves to increase
renewables such as wind, sun and biomass.

South Afrca has the predicament that there is little incentive to improve
solar energy supply, particularly as rural people regard it as second
grade. Eskom currently supplies only 4% of energy through solar power.
Clean coal power generation technologies, improved biomass cooking stoves,
solar technology and cleaner fuel technologies could all be introduced
through active partnerships and technology transfer with the USA and other
countries eager to compensate for their own role in polluting the globe. We
must actively pursue these research possibilities to suit local conditions
and to establish local industries using international support.

Sanitation, seen as a major triumph at the summit and in South Africa, is
also less a success story when one looks at the realities of chronic water
service cut-offs, particularly in rural areas, and water service
dysfunction. Repair to communal taps and to prepaid meters is haphazard,
and up to three quarters of RDP projects have allegedly broken down.

There are instances where tariffs for water to the rural poor are greater
than those to urban employed. We need human solutions, and not mere
mechanical ones. It is surprising that the department also remains totally
committed to pit latrines when the summit showed us an excellent enviro-loo
option which is much more environmentally sound, and this also appears to
be neither ``pet nor prop''.

The issue of rooibos tea did not come up at the summit. However, we think
that it would be a good issue for the Minister of Trade and Industry to
take up at the world agenda, so that the issues of patents for
biotechnology can be addressed to suit both camps that argue for total
patent rights or for no patents on life forms.

One of the faults of the summit was its failure to take parliamentarians on
board. And for this, many of us have to pay special tribute to Globe, which
enabled us to move freely on the summit precincts. As members of Parliament
we must hold the executive to account, encourage them and participate in
partnerships. [Time expired.]

Mnr J W LE ROUX: Mevrou die Speaker, ek voeg graag my stem by diÃ© van my
kollegas en die Minister wat die organiseerders van die wÃªreldberaad
gelukwens met 'n puik vertoning. Daar bestaan geen twyfel nie dat die
beraad, uit 'n organisatoriese hoek gesien, 'n reuse sukses was en dat dit
groot voordele vir Suid-Afrika inhou.

Daar word beweer dat hierdie beraad die grootste was wat nog ooit aangebied
is. Van buite gesien, het dit gelyk of alles seepglad verloop en geen teken
van paniek was ooit te bespeur nie. Dis egter duidelik dat dit nie sonder
maande se beplanning en harde werk moontlik was nie. Uit 'n reklamehoek
gesien, was die beraad 'n groot sukses en ons toerismebedryf behoort
onmiddellik die voordeel te geniet.

Hierdie suksesvolle beraad het iets baie belangriks bewys, naamlik dat as
Suid-Afrikaners genoegsaam gemotiveer is en as ons almal saamwerk, kan ons
groot suksesse behaal. Hierdie sukses behoort ons almal aan te spoor om ons
ander probleme, soos Vigs, misdaad, besoedeling en armoede met nuwe ywer
aan te pak en te probeer uitwis. As ons dit kan regkry om hierdie
brandpunte as nasionale projekte te identifiseer, en as ons die pogings uit
die politieke arena kan haal, is daar hoegenaamd geen rede hoekom ons nie
sal slaag nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Madam Speaker, I would like to add my voice to those of my
colleagues and the Minister who congratulated the organisers of the world
summit with an excellent show. There is absolutely no doubt that the
summit, seen from an organisational point of view, was a major success and
that it holds enormous advantages for South Africa.

It is alleged that this summit was the biggest one ever hosted. Seen from
the outside, it seemed as if everything went off well and no sign of panic
was ever detected. It is, however, clear that it would not have been
possible without months of planning and hard work. Seen from an advertising
point of view, the summit was a huge success and our tourism industry
should immediately enjoy the advantages.

This successful summit proved something very important, namely that if
South Africans are motivated enough and if we all work together, we can
achieve great successes. This success ought to motivate us all to try and
tackle and eradicate with new zeal other problems such as Aids, crime,
pollution and poverty. If we can succeed in identifying these focal points
as national projects, and if we can take the efforts out of the political
arena, there is no reason why we will not succeed.]

Chairperson, the progress from rhetoric to delivery is the next major
challenge. To improve the standard of living of millions of African people
who do not enjoy even the most basic needs of food, water, shelter and
safety, is an almost impossible task. Even in South Africa, where we have a
stable government, excellent infrastructure and a sound economy, squalor is
on the increase. In South Africa we have everything in our favour,
including the political will to solve the poverty problem, yet we are only
partially successful.

There are obviously many reasons for our lack of progress, and many debates
in this House have focused on reasons and solutions. One major stumbling
block we must overcome is the fact that the major powers who control 80% of
the wealth and investment capital of the world are sceptical about Africa's
total commitment to good governance and our potential to succeed.

African leaders spending huge amounts on arms instead of development,
President Mugabe's deplorable actions and Colin Powell being heckled have
not done Africa's cause any favours. Africa needs billions of rands of aid
and development capital. The ball is in our court to prove that we as
Africans can and will succeed.

We trust that the success of the world summit will change some of the
negative perceptions developed countries might have.
Njing L M MBADI: Mhlalingaphambili, phambi kokuba ndivule umlomo ndicela
uMphathiswa lo athabathe izinto zakhe amamele.

Le ngqungquthela ebe iseRhawutini ifikile, yadlula. Ukudlula kwayo ishiye
isithembiso. Okokuba uMphathiswa uyakhumbula mhla wayesenza kwa ingxelo
efana nale kwalapha ePalamente, ndaphakamisa izinto abantu basemaphandleni,
ngakumbi ezilalini kule ndawo ndivela kuyo, abalindele zona. Le
ngqungquthela iseRhawutini iza kuba zisela ntoni? Ewe, uyiququzelele le
ngqungquthela kunye nesebe lakhe, yaze yayimpumelelo. Sibamba ngazibini
kuye, uMphathiswa, into kaMoosa nesebe lakhe.

Kuzo zonke ke ingxaka-ngxakana athe wadibana nazo kula mazwe ngamazwe
ebehlangene, kuqulunqwa ikamva lelizwe ngokubanzi, phaya ezilalini abaya
bantu balambile bafana neentaka. Amantshontsho entaka alindele umfunzelo
oya kuvela ngentla, akhamisile enjenje. Sikhamisile ke phaya ezilalini,
salindela into yokuba kuza kubakho into eza kuvela apha. Asinayo nale R2,50
yokuthenga itikiti lelotto phaya ezilalini. Ke ngoko bekunzima okokuba
abantu bethu bangaya buqu phaya.

Balindele kuye ke umhlekazi okokuba kubekho imifunzelwana abaya kuthi
bazichole iziimvuthuluka naphantsi kwetafile. Kambe akukhange kude kube
njalo kuba kaloku izithembiso ezi azityiwa. (Translation of isiXhosa speech
follows.)

[Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, before I open my mouth, I would like the hon
Minister to take his headset and listen very carefully. The summit that was
held in Gauteng came and went. There were promises that were made there. If
the hon Minister can remember the day when he was giving a similar report
in this very same Parliament, I announced the things that people in rural
areas, especially those in my own village, are expecting. What can they
expect from the conference held in Gauteng? Indeed, the hon Minister and
his department organised this conference very well and, sure, it was a
success. We would like to thank Minister Moosa and his department for it.

In all the problems that he encountered with the different countries that
met there, discussing and shaping the future of the country in general, in
the rural areas people are hungry like birds. The chicks are waiting for
their meals from above and their little mouths are open like this. Our
mouths are as wide open as that in rural areas, as we wait on the
provisions of the conference. We cannot even afford the R2,50 to buy a
lottery ticket. It was therefore difficult for our people to attend.

They are waiting on the hon Minister for whatever little he may be able to
provide them with, even if it is crumbs that have fallen off the table.
Well, their expectations have not been met because, as you know, one cannot
eat promises.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Deputy Chairman, at the outset the ACDP commends the
Government and Josco on the successful hosting of the recent world summit.

The figures quoted in the newspaper and by the Minister seem to vary
significantly, and the economic impact of this summit, unfortunately, is
not seen or experienced by the poorest of the poor.

The concept of sustainable development encompasses several Biblical themes,
including creation, stewardship, love for your neighbour, justice and human
nature. Many involved in the summit are asking, ``Why hasn't there been
more progress in ten years?'' The ACDP is on record as desiring to
positively contribute to debate surrounding the plans and targets in the
six priority areas of health, education, water and sanitation, energy, food
security and technology, as set out in the Johannesburg declaration.

We are particularly pleased that the reference to reproductive health
rights was removed from the final text. We, however, wish to express our
disapproval of the emphasis that was placed on the evolution theory as,
according to the creation theory, we believe man was created in the image
of God and in His likeness. [Time expired.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the PAC congratulates the organisers of the
summit. This was no mean undertaking, the largest gathering in the world to
date. What is particularly remarkable is that there was very little
violence. It was almost reduced to zero. I want to say that if this can
happen when the summit is there, why can it not happen every day?

On a critical note, the summit presented two summits. It was a tale of two
cities: Alexandra and Sandton. Somebody called it a dialogue of the deaf.
Our country is two worlds, the first and the third worlds. The summit was
in the first world and the third world was almost a spectator. The wide
gulf between the two worlds is widening.

I want to commend particularly our black craftspeople who displayed
outstanding work, and I want to say that unfortunately most of them had to
pack their bags for Transkei, Zululand, Sekhukhuneland and Venda. I suggest
that we now organise regular, orderly exhibitions where we can have the
people given an opportunity to sell what they have. It is absolutely urgent
and I think we owe this to them. [Time expired.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, die AEB wil die Minister, die
organiseerders en alle betrokkenes gelukwens met die aanbied van 'n baie
suksesvolle wÃªreldberaad. Logisties het alles goed verloop en in die geheel
het die profiel van Suid-Afrika gestyg. Doemprofete wat van Suid-Afrika 'n
piesangrepubliek wil maak, is deur diÃ© beraad verkeerd bewys.

Die profiel van Suid-Afrika wat deur die aanbied van diÃ© beraad gestyg het,
mag egter nie die knelpunte wat daar in die land bestaan, verberg nie, maar
moet juis as inspirasie dien vir 'n meer toegewyde benadering. So 'n groot
okkasie kan maklik 'n valse gerustheid bring, want bolangs vertoon dit goed
en onder draai die duiwel rond.

Van die duiwel gepraat, die laagtepunt van die beraad was natuurlik die
applous wat iemand soos Mugabe ontvang het, terwyl 'n gerespekteerde leier
soos Colin Powell uitgejou is: ``It's a strange, strange world we live in,
Master Jack!'' (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, the AEB wishes to thank the Minister, the
organisers and all those concerned on the hosting of a very successful
world summit. Logistically, everything went well and, on the whole, South
Africa's profile has been enhanced. Those prophets of doom who wish to turn
South Africa into a banana republic have been proved wrong by this summit.

However, South Africa's profile, which has been enhanced by the hosting of
this summit, may not conceal the bottlenecks that exist in the country but
should, in fact, serve as an inspiration for a more dedicated approach.
Such a grand occasion can easily bring about a false sense of security
because, on the face of it, things are going well, whereas behind the
scenes there is chaos ["onder draai die duiwel rond"].

Speaking of the devil, the lowest point of the summit was, of course, the
applause received by someone like Robert Mugabe, while a respected leader
like Colin Powell was booed: "It's a strange, strange world we live in,
Master Jack!"]

The party's over and South Africa is back to business. Let every role-
player prove to the world that the successful World Summit was not a flash
in the pan. May South Africans and our Ministers exercise the same
consideration, reconciliatory approach and realism in addressing the
conflicting issues facing a pluralistic society in South Africa. [Time
expired.]

Mr M U KALAKO: Mr Chairperson, hon members, not only was the World Summit
on Sustainable Development a success. It also helped to bring to the fore
the importance of linking socioeconomic development issues with a need to
protect our environment. Despite the lukewarm and noncommittal attitude of
the Bush administration towards the summit, developed and less developed
countries agreed on one thing, that is, in order to create a future for
coming generations, the people of the world need to take responsibility of
Mother Nature. Whilst we exploit our natural resources in order to satisfy
our wants, we must always be mindful of the fact that we must preserve
nature for future generations.

One of the important elements was the linking of good governance at all
levels with sustainable development. The fact that the Russian Republic
signed the Kyoto Protocol was one of the important achievements of the
summit. Locally South Africans benefited during the summit in many ways,
especially our small and medium enterprises, as they were part of those who
provided services and transport during the summit. The summit succeeded in
dispelling the myth that Johannesburg is the crime capital of the world,
and this will go a long way to benefit our tourism industry. As a result of
hosting the summit, there are already spin-offs for our hospitality
industry, which is one of the important sectors of the tourism industry.

This success has prompted a global hotel chain group, Le Meridien, to make
itself felt with the development of hotels in Johannesburg and Cape Town.
The group had proposed two hotels at a cost of $200 million each, with a
room capacity of 250. The awareness generated by the summit to the people
of South Africa must be commended. The fact that the summit for the first
time brought the significance of environmental preservation to our schools
and homes, especially in and around Johannesburg, is an important
achievement.

One of the important events of the summit was the hosting of the
partnership conference under the theme, African Process for Development and
Protection of the Coastal and Marine Environment. This process,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, is a contribution to the environment
action plan of Nepad, and it helps to define the way forward to sustainable
development in Africa by fostering partnerships. The African Process
provides opportunities for a range of regional and international partners
to work together with local stakeholders and nationally based projects.

The summit has also enhanced our foreign relations with a number of
countries and has once again brought to the fore the interdependence of
states, that the neglect of the environment by one affects other countries
and ultimately the entire world. Surely, what remains now is the challenge
to make sure that the countries honour their commitments around issues of
sustainable development, and that targets set for implementation are
completed within the time schedule set by the summit. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 17:36.

     (1)    Fifth Report of the Working Group on the African Union, dated 19
         September 2002:


         (1)     Introduction


              The Working Group on the African Union was established on 16
              November 2001 to consider the implementation of the
              Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU). The Working Group
              has tabled four reports on its functioning and one report on
              the Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic
              Community Relating to the Pan African Parliament, which have
              all been adopted by the National Assembly. In the first half
              of the year two seminars, specifically for Parliamentarians,
              were held. Both seminars were aimed at familiarising members
              of Parliament with the African Union and the issues arising
              in the course of its establishment.


         2. Process


             In order to more effectively perform its task, the Working
             Group has established the following Task Teams to consider
             specific areas related to the African Union:


              (1) Task Team on the Implementation of the Constitutive Act of
                  the African Union


                  The Task Team will, inter alia, consider the functioning
                  of the four priority organs of the African Union (i.e the
                  Assembly of the Heads of State, the Executive Council of
                  Ministers, the Permanent Representatives Committee and
                  the Commission), as well as consider any proposed
                  amendment to the Constitutive Act.


              (2) Task Team on the Pan African Parliament


                  The Task Team will, inter alia, consider the
                  establishment of the Pan African Parliament (i.e on
                  conceptual, functional and logistical levels), popular
                  participation in the Pan African Parliament and the
                  empowerment of Parliamentarians.


              (3) Task Team on Building African Unity
                  The Task Team will consider the development of the
                  African Union and implementation of Nepad and economic
                  integration. The Task Team will also examine the
                  involvement of civil society in the process, as well as
                  institutional arrangements.


         3. Recommendations


              (1) The Working Group, as it has not finalised its task,
                  should be mandated to continue with its work on the
                  African Union.


              (2) The National Assembly should -


                  (a)  request Parliamentary delegations to international
                       meetings, including the next IPU Council meeting in
                       September 2002, to raise awareness of the African
                       Union.


                  (b)  interact with other African Parliaments and
                       Parliamentary formations, including the SADC
                       Parliamentary Forum, in order to:


                       i.    promote early ratification of the Protocol and
                           the implementation by the Assembly of the
                           African Union of a recommendation from the
                           meeting of African Parliaments held in Cape
                           Town, South Africa on 27-28 June 2002, to
                           establish a "representative steering committee
                           of Parliamentarians" to facilitate the
                           establishment of the Pan African Parliament.


                       ii.   jointly consider the advisability of having a
                           conference or workshops of Parliaments to
                           discuss, among other things, the role of
                           National Parliaments in furthering the African
                           Union.


              (3) The Working Group proposes that a further workshop be held
                  before the end of 2002 for members of Parliament (South
                  Africa) to engage further in the establishment of the
                  African Union and its organs and focus particularly on

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Appointment of Public Protector,
    dated 25 September 2002:


         The Ad Hoc Committee on Appointment of Public Protector wishes to
         report as follows:


              The Committee was established by resolution of the National
              Assembly on 7 May 2002, and held its first meeting on 26 June
              2002. Initial advertisements were placed in several
              newspapers, nominations were received and the Committee
              conducted interviews before reporting to the House on 28
              August (see Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports, p
              1365).


              The House noted the first Report of the Committee, and
              instructed the Committee to continue with its task and to
              report by 15 October 2002 (Minutes of Proceedings of the
              National Assembly, 12 September 2002, p 1434).


              Consequently, new advertisements were placed in newspapers in
              September, thus reopening the nomination process. A further
              eight nominations were received in response to these
              advertisements.


              The Committee met on 17 September 2002 to consider all
              nominations, including those of candidates previously
              interviewed. Further interviews were conducted on 18 and 20
              September 2002.


              After due consideration of all nominations received and after
              having applied its mind, the Committee therefore recommends,
              in terms of section 193(4) of the Constitution, that the House
              make a recommendation to the President to appoint Mr Mabedle
              Lawrence Mushwana as Public Protector.


     Report to be considered.

              in which formula the factor -


              (a) D represents the salary (basic per annum) which at the
