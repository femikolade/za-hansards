<heading>Railway Men&#x2019;s Hours, Natal North Coast.</heading>

<question by="#strachan" to="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours">

<num>I.</num>

<from>Mr. STRACHAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Railways and Harbours whether it is correct that a circular has been issued from the Railway Headquarters, Durban, to several stations on the Natal North Coast informing the staff that &#x201C;the hours of duty at your station are twelve, less two for meals, per diem. If owing to the exigencies of the service it is not possible to take the time off for meals, the time cannot be paid for. Overtime can only be paid for after twelve hours of duty&#x201D;; and if so, why this departure from the regulation hours of duty schedule has been made?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours" to="#strachan">

<from>The MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS:</from>

<p>In connection with the recent appointment of additional foremen at certain stations on the Natal North Coast line, instructions have been given that the hours of duty to be observed will be on the same basis as the shifts worked by foremen at similar stations in Natal and elsewhere. At most of the stations referred to twelve-hour shifts are in operation with two meal hours, but it is not always practicable for meal hours to be taken at regular intervals. It depends entirely on the exigencies of the traffic. Overtime is not, however, allowed until after the completion of the normal period of duty.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Railways and Harbours:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether the Government of Southern Rhodesia has intimated its willingness to pay half the cost of a railway bridge over the Limpopo River if the Union will extend its line from Messina; and, if so,</li>

<li>(2) what is the position regarding any such proposals?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours" to="#hay">

<from>The MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS:</from>

<p>A proposal was submitted on behalf of the Government of Southern Rhodesia on the lines mentioned by the hon. member, but the Union Government is unable to see its way to agree to the proposal at the present time. I may add that the Union Government was subsequently asked whether it would agree to the Government of Southern Rhodesia constructing a bridge at its own cost over the Limpopo River, and in this proposal the Union Government has expressed its agreement.</p>

<heading>Officer Commanding Troops at Roberts Heights.</heading>

<question by="#conroy" to="#minister_of_defence">

<num>IV.</num>

<from>Mr. CONROY</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he is aware (a) that the present officer commanding the troops at Roberts Heights (Col. Burne) was previously transferred from Roberts Heights because he was not suitable, and (b) that on being transferred back to Roberts Heights in January, 1925, he was promoted from Major to Lieutenant-Colonel and shortly afterwards to Colonel;</li>

<li>(2) why, seeing that the regulations require that all ranks, officers included, must pass a prescribed examination before promotion, this was not done in his case;</li>

<li>(3) whether he is aware that the said officer (a) knows only English, whereas 95 per cent. of his subordinates speak Afrikaans, and (b) that the said officer is in command of the artillery and machine-gun divisions and that he has no knowledge of either of these arms?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#conroy">

<from>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) No. (b) No. The officer named was promoted to rank of Lieut.-Colonel and was only granted the temporary rank of Colonel (without pay).</li>

<li>(2) The promotion of this officer did not constitute a departure from Regulations.</li>

<li>(3) (a) Colonel Burne is not bilingual. The proportion is incorrect&#x2014;75 per cent. of the members of the Force are Dutch-speaking South Africans, of whom the great majority have no difficulty with the other language, (b) Colonel Burne is a qualified machine-gun officer. It is not possible for the officer commanding a mixed force to be a technical expert in all arms of the service, and I am quite satisfied that the officer referred to is a competent officer to command the Force.</li>

<from>Maj. BALLANTINE</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Mines and Industries:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he will not consider the advisability of reducing the supercharge of 25 per cent. for assizing scales where it is found that same is more than sufficient to cover the expenses this charge is intended to meet, and, if so, whether he will have the regulations amended accordingly; and</li>

<li>(2) whether there is any regulation exempting the Railway Administration from having its scales assized, and, if not, why are its scales not being done, seeing that the general public have to pay railway rates on goods weighed on these scales?</li>

<from>The MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES:</from>

<ol>

<li>(2) There is no regulation exempting the Railway Administration. The Department is in communication at present with the Administration, and I understand that the latter is giving the question special attention.</li>

<p>asked the Minister of Native Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether the Government will give an assurance that areas set aside for natives will not be subjected to encroachments as permitted in the past, both in regard to the larger reserves and to smaller areas in the vicinity of towns and villages throughout the Union; and</li>

<li>(2) whether an increase of such reserves and areas which have become congested and therefore inadequate for the maintenance of the occupants in health and comfort will, where practicable, be made?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_native_affairs" to="#pearce">

<from>The MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) The Government exercises continual vigilance to guard against any encroachment on land set aside for Natives, which, indeed, is for the most part entrenched by the terms of Act 27 of 1913.</li>

<li>(2) When circumstances required, land has been purchased by Government to meet the imperative needs of Natives. During the current year there will be a considerable sum on the Estimates for similar purposes.</li>

<li>(1) Upon what date is Mr. H. Oost, M.L.A., to sail for Europe;</li>

<li><span class="col_5177-5178" refersTo="page_0412"/>(2) what amount has been, or is to be, paid by Government in respect of his steamship fare to Europe and back to South Africa;</li>

<li>(6) upon what duty was Mr. Oost engaged in South Africa from the 12th June, 1925, to the 28th June, 1925, and from what Vote was his remuneration paid, and at what rate?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours" to="#marwick">

<from>The MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS:</from>

<p>As indicated in my reply to the hon. member on the 16th June, Mr. Oost, M.L.A., is proceeding to Europe, and has voluntarily undertaken while there to attend at the British Empire Exhibition for the purpose of assisting in publicity work. He will also make enquiries and investigations in Great Britain and on the Continent for the benefit of the agricultural and industrial communities with a view to extending the marketing of South African products overseas. Mr. Oost&#x2019;s itinerary is in his own discretion. It is understood he will sail for Europe by the mail steamer leaving this week. The cost of Mr. Oost&#x2019;s steamship fares to Europe and back to South Africa will not be directly borne by the Central Government, but the agricultural committee which is a sub-committee of the British Empire Exhibition (Union) will bear the cost of these fares. Mr. Oost will also be reimbursed out-of-pocket subsistence expenses up to three guineas per diem, plus actual expenditure on railway fares, etc. These expenses will be apportioned between the agricultural committee and the publicity vote of the railways and harbours administration. The enquiries which Mr. Oost has undertaken commenced on the 12th instant, and between that date and the date of sailing from South Africa, Mr. Oost has been engaged in preliminary investigation work in connection with the enquiries he has undertaken overseas. During this period his expenses up to an amount not exceeding £2 0s. 6d. per diem will be reimbursed by the railways and harbours administration, and will form a debit to the publicity vote. Whilst at sea Mr. Oost will be reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses up to an amount not exceeding 10s. 6d. per diem, which will form a charge to the agricultural committee. No advances have been directly made by the central government or the railway administration to Mr. Oost. I understand, however, he has received an advance from the agricultural committee of the British Empire Exhibition Committee.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence whether it is the fact that regulations have been drafted or are being prepared providing inter alia that an officer of the Permanent Force holding local or temporary rank will within the limits of his district be senior to officers of the Active Citizen Force, etc., in that area who hold similar substantive rank?</p>

<p>Yes, certain revised draft regulations for the Coast Garrison and Active Citizen Forces have been prepared and will shortly be submitted for discussion at a conference of senior officers. Thereafter the regulations will be considered by me.</p>

<from>Brig.-Gen. BYRON:</from>

<p>Arising out of that answer it is not clear if these regulations contemplate the changes outlined in my question.</p>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#byron">

<from>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<p>Until the question appeared on the paper I was not aware of the regulations being prepared. In the ordinary course regulations such as this are drafted, are submitted to various branches of the department, and when they are being considered they are then put to me. The contemplated regulations are something in the sense of the hon. member&#x2019;s question; but they have not yet come before me for confirmation.</p>

<p>I wish to move the second reading of this Bill.

I may say that this Bill, with the exception of Clause 12, was referred last year to the Select Committee, and passed by them, but unfortunately Parliament was dissolved and it has to be referred once more to the Select Committee.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I would call attention to No. 6, where the duty was 3d., with the rebate; now it is 4d: I presume in all cases the maximum tariff will be applied. A large increase of duty has taken place also in cheese. It was 1¼d. before, and now it has been increased to 4d., or 30 per cent., whichever is the higher. There is also an increase on confections and cocoa. The latter has been increased from 1½d. to 2d., and from 2d. to 2½d. I notice that in such things as Quaker oats and oatmeal there is an increase from 2s. 9d. to 3s., or 2s. 6d. and 3s., if you take off the rebate. There is an increase in bacon and ham from 1¼d. (or 1d. with the rebate off), to not less than 3d.; an increase of 2d. a pound. There is an increase in milk from 10s. 4d. (8s. 4d. with rebate off), to 10s. 5d., also an increase in nuts, and in salt of 20 per cent. All these are for the most part necessaries of life, and are bound to increase the cost of living. Take butterine, or butter substitutes, which have been put up by ¾d. lb. That is going to fall on the poorer part of the population. Take cheese, it is put up 3d. lb., if you take off the rebate, or we will say 3¾d. So far as I am aware, this is an industry which is flourishing. I notice that in the year ending 30th June, 1924, there was an export of cheese amounting to no less than 13,745 lbs. In that case it would appear that this industry can already compete in the world&#x2019;s market. Then there has been an increase in fish paste. I have made enquiries and find this article is used largely by the poorest of the population in the towns. Then, in regard to milk, this milk duty was put on about 12 months ago. There was one factory at that time in Natal. There has been no increase in the number of factories. It is a heavy duty. The importation of milk last year was no less than £307,000. There is only one factory in this country of this nature. I should imagine that these new duties will handicap in some degree butter and cheese making. Under the circumstances the Government is not justified in imposing these new duties. Mr. P. J. du Toit, the permanent head of the agricultural department, in the course of an address at Malmesbury on June 26, said&#x2014;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>We are not speaking of America. If we followed America&#x2019;s example and produced more this would be a very different country. Besides, the United States has a home population of 110 millions to serve. Mr. du Toit went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Do we produce more as the result of the increased duty on wheat? It is just the reverse. Our lands are getting poorer, and our costs are rising. Soon there will be another request for an additional duty. The only real remedy is to put our heads together and to bring down the cost of production. South Africa is not the only country with a poor soil.</block>

<p>So far as I can see the new duties are not going to do any good, but will increase the cost of living. I move&#x2014;</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEYTLER</person>:</from>

<p>I understand that the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) has proposed to reduce the customs duty on cheese and butter. I want to point out to the Minister that 800,000 lbs. of butter was recently imported. As the representative of a milk producing district I am flooded with letters from the farmers urging that a stop should be put to this importation. I think that their demand is a very fair one. The manufacture of cheese and butter is an industry which is natural to this country, and if proper protection be given we shall be able to supply the whole country. I think that it is unfair to lessen this protection. I would rather that the Minister made it greater because then we should be able to provide for all local requirements.</p>

<speech by="#gilson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GILSON</person>:</from>

<p>While I am rather loth to disagree with the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), I am afraid I must oppose his amendment. I quite agree with him that in theory it is in the best interests of the farmers that there should be free trade all round, but this House has adopted&#x2014;for good or for evil&#x2014;the principle of all-round protection. The Wage Bill is going to raise the cost of production. Surely if the costs of production are going to be increased the farmers should be given a certain amount of protection in order that they should not have to compete with the products of overseas countries which can produce cheaper than we can. I hope the Minister will stand firm in regard to these duties, for they only give the farmer that protection which is essential for the establishment of industries here. Just as the town industries want protection, so do the farming industries.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kentridge">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to draw attention to an item in the light of certain principles which have been referred to in the course of the debate and which are generally accepted in the House and the country. I refer to Item 14, Confectionery. It is not possible that we <span class="col_5225-5226" refersTo="page_0457"/>shall be able to manufacture this in the country for a considerable period. We are agreed that wherever it is possible by means of a tariff to foster the establishment of industries in South Africa it is our duty to take every available step to see that the industry is established. But in establishing such industry then I think the Minister should take two aspects seriously into consideration, firstly, that we want to try and develop such an industry and as far as possible keep the cost of living down, and in that case we should foster the industry by means of a bounty and not a tariff, and secondly, that where the article is not being manufactured nor likely to be manufactured for some time to come in South Africa, there is no justification why the preference which existed in favour of the article coming from Great Britain should be done away with. With regard to high-class confectionery, which is not being manufactured in South Africa, and will not be for a considerable time, I fail to see what advantage there can be to this country to do away with the rebate in favour of England, and thus drive the trade to Germany where everything is done by coolie standards of labour and the cheapest possible labour. In that way we are doing something to the detriment of England and to the injury of South Africa. The more you encourage sweated manufactured articles to come into this country the more you keep down the rate of wages in this country. There are many other articles in the tariff to which this can apply, and I ask the Minister to take these items into consideration, because by adhering to his present arrangement he is not helping South Africa, but he is injuring the industrialists in England and diverting industry to countries where they have sweated labour</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barlow">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad the hon. member has struck this note, because I notice cases where the Government have taken away the preference on goods which cannot, are not and will not be manufactured in South Africa, and has put England into competition with countries like Switzerland and Germany, where they pay a low rate of wages. As far as labour is concerned, we don&#x2019;t want to help an industry to send their goods to this country when the stuff is produced at a much lower rate of wages than exist in our country. English wages are on a high rate, and we prefer the trade to go to England. For one reason, England takes our goods, and I find, from the figures, that at the present moment we are getting from Switzerland £14,000 a year, and from the United Kingdom £30,000. This item in the tariff is one of the points England is asking us to help them on, but our Government says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No, we put you on the same level as we do the Swiss.</block>

<p>That is no good to England, nor to us. The people in Europe, especially Germany, are working 10 to 11 hours a day at a low rate of wages. I notice the ad valorem duties are the rule in the tariff. They are levied on the home consumption value of the goods. What is the home consumption value of the goods? As the Bill is not before the House, no one really knows, and if we don&#x2019;t know, how can we discuss it? It is quite impossible to argue unless the Minister tells us what the home consumption value of the goods really is. An important question has arisen in regard to sugar. It is claimed there is dumping of American sugar in South Africa. This claim rests on the comparative price with the home consumption value. I would put a question to the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) as to what he means by dumping of sugar. I have written down the question. It is claimed that there is dumping, because the price of the goods on which the duty is not paid, that is the export price, is less by the amount of the duty than the price of the goods on which the duty is paid though the amount received by the manufacturer is the same in both cases. If that is going to be claimed about sugar, you might claim it about whisky and the new artificial silk stockings, the raw material for which comes from Belgium.</p>

I would ask the Minister whether he is prepared to put into this tariff a stipulation that we shall never go higher than 40 per cent., so that we may know where we stand.

<p>I hope that the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) will not press his amendment to a division. In the first place, the policy of protection was fought out at the last election and accepted by the country and it is only right that it should be given a fair trial. In the second place, if he were to carry his amendment, which I think there is no possibility of his doing, it would mean the shutting down at once of a number of factories which are only just getting on their legs, particularly the bacon factories, and this as I will show will hit the hon. member himself very hard. He is the well-known breeder of a very high type of pigs, and a great impetus in pig breeding has taken place recently in connection with the increased demands of the bacon industry. He, I know, has been doing quite a big trade in pigs at a very profitable price. I happen to be one of the purchasers of those very fine pigs, but if the hon. member now gets his way and the bacon factories have consequently to close down, it will look very much as if he had been getting our money by irregular means, <span class="col_5227-5228" refersTo="page_0458"/>because we shall have bought these pigs for an industry which owing to his action will no longer exist. I think that the hon. member, having registered this protest, should be satisfied with that; but I do agree that the bacon factories will have to pay serious regard to the price demanded of the consumer, and not risk the loss of this enhanced protection, as has been hinted by the Minister for Finance, by surcharging.</p>

<speech by="#moffat">

<p>I really cannot understand how farmers can be protectionists, because, after all, the farmer does not look merely to a local market as his industry develops. He looks to an export trade. If there is any industry in this country which ought to be able to start on its own basis without any protection it is the dairy industry. We are crying out in this country for the employment of the young men, and we have plenty of land available and suitable for dairying, and yet here we want to protect an industry which ought to be able to start on a fair basis of its own. If we start with a protective duty on dairy products, it simply means that we are starting on a wrong basis. I do feel that, in regard to dairying in particular, we ought to start fair and square on the right basis of the market values of the world, and really when I think of what has already been done in the dairying industry in this country I think we ought to be encouraged to go on and compete in the open markets of the world with our products. The hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) knows very well that this particular area has competed in the dairy shows in England with great success. I happened to be in England some years ago, when Griqualand East cheese took the first prize against all the Dominions for the best class of cheese. If we can do that in Europe in regard to cheese, we can do it also in regard to butter and other dairy products. I think that if we start on a protectionist policy in this country in regard to farm products we shall be handicapping ourselves in the development of our industries. If we, as farmers, look for a protectionist policy, how can we oppose the protection of other industries in this country? Let us be free traders and show that we are prepared to compete in the open markets of the world with our products. As free traders&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am glad that in the early stages of this suggested tariff, the committee is approaching the question in a very serious manner. The question of protection is one of such importance that I propose to direct the attention of the committee to other items that are coming on later. I am not so much concerned about this item as I am about the many items that will come on at a later stage. With regard to this duty of 35 per cent. ad valorem on high-class confectionery, it does not take very much understanding to realize that as far as the higher class confectionery, particularly chocolates, is concerned, the result is going to be simply to shut out the English. American and Canadian manufacturers of these high-class goods, and we shall see that this trade will get more into the hands of Germany. With this tariff of 35 per cent. ad valorem, you will shut out every other industry where the men and women are working under fair conditions and at a fair day&#x2019;s wage, and you will find that your higher class chocolates must come from Germany. They are making high-class chocolates at Woodstock, but it is not going to be able to compete against some of the imported chocolates. It is almost going to force some of the people who make chocolates in this country to put on a false trade description. We must give credit to the Government for an endeavour to try and develop South African industries; but I am afraid that instead of doing that it is going to increase the cost of many of these things, and is going to drive the trade of this country away from legitimate white channels into channels where people are working under low economic conditions. This is one of the least important of the items, but it is well that we should approach the smaller points before we come to the bigger ones. I hope the Minister will deal with this in an elastic way in so far as we must take advantage where it is possible. The most important point of all is that we must apply a tariff for the benefit of industries in the country or for industries that are developing, where the country has a nucleus of that development or where we see a possibility of an immediate development. The question of sugar has been dealt with by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow), but I want to point out that when you come to the higher grades of confectionery, that when it says 3½d. per lb. or 35 per cent. ad valorem there is no question that it is going to be the 35 per cent. I hone the Minister will see that some elasticity will be given.</p>

<p>During the present session we have noted some very remarkable developments as the result of the Pact, but nothing strikes me as being more extraordinary than that it is left to us to look after the working man so far as his butter and bacon are concerned, whilst our Socialistic friends are busying themselves with the importation of confectionery. I suppose when we come to motor cars there will be a similar protest. Candidly, I think nothing has been more humiliating than this spectacle this afternoon. Here we have these gentlemen on the cross benches who for years past have advocated <span class="col_5229-5230" refersTo="page_0459"/>cheapening the cost of living for working people; and this afternoon when the question is raised in concrete form by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) not one voice from those benches is raised, and they all show the utmost concern over imported confectionery. It is an eye-opener, and an indication of what this combination of parties is leading to. We are finding that the poorer people have to be defended by so-called Tories. To come down to the hon. member for Cape Town (Central&#x2019;s) proposal, I would like to ask tile Minister what is the necessity for the increase of these duties on agricultural exports. We are taking the item cheese. I know the hon. member has indicated that there is an export trade in cheese in South Africa already, and I know so far as Johannesburg is concerned of the case of one farmer up there who can find a ready market for every cheese he can turn out. I know as a matter of fact that he has many orders from Johannesburg and other places for his cheeses which he cannot supply. Although the Eastern Transvaal is not so celebrated for these cheeses as the division from which the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) comes, I do not know that they have any difficulty in selling their cheese, even in competition with imported cheese. Whilst I personally am a strong protectionist, I certainly would like to know what is the necessity for raising the price of these commodities upon which the poorer classes of the community so much depend. Certainly I would like to appeal to the gentlemen on the cross benches to forget their chocolates for five minutes and come down to these matters, matters which they have always contended for. It is the same old cry; it was bread once; they dropped the bread. Here is a chance of cheapening cheese, butter and bacon, and not one word from the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) and his party; they are all concerned about the chocolates.</p>

<p>I am very surprised at the hon. member. It is a matter we must deal with under the item under discussion, that is, dairy products and confectionery, etc. It is the same principle. I would like to draw the hon. member&#x2019;s attention to one or two facts. If we start a free trade policy we know full well that in this country we are living on a higher standard than what is unfortunately the case in Central Europe. The report of the German Economic Commission and South African reports lay down that whereas in South Africa it would take eight hours for a carpenter to earn enough to buy a pair of boots, on the other hand it would take a carpenter in Germany 62 hours to earn enough to do so. In other words, he would produce the commodity so much cheaper by having to work longer hours for a smaller equivalent wage, therefore the ultimate cost of production would be so low that if it was imported to this country it would undersell the products of this country. Take a suit of clothes. It takes a working man approximately a week to earn enough money to purchase a suit of clothes. In Germany he would have to work 13½ weeks, showing very clearly that if we allow free import of commodities it would be cheaper in cash for a working man to purchase, but he would have no money to purchase the articles the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) imported from countries where the conditions of the workers were worse than in South Africa, therefore we must stand for the principle of a person being able to live, not by exploiting other people, whereby the men in this country will be unable to purchase any commodities. We find the equivalent values in all other countries are at the mercy of gentlemen of the stamp of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), who have their agents in every country and who purchase the products of every country, if we carry out the free trade policy which he has advocated, not only will you have foreign confectionery coming into this country, and foreign cheese and eggs, but every commodity which is necessary for the people of this country. I would like the Minister not only to increase the duty on these commodities, but to go further, and be more drastic in relation to articles partly manufactured on the continent and finished and packed in Britain and exported to this country. Many of the commodities which reach these shores as British are only partly British. We find that while it would cost 73s. to produce a particular commodity in this country, the same article would cost 56s. 9d. in Britain and 19s. in Germany. We also know, in connection with confectionery, that beet is cultivated very greatly in Germany, and they are able to produce sugar there even cheaper than we can in this country, so that, by our protectionist policy, we are not only benefitting the people of this country, but incidentally benefitting the people in central Europe, by stipulating that they cannot export to this country until they develop themselves to a, higher standard from an economic point of view.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to item No. 17, &#x201C;eggs.&#x201D; This has nothing to do with elections. There you find liquid or dried eggs, duty 3d. a pound. These liquid eggs come from China, and the imports for the last year amounted to £3,600, nearly all from China. I should like to see a duty of 3s. a pound put on liquid eggs. Anyone who has any knowledge of liquid eggs from China, will desire to see their import as foodstuffs, prohibited. I suppose there is no country in the world that has developed the art of adulteration to the extent China has, and I am sorry for the people who eat cakes and other things made with these liquid eggs. I hope the Minister will enquire into this matter, and put on a prohibitive duty to prevent such eggs ever coming in. Then in regard to item 22, fruits. I am surprised that the maximum tariff proposed in regard to bottled, tinned or preserved fruits is only 2¼d.</p>

<p>I think if these imported preserved fruits are going to be consumed in this country it should only be possible <span class="col_5231-5232" refersTo="page_0460"/>io place them on the table like champagne or other out of the way luxuries whose presence are an indication of extreme wealth. If this tariff is to operate as a protective tariff, as it should, that small tariff ought to be quadrupled. I do not think we should in any way encourage preserved fruit being brought in from outside. We ought to make the tariff almost prohibitive. In regard to crystallized fruits, surely we should not make an exception in regard to these, when we consider that we have the sugar, produced in Natal, and there has been difficulty in finding shipping space for the export of our fruits. Possibly they come under a higher tariff elsewhere. As to imported fruits generally, the proposed tariff ought to be increased at least three times. In regard to item No. 40, seeds, these are imported free; but seeds for retailing in packets should bear a duty. There are a number of people raising seeds in this country; but seeds are sent in, from Germany principally, and the girls who have been employed in this country in making up seeds in packets for sale, even when they are imported in bulk, will find that they are knocked out of this occupation entirely. I hope the Minister will see his way to make a special line, that if seeds are brought in for retail sale in packets there shall be a tariff, so as to ensure work being available here for those who have hitherto been employed in this work.</p>

<p>I am very glad of the protection which is given to our farmers in connection with cheese. The protection is large and will help the farmers to produce more cheese, but I am sorry that as regards butter no difference is made in the protection between the old and the new tariff. The old tariff of ¼d. per lb. on butter was of course intended for butter imported from England, but we get no butter from England. We have with regard to butter to compete with Australia and other countries, and in this respect we are not assisted. I just want to mention the figures for importation of butter for the last few years. In it was 72,308 lbs., valued at £5,230; in 1922. 196,000 lbs., valued at £14.000; in 1923, 1,166,000 lbs., valued at £91,000, and in 1924 it went up further to 1,579,000 lbs., valued at £109,000. This shows that more and more butter is imported every year, and our production is suffering in consequence. The cattle farmers have suffered in the past few years since 1920, and must be protected. The protection of the butter industry will assist much. I am sorry that a representative of cattle farmers, the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat), has spoken against protection, and said that we should compete with the world market. My experience is that we should first protect our industries in South Africa to make them strong, and then to compete with the world. We are still young in development. I do not know whether the hon. member for Queenstown spoke only for himself, I cannot believe that his view is the view of the cattle farmers in his constituency. I have received letters from his constituency to insist upon protection. I should like to propose&#x2014;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the question of cheese was well dealt with by the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat). If our farmers can send cheese to England and gain prizes for it what is the good of asking for more protection? Increased production will be detrimental to the industry, and encourage inefficiency. A bit of competition does nobody any damage. We are not justified in a thing of this kind, in increasing the duty. The industry is flourishing. So much so that it can export to other countries and gain prizes. Then we have ham and bacon. It is true pigs have gone up in price, but that is no justification to call for an increased duty. My policy is the one laid down by the chief permanent officer of the department who says we want more milk from the cow. Exactly. That is the answer I give to the hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler). You are protecting milk heavily. I produce milk, 50 gallons a day, and I make it pay. We want more wool from the sheep and more business on our farms, and the Government are spending thousands of pounds to improve farming. They have a system of milk testing, and an official goes through the country and the farmers can have his services to improve the output of milk from the cows, yet at the same time we are putting a heavy duty on milk. These duties only encourage inefficient work. From what has been said I have not seen any justification for these three duties. I have taken three of the largest, which bear on the common people, and I would like to point out that the income of most people in this country is a fixed sum, and they have to make it go round. If they have to pay more for cheese and bacon they buy less, or they buy an inferior quality. I want also to draw attention to the matter of gelatine. He has put on there an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent. maximum, plus a suspended duty of 15 per cent. I bring this up not because I am interested in gelatine, but because it is the first opportunity we have had of discussing the important principle of suspended duties, which are unjust. Why should this House part with the right to put on such taxation as it thinks fit? In the British House of Commons a proposal of that kind would not be entertained for a minute. They maintain that any taxation should be by Parliament, and not be left to the Minister, and certainly not to an official. It is an extremely bad step. Why does he not put on the duty he wants, and leave over any additional duty till later on. Parliament is in session five months of the year, and this could be done. People will be coming whining to my hon. friend asking him to put on a suspended duty. I would like to see the entire suspended duties knocked out, and leave the responsibility to Parliament. Then I want to raise an important matter in regard to sugar. We have in this country a growing industry in jam making, and one that must grow, or it will be a bad look out for the fruit growers of this country. I am not discussing the duty. They have got to use a lot of sugar in jam making, and the industry must grow, because if you pick your fruit for export there is a certain amount you cannot send away, and that is sent to the jam factory. This industry at the present moment is handicapped because it has to buy sugar duty paid, or else local sugar, which is tantamount to the same thing. It is the jam factories which have imported the sugar from America at the lower prices. The industry is handicapped and cannot export jam from South Africa to compete in the outside markets if they have to buy duty-paid sugar. How can they compete with jam making in Great Britain, where they get free sugar? If they are handicapped the industry cannot flourish to any extent, and it cannot become of any importance except they can do an export trade. It is the same in other industries, agriculture and so forth. Once they get to the point of exporting they go ahead, but if they have to depend on the local market, where prices vary, it is a miserable business. Perhaps the Minister cannot put it in the tariff, but he can put it in the Bill, under which he gives a rebate on the sugar used in the manufacture of jam for export. That is done in other countries. It should not be impossible for the customs officers to keep a correct tally of the sugar used in the manufacture of jam, or to get a sworn statement as well from the manufacturer as to the amount of sugar used, and make a refund of it when the stuff is exported.</p>

<p>Under head 21 (a) mention is made of the duty of 15 per cent. ad valorem on imported food for children. This may be an unimportant item, but in the prevailing circumstances in South Africa it is one of the most important things that we should keep our <span class="col_5235-5236" refersTo="page_0462"/>eye on. About 4,000 white children under the age of one year die annually, not to speak of the large number of coloured and native children who die every year. My experience, and that of others, is that about 75 per cent. of the children die from stomach complaints, and as we have in South Africa so many poorly provided for and poor people who have great difficulty in buying the necessary children&#x2019;s food it seems to me to be a national problem to make children&#x2019;s food which is specially prepared as cheap as possible.

He has some times to go for days and for hundreds of miles to get to the first market. It therefore seems to me that the Government should provide proper protection.

The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Tagger) never loses an opportunity of stating his opinion in regard to the sugar industry of this country, and that opinion is the result of his free trade outlook. There are certain elements which must always be considered in connection with the sugar industry, and which are absent practically from every other industry of primary production. Wherever sugar is grown in any part of the world and consumed in the country in which it is grown, it, is grown behind a tariff wall. In the United States, in Canada, in Australia, in Europe, in every country where it is grown, it is grown behind a tariff wall.</p>

<p>I said that in any country where it is grown and consumed, it is grown behind a tariff wall. Cuba is a growing country, not a consuming country. Its population is engaged almost solely in sugar production. Cuba has reached its limit of production. It is a country which is extraordinarily favoured by nature for the growth of sugar. It produced in the region of 4,500,000 tons this year, and it supplies a very large proportion of the sugar which is consumed in the U.S.A. The world produced about 20.000.000 tons of sugar, I believe I am correct in saying, this year, and a large proportion of that is beet sugar. I want to give the House some idea of the tariff walls behind which the greater portion of the sugar of the world is grown. In the United States they have a duty on refined sugar of 9s. 5d. per 100 lbs. They produce in the United States and in countries which belong to the United States 2.000,000 tons of sugar. That sugar comes in free into the United States. But their consumption is some 5,000,000 tons, so they get 3,000,000 tons from Cuba on which they pay a duty of 7s. 11d., that is to say, there is a preferential rebate of the difference between 9s. 5d. and 7s. 11d. in favour of Cuba. That sugar is brought into the United States, it is refined in great refineries, and what is not wanted for consumption in the United States is exported overseas. The sugar growers of the United States are in precisely the same position as we are in this country. In Louisiana the sugar planters are growing sugar under a protection of 9s. 5d. per 100 lbs., while we, in South Africa, are growing it under a protection of 3s. 6d. per 100 lbs. In Australia they have got an embargo upon the importation of sugar from anywhere in the world for three years. Their duty is 8s. 4d. per 100 lbs. In France there is a duty of 23s. 7d. per 100 lbs. in regard to beet sugar. Behind that tariff wall the sugar growers of France grow their sugar. Germany has a protective duty of 18s. 3d. per 100 lbs. and Belgium a maximum tariff of 46s. 2d. and a minimum tariff of 15s. Holland, under the old duty, had a tariff on South African raw sugar of 20s. 8d. and on refined sugar of 22s. 2d., but has recently brought in a new tariff, I understand, which is 12s. 10d. per 100 lbs. and an additional 8 per cent. ad valorem. Portuguese East Africa has a tariff wall of 22s. 3d.. Czecho Slovakia a duty of 19s. 2d., and Canada, which is also growing beet, has a duty of 8s. per 100 lbs.</p>

<p>The West Indies is an exporting country.

<speech by="#nicholls">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>I believe they are. The wages per ton of sugar is the deciding point. These countries are growing cane on land which yields an excellent crop under conditions which we cannot compete against. That is the reason why we need protection. We are growing sugar in South Africa under a protective duty of 3s. 6d. per 100 lbs., and I have laid before the House the figures under which other countries are producing it. From the earliest days sugar has always been a political question&#x2014;it has been the sport of politicians everywhere. The beet industry has grown up under the bounty system, and has grown up everywhere under tariff walls. If this country were to decide to do away with the tariff on sugar in <span class="col_5237-5238" refersTo="page_0463"/>South Africa, as I explained to the House the other day, it would mean our very rapid destruction. I want to tell the House what the position is in regard to sugar in Cuba. The sugar produced in Cuba in 1922-1923 was 4,467,000 tons. Of that amount 2,500,000 tons was owned by American refineries in New York. Another half million was owned by Europeans and a million and a half by Cubans, which means that the whole sugar industry of Cuba is more or less in the hands of the sugar financiers of New York. Their control of the world&#x2019;s sugar supply is so great that quite recently they lent four million dollars to the German beet sugar industry. The result of this, states the &#x201C;Times,&#x201D; is to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">tend to put the American group in complete command of the situation, because, in addition to their present control of nearly all the production in the United States, Hawaii, the Philippines and Cuba, they direct the policy of the German sugar manufacturers, and they will be able to dictate the sugar prices of the world.</block>

<p>That is what our poor little struggling sugar industry of South Africa is up against. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) said there was no sugar dumping. I have tried to explain under what conditions sugar is being produced in those countries I have mentioned I want to put the South African producer in the same position as the Louisiana sugar grower in the United States. What is the position? He produces the same commodity under very much similar conditions, except that he has an annual crop against our two-year crop. He produces his sugar under a tariff of 9s. 7d. per 100 lbs., as against ours of 3s. 6d. per 100 lbs. The Board of Trade and Industries has defined dumping as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ordinary dumping shall mean the sale of goods for export to South Africa on such terms as the export price is less than the home consumption price on which goods for export are sold.</block>

<p>These are the figures. On April 2nd last&#x2014;and these are confirmed by the Customs Department&#x2014;the home price for refined sugar in New York, that is the Louisiana sugar, was 5.95 cents a pound. The export price was 3.70 cents per lb., a difference of 2.15 cents, which is about 8s. 8d. per 100 lbs., upon which the refiners get a rebate of duty. Some of this sugar may have come from Louisiana, or it may not. This sugar is imported into this country and is being landed here under the home consumption price of 8s. 8d. per 100 lbs.</p>

<p>Oh, no. Here you have the United States growing within its own borders two million tons of sugar a year. That two million tons is protected by a duty of 9s. 7d. per 100 lbs. If there was no sugar industry there, possibly the refineries would be at Cuba and it would be a different position. As it is we are penalized to the extent of 8s. 8d. per 100 lbs. If, for instance, it costs us as much in this country to produce as it costs the Louisiana planters to produce, then obviously we should get the same price for our sugar, but if Louisiana sugar is sold here at 8s. 8d. per 100 lbs. less than the consumption price in America, we must go under. The logic of the situation is this. Whatever technical difficulties there may be, whatever legal arguments there may be, the fact remains that the South African sugar planter is asked to sell his sugar under the price at which the Louisiana sugar planter is selling his. It is impossible to distinguish between Cuba sugar refined in New York and Louisiana sugar refined in New York. The sugar coming here may have been grown in Louisiana. In regard to the question of jam, in a sugar producing country there is always trouble between the jam manufacturer and the sugar manufacturer; naturally, because jam consists half of sugar. The jam manufacturer in this country is protected to the extent of 30 per cent. ad valorem. The ad valorem duty on sugar at the present moment is about 17 per cent., so that relatively the jam manufacturer is in a much better position than the sugar manufacturer, who also has to send his surplus production overseas. In our case the only sugar sent overseas is raw sugar for refining. I just want to make one observation to the House. People talk about sugar as if it were all of one quality like flour. It is not. There are many qualities; one may fetch 15s. per 100 lbs., another 25s.; it depends upon the quality. I think if hon. members will only study this free from bias&#x2014;it is a very valuable industry to this country&#x2014;and see what relatively small protection it enjoys in face of the tariff of the whole world, I think they will begin to realize that the sugar industry is nothing but an asset to this country.</p>

<speech by="#roux">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>There is only one point that I wish to call the Minister&#x2019;s attention to in connection with this tariff, namely, that a rebate <span class="col_5239-5240" refersTo="page_0464"/>should be allowed on the sugar which is used for making jam for export. Hon. members will agree that we should protect industries showing vitality. An industry which is getting along fairly well and which is almost without protection is the fruit culture and business. We have already exported more than 1,000,000 boxes of deciduous fruits via Cape Town. Many trees have been planted. The fruit harvest is becoming greater and one way of exporting it is by making jam. I want the Minister now or at a subsequent opportunity to take into consideration the granting of a rebate of the excise and the customs duty on the sugar which is used for jam for export. It will make a fairly large difference and I request the Minister to take this into consideration. As regards the general protection of sugar the public feel that an import duty of 3s. 6d. per 100 lbs. is a little high on an article which is used by nearly everybody. It is almost just as necessary as bread.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls), is quite right in his deduction. He was arguing, I think, that there is a differentiation in favour of Cuban sugar, as against South African produced sugar, of 8s. 4d. per 100 lbs. But the point rests with the Cuban sugar, and my hon. friend has been misleading the committee, because every argument he has been making is based on the fact that there is an 8s. 4d. withdrawal on the part of America. That is in respect of Cuban sugar that has previously been imported into America, and immediately it is exported elsewhere it is subject to the withdrawal of the original duty, so that you are exactly where you were, and you have the same price at which the sugar was produced in Cuba. Would the hon. member argue that there is an 8s. 4d. differentiation against South Africa in the case of sugar imported direct from Cuba?</p>

<speech by="#madeley">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MADELEY</person>:</from>

<p>That is not what we are arguing. I am taking up the point made by the hon. member for Zululand, that there is a differentiation in favour of Cuban sugar, as compared with South African, of 8s. 4d. In taking up that point I am hoping to be able to prove that he is wrong. The question of whether it is crude or refined is beside the point. It is only imported into America for refinement purposes, and if it were imported into South Africa for refinement, I presume it would be for consumption. The hon. member has missed the point. We claim that South African sugar should be produced for South African consumption, not for export for the purpose of making money for the sugar king, and the real test I want this House to apply to the whole question, whether of sugar or anything else, is, if the sugar producers of South Africa, in its finished form ready for consumption, were to reduce their price, would they still be making a profit? We have no means of testing the question absolutely until we know exactly how much it costs you to produce the sugar, how much you can supply it to the consumer at, with a reasonable profit, and how that compares with the price to the consumer in South Africa to-day. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Immediately Cuban sugar started to be re-exported from America, and imported into South Africa at a lower price, what happened? Down came the price of South African-produced sugar. I understand it was something like 5s. a 100 lbs., which the reduction represented to the consumer. In examining the whole of this question, you have to take all the factors into consideration. For instance, we have to consider, in coming to a conclusion as to whether an industry is run in the interests of the country, what wages it pays, what sort of men and women it is employing, and whether it is people of the South African nation it is employing, and whether it is keeping up the stamina of the South African by the conditions it imposes on those producing the sugar. These are very important factors to be considered when we are asked to give exceptional protection. The hon. member has forgotten to tell the committee that there is an additional protection which applies to all imported articles, which all these commodities which are locally produced have, namely, the freightage which has to be paid. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) has put his finger right on the spot when he says that the vast bulk of the consumers of South Africa, like those of every other country, are the wage and salary earners. They have their fixed means. I am firmly in favour of protecting industries from their inception, or, if you like, to bolster up industries provided they are dependent upon the raw products of this country; but we have always to take into consideration, as the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) says, the fact that immediately you raise the price of the necessaries of life to the man who is in receipt of a fixed salary or wage, you are causing him to go without something. That is inevitable. I would like to know how the fostering of the sugar industry is going to operate with regard to those engaged in that industry and earning wages and salaries with regard to all other commodities; because all these have to be taken into consideration. The hon. member for Zululand said that sugar, wherever it is produced throughout the world, it has been behind, more or less, high tariff walls. He made his exceptions, of course. If I remember correctly, Germany, which built up its sugar industry on its beet crop, built up its sugar industry on a bounty-fed system, not a tariff, and what was the result? The result was the same as we had in the case of all artificially-maintained industries for export, for money-making by distribution outside the borders of their own country. The result was that in London you could buy, at that time, German beet sugar at 2d. a pound, and the very man who was producing that sugar in Germany had to pay 6d. a pound for it. It only shows you how very carefully you have to examine a position such as this, and we must be very careful how we are influenced <span class="col_5241-5242" refersTo="page_0465"/>by the artful suggestions and arguments of hon. members who are themselves interested in the particular industry they want to foster. There is one thing I want to drive into the mind of the Minister, for I know what has actuated him. A tariff system is the most dangerous and unscientific method of building up industries. This House having once accepted the tariff system, then it has seriously to turn its attention to safeguards. In building up industries you have to have two most important checks&#x2014;one to secure that the consumer shall not be bled, and the other power to fix prices on a reasonable basis of profit. Then it is no use establishing industries if they do not provide reasonably profitable employment for the manhood of the country. The next important link is to secure conditions and wages mat will safeguard to the workers that standard of living necessary for the dignity of the South African nation. I ask the Minister not to be led too easily by the specious arguments of the hon. member for molasses town.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) is quite wrong in stating that the 8s. 8d. difference is merely a rebate of the duty that has been paid. Sugar entering the United States from foreign countries pays a duty of 9s. 5d. per 100 lbs., while sugar from Cuba pays a duty of 7s. 8d. per 100 lbs.&#x2014;a preference in favour of Cuba of 1s. 7d.</p>

The difference in the home consumption and export prices is not the difference between the duty paid on Cuban sugar.

<p>With regard to the conditions under which the South African sugar industry is carried on, the heads of that industry have invited the Government to appoint a commission of enquiry into it. The fact remains that you cannot produce £5,000,000 worth of commodities without the whole of the community being thereby enriched. Then my hon. friend has brought in another extraordinary argument. He points out that the sugar industry of Germany was created by bounties, and that because of those bounties sugar was sold cheaper in England, Does my hon. friend want people to sell their sugar here at three halfpence per lb., while they sell it at sixpence a lb. in their own country?

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PEARCE</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot understand the arguments used by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) against the suspended duty. The capitalistic classes all over the world are looking for countries where they can manufacture at the lowest possible rate. The cotton mill owners in Lancashire are erecting factories in India. The jute manufacturers of Dundee are no longer producing there, but in India and China, because manufacturing in those countries are cheaper than it is in Scotland. In 1921 £22,000,000 was withdrawn from British industries and invested in Germany and Austria, because of the lower economic condition of the German and Austrian people, which enabled greater profits to be made. The United States capitalist class realize that by keeping control of Cuban sugar they would be able to exploit the cheaper workers in Cuban. We have the right to protect the people of this country, not by giving them articles cheaper and no work, but by giving them work&#x2014;therefore, money&#x2014;so that they can live under decent conditions. In the jade industry it was recently found that the cutting of the stone could not be undertaken at a reasonable price in South Africa, and it was ascertained that a jade bead would cost 5s. 3d. in South Africa, 4s. 5d. to cut in England, against 7d. in Germany and 2d. in China. This shows how economic conditions influence the cost of an article. The arguments of the hon. members for Natal who are interested in sugar are put from their point of view. It is correct from their point of view, because they do not calculate on the figures relating to other industries. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) looks upon it from a importer&#x2019;s point of view only. We have instances that unless this country produces its own commodities it will never be the country we ought to try and make it. By producing commodities in this country we keep the money in the country, and circulate it for the benefit of all concerned. Let me now emphasize it in the protection of a special commodity.</p>

<p>Yes I agree he has dealt with certain definite items on the tariff, but his objections come from the fact that he is a free trader and is opposed to the general policy underlying the tariff. The hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) has dealt with the question of preference. This is a question in regard to which the Government has laid down its policy and on two occasions the House has practically decided with regard to that policy. Another point has been raised on the advisability of differentiating between various countries with regard to the customs duty. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) has dealt with the question of suspended duties. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) has been generally uncomplimentary to the tariff as a whole, he talks about it as an unscientific tariff. We have had a general discussion on the question of dumping duties on sugar. I cannot satisfy the curiosity of members. The Board of Trade and industries is going into the matter carefully and after the Government have had the report they will go into the question. I don&#x2019;t propose to go into all these questions now, because the House has decided on the general principles underlying this Budget. Take the question of preference raised by the hon. member for Troyeville. We have informed the House that the Government has decided it will continue to grant preference in regard to particular items from Great Britain and the dominions, but we intend cutting it down by a considerable amount. It may be unfortunate that confectionery is one of the items where the preference disappears. Unfortunately the rebate had to disappear from many items, but these rebates have been considerably increased in regard to certain specific items. In carrying out this general policy it is also unfortunate that we have not been able to apply it to as many items as hon. members would have liked us to, but we cannot afford to give preference to the same amount that Great Britain previously enjoyed. In regard to differentiating in articles coming from various countries, apart from retaining the principle of preference in regard to articles coming from Great Britain and the dominions, we do not intend to differentiate in goods coming from other countries to us. Because the labour conditions in some countries may not be as satisfactory as in our own, it will be impossible for us to discriminate. I want to come to specific items in the clause which have been dealt with. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) has moved a reduction in the items of cheese, bacon and ham and butter and milk. As I have said the hon. member is frankly against protection for the farmer or for any other industry. The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Mr. Robinson) says he is a protectionist, but he cannot withstand having a tilt at the Labour party, and he does not want protection for the farming community. Where protection is given it is only after the industry has been investigated by the Board of Trade and they have come to the conclusion that protection is wanted. That applies to the dairy industry and to the bacon and ham industry. With regard to the dairy industry we have this position that at a certain period of the year we have a glut of dairy products whilst at another time of the year there is a scarcity. The farmer wants protection where there is a scarcity after he has been forced to accept the smaller or uneconomic prices for his articles, and when the prices do improve, he does not want other countries to have the right to dump their articles in this country. That has happened in regard to butter. We have a dumping duty to-day in regard to butter and we had to go to the assistance of the farmer and give him protection by putting on a dumping duty. Take bacon. Provision is made that if the price of bacon is unduly raised the duty will at once be decreased. Provision is made that the 3d. duty may be reduced 1½d. if the board finds the price of bacon has been unduly raised.</p>

The hon. member has raised the question of the duty on sugar. Here again the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) will see that provision is made to reduce the protection given to sugar by 6d. if at any time the board is of opinion that a reduction is warranted.</p>

<p>Will the Minister give up revenues?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I think in many cases it will be found that where the duties are decreased he gets more revenue. Then the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) has raised the question of Item 17, liquid eggs. I agree with him that we get this stuff from China and the duty which is now being proposed is practically prohibitive. We don&#x2019;t want these goods to come in. Then the hon. member has raised the question of fruit. The duty on fruit has not been raised at all. We are, of course, getting in small quantities of fruit, but, on the whole, there is no competition in that regard, and the board has not recommended any change in regard to fruit. Then under Item 14 a higher rate is payable than under the old item. A change has been made in regard to crystalized fruits for the purpose of taking that (particular article out of that particular class, and putting it under class 14 where a higher duty is provided. The hon. member has also taken exception to the provision for the admission of seeds. That is again something required by the farmers. I understand that many kinds of seeds have still to be imported, although we supply our own requirements to a certain extent. Under these circumstances it is not advisable to put a heavy duty on seeds.</p>

<p>Even seeds in packets are used by our farmers, and I do not think it would be in the public interest to put a higher duty on them.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. J. P. Louw) spoke about baking powder, and pointed out that the industry here has to contend with strong competition from oversea. Well, he will see that the duty has been considerably raised. The same applies to tartar, which the wine industry is interested in.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) has mentioned gelatine and in connection with that he has discussed the principle of the suspended duties. Gelatine, I may state, is also an industry which is likely to be established here. An Australian firm is making enquiries, and will probably come here. The hon. member attacked the principle of a suspended duty. The Board of Trade is of opinion that this is a means whereby you can give immediate and effective protection to an industry about to be established. In many cases it would be necessary to act at once, and not to have to wait until Parliament sits far the necessary legislation to be passed. After all, sufficient safeguards will be introduced. The increased duty which will be given will have to be approved by Parliament at the next session. The hon. member for Liesbeek (Mr. Pearce) has raised the question of making provision in cases where we give preference to British goods coming to this country so as to ensure that at least a certain percentage of British labour and British material enters into the manufacture thereof. That we are providing for.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member (Mr. Barlow) has asked me on what principle the ad valorem duties will he calculated. I do not know what exactly he means by the over-riding tariff. He will see that, in all cases, we provide for a certain definite tariff.</p>

<speech by="#barlow">

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is true that in some cases, when you have a low-priced article, you must make a specific duty if you want to protect a particular industry. If you have an ad valorem rate in the case of a low-priced article you must give the protection which you want to give to an industry. The hon. member asked me how we are going to define ad valorem rates for the purpose of collecting the duty. That is provided for in Clause 13 of the Bill which will lay down <span class="col_5247-5248" refersTo="page_0468"/>that, for the purpose of assessing the amount of customs duty on goods liable to the ad valorem rates, the value of such goods shall be taken to be the domestic value, plus the extra cost of packing, etc., for export, carriage to port of shipment, and all other expenses incidental to placing goods on board ship. We know the difficulties in regard to domestic value, dumping law, and so on, but we can discuss these matters much better when we bring forward the Bill.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals) has brought up the matter of children&#x2019;s food. As I have said, the duty on such articles is actually decreased. They now come under the class of 15 per cent., formerly they fell in a higher class. The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Roux) and the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) have asked that a rebate shall be granted on the sugar which is used for jam for export. There is, of course, a, difficulty because different duties are paid on inland and foreign sugar. It is, however, a matter which the Government can consider that if the whole amount cannot be granted as a rebate then, at any rate, a certain portion can be granted. We have had a very full discussion, and I hope the House will now be able to come to a decision in regard to the particular items which my hon. friend has challenged.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thomas_smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>We are all extremely obliged to the Minister for the full statement he has made, but I am still not quite clear about the papers he has placed before the House. The Minister, when he introduced his taxation proposals before, introduced to the House a special schedule of, I think, 23 items, placed upon what he called the &#x201C;preference list.&#x201D; He pointed out that the old list, which contained 250 or 260 preference articles, had been cut down to this number. In these cases, irrespective of the ordinary tariff, these British goods will get preference, as laid down in the schedule. Now, in the revised schedule he has placed on the Table, there is a tariff with a maximum and a minimum, what he formerly said was his bargaining tariff. Has he departed from the original preference which gave special treatment to British goods irrespective of the maximum or minimum tariff, because I find the items mentioned are also mentioned in the maximum and minimum tariff. If that is the case it must appear that there is no preference to Britain over and above the maximum and minimum tariff given to any other country, which he led us believe was going to be the case. This means that Britain would not get any better terms than any other country that gets the maximum and minimum tariff. There were three schedules, the special preferential schedule and the minimum and maximum schedules.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I will explain to the hon. member. In regard to the schedule which he has in front of him, the Bill will provide, in the case of the items mentioned there, that Great Britain will receive a minimum tariff, and no other country will get it in respect of those particular items. This is the proposed draft. Perhaps I should read it. I am referring to the customs duty charged on goods specified in part 1 of the second schedule&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under this Act shall be rebated to the extent shown in the fourth column thereof, in respect of goods being grown, produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom, which are imported from there for consumption in the Union.</block>

<p>Then I provide, further, for articles on which we give rebates, articles from the dominions. Then there will be another clause which will provide for the bargaining, but it will exclude these special items. Hon. members need not be afraid. I am going to carry out the assurance I gave when the proposals were introduced.</p>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to refer to the question of the suspended duties. The Minister does not seem to appreciate the difficulty of the merchant with regard to these suspended duties. If he takes up the position that it may be necessary to put them on very suddenly in order to meet some prospective manufacturer who is going to start, then I must point out that if any manufacturer is going to start in any considerable way he is not going to get very far in seven months. It seems to me that he will not be in a position of producing within seven months. That is the seven months in which this House is not in session. I should like to impress upon the Minister the difficulty in which the merchant is put in this case. It takes three months, say, from the time the goods are ordered to the time they are delivered. In that period the merchant may find that the duty has been increased from 5 per cent. to 15 per cent., and the whole of his purchases may be valueless, or he may have to lose 10 per cent. on the whole of these indents. It seems impossible for him to indent under these conditions. I would suggest if the Minister does nothing else he should in this Bill clearly lay down that any suspended duty shall not be put on except with three months&#x2019; notice. That means the merchant must be in a position to know that when he gets goods out here he will not find the tariff already against him. It seems to me to put the merchant into an impossible position, to vary the duties not only during the session of Parliament, but when Parliament is not sitting. They can be varied, by a stroke of the pen, by the Board of Trade. I would like to refer also to another statement of the Minister. We understood, when this tariff was put in front of the House, that there were to be two columns, <span class="col_5249-5250" refersTo="page_0469"/>a general column and a bargaining column. The minimum tariff was to be a bargaining tariff. The Minister now says that this minimum tariff, in addition to being a bargaining tariff, is also to be a &#x201C;threat&#x201D; tariff. That is, that the Board of Trade, with another stroke of the pen, can reduce the tariff on any given item, because in their opinion&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;the manufacturers in that industry are asking too much for their product. He suggested certain factories would be coming and starting in this country; but, in the first place, he is going to say to them: &#x201C;You have a tariff of 15 per cent. in your favour.&#x201D; He is then going to say to them: &#x201C;We do not guarantee that it is going to remain 15 per cent., as when you wake up one morning, if you are not conducting your business properly, you will find it has gone down to 5 per cent.&#x201D; You won&#x2019;t know your tariff, and now that the Wage Bill has gone through, you may come to certain arrangements with your workpeople in regard to wages, but the Minister may come in from above with a board absolutely independent of the workers and employers in that trade, and institute a wage that is also going to knock you out. I suggest that, with these two items alone, this uncertain tariff, and the uncertain Wage Bill, the Minister will not get any manufacturer to come into this country and put considerable capital into it&#x2014;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NIEUWENHUIZE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Minister has stated that much has been said about the general principle of free trade and protection but I want more particularly to direct his attention to paragraph 15, that is the import duty of wheat. I notice with regret, I must say, that the duty on imported wheat has remained precisely the same as the former year. Up to the present it has been 1s. per 100 lbs. or 2s. per bag and it has remained so. I know Mr. Chairman that you, when you were not yet in the chair, always took a great interest in this matter and regularly took part in the debate about it and pleaded in the interests of the wheat farmer. I wish for the information of the hon. Minister to mention the actual costs that are connected with this industry. I am speaking now about the Transvaal but I believe that the figures are more or less the same for the other provinces as well. I have gone into the cost of production on a grain farm of 80 morgen and I come to the conclusion that until the wheat is despatched the costs of tilling of the ground come to £6 2s. per morgen, calculated at an average yield of 8 bags per morgen bringing the cost of a bag therefore to 15s. 3d. The threshing of the wheat comes to 1s. 6d., the bags to 1s., the transport to 2s. 6d. on the average, and the commission to the co-operative society to 1s.. a total of a little over £1. I will now assume that it is only £1. That does not include what in the Cape Colony is p significant cost, namely the expense of fertilizer, and not even the due wage of the farmer himself for his supervision, etc., the great risk of a bad year through rust, locusts, hail, drought, etc. All this I have not included and without all these things a bag of corn comes to £1. Now let us agree that the sale price of a bag of wheat was £1 5s.&#x2014;this is regarded as a good price&#x2014;then it is little in comparison with what a bag of wheat produces when it has once been manufactured because 90 loaves of 2 lbs. at 8d. per loaf are baked from a bag of wheat, and 4s. for the bran. This works out at £3 4s. Therefore the farmer only gets about 30 per cent of the actual value. I just want to take a few concrete examples; one of a man who cultivates his own ground and one of a man who has worked for one-third of the yield. I take a farm of 20 morgen. In the case of a man who owns the ground the yield of 160 bags is sold at £1 5s. producing £200, the costs in accordance with the aforementioned calculation are 160 x £1 or £160. Thus there remains a balance of £40 for his work during the whole year. In the case of a man who works for two-thirds of the yield it is even still less. Then his share is two-thirds of 160 bags, 106 bags at £1 5s. per bag or £133 16s. 8d. The costs in this case are £106 therefore there only remains about £26 as the proceeds for a whole year&#x2019;s work. Now one usually proceeds on the assumption that the price of wheat in Australia and Canada must be the actual guide to us in fixing what a bag of wheat should cost here. I think that that is a wrong method of calculation. I think it would be more in the interests of farmers to take the cost of production as a basis. About 1,000,000 bags of wheat are imported and it costs landed here about 2s. 6d. per bag, to that must be added 2s. duty, total 4s. 6d. This is then added to the price of Australian and Canadian wheat to arrive at our prices without taking our own costs of production into account. I just wish to point out to the hon. Minister the detailed report <span class="col_5251-5252" refersTo="page_0470"/>from 1923 of the Board of Trade and Industries who went carefully into the matter and had given a detailed report. The conclusion of the board was that the import duty on wheat should be raised. The then Government did not see their way to do this but this does not prevent the wheat farmers in general feeling that the time has come to increase the customs duties. I therefore hope that the hon. Minister will in the circumstances still be prepared to meet the wheat farmers by increasing the import duty on wheat.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>I regard the suspended duties as probably the best feature of the tariff, inasmuch as they will enable the Minister so to adjust the duties as to secure proper conditions of labour for those engaged in a particular industry and also in the absence of provisions for fixing prices to obtain some consideration for the consumer. I again impress upon the Minister the arguments advanced from these benches in the earlier part of the afternoon. I admire the skilful manner in which the Minister glided over the points raised from these benches. The question of Imperial preference has been definitely decided and accepted by the House, but the point that we have raised is the detailed application of the principle in connection with particular articles. The Minister has pointed out that so far as 22 items are concerned the rebates have disappeared entirely.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>The paint I wish again to put to the Minister is that where a duty is imposed it should be regulated so as to secure that the article has been produced on a sound labour basis and has not been made under sweated conditions. In the vast majority of cases the Minister by doing away with the rebate has not benefited South Africa in the least, and our trade will be diverted to parts of the world where goods are manufactured under sweated conditions. This will react prejudicially both to Great Britain and to South Africa, and we shall have to compete with the countries where sweated conditions of labour prevail. The Minister has told us in a rather off-hand manner that it would be impossible to differentiate between one country and another with regard to conditions of labour prevailing in those countries. But if it is possible to ensure, and he told the hon. member for Liesbeek (Mr. Pearce) that he would, that the major portion of the goods enjoying the British preference shall have been made in Great Britain, it will equally be impossible to ascertain the conditions under which imported articles are made, particularly those imported from Italy, Germany and Belgium. On no account should we assist the development of industries on the foundation of sweated labour.</p>

<p>I cannot understand why sugar should also always upset hon. members on the cross benches. Being a sweet product I should have thought it would sweeten them rather than make them nasty. The South African sugar industry raises £5,000,000 worth of produce from the soil. It does not use more than half of one per cent. in imported material in the production of that five millions. All the rest is South African produce and if there is any industry worth encouraging, it is a South African industry which is a primary production, and which employs a large number of people, pays good wages and conforms with conditions so dear to the hearts of the labour party. It also provides sugar at a lower price than any other sugar-producing country in the world, which is also a consuming country. Every other country has a high protective tariff. In the month of May the difference of the home cost and the export price in Germany was 17s. 10¼d. per 100 lbs., France and Belgium were the same, Holland was 31s. 3d., Poland 29s. 9½d. These people were paying this amount above the export value, and they could only do that, because no one was allowed to sell sugar against them. In this country the Government has taken another step and is threatening the industry with a minimum tariff of 3s. 6d., less the shilling, which gives an effective tariff of 2s. 6d. That is to be enforced if the industry breaks any conditions of labour, etc. Is the whole industry to be penalised because one mill breaks some of the regulations? Sugar today is selling at 24s. f.o.b. at Durban for number one refined, and as regards the price, the sugar people have no control over that after it leaves the mill.</p>

As soon as India gets its crop Java will send the sugar here, and they are reproducing it with black labour without supervision or proper sanitary conditions. Australia prohibits the importation of sugar. They had a tariff of 22s. 6d. per 100 lbs., but they found it was not sufficient, so they prohibit sugar altogether. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) referred to jam. There is to be a conference next month to try to come to some modus vivendi in this industry, but everything will depend on the price of sugar. There is an amount of moisture in sugar. If you want a dry sandy sugar, pure white, then you have to pay for it, and by sandy sugar I mean sugar that will run. I believe the jam people receive a rebate from the excise.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STALS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not wish to take up the time of the House any longer than is necessary. When we last discussed this matter the Minister of Finance made a statement which created an impression which he did not intend. We understand that the wine farmers in the first instance require more protection than what is given by the import duty. I think that it will not be fair to the wine farmers if we do not express our disappointment at the Minister&#x2019;s statement last Wednesday. It is not necessary for me to go into details. But where there is such a large portion of the population who make an honourable living from this industry, where there is a surplus, and where development is constantly still taking place in that industry, we feel that there must be a weak spot somewhere when we find that year after year we import drink which exceeds the value of our manufactured produce. The statement of the Minister made the impression that the standard of the local product is of such a kind that our product will not be used if the foreign article is kept out because the foreign article is so much better. I do not know whether that was the intention. Where there is an attempt being made in this country by maturing and improving the production to have the local article used in preference to the foreign article then the Government should assist to make the local product of such a quality that it will be drunk. Measures must be taken to so improve the local article that it will no longer be of inferior quality. We do not for a moment admit that that is the case and therefore we took up the position that the producers in the Union have a right to more protection. I hope that the Minister will fulfil his promise and that the matter will be investigated before the next tariff is fixed.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with what has been said here by the hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals). A farmers&#x2019; congress was held at Malmesbury last week&#x2014;not only made up of grain farmers&#x2014;but all kinds of farmers. It was fairly representative and the Secretary for Agriculture was also present. He gave the farmers there good advice as usual and the conference then passed a resolution in favour of the increase of the import duty on spirituous liquors. With a view to the attitude we took up in the past it will be a great disappointment if the import duty on spirits is not increased.</p>

<p>I just wish to say that I informed the House that this matter had been considered by the board of trade and industries but not so thoroughly as such matters are usually considered, for there has not yet been opportunity, and the board did not feel justified in suggesting a larger measure of protection. I also said that the board would enquire into the matter again to see what could be done. I did not for a moment say that the local article was inferior. What I asked was, whether the man who is accustomed to whisky will drink our brandy if whisky is prohibited. It is a question of palate. I cannot say because I neither drink one nor the other. I just wish to point out for information that at the moment I get £420,000 from this source of taxation. If I stop importation I shall lose that revenue but we do not wish to go into the matter now, similarly with regard to the matter of bread mentioned by the hon. member for Lydenburg the board of trade and industries must also go carefully into the matter and report.</p>

<p>I was pleased to hear the Minister&#x2019;s reply, because it is not a thing; that should be rushed into rashly or blindly; it is a matter that has to be considered from all sides. Naturally, as representing wine farmers, one would like to see the import duty on foreign spirits as high as possible. Some little time ago, when the wine farmers asked for a prohibitive duty; but I should say that if the Minister was to take a step of that kind it might do the industry more harm than good. It is pretty certain that it would have a harmful effect. It is natural that the wine farmers should ask for a higher duty; but the Minister has to consider the matter from all sides, and I hope he will make a study of the whole subject before he puts on a higher duty. Imported spirits may be able to pay a moderate increase of duty to the extent of 9s. or 12s. and give him more revenue. For these reasons. I am very pleased to hear the Minister say he will have to go into the matter very thoroughly, to see whether it might not do the wine industry more harm than good.</p>

<p>I wish to move a reduction on Item 61, blankets, rugs, etc., (a) weighing more than 12 ozs., containing 50 per cent. or more of cotton. That duty has been raised from 25 per cent., less 3 per cent. rebate on the British article, to 1s. per lb. I also wish to draw attention to Item 61 (c) blanketing and kaffir sheeting on which the duty was 15 per cent., and has now been raised to 1s. per lb. This is a tremendous increase in taxation. Of course, these are the articles made entirely of cotton and used for the most part by the natives of this country. There are two classes, the white cotton blanket or sheeting which comes from Manchester, and there is the cheap cotton blanket which is coloured and is made of waste cotton, and generally comes from Belgium and Holland. To give the House some idea of how the duty has gone up, I have before me an example of a shipment of cotton blankets where the duty is given on the shipments. The old duty on an article costing 1s., 25 per cent., was 3d., the new duty is 1s., an increase of 300 per cent. Then we have an article costing 3s. 9d. (3 lbs.); the old duty was 11½d., the new duty 30d., which is an increase of 175 per cent. Then we have kadungas costing 1s. 6d. each, in that case the old duty was 12 per cent., equal to 2.16d. each. The present increase is up to 20 per cent. equal to 66⅔ per cent. increase in duty. On cotton blankets, coloured, or rather better quality (2 lbs.) the old duty was 25 per cent. and the new duty 103 per cent. The cost of a whole shipment free on board, of which I have particulars before me, is £849 5s. 11d. The old duty on that shipment would have been £212; the new duty is £768. You may say, quite truthfully, that the average duty on these blankets is now 100 per cent. Here are articles worn by the poorest people in the country. The Prime Minister has charge of the interests of the natives. I venture to think he has not been consulted in this matter.</p>

<p>Thousands of natives will not be able to afford to buy these blankets and, consequently, will have to use sacking for their wives and children, and to some extent for themselves. Then this increase of taxation comes on the top of other increases so far as the natives in the Cape Province are concerned. We have just agreed to levy a poll tax of £1 on every male native. In hundreds of cases that pound will take some earning. With the native the blanket is, perhaps, one of the most important articles of clothing. This will be an oppressive tax on the natives. The Minister thinks that the distributors of these blankets obtain large profits &#x2014;something like 100 per cent.&#x2014;but that idea is absolutely and entirely incorrect. I have had telegrams from the Eastern Province bearing out my statement on this point. The cotton blanket is a standard line, and a kaffir, when he enters a store, first asks the price of blankets and judges the other articles in the store by the price asked for the blanket. Consequently, storekeepers cut the prices of cotton blankets to the bone.</p>

<p>25 per cent. on the cost. No retailer can afford to do business at less than 20 per cent. on returns, or 25 per cent. on the cost. I will admit that high prices had to be charged during the war, but that applied to all articles. You cannot make these blankets at anything, like the price in this country. The coloured blanket is cotton-waste from the spinneries, it is the cheapest article made. The ordinary price of cotton to-day is 1s. or 13d. per lb. They are paying about 1s. in Manchester, so there is not much profit. You cannot say this is a protective duty, because it is not and I can only assume the Minister has put it on for revenue purposes.</p>

<p>Then it is downright folly to put on a duty for protective purposes on these Even supposing it is for revenue, he will not get anything like the same amount as before, because the Minister will never understand that most people have a restricted income. If you double the price of the article they will buy less, because no one will give them increased wages just for the purpose of buying blankets. I think it really is a grave injustice. I have also here letters from the Transkei which point out that friction has already arisen from the administration of the Bill. The manufacturers usually make them a few ounces over weight, and at the Customs House they are found to be a trifle over 12 ozs. and they, grasping as much as they can get, charge the extra duty on the overweight, and the consequence is no man knows where he is. There is a standard price for the article, and he finds so has to pay more duty than he expected, and, for that reason it has led to a lot of friction at the customs, particularly at East, London. I press on the Minister to drop this. I do not plead for blankets containing more than 50 per cent. of cotton, because they can afford to pay. I move that this shilling be deleted entirely, and we go back to the 25 per cent., and the same thing in &#x201C;C&#x201D; (kaffir blanketing and sheeting).</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will very carefully consider this amendment of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). It seems to me that this tax is <span class="col_5257-5258" refersTo="page_0473"/>against all principles of taxation to begin with. First of all, it is taxing that class of the community that can least afford if, and, secondly, it is a tax on the bare necessaries of life. For those two reasons alone, it is obvious that the imposition of a tax like this should be very carefully considered and, if imposed at all, it should be as light as possible. It is not clear to me, at all events, what is the object of this taxation. I believe the Minister has disclaimed any idea of getting any additional revenue from it. If he has that idea even remotely at the back of his mind, I think he is mistaken. At all events, the Durban Chamber of Commerce, which has members dealing very largely in these particular articles, reports that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the new rates are maintained, the Government will lose much of the revenue they now collect on these goods, which are only used by natives and the poorer classes.</block>

<p>So far from swelling his revenue, these new taxes will tend to diminish it. I think it has been disclosed by the previous speaker that as a protective measure these taxes are worse than useless. It is obvious that these particular articles are not made in this country, and there is no likelihood of their being made, as far as we can see, for a generation or two; and so from a protective point of view these proposals are useless, and are exceedingly irritating and oppressive to a certain class of the community. As regards the incidence of this taxation, I have also examples furnished by a Durban merchant. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have second-hand army blankets which we were selling last year at 4s. 6d. and 5s. each. The new duty is 5s. per blanket;</block>

<p>and so the cost of these very necessary articles is more than doubled at once by the imposition of these duties.</p>

<block name="quote">Another item is second-hand hats, the cost thereof being 6d. each. There are no inside leathers or outside bands. After putting on leathers and bands we were selling these hats at 18s. a dozen. The new duty is 3s. 6d. on each hat.</block>

<p>That is bringing protection and taxation to the height of absurdity.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Brig.-Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BYRON</person>:</from>

<p>I think a great many are worn by the poorer European population. I do not think natives are very large purchasers of second-hand hats, but at all events we are putting a tax on a very poor class of people who are ill able to pay it. There is another very important aspect, which I think the Minister knows about. There are very strong medical reports about the condition of the natives in the eastern portion of the Cape Province. Owing to various circumstances these natives have not been able to buy blankets and rugs, even with the present duty. They have, owing to poverty, been compelled to dress in sacks or skins. The native, naturally, is a very clean person, and we know that he washes not only himself but he keeps his hut clean and he was ones his garments when he can afford soap. But when they have to wear skins it is not possible for them to keep clean, and the natural result has followed; there has been an epidemic of typhus due to the inability of these natives to clothe themselves in washable garments. Typhus is a louse-borne disease&#x2014;is no discriminator of persons, and we may have to pay for this by an outbreak among Europeans to whom it can be communicated. That alone ought to be a very strong reason for making the tariff on these particular articles as low as possible. We find in 1924 cotton blankets and rugs were imported to the value of £828,000. I think it will be accepted that the vast bulk of these are for native sale and native wear, so that already we are deriving a considerable revenue from them. Shawls also are almost exclusively worn by natives; these were imported to the tune of £105,000. We find that on light cotton blankets there is an increase of duty of 312 per cent., and on blankets weighing 3 lbs. 8 ozs. the increase amounts to 197½ per cent. These are pressing burdens on a part of the population with very little power to resist the imposition of these taxes, and even less power to pay them. Is it any wonder that a great many members have had most strong appeals, not only from European quarters, but from the natives themselves and from native organizations in regard to the imposition of these duties? I have a letter from a native organization in which they say this additional taxation is &#x201C;bleeding and agonizing them.&#x201D; That is how they feel it; that is how it appears to them. I think there has been a very strong case made out for very serious reconsideration of this tariff. I hope the Minister will see the reasonableness of it, and be able to meet the amendment just made by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). We are going on very wrong, and, I think, improper lines. I think it ought to be emphasized that it is against the principles of taxation to tax the bare necessities of life, and especially to tax those least able to pay the taxes. We always thought&#x2014;it has been laid down by all authorities and has been the general practice&#x2014;that the incidence of taxation ought to lie chiefly on those who can best afford to pay. Surely no sensible hon. member will argue seriously that increasing the taxation to the natives by as much as 312 per cent. in one case, is laying the burden on those best able to bear it&#x2019; On the contrary, it is laying it on those who will find it very burdensome. Their necessities of life are being taxed; their clothing is being affected, and this may have serious consequences, not only for the natives, but for Europeans.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should say a few words in reply to what has been urged by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) and the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron). I think the effect of this increased duty is greatly exaggerated. There is no doubt about it that <span class="col_5259-5260" refersTo="page_0474"/>traders from all over the country have set on foot an agitation against this increased duty, but as I shall later on point out, I think this agitation is not altogether disinterested.</p>

<p>Well, other countries have done so and we might have to consider it if we do not keep them out this way. When we come to the cotton blanket, members try and make out a strong case by pointing out the great percentage increase. As I pointed out this afternoon, when you want to protect your industries, and when you have to do with a low-priced article, you cannot deal with it by means of an ad valorem rate. You must have a specific duty. What is this terrible increase in duty on the cotton blanket? The minimum is 1s. per lb. and the maximum increased duty is 2s. 6d., that is for a 2½ lb. blanket. The increase only takes place as far as the low-priced articles are concerned. After that the duty is the ordinary ad volorem duty which applied formerly. We have heard a lot about the poor native child. Do not forget that the blanket of the child&#x2014;under 12 ounces&#x2014;is exempt altogether from increased duty.</p>

<p>Hon. members here have not; but I have heard about it ad nauseam during the last few weeks. This agitation is not altogether disinterested. If people who are so solicitous for the welfare of the natives would have a little consideration, they would realize that the native need not pay a penny increase. I have made enquiries about the landed cost of these articles, and the prices at which they are sold to the native. I met a deputation of gentlemen interested, who represented their case to me, and asked me to consider the matter, and I have done so; but I have also made enquiries, as I have stated. I asked these traders what profit they would be satisfied with, and I was informed that the wholesaler was content with a modest 10 per cent. and the retailer 33½ per cent. I got information to enable me to see how this would work out. I got the information from magistrates and excise officers of the country and it is to this effect: that, as far as the cotton blanket of British origin is concerned, the f.o.b. price of the 16 ounce blanket is 1s. 6d.; whereas that of the blanket of Belgian origin is 1s. 0½d. Therefore, if you want to protect your industry you cannot deal with it by means of an ad valorem rate. What do you think these articles are sold at to the native buyer? Both are sold at 3s. a pound, that is the British blanket costing 1s. 6d. and the Belgian one costing 1s. 0½d. are born sold at 3s. per lb. The landed cost of the Belgian blanket is 1s. 5d. and the retailer adds at least 50 per cent. on the cost to him; so that the retailer who is supposed to be content with a modest 10 per cent. is enabled to get 40 per cent. and the other 50 per cent.</p>

<p>Let us take the 1 lb. English blanket, which is an article of better quality than the other. The f.o.b. price is 1s. 6d. You add to that the importing charges of 10 per cent. and you get 1½d. You add to that the present duty of 25 per cent. that is 4½d., and you get a landed cost of 2s. Take the Belgian article. The cost f.o.b. is 1s. 0½d., importing charges 1¼d., duty 25 per cent., 3¼d., which gives a landed cost of 1s. 5d. You add to that the wholesale profit 12½ per cent. and you get .3 that is three pence in the case of the English article, and in the case of the Belgian article you can add 40 per cent., and get 7d. After adding 331 per cent. retail profit you get 9d., and by adding 50 per cent, in the case of the Belgian, article you get 1s. and you get the price to the consumer of 3s. in each case. If the landed cost of these articles were taken and the blanket sold to the native at the profit which the deputation said they were satisfied with, the price to the consumer, with the increased duty, would be 3s. 3d. only, that is an increase of 3d. on the 1 lb blanket. Let us take me 3 lb. Belgian blanket. It costs 37.7 pence f.o.b.; and add 10 per cent. for importing charges, 25 per cent. duty and you get a landed cost of 50,9 pence. Now I want to give the prices which have been given me, from reliable quarters, at which these articles are sold. In Umtata this 3 lb. Belgian blanket costing nearly 4s. 3d. (50.9 pence) is sold at 9s.; at Herschel at 10s.: in the Queenstown district for 9s.; in Butterworth at 8s. 3d., and in Kingwilliamstown at 8s. You will see that, although in the case of the very low-priced article you may make out a case for 50, 100 or 300 per cent. duty, that, after all, it amounts to nothing. I say again, if you want to protect your industry, and that is the purpose for which this increased duty was designed, you must do it by way of a specific duty. And we want to try and establish in this country factories which will supply a woollen article to our customers. This is a wool producing country. We have some splendid woollen mills and we should encourage the native and others to use the products of this country instead of the shoddiest of shoddy stuff from overseas. If you saw the material from which these continental blankets, particularly, are made, even with this increased <span class="col_5261-5262" refersTo="page_0475"/>duty you would agree that, if you could get the native to pay a little more for a decent blanket, he would be getting better value for his money.</p>

<p>If there is a trade for blankets, is there any reason why our mills should not manufacture a blanket made from wool and cotton. The board of trade would allow the necessary material to come in free, if the native will only wear a mixture of cotton and wool. This is one of the items where, by means of our tariff, we are out to protect the existing industries in this country, that they may have a chance to exist. If, as a result of that, the native, in common with the other sections of the community, has to pay a little more for his article he should not complain. We are not putting increased taxation on the natives alone. There are a number of articles purchased only by white men on which we have increased the duty. If we want to get industries established by means of tariff protection the native must bear his share of the burden as well as the white man. It is not an onerous burden. If the commercial community would be prepared to have a little less profit they will be able to sell the blanket, notwithstanding the increased duty, at the same price that they get to-day. During the war when prices were high, the native wages were the same as they are now. In Johannesburg, during the war, 2 lb. Belgian cotton blankets which cost 2s. f.o.b. were sold to the natives at 8s. 6d. I think this whole agitation against this so-called increased duty is very much exaggerated.</p>

<p>I was very glad to hear what the Minister said about the secondhand blankets, for I hope to remind him of his words later on, when we discuss secondhand films. I am entirely a supporter of a protectionist policy, but I would like a little more information whether there are cotton blanket factories in the Union&#x2014;(Cries of &#x201C;No&#x201D;). I believe you could have such factories established, but it would take some time and a tremendous amount of machinery would have to be imported. The protection should be imposed when steps are taken to have the article manufactured here and not before. Seeing that cotton blankets are not at present manufactured here, but would be made here as soon as it was known that they are being protected, the increased duty should be placed in the suspended list; in other words, the Government should be given the right to impose the extra duty as soon as the cotton blankets are made here. Our woollen blanket manufacture is one of the best industries in the country, and one factory I know, uses only South African wool and raw material. Whether they will ever be able to compete with the cotton blanket in price I do not know, but I do not why the cotton manufactures industry should not become a big one in South Africa. Right through the Continent of Africa cotton goods are being imported on a tremendous scale for the natives, and if we could establish such a cotton industry here, we should have the finest home market. I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I thought I would write you on an interesting subject which will, I am sure, be of interest to you as well as to your fellow Ministers.<br/>Since the proposed 1s. per lb. duty on cotton blankets, I cabled my brother in London to get an estimate for a plant to manufacture cotton blankets in Durban. I have received his reply that some firms in London and abroad are drawing out estimates for a cotton mill for our requirements. I can assure you that should we not have sufficient capital, we know so many people in the textile business in Yorkshire and Lancashire who would invest money along with us to start off this industry.</block>

<p>Since this they have cabled information giving the detailed estimates of what the factory would cost, and I am informed they are going ahead raising the money for the purpose of setting up a cotton factory in Durban to manufacture blankets, and that is only possible through this tariff&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I know there are some protests being made against this duty of 1s. per lb. on cotton blankets, but from an employment point of view I say this 1s. per lb. duty is essential in many ways. South Africa is one of the very few places where cotton blankets are made out of cotton waste, and not pure cotton, hence the reason that blankets can be imported here at the rate of 1s. per lb. f.o.b. What chance has the local manufacturer against that. None whatever.<br/>Since the Government has removed the duty on shirting for the purpose of protecting the local manufacturers I have started a shirt factory in Durban. I can assure you that nothing gives me greater pleasure than to see at 5 o&#x2019;clock the hundred and fifty people leaving my warehouse, and I know it pleases you as well.

<p>You don&#x2019;t produce cotton cheap enough in South Africa, and you cannot get cotton waste at all, and the Minister says they are made from cotton waste. The Minister says the outcry is exaggerated and due to self-interest, but only to this extent, that it is going to interfere with a large business done in East London, and surely you cannot be exaggerating when the duties are going to be increased as much as 300 per cent. Surely it is time to raise a protest when the duties are increased in that fashion. There is any amount of justification for the agitation and for the remonstrances which have been addressed to the Minister. The Minister read out certain figures relating to the profits of the distributors of these goods, and I have telegrams and letters from the Transkei. Here is one from the East London Chamber of Commerce&#x2014;</p>

<p>What do I care about the magistrates, they don&#x2019;t know anything about blankets. My hon. friends do not want cotton mills started. They want the natives to buy woollen blankets. The natives would buy them if they could afford to. Like other people, the native buys the best he can afford, some times a little better. The Minister will not get into his head the one point that the wages of the natives are limited. They simply buy cotton blankets because they cannot afford to buy woollen ones, and the consequence will be, under this new tariff, that they will be unable to buy anything at all, or, instead of two or three, they will only buy one. That is the position, and the Minister should understand it. He cannot force the consumption of woollen blankets, such as those made in the neighbourhood of Cape Town, and such as those proposed to be made at Harrismith. I am very sorry my hon. friend does not see his way to agree to this. This taxation is going to add to the unrest amongst the natives. It appears to me the Government have set out to irritate the natives as much as possible. They make the blankets more expensive and, under the colour bar Bill, they forbid them going into certain trades. Here you do your best, and I say it quite deliberately, to increase the cost of living to these people, because clothing is part of the cost of living.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>There is just one class of people in South Africa that exploit the natives for all they are worth, and that is the working men. Take the men on the goldfields. Would the mines be able to pay the wages they pay to the white men on the goldfields if you had not such a low wage paid to the natives? The white men there are paid the highest wages in the world, except America, and you could not make the mines pay unless you had the cheap labour of the natives. It is the working man every time in this country who exploits the natives. Hon. members seem to forget that, after all is said and done, an industry can only afford to pay a certain amount of wage. If you force it to pay more than it can afford, it closes down because it becomes insolvent. The working men of this country. I say quite deliberately, exploit the native more than any class of men do.</p>

<speech by="#allen">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALLEN</person>:</from>

<p>As a Labour representative in this House, I rejoice at one thing in the reply made by the Minister just now, and that is his authoritative statement that industries are built up and fostered, not by those possessors of shy capital, as we have hitherto been led to believe, but by the very poorest sections of the population. The Minister has made an official declaration in this House that to propagate a new industry in this country it us necessary that the lowest wage-earning class shall be taxed very substantially in order to provide a safe field for a new flood of capital <span class="col_5265-5266" refersTo="page_0477"/>coming into this country. We have always been told that a sympathetic Government and a very daring speculative investor will combine together to establish industries in a new country like this. As a Labour man, I rejoice very much at the very plain statement made by the Minister. His declaration would be reassuring if we had any attempt made at the present time to establish a cotton manufacturing industry in this country, but cotton manufacturing is an industry which covers a much wider field than has been adumbrated by the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. It is all very well for someone to write and say that they are ordering machinery from overseas for a cotton industry, but your cotton industry begins at the bottom, when you are handling the raw product, and it works up through various stages until you get to the weaving industry, so that it is going to be a long time before a cotton manufacturing industry of any magnitude is going to be established in this country, and I think it is wrong that the whole vicious circle should be perpetuated once again, because we have always had it demonstrated that wages are ever the last thing to follow a rise in the cost of living, and, when that cost of living becomes intolerable, wages are attacked as a first step to bring down the cost of living. Here we have the beginning of a similar vicious circle. When I mentioned this matter recently, I got what I hoped was an implied promise from the Minister. Evidently he has gone into it again, but I must say my hopes have been dashed. The trade in this class of commodity is a considerable one. It seems that it amounted in 1924 to £797.000. There again we can see that this trade is dealing with a purely limited demand (that of the native buyer) which does not amount to anything like the demand that would be created if we were actually manufacturing our own products here. But it is a trade that is continually increasing. It has increased to the extent of 52½ per cent. during the three years&#x2014;1921-1924&#x2014;so that it is very evident that there is a promising field for that particular industry but I submit that it is neither just nor equitable to place the onus for creating conditions favourable to the establishment of that industry on the class of people who are least fitted to stand the expenditure. It is not only a matter of compelling them to pay more, but, it is actually a matter of compelling these people to do without these commodities, which they are rightly, I think, entitled to by reason of their industry. I hone it is not too late for the Minister to reconsider his position, but I am afraid it is. I notice that Belgium is the chief competing country, and it is very rapidly gobbling up this trade, having in three years increased its trade by 79.7 per cent. against Britain&#x2019;s 46.4 per cent. I think the Minister might do something on more scientific lines to counteract that kind of thing, and protect articles which are produced in a country which manufactures under more decent conditions, and if a cotton industry is established in this country, I think a much better way of fixing a balance as between the imported article and the locally made article, would be to bond the article when produced, and as it is released for sale, subsidize it by a bounty.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>We, at any rate, although it is hitting the natives in the Cape Province very largely, accepted that taxation and supported it, although no doubt many of our constituents, when we go back, will have something to say to us in that matter. Here we have to-night an entirely different proposition. I hope the Minister will recognize that in protesting against the proposals now before us we are not entirely-looking to the native vote. I agree with the contention of the hon. member who has just spoken (Mr. Allen). I believe that the industries in this country must realize that they can only be built up upon the consumption of the large masses of the population, and we must realize that these industries must produce articles which are consumed to a considerable extent by the native. I sympathize largely with the attitude of the Minister in this particular case. I think if we can establish a cotton blanket industry in this country it would be a good thing for the country. But does the Minister realize that this taxation is going to hit only the native population? Does he realize that the measures which have been brought before this House recently are going to prevent the natives from working in those factories which are to produce these very articles that are to be consumed by the natives? Therefore, the natives will have a complaint at once. They will say that the white man is building up a trade on their backs. I do not think that at the present stage, seeing we are introducing this new legislation, it is advisable to do this sort of thing.. The second aspect I would like to put before the Minister is this, that the natives have passed through a very bad time in the last few years. The Minister has quoted the prices they paid during the war, but we all know that money then was very free. The native in those days was getting 2s. 6d. a pound for wool and for stock he was getting £10 or £15 for an ox or a cow. To-day he getting £2 or £3. The whole value of everything has dropped. To place extra taxation upon them to-day would give them every right to say we are not treating them fairly. I listened very interestedly to the remarks of the hon. member for Cape Town <span class="col_5267-5268" refersTo="page_0478"/>(Central) (Mr. Jagger) who is one of the big business men of this country, and I was astonished to find that he had such an intimate knowledge of native trading conditions in the Transkei; and I would like the Minister to go through the income tax returns of these traders and see if there is such a huge profit from the sale of these blankets and native truck as he seems to think. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) is absolutely right when he says that cotton blankets are sold at a bare profit. In every trade certain articles are sold at a narrow margin in order to attract trade, and cotton blankets are one of them. Where the Minister got his information from I do not know, but I am confident that the cotton blanket shows a very narrow margin of profit. I appeal to the Minister again on these grounds. Does he not realize there is no such thing as a cotton blanket factory established in this country? Surely we are not going to adopt the policy of putting a heavy tax on certain articles in the hone that some stray capitalist may come along and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Oh. I see there is a heavy tax on this; I will start a factory.</block>

<p>I do think the argument of the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander) is a perfectly fair one. Give the capitalists of this country, if they are prepared to start factories, an undertaking that if they can produce these articles at a reasonable price and quantity that this country will be prepared to protect those articles. The Minister must face this too. I do not know whether he wanted to drive cotton blankets out of the country and persuade the natives to wear woollen blankets or whether he wishes a cotton blanket factory to be started. He was not quite clear on this point. The average native is earning a very small wage, and a woollen blanket is an expensive article, while a cotton blanket is one of those things that are handed down, from child to child, exactly as we, in our young days, had to take the cast-off clothing of our elder brothers. The cotton blanket comes down until the poor little infant wears it in tatters. The natives are in this position to-day that they have not been taught to wear these better-class garments, and if you are going to drive cotton blankets out of the country what is the good of trying to start a factory? I have here a letter from a very important trader. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the present proposed tariff is imposed, cotton blankets are doomed, and a very serious loss of revenue must occur which we men of commerce will be called upon to make up in some other form of taxation.</block>

<p>There is no doubt about it. If you induce them to give up their cotton blankets what are they going to wear? Do not force them to give them up at the present time. Have a suspended tariff or some other means, but do not tax the natives in this way at the present time.</p>

<p>I am sorry to have to differ from the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Allen) I believe that we should support our industries by taxing the commodities entering this country. I do not believe the present system is perfect. I would rather see a tax on commodities, not for revenue, but for safeguarding the interests of the people of this country by levelling up the difference of the cost of production in other countries with the cost of production in this country. The time is not ripe for anything of that description, therefore a policy whereby the Minister puts a tax on other countries&#x2019; products, not only for revenue producing purposes but to encourage the industries of this country, should be supported by every fair member of this House. The idea in the past was that Australia would never be able to manufacture its own clothing, but from the statistics it is shown that the clothing used by the Police, the Defence Force and all the civil servants who wear uniform was made from cloth manufactured in Australia. They are able to do it, we shall be able to do it eventually. Besides that, we have a duty to perform; it is to find work for the people of South Africa; that is our first duty. As long as we have unemployed in this country we should endeavour to make that our first aim. I would rather have the clothes dear and the workers working than have the clothes cheap and have the workers without work and no money.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows perfectly well that he is not looking at the timing in an honest manner. He knows that Australia is absorbing 8,000 emigrants every month and naturally there must be unemployment there, but in this country we are getting very few emigrants, therefore we have a right to find work for all the people of South Africa. If we analyse other countries we find that those countries which have a fiscal policy based upon the principle of looking after their own people first they have had a surplus although the condition of the workers and of citizens in that country may not have been perfect. Still the fact remains that they are in a better condition than those countries which have neglected their first duty, that charity begins at home.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>As a protectionist who wants to see the establishment of industries in this country, I think we ought not to take only one road. We seem to think that the only way to protect industry is by way of a tariff. I noticed in this evening&#x2019;s paper that the Prime Minister of England, who is a strong protectionist, thinks that the industries of England could be expanded by bounties. The cotton industry, or the iron industry, if they are going to be extended, must be protected by some other measure than a tariff because their principal markets must be outside the Union. The cotton industry is one which we should aim at establishing in this country; because, as pointed out by the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander), we have the whole of Africa as our market. Belgium is producing the cheapest cotton blanket in the world, and if we are going to sell cotton blankets in the <span class="col_5269-5270" refersTo="page_0479"/>Belgian Congo, we will have to compete with Belgium. We cannot compete in outside markets by means of a tariff. The protection of the cotton industry will have to be by means of a bounty, such as we have already attempted in the iron industry. My own impression is that in the latter case the bounty was not high enough to attract capital. In the case of the cotton industry under discussion, I think it is unjust to endeavour to establish that industry at the expense of the poorest portion of the population. The protection should be borne by the whole community. I feel that there are ways we must explore for the establishment of industries, in connection with which we have to look for a market overseas, other than by means of a tariff.</p>

<speech by="#arnott">

<from>Brig.-Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ARNOTT</person>:</from>

<p>It is a well-known fact that there are only two countries in the world able to produce cotton blankets, namely, England and Belgium. Northern France produces the same kind of article as Belgium, but not such a good one. In that highly industrialized country, the United States, they tried to produce cotton blankets against England, but failed. There is something that the old country knows better than the rest of the world. Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Japan have all tried and failed. Cotton blankets, before the war, were sold in Manchester at just about the price of the raw cotton&#x2014;only about a ½d. difference&#x2014;and if you can produce them at that, good enough, but if not to all those hon. members who shouted, hear, hear, when the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs was reading out that letter, who are thinking of putting money into that cotton mill in Durban, my advice would be &#x201C;don&#x2019;t.&#x201D; You will lose it quickly. If we were to start a cotton industry, it should be to produce the coarse cotton cloth worn by the natives in the interior. It is a cheap cloth, easily woven, and does not require skilled machinery such as the fine cloths do. It is no good going in for waste material, such as the cotton blankets are made of. I must agree with the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), that the Minister of Finance has been far led away by the figures he has got. I have not been in the kaffir truck trade since 1912, but before that I retailed one and a quarter pound cotton blankets and sold thousands of them at 1s. 6d. and there was no 33 l/3rd percentage there. It is all humbug to say that you are going to build up an industry of that kind. You are merely chasing a shadow.</p>

<speech by="#hay">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>Before passing on to the schedule, I would like to ask the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) to read this morning&#x2019;s &#x201C;Cape Times&#x201D; where he will see that, according to the latest information, the United States of America had a surplus of revenue for the last financial year of £50,000,000 sterling&#x2014;not dollars&#x2014;and has no unemployment. Of course, that is a protected country, and if that is not convincing then there is no answering the hon. member for Cape Town (Central). All this about the poor native is very nice so far as it goes, but the native is already being initiated into the higher price. My information is that the trading class is not prepared to sell the stocks which they have under higher tariff prices; so that the native is being accustomed to this increase, and the trade is looking after himself. In many trades there are cut lines, sold below cost, perhaps, for trading purposes, and if a trader chooses to do that it is his business; but there is another aspect of the question. From the earliest times in which I have been associated with the native, I have always advocated the placing of special duties on the things he uses. Let him contribute his fair share to the revenue of the country and then he will ask for a fair rate of pay, this will put him on a better plane in competition with white labour. There has always been this temptation&#x2014;to let the native off cheaply&#x2014;that he should not be asked to pay, on the article he consumes, anything like the same proportion as the white man. I want to impress upon the Minister the absolute necessity for increasing the tariff on second-hand goods. These are a constant danger. I had some experience in connection with the sterilization of bed clothing and wearing apparel, in connection with hospitals and municipal work, and the most astounding things occurred. After three hours in the sterilization process, the things were opened up and sent for bacteriological investigation, and on examination disease germs were found, active and ready to carry on their work. The sterilization of imported second-hand apparel is not complete at all. It is perfunctory. Exporters get a certificate that it has been through such a process, which often means that it was put in after it was baled, and at any time this country may have to spend half a million on an epidemic introduced through this second-hand stuff. Why should we take the second-hand blankets and garments of Europe? They have their poor and instead of sending such goods here it would be better if they were to use them up in the country of production. I think the duty on all second-hand clothing should be absolutely prohibitive. By the importation of such things we are jeopardizing the health of the community, injuring the tailoring trade, and doing no good to anyone. I hope it is not too late to place a prohibitive duty on second-hand clothing and second-hand blankets; the importation of the latter being particularly atrocious.</p>

<p>I can tell the Minister quite plainly that he is putting us in a very difficult position. The amendment of the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) appeals very much indeed to me. An enormously increased duty is not going to stop the importation of these blankets for one <span class="col_5271-5272" refersTo="page_0480"/>moment, but it will increase the cost to the native very considerably, owing to the number of hands these blankets have to pass through before they reach the ultimate purchaser. It appears to me that the price to the natives will be tremendous. It may be argued that it is just as well to tax the native heavily in order that he may demand higher wages, but the process of obtaining bigger pay is a very dangerous and painful one, and I do not think it is quite practical politics. It is an illuminating thing that to-day we, a Parliament in the British Commonwealth of Nations, should calmly be considering the establishment of an industry designed to make cotton blankets, and that in one of the large wool producing countries of the world. Blankets should be manufactured from wool and not from cotton, which is a very unsatisfactory substitute. It is contemplated that a native is going to have a bed covering weighing about 12 ozs. What is the average price of wool&#x2014;is 15d. a low price per lb? It does not require much calculation to realize that a wool blanket would not cost very much for material if it weighed only 1 lb. or 1 lb. 4 ozs. We should turn our attention to advocating the manufacture of woollen blankets for natives. The Minister will be well advised to accept the suggested compromise, and not to stand to his guns.</p>

<p>Hon. members will agree with me that those who know the conditions under which the natives live, also know that many of the natives would prefer a cotton blanket to a woollen blanket. He does not want woollen blankets. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) smiles. I have been in the Transkei at all hours of the night, because that is one of the duties of the mounted police. We had to go through the huts at all hours of the night. For the native to be without woollen blankets is not a hardship, because he would sooner have a cotton blanket. They decorate them with buttons and dye them with red ochre, in fact they use them for clothing. We must face the position that either South Africa wants industries or it does not, and if we want them let us do what we can to establish industries, otherwise in a few years, when the mining industry perishes, South Africa will go to pieces, because we have nothing to take the place of the mining industry. Australia has done well, because while the gold mines were being worked they built up other industries to take the place of the gold mines. To-day we are in the parlous position that we can do nothing in connection with the mining industry in case we upset the whole country. We can understand the point of view of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), because he is an importer and believes in buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest. He even believes in importing his labour from overseas. I have seen a letter from a branch of his firm in Johannesburg where they sacked a South African because they had imported a man from overseas. But he is quite consistent in his ideas as an importer. Many of the hon. members are against protection, but they are in favour of bounties. Who is going to pay them? Unless we have a bounty system side by side with the system of tariffs, we may find that we are taxing the poorest of the community in South Africa to provide bounties, while leaving the door open to importation of products by sweated labour in other countries, because the burden of taxation always falls on a working man. The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls), when he said the Prime. Minister of England was in favour of protection but was also in favour of bounties, knew that the Prime Minister of England could not carry a tariff proposal through the Commons, or at any rate he would not have the community behind him. Let us not run away with the idea that the solution is the paying of bounties to industry. I hope hon. members will be prepared to face the position. We have a Board of Trade and they have had many compliments. Give them a trial. Whenever proposals are brought here in connection with tariffs there will always be members willing to point out the weak spots. Let us make up our minds that we are going to build up South African industries, produce the raw material in South Africa, have all the work done by South Africans, and that we are going to build up a United States of South Africa where the citizens are going to live on a decent standard of life, and we shall be proud to belong to the country, because we shall have satisfied citizens.</p>

<p>With the final statement of the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) I entirely agree, and also his penultimate statement, namely, that we want to see industries built up in this country. I think we all do, even so ardent a free trader as the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). I do not pretend to have the intimate kraal knowledge of the hon. member for Brakpan. I have not been prowling about at all hours of the night to see whether the native prefers a cotton to a woollen blanket. I suppose, at all events, that the native prefers to have the better article. What I got up to do <span class="col_5273-5274" refersTo="page_0481"/>was to answer the question propounded by my hon. friend (Mr. Waterston) to the House, and that is, who is going to pay the bounty? Just the same fellow who is going to pay these duties, with this difference that he won&#x2019;t have to pay so much. My hon. friend knows it quite well. I must now give the amended figures that I have worked out. My hon. friend, the member for Liesbeek (Mr. Pearce), was at one time in commercial life and no one knows better the intricacies of commercial life than he does, not even my hon. and wide-experienced friend, the member for Cape Town (Central)&#x2014;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MADELEY</person>:</from>

<p>I suppose I must pay the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) the compliment of accepting the position that he has been infinitely more successful than my hon. friend (Mr. Pearce) in working those intricacies. My hon. friend assured me that I was quite wrong in my factors in arriving at a result as to the amount which the ultimate payer has to pay on the tariff or customs. He said I was wrong in taking 25 per cent. My hon. friend, the member for Cape Town (Central), said that I was wrong in taking three intermediaries and that there were only two, or rather one, between the importer and the consumer. I have endeavoured to bring the two objections together. I have taken my hon. friend with his 33⅓ per cent. as being substantially correct&#x2014;and I think the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) will agree that it is so&#x2014;and I have taken the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) in his number of intermediaries and we have this, that the £400.000 that the Minister estimates he is going to get from this new tariff when paid by the consumer amounts to £711,110. If that £400 000 is necessary to bolster up industry which it is supposed to be doing-, though in some cases it is not, you would only require under the bounty system a bare £400.000, with the additional advantage that the House would always have it under its review, and would know precisely where it was going and how much was going. But you have the haphazard conditions of not knowing, once you have imposed a tariff, all its ramifications. We have this position that if you impose duties amounting to £400 000. the consumer has to pay £711,110 and, taking the whole of the customs revenue at £8.000 000 in round figures, it means that an amount of £14.000 000 odd has to be paid by the consumers of this country in order to realize that £8,000 000. Is it not perfectly clear that the same people pay the amount, and that all we are divided upon is as to the method in which this amount shall be paid, and I am prepared to plump for the bounty system, because you know the amount you have to raise in revenue, you know beforehand the amount of protection that you give, and the consumer knows where he is. Under the tariff system people may not know how much they are paving in the globular amount, in the sum total, but it will be very difficult to explain to the housewife why it is that this article and that article are costing more, while the told man&#x2019;s monthly cheque remains the same.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW</person>:</from>

<p>This is also one of these sections where the British preference has been dropped, and where it has been asked for at the economic conference. I am sorry it has been dropped, because if anyone needs helping at the present moment it is the Lancashire people. I am sorry for another reason, and that is that we are buying from Belgium. I would like to see these blankets from Belgium analysed to see whether they contain lead. Can you make cotton blankets at Durban? I doubt it, because they cannot be made properly anywhere in the world except Lancashire. In America they are a failure. In Australia they are a failure. Ask the hon. member for Roodepoort (the Rev. Mr. Mullineux) who is the cotton expert in this House. Let us ask him if they can make cotton blankets anywhere out of Lancashire. Is this tariff going to keep other cotton blankets out? Of course it is not. Even this high tariff will not keep the blankets made in Belgium out of this country. What it will do, will be to put the cost up to the man who cannot afford to pay, and the blankets will get worse and worse. The Minister of Posts and Telegraphs was very courageous&#x2014;although, of course, we know he is a courageous man; he stroked a lion&#x2014;when he told us there is going to be a cotton blanket factory at Durban. I hope I shall live to see it. Where are they going to get their cotton from? They will have to import it. To compete with Belgium you would have to produce cotton at 9d. per lb. to make anything out of it. I would like to see our farmers produce cotton at 9d. per lb. The best thing with matters like this is to let the goods come in as free as possible to the poor people. I am very sorry the Minister cannot see our way of thinking to have a suspended duty. First see if you can build this factory and produce these wonderful things; but to first put on the duty, and then wait for the factory to come from fairyland, I think is a wrong policy altogether.</p>

<speech by="#payn">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to draw attention to item 76 on the list&#x2014;piece goods not being blanketing or kaffir sheeting, which is being charged 10 per cent. to 12 per cent. Kaffir sheeting is also material that is manufactured from cotton, and it must be material containing 50 per cent. or more of cotton. The material is exactly the same as under item 61 (c), only that it is being consumed by Europeans. It is not fair that the Minister should make that differentiation, and I appeal to him to place this also on the suspended list. It seems to me the correct way to establish a new industry, and if such can be built up, I will go whole-heartedly with the Minister and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Protect it.</block>

<p>In order to establish industries in this country. But he should not put a prohibitive tariff on the article which the kaffir only is using as such a course is open to misconstruction.</p>

<from><span class="col_5275-5276" refersTo="page_0482"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The reason for the course we have adopted is that if we had not taken the sheeting out of the previous class it could be sold as blankets and defeat the whole object of the previous item. If you tax the kaffir blanket and let the sheets come in, they will be sold for the same purpose.</p>

<speech by="#christie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHRISTIE</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister if he cannot see his way to meet this position. After all, the whole argument has been the desire to encourage industries and it seems to me that with a 15 per cent. suspended duty the Minister ought to have all he requires in that connection. I would ask that he give this due consideration, otherwise it does seem to us, in view of the difficulties in establishing such an industry&#x2014;with all due respect to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, who has been telling of the likelihood of such an amount of machinery being ordered to set this up&#x2014;one can look well ahead before that can be a really effective method of making these blankets in this country. I do not subscribe to the statement that only in Lancashire can these blankets be made, but I do say that it is going to be many years before these blankets can be made in such a way that the consumer&#x2014;the native in particular&#x2014;will feel the alteration and during the transitory stage this is only going to be a taxing operation, not a protective tariff at all. It is simply a matter of raising revenue, and is not going to have any effect in encouraging this industry. My idea, and I think the Labour party are with me, is that in supporting a protective tariff it is to encourage industry, but this tariff is simply taxing people who can least afford to pay that particular tax. I feel that the Minister ought to go into this matter further, and I suggest that he leave over the consideration of this item to a later stage. I think that is a fair request, and will give us an opportunity to consider more carefully what this will mean, not only to this House to-night but to the people in the country for the next few years.</p>

<speech by="#kentridge">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Minister will accede to the suggestion put forward by the hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. Christie). I hope he will hold the item over until he can consult with his advisers and ascertain what the position will be. Either this particular duty is intended purely for revenue purposes&#x2014;in which case I am definitely against it&#x2014;or it is intended to establish a cotton blanket industry in South Africa. If it is intended entirely for revenue purposes it will not have the desired effect, for the very illuminating figures the Minister quoted to us showed how the wholesale and retail people have been exploiting the natives and make it apparent that the only effect of imposing this particular duty will be that the merchants and retailers will pass on the additional customs duty to the consumer, plus the interest and the profit on the higher price. The Minister quoted the position of these articles during the war, but he omitted to state that at that time, in addition to the fact that the consumers had to pay so much extra for these articles there was a tremendous shrinkage in the use of these things. So if the effect of a higher price is going to cause, as I anticipate, a shrinkage in the use of the articles the Minister will lose the additional revenue he expects to receive as the result of higher duties on these importations. If, on the other hand, this increased duty is to be used for the purpose of establishing an industry here&#x2014;I think I am speaking for all the Labour members when I say we are behind no-one in our desires to see South Africa become self-supporting&#x2014;then one has to look at these things from a reasonable point of view. One would not suggest the imposition of a prohibitive tariff for the purpose of establishing an industry for which we have not the raw material, or even if it were established it would become a hybrid industry like match making in Natal, where they used to import the wood and the sulphur and to employ the cheapest possible coolie labour. I rather suspect that the cotton industry of which the Minister of Posts told us, would be such a hybrid industry. We don&#x2019;t want a repetition of that. The material for the manufacture of these blankets, mainly shoddy, has to be imported. The only reasonable way to encourage the manufacture of these things in South Africa would be by the bounty system, under which the country would only pay on what was produced, or else the suspended duty which would be imposed when the manufacturers were prepared to employ labour on reasonable conditions. If on the other hand he is trying to take advantage of the tariff for the purpose of importing the necessary shoddy, because that is what most of the stuff will be, and using the cheapest possible labour, then I say an industry of that kind is of no value to South Africa and will not benefit the white people. The only effect of the tariff will be to reduce the number of blankets used by the people and it will have the effect of diverting the trade from one part of Europe to another. Let me read the figures for 1924. During 1924 we imported cotton blankets from the United Kingdom to the value of_ £388,000, from Belgium, with its convict labour and sweated conditions, £189,000, from France with its falling franc £44,000, from Germany, with its unsatisfactory labour conditions, £54,000 and from Italy, with its Mussolini, £63,000. Without hesitation I submit the only effect of this tariff will be to divert that trade from the United Kingdom where labour conditions are better, to places like Italy and Belgium where conditions are bad. I don&#x2019;t think the Minister desires that state of affairs and I hope he will take into consideration the request to hold this matter over for further consideration.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say a few words on this; I might just as well point out what the consequences of some of these proposals are. It is somewhat difficult to understand on what principle this tariff has been drawn up, because I see that No. 9, buckets, household and sanitary, the duty there has been increased practically from 17 per cent. to 25 per cent. When I look over at page 11. No. 132, I see that perambulators and baby carts have been reduced from 17 per cent. to 10 per cent. It is pretty evident, I should think, that the gentlemen who drew up this tariff are either young men going to be married or young men with families; because I have noticed the same thing in regard to several items; for instance, it has been remarked that the duty on babies&#x2019; foods has been reduced somewhat. Here are buckets, household and sanitary&#x2014;</p>

<p>Then there are milk cans and buckets, cheese cloths and so forth, increased from 3 per cent. to 20 per cent.&#x2014;in fact, they were practically free, because there was a rebate of 3 per cent. I hone the farmers will agree to this, out of patriotism. There is only one industry for this particular article, and that is in East London, and you are going to tax the farmers of the whole country for this industry; but if they like it is all right. Then I see motor cars. It comes to this, that you are going to tax the English car more than the American car.</p>

<p>Many farmers have gone in for them, and others besides cheque book farmers. I think this is a backward step. The old duty was 3 per cent. with a rebate of 3 per cent. and now it is 20 per cent. Then there is another point, and here I am going to move an amendment. Item 155, page 12. 3 inch mesh fencing, that is jackal proof, is free; but fencing of any other mesh is raised from 3 per cent. to 5 per cent. and 15 per cent. It simply means that fencing with a smaller mesh, which is used for poultry, has to pay 15 per cent. There is no sense or reason in taxing wire netting which happens to be of a smaller mesh than three inches. I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In item 155. sub-item (c), to omit &#x201C;15 per cent.&#x201D; in the fourth and fifth columns, respectively, and to substitute &#x201C;3 per cent.&#x201D;</block>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>Here is where my hon. friend and I must part company. It was only when I thought the Government was going on wrong lines that I differed from them, but in this case the Government is proceeding on right lines. For some years I have brought up the question of encouraging the building of motor car bodies in this country, but my voice was as of one &#x201C;crying alone in the wilderness.&#x201D; The building of wagons and carts used to be a very big industry in South Africa, but with <span class="col_5279-5280" refersTo="page_0484"/>the growing use of motor vehicles this industry is gradually disappearing. The people employed in that industry could very easily devote their energies to the construction of motor car bodies. Motor car chassis should be allowed to come in free. In Australia I believe you are not allowed to import a new motor car without at the same time importing at least one chassis, and I am told that in the vast majority of cases only chassis are imported into that country. The big motor people have sent their people to Australia and have started motor body building factories. If you make the tariff effective you would have the Ford and other companies building such factories in South Africa for the making of motor bodies here. The special tariff proposed for chassis is a step in the right direction. Now, with regard to wire netting. There is one industry we have been pleading for in this House for years, and that is the wire fencing and netting industry.</p>

<speech by="#alexander">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>In history one man has been able to do a great deal. The farmers in this House realize the value of this netting. Ask the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet (Mr. I. P. van Heerden). This one firm, the Premier Gate, Fence and Wire Company, Limited, has been turning out wire fencing and netting far better than that imported. That is his view, and he is a progressive farmer. Farmers must realize with regard to things required on a farm that it is their duty to help those men who are struggling along in manufactures. Under the Minister&#x2019;s new proposal the three-inch mesh remains, but the limitations as to width and guage are unfortunately taken away in the case of fencing. Protection has been given in the case of other fencing and netting, but the three-inch mesh comes in free, and now my hon. friend wants to considerably reduce the protection given. The firms are struggling against large manufacturers overseas who are trying to crush them out. Imported netting in South Africa to-day is dumped at a much cheaper price than in England. As soon as they have crushed this firm out of existence the price will go up all round. This factory is in Cape Town, and I wish hon. members would go and visit it. Brackets used in the railway carriages come from that factory, and the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) would be surprised if he knew how much, as Minister of Railways, he bought from that factory. Some of the finest things you have in netting you have there. Jackal netting, one of the best parts of their production, comes in duty free. They ask for a duty on this to be put on the suspended list, and as soon as they get protection you will have every bit of jackal fencing manufactured in the Union. Seventy-five per cent. of their machines are built to manufacture the three-inch mesh with the guage and width as originally proposed. I will tell you why they should have protection. If you take that out they might as well close down. If the Government will not put the jackal proof fencing on the suspended list then there should be some system of bounties introduced. I can assure hon. members that if the slightest encouragement is given to this particular industry, then you are going to have the whole of South Africa getting its wire material for all purposes from the Union. I have the authority of the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet (Mr. I. P. van Heerden) and other members who have been to see this factory, for saying that these things are used on farms and that the article produced in this factory in Cape Town is cheaper and better than the imported article.</p>

<p>Why do you require protection then?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#alexander">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>I was just telling the hon. member why. Because the big manufacturers in England and abroad have come to the conclusion that the South African industry must not be allowed to exist, and they are dumping these things in South Africa. The whole reason why they are asking for protection is because the big manufacturers overseas have come to the conclusion that this industry here is a menace to them and they want to get rid of it. I hope the Minister will not only keep this item on his programme, but that he will see his way to giving them more protection in the future. The Minister has done what, I am sure, will be a lasting benefit to this country, and also to the manufacturers.</p>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>Although I believe in protecting industry, and as a protectionist, I have no fault to find with Item 155 (c), in regard to Item (a) which the last speaker (Mr. Alexander) would like to see again have a duty put on it, I want to say this, that, however important this one industry may be, in giving it protection, we must recognize that, having the country jackal-proofed to the fullest extent possible, and as rapidly as possible, is more important than that protection. Owing to strong representations made to the Minister in regard to this item, he has allowed any width of netting used for jackal fencing to enter duty free. The last speaker says that we can now put up jackal-netting fences &#x201C;any height we like.&#x201D; The real reason for this extension is that 5 feet netting is necessary for large portions of the country, where stones are absent or scarce, the lowest foot being used for turning down so as to prevent the jackals from getting through, instead of using stone packing. With regard to the amendment of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). I would point out that the amount of wire netting used for poultry runs is not very large, and I hope he will not persist in his amendment. It is absolutely essential to get this country fenced with jackal-proofed fencing as soon as possible and as cheaply as possible. With regard to the tax on motor-cars. I would like to ask the Minister whether he does not think be is rather retarding progress, because, after all, the motor-car to-day is not a matter of luxury, but a very necessary vehicle for farmers and business men, both as passenger cars or for transport. I think if <span class="col_5281-5282" refersTo="page_0485"/>he had left the tax on the old basis, he would have given all the protection necessary there. I want to ask the Minister whether he can consider item 129 (d), second-hand cars brought in by individuals. We want people to come into this country. Say a man has a car and some furniture; don&#x2019;t you think where it is his bona fide property a man coming into the country to settle might be let off with a very much lower duty than you have down here now? I know a case of a man who has come out here to settle. He had bought his car at a certain price, and showed his invoice to the customs officials, but the latter queried it and put an entirely arbitrary value on the car, and charged him a high duty. I would like the Minister to consider whether he cannot make a remission there. Under this same hardware section come cutlery and certain furniture. There again I would suggest to the Minister that, in order to make it easier for people coming into this country to settle and make their homes here, people whom both sides of the House have said they welcomed to this country, they should be allowed to bring in a certain amount of stuff duty free. We have people coming in with heirlooms and plate and silver which they have had for generations in their families, and household effects generally, and they have to pay very high duties on these. Would it not be possible to make a discrimination between the man smuggling in stuff for sale, and the man who is bringing in what has been his property for years, and who is vouched for by a reputable and recognized organization as being a bona fide prospective settler? I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider doing something of that sort. Allow a man, say, £250 worth of personal and household effects free of duty, if he is married allow a further amount of £100 worth for his wife, and allow say, a total amount of £500 worth, with a sliding scale of allowance for any children.</p>

<p>Yes, I am very sorry to think that he tries to put a difficulty in the discussion of every item stating they should come in free, then he takes up a different attitude when it comes to the Government reducing the duty on perambulators, because they are encouraging or assisting, to a certain extent, the family man. As regards wire netting, big manufacturers in England and America have, in the past, manufactured this netting and sold it at a commercial value in the respective countries. But they found out that, by increasing their output, they did not increase their overhead charges; they found, in the case of wire netting that, by keeping their machinery going from one day to another, they made a greater profit, even if they sold the surplus in foreign countries at a lower price than the price at which it was sold in their own country. What will be the result, if we allow this dumping? It will simply mean that we shall not be able to create and build up any industry in this country. It is true that imports are subject, to a certain extent, to dumping charges; but, on the other hand, they are able, as I have mentioned, to sell in other countries much cheaper than in their own. We find that, in recent years, certain companies have re-imported commodities into England and sold it at a price less than that at which the manufacturer was selling it in England, the country of its origin, really proving that this increase of output, selling at a lower rate, was detrimental to other countries, therefore I believe that we should not only put a tax on the manufactured goods that come into this country, but especially enforce it where they are selling at a lower rate than in their own country.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to make an appeal to the Minister. Latterly farmers, as well as commercial people, have been finding how essential it is, in their business, to use motor vans and tractors. Large numbers of farmers are going in for these motor tractors. The Minister proposes to increase the duty to 20 per cent. If that is done, it will place a very heavy handicap not only upon the commercial class who use their vans but upon the farmers. I would also like to make an appeal in connection with motor cars. The majority of the motor cars (of £400 and under as provided for in the schedule) pay a duty of 20 per cent. and the cars exceeding £400 up to £600 pay 22 per cent and over £600 25 per cent. If the Minister will enquire, he will find that, for some considerable time before this tariff was published, there were American motor car interests that were not at all unmindful of their business in this country and the possibility of furthering it. I feel perfectly certain that the proposed new duty is going to give a special preference to the American motor car to the detriment of the English car which costs more money because it is a more sound and lasting article. We have cut down the preference to a very large extent. The Minister is not going to assist the British manufacturer by giving them easy terms, so far as motor bicycles are concerned, as the British have the control of the Motor cycle trade, but the Minister is going to put an exceedingly heavy handicap on the British car manufacturer. I hope the Minister will reconsider this before the Bill comes before the House. I am as anxious as the hon. member for Liesbeek (Mr. Pearce) is to encourage legitimate South African manufacturing industries and by that I mean industries using <span class="col_5283-5284" refersTo="page_0486"/>a large proportion of raw material produced in this country. It is absolutely necessary if you are going to place our wool industry on an equal basis with that of Australia or the Argentine that vermin proof fencing should be more extensively used. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been invested in the last few years in the erection of vermin proof fencing which is revolutionizing farming operations. It would be a very serious thing to place a heavy handicap on the farmers by putting a duty on vermin proof fencing, for the farmers should be encouraged to enclose their holdings with the least possible delay with vermin-proof fencing. If a duty of 15 per cent. is placed on vermin proof fencing it would be a very serious obstacle to its more extensive use. The Drought Commission was unanimous in recommending that the Government should give every possible assistance to encourage farmers to fence their holdings. In the Colesberg or Hanover districts, there are hundreds of miles of jackal proof fencing five feet high which is answering admirably.</p>

<p>I would like to ask a question of the Minister with reference to the 20 per cent. duty on motor vans and motor trucks. In item 147 I see steam wagons come in free. For what reason is this difference made? In support of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) I quite appreciate jackal proof fencing coming in free. It is of undoubted benefit to the farmer. We should also have some consideration for the poultry farmer. I do not see why the poultry farmer, starting a new industry likely to be of great importance to this country, should be handicapped by this duty of 15 per cent.</p>

<p>I am sorry to disagree with the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt). He says he is not prepared to support any industry unless they start by using the raw products of the country. They gave England a preference of 3 per cent. when England was not using the raw material of that country. They were importing it from abroad. The hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat) wants to protect the poultry farmer. There are other sections of the community not considered when we put heavy duties on. The party to be protected here is the farmer, who was sufficiently protected in the tariff on page 387 before the change was made. What the industry really objects to this: That wire netting made in England and sold there at 28s. 6d. is sold in this country at 21s. That is dumping pure and simple. I have information that wire has even been quoted in this country at 19s., the same wire as sold in England at 28s. 6d. If you are out to protect industries, you must protect industries all round. This industry has had no protection in the past. In the first instance the Minister protected wire over 4 ft. Why do away with that? Here we have an industry which has been struggling for a long while, an industry in which a lot of money has been spent, an industry which is employing a large number of men, and yet we do not give it any protection. I want to appeal to the Minister, that if it is the principle of the Government to protect industries, let him be consistent and give this industry a certain amount of protection.</p>

<p>I would like to say a word about wire netting. I am a farmer, and I think I know a little about it also. There are very few people living about the towns who know what an enormous amount of wire netting is being used in the country, and no factory which you have got here can supply one-tenth or even one-hundredth of their requirements. Then you have got wire and wire. Although you may be importing the best drawn wire from Europe to this country, you may not be making the best wire netting. I do not think the factories here are equipped so as to enable them to properly carry out the last and most important process. I do not wish to say anything against this industry, but I do not think we are justified in asking all the users of netting wire here to pay a heavy duty to maintain a small factory.</p>

<p>I do not like this method of protection, but, having accepted this new tariff, I would like to put this to the hon. member who spoke just now (Mr. Heatlie). He animadverted against a tariff on wire netting, because he said it was going to cost the farmer more. Does he know the historic example of the Standard Oil Trust? Foolish people who thought they were getting oil cheap for the moment bought it and allowed all these people to be shut down, and then the company did <span class="col_5285-5286" refersTo="page_0487"/>exactly as they liked. The only stumbling block in the way of the hon. member for Worcester (Mr. Heatlie) and his farming friends is this little firm itself. If the Minister were to withdraw this protection from all the wire netting he would soon find out what would happen. What I am afraid of is that you are going to help to-night what are called the &#x201C;big five&#x201D; of wire netting manufacturers in England, and if you do close this factory down South Africa would be an open field for the &#x201C;big five&#x201D; and South Africa would have to pay what they pleased. Cut out competition&#x2014;although I am not much of a lover of competition&#x2014;and then the people from whom competition is removed bleed the people to whom they are selling their commodities. That is going to be the position in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) made a touching appeal to the hon. member for Liesbeek (Mr. Pearce) to go through various parts and see the tremendous amount of wire netting used. It is becoming a recognized thing for farmers, especially those with sheep, to reinforce with wire netting, but how much difference is it going to make? How much difference is the tariff going to make to these people at all events, because we have the prices before us and it is a very few shillings difference that is made in a 50 yards roll. These people can well afford to pay that in order to save themselves from the consequences once this little firm&#x2019;s competition is cut out. The best way to protect, after all, is to protect by means of paying a bounty.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">McMENAMIN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to appeal to the Minister to remodel No. 129 with the idea of giving practical effect to his evident intention of assisting the motor body building industry. The treasurer, in order to encourage the motor trade, suggests a 10 per cent. preference, but I contend that will be quite ineffective. Let us consider the example of Australia. The duty on motor bodies was first imposed there in 1911, and in the case of single seated bodies there was a duty of £17, and on double seated bodies of £24 10s.; but that had no real effect. It had the same effect as the treasurer&#x2019;s preference in our case will have. There was no business done at all, and in 1921, the Government, realizing that the preference given was a dead letter, increased the tariff as follows: On single seated bodies £40. on double seated bodies £60. or an ad valorem duty of 55 per cent. The result of that was immediate. Factories sprang up all over the country, and some of the big motor concerns were forced to come into the country to protect their trade. To-day, motor car body building is a big industry in Australia. All the favourite cars in Australia can be purchased either with locally made or imported bodies, and in some instances there is a difference of from £20 to £50 by buying the local body. The motor industry is really in its infancy, but already in South Africa, on this year&#x2019;s contracts, there are something like 15,000 cars coming into the country, and if we manufactured the bodies for these we would immediately have an industry representing a million and a half pounds annually. I am sure it is an industry which would be practicable in South Africa; but it will never be so unless the treasurer goes the whole way and puts on a really protective duty, and the only way we can do that is to remodel item 129 with the idea of allowing chassis to come in at the present rate of 20 per cent. and then allowing for the bodies. This mere 10 per cent. preference will never lead us anywhere. The policy I have suggested would be a practical one as against the ideal one which been brought before the House by the Minister.</p>

<p>I just wish to express the hope that the hon. Minister will not agree to the tax being put on imported fencing wire. It is one of the articles which is used not to the extent of hundreds of thousands of pounds but millions of pounds. All the farmers are convinced of it that there is only one way of successfully farming with sheep and that is to fence in the sheep farmers and it would be a very wrong policy to tax this kind of wire. I am very glad that the original proposal of the hon. Minister has been altered. The original intention was only to allow &#x201C;fifteen&#x201D; thickness of wire to come in free and to tax &#x201C;fourteen&#x201D; thickness, but that has been altered and all the wire of three inch width can now come in free. I will give the hon. Minister the assurance that the farmers appreciate this very much.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat) has raised question of the steam wagons that are ad mitted free of duty, as against the motor trucks which have to pay a fairly heavy duty. The steam wagons are used in out of the way places. They are a heavy article replacing the traction engines formerly used by the farmers, while the motor tractor is used in towns for the conveyance of goods, etc. In the case of motor trucks there is a body to be built. In the case of motor trucks without bodies the duty is only 5 per cent. The hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. McMenamin) has raised the question of the advisability of increasing the duty on chassis in order to establish a body building industry here. I am afraid we cannot take the example of Australia where they sell a very much larger number of cars than is the case here. This is an experiment and he shall have to see how it is going to work. The board has gone very carefully into the matter and these are the recommendations they have made. The representatives of a firm, which came here some time ago to establish a motor car assembling station, pointed out to us that they were very anxious to increase their operations, but whereas they sell 30,000 cars in Australia, here they sell only 4.000. We import <span class="col_5287-5288" refersTo="page_0488"/>only 15,000 cars of all makes per year, so any firm which desires to establish assembling stations here will have to spend a lot of money While we are not going as far as Australia has gone, we will see how things go and perhaps we may revise our policy later on, but I don&#x2019;t think it will be advisable to do it now. The right hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) has urged that the motor car is no longer a matter of luxury. It is true that the motor car is coming more and more into extended use, but I must get revenue some where. We have reduced the duties on articles used by farmers in many instances. The right hon. gentleman has raised the question of the sliding scale of duties on cars. He thinks that we are going to benefit the American motor car manufacturer at the expense of the English manufacturer. I do not see why that should be so. There are light English as well as light American cars and heavy American cars as well as heavy English cars. I am afraid the difficulty with the English motor car manufacturer is this&#x2014;he will not study our conditions and our bad roads, but sends us a heavy car of light power. I am afraid we shall not be able to rectify that with our customs duties, and that we snail not be able to make the position easier for English car manufacturers unless they supply us with what the country wants. I do not think the right hon. member is fair in trying to suggest that these recommendations have been framed in order to benefit the American car manufacturer.</p>

The effect of having for the cars under £400 a duty of 20 per cent. and from £400 to £600 from 22 per cent. to 25 per cent. is going to penalize the English car which is, in many cases, a better article, like English machinery, and if a man could afford to pay for it, he would get better life out of it than he would out of the other cars.</p>
