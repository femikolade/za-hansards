<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, last night we had a hysterical outburst by the hon. member for Rondebosch. This is, of course, in accordance with his behaviour, both as an academic and as a politician. When he was a lecturer at the University of Stellenbosch, he spoke politics in the classroom. Now, since he has come into Parliament, he talks nonsense in this House. He is the constitutional expert of the PFP. Let us now take a look at what his constitutional talents have brought forth. He has gone the full cycle, from one qualified vote, just once and never again, to venturing onto the terrain of a national convention. Ultimately the hon. member for Parktown says, at this point, that the pressure for a majority vote has now become so heavy that one will have to accept it, even if it is used irresponsibly.</p>

<p>That is an incorrect quotation, but never mind.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then the hon. member should put it right. If it is incorrect, the hon. member should put it right. However, allow me to take it further. The hon. member for Rondebosch spoke in the defence of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. His defence of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition consists fundamentally of the statement that no substantiating evidence exists for the allegation which has been made against the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and that everything that was said, was based on insinuation and innuendo. According to him, that is a new element which is now being brought into politics, viz. that people are judged on the grounds of innuendo and insinuation. That sounds strange, coming from a member of a party which has polluted public life in this country for many months, without evidence, by blackening people&#x2019;s names. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us take a look at what happened. Hon. members opposite have changed the legal system as far as the law of evidence is concerned in South Africa, in the sense that according to them, a person is not innocent until his guilt has been proved, but that he is guilty until he has proved his innocence. Let us now, just for a single moment, apply this rule of law, which was designed by those hon. members as a new part of our judicial system, to the case under discussion by putting the defence advanced by the hon. member for Rondebosch on behalf of his leader to that test. I should say here and now that only a young man like him would put up such a weak defence. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us just take a look at how the scene unfolds. If the circumstances had not been so difficult, and if it had not been so tragic that an hon. member of this House could have done what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has indeed done, one could even find it amusing.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, those hon. members are obviously engaged in obstruction. No one wants to deprive any political party or a member of such a party of the right to derive political advantage from the embarrassment of his opponent. No one disputes that the circumstances surrounding the former Department of Information, as well as the people who were involved in it, affords hon. members of the Opposition such an opportunity, and I am sufficiently realistic to accept that they will make use of this opportunity. However, allow me to remind the hon. members of the actions of the Government. Allow me to remind them of the fact that it was the result of the actions of the Government <span class="col_4095-4096" refersTo="page_0443"/>by making reports available to the hon. Opposition, which enabled them to launch and motivate their attack on the Government side. I should just like to remind those hon. members, too, that it was the Government side which took the step of calling a special session of Parliament. To do what? To give hon. members opposite the opportunity, in privileged circumstances, to discuss that report. However, what did they do with it?</p>

<p>What did they do with that opportunity? What are they making of the present Parliamentary session? They are making of it an opportunity to commit slander against people without being exposed to the consequences of unlawful behaviour. Therefore those hon. members should not blame us when we question their <i>bona fides</i> in this particular respect.</p>

<p>I should like to state that there is no doubt about the fact that this stain on the country&#x2019;s administration, as reflected in the activities of the former Department of Information, has hurt the Government, and neither is there any doubt about the fact that we made it known. Those hon. members should realize, however, that they are now no longer hurting the NP. They are now hurting South Africa, and I should like to submit that there are hon. members in the official Opposition who understand and realize this.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I think there are people in that party who object to these methods. However, let us take it further. This debate is one of the important opportunities for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to prove the quality of his leadership and to outline and proclaim the quality of his alternative policy for the administration of the country.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at the amendment introduced by the hon. member&#x2019;s party. I find it very interesting that after beginning by referring to the economy, it goes on to mention relations politics and, thirdly and fourthly, refers to the living conditions of people, and only in the fifth instance mentions the Information scandal. I have to draw certain conclusions from this. I have to conclude in the first place, that the hon. member&#x2019;s points of criticism are stated in order of their importance. Any process of logical deduction forces one to conclude this. The party of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition therefore placed the circumstances surrounding the former Department of Information as the last point of criticism. However, what does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition do? He takes that subordinate element in his amendment to the motion of the hon. Minister of Finance, and spends nearly an hour of his speech on it.</p>

<p>Colin, there is a telephone call for you. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite probably a call from abroad. [Interjections.] The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Rondebosch are always stressing the intensity and the sensitivity of the relations issues in this country. One would therefore have expected that they would make use of this opportunity to formulate their attitude in this regard. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, however, does not talk about his view of South Africa for the future, but gossips about Information. He does not outline to this House the alternative which he as Leader of the Opposition envisages for South Africa. No. Sir. He collaborates with the outside world, which expects South Africa to be prepared to accept models which have to satisfy people who are not seeking political rights, but who wish to put megalomaniacs in power. The integrity of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition as a member of the House is at issue. I wish to question it. I wish to tell him that his integrity&#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on a point of order: Is the hon. the Minister allowed to question the integrity of another member of this House?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I do not think the hon. the Minister has questioned the hon. member&#x2019;s integrity.</p>

<p><span class="col_4097-4098" refersTo="page_0444"/>*I shall, however, listen carefully to what the hon. the Minister says further. The hon. the Minister may proceed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to submit that the behaviour of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition leaves him with one of three alternatives. Firstly, if anything still remains of what we expect from members of this House, he should resign. If he does not want to do that, he should ask for a Select Committee, because I am questioning his integrity. Thirdly, he could submit a sworn statement in which he states what he discussed with Mr. McHenry.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He will swear to nothing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The conventions of the House are very clear that when <i>prima facie</i> evidence exists which brings into question the integrity of a member, any action to be taken rests with such a member.</p>

</speech>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall call witnesses. [Interjections.] The question now arises whether one can expect such honourable action from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I should say at once that I have a problem in this regard, because after all, one probably has to make allowances for people whose hatred of their opponents is greater than their love of their country, in respect of levels or standards of integrity. Perhaps I overestimated the hon. member&#x2019;s norms in this regard in the past. If I have done that, I owe the House an apology.</p>

<p>Let us now consider whether the reply of the hon. member for Rondebosch is well-founded. I should like to tell him that if it had not been so amusing, it would have been childish. Surely he knows that the campaign launched over the past few months by the Press which supports them and which parroted them mindlessly, was nothing but a mass trial in the market place where innocent people were found guilty and guilty people became the witnesses.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In this regard one may refer to the allegations made by the hon. members for East London North and Pietermaritzburg South. The innuendos and insinuations aimed at the hon. the Minister of Finance, cry to heaven and these allegations, innuendos and insinuations were made in spite of a finding by a judge. I think the hon. member for Yeoville should know that questioning the integrity of a Minister of Finance does not harm his person, but in fact the country he represents. Why does he not object to that? At least he has a legal background. The hon. member for Parktown has an interest in this country, a bigger interest than most other people. Why does he not object to this? [Interjections.] They laugh.</p>

<p>I am laughing at the suggestion that I am supposedly so wealthy. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that the hon. member is wealthy, but that he has interests in this country.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at the charges causing me to question the integrity and honour of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I should like to say that while bringing a charge against the Leader of the Opposition, I am keeping in mind the defence of the hon. member for Rondebosch. The first allegation against the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is that in contravention of all rules and practices, he approached Mr. McHenry to make an appointment for him with Dr. Waldheim. This reflects a pattern, for he avoided the normal channels not only when he approached Mr. McHenry, but also when he visited England and other countries. The hon. member for Yeoville knows what one does in this regard. He does it himself. He ought therefore to object to his leader&#x2019;s behaviour, because it follows a pattern of behaviour. However, this is not all. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition denies that he asked Mr. McHenry to make an appointment for him with Dr. Waldheim. His denial still stands today. I have read what he said in the House. He denies it, and by doing so, he told the House an untruth.</p>

<p>What is the evidence in this particular regard? Mr. McHenry and Mr. Eksteen confirmed that he wished to make an appointment. Mr. Donald Sole confirmed it by saying that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself told him, Mr. Sole, that he had attempted to arrange an appointment with Waldheim through Mr. McHenry. However, he denies it. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>&#x2020;Does he deny that he discussed it with Mr. Sole? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>He should now say whether it is true. I shall quote what the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs said. He asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether he had phoned Mr. McHenry of America. His reply was: &#x201C;No&#x2026;"</p>

<p>Where do you read that?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs said that he had given a copy to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition before he left his office. It is Dr. Waldheim&#x2019;s statement. After that, the hon. member called Mr. McHenry the next morning. [Interjections.] The issue was not whether it had been in the morning; it was whether he had indeed called. [Interjections.] The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made a statement on 10 March with regard to this complained of conversation with Mr. McHenry. The report which appeared in <i>Die Burger,</i> states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Leier van die Opposisie ontken ten sterkste dat hy enige vertroue geskend het</block>

<p>Hon. members must listen carefully&#x2014;</p>

<p>But the question was also whether he had called McHenry at all. He did not deny it, nor did he admit it. Do hon. members know when he realized that he had to admit it? It was only when he rose on a point of personal explanation. But as soon as he did so, he immediately landed himself in difficulties in respect of the contents of that conversation. I should like to read to hon. members what he said, because I think it is interesting. The hon. member for Rondebosch should take note of this. The hon. Leader said that he had first had a conversation with an ambassador here, and the ambassador had said something very interesting. I am quoting the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He said&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is aware of all the conversations. He is also aware of the telephone conversation, but he is not aware of its contents. He is subtly dissociating himself from the contents of that telephone call. His whole performance was aimed at doing so.</p>

<p>I now wish to deal with a new aspect, for my time is limited. There were witnesses present during the interview the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout had with the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>The first. There is another aspect of what I call this tragic occurrence, an aspect which, to my mind, now deserves attention. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs did not only provide the hon. members with information in the ordinary way. He gave them certain information, information relating to the person and behaviour of the hon. Leader&#x2019;s confidant and brother, Mr. McHenry. Now, what are the facts? The most important part of the information which was given to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other hon. members on 26 February, was in connection with the anti-South African role Mr. McHenry played in certain suspicious activities which had taken place in New York behind the scenes.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also told the members of the Opposition in question that South Africa had been cheated by the agreement and quoted evidence supporting Mr. McHenry&#x2019;s involvement in the steps taken against South Africa. In spite of the fact that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his people, and others as well, were warned about the dual role of Mr. McHenry with regard to the South West Africa problem, what did the hon. Leader do? In the first place, he held discussions with a contact man. What did he do after that?

<p>Kindly allow me to finish. I now come to the worst of it. The hon. member went back to the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs the next day and kept quiet about the conversation.

<p>Of course he has no integrity whatsoever.</p>

<p>*What is required to have that hon. member severely censured by this House? In the first place, if he has told an untruth, and the untruth he has told here, is proved. In the second place, if he acts other than in the interests of South Africa in respect of information given to him confidentially.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude by asking how we would have known that the hon. member called Mr. McHenry on the 27th, because only he himself, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and Mr. McHenry knew about it unless he himself mentioned it, and, in fact, he told an untruth about it. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout could have done so, but he did not, because he is loyal to leaders&#x2014;or so they say! [Interjections.] The only other person who could have done it, was Mr. McHenry himself, and why would he do that to a bloodbrother unless something happened about which he wanted to establish the facts. I now wish to refer to what Mr. Eksteen told us. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Colin Eglin het hom vanoggend geskakel om met hom oor Suidwes te gesels. Eersgenoemde&#x2026;</block>

<p>That did not appear in Waldheim&#x2019;s statement, did it? The activities of Mr. Ahtisaari and Dr. Waldheim were not reflected in the statement. Where, therefore, did he obtain that information? He obtained it from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>If there still is any notion of the rules of this House and if there still is appreciation for norms and codes of behaviour in accordance with the conventions of this House, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must adopt one of these courses of action. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition stands accused of the allegations against him.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude by referring to the hon. member for Rondebosch. What did he do last night? He stood up and expressed great indignation at people who accused other people on the basis of innuendos. How did he end his speech last night? I wonder whether he himself remembers. He concluded his speech last night by levelling at this House the accusation that if we had to fight, he would remain and we would run. If those are the norms which he endorsed as a pedagogue and an academic, it is as well that our children, and others&#x2019; children as well, no longer attend lectures by him. I should further like to know from the hon. member: What did he give up to come and sit here in the House? Surely his circumstances in this House are better than they were before he came here.</p>

The hon. member for Rondebosch had a golden opportunity to reply to one of the best speeches on statecraft I have heard in this House, viz. the speech of the hon. member for Randburg.

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to dwell for a few moments on the historic telephone conversation between the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and Mr. McHenry. Historic it certainly is because in our democratic form of government the Leader of the Opposition is regarded as the shadow Prime Minister of the country. For the first time in the history of South Africa it will stand recorded in our annals that the Leader of the Opposition liaised with and consulted people who do not mean well with South Africa.</p>

<p>I now want to put a very brief question to those hon. members, but there is a major principle with major implications at stake. Hon. members on that side of the House must tell me who pays for this sort of telephone call which their leader makes? I maintain that there are three possible sources from which payment for this sort of telephone call could be made. In the first place, it could come from the funds of that party. If it comes from the funds of that party, I want to tell them that if their leader phoned New York to talk about cabbages and kings, as he is suggesting, hon. members must remember that a telephone call to New York costs R16,50 for six minutes. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is therefore using the funds of his party in this way. A 12-minute call would cost R31,20. If the party is not paying for it, it is possible&#x2014;Mr. Speaker, you can help me because I do not know; in this connection I am not fully informed&#x2014;that the Leader of the Opposition is entitled to certain telephone privileges from Parliament, from the State. If he is entitled to make such calls at the cost of the State, I think it is very important that the country should know that taxpayers&#x2019; money is being used for that sort of telephone call.</p>

<p>I do not for one moment accept that the discussion had to do with trivialities but in point of fact with the subject of the charge made by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs against the Leader of the Opposition. The third possibility is that the Leader of the Opposition paid for such a telephone call out of his own pocket. If that is the case, I want to tell his followers that the position in which they have placed him entitles him as a member of Parliament and Leader of the Opposition to certain recompense and to use that amount of money, no matter how small, for some malpractice. Up to a few days ago Opposition members were repeatedly asking for an election and I want to ask them now if they are still eager to have an election.</p>

<p>In all humility I want to make a serious appeal this afternoon. In South Africa we have a person who for 20 years occupied the position of Leader of the Opposition in South Africa with honour and distinction. When it came to the interests of South Africa and of the people of South Africa, he did not hesitate in the implementation of his duties as Leader of the Opposition to stand four-square behind the Government I refer to Sir De Villiers Graaff. Should my request reach the ears of Sir De Villiers Graaff, I think it is necessary that because of his mature experience and his years of service to South Africa as Leader of the Opposition he should give a verdict and tell us his views and his opinion on these activities, this conduct of the Leader of the Opposition. It would be interesting to have the opinion of such a person who was for so many years the loyal Leader of the Opposition in regard to the conduct of the present Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>In this debate each speaker from the Opposition side has referred to the unfortunate Information episode which we have experienced in recent months in South Africa. I want to tell the Opposition that the nation, the people of South Africa, are tired of these unfortunate incidents in the Department of Information. I had the <span class="col_4107-4108" refersTo="page_0449"/>privilege of attending a public meeting in Vereeniging last Friday evening together with the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications and the hon. Leader in the Transvaal. I can tell hon. members that the Transvaal leader and the hon. Ministers received sustained enthusiastic applause at that meeting from the audience of 500 people. But the greatest applause came when the hon. leader in the Transvaal told the audience: &#x201C;Ladies and gentlemen, tonight I am not going to talk to you about Information, because I am tired of Information. Information has gone sour.&#x201D; Then those 500 people gave the loudest applause of the evening. This is indicative of the fact that the public at large are sick and tired of this misfortune that has taken place in our national economy. The public generally need to go forward and develop and to do the important work that has to be done and that South Africa is waiting to do.</p>

<p>I do not want to refer to the other side of Information and, unfortunately, it has hardly been investigated at all in recent times. Are hon. members aware that our Public Service framework consists of no less than 43 State departments? A Secretary is in charge of every department. I think it is a unique world record for a government, commercial undertaking or any organization which has been operating or in power for 30 years, to have such a misfortune occur for the first time after 30 years. In our national economy it occurred for the first time after 30 years. Of the 43 secretaries of State departments, one secretary unfortunately went off the rails. I want to issue this challenge this afternoon: Show me any organization or commercial undertaking that has existed for 30 years and that is involved with people and money where no irregularities, malpractices or corruption is to be found. It will not be easy. Corruption took place in only one State department out of 43. I want to facilitate this challenge further and reduce the period of 30 years to 10 years. Show me a business undertaking or organization that has operated for 10 years without malpractices or corruption taking place. It does not happen.</p>

<p>That is why I want to say this afternoon that this unfortunate Information episode has opened the eyes of many of us to something we apparently accepted as self-evident for many years. Because of a good Public Service perhaps we just accepted it and felt it would always be the case. That is why, because of this unfortunate episode, we have taken another look at the Public Service and we realize that for 30 years nothing went wrong in 42 State departments. That is why this afternoon we as a Parliament and the nation of South Africa say to those 42 State departments with their thousands of men and women who daily render loyal service to and labour for South Africa, that we honour and appreciate what they are doing for the RSA. These are people who have no platform on which to climb to tell the country and the world what they do and what they are in a position to do, but what they do they do in the interests of the RSA, in silence and often in modesty behind closed office doors. Those people deserve our sincerest thanks and appreciation.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the budget I want to tell the hon. the Minister of Finance that because of his competence and the vision he possesses and because of the expertise of his department we were given a budget last week which has seldom before been so talked about in South Africa. At the same time we also want to tell the hon. the Minister that we realize that in recent months there have been a number of personal attacks on him. There have also been a number of attacks on the office he holds. Hon. members on this side of the House want to say to him that between 70% and 80% of the public at large have always known that his person, efficiency, honesty and integrity are beyond reproach. He has withstood these attacks and passed the test. When attacks are made upon and lies are told about a person, when gossip is spread about him, as happened in this case, and when that person weathers those attacks convincingly and forcefully, he emerges stronger on the other side. That is why we want to tell the hon. the Minister of Finance today that we are grateful to have him in the service of South Africa and its people. We feel that he will render beneficial service to South Africa for a long time.</p>

<p>It is a good budget. A good budget does not materialize in a day, a month or a year or two, because there is a lot of preparatory and background work to be done in respect of such an outstanding budget. That is why with great piety this afternoon I want to pay tribute to a person who laboured for many years to <span class="col_4109-4110" refersTo="page_0450"/>make this wonderful budget possible. I think of our former State President and Minister of Finance, the late Dr. Diederichs, who for years made it his function to travel throughout the world and talk about gold, to propagate a confidence in gold and to tell the world that the best security measure there was, was to invest in gold. Although he is no longer with us we are still reaping the fruits of his efforts and we pay grateful tribute to his memory.</p>

<p>I think of someone else who for years gave all he had to creating a climate in which a budget like this would be possible. That is our former Prime Minister. Can we forget how in the early sixties, when our country and its people were so often threatened by subversive organizations, he was the man who took them by the throat, throttled them and eliminated them in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>We also think with gratitude today of our present hon. Prime Minister, our hon. Minister of Defence. He it was who for years kept our country&#x2019;s borders safe. Were it not for his competence and determination, this wonderful budget could hardly have been conceived.</p>

<p>I do not think we should dwell constantly on the Opposition and on problems. That is why I want immediately to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister and his department to a practical problem that requires their intelligent and sympathetic consideration. After that I shall deal with the hon. Opposition again. In South Africa we have three levels of government. There are our local, our provincial and our central government levels. The central government level is the one with which John Citizen seldom has any contact. The good citizen has little to do with the police. The healthy citizen seldom comes into contact with a hospital. The law-abiding citizen has nothing to do with a prison. These are all things that are the function of the central government.</p>

<p>Then we come to the provincial level of government. Here we find things like schools with which all parents and children are concerned every day. In the third place we have to do with the local level of government. This includes, <i>inter alia,</i> municipalities and other local authorities which John Citizen lives with from morning to night, and again from night to morning, every day of his life, all day and every day, with the obligations which local government imposes on him. This is unfortunately the case, and for this reason the hon. the Minister and his department will have to very serious consider assisting the ordinary citizenry at this level. When one gets up in the morning and turns on the tap, one gets water for which one has to pay the municipality or the local authority. When a man&#x2019;s wife makes his food, she turns the stove on, and payment has to be made for the electricity that the municipality or local authority provides. When a man gets into his car to drive to work, he uses the roads that have been built by the municipality or the local authority. When he reaches his office and turns on the light or the air-conditioning plant, he uses electricity which is bought from the local authority or the municipality. When he drives home at night and it is dark, he drives through illuminated streets. Those streetlights are provided by the municipality or the local authority. They have to be paid for. If he and his wife go to an entertainment in the town hall at night, they use amenities that have been provided for them by the municipality or local authority. When one goes to the town library, one uses an amenity provided by the local authority or the municipality. When a man takes a bath in the evening and his bathwater drains away, it flows into a sewage system provided by the local authority or the municipality.</p>

<p>What I say now, I say with concern and with emphasis. I could take hon. members to towns in the Transvaal today where there are undeveloped residential lots, lots which the owners are prepared to give away for nothing. They want to get rid of them so that they do not have to pay the obligatory municipal rates. I am not blaming the municipalities or local authorities for this. These are essential services they have to provide, there are costs incurred and their budgets must balance. That is why they are compelled to levy these high rates and tariffs on residents of the town.</p>

<p>That is the problem, but what is the solution? I think the hon. the Minister and his department could perhaps consider a possible solution that I want to suggest. In this connection I want to take myself as an example. I live outside my town and there are also hundreds of farmers and owners of smallholdings in my vicinity. Every day we make use of the facilities our town provides. <span class="col_4111-4112" refersTo="page_0451"/>We drive in its streets, make use of its library, our children use the swimming-bath, we use the town hall, etc. The municipal ratepayers, however, are the only people who are charged and pay for those services that are provided for the whole population. There are thousands of Black people in the vicinity of my town who make use of the facilities of the municipality but pay nothing for them.</p>

<p>I do feel therefore that this commitment should be spread over the whole population. I wonder therefore whether it is possible for the hon. the Minister and his department to consider raising the present general sales tax of 4% to 4&#x00BD;<i>%</i> or 5% so that the funds obtained from this levy in excess of 4% can be allocated to local authorities and city councils to ensure that this expenditure is spread over the whole population. I am sure that no citizen will object to this.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring to the hon. member for Rondebosch. This hon. member is a fine young man&#x2026; [Interjections]&#x2026; for whom I have a great respect. But I want to tell him that he has unfortunately strayed. I want therefore to give him and the leader of his party a little fatherly advice. They must always remember that there are certain laws in life which they cannot evade, and one of the inexorable laws of life relates to hate. I know how they are filled with hatred for Dr. Connie Mulder and the present State President. But I want to tell them that hatred consumes, that hatred is self-consuming. They can see what is taking place within the ranks of their own party. They are in the process of destroying themselves as a result of their hatred for other people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch said yesterday that we would not fight for South Africa. If he wants to fight for South Africa he is sitting in the wrong place. He must come and sit on this side of the House. The hon. the Prime Minister and the NP and the people who support it love South Africa. We know South Africa. We know South Africa from the Cape of Storms in the south to the Limpopo, our northern border. We know the Boland with its vineyards; Namaqualand, the Karoo, the Free State with its bushveld and its merino sheep. We know the Free State and Transvaal with its mealies and sunflower fields, the Witwatersrand with its industries where the wheels and cogs turn each day to make South Africa economically strong. This is the country we have helped to build and which we love. Further, in the north, we know the wag-&#x2019;n-bietjie of the Bushveld and the soetdoringboom where the red Afrikaner cattle with their spreading horns graze. Still further we know the gigantic baobab and the country right up to the banks of the Limpopo. This is the land we love. This is the land we shall not only defend; it is also the land we shall keep, not just for ourselves but for generations to come.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Meyerton will forgive me for not commenting on the major part of his speech as my time is limited and I want to deal with other matters.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, who is unfortunately not now in the House, followed the pattern of previous speakers in the Government benches in the debate of the last few days, and in fact added very little to the debate. I believe that if this debate has shown nothing else, it has shown us the Government&#x2019;s total desperation about the Information scandal and its desire to get away from the scandal at all costs, as has been indicated by the hon. member for Meyerton and other hon. members. The Eglin-McHenry issue which has been debated here for the last few days is nothing more than a reckless and patent attempt by the Government to throw a smokescreen over the Government&#x2019;s own culpability in respect of the Information affair, and to create a diversion.</p>

<p>In the sense that the Government has found it necessary to resort to the desperate tactics, they have given some testimony of the effectiveness of the attacks which have come from this side of the House in regard to the whole Information affair. On Tuesday afternoon, after an incisive and telling speech by the hon. Leader of the Opposition, which highlighted a number of questions in regard to the Information affair on which the public of South Africa still require answers, the Government suddenly decided that they had had enough of the Information affair and then resorted to their <span class="col_4113-4114" refersTo="page_0452"/>diversionary tactics, and on that Tuesday afternoon the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs burst into this Chamber after being briefed to throw a smokescreen. That is precisely what he did. For half an hour on Tuesday afternoon we were treated to a sickening display of histrionics by the hon. the Minister. He made a number of totally unsubstantiated attacks on and allegations about the integrity and loyalty of the hon. Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Sir, I withdraw the word &#x201C;cowardly&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs made a hit-and-run attack on the hon. Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>What, in fact, is the allegation and the accusation against the hon. Leader of the Opposition? The allegation is that the hon. Leader of the Opposition had disclosed confidential information in a telephone conversation to an enemy of South Africa. That is the gravamen of the whole attack. Sir, it is strange that this sort of allegation should be made six weeks after the event, after the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs first learned of the telephone conversation. It is also strange that only 10 days ago the same hon. Minister said in this House that he was prepared to brief the Opposition on secret projects. At that stage he had no problems with the loyalty and trustworthiness of the Opposition in the interests of South Africa. For that full period he said nothing, but suddenly in this debate, because of the trouble the Government found itself in, he deemed it necessary to put up this smokescreen.</p>

<p>What are the facts of the situation? We are talking about a telephone conversation. There can or ought only to be two parties engaged in a telephone conversation. In this case it was the hon. Leader of the Opposition and Ambassador Mr. McHenry who took part in the conversation. Both these gentlemen have emphatically denied the accuracy of the allegation made by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and that any confidential information was disclosed. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs brought no evidence whatsoever in support of the allegations he made. In today&#x2019;s <i>Argus</i> one gets the response by Ambassador McHenry. <i>The Argus,</i> quoting him from New York, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">United States&#x2019; diplomat Mr. Don McHenry has defended &#x201C;totally innocent&#x201D; contact with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Colin Eglin.

<p>I was dealing with the numerous accusations and statements during this debate referring to the United States of America as the enemy of South Africa. One wonders if this is the brand of diplomacy followed by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and his followers, and one wonders: Where are our friends? Who are our friends? They say that to talk to the United States of America means that one is talking to an enemy of South Africa. What is the implication of this as far as Government policy is concerned? [Interjections.] I believe, as I have said, that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs owes this House an apology for coming here and making circumstantial allegations against the integrity of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with another matter in relation to the Erasmus Commission. It is a matter which has been referred to by the hon. member for Parktown and by the hon. member for Durban North previously in this debate, but I make no apologies for coming back to it because we have had no response from Government members whatsoever. It is a matter of very great seriousness in relation to the veracity of those people concerned. I want to quote from page 16 of the interim report of the Erasmus Commission where it deals with the question of the transfer of $10 million to Switzerland. The report simply states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">General Pienaar, the then Comptroller, SADF, testified that during September 1974 at the Second Session of Parliament he sat next to Admiral H. H. Biermann, the then Chief of the Defence Force, in the officials&#x2019; bay of the Parliament Building. Mr. P. W. Botha entered and spoke to Admiral Biermann. The latter then leant over towards him and said that he had to go to the Secretary for Finance, Mr. G. Browne, to arrange for certain funds to be transferred to Switzerland that same afternoon. According to the witness, Mr. Browne knew precisely that $10 million had to be so transferred and he authorized it.</block>

<p><span class="col_4117-4118" refersTo="page_0454"/>The report then goes on to refer to comments made by Mr. Browne and comments by Gen. Pienaar about these moneys having been made available from the special defence fund, i.e. the amount of $10 million that had to be transferred to a Swiss bank. In the short session of Parliament, during a speech made by the hon. member for Durban North&#x2014;and I quote from Hansard of Friday, 8 December, col. 420&#x2014;the hon. member said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I would like the hon. the Prime Minister to help me with a particular problem which we have. That is to find out whether there is any truth in the rumour that Gen. Pienaar, now retired, was controller of the Defence Force and that he, on the instruction of Adm. Biermann, channelled R10 million&#x2026;</block>

<p>The only discrepancy is that the amount is referred to as R10 million instead of $10 million&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; through the Special Defence Account to Switzerland. This was in approximately 1974.</block>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister: That is an outright lie!</block>

<p>The Prime Minister does not say it is just a lie; he says it is an outright lie. Those are very strong words indeed! The hon. member for Durban North went on speaking, and shortly after that the Prime Minister interjected again as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Will the hon. member be prepared to testify about that before the Erasmus Commission?</block>

<p>A few lines further, when the hon. member persisted, there was another interjection by the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is gossip, and you know that!</block>

<p>A little further there is another interjection by the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a serious insinuation.</block>

<p>A short while later a further interjection by the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is cowardly gossip.</block>

<p>I therefore want to ask in all seriousness&#x2014;and I am sorry the hon. the Prime Minister is not in the House now&#x2014;what the situation is. Who is telling the truth? Are the witnesses who gave evidence before the Erasmus Commission telling the truth or was the hon. the Prime Minister, in his absolute denial, telling the truth? They could not all have been telling the truth! [Interjections.] This is a very serious matter indeed.</p>

<p>Someone in the Government benches must clear this matter up. The hon. the Prime Minister makes emphatic interjections, yet when the commission reports, it is found that senior officials confirm precisely what the hon. member for Durban North was saying and what the hon. the Prime Minister repeatedly denied in absolute terms. The country is entitled to know who is telling the truth in this case. An amount of $10 million is transferred from South Africa to Switzerland and there is this disparity between the evidence of the hon. the Prime Minister of South Africa on the one hand and senior officials who gave evidence before the Erasmus Commission on the other hand.</p>

<speech by="#swart">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. A. F. SWART</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, now we are talking about integrity! I hope the hon. the Minister of Finance will try to reply to this, but I am sorry that the hon. the Prime Minister is not in the House in order to deal with the situation, because it is a very serious situation involving a reflection on the veracity of either the hon. the Prime Minister or the senior officials who gave evidence to the Erasmus Commission. Now there is a stony silence from the Government benches. [Interjections.] I ask that this matter be given specific attention, attention which is certainly needs to be given.</p>

<p>There is much more one would like to say about the whole operation of the Erasmus Commission, and there will be many other opportunities for doing so. At this stage, however, I should like to stand back briefly and examine the attitude of mind of Government <span class="col_4119-4120" refersTo="page_0455"/>members who allowed it to happen, and I should like to examine this in relation to the real needs of South Africa. I believe that it gives one a frightening insight into the totally unrealistic view the Government of the day has of the real interests of South Africa. If one looks back to the time when these operations took place, one sees a Government, in the mid-&#x2019;seventies, beleaguered and drifting as it was in a hostile world, being totally obsessed with what it believed was a need to defend its race policies. I say not to review them, change them or rethink them, but to defend them. They were obsessed by what they term&#x2014;and what they then termed&#x2014;the total onslaught on South Africa. This is an argument that is still being used at the present time to mitigate, if not to justify, what happened in the Department of Information. Surely if one is faced with a total onslaught, it is not simply sufficient to embark upon a wild and devious counter-attack. Surely, if one is faced a total onslaught, one should look to one&#x2019;s own defences to see in what areas those defences are, in fact, defensible. This was, however, not the attitude of the Government. Their attitude was to embark on the wild escapades of the former Department of Information, and I believe it was totally against the true interests of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAN S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hardly anything worthwhile and excellent is ever achieved without some idiots taking pot-shots at it, its creators and its architects.</p>

<p>Their common mistake is usually that they only look at the individual components in isolation and not at the harmonious &#x201C;whole&#x201D;, the synthesis, that only a real master can achieve.</p>

<p>My remarks today will be aimed at avoiding mediocrity in our nation, aspiring towards meritocracy and gaining an edge of brilliance over other leading nations; an effort to stop the wastage of time, energy and money.</p>

<p>My views in regard to the former Department of Information remain exactly the same as they were during the no-confidence debate, when I put them forward in some detail.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance and his relevant departments have a proud record of handling the financial affairs of South Africa. In my humble opinion the present budget is a further milestone and a further triumph for them. There have been signs of relief in important circles at the fact that the reference to the capital gains tax and the reference to the clamp-down on perks are, at this stage, only references. Whatever the merits or the demerits might be, an amazing sensitivity about these matters exists in important circles, amongst entrepreneurs, investors, capitalists and risk-takers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malcomess">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. N. MALCOMESS</person>:</from>

<p>What is your point of view?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAN S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>In the South African context of today we need the energies, the capabilities, the capital, the risk-taking and the entrepreneurship of this kind of a person to help lead and maintain the growth rate we need for full employment. What I am suggesting is that in our consideration of these matters, we should take the alternatives available to them into account, i.e. other investment areas that might be available to these people, just to make sure that we shall continue to compare favourably in this respect.</p>

<p>I also believe that the hon. the Minister will continue to give sympathetic consideration to salaries in the Public Service, e.g. Police, teaching profession and other similar spheres. In this regard I also specifically want to mention the broad spectrum of pensioners and especially those living off incomes from fixed investments which they made at a time when money was still worth a great deal more than it is today.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has moved a long way towards more fair taxation for married women. I still believe, however, that we should continue our efforts to abandon discrimination, not only that based on colour, but also that based on sex, age, etc.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the matter of travel allowances for South Africans. Taking the realities of today&#x2019;s world into account, these travel allowances do seem to be inadequate.</p>

<p>I do not wish to continue emphasizing the obvious or repeating what others have already said, but I wish to start off by making three specific recommendations.</p>

<p>In the first place I recommend a National Efficiency and Productivity Council, comprising of practical experts, that should survey and monitor the entire spectrum of our <span class="col_4121-4122" refersTo="page_0456"/>national life and make recommendations. This should be an umbrella body and not a substitute for existing productivity organizations. It should be a body that will amplify and supplement the work of these other organizations.</p>

<p>This would include very sincere and all-out efforts by both the public and private sectors to bring all their activities as far as humanly possible on to a daily, up-to-date basis. This would not only save millions, but it would also be directly in line with the ideal of the hon. the Prime Minister as regards a clean administration. Let us also make it an efficient and up-to-date administration. Modern computer methods make it possible today, with a little added hard work, to achieve this magnificent ideal.</p>

<p>Secondly, I recommend a weekly news survey through SABC/TV under the guidance of a panel of experts. Perhaps all political parties should be represented on that panel? That survey should point specifically to incorrect reporting and specifically mention the names of the relevant media. This would be appreciated by the general public and it would be a most valuable national educational service. The freedom of the Press would remain untouched, but then they would publicly and openly have to compete for a good reputation and an image of the highest standards in journalistic achievement.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I recommend an annual award-giving event to give recognition to accuracy, honesty, the projection of the right perspective and a balanced viewpoint in media reporting.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. B. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>One could call it <i>The Citizen</i> award.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAN S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Any other specific worthwhile achievements in other fields, such as may be proposed by the National Efficiency and Productivity Council, could also be given recognition to on the same occasion. For example, we already have a Top Businessman Award every year. We can also have an Outstanding Industrial Efficiency Award. This important body would serve both the public and the private sectors. I believe that in this South Africa can set an example to practically the rest of the world and make a name for itself for efficiency and up-to-dateness. It will help us to attract investors and investments, business relationships, trade and many other worthwhile benefits.</p>

<p>Let me explain myself and motivate my recommendations in a little more detail. Inflation is a fatal cancerous destroyer of assets and wealth around the world. Why is this so? It is because of the fact that politicians and other leaders, including dictators, clamour for popularity with the masses. It is also due to the gullibility of the masses, so many people who think they can continue everlastingly to render less and less work for more and more pay, maintaining or even improving their living standards. These leaders have also abandoned the necessary monetary and financial disciplines in their countries in an effort to postpone the evil day or to leave it to their successors to cope with. South Africans cannot entirely be the exception because, as a great trading nation, we import about 50% of our inflation. We can nevertheless do important things to improve the position.</p>

<p>Firstly, ingenuity, creativity and technological advances could at a certain time, and still can at times, to some extent make up for inflation. In this regard I would therefore recommend a system of rewards for achievements in this field. Even though some people may scoff at it, I welcome such gestures as that of Mr. Theo Rutstein of Teljoy who has offered one million rand to anyone coming forward with a replacement for petrol.</p>

<p>Secondly, even with our large labour force and taking into account the fact that we have to have incentives to make use of labour rather than expensive and mainly imported capital assets, I still feel we should not neglect efforts at simplification, rationalization, amalgamation and the elimination of duplication and other wasteful practices; also even in what some might consider small matters. Let us take a practical example. One has one&#x2019;s home carpeted, wall to wall with carpeting of a certain pattern and is assured a number of times that should a small piece be damaged or wear out, it would be easy to replace it with the same pattern. However, that is about the last one hears of it. The same applies over a wide spectrum of similar articles, for example cutlery, crockery, etc.</p>

<p>There are pharmacists who are complaining&#x2014;and I think that they are making out quite a good case&#x2014;that they <span class="col_4123-4124" refersTo="page_0457"/>have to sell quantities of tablets and other medicines in excess of what the patient needs and can afford.</p>

<p>Maybe such an efficiency body could have a closer look at all these issues and recommend certain changes or new methods.</p>

<p>It is furthermore a scientific fact that the more bookkeeping, accounting, internal auditing, external official auditing, administration and correspondence, are not up to date, the more the work load is multiplied and the more effort, energy and expense are required to do the same job. It is a cumulative process and means that tremendous wastage takes place.</p>

<p>However, most important of all is the fact that this creates the most fertile possible soil for fraud, theft and wrong decisions based on false premises of out of date or incomplete statistical figures and particulars. The statistics in certain sectors in our country are sadly out of date.</p>

<p>I want to say that over a period this type of inefficiency could cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of rand, maybe even billions.</p>

<p>Let us take our law courts as another practical example. How long does it take to bring up an important case for a hearing? It takes months, maybe years. In the meantime witnesses die or skip the country, or their memories begin to fail, and ultimately decisions have to be made on incomplete or vague evidence leading to wrong and unfair decisions.</p>

<p>Fourthly, let us take the time consumed every day by the public, by what should be a no-nonsense, hard-working nation in South Africa, in reading incorrect reports in the media, only to find the next day that what they had read the day before is nonsense and completely devoid of all truth. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us take the example of Dr. Rhoodie in Sao Paulo, that &#x201C;never was&#x201D;; or take the Katie Rhoodie affair, the story about the documents at the embassy in Paris, that seems to have been a grotesque distortion. Admittedly there are the gullible ones among the general public who like to do their &#x201C;fiction reading&#x201D; in the media every day. However, do we really want to cater for that? Do the various media not really want to cater for the busy, productive worker who wants the truth spelt out to him in the briefest possible manner? Is it not appalling, when a top South African like Dr. Danie Craven returns from overseas, that the first thing he says on television on arriving in South Africa is something more or less as follows: &#x201C;You should not really believe what you read in the papers?&#x201D; Do we not hear this kind of remark too frequently these days?</p>

<p>I believe we have already too many control boards and interference with basic personal and business freedoms. I should like us to move away from controls and penalties and move towards incentives, awards and the education of the public so that members of the public can be the true judges and demand what is right, truthful and honest. I therefore recommend a National Efficiency and Productivity Council of practical experts, an umbrella body to survey and monitor the entire spectrum of our national life also incorporating the existing productivity organizations.</p>

<p>This would include a genuine all-out effort to bring everything in both our private business sector and in our public sector as near as humanly possible to a daily up-to-date basis. We could not only save hundreds of millions, but this will be directly in line with the ideal of the hon. the Prime Minister of giving us a clean administration. Let us then also have an efficient and up-to-date administration, an administration which will elevate us above the common crowd and which will bring us investors, investments, business friends and trade will prevent theft, fraud and wrong decisions; and many, many other benefits.</p>

<p>In the second instance, I recommend a weekly news survey by SABC TV under the guidance of a panel of experts. All political parties may be represented. Specific examples should be mentioned of incorrect reporting, and the names of the media involved should be made known. The public would appreciate this service and it will be a tremendous educational experience for the whole nation. The freedom of the Press will not be touched. However, the media will now have to compete openly for excellence and brilliance, and morality, if they so wish, in journalism, the ideal towards which we should strive.</p>

<p>In the third instance I recommend an annual award-winning event recognizing accuracy, honesty, the projecting of the right perspective and of a balanced viewpoint in all media reporting, and also recognizing any other specific worthwhile achievement in <span class="col_4125-4126" refersTo="page_0458"/>other fields, such as the National Efficiency and Productivity Council may recommend from time to time. We already have the newspapers themselves running a top businessmen award project. They have been doing so for years, and with good effect. In this instance we could have for example an &#x201C;outstanding industrial efficiency&#x201D; award. It can only have a great uplifting effect.</p>

<p>This important body should, as I have already said, serve both the public and the private sector.</p>

<p>I believe that such an approach would make South Africa stand out among nations. It would make us the envy of many nations. We will be known as a country of efficient, honest, clean administration, a country where people invest and where they receive their answers immediately, a country where people know where they stand, a country where one has modern, up-to-date information. Then, and only then, would it be unnecessary to have endless debates and wastage of money on vagaries of the past.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the strategy of the hon. Opposition in this debate is quite clear. Up to now it has been quite clear to us that they have decided to have a lot to say about information, a little about finance and nothing about their policy. I believe the Opposition owes it to this House&#x2014;to the voters of South Africa, too, of course&#x2014;to take their constitutional framework out of the cupboard and to dust it off a little so that we can see what that skeleton looks like.</p>

<p>I spent some time examining their constitutional proposals. I can describe them in one sentence only: They are a blueprint for political and economic chaos.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. T. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bryanston should not be so hasty. I first want to set out the charge-sheet. Later I shall prove my case. In these constitutional proposals of theirs they make certain claims, which simply cannot be realized in practice. In these proposals they are trying to provide certain guarantees which cannot, of course, be fulfilled. Last but not least, they are trying to reconcile certain political ideologies and theories with one another, which are completely irreconcilable. There are three cracks in their constitutional framework. I shall now tell hon. members what they are.</p>

<p>In the first place these constitutional proposals are going to fail because of a national convention, in the second place because consensus is being mooted, and in the third place because of proportionality. When this constitutional phase is examined, there are two basic facts which everyone should take cognizance of if he dares to draw up a constitutional framework. Cognizance has to be taken of the realities of South Africa and of the political climate in Southern Africa. When I say that cognizance should be taken of the realities in South Africa, then it is a fact&#x2014;and there is no escaping it&#x2014;that an ethnic plurality, race differences and civilization differences, which are all divisive factors, have to be taken into account.</p>

<p>I concede that there are also binding factors, but for any policy to be able to succeed, the divisive factors which I have mentioned, have to be reflected in some constitutional policy or other. I do not want to go into this matter any further because I think that we do not differ much on this matter. However, it is very important that cognizance should be taken of the prevailing political school of thought in Southern Africa, because it also influences constitutional thinking in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to refer to a specific facet of the political school of thought, viz. the revolutionary school of thought which exists in South Africa and Southern Africa. It is a fact which we cannot reason away, because it is as plain as a pikestaff that a school of thought advocating political revolution exists in South Africa and Southern Africa, as we have seen in the Shaba Province and Angola and now in Rhodesia. In this regard I want to tell hon. members of the official Opposition that as soon as they open the doors of their national convention to this school of thought&#x2014;if it has not already sneaked in through the back door&#x2014;it will cloud the atmosphere of the national convention. The forces which are unleashed in this national convention could only be controlled if the existing structure is replaced by a minority domination&#x2014;I do not even want to say by a democracy. Only then will the political climate which sneaked in through the back door of the national convention, be <span class="col_4127-4128" refersTo="page_0459"/>assuaged. I want to mention a few examples to hon. members of this political school of thought of revolution. I am doing so only for the sake of the record, because I know it is general knowledge. Nevertheless I think we should take cognizance of it. As reported in the magazine <i>Africa</i> of October 1978, the following question was put to Robert Mugabe, co-leader of the Patriotic Front&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where do you see the conclusion of the current war in Zimbabwe; on the battlefield or negotiation table?</block>

<p>His reply to this was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that genuine independence can only come out of the barrel of a gun, that is on the battlefield.</block>

<p>So I can quote to hon. members other examples and statements by Robert Mugabe and many other militant Black leaders. I am mentioning this matter because I regard it as so important in the constitutional phase which we are entering, and because I do not see this element of an awareness of the revolutionary political school of thought in South Africa reflected in the constitutional proposals of the official Opposition.</p>

<p>I shall give the hon. member for Rondebosch an indication when he may put a question to me.</p>

<p>I made the statement that the constitutional proposals contain certain claims which cannot be met in practice. In the first place it is claimed that it affords everyone the opportunity of participating in the process of political change and political decision-making without one group being dominated by another. I am not very concerned about these claims, for it is one thing to make certain claims and another to realize them in practice, but what I am concerned about, are the guarantees which will be given to South African voters in terms of the PFP&#x2019;s constitutional proposals. Basically they give two guarantees, viz. that there will not be domination and that there will not be discrimination. In their proposals it is clearly set out that they advocate an open community without forced separation or forced integration, but in the same breath they also claim that every cultural identity has the right to maintain and preserve its distinctiveness. This is a cardinal aspect which we have to debate. They must tell us how they are going to maintain and preserve the identity of groups in an open community without enforced separation and &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. T. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I take no notice of the hon. member for Bryanston at all.</p>

<p>I want to point out an example. A just claim could, for example, be made by a group in order to preserve its identity. In terms of the PFP&#x2019;s guarantee it can then insist on separate schools. I think this is a just claim it could make in order to preserve its identity. It then approaches the authorities and there it is informed that the authorities grant them the schools in terms of the given guarantee and the policy. However, it is true that one can only keep schools apart if one makes provision for this by statute. I now want to say that if one makes provision for anything like this by statute, one is applying separating measures. If separating measures exist, what becomes of the idea of an open community? This is the reality as we have experienced it and this is the foundation on which we are going to build an orderly government and an orderly community. This is the fundamental point on which the PFP&#x2019;s policy is going to fail.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the question of domination and the PFP&#x2019;s policy of proportionality. With regard to proportionality and domination, the PFP adopts the standpoint that all groups in South Africa are minority groups and that no group will dominate another. Let us look at how this will work in practice. We have to make three fundamental suppositions. I hope that hon. members will concede these. In the first place <span class="col_4129-4130" refersTo="page_0460"/>we have to accept that the political division between Whites will be approximately 60:40, as it is at present. We also have to accept that there will be approximately&#x2014;this is according to the calculations of Prof. Sadie&#x2014;14 million registered voters of all population groups and races. Furthermore we also have to accept that this pattern of free association which, as foreseen by the PFP, will be an integral part of consociational democracy, will not have worked all the way through to such an extent that Black voters will be overanxious to vote for Whites at the time of the first election.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, it is a realistic assumption that we have to accept that there will still be racial and ethnic separation at the first election.</p>

<p>Let us consider what the federal Parliament of plus minus 100 seats will look like on this basis. In the federal Parliament of 100 seats there will be three Indian representatives, nine Coloured representatives, 18 White representatives and 70 Black representatives. In addition the 18 White representatives have to be divided on the basis of 60:40, so that there will be 11 representatives who support the Government and seven who support the Opposition. This is as a result of proportionality. What does the minority veto look like then? Then it cannot be used by Indians, by Coloureds or White voters who support the NP. The official Opposition&#x2019;s guarantee that they can guarantee the identity of minority groups and their right to self-determination by the minority veto, is not worth the paper it is written on.</p>

<p>If we go on to apply this question of proportionality to the Cabinet, then we accept that the Prime Minister will be a Black Prime Minister. The minority veto applies neither to the election of a Prime Minister nor to financial legislation. A Cabinet of 20 members will be constituted as follows in terms of the proportional representation of the federal Parliament. There will be no Indians, there will be two Coloureds, there will be three Whites&#x2014;two representing the Government and one of the Opposition&#x2014;and there will be 14 Black Ministers. In this august body the Indians possess no minority veto, because they are not there. The Coloureds have no minority veto and the Whites who support the NP, also have no minority veto in this federal Cabinet. Therefore, the guarantee that one group will not dominate another group, is a myth, a figment of the imagination, an illusion. The hon. member for Rondebosch may now put his question.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to put a question to the hon. member with regard to this revolutionary climate. It is true that it could create problems for a convention, but I should like to know from the hon. member how the draft proposals of the Government and their homelands policy are going to avoid the revolutionary climate. This is not obvious to me. The second question I want to ask the hon. member, is: When it comes to the Whites why does he consistently draw a distinction between the supporters of the Opposition and the Government, but not between the Blacks?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. T. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>As far as the first question is concerned, I say that the Government&#x2019;s proposals will succeed because they have a bearing on the reality of South Africa. It is, of course, a diversity of peoples, a permanent structure which will be built on and not a coincidental associational pattern as is envisaged by the PFP&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>I conclude, and I want to reiterate that the constitutional proposals of the Opposition can realize no claim on or guarantee of the identity and the preservation of the various population groups. It cannot make provision for every population group&#x2019;s justifiable aspirations for political self-determination. I want to repeat that if we are in earnest about the preservation of identity and political self-determination, there are only one of two choices: Either you have a unitary State based on an integrated social structure, or you have separate political self-determination based on separate social structures.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sorely tempted to react to the argument put forward by the hon. member for Bellville, but unfortunately my time is very limited. However, there is sure to be another opportunity for that. It was significant that the hon. member referred to the strategy of the official Opposition. But he did not say a word about the blatant strategy of the Government in this debate. However, I shall have more to say about that later.</p>

<p><span class="col_4131-4132" refersTo="page_0461"/>&#x2020;As the last speaker from this party in the budget debate I must spend a few moments on the budget itself. I think that most of the things which should be said have already been said in this, the final round&#x2014;there was previously the Post Office budget and the Railways budget&#x2014;of the &#x2019;Mbongo competition, the praise-singing competition. When it comes to praising the Government, however, I am afraid I do not even rank in the fifth or sixth league. I cannot compete with the efforts we have had here. The weak&#x2014;the bad&#x2014;aspects of the budget have, of course, also been dealt with, but as the last speaker in this party it is necessary for me to put our view of the budget on record, and I therefore move as a further amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill unless and until the Government, <i>inter alia</i>, takes adequate and effective steps&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) to reduce input costs of farmers and recreate profit margins for farm products;</li>

<li>(2) to ensure that all secret funds are audited to the satisfaction of the Select Committee on Public Accounts or a subcommittee of that Select Committee;</li>

<li>(3) to ensure that pensions paid to South Africa&#x2019;s senior citizens relate more closely to their actual needs in a society subject to continuing inflation;</li>

<li>(4) to end the Information scandal, which is paralysing Government initiatives in South Africa; and</li>

<li>(5) to instill confidence in the political and economic future of the Republic which will ensure investment to eliminate unemployment and instability&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>All the legs of the amendment have been dealt with by one or more of the speakers in this party. I myself only want to refer briefly to two of the relevant issues.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. the Minister of Agriculture is present because I want to refer, firstly, to the crisis in agriculture. I had the privilege during the recess of covering a vast area of South Africa and of talking and listening to hundreds and hundreds of farmers. As a result of this, it is clear to me that this is an issue that goes beyond politics. It is an issue that far transcends politics. It is not just a question of a drought either. It is a question of the survival of a vital element in South Africa&#x2019;s population structure.</p>

<p>The time has come for us to break the vicious circle of debt and more debt. That is what is happening. The Government is simply helping farmers to get deeper into debt. I said as a joke that I would organize a &#x201C;trekkeroptog&#x201D; of farmers, and I can promise hon. members that it would be the biggest &#x201C;optog&#x201D; to Parliament they have ever seen. Unfortunately, however, the farmers would not be able to afford it. They would not be able to afford the fuel under the present cost structure. What I am saying now is a cry from the heart of the farmers throughout South Africa. With very rare exceptions, it is a cry from every type of farmer. This Government must put an end to the situation.</p>

<p>I believe that agriculture is the greatest armaments factory in South Africa&#x2019;s armoury. If it was our object to spend special defence funds, I believe we could have spent them to better advantage in building up our agricultural industry as the one weapon we could use with the greatest possible effect in the struggle for a stable Southern Africa.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>So I hope the hon. the Minister will now make an application for money from the secret funds with the plea: Let us build South Africa&#x2019;s strongest weapons factory to manufacture the strongest possible weapon&#x2014;food&#x2014;in a subcontinent starved of food.</p>

<p>The other aspect I want to refer to very briefly is that of pensioners. I do not wish to deal with the detailed question of the means test and inflation but rather with the moral aspect of this issue&#x2014;the debt of a nation towards its senior citizens. This cannot be counted in rands and cents or by how many more per cent pensions have gone up in this or in that period. We are not concerned merely with the survival of our old people; we are concerned that they should be enabled <span class="col_4133-4134" refersTo="page_0462"/>to lead a full life and to enjoy their failing years. I believe South Africa has to adjust to a new situation. The old home structure where, as the children moved out to set up their own homes, there was space for the parents to move in has given way to flatlands, smaller homes, and a different sort of life where families are no longer looking after their own parents. I think we have to investigate the situation very carefully.</p>

<p>Lastly on the budget, I want to dispel the idea that this is a give-away budget I do not wish to quote all the statistics now. The hon. the Minister emphasized that there was a 30% tax reduction for this and for that group, but what he did not emphasize was that on the income itself it was a matter of a mere 3%, and not 30%. When one takes the inflation rate into account, it merely means that instead of being 13% or 14% worse off at the end of the year, one is only going to be 10% or 11% worse off. The Minister&#x2019;s &#x201C;planned&#x201D; achievement is nothing else than the correct use of the gold bonanza. He has thrown the ball back to the private sector where it always belonged to see whether they can get him out of the difficulties that Government policy has caused. However, this will all be in vain, unless we restore confidence in South Africa. That brings me to the other issues that have dominated this debate and which, to my mind, are important if we are going to be able to restore confidence.</p>

<p>The first of those is the speech made by the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs. In passing I want to warn him, the Government&#x2014;this also applies to the strategy which the hon. member for Bellville referred to&#x2014;that this issue is not going to let the Government off the hook. It is not going to free them of their own troubles, and it is not going to absolve them from blame over their own failures. It might be a temporary lightning conductor to distract attention, but it does not remove the real issue. It is, however, a matter of importance in regard to which this party cannot stand aside or evade its responsibility.</p>

<p>I have said before that parliamentary government in South Africa is under assault This system of government requires a Government which enjoys the confidence of the people&#x2014;I shall deal with that later&#x2014;and, as a second element, a loyal Opposition, an alternative to which the people can turn if they wish to reject the Government in power. Against this I have had to weigh up and evaluate the charges and the denials that we have heard following the speech of the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs. Whether it is a smokescreen, or whatever else, there is a specific issue at stake, an issue which strikes at the structure of government in South Africa, i.e. the balance between a Government and a loyal Opposition in whom the public can have confidence. I have looked at both and I have listened to the denials.</p>

<p>Let me deal first with the denial by Mr. McHenry. This morning&#x2019;s paper reports him as denying only that he had complained and denying nothing else at all. This afternoon he has denied that he received confidential information, but then he qualified that. It is reported in the Press as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dismissing Mr. Botha&#x2019;s attack on Mr. Eglin for alleged breach of confidence, Mr. McHenry said: &#x201C;I doubt very seriously whether the South African Government has any information which Mr. Eglin was able to pass on to me which would be new to me.&#x201D;</block>

<p>He does not deny that any information was passed on: He denies that it was new. I therefore had a look at the original report from which this whole issue arose. I make no secret of the fact that, after the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke, I approached him and asked to see the telegram or telex from which he had quoted. He showed me the courtesy of allowing me to read the actual wording of it, and it accords with what stands in Hansard. What concerns me is the following sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mnr. Eglin het navraag oor ons Minister se verwysing na di&#x00E9; dinge wat met mnr. Ahtisaari en dr. Waldheim in New York plaasvind, gedoen.</block>

<p>I am not interested in grammar or in splitting hairs: I am interested <span class="col_4135-4136" refersTo="page_0463"/>in facts. The fact is that five members were briefed by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and that one of the issues on which we were briefed was the activities of Mr. Ahtisaari and Dr. Waldheim in New York in regard to a certain matter. I know of no other way in which that could have come out neither from the Waldheim report&#x2014;which I have here&#x2014;nor from any Press report. I do not believe that the Government would ever have disclosed publicly what it disclosed to us. When I read that the call concerned this specific issue&#x2014;a matter of the most delicate nature for us at a time when South Africa was negotiating over a settlement in South West Africa that could be peaceful or violent, something on which lives could depend, it worried me tremendously. This afternoon the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs reminded me of the specific details&#x2014;I can say quite frankly that I had forgotten that aspect&#x2014;of the briefing in regard to Mr. McHenry. I must say that it accords with my own recollection of what happened. I also checked it with my colleague who was present.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I have a very good memory. I remember that he quoted from three different documents. I cannot remember the words he quoted, but he quoted from three documents and they dealt specifically with ambassador McHenry.</p>

<p>This is to me the issue that is before us. The issue is not whether there was a telephone call. I have said in the House and also told the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs that we ourselves met one of the ambassadors and put forward South Africa&#x2019;s case, South Africa&#x2019;s attitude. The NP, too, met one of the ambassadors. There is nothing wrong in that. What concerns me is the question of a confidential briefing and what one does about what one is told. I did not even brief my caucus on it. I did not tell them one word about it.</p>

<p>I have weighed up the position. I have read yesterday&#x2019;s Hansard recording the charges and denials. It was not possible for me to be present yesterday. The denials are a flat contradiction. However this is a specific issue and not one single member of the official Opposition has denied it.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It has been quoted twice. Not one of them has denied that the discussion concerned things which Mr. Ahtisaari and Dr. Waldheim had done in New York. The telegram was quoted on Tuesday and it was quoted again by the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications&#x2014;I have his Hansard here. In fact it has been quoted three times by three hon. Ministers. That it has not been denied is, to me sufficient evidence that there was such a discussion and on that basis I had to consider the situation and stand of the NRP in regard to this matter. I cannot remain neutral.</p>

<p>I want to set this into its proper background. I said that one had to have an alternative Government, an Opposition which was acceptable to the people. Because of its policies, I have never regarded the PFP as being an acceptable political alternative. That is why I have consistently rejected any form of common front, merger or political alliance. I was prepared, however&#x2014;with &#x201C;lang tande&#x201D;&#x2014;to discuss on an <i>ad hoc</i>-basis and on merit the avoidance of senseless three-cornered contests in certain seats. However, I was not prepared to enter into an election pact or agreement. What has now been revealed has confirmed the correctness of my instincts in this regard. I now believe that the PFP has excluded itself from my concept of the definition of a loyal Opposition. [Interjections.] I want to say clearly that my duty is &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, rather than have my limited time wasted I will withdraw the expression if that will settle the issue. It excludes the PFP from my concept of what an Opposition should be. My duty is, to say clearly and without hesitation that on the basis of the evidence as I have seen it, I disassociate the NRP entirely and without qualification from the PFP and will have no further political dealings of any kind with them. [Interjections.] To the supporters of the PFP, whom I believe mostly feel exactly as I do about this incident and who accept our policies and philosophy, I say there is a home for them in the NRP. [Interjections.] Whatever else the NRP may be criticized or accused of, it has never been accused of lacking loyalty and dedication to South Africa, and even our opponents accept that. [Interjections.] The NRP is a party which can be trusted with the interests and security of South Africa. This is not the first occasion on which I have clashed on this very issue.</p>

<p>I clashed with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition when he called from Botswana for the Patriotic Front of Mr. Mugabe to be brought into an internal settlement in Rhodesia at the very moment when Rhodesia had reached an internal settlement. I attacked him on that issue. I have disagreed with the hon. member for Musgrave and with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout on their attitude to the extent to which Swapo should be taken into account and be satisfied in regard to the negotiations in South West Africa. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, both those hon. members are on record as saying that we should continue the negotiations in order to&#x2026;</p>

What the people want now, and what they demand of the Government, is a quick, clean and clear end to this whole issue, to this whole sordid affair.</p>

<p>I should like to appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister, in the interests of South Africa not to allow this to drag on for two more long months, but to put the onus on the Opposition, not as a sign of weakness or of accepting our arguments.

[Interjections.]</p>

<p>In the few minutes left to me, I should like to look at the question of what has to be put right in South Africa once this has been cleared up. In the first instance I believe we have to restore credibility in political leadership at a critical time. That refers to leadership on the part of the Government, on the part of the official Opposition and on the part of all other political parties. Secondly, because these are the things that have been destroyed, we will have to restore confidence in judicial commissions as vital elements in our judicial system. Thirdly, we have to end the crippling paralysis which is tying down Government decision-making and administration in our day to day life. Then we also have to present a strong national front to the outside world. This is one of the reasons why I have reacted as I have to what happened and has been revealed in this debate.</p>

<p>I want to end where I started on this issue. We have to get the system of government back into credibility. A government which has the confidence of the people and which has an acceptable alternative is what we need. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs said: &#x201C;Daar is geen alternatief nie&#x201D;. He is wrong. Whatever the short-term price may be&#x2014;and I know there is going to be a price that I will have to pay for what I am saying here this afternoon, because there will be those who will disagree with me&#x2014;and whatever hysterical attacks will be launched upon me by certain newspapers, I am still going to say what I want to say. I know there are certain newspapers who will attack me hysterically on the theory that should one have all Opposition parties in one camp one would be able to beat the Government. If they slaughter me that is too bad. I believe that if someone accepts the responsibility of leadership, he must say frankly, honestly and directly what he thinks about affairs. I have a duty, irrespective of the consequences, to state beyond any doubt at all where I stand. The NRP stands alone and defiant and not as part of some amorphous hybrid opposition group. We stand or fall as an independent party and as an alternative Government.</p>

<p>The PFP did not even put up a candidate in Beaufort West and they will be looking for one in Randfontein soon. The NRP does not see itself as just part of an Opposition opposing. This party must be the catalyst for a new political dispensation as an alternative Government. The NRP stands by its own identity, with its own character. Opposition voters must make their choice. There will be a new Government. The present Government will be thrown out. [Interjections.] The public must decide who they want in place of this Government, and now that the meat is on the floor, let the voters decide in the inevitable situation that is to follow.

<p>The hon. member said it in this House. I want to tell him: To be big in politics, I need not have been sitting in my bench in this House for years, because I am a member of a party that came here with Jan van Riebeeck. [Interjections.] Its foundations were laid in the Cape at the foot of Table Mountain, and then the NP spread across the Karroo koppies out to where it is still flourishing today. The nationalism I represent took root in the fertile soil of the Highveld, and its seeds were blown across the Drakensberg and green pastures of Natal. It did not stop there. It took those green sugar-cane fields by storm and captured the NRP&#x2019;s stronghold. That is why we see those funny expressions on their faces. They could not swallow that, because it was the seat of the lion of the NRP which fell. I want to assure them that they will not get it back.</p>

<p>Before the hon. member for Durban Point started joking at the end of his speech, it was an historic moment to me when he stated for the first time that he was capable of standing on his own two feet. He and other hon. members of the NRP must now realize, however, that they have taken a responsibility upon them. They must now tell us in this House what their policy is. [Interjections.] I shall take out my kieries and address my remarks solely to the hon. member for Durban Point, the Leader of the NRP. He is the hon. member who requested that Parliament should meet about the Information debacle. Parliament then met He is also the one who asked for the appointment of a judicial commission. Today he says that we must appoint a Select Committee which, according to him, will solve the whole problem. I want to ask him&#x2014;I see that he is talking to other hon. members&#x2014;whether he holds the previous leader of the United Party in high esteem.</p>

<p>I then want to quote what Sir De Villiers Graaff said about judicial commissions and Select Committees. A decision had to be taken at that time about the question of whether a judicial commission or a Select Committee should be appointed in respect of certain organizations which had to be investigated. I shall read it in full and then we shall see what the reply to it is. Sir De <span class="col_4143-4144" refersTo="page_0467"/>Villiers Graaff said the following on 10 February 1972 (Hansard, col. 731)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as I am concerned, I believe that not only would a judicial commission be a better body for an investigation of this kind, but also that the public would have more confidence in it. It is clear that the organizations concerned will have more confidence in it. In a matter of this kind it is not only sufficient that justice must be done, but that justice must be seen to be done. Of course there are certain procedural advantages attached to a judicial commission as opposed to a Select Committee. Hon. members who have appeared before both in the course of their work or who have been members of one and who have appeared before another, know that cross-examination before a Select Committee is difficult Questions have to go through the Chair, while in a cross-examination in a court of law, which is the procedure adopted for a judicial commission, the cross-examiner gets a much better opportunity than in a Select Committee. Hon. members also know that it is easier for counsel to operate before a judicial commission.</block>

<p>I submit that one could not put it better than the previous Leader of the Opposition did. He went on to say (Hansard, col. 732)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe there is something else which makes it undesirable for us to have this examined by a Select Committee. Our judgment as politicians as to what is subversive of race relations, what is subversive of the well-being of the State, subversive of matters which are not illegal, are not unlawful, not crime, tends to be very subjective indeed. I believe that in an inquiry of this kind, it is vitally important that there should be every appearance of complete impartiality and the bringing of trained minds in the legal profession to bear upon the evidence which comes before them.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. N. VAN DER WESTHUYZEN</person>:</from>

<p>I spent the greater part of my speech replying to that, but I think it is necessary. I believe that the electorate will also judge the NRP by its conduct in respect of this whole Information debacle, because the democratic means which were available and which have been used by them throughout this whole process have been undermined and are still being undermined.</p>

<p>As far as the South Coast is concerned, I just want to get the facts straight. The South Coast is no longer the same constituency and the hon. members of the NRP know this perfectly well. [Interjections.] The combined majority of the PFP and the NRP compared with the previous election, if one takes into account the part which has been added, is 2 000. The Opposition may have made 900 to 1 000 registrations and the NP made 1 000. That is not valid, therefore. I want to mention an example now. Let us take up the challenge. Any majority of less than 2 000 attained by the Opposition is a moral defeat for the Opposition. [Interjections.] That was the Opposition&#x2019;s majority at the previous election, and I am not saying that we are not going to take the seat. I say we are going to win the seat.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the hon. the Leader of the NRP. I am glad he said that he dissociated himself from the PFP and that he would have nothing to do with the PFP from now on. If the PFP now wants to show where it stands, this is its chance to put up a candidate in South Coast. The hon. the Leader of the NRP has said that they are going to follow their own course from now on; i.e. they are not going to sit on the fence any longer. They have now fallen down, on one side or the other. The hon. member for Marico said the other day that they had advertised a meeting. They said&#x2014;</p>

<p>I must concentrate on the party in an attempt to get something out of them. It has been asked before what the difference is between the PFP&#x2019;s policy and theirs. All the speakers who have risen have said that basically there is not a very great difference. [Interjections.] The one will hold a convention and the other will hold a indaba. That is the one difference. [Interjections.] The other difference is neatly summarized in this pamphlet, and now hon. members must listen carefully. It is said that persons who want to will be able to live in their own little white spot I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The use and occupation of any residential area and neighbourhood school or amenity on a &#x201C;closed&#x201D; or &#x201C;open&#x201D; basis, shall be determined by the lowest relevant authority after consultation with the communities concerned, and &#x201C;open&#x201D; residential areas and amenities shall be encouraged, and established in like manner, where required.</block>

<p><span class="col_4147-4148" refersTo="page_0469"/>That is their explanation. [Interjections.] The only difference they make is that they are going to set aside small white spots where the White people may live. One can imagine how long it will remain like that! How long will people be able to stay in those small white spots? How much friction is it going to cause? [Interjections.] We shall make it hot for this party from now on until they have told us what their policy entails. They have never said what their policy is. Hitherto, they have been masters of only one art, and that is sitting on the fence. Now they have said that they are going to fall down on this side or the other, and for that reason we now expect to learn what their policy entails. The electorate also expects to learn what their policy is.</p>

<p>I shall read to the House shortly what the hon. member for Durban Central had to say. I have just said that the winds of nationalism have blown all over the country and through the fresh South African air. There is only one rural constituency in the whole of South Africa which the NP has not been able to conquer, and that is Mooi River. Why is that? Because the chairman of that divisional council said that the hon. member for Mooi River was really a Nationalist&#x2014;that proves how good they are at sitting on the fence&#x2014;they did not oppose him. Therefore he is present in this House only by the grace of the Nationalists in Natal. That is the only reason why he is here. Some few concrete jungles like Durban Central are the only places which have not yet been stirred by the winds of nationalism, those places where the polluted air is still clouding people&#x2019;s thinking to that extent. I want to quote from <i>The Citizen</i> of 17 August, where the hon. member for Durban Central quoted statistics, among other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">75% of students intend leaving. A recent Nusas survey showed that about 75% of students intended leaving South Africa within two years of graduation.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. member for Durban Central had to say. Why did the hon. member say that? After all, there are statistics and statistics. Is the hon. member telling the students that 75% of our country&#x2019;s students want to leave the country within two years of having completed their studies? Is that patriotism?</p>

<p>Surely the hon. member cannot go to the electorate as a responsible leader of a party and allege that we fought the election on a false platform, while we have in fact produced a new dispensation.

It has now taken a stand for the first time, but we shall not be satisfied with remarks like the vague ones they made about the second report of the Erasmus Commission. The NRP is adept at making vague statements, and I find a good example of that in the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Erasmus-kommissie se tussentydse verslag wat gister in die Volksraad ter Tafel gel&#x00EA; is, bewys bloot dat beskuldigings nie bewys kan word nie, en nie dat die beskuldigdes onskuldig is nie, het mnr. Vause Raw, leier van die NRP, gister in Kaapstad ges&#x00EA;.</block>

<p>Finally, I just want to say that we in Natal are very proud to have a leader such as the hon. the Minister of Finance.

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with a budget debate which is a very important debate for the country as a whole. However, the Opposition have conveniently steered away quickly from the financial aspects of it. I say &#x201C;conveniently&#x201D;, Sir, because such a wonderful budget, a budget that is to the advantage of the people of the country, does not suit the Opposition. They would like the economy of South Africa to decline and South Africans brought to their knees in the economic field. That would suit their book. However, the contrary has happened. The hon. the Minister has presented us with a budget which will open many doors to our country in the days ahead. They are very disappointed about that and they have consequently steered away quickly from the economic side of the budget and returned to the old hackneyed story of the Department of Information. I do not blame them for being disappointed. They are in fact always trying to harm our economy. They try to keep foreign investment capital away from South Africa. In spite of their efforts, however, that capital inflow has increased and will be used to our advantage and to enhance our future prospects. That is why they are disappointed.</p>

<p>The disclosure by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs about the behaviour of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has shocked the country and its people. To think that the Leader of the Opposition could be so irresponsible as to convey something that he was told in confidence to another person! I am not saying that he told McHenry everything; I just want to say that if anybody were to tell me something in confidence, I would not even tell my bench-mate. I would keep it to myself. The electorate of South Africa has been shocked by the actions of the official Opposition. South Africa was very hopeful a short while ago when it looked as if we had overcome the difficulties encountered in the discussions on the South West African question and as if solutions would be found. However, things suddenly went awry and negotiations were in a delicate state. Sir, do you know to what I ascribe that? I ascribe it to the fact that nosey-parkers poked their noses into the matter. For no rhyme or reason things suddenly went wrong; hitches were encountered everywhere. I think members of the official Opposition should confront their Leader about this.</p>

<p>A few pertinent questions were put to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition but neither he nor any member of his party has replied to them. He was asked whether the PFP had a wing overseas. There was no reply to that. I want to go further and ask hon. members of the PFP whether they are in touch with a contact group with which they have to liaise regularly. They are silent. Can the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tell us why he goes overseas so often to visit one country after the other? [Interjections.] This action on his part disturbs South Africa and I think we should ask the hon. the Minister of the Interior and Immigration to seriously consider withdrawing the passport of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I think the wings of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should be clipped somewhat. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>On 1 April 1979 an article written by Ken Owen appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> in which, <i>inter alia</i>, he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Three men can save South Africa if they choose. Three men, and only three men can save South Africa from the calamity of the Information crisis if they will put the country&#x2019;s interests above their own. They are Mr. Vorster, the Prime Minister, Mr. P. W. Botha and their Minister of Finance, Mr. Horwood. They can only do so if they step down voluntarily from the high offices they hold so that new men can govern the country.</block>

<p>I want to know from the PFP whether they agree with this point of view of Mr. Ken <span class="col_4151-4152" refersTo="page_0471"/>Owen. There is no reason why I should not ask the hon. member for Johannesburg North directly whether he agrees with that article in which it is suggested that the leaders of the NP resign and vacate their offices. [Interjections.] The hon. member does not reply, Sir. I take it that he does not agree with the article. May I repeat my question? Does the hon. member want our Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance to resign? Sir, I get no reply from hon. members on that side of the House. Could the hon. member for Rondebosch perhaps tell me whether he wants them to resign and get out?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. B. SCOTT</person>:</from>

<p>I asked the hon. member for Rondebosch a direct question and the hon. member for Bryanston must not ask me another question. I am only asking the hon. member whether he wants those gentlemen to resign and to get out? That is my simple question. Hon. members of the PFP are as silent as the grave. They do not agree with that article. They are quite satisfied that the hon. the Prime Minister should remain in the House. In spite of all the criticism they are also quite satisfied that the hon. the Minister of Finance should retain his portfolio. They know that the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Finance are doing a good job. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us assume for a moment that the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Finance are forced to resign. Do members of the PFP see their way clear to take the government over and to rule the country? [Interjections.] They do not see their way clear to do that. There are only 17 PFP members in this House. They relied on the support of the NRP and that would have brought their numbers to 27. This afternoon, however, a nail has been hammered into their coffin. They will not get the support of the 10 hon. members of the NRP and their numbers will consequently remain at 17. Surely they cannot govern the country with only 17 members. [Interjections.] They do not want an election. The hon. member for Yeoville has said that they do not want an election at this stage. On the other hand, however, they want the hon. the Prime Minister to resign. Do they want to take over the government in that case? Surely that is totally illogical.</p>

<p>Let us assume further that such a catastrophe does hit us and that the hon. the Prime Minister does invite them to take over the reins of government and to show the country what they can do. I should like to know which portfolios each of those hon. members will hold. Time does not permit me to assign every hon. member to a portfolio but I think the hon. member for Houghton will insist on the portfolios of Police and of Prisons. Should the hon. member for Houghton be allocated the portfolios of Justice, of Police and of Prisons, every policeman in the country will be discharged. They will all be discharged and the doors of the prisons will be thrown wide open. The hon. member for Houghton hates a policeman. She is continually fighting with the hon. the Minister of Justice about the way prisoners are treated and dealt with. She will throw the doors of the prisons wide open and there will be absolute chaos in the country.</p>

<p>And the farmers? At a glance I would say that the farmers would probably be saddled with the hon. member for Green Point. [Interjections.] Surely a greater catastrophe than that cannot hit our farmers. That will be a greater catastrophe than the existing drought. [Interjections.] That is why they do not see their way clear to take over the reins of government at this stage. The electorate should take note of the fact that the PFP is incapable of taking over the government at this stage. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South said a few things yesterday to which should like to reply. I should like to have the attention of the hon. member. He said: &#x201C;We must fight for the farmer.&#x201D; He also said: &#x201C;They shut up; they do not say a word.&#x201D; The hon. member continued in this vein and said: &#x201C;They are dead scared.&#x201D; In saying that he was referring to hon. members on the Government side. According to him we are supposed to be too dead scared to state the case of the farmer. Did the hon. member really not listen when the hon. member for Bethal was speaking? Did he not listen when the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke was speaking? Did he not listen? If he did listen why does he say: &#x201C;They shut up; they do not sa a word.&#x201D; Surely that is not true. [Interjections.] <span class="col_4153-4154" refersTo="page_0472"/>The leader of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South said: &#x201C;The crisis in agriculture is an issue beyond politics.&#x201D; That is so. However, we should not drag the problems of the agricultural industry into politics. Neither must the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South tell us that we are too dead scared to state the case of the farmer.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, surely the hon. member for Bethal did so. I suppose the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South was asleep at the time. The hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke also did so. Even the hon. the Minister of Finance did so. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I have to hurry, Sir. I wanted to say something more about the agricultural industry but I shall have an opportunity at a later stage of doing that. I want to conclude by thanking the hon. the Minister of Finance and congratulating him, not only on the budget that he has presented but also on the image he personally has created overseas&#x2014;the image of a person who can be trusted. The image he has created overseas, his image as Minister of Finance, is of inestimable value to South Africa As a matter of fact, his image is as valuable to South Africa as her gold. I want to say in public what my constituents have asked me to convey to the hon. the Prime Minister. My constituents are wholeheartedly behind the hon. the Prime Minister. They have asked me to say that to him publicly. Their message to him is that he must continue, as is his intention, to govern South Africa. They give him their assurance that they support him.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance reminds me involuntarily of what the late Dr. Verwoerd said on one occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moenie dat ons ons ontstel oor die w&#x00EA;reld en oor wat hy oor ons te s&#x00EA; het nie. Laat ons ons alleen ontstel as daar in ons nie genoeg vegkrag, werkkrag en denkkrag is om dit te oorwin wat in ons pad gegooi word nie.</block>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. WORRALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for Winburg in this debate because he has delivered a superb political speech. He made a point which was also made by several other members and that is that this is a budget debate which is one of the most important debates in any parliamentary session. It is a debate in which the Opposition has an opportunity of looking at the financial policies followed in the country and of assessing the priorities of the Government. According to the newspapers the Opposition started the debate this week with its tail in the air. <i>The Cape Times</i> said that a big row was expected in the House. Tense debates were envisaged and it was thought that the Opposition&#x2019;s prospects were superb and that the Opposition ws going to take the Government to pieces. That was the approach at the beginning of this week but the official Opposition has, as the week proceeded, slowly collapsed back into a state of complete apathy, of total indifference and disillusionment. The fact that the Opposition has concentrated on matters which, although important, are nevertheless not strictly relevant to the budget issues which really count, is in itself almost a vote of confidence in the hon. the Minister of Finance, as the hon. member correctly pointed out.</p>

<p>In his speech in this debate the hon. member for Musgrave spoke of the Government being obsessed with defending its race relations policies&#x2014;not with changing these policies, but with defending and explaining them. He said this was the reason for the Information crisis. As the whole issue of the role of the Opposition in foreign affairs has arisen, I want to tell the hon. member for Musgrave that this Government, and most Governments in South Africa&#x2019;s history, have taken the view that South Africa&#x2019;s role in the world, its foreign policy, its international relations and the projection of South Africa&#x2019;s image, is a matter which should be handled in a bipartisan way. This Government has set an example in presenting the country&#x2019;s image in a bipartisan way. The hon. member for Musgrave will know that visitors who are brought to this country invariably also see Opposition members. It has in fact astonished <span class="col_4155-4156" refersTo="page_0473"/>me, and I am sure it has astonished him, to observe the wide range of people visitors to this country see. They see members of the Opposition, Black leaders and other persons of colour. The visitors who are officially brought to this country talk to people representing the whole spectrum of oinion. It was never the intention of the former Department of Information and it is not the intention of the present Information Service of South Africa simply to defend the policies of the Government. As a matter of fact, the Government and serious-minded members on this side of the House are concerned with presenting an image of South Africa in all its complexity, which includes the Opposition point of view. We are aware that we are not a monolithic society, but very much a society in debate with itself. We are a society wrestling with the answers to our fundamental problems. That has been the assumption of this Government and it has been the assumption of other Governments.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is true that individual English-speaking businessmen, for example, play a major role in the promotion of the image of this country in all its complexity and with all its problems. They present that image through the S.A. Foundation, through a variety of organizations and in individual contacts when they meet with overseas visitors. There is, therefore, a role to be played by all Opposition parties in the foreign policy of South Africa and in our international relations. That fact has not been denied by a single hon. member on this side of the House. This Government indeed welcomes the Opposition playing a role in the determination or formulation of its foreign policy. The unfortunate issue which has dominated the second part of this debate and which I believe has caused the official Opposition very considerable damage in the eyes of the electorate of this country, has arisen precisely from an act of confidence on the part of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, because it was he who invited leading members of the Opposition to come to him so that he could explain to them South Africa&#x2019;s position in regard to the South West African issue at that particular time. It was out of an act of confidence and an expression on his part of a bipartisan policy that this unfortunate incident has arisen. I want to deal with the question of the telephone call to Mr. Don McHenry, because in my mind there are certain honest questions which arise and which have not been explained by the Opposition. I just want to set out a few of the facts.</p>

<p>First of all it is a fact that there was a confidential briefing. Not all of what was imparted by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs was confidential&#x2014;that is accepted. However, as has been confirmed by the hon. leader of the NRP, part of the information that was imparted, was in fact confidential. It is also a fact that in those discussions certain statements or documents with which Ambassador Don McHenry was associated were mentioned.</p>

<p>Another fact is that, following that briefing, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition went to see a representative of one of the Western Five in Cape Town. That is a fact. Another fact he admitted in his Press statement was that he was not satisfied with what emerged at the meeting with that representative of the Western Five in Cape Town and in consequence decided to telephone Mr. McHenry. It is a fact that he telephoned Mr. McHenry. According to his Press statement, he was still not satisfied and therefore asked for an interview with the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. That second interview he subsequently had with the hon. the Minister the next day. It is also a fact&#x2014;none of these issues have been denied&#x2014;that in that interview he mentioned that he had spoken to a representative of the Western Five and that he had made a telephone call to New York. To my mind Ambassador Don McHenry is not an unimportant man. In fact, he is a very important cog in the very difficult negotiating situation in which South Africa finds itself. He is the representative of a major power in that negotiating process. Furthermore, it is of material importance whom he spoke to. He did not speak to a reporter of the <i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>He did not speak to some academic in New York and ask him what the state was of UN/ South African negotiations. He spoke to an extremely important person and in his discussion with the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs he suppressed that fact. It is not a question that he did not divulge that information: He suppressed a fact because that is a material fact. I could understand it if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had said to the <span class="col_4157-4158" refersTo="page_0474"/>hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs: &#x201C;Mr. Foreign Minister, I want to tell you that I telephoned Mr. Don McHenry yesterday and it will interest you to know that this is the latest American view on this particular issue.&#x201D; That would be understandable. That is the kind of conversation one would have expected. Furthermore, one knows that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs would then have said: &#x201C;Well, I am very interested. What did he say? What did he tell you?&#x201D; After all, it would have been an up-to-date, first-hand report of a conversation between the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and Ambassador McHenry, a very important person in this whole process of negotiation. That would have been the normal discussion, that would have been the normal conversation which would have taken place. But it did not take place. As a matter of fact, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition actually suppressed the fact that he made that telephone call to Ambassador Don McHenry.</p>

<p>The question that arises in my mind&#x2014;and it is an honest question and it is not answered by the sort of propagandistic editorial we find in <i>The Cape Times</i> today, nor has it been answered by any single member on the Opposition side&#x2014;is why the hon. the Leader of the Opposition suppressed that material fact Why did he not tell the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs something the Minister would obviously be interested to know, namely that he had had that conversation and therefore had a first-hand impression, a recent and immediate impression, of what the thinking was on the American side? But he suppressed that fact. Why did he suppress it? There are three reasons why he might have suppressed it. [Interjections.] I want to suggest to the hon. member for Houghton that any reasonable person will draw this inference. Firstly, he suppressed that fact because he did not want the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs to know of the fact that he had actually spoken over the telephone to Ambassador McHenry. Whatever the reasons for that may be, they are certainly sinister. The second reason why he did not want the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs to know of the telephone conversation was that he might have inferred the purpose of the telephone conversation. That is the second possible reason. Thirdly, he might not have wanted the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs to know of the telephone conversation for the reason that he wished in some way to use that telephone conversation or the information which he derived in the future. There are three possibilities. Firstly, he did not want him to know that he made the call, period, because of something that arose in that briefing of the previous day, because of something that was said; secondly, because it would indicate his purpose and his whole attitude towards the negotiations between South Africa and the Five; or, thirdly, because he wanted to use the information which he got, in a certain way in the future and he did not want the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs to know. Those are the three inferences which one can draw from his failure to divulge what is a material fact. Those inferences will be drawn, by any reasonable person, on the basis of the facts, and it is to the credit of the hon. member for Durban Point that he has spelt out so very clearly the concept of how a loyal Opposition should act in these circumstances.</p>

<p>I want to suggest that whilst there is the danger of a Government on the one hand sometimes confusing the interests of the party with those of the country&#x2014;and that can happen&#x2014;it is also true that an Opposition can confuse its hostility, animosity and opposition to a Government with the interests of South Africa. I also want to suggest that the official Opposition is guilty of that, and this is one specific illustration. There are, however, others. The fact is that members of the Opposition give interviews to international publications and to newspapers abroad, interviews which, in fact, write off this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown is nodding his head because it is quite correct. We recall, in a budget debate not so long ago, that attention was drawn to an interview he had given to <i>Business Week,</i> an interview in which he said that if he were <span class="col_4159-4160" refersTo="page_0475"/>an outside investor, he would not invest money in South Africa. There is that example. There is also the example of the interview recently in the 24 March edition of <i>Newsweek,</i> an interview given by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. One could go on giving countless instances of this kind of confusion between opposition to the Government or the ruling political party on the one hand and, on the other hand, what is in the interests of South Africa. This reflects an intellectual arrogance on the part of the official Opposition and a certain section, a small section, of the English-speaking community of this country. It is an arrogance which, in part, has its roots in history. It was described by Morris Broughton in that excellent book <i>Press and Politics of South Africa.</i> In speaking of this particular section of English-speaking South Africa, he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They remain habituated to principles and an outlook inherited from a social order that has crumbled away. They cling to opinions, attitudes and predictions that have, in the main, crystallized from a vanished era. Their political thinking, constantly dramatized and reinforced by their Press, mainly takes the form of seeking out and defining the sins of &#x201C;the enemy&#x201D;. In consequence they have become strange to general discourse and are shocked when it occasionally is put before them. This generates a dislike of discussion and a preference for sales talk, in which familiar views are endlessly reiterated and those of the Nationalist enemy continuously ridiculed.</block>

<p>There are many illustrations of the point Morris Broughton makes. There is, for example, yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times</i> editorial, that front-page editorial bearing the name of the editor, an article in which he says that the hon. the Minister of Finance should resign because, he says, of incompetence. There is no charge of his being unscrupulous. There is no charge of his acting dishonestly. There is also no charge of his covering up something he knew about. The charge is incompetence. There is an amazing irony and paradox in this statement. The hon. the Minister is responsible for a budget that was praised throughout financial circles in this country, and particularly by English-speaking financial circles, which is praised by virtually every English-speaking economic commentator in this country and which is, in fact seen to give stimulus to the private sector. The hon. the Minister himself is praised by these people for his competence, his guts and his courage for coming forward with a budget like this. He is, in fact, described as an &#x201C;excellent&#x201D; Minister of Finance by a political commentator who is generally critical of South Africa, but despite all this the editor of <i>The Cape Times</i> calls for his resignation and his retirement from public life. This shows an arrogance which tends to conceal the fact that Press freedom is not a personal freedom. It is, in fact, an institutional freedom, a freedom attaching to a newspaper as a whole, and therefore it must be exercised in a responsible manner. It is not simply a case of allowing an individual to express his political preferences just as he wishes. There is a need in our situation for a sense of proportion. This Information scandal has gone as far as it is likely to go. The Government has tackled the issue with intelligence, integrity and honesty. The electorate, my voters, the voters of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and other voters are sick to their back teeth of this issue at the moment.</p>

<p>I can make that inference from the experience of others. There is a need for a sense of balance, a return to a sense of proportion in our politics. A removal of the personal is necessary, in fact a return to the traditions and conventions of our politics, like a determination on the part of the official Opposition to practise a foreign policy in our politics, which is bipartisan. They should, for example, recognize the efforts of our Government in a very difficult and tricky situation. They should recognize that it has handled the situation with great wisdom, great realism and great diplomatic finesse. The time has come for them to show some recognition for these factors, for some of our journalists to recognize that there is no monopoly on political wisdom. Nobody has all the answers, and nobody is always right in politics. The time has come for them to show a little bit of modesty.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the kindest thing one could say about the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens, is that after a tortuous effort, he arrived at three inferences. He said that these were the three inferences that a reasonable person would make if he looked at the facts the hon. member mentioned. I want to be generous and not reflect upon the hon. member when I say that I shall accept that, provided that he will accept that it would have to be a reasonably half-witted person who would arrive at those inferences.</p>

<p>Before I deal with a number of important issues, I should like to refer to the rather remarkable performance of the hon. leader of the NRP this afternoon. I do not want to make a long speech, but I do want to define his performance as a remarkable case of deplorable political expediency, deplorable political opportunism. I say this because he arrived at his conclusions without the true facts at his disposal, in fact without any facts whatsoever on which to arrive at that conclusion.</p>

<p>He did not take into consideration the fact that the telephone conversation involved only two persons and that both of those persons denied categorically the false allegations that have been made by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs with regard to that telephone call. Purely for reasons of political opportunism and in the hope of gaining a few votes, the leader of the NRP saw fit to adopt the attitude he did. Then the leader of the NRP announced that in future he would never again consider an agreement with the PFP. I can tell him that most of the people in the PFP will be very happy to know that. [Interjections.] I may say, further, that the PFP, in the interests of South Africa and in order to assist the Opposition cause against the Government, decided to assist to improve the chances of the Opposition in South Africa. We have shown our goodwill. In the South Coast constituency, for instance, we did not nominate a candidate in order to give the NRP a better chance to win the election. [Interjections.] The attitude adopted by them comes very strangely from a party with only 10 members, at least three of whom won their seats because the NP assisted them. Do they deny that? At least three of them would not be here today were it not for the active support of the NP. I can mention seats like Berea, Durban North and others where the NP actively assisted them to get to this House. What is more, in at least three other seats our party actively assisted them against the NP to enable them to turn up in this House.</p>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Today we have this pathetic little party exposing themselves to a charge of political opportunism of the most deplorable and despicable kind the country has ever seen.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance, or possibly the hon. the Minister of Health or the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development, to assist the House with a very, very important matter. Twice today we have asked the hon. the Prime Minister to be present in the House in order to enable us to deal with this matter, which is very important indeed, but on both occasions when we came to that matter the hon. the Prime Minister was not present in the House. It is important that this matter be dealt with right now. Possibly the hon. the Minister of Finance is prepared to deal with the matter. Firstly, let me refer to Hansard of 8 December, col. 420, where the hon. member for Durban North said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is to find out whether there is any truth in the rumour that Gen. Pienaar, now retired, was controller of the Defence Force and that he, on the instructions of Admiral Biermann, channelled R10 million through the Special Defence Account to Switzerland. This was in approximately 1974.</block>

<p>At that point the hon. the Prime Minister leant forward and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is an outright lie!</block>

<p>Next, in the Interim Report of the Erasmus Commission one reads on page 16&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Gen. Pienaar, the then Comptroller, SADF, testified that during September 1974 at the Second Session of Parliament he sat next to Admiral H. H. Biermann, the then Chief of the Defence Force, in the officials&#x2019; bay of the Parliament Building.</block>

<p><span class="col_4163-4164" refersTo="page_0477"/>The hon. the Minister of Finance and any other hon. Minister who would like to listen to this, must listen very carefully to what comes next&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. P. W. Botha entered and spoke to Admiral Biermann. The latter then leant over towards him and said that he had to go to the Secretary for Finance, Mr. G. Browne, to arrange for certain funds to be transferred to Switzerland that same afternoon. According to the witness, Mr. Browne knew precisely that $10 million had to be so transferred and he authorized it. Thereafter the witness telephoned Major-General Strydom and instructed him to transfer the amount with the assistance of the Reserve Bank.</block>

<p>On page 17 of the interim report Mr. P. W. Botha is giving evidence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. P. W. Botha testified that he did not know at all for what the Department of Information needed the money. As the then Minister of Defence he was not interested in it. He objected to the money going through the Department of Defence to the former Department of Information, but this was nevertheless done at the instance of Dr. Diederichs. His evidence confirms the evidence of Gen. Pienaar.</block>

<p>The final sentence is very significant indeed. Mr. Speaker, you will not allow me to use the words &#x201C;outright lie&#x201D;, but I think you will allow me to say that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s interjection, on the basis of evidence of the Erasmus Commission was, if not an outright lie, nevertheless an outright untruth. I certainly would use the words &#x201C;outright lie&#x201D; if you would allow me to do so, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>By the person who made that interjection, i.e. the hon. the Prime Minister. Unfortunately the hon. the Prime Minister is not present in the House. Therefore I am not in a position to put this to him again. However, possibly one of the hon. Ministers will speak to him, will take these documents to him and will ask him to react to the facts. Apparently the facts indicate incontrovertibly that the hon. the Prime Minister did in fact make himself guilty in this House of an outright untruth when he referred to what was said by the hon. member for Durban North as an outright lie. If one would study the two sets of facts, one will find that they are corroborative of each other. There has been a great deal said about Select Committees, and I would like to ask whether this is not justification for the appointment of a Select Committee to establish whether the hon. the Prime Minister was lying or not.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Yeoville reminds me of the horse Harry Hotspur. [Interjections.] Of course, I do not want to say disparaging things about the horse&#x2026; [Interjections.] Harry Hotspur was a very good horse, a very fast horse but with no stamina. The hon. member for Yeoville always jumps up very fast and makes a lot of noise. However, after a short while he loses his stamina, digs in his toes and back-pedals like he did on Monday afternoon when he took part in the budget debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville seems to be a specialist in making allegations. He makes all sorts of allegations without concerning himself about the facts or the truth. He does not seem to be interested in facts or in the truth. The truth, in fact, passes him by like a flock of migrating swallows. Like a Walter Mitty, the hon. member makes believe that he can govern from his Opposition back bench and that he is entitled to Government secrets, and because we cannot trust him and his party, he screeches like a parrot when we refuse to pass him secrets or to let him govern with us. It is alleged that the hon. members for Yeoville and Bryanston are not interested in bad or good government, that all they are interested in is that they should have a share in the Government, whether it be bad or good. It is alleged that the hon. member for Yeoville lies awake at night bemoaning the fact that he never had a chance to get his itchy fingers on the secret funds allocated to Government projects.

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is alleged that the hon. member does not care overmuch whether the money was spent badly or well, or whether some of the money was wrongfully spent on <i>The Citizen</i>. All the hon. member seems to care about is that <i>The Citizen,</i> an English-language newspaper, dared to be impartial.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. S. COETZER</person>:</from>

<p>The fact that that newspaper dared to be impartial makes the hon. member screech like a parrot on its perch from his back bench. It is also alleged&#x2014;I do not say so&#x2014;that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is more interested in character assassination and the besmirching of the good names of other people than fulfilling his role as Leader of the Opposition and to oppose in a responsible way with a view to providing an alternative Government. I am becoming very dubious of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s <i>bona fides</i> as far as his answers with regard to the McHenry affair is concerned. When given the opportunity last Friday to serve on a Joint Select Committee to consider a new Constitution, he seemed to find it very difficult to either accept or reject the proposal. He seemed to want to suck some political poison out of the opportunity. The well-being of South Africa and its peoples seemed to be very far away from his mind. It seemed to be his intention to stir up as much muddy water as possible. It seems as if it is above and beyond him to either accept or reject anything in a clear-cut manner. If anything is too clear-cut or obvious, it seems to make him very nervous. In fact, the most simple question requiring simply &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; for an answer seems to give him the heebie-jeebies, like for instance: Did he or did he not phone McHenry? It seems that he does not relish being exposed to public scrutiny, but prefers the political murky waters where he can lurk like a political scavenging shark and can remain indistinct and hidden and where no one can&#x2026;</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition tried to use the Select Committee offer, this golden opportunity offered to him in good faith, to make propaganda for his national convention farce. He reminds me of a card player who bids and calls before he has even picked up his cards. In that manner he can only go one way&#x2014;and we all know which way that is&#x2014;unless he is in cahoots with, has a secret understanding with and obtains secret information from the dealer and knows something the other players do not know. In this case McHenry is the wheeler-dealer in the South West African issue. Sir, I am becoming very dubious about the credibility trustworthiness of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition?</p>
