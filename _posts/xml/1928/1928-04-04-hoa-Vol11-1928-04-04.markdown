<heading>REVENDE AND EXPENDITURE, 1926-&#x2019;27.</heading>

<p>In presenting to Parliament my fifth annual Budget to-day it is pleasant to recall that during the past four years each succeeding year has indicated a general improvement in the national finances, and the report which I present to-day will, I am sure, give satisfaction, not only to the hon. members of this House, but to the people of the country. I am again in the happy position of being able to announce a substantial surplus of revenue over expenditure. I make no apology for that surplus, as some folk evidently expected me to do. It has been truly said that the difference between a balanced budget and a surplus and an unbalanced budget and a deficit means in the long run the difference between national solvency and national bankruptcy. Following a series of successive budget deficits, we have experienced a succession of surpluses which have undoubtedly contributed to our national credit and prestige. That is the dominant factor in our finances to-day. The original estimates of revenue for the year just closed, as hon. members know, were &#x00A3;27,433,000 and the estimated expenditure, including supplementary estimates passed by the House some time ago, was &#x00A3;27,620,000, giving a deficit of &#x00A3;187,000, which I indicated at the time I hoped would be cancelled by savings on various votes. As hon. members know, the additional appropriation from revenue recently passed by Parliament, totalled &#x00A3;1,004,000. Of this amount, &#x00A3;435,000 representing reparation moneys brought into the exchequer and appropriated to the general sinking fund by the Financial Adjustments Act of last year, increased both revenue and expenditure. Deducting this amount from the additional appropriation, together with an amount of &#x00A3;167,000, which represents savings on votes and sub-heads not available to meet excess expenditure, we arrive at a net increase of expenditure over the original estimates of &#x00A3;402,000, bringing up the total expenditure, excluding the appropriation of the reparation moneys, to &#x00A3;28,022,000. I deduct &#x00A3;100,000 from this figure representing surrenders of grants, bringing the expenditure for last year to &#x00A3;27,922,000. According to the latest estimates received from the principal receivers of revenue, the revenue receipts for the year, also excluding the reparation moneys, are &#x00A3;29,572,000, or &#x00A3;2,129,000 more than the estimate. With the exception of the customs revenue, which can now be gauged with fair accuracy, the actual receipts under heads will not be known for several weeks, so I shall give the House this afternoon the latest figures available as received from the various receivers of revenue, which will no doubt in certain cases, be rather lower than the ultimate figures. I add &#x00A3;100,000 to the estimate to cover under estimates and I arrive at a figure of &#x00A3;29,672,000 and a surplus for last year of 1&#x00BE; millions. I do not wish to weary the House by going into the full details of the variations between the actual receipts and the amounts estimated. With permission of the House I propose to put in for insertion in Hansard a table which gives these figures. It may not be convenient to deal with them all here and therefore I propose to deal only with the more important variations of revenue. The first I take is the customs revenue. Customs revenue was &#x00A3;8,976,000 and &#x00A3;991,000 more than the estimate and &#x00A3;381,000 more than the receipts for the previous financial year. Hon. members will remember that in framing my estimates for last year, I took the receipts for the previous year and I reduced them by a round 5 per cent. In so doing I was influenced by certain considerations which seemed to me to make it necessary to proceed on more than usually conservative lines. These considerations were the effect on the agricultural production of successive bad seasons in many districts, and uncertainty as to the continuance of the large production of alluvial diamonds. I think that at the time it was generally agreed that a cautious policy was the correct one to adopt. Fortunately my apprehensions of a reduced agricultural and mineral production have not materialized; on the contrary, the value of the country&#x2019;s production, both agricultural and mineral, and its exports have increased very materially and importations have also increased, with the result that, in spite of the surrender of &#x00A3;125,000 customs revenue granted last year, the customs revenue has exceeded not only the estimate but also the receipts for 1926-&#x2019;27.</p>

<p>The small increase in the excise revenue is due in the main to increased consumption of cigarettes.</p>

<p>The substantial increase in the postal revenue is due to the extent of &#x00A3;41,000 to the receipt of moneys due in respect of ocean mails earlier than had been expected; for the rest it is due to expansion of postal business beyond expectations. One hundred and three new post offices were opened during the year and hours of attendance at numerous points have been extended. The inauguration of the beam wireless service during the year has stimulated the telegraph business through the expansion of oversea telegrams owing to the reduction of rates and the fact that a number of messages which, in the past, were handled solely by the cable company now go via the telegraph system to and from the wireless station. There has also been a satisfactory expansion of the telephone business. The total number of telephone instruments in use in the Union increased in the year from 82,000 to 88,000 and <span class="col_2815-2816" refersTo="page_0002"/>3,200 miles were added to farm telephone lines. While there has been a general expansion of business in the post office there has been a decline in the commission on postal orders which is attributed to the discontinuance of cross-word competitions. The receipts of the post office have been &#x00A3;750,000 in excess of the expenditure from the post office vote, but this figure has no relation to profit. To ascertain the true results of working it is necessary to take into account charges for interest on capital, pensions and rent, which are met from other votes and the value of the various services which are rendered mutually and gratuitously by the post office and other Government departments. When these items are allowed for it will be found that the post office is only just paying its way. An account is now drawn up on these lines annually and is published in the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s report on the vote: for the year 1926-&#x2019;27 it showed a profit of &#x00A3;626 only. This result was due to the return to the penny postage. It is just possible that last year&#x2019;s accounts will make a much better showing, but it is necessary to emphasize that with the penny postage the post office can only just manage to pay its way and there is no margin permitting a reduction of charges or any material increase in the expenditure of the department.</p>

<debateSection name="#mining_revenue">

<heading>MINING REVENUE.</heading>

<p>In regard to mining revenue, under the head &#x201C;Government Ownership,&#x201D; that is to say, the receipts from the Premier Mine, we have the only instance of the receipts falling seriously short of the estimated amount. I anticipated receipts from this source of &#x00A3;350,000, or &#x00A3;109,000 less than the receipts for the previous year. The actual receipts have been &#x00A3;205,000, or &#x00A3;145,000 less than the estimates, and &#x00A3;250,000 less than the receipts for the previous year. This shortfall is, of course, largely due to the increased production on the alluvial diggings, particularly in the Lichtenburg area. The production was of stones similar to the bulk of the production of the Premier Mine. Prices of stones of this class fell heavily in 1927, and when the time came for reviewing the price of the Premier Mine&#x2019;s output for the second half-year, it was found that owing to the fall in prices it was impossible for the company to supply anything like its full share of the trade for the second half of the year. That share, which is fixed by the interproducers&#x2019; agreement, being in terms of money, the quantity of diamonds required to supply it naturally varies with the price, and the lower the price the greater the caratage which is required to make it up. Moreover, it is evident that continued delivery of stones which were practically unsaleable, would depress prices further and accentuate the difficulties of the situation. It was accordingly decided by the company, with the full concurrence of the Government, to withhold its production for the second half of 1927 from the market, with the object of checking the downward tendency of prices and enabling the company to accumulate a reserve stock of diamonds, which would facilitate the delivery of the company's quota of the trade for the future. The right to supply the Premier Company&#x2019;s quota of the trade was sold to the De Beers Company for &#x00A3;100,000, and this sum, together with undivided profits, amounting to about &#x00A3;150,000, belonging, in due proportion, to the Government and the company, were applied in meeting the expenditure of the company for the second half-year. Notwithstanding this action, the position of the mine is still causing anxiety, both to the Government and the company, and further remedial measures are in contemplation. In addition to the deficiency of &#x00A3;145,000, there is a shortfall of &#x00A3;33,000 on the estimate of income tax receivable from diamond mines. These deficiencies are, however, practically balanced by increased receipts in respect of diamond export duty, which has yielded &#x00A3;1,175,000, or &#x00A3;175,000 more than the estimate. Diamond mining has contributed &#x00A3;1,872,000 to revenue, compared with &#x00A3;2,162,000 in the preceding year, or &#x00A3;290,000 less.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#gold_mining">

<heading>GOLD MINING.</heading>

<p>Gold mining has produced &#x00A3;1,590,000, or &#x00A3;115,000 more than the estimate by way of income tax on the ordinary mines and leased mines, and has contributed &#x00A3;1,607,000 to the loan account, or &#x00A3;87,000 more than the estimate. The total direct contribution being, therefore, &#x00A3;3,197,000 compared with &#x00A3;3,366,000 in the preceding year, when the receipts were inflated by the sale of a particular area. We received &#x00A3;200,000 the previous year in connection with the sale of a certain area.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#income_tax">

<heading>INCOME TAX.</heading>

<p>I now come to income tax. The general tax excluding companies, has produced &#x00A3;1,800,000, or &#x00A3;100,000 more than the estimate. Companies, other than mining companies, have produced &#x00A3;1,693,000, or &#x00A3;83,000 more than the estimate, while super tax has produced &#x00A3;1,250,000, or &#x00A3;150,000 more than the estimate, and the total collections of income tax and super tax have been &#x00A3;6,939,000, or &#x00A3;417,000 more than the estimate, and &#x00A3;105,000 more than the receipts for the previous year. Hon. members will remember that &#x00A3;90,000 was surrendered last year as the result of the exemption we granted to mutual life assurance companies.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#stamp_duties">

<heading>STAMP DUTIES.</heading>

<p>Stamp duties have yielded &#x00A3;950,000, or &#x00A3;80,000 over the estimate. The receipts under this head reflect business activity pretty accurately, and last year&#x2019;s figure has only twice been exceeded, in 1919-&#x2019;20 and 1920-&#x2019;21, when the figures were &#x00A3;958,000 and &#x00A3;1,018,000 respectively. Death duties show a large excess, namely &#x00A3;165,000. One very large estate was practically alone responsible for the excess we have received under that head. The other items of revenue do not call for special comment, and so far as expenditure is concerned, this has been fully dealt with in the House within the last few weeks, and requires no attention from me at this juncture.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#loan_funds">

<heading>LOAN FUNDS.</heading>

<p><span class="col_2817-2818" refersTo="page_0003"/>I now come to give the House, shortly, the position with regard to loan account and expenditure from loan funds during the past year. The estimated expenditure from loan funds was &#x00A3;13,491,000. That includes &#x00A3;21,000, which was voted under the additional estimates, while the actual expenditure has been approximately &#x00A3;11,689,000, leaving a balance of undrawn grants, which will be surrendered, of &#x00A3;1,802,000.</p>

<p>This expenditure of over &#x00A3;11,000,000 has been financed by the Treasury in the following way: There was a balance to the credit of loan account at the commencement of the year, of &#x00A3;849,000. Loans raised, less loans repaid, were &#x00A3;9,944,000, and then we had receipts other than loans raised; that is mining lease revenue &#x00A3;1,613,000, land sales, etc., and recoveries and advances &#x00A3;950,000, a total of &#x00A3;2,563,000, and these added together were sufficient to cover the capital expenditure and cost of raising loans, and at present we have a credit on the loan account of &#x00A3;1,540,000.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#public_debt">

<heading>PUBLIC DEBT.</heading>

<p>I now proceed to deal, shortly, with the position of the public debt. The public debt, at the commencement of the financial year just closed, was &#x00A3;231,476,000, and comprised stock and debentures &#x00A3;217,020,000 and temporary loans &#x00A3;14,456,000. The debt, in respect of stock and debentures, has been increased during the year by an amount of &#x00A3;7,358,000, and that in respect of temporary loans by &#x00A3;71,000. One issue of five per cent. stock redeemable in 1945-&#x2019;75 of &#x00A3;5,000,000 was made during the year in London, the issue price being 99&#x00BD; per cent. The loan was a great success, having been speedily oversubscribed. I would like to invite the attention of hon. members to the terms of issue and the results obtained by another dominion according to recent press reports. A further issue of five per cent. local stock redeemable in 1935 was made during the year&#x2014;a loan raised in South Africa. The subscription lists were opened on the 15th November and closed on the 8th December, 1927. The proceeds realized were &#x00A3;4,600,000, making the total of this local loan &#x00A3;7,000,000. As hon. members know, there is a sinking fund of one per cent. attached to this loan. The amount of certificates of credit outstanding at present is approximately &#x00A3;7,700,000. Temporary loans have been increased during the year by &#x00A3;71,000 to &#x00A3;14,527,000, and in this figure is included &#x00A3;4,459,000 representing Union Loan Certificates. The position is, therefore, that the public debt has increased during the year by &#x00A3;7,429,000 to &#x00A3;238,905,000. Against the existing debt of &#x00A3;238,905,000, there will be a credit balance on the loan account of &#x00A3;1,540,000 and about &#x00A3;19,155,000 of Union Government Securities held by the sinking fund, making the net debt at the close of the year just over &#x00A3;218,000,000. The unproductive part of the debt may be put down at approximately 49 millions. Before leaving the subject of the debt, I should like to inform the House that within the last day or so the first of our war loans has been extinguished. This loan consisted of &#x00A3;2,000,000 3&#x00BD; per cent, debentures, repayable on 1st October. 1928, representing advances made by the British Government in 1914. During the year just closed, &#x00A3;1,330,000 of these debentures were purchased on favourable terms and cancelled, the necessary funds being provided to the extent of &#x00A3;1,215,000 from the 1926-&#x2019;27 surplus and to the extent of &#x00A3;112,000 from other moneys available for debt redemption. The remaining &#x00A3;670,000 has now been purchased from the reparation moneys brought into the exchequer and appropriated last year to debt redemption and other funds in the hands of the Public Debt Commissioners, who will be reimbursed out of last year&#x2019;s surplus revenue, to which I will make reference later on. It is eminently satisfactory that it has been possible to provide for the repayment of the whole of this loan without re-borrowing, more especially as re-borrowing could only have been effected at a much higher rate of interest.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#sinking_fund">

<heading>SINKING FUND.</heading>

<p>During the year the present general sinking fund arrangements were the subject of some criticism, it being contended that the Act of 1926, which established a general cumulative sinking fund by contributions from revenue of &#x00A3;650,000 per annum, and repealed the provisions of Act 18 of 1911, which applied surplus revenue to debt redemption was a retrograde step which would, in practice, be less effective in redeeming debt than the old arrangement. An examination of the criticism directed at the new arrangement discloses an inability to appreciate the difference between the effects of a cumulative sinking fund and the purchase and immediate cancellation of stock. The difference is that in the first case a certain sum is invested annually in Union stocks, and the accumulations of interest on the stock so purchased, is similarly invested, while in the second case the stock is purchased and cancelled, and no accumulation of funds takes place. In other words, in the first case the liability of the State to pay interest is kept alive, while in the second case it ceases on cancellation of the stock purchased, and as pointed out in the 1926 white paper on the new sinking fund proposals, the amount of debt redeemed over a period of 40 years with interest at 4&#x00BD; per cent. would be more than 2&#x00BD; times as much in the first case as in the second case. A review of the position shows that if the new arrangement had been in operation from Union to the date of the introduction of the new arrangement&#x2014;1st April, 1927&#x2014;it would have achieved far better results in regard to debt redemption over the old arrangement, as well as maintaining certain particular sinking funds, and this, notwithstanding the large surpluses, amounting to almost &#x00A3;2,700,000 we had in 1924 to 1927. It is, therefore, fair to assume that in the long run the scheme introduced in 1926 will be more effective than the old arrangement, and there can be no doubt that it is far more systematic. It must not be forgotten, as I pointed out when the new scheme was introduced into Parliament, that the contribution of &#x00A3;650,000 per annum is a minimum amount, and there is nothing to prevent <span class="col_2819-2820" refersTo="page_0004"/>its being supplemented, if conditions are favourable, as they are to-day. In this budget I propose accordingly to ear mark to redemption a further amount of &#x00A3;500,000 from last year&#x2019;s surplus, which will bring the contribution for 1927-&#x2019;28 up to &#x00A3;1,150,000, and including the &#x00A3;435,000 reparation moneys dealt with some time ago, and applied to this purpose, &#x00A3;1,585,000 for the year. Hon. members will admit that this is a very generous contribution to debt redemption.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#primary_products">

<heading>PRIMARY PRODUCTS.</heading>

<p>I now intend to deal with the production of primary products. For the information of hon. members and the country, I again propose to put a statement into Hansard containing the figures dealing with imports and exports, commodities and minerals, and I, therefore, proceed now to discuss only some of the more important of the items. The comparison of both export and import figures for 1927 with the previous year is very satisfactory, and affords evidence of the strength of the resources of the country. In spite of the adverse drought the country has experienced over large portions, the export business, of our farmers especially, shows a considerable increase, and the consuming power of the people as to the remaining number is shown by the generous purchase of such things as motor cars, gramophones, and the consumption of tobacco, beers, spirits and so on. A most notable feature of the Union&#x2019;s production in 1927 is the great increase in the quantity and value of the wool exported. The quantity exported in 1927 showed an increase of 23 per cent. over 1926, and the value at &#x00A3;17,118,000 was higher by &#x00A3;4,472,000, or 35 per cent. Hon. members will remember that last year I had to inform the House there was a considerable shortfall of the country&#x2019;s production of wool for that year, but it appears that some of the wool was exported only in the other year. Conditions have improved, and we have these, to my mind, remarkable figures of the country&#x2019;s production of wool. The average value of the grease wool shipped was 15&#x00BD;d. a pound, compared with 14d. a pound for 1926, or about 10 per cent. more. The prices were very much better. Comments on South African wool in Bradford circles have been of the most encouraging nature, and the prospects of this, the most important branch of the agricultural industry, are very good indeed. The exports of hides and skins also showed a very big increase over 1926, both in quantity and in value. The value exported was &#x00A3;3,717,000, an increase of &#x00A3;1,151,000. Though there was a drop in the quantity of mohair exported during 1927, better prices were realized. The reduction in weight was 460,000 pounds, but there was an increase in value of &#x00A3;66,000, the average price having risen from 16d. to 18d. per pound. The exports of wattle bark and extract together show the considerable increase of &#x00A3;292,000 in value over the export for 1926, the figures being &#x00A3;1,159,000 against &#x00A3;917,000. Here again there has been a considerable improvement in price. The export of citrus fruit in 1927 was the heaviest on record, namely, 839,000 boxes, valued at &#x00A3;421,000, compared with 611,500 boxes, valued at &#x00A3;338,000, in 1926. On the other hand the export of deciduous fruits declined, being 1,096,000 boxes, valued at &#x00A3;222,000, against 1,151,000 boxes, valued at &#x00A3;233,000, in 1926. The export of dried fruit was nearly 800,000 lbs. less than in 1926, but &#x00A3;36,000 more was realized. The production of maize in 1927 is estimated at 18,200,000 bags. Some 3,000,000 bags of maize and maize products, valued at &#x00A3;1,680,000, were exported in 1927, compared with 1,840,000 bags valued at &#x00A3;1,114,000 in 1926. A large quantity of the 1927 crop has been shipped since the close of last year, and the total exports are estimated at something over 5,000,000 bags. Though the exports for 1927 show a considerable increase over those for 1926 they are far below the exports for 1925, when nearly &#x00A3;6,500,000 worth were shipped. The average price realized was about 10 per cent. lower than in 1926 owing to heavy crops in the Argentine and elsewhere. It is, of course, too early yet to estimate the yield of 1928 crops, but reports received to-day show that the condition of the crops is generally promising. The area planted is, however, about 7&#x00BD; per cent. less than in the preceding year.</p>

<debateSection name="#eggs">

<heading>EGGS.</heading>

<p>The production and the export of eggs continues to develop satisfactorily, and a record export has been effected in 1927, namely, 40,000,000, value &#x00A3;225,000, compared with 30,000,000, value &#x00A3;180,000, in 1926. A pleasing feature is the greater part played by the co-operative egg circles. In 1922 the circles exported 2.9 per cent. of the total, but in 1927 they exported 36.5 per cent. of the total.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#wine">

<heading>WINE.</heading>

<p>Satisfactory progress is being made in the development of our overseas wine trade. In 1927 379,000 gallons (value &#x00A3;54,000) were exported compared with 169,000 gallons (value &#x00A3;26,000) in 1926. The United Kingdom is by far our best customer, taking 283,000 gallons. New Zealand took 40,000 gallons and Germany 26,000 gallons. There are good grounds for hoping that this trade will continue to expand. The production of all minerals, other than quarry products, in 1927 was valued at &#x00A3;61,079,000, compared with &#x00A3;58,611,000 in 1926, an increase of &#x00A3;2,468,000.</p>

<debateSection name="#gold_record">

<heading>GOLD RECORD.</heading>

<p>The production of gold reached the new record of 10,122,491 ounces, valued at &#x00A3;42,997,614, compared with 9,954,762 ounces, valued at &#x00A3;42,285,139, in 1926, the increase being 167,729 ounces, valued at &#x00A3;712,475. The exports of gold produced in the Union were &#x00A3;27,389,000 in the form of bars, and &#x00A3;16,294,000 in the shape of sovereigns; in all &#x00A3;43,683,000, or nearly &#x00A3;700,000 more than the Union&#x2019;s production. This is exclusive of gold valued at over &#x00A3;1,200,000, the produce of Rhodesia, and Portuguese East Africa, which came into the Union for refining and was subsequently exported. <span class="col_2821-2822" refersTo="page_0005"/>The large export of sovereigns is of particular interest being &#x00A3;6,200,000 in excess of the amount for 1926. The countries which took the largest amount were: United Kingdom, &#x00A3;1,922,000; India, &#x00A3;3,315,000; Argentina, &#x00A3;6,737,000; Brazil, &#x00A3;1,761,000; these figures refer, of course, to direct shipments only. The demand was due in the case of Argentina to that country&#x2019;s return to the gold standard and her export surplus, and in the case of Brazil to the stabilization of her currency.

<p>Among the important gold mines the Aurora West United Gold Mining Company and the Central West G.M.C. have stopped mining. The Robinson G.M.C. and the New Primrose, although approaching the end, still continue to keep their mills going, and the Meyer and Charlton has given notice of the probable closing down in the near future. On the other hand the East Geduld Mine, Ltd., has started developing, whilst operations have been resumed by Dagga-fontein Mines, and a mining lease of an additional area exceeding 700 claims having been entered into between the Government and the company. During 1927 tenders were invited for the lease of under mining rights of certain ground adjoining the Rand Collieries, and as negotiations in respect of the tender submitted have now been satisfactorily concluded, there is strong reason to hope that the Rand Collieries will resume operations in 1928. It is not anticipated that there will be any serious difference between the production of gold in 1927 and 1928. There was an increase of 4,469 in the average number of persons employed on the Witwatersrand gold mines during the year, of whom 953 were white and 3,516 coloured. This increase brought the white labour force up to 20,620, and it is the first year since 1922 that the figure of 20,000 has been exceeded. The dividends paid by the gold mines were about &#x00A3;25,000 more than in 1926 at &#x00A3;8,469,000. A falling-off of &#x00A3;250,000 in the dividends paid by the Witwatersrand gold mines being set off by an increase of rather more than that figure in the dividends paid by mines outside the Rand.</p>

<p>The estimated value of the diamonds produced in 1927 was &#x00A3;12,392,000, or &#x00A3;1,709,000 more than the value of the production in 1926. The production of mine stones was 2,390,000 carats, valued at &#x00A3;6,194,000, or 20,000 carats and &#x00A3;506,000 in value less than in 1926. The production of the alluvial diggings was 2,318,007 carats, valued at &#x00A3;6,199,000, or 1,510,000 carats more in quantity and &#x00A3;2,215,000 more in value than in 1926. The sales of mine stones fell off by 432,000 carats and &#x00A3;1,357,000 value, while the sales of alluvial stones corresponded with the increased production. The total sales were &#x00A3;11,819,000, or &#x00A3;857,000 more than in the preceding year. The alluvial production has increased in two years from 239,000 carats to 2,318,000 carats, or nearly ten times as much, while the value has increased from &#x00A3;1,907,000 to &#x00A3;6,199,000, or more than three times as much. The effect of the unrestricted alluvial production on the Premier Mine has already been referred to. The other mines have also suffered, as is indicated by the fact that the dividends paid by diamond mining companies have fallen from &#x00A3;3,163,000 in 1926 to &#x00A3;2,175,000 in 1927, that is by nearly &#x00A3;1,000,000.</p>

The increase over 1920 is, in the main, accounted for by a net increase of 6&#x00BD; millions in the value of wool and other agricultural products exported, and a net increase of nearly 2 millions in the value of gold, diamonds and other minerals exported. The tonnage shipped (including bunker coal) was 4,401,000 against 4,560,000 in 1926. The drop of 676,000 tons in coal shipped and bunkered was accordingly made good to a large extent by increased tonnage of other commodities exported.</p>

Seventeen thousand and twenty-six motor cars valued at &#x00A3;2,865,000 were imported compared with 18,059 value &#x00A3;3,100,000 in 1926 and 18,342, value &#x00A3;3,128,000 in 1925.

The continued importation of motor cars on a large scale is remarkable, particularly as the trade confidently expected a falling off but a greater variety of cars has found a ready market. The increased importation of chassis shows the satisfactory development which is taking place in the body building and assembling industry here. Consequent upon the more extensive use of motor vehicles, the demand for petrol is an ever-increasing one&#x2014;during 1927 37,795,000 gallons were imported compared with 34,000,000 gallons in 1926.

<heading>POLICY OR PROTECTION.</heading>

<p>I now have to deal, unfortunately, at some length, with the effects of the Government&#x2019;s policy of protection. There has been a further gratifying increase in employment in the secondary industries of the Union during the past year. According to the monthly index of industrial activity, which deals with a selected number of factories in each class of industry, and which is designed to reflect only the increase in employment in factories which were in existence in July, 1925, there was an increase of 6.1 per cent. in the number of Europeans and 4.4 per cent. in the number of non-Europeans employed by those selected factories during the period of 17 months from July, 1925, to December, 1926, whereas in December, 1927, the monthly statement showed increases of 10.2 per cent. in the number of European employees and 7.1 per cent. in the case of non-Europeans compared with July, 1925. As stated in my previous Budget speech, however, this index of industrial activity was intended merely as a rough guide and not as a basis for any definite conclusions, and a detailed comparison could only be made when the results of the Industrial Censuses for 1925-&#x2019;26 and 1926-&#x2019;27 were rendered available. The preliminary results of the 1926-&#x2019;27 industrial census are now to hand. Taking the figures for privately-owned factories only, i.e., excluding railway workshops and all other Government or municipal undertakings, there was an increase of 15.1 per cent. in the average number of European employees during the two years from 1924-&#x2019;25 to 1926-&#x2019;27, compared with an increase of 11.6 per cent. in the case of non-Europeans. The actual number of Europeans employed in private factories increased from an average of 53,380 in 1924-&#x2019;25 to 57,405 in 1925-&#x2019;26 and 61,448 in 1926-&#x2019;27, i.e., at the rate of slightly over 4,000 per annum. As regards Government and municipal undertakings, the employment figures for 1926-&#x2019;27 are not yet available, but in 1925-&#x2019;26 there was an increase of 2,744 European employees over the previous year. Thus, in the first complete year of the revised tariff there was a total increase of almost 10 per cent. in the employment of Europeans in the secondary industries of the Union. The average rate of increase in the population of the Union is, of course, only about 2 per cent. per annum. If this is compared with the above-mentioned <span class="col_2825-2826" refersTo="page_0007"/>increase of almost 10 per cent. in 1925&#x2019;26 in the number of European employees in all factories, or the increase of over 15 per cent. in the two years 1925-&#x2019;27 in the case of private factories only, it becomes abundantly clear to what appreciable extent the policy of protecting and encouraging secondary industries as a means of widening the field for the employment of Europeans in the Union has succeeded within the short space of one or two years.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, as a result of the severe limitations imposed by nature on many of our farming and mining enterprises, we have already reached the stage where the expansion of our primary industries does not keep pace even with the natural increase in our population. During the war and for almost two years thereafter the abnormal conditions had produced an artificial stimulus to industrial development in the Union, while a large number of men were directly or indirectly engaged in war operations of one kind or another; But, with the completion of demobilization and the commencement of the general depression towards the end of 1920, the problem of creating new and permanent avenues of employment came to the forefront. The incidental protection, which had been enjoyed by our secondary industries under the war and post-war conditions, and which had been a factor of great importance in the prevention of serious unemployment, had obviously to be replaced in some cases, in part at any rate, by a system of tariff protection consisting of higher customs duties on the finished articles and the free admission of certain materials required for manufacturing purposes in the Union. With a few exceptions, however, such as boots and shoes, flour, cement and condensed milk, no increased protection was granted during the critical period from 1920 to 1925, and the inevitable consequence was acute unemployment and a severe restriction of immigration.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It was not until 1925 that a policy of protection was definitely and systematically brought into effect, but it was fully realized that, unless it was based on clearly defined principles and administered with caution and discrimination, protection to the secondary industries was fraught with great danger to the primary industries, and consequently protection was applied and offset in such a manner as not to raise the cost of production as a whole in the case of such industries. In connection with the opportunities for employment afforded by the primary industries, it must be borne in mind that farming and mining are, and always have been, based principally on the employment of native and other coloured labour. For example, in December, 1927, the total number of Europeans employed in all the mines and metallurgical works, as well as the alluvial diamond diggings, was only 39,000&#x2014;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thomas_smartt">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, for that year. The hon. member probably has in mind the figures that we have heard giving thousands of people actually digging on the alluvial diggings. Well, of course, there is a difference of opinion as regards the actual numbers. The hon. member will find, if the true statistics are gone into, that the number is not so great as probably some other hon. members think. As I was saying, the total number of Europeans employed in all the mines and metallurgical works, as well as the alluvial diamond diggings in December, 1927, was only 39,000, compared with almost 310,000 non-Europeans, i.e., in the proportion of about eight non-Europeans to one European, whereas in 1926-&#x2019;27, 61,400 Europeans and 109,400 non-Europeans were employed in privately-owned factories only, i.e., in the proportion of 1.8 non-Europeans to one European. Moreover, as already shown, the tendency under the new policy of protection is for the European employees in manufacturing industries to increase more rapidly than the non-Europeans, namely, 15.1 per cent. in the former and 11.6 per cent. in the latter case in the two years 1925-&#x2019;27. Thus under the prevailing conditions and tendency of the Union, the secondary industries offer far greater scope for the employment of Europeans than the mining and other extractive industries.</p>

<p>No, all I know is that the number of Europeans who left the land before the inauguration of this policy was much larger than it is at present. We regret very much that large numbers of Europeans are continually leaving the land, and that is the reason for this policy. It is realized, however, that the development of secondary industries must not be stressed unduly, and should be stimulated by protective measures only to the extent that it appears to be absolutely necessary for the purpose of filling the gap in our economic organization which has been caused by the inability of the primary industries themselves to provide for a growing population. That is the great effect in connection with this policy. We have to see what can be done in connection with these industries and to place them in a position to absorb our growing population of the land.</p>

<p>It is further realized that the primary industries themselves must be encouraged and developed by all possible means, not only because in effect they set the pace for the general economic development of the country, but also as they largely determine the extent of the local market for the products of secondary industries. On the other hand, it must be taken into consideration that the secondary industries provide a very valuable market for the products of intensive farming, especially those which cannot be profitably exported owing to high production costs brought about, in most cases, by adverse climatic conditions or relatively low fertility of the soil. In these cases the growth of the secondary industries undoubtedly plays an important part in the expansion of the local market and the consequent development of intensive farming. The farmers, however, are not only interested in tariff protection from this point of view, but also on account of the vital protection enjoyed by them under the tariff in connection with many of their products. With the exception of freight of green vegetables (other than potatoes and onions), which cannot in any case be satisfactorily transported over long distances, and such articles as wool and cotton, in which case almost the entire local production has to be exported, no agricultural and pastoral products are admitted into the Union free of duty, except, of course, from Rhodesia, South West Africa and the Native Territories. On the contrary, protective duties are levied on a great number and variety of farm products. As regards the development in individual manufacturing industries during the two years from 1924-&#x2019;25 to 1926-&#x2019;27, there was an increase of 29.5 per cent., in the number of Europeans employed in the furniture industry, 28.5 per cent. in the clothing industry, 19.5 per cent. in the manufacture of printed matter and stationery, 14 per cent. in the manufacture of leather and leather ware, chemical soap and candles and vehicles and 11 per cent. in the metal and engineering industry. Since the industrial census of 1926-&#x2019;27 was taken, there has been further industrial expansion in the Union.</p>

<debateSection name="#new_factories">

<heading>NEW FACTORIES.</heading>

<p>For example, according to the monthly statement of industrial activity, there was a further increase of 2.2 per cent. between June and December, 1927, in the number of Europeans employed in those selected factories which were already in existence in July, 1925. In addition, an appreciable number of new factories was erected in 1927. According to statistics obtained from the chief inspector of factories, the registrations of new premises for manufacturing purposes in 1927 numbered 719, with over 9,000 employees. In this connection, of course, it must be borne in mind that many of these registrations represent new premises occupied by established firms, employing usually more than in the old premises, but not by the number included in the above mentioned figures, while in some cases existing premises were taken over by new firms and registered under new names. On the whole, however, the large number of registrations reflect the continued progress made in industrial development, namely, 719 in 1927, compared with 662 in 1926, 597 in 1925, and 440 in 1924. As further evidence of industrial expansion may be mentioned, the importation of industrial machinery and materials for manufacturing purposes. In 1927 the value of fixed plant and machinery for installation in new factories amounted to &#x00A3;229,000, and that of other industrial machinery &#x00A3;717,000, while the value of materials for industrial purposes admitted free under rebate amounted to &#x00A3;1,449,000 for 1927, compared with &#x00A3;903,000 in 1925 and &#x00A3;435,000 in 1924.</p>

<p>Finally, as I stated in my previous Budget speech, and in accordance with the principles on which the revision of the tariff was based, the Government&#x2019;s policy of protection has not had the effect of increasing the cost of living to the ordinary consumer or the cost of production to the primary industries.</p>

<p>This is to be attributed mainly to the various tariff readjustments and the reductions in the duties on certain articles of household or industrial use, in conjunction with the safeguards which were introduced into the tariff for the special purpose of obviating a rise in the price of local manufactures as far as possible. During the period of almost three years since the revised tariff came into force, there has been no occasion to exercise the power vested in the Governor-General under Section four of the Tariff Act, namely, that of reducing protective duties in cases where manufacturers have been found to charge unduly high prices for their products. A few isolated complaints have been made to the Board of Trade and Industries, but these were satisfactorily settled on the whole, after the matter was brought to the attention of the manufacturers concerned, and adjusted or explained.</p>

It is convenient for all parties now to state that we are ready to accept responsibility for a sound and reasonable scheme. We have no desire to embark upon what has often been called a socialistic experiment discouraging thrift or to encourage a policy of doles or largesse, but the State has to undertake its legitimate duty of softening the hardships of poverty to the aged. With effect from the 1st January, 1929, it is proposed to grant old age pensions to persons of small means who have reached the age of 65 years. The Bill will be introduced very shortly, and it is unnecessary to go into detail on the proposals in this statement, beyond saying that a pension for whites is to be &#x00A3;30 per annum, for coloured persons &#x00A3;18 per annum, the means limit being &#x00A3;54 and &#x00A3;36 respectively. If the means are below &#x00A3;24 and &#x00A3;18 respectively, full pension will be paid, and as the means increase to &#x00A3;51 and &#x00A3;33 respectively, the pension will taper off. The maximum is &#x00A3;30 in the case of whites, and &#x00A3;18 coloured.</p>

<p>No. The cost of the scheme allowing for the conversion of Oudstryders grants is estimated at &#x00A3;780,000 for 1929 plus say, 3 per cent. or &#x00A3;23,000 for administration. This allows for 18,500 Europeans at &#x00A3;30 and 13,500 coloured at &#x00A3;18. On this basis the total cost would be &#x00A3;798,000, but as some of the pensions will not be paid at the maximum rates of &#x00A3;30 and &#x00A3;18, respectively, it is considered that the total expenditure will not exceed &#x00A3;780,000 for the first full year. The cost will increase annually by about 3&#x00BD; per cent. It will be necessary to defer bringing the scheme into operation until January 1st, 1929, so as to give time to get the administrative machinery into working order. The estimates provide for &#x00A3;90,000 for Oudstryders pensions which it is considered will be sufficient to meet requirements until 1st January, 1929, and to meet the expenditure on old age pensions for the first quarter of 1929 an additional &#x00A3;200,000 will be required.</p>

<p>Then a very considerable outlay will have to be made to repair the damage caused to irrigation works by the recent floods. The works in question have been constructed from loan funds and are the subject of loans to boards, but as the question of writing off portions of these loans is under consideration it is felt it would not be wise to increase the capital debts at this stage, but that the expenditure on reconstruction and repairs should be charged to revenue. I am therefore providing &#x00A3;100,000 which, as far as can be judged, should be sufficient to meet these expenses and to have something over for any irrecoverable expenditure which may still have to be made in connection with the relief of distress arising through the recent drought. The great bulk of this expenditure will be for advances for the purpose of re-stocking, and being recoverable will be provided in the loan vote, but there may also be a certain amount of irrecoverable expenditure which will be met from this provision and for which a supplementary estimate will be submitted in due course.</p>

<debateSection name="#revenue_1928-&#x2019;29">

<heading>REVENUE, 1928-&#x2019;29.</heading>

<p>As regards the revenue for 1928-&#x2019;29 I shall lay on the Table this afternoon estimates of the revenue based on the present rates of duties and taxes. From this it will be seen that I estimate the revenue at &#x00A3;28,491,000 which compares with the receipts of &#x00A3;29,672,000 for the current year. The revenue for last year was inflated by the unprecedented production of alluvial diamonds the proceeds of sale of which passed rapidly into circulation and increased consumption and importations. So far as the revenue of the State is concerned, the bad effects of this production on the regular producers have only begun to be felt in the year just closed, for the profits of mining for the greater part of our financial year do not fall to be taxed until the succeeding financial year, and there is no doubt whatever, firstly, that we shall derive a very much less revenue from the mines in the current year than last year, and secondly, that the output of alluvial diamonds will fall off materially, and this through the export duty will affect the revenue to the extent of 10 per cent. of the reduced <span class="col_2831-2832" refersTo="page_0010"/>value of the production. The drought which we have been experiencing over large areas of the country has only just broken, but in many areas the rainfall has been patchy, so that from the agricultural point of view a better season than last year&#x2019;s is hardly to be expected, nor can we look for a materially increased production of minerals. In these circumstances I find it impossible to budget for a revenue approaching last year&#x2019;s. I anticipate a reduction of &#x00A3;460,000 in the customs revenue compared with last year&#x2019;s receipts, a reduction of &#x00A3;480,000 in the revenue from diamonds of which receipts from the Premier Mine account for &#x00A3;40,000, export duty for &#x00A3;325,000, and income tax for &#x00A3;115,000. Then there is the excess of &#x00A3;165,000 on the death duties for last year which cannot he expected to recur. The estimate of revenue under other heads remains at about last year&#x2019;s figure except that the normal increase is allowed for in the case of post office receipts.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#taxation_increased">

<heading>TAXATION INCREASED?</heading>

<p>It will be convenient to deal with two charges that have been levelled at my financial administration. The first is that I have increased the taxation through the customs by an enormous sum. What are the facts? Taking the figures for the year 1924, the last year before the new tariff came into force, and which entailed an increase in duties on certain commodities largely as the result of the adjustment of the British preference, it will be found that the duty collected represented 12.63 per cent. of the value of the imports excluding imports from other South African states, Union Government stores and specie. In 1925 the ration was 13.14 per cent.; in 1926 13.09 per cent. and in 1927 13.30 per cent. The increase since 1924 in the average rate of duty on imported goods has been accordingly less than three-fourths of 1 per cent. and this increase in the rate applied to the 1927 imports which are the highest of the period amounts to only about &#x00A3;450,000. It is clear, therefore, that the increased yield of customs duty (which was some &#x00A3;1,650,000 more in 1927 than in 1924) is due only to a slight extent to the increase in the duties, and, in the main, to increased importations. The increase in the imports for 1927 over 1924 being 9.4 millions on which figure the old rate of duty (12.63 per cent.) amounts to nearly &#x00A3;1,200,000. The second point is that I grossly underestimated the customs revenue for 1927. I have already shown that the increase over the figure for 1926 was due to increased importations in 1927. It is true that I anticipated a reduction in importations, and I think that the position a year ago justified a cautious estimate. I have shown that mainly owing to the increased quantity and value of the exports of wool and the increased output of alluvial diamonds, the exports for 1927 exceeded those for 1926 by &#x00A3;10,000,000, a figure which no one a year ago would have believed possible. It is, of course, this great increase in the production and exports of the country which has brought about the increase in the imports and is responsible for the surplus shown to-day.</p>

<heading>BALANCE OF TRADE.</heading>

<p>I have been told that I ought to have based my estimate on the &#x201C;balance of trade&#x201D;. I do not know if my critics wish me to pursue those elusive and insubstantial phantoms &#x201C;invisible imports and exports&#x201D;. For practical purposes one&#x2019;s estimate must be founded on an estimate of the production of the country and with variable seasons, fluctuating prices of commodities and new discoveries of minerals complicating the position, it is difficult enough in all conscience to foretell what the ensuing year will bring forth. The only safe course is to take all known facts into consideration and to proceed with caution. That course I followed last year, with the result that the country is financially in a comfortable position today; and I propose to follow it again. To summarize the position, the expenditure for the year has been given as &#x00A3;28,498,000 and the revenue as &#x00A3;28,491,000, giving a deficit of &#x00A3;7,000, that is to say, for all practical purposes, equilibrium, so far as the operations for the current year, taken by themselves, are concerned.</p>

<heading>PIECE GOODS.</heading>

<p>And the first item that has been selected is cotton piece goods. The existing duties on cotton piece goods containing 50 per cent. or more of cotton are divided into two classes and are dependent upon the free on board cost per yard of the material, as follows: that costing 1s. 3d. and less per yard is liable to a duty of minimum 5 per cent., maximum 10 per cent., and on that costing over 1s. 3d. per yard the rate is minimum and maximum 10 per cent. ad valorem. In the case of British cotton piece goods costing 1s. 3d. and less per yard, the minimum rate of 5 per cent. applies, and in respect of all others the maximum rate is applicable. Cotton piece goods are in general use, and are required for making up into various articles of clothing, and in order to reduce the cost thereof to the consumer and to encourage home industries and to accord a further means of protection to the shirt and other industries, it is proposed to reduce the duties by 5 per cent. as follows: Cotton piece goods the f.o.b. price of which does not exceed 1s. 3d. per yard, ad valorem minimum duty will be free, maximum duty will be 5 per cent. Cotton piece goods the f.o.b. price <span class="col_2833-2834" refersTo="page_0011"/>of which exceeds 1s. 3d. per yard, ad valorem, minimum duty will be 5 per cent., maximum duty will be also 5 per cent.

<heading>DUTY ON FOOTWEAR.</heading>

<p>The duty on boots and shoes was raised from 20 per cent. to 30 per cent. by Act 23 of 1923, with the proviso that it would be reduced by per cent. on March 31st, 1928, and thereafter by 2&#x00BD; per cent. every year until it again reached 20 per cent. This proviso was re-enacted in Act 36 of 1925. The question of the reduction of this duty has been carefully considered by the Board of Trade and Industries, who has reported that its effect would be de trimental to the industry. It is unnecessary to go at length into the details of this report, which will be laid on the Table. It is sufficient to say that the Government has decided to act upon it and to retain the duties at the level of 30 per cent., and with this object in view, and to prevent an awkward hiatus between March 31st and to-day with a lower rate of duty in force, I tabled last week a Notice of Motion which will have the effect of maintaining the 30 per cent. rate undisturbed. This decision of the Government will create a difference of opinion. It, no doubt, will be argued that at a recent by-election the Government&#x2019;s declared policy of protection was ignominously turned down. I am of opinion that, notwithstanding this verdict, the Government should not grow weary in well doing, and the best interests of the country will be served by maintaining protection.

<debateSection name="#income_tax">

<heading>INCOME TAX.</heading>

<p>The concessions which the prosperous state of the country&#x2019;s finances makes it possible to grant to income taxpayers are two in number, one a smaller matter, which, it is hoped, will remove a sense of grievance which has not infrequently been ventilated in the House, and the other a concession of considerable magnitude which will give relief to a much larger body of income tax payers. The first of these concessions is the abolition of the present system of taxing debenture interest at the source. The second is the allowance of a rebate of 20 per cent. on all payments of normal income tax (other than those paid by gold and diamond mining companies) which are made in respect of the year of assessment ended 30th June, 1928. As hon. members are doubtless aware, the existing Act effects the taxation of debenture interest at the source by prohibiting its allowance as a deduction. The interest paid is thus taxed as portion of the income of the company which pays it out, though the company is given the right of passing on the taxation by deducting it from the interest paid. Until the passing of Act 40 of 1925, the effect of this provision was that the interest paid tax at the rate imposed upon companies. That Act, however, limited the liability of the company on that portion of its income (and so of the debenture holders on the interest received) to the maximum rate chargeable in the case of individuals. The existing system was based frankly upon expediency. Debentures in Union companies are largely held outside the Union, and the interest is in many instances payable upon the presentation of bearer coupons. By no other system was it possible to ensure the collection of tax on the whole of the debenture interest arising from sources within the Union. It was appreciated that some hardship was imposed upon small holders who would not otherwise not have been chargeable with tax. But the loss of revenue which would be inevitable under any other system, could not be faced in the circumstances then prevailing. Conditions now make that possible. There will be a loss of revenue resulting in part from the relief from taxation of the interest received by persons below the taxation limit, and in part in the escape of the interest whose recipients cannot be traced. That is estimated to amount to some &#x00A3;50,000 in respect of each tax year. Hon. members will see that probably a number of people would not be taxable. In the other cases you will not he able to collect it from those people. That is the difficulty we experienced at the time the Act was passed. But the House will be freed, it is hoped, from future recitals of the grievance of the &#x201C;poor widow&#x201D;. The House will understand that there is no intention to exempt debenture interest generally. It will in future be liable for normal tax in the hands of the recipient <span class="col_2837-2838" refersTo="page_0013"/>in the same way as any other form of income. The abolition of the ban upon deduction in the determination of taxable income will accordingly be balanced by the repeal of the presently existing exemption of this interest from normal tax. The second, and more important concession which our present prosperity makes possible, will take the form of a rebate of 20 per cent. on all normal tax paid in respect of the year of assessment ending 30th June, 1928, other than that paid by companies carrying on gold and diamond mining.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I have not considered the position as far as the provinces are concerned. It is to be emphasized that the relief granted is by way of rebate for the current year of assessment only. The statutory rates to be fixed by the annual Act will be unchanged from those fixed last year. Those will remain as the standard basis of taxation, the relief constituting a reduction of the tax determined by the application of those rates. By adopting this method it is possible to make the relief given accord with the financial prospects of the moment without creating uncertainty by variations in the established statutory rates of taxation. It is estimated that the cost of this rebate over the whole year of assessment will amount to &#x00A3;720,000. These remissions of income tax will benefit directly about 68,000 individual taxpayers, besides a large but uncertain number who will benefit directly and indirectly through the rebate of the tax on companies, and the allowance of debenture interest as a deduction from the income of companies in the determination of taxable income.</p>

<p>The remission of taxation proposed is, accordingly, in the case of customs duty a round half million for a full year, and in the case of income tax &#x00A3;770,000 for a full year, or &#x00A3;1,270,000 in all, that is to say, &#x00A3;20,000 more than the amount of last year&#x2019;s surplus remaining after the application of &#x00A3;500,000 to debt redemption. The full effect of these remissions will not, however, be experienced this year. The remissions of customs duty will not have effect until the Tariff Act is passed, which will be during May. The amount of revenue to be surrendered during the current year may, therefore, be put at &#x00A3;425,000 in respect of the customs. In the case of the income tax, it is expected that the amount of revenue surrendered this year will be &#x00A3;640,000, and that &#x00A3;130,000 will be applicable to assessments collected after the close of this financial year. The total amount of revenue surrendered this year is, therefore, &#x00A3;1,065,000, and a further surrender of &#x00A3;205,000 will be made next year. Of the surplus of &#x00A3;1,250,000 carried over into the current year, &#x00A3;1,065,000 will be absorbed by surrenders of revenue made this year, and as this year&#x2019;s revenue and expenditure should balance, &#x00A3;185,000 of the surplus should remain in hand at the close of the year, and this again will be absorbed by the surrenders of revenue which will fall into next year. The balance of last year&#x2019;s surplus is &#x00A3;185,000, the 1928-&#x2019;29 deficit is &#x00A3;7,000, and the surrenders of revenue falling into next year are &#x00A3;205,000. The apparent shortage is, therefore, &#x00A3;27,000, which is, of course, negligible, and we may safely leave that to take care of itself.</p>

<heading>SOUND FINANCIAL POSITION.</heading>

<p>I shall only permit myself a few more concluding remarks. I have tried to state the position as fairly as possible without any laudation of party achievement. I think we can all rejoice at the soundness of the financial position of the country. There are three special features of this budget which give me, personally, the greatest satisfaction. One is that it has been possible for us not only to discharge our obligations to posterity by making a very generous contribution to debt redemption, but also to lighten the burden of taxation by the very substantial reductions and concessions which I have proposed, affecting, as they will, every taxpayer in the country, and above all to introduce a very necessary wise and humane measure of social reform. South Africa is going ahead, and her citizens are entitled to face the future in a spirit of optimism and confidence. I now beg to lay on the table the Estimates of Revenue for this financial year, and to give notice of certain resolutions, taxation proposals, in regard to customs duty and income tax that appear on the order paper, and I also lay on the Table the statements showing the various remissions of duties and reductions.</p>

<p>The promise I gave this House a couple of days ago that the Government is quite prepared to meet the request which has been made from this side of the House as well as the other, to exempt bona fide farmers who produce or manufacture commodities from materials or produce which they themselves have grown. This little Bill is an unusual Bill in this regard, that the whole subject-matter has already been very fully discussed even before the Bill was introduced. It is unnecessary for me, therefore, to go into any very great details on the matter. The Bill speaks for itself. There is one clause in the main Act which deals with the exemption of farmers and that is sub-section (2) of Section 2. That clause was inserted for the purpose of granting exemption to farmers who manufacture their own produce, produce grown by them or made from animals kept by them, and it was <span class="col_2843-2844" refersTo="page_0016"/>in order to meet those industries&#x2014;butter-making, cheese-making, fruit-packing, and things of that kind. It has been found, after ten years, to be defective in one respect, inasmuch as, while it gives exemption to the farmer who manufactures his own products for sale if those products are for human consumption, it does not exempt the farmer who manufactures for animal consumption or general use. A point has been raised in regard to the wattle industry and the cutting up of wattle trees and sending them to the mines for props, etc. They were not exempt under the Act which was passed by the South African party ten years ago, and it is proposed to-day in my little amendment to exempt these people. I wish to read out again the clause and how it will read as amended. Hon. members on this side of the House have considered the matter very fully, and there are just as many farmers on this side as there are on the other.</p>

<p>The clause reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The provisions of this Act shall not apply to any farm in respect of the making, packing, or preparation by a bona fide farmer who is also the owner or occupier thereof from produce grown or animals kept by him of goods for transport, trade or sale as food or drink for human consumption.</block>

<p>By taking out the last words &#x201C;as food or drink for human consumption&#x201D; the clause will then grant a general exemption to the bona fide farmer in respect of the making, packing or preparation of any goods from produce grown or animals kept by him, for transport, trade or sale. It seems to me that nothing could be more simple. Yesterday the right hon. the member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) put forward an amendment to exclude all &#x201C;farming operations&#x201D; from the terms of the Bill. What are farming operations? Ploughing? We do not touch that. Planting? We do not interfere with that. No farming operation is touched under the Factories Act. No court would hold that the preparation, for instance, of dried fruit or packing of dried fruit or the cutting of wood from wattle trees was a farming operation.</p>

<p>Planting trees and pruning trees and growing trees and all those things are all farming operations, but if you are manufacturing something that is grown by yourself as a farmer, you are now under the Act, except if it is for human consumption. I am going to make it exempt, no matter for what purpose. There is a difference between manufacturing and preparing goods for sale and farming operations, and the amendment moved by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort yesterday would certainly have rendered the greatest possible disservice to the farming community had it been accepted, for the simple reason that no court could possibly decide that bottling and packing jam was a farming operation.

<p>No. I say that as the Act stands you are exempt if it is for human consumption, but because the Act exempts you it does not make it a farming operation. Any court that had to decide whether a process of that kind was a farming operation or not, would have to say that it is not a farming operation, but it is a manufacture of goods which have been grown from the produce of the farm. No court would have held that this particular process was a farming operation. It is a manufacturing operation. What the hon. member wants, and what we are going to achieve, is that a manufacturing operation, providing that it is done in connection with produce grown or animals kept by a farmer, shall not come within the Factories Act, and the whole point was raised on account of the hon. member himself asking whether a preparation for animal consumption was exempted or did it fall under the law.</p>

But it is in order to give a general exemption, no matter what the purpose is, that I am moving the deletion of these words. There is no question about it. The proposal I am making in the case of the bona fide farmer who wants to manufacture his own produce will exempt him from the operations of the Factory Act, no matter what it is he is doing, and no matter whether he sells it or uses it for his own purpose. That has been considered and gone into. The hon. member need have no fear whatever. But if his amendment had been <span class="col_2845-2846" refersTo="page_0017"/>carried, and it had been just to exempt &#x201C;farming operations,&#x201D; there is no court in the country would have said that the manufacture of jam was a farming operation.

<p>I want the hon. member to have no misapprehension on the point. The position is quite definite and clear, and it is this&#x2014;anything he grows he can manufacture into products for sale, and he will be exempt under the Act, no matter whether it is for human consumption or any other purpose whatsoever, and that is a full and complete exemption for every bona fide farmer in this country. My hon. friends on this side are quite satisfied that that meets the position, and meets it well and fully, and I was hoping that hon. members on the other side would also accept that, so that we could have an agreed upon measure. If we do get agreement on this, would hon. members over there be prepared that I should embody this amendment in the other amending Bill, so as to have one Bill. I have taken the Speaker&#x2019;s ruling, and it would mean that the other Bill would have to be recommitted for the purpose of embodying this Bill, but I am not going to recommit that Bill if it means the whole discussion over again. If hon. members will agree to let me embody the two, I would prefer it, but I cannot run the risk, unless there is agreement, of recommitting the other Bill and going through the whole thing again. I move the second reading of this Bill, and I hope hon. members over there will accept it. It is an honest attempt to meet the bona fide farmer.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am only going to raise a drafting point. I see what the Minister in tends, but I am not quite clear that the Bill as it is drafted will not give rise to difficulties. The Act of 1918 is rather curiously worded. Section 1 of the Act says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In premises in which, or in connection with which, some electrical or other mechanical power or appliance is used for the purpose of preparing or making goods for trade or sale or articles of food or drink for sale for human consumption.</block>

<p>It appears to separate these two classes of goods into two distinct categories. First of all the goods for sale or trade, and then articles of food or drink for human consumption. Section 2, as amended by the Bill the Minister has brought forward, will exempt any farmer in respect of the making, packing or preparation by any bona fide farmer from produce grown or animals kept by him of goods for transport trade or sale. It only touches the one. I know the Minister does not intend that, but I only anticipate the argument that may be brought later on. It may be said that there are two distinct categories laid down, and that exemption only applies to one. That is the only point I want to make.</p>

<speech by="#gilson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GILSON</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place, I do want to express my disappointment at those empty benches opposite. We are told by the Minister that the farmers on his side are thoroughly satisfied. Apparently they are so satisfied and has such trust in the Minister that they do not care to listen to any arguments or any discussion on a matter which most vitally affects the farmers of this country. I hope it will go out to the world, the entire and utter absence of interest of these farmers when a matter of this kind is discussed. It is very interesting to hear the Minister introduce his Bill and display such complete knowledge of this subject, but, in effect, and in actuality, the Minister is entirely wrong. He has not got the slightest knowledge of the industry he is dealing with, and not the slightest knowledge of the application of his Act to the farming industry. Yet the Minister says, owing to the pressure and persuasion from that side of the House, he promises to so amend this clause that he will exempt the farmers from the operation of the Factory Act. Let us see what this is in actual effect. What we complained about particularly was that where you used machinery for preparing your cattle food, where you run a factory, or what would be a factory under this Act, for the purpose of grinding mealies or chaffing lucerne to provide fodder for cattle, you would come under the Factory Act. The Minister said he had taken the law advisers&#x2019; opinion, and it did come under the Factory Act.</p>

<p>I put it to the Minister, if I am grinding mealies into meal for the feeding of my cattle, am I producing it for the purpose of trade, transport or sale? These are the only three exemptions under the Minister&#x2019;s Act. It is perfectly plain.

If the Minister is not convinced, let him put it to his legal advisers. There is a second point; this Bill lays down that the exemption is in respect of the making, packing or preparation by a bona fide farmer who is also the owner and occupier in respect of produce grown or animals kept by him. Suppose I go short of mealies and have to buy them; directly I purchase them I come under the Factories Act. It is produce not grown by me.

I shall certainly move, later on, that the contents of the Bill be discharged and sent to a select committee, where we can put this matter right. In spite of the utter absence of interest on the other side, those members and the farmers of the country can rely on the South African party doing its best to see that this legislation is correct, and act in the interests of the country. I heard the Minister described as a &#x201C;Minister in labour&#x201D;, and by his harried look it must have been a very painful confinement. The only thing the Minister could produce was a caricature of this sort, and a deed of judicial separation between the Minister and the rest of the Cabinet should be obtained to prevent any more progeny of this sort being presented to us.</p>

I do not know if the Minister means it, but suppose a farmer is treating his milk, and a neighbour says: &#x201C;Will you treat my milk at the same time&#x201D;. He can buy the milk, or get it on shares, or make a certain charge for treating it; but he is contravening the section, which says it must be his own product. Is it the intention of the Minister that no two farmers should come together and co-operate in regard to their own products? The policy of this Government is to encourage co-operation wherever it can, and to advise farmers to come together and co-operate in the manufacture of their products and the general working of the farm, but if the Government says: &#x201C;Directly you do so I am going to penalize you under the Factories Act&#x201D; you are discouraging the very system you are trying to set up. Another matter I want to bring to the attention of the Minister is that if a travelling thrashing machine comes from another farm, the farmer comes under the Factories Act.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>I should imagine from the learned dissertation of the hon. member for Krugersdorp (the Rev. Mr. Hattingh), that he was mainly instrumental in assisting the Minister in drawing up this simple little measure. I, however, do not desire that there should be any ambiguity in the Bill, and I am sorry farming members on the opposite side are not in their place, but no doubt if the division bell rings we shall see them trooping in, and blindly giving a party vote without knowing what they are voting upon. I should have thought that if we wanted a legal opinion from the other side, the Minister of Justice would have been the one to give it. The Minister says he disagrees with me in asking that all farming operations should be exempt. My reason for asking for that is because it is a safer exemption than the one now before us. Take the case of a farmer who grows lucerne and oat hay. He desires to put that into bales and sell it, but he has to buy a certain amount of bran, mealies and molasses. As, however, these are not produced on his farm, I understand that under the Factories <span class="col_2849-2850" refersTo="page_0019"/>Act he will come under the provisions of that measure. I will give the Minister another case I have in mind at the present time. Suppose I join with a brother farmer in the district of Stellenbosch and we have a joint packing shed to which we bring our fruit and run that packing shed with machinery. I maintain that unless you adopt a provision such as I say, we shall fall under the provisions of the Factories Act. Surely, now, we know that machinery has come so much into use, and that cooperation is beginning to take hold on the farming population, the Minister must know that where two or three small farmers combine to deal with their produce in one central place, it is greatly to the benefit of the farmers and the country, and it assists export very materially, because in that place you will be able to turn out an article of one character and get a better price for it.</p>

<p>How can I keep my produce separate? The hon. gentleman does not understand farming operations. You grade your articles into a certain class. When we send our goods to a co-operative factory, they do not sell your tobacco and my tobacco, but they grade the tobacco according to quality, and credit us with amounts of first-and second-class stuff that we have sent in. Let me take a case in the Free State. There is a development latterly to establish on farms small creameries. My hon. friend referred even to cold storage. If I am a farmer and put up a small plant for the manufacture of butter or the making of cheese, and my brother farmers, or even one adjoining farmer, desires to join with me and I get from him his milk or cream and turn it into butter or cheese, I say that under the amending Bill the hon. the Minister has introduced, I still come under the Factories Act. There is no doubt whatever. The hon. member for Krugersdorp (the Rev. Mr. Hattingh) says I am right. I want to know if the farming members on the other side of the House are satisfied with the amending Bill, and if I were not right yesterday when I suggested that we should have an addition to the resolution of the hon. gentleman for the purpose of introducing this Bill to say that farming operations should be exempt from the provision of the Factories Act of 1918? I want people clearly to understand the position. I think we are indebted to the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) for making this matter clear. Whatever may be said of the advisability of establishing new industries in this country, the one great premier industry on which the success of every industry depends is agriculture which provides the food of the people. In a period when the farming population has to cope with tremendous difficulties, drought and flood and always uncertain seasons, it is no more than right that they should be treated entirely on a different basis from the ordinary commercial or manufacturing population dealing with products which they do not in the main produce themselves. If I am right in the assumption that I draw that where two farmers join together and combine their produce they will fall under the Factories Act, I say it would be advisable if the Minister would accept the proposal I made yesterday, and then we could make it explicitly plain that the Act does not apply to farming operations in any way whatever. Wherever a farmer starts doing things of that sort, he does the business on such a small scale that his overhead charges completely smother him, but if two or three farmers come together and divide the overhead charges between them they can make a decent living and a fair and reasonable profit. I appeal to the Minister. I have no objection to the Minister&#x2019;s proposal, but when we go into committee we should embody with these Acts together. If necessary, the order could be discharged and the Bill referred to a select committee. This is not a party matter at all.</p>

As I understand it, the argument is this: That the S.A. party, having exempted under their 1918 Act a large number of persons from the protection given by this Act, now turn round and say, &#x201C;They are not enough; we want more.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SAMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Those who are pleading for this to-day have not brought forward anything but a hypothetical case. As a matter of fact, they have had to distort these clauses in many regards, in order to make out the case for an amendment. Many of them, I am sure, display an utter lack of knowledge of the definition of &#x201C;factory&#x201D; in this Act, but what I wish to say to this House is, when you are pleading for the farmers, is there no other person to be considered? What about the large number of workers whom you are excluding from the protection of this Act, and who may be employed on machinery on farms for very long hours? Are they not to be considered? I <span class="col_2851-2852" refersTo="page_0020"/>hope these workers in the country districts will bring this home to hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>How?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sampson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SAMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>When they find that they have to work far longer hours than the workers in the town and that it is due to an amendment made in this House to-day, as a result of the special pleading of hon. members opposite, I hope they will keep that in mind. I have no objection to the exclusions that are made in respect of seasonal occupations and things of that sort, which evidently must be excluded under the Act, but where people are continously employed in factories on farms where specialized machinery is used, is there any reason why they should work longer hours than men in the towns? Is there any reason for that, or any ground of principle? Certainly not. It simply amounts to this, that the S.A. party, having enunciated a bad principle of exempting in their own Act, want to extend that principle and exclude a further number of persons from the provisions and protection of that Act. There was a bit of a case made out for a small amendment, and it amounts to this, that having excluded a number of persons who are employed in the manufacture of articles for sale as food and drink for human consumption, to be logical you should also exclude those persons on a farm who are employed in the manufacture of articles for sale for animal consumption. There does seem to me to be just a little logic in that, but I want to submit to the Minister that in this amendment he has gone further than is necessary to meet the request that was made by the other side. The objection is to their own Bill and not to his Bill. But he has gone too far in trying to meet them. The hon. member for Krugersdorp (the Rev. Mr. Hattingh) has just read the definition of factories. If there is mechanical power and one or more persons are employed, it is a factory and has to be registered under this Act. If there is no mechanical power, but three or more persons are employed, it is a factory. These conditions apply to all industries, but the farmer has this extra protection under the Act of 1918&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The provisions of this Act shall not apply to any farm in respect of the making, packing or preparation by a bona fide farmer who is also the owner or occupier thereof from produce grown or animals kept by him of goods for transport, trade or sale as food or drink for human consumption.</block>

<p>Now if we take this amendment and delete the words &#x201C;as food or drink for human consumption,&#x201D; it would be possible to institute any class of factory on a farm.</p>

<p>Yes. Liebigs could institute a canning factory on their ranches. They could have hundreds of employees on the place, and simply because the factory is on a farm and it is owned by a bona fide farmer, and Liebigs are bona fide farmers&#x2014;</p>

<p>They are in South-West Africa. What is to prevent any other person than Liebigs starting a huge stock farm, tinning meat and things of that sort, and claiming, because they are bona-fide stock farmers and their factory is situated on a farm, that they are exempt under this Act. I think the Minister has gone too far, and that we should limit this exemption to food and drink is just as far as we ought to go. To cut out the words &#x201C;as food or drink&#x201D; opens the door altogether too wide. If the Minister were to confine himself to the deletion of the words &#x201C;for human consumption,&#x201D; the point originally made, that only factories manufacturing articles for human consumption were exempted, and not those manufacturing for animal consumption, would be met. I can conceive of big tanning factories and all this sort of thing being started on farms, or even the manufacture of boots and shoes, and all the persons employed in those factories exempted under this Act. It would make this Parliament a laughing stock. No one wants to penalize the farmer, and especially the small farmer, but the farmer who possesses machinery and employs three or more hands in premises constantly used for the purpose of manufacturing articles for sale is in a different position. We should not differentiate between food and drink manufactured and put out for sale for human consumption, and that for animal consumption, and beyond that I suggest the Minister should not go.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes (Mr. Sampson) wishes to confine the law in its operation within as narrow limits as possible. He does not wish it even to be extended in the way proposed by the Minister himself. Then the hon. member also complains that we are tampering with the law made by this party when in power. At the time this law was passed there was no question of difference. This law was passed as a compromise, and as an agreed law. These laws relating to factories and industrial matters are always difficult, and it is only when you come to the actual application of the law that you then find the necessity for amendment. In the light of experience it is no use now throwing recriminations across the floor that this party or that is responsible. We are now asked by the Minister to amend the Factories Act, and certainly in the light of experience this House&#x2014;it is not a party question&#x2014;only wishes now as <i>we</i> have the opportunity to amend this Act, to try and amend it in such a form as to give general satisfaction. We know how the law can be applied in practice. At the time we passed it, industrial development had not taken the turn it has taken within the last couple of years. More and more you find out in the country districts factories, or rather undertakings, being erected by farmers which never existed before, and it is only now, in the light of experience, that we have the right to come forward and try and bring the existing factories into conformity with the law. Take the question of cold storage on a farm. The hon. member for <span class="col_2853-2854" refersTo="page_0021"/>Jeppes said that as long as a bona fide farmer carries on a cold storage, for instance, then he is quite satisfied that that should be done, but he does not want any further distinction. I quote again from my own constituency. There one farmer who has the means of doing it, has put up a cold storage upon his farm for storing fruit and pre-cooling fruit before exporting to the European markets. That plant cost him &#x00A3;10,000. As long as he himself uses that factory for the purpose of his own farm only, he does not tall under the Factories Act, but the hon. member for Jeppes says, &#x201C;As soon as he stores my fruit, in addition to his own, then he comes under the Factories law, and he must conform to the wages&#x2014;</p>

<p>But surely the Minister has got a wage law? He has the right to apply it to any factory. The difficulty we find on the platteland and in the country districts is this, that as soon as a farmer stores the fruit of his neighbour he becomes liable to the provisions of the Factories law. He falls under the Act of 1918.</p>

<p>Well, ask your Minister. He will tell you so. The same also takes place with farmers&#x2019; co-operative societies. Farmers are not all wealthy people, and they cannot all put in &#x00A3;10,000 for a cold storage plant. A few miles further on there are farmers with small holdings, who can only build a cold storage by forming a society. They have decided to build a cold storage costing about &#x00A3;7,000. As soon as they build that they fall under the Act of 1918.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KRIGE</person>:</from>

<p>We cannot carry on our farming operations if we are going to be hampered by factory laws. What the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) says is that once you pass the second reading of the Bill now proposed by the Minister, we cannot meet the farmers&#x2019; co-operative societies in the first place, and in the second place we cannot meet the farmer who has a cold storage and is quite prepared to assist his neighbour. According to our parliamentary practice the Speaker will very likely say that you only agreed on the second reading to amend this one point in the Act of 1918, and you will be debarred from bringing in any further amendment. In order that we can get some evidence upon this highly technical matter, and also the legal view of the Factories Act of 1918, the Minister will be wise, since he has decided not to adopt the amendment of the right hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt), to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Griqualand, and discharges the second reading and sends this Bill to a select committee. There you can call your expert legal advisers, you can call the farmers who are closely interested in the subject, and you can obtain technical evidence of every description and then come to a decision once and for all, how this law is to be applied to the country. I hope, therefore, the Minister will, on further consideration, agree to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Griqualand, and send this Bill to a select committee before the second reading.</p>

<p>You are showing precious little acknowledgment. The whole attack is only made with a view to the next election, but it is very lame. The hon. member knows well enough that the present Minister has not construed the Act differently from his predecessor. It is only a few days since someone discovered that, according to the strict letter of the law, there was a flaw in it. Hence all the fuss. The hon. member for Caledon said that the 1918 Act was the result of a compromise.</p>

<speech by="#de_waal">

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WAAL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Caledon undoubtedly used those words. He wanted thereby to notify that an understanding had been reached with the Labour party. Now, if that were so, then the hon. member should greatly appreciate the fact that the Labour party is ready to go further now than in 1918. They are meeting the farmers liberally. The hon. member for Jeppes (Mr. Sampson) finds the pill difficult to swallow, but, because he and his party respect and trust the Nationalist Government, and are well disposed, they stand by the concession. I am convinced that if the Act is still ambiguous the Minister should be ready to clear it up by further amendments for the benefit of the farming population. I agree with the hon. member for Caledon that co-operation between a farmer and his neighbours should be permitted, without the danger of their being brought under the Factories Act.</p>

<p>It appears to me that whenever the other side have a bad case and cannot answer arguments properly they go in for calling out electioneering. It is a clear sign that they have no case. My hon. friend, who is trying to push this Bill through, was in the House when the other Bill was put through.</p>

<p><span class="col_2855-2856" refersTo="page_0022"/>I did not like it at all. At that time the party was divided into two. My hon. friend, the member for Piquetberg (Mr. de Waal) is more responsible for the Bill than the hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige). It is all very well to say what you are going to do now, but it is a question of administration. My hon. friend will find out that many Bills which he intended to go in one direction have been interpreted in the opposite. In Malmesbury this is applied to a place which cuts up hay&#x2014;an outside place to which it was never dreamt it would apply at all until the officials applied it. This amendment is brought in to remedy such a case as that. You must apply it, if you want it to operate thoroughly and well, to cooperative societies.</p>

<p>I have a suspicion that a great deal of this debate from the side of the South African party is red-hot electioneering, and an endeavour to secure the farmers&#x2019; vote. It is an extraordinary thing that we don&#x2019;t find the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) and the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) preaching the same doctrine as the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson). I am not prepared to go as far as the Minister of Labour, who is going too far, but we have to support him because it is the correct thing to do. I don&#x2019;t suppose the Minister would go as far as he is going if he were in a Labour Government. Is it not ridiculous to have a select committee? A firm makes tomango, a very well-known drink, from fruit grown on their own farm, they employ hundreds of people, but they will not come under this Act, but if they were to move their factory twenty yards on to another man&#x2019;s farm they would be liable to this measure. Let us take the Imperial Cold Storage Co. Not very long ago when the South African party was in power that company was running a large number of cattle in ranches in the Pietersburg district. If they erected a canning factory on the ranches they would not come under the Act, although they might employ 5,000 men.</p>

<p>Yes. Of course they are bona fide &#x2019;farmers. Surely a man who raises 20,000 head of cattle is as much a farmer as a man who raises one calf. Let us take the position of the butter people. One of the great complaints that the late Mr. Joseph Baynes had against the last Government was that it put the Factory Act into operation at Nelsrust, where his creamery was located, despite his protestation that the materials used in the creamery were produced on his own ground. But if I start a butter factory on my farm, why should I not come under the Factories Act? A yard beyond my ground is land belonging to the Bloemfontein Town Council, and if a factory were erected on it it would have to come under the Factories Act. Is it right that there should be any differentiation for the same class of people work under the same conditions whether a factory is located on a farm or within a municipal area? To have such a differentiation would make legislation ridiculous. The case mentioned by the hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) is not even on the border line, and the South African party is straining at a gnat. There is no need to send the Bill to a select committee. The Opposition did not care anything for the farmers before, although the thing of which they complain has been going on for years, but the farmers have not suffered.</p>

<p>I am surprised at the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow). The farmer is always being urged to co-operate. Now, when he co-operates, he is punished. In my district there are several co-operations&#x2014;wine&#x2014;and my Voters send their tobacco to a central co-operation. These men are also penalized. The main thing is that when farmers co-operate the difference between them and the factories is that the farmers can never quote their price. The merchant or buyer says: &#x201C;I will give you so much&#x201D;, but a factory will say: &#x201C;The price of my stuff is so much&#x201D;. That is the big difference between a factory and a farmers&#x2019; co-operative association. Genuine farmers&#x2019; co-operations&#x2014;that can come under the Co-operative Act&#x2014;not companies which, as the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) said, can plant a little patch of mealies around the factory and call it a farmers&#x2019; co-operative factory&#x2014;but the genuine thing must not come under the Factories Act. I spoke in Dutch last night. I thought the Minister knew Dutch, but later I found out that he had not understood a word I said.

I must say that I am always nervous when the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) takes up the case of the farmers. I remember quite well, I think it was in 1918, the proposal that the Factory Act should not apply to farmers; the hon. member for Bezuidenhout at the time insisted that the farmers should actually come under it, and I think the hon. member also took up that attitude.</p>

I can see that it will be very difficult to say when a farmers&#x2019; cooperation is a co-operative society, and when not. Another instance is that which the hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) has mentioned, viz., that a farmer establishes a factory worth &#x00A3;10,000 on his farm. But suppose that another, say, Sir David Graaff, buys the factory with quite a different object, then we surely cannot exempt Sir David Graaff&#x2014;with quite a different object&#x2014;from the law.

<p>Hon. members should withdraw the motion then and let us enquire a little if it cannot be differently worded. I must say that it does not seem to me to be an insuperable difficulty, because the law states that the profits, in relation to co-operative societies of the members are limited. It cannot be more than 8, 9 or 10 per cent., but in other cases, where the profits of the person or persons cooperating are not limited, it is another matter. Hon. members opposite will agree that where five or ten or more farmers combine to manufacture their own products, and those of other people with a view to making a profit, there is no question of a farmers&#x2019; co-operative society, nor do I believe that the object of the hon. members is to exempt an organization of that kind from the clause of this Bill. But where a number of farmers together form what is nothing else but a co-operative society, I agree <span class="col_2859-2860" refersTo="page_0024"/>that it ought not to fall under the law. It does not happen only in Griqualand East, but also elsewhere that land in the neighbourhood of villages in the immediate vicinity of centres is very dear. It does not pay a farmer to hire ground there, because it is much too dear. Then there are only two possibilities, either he has to hire ground far from the centre, or he starts cattle and dairy farming on a small scale, but if he has to restrict it merely to manufacturing his own products he cannot make a living, and he, therefore, buys the milk from the farmers in the immediate vicinity and manufactures with it. Further, I am decidedly opposed to the farmers coming under the Act. I think that a farmer who does work of this kind will not fall under the Act, and in the circumstances I want to ask the Minister to go into it carefully and see if it is not possible to draft the provisions in such language that the Act shall not apply to the co-operative work of persons in the way I tried to explain.</p>

<p>The amendment which has been introduced by the Minister will certainly be of considerable benefit to the wattle industry. That I am quite willing to admit. The wattle industry has come under the Factories Act for the reason that where a farmer puts up a machine and cuts his bark, he was not manufacturing articles for human consumption. The amendment the Minister has introduced will exclude the wattle industry, and I am certain they will welcome the amendment under the Bill.</p>

<p>When the House suspended business I was dealing with the question of the wattle industry in Natal, and I pointed out that under the amending Bill this industry would considerably benefit. The hon. member for Jeppe (Mr. Sampson) in speaking this afternoon stated that the arguments of this side of the House were based on hypothetical cases. He asked for some proof or some case where the Factories Act had been applied to the farming industry.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>It has acted as a hardship in the case of the wattle industry, because that industry is not very highly developed, and the conditions which have been imposed upon it have acted as a hardship. I can only mention the case of the ordinary wattle farmer who has a machine for cutting his bark, and who takes his ordinary native labour which does the general work and puts them on machines in these small factories, and the application of the Factories Act there has been a hardship. There has been an agitation for some considerable time that wattle farmers should be excluded from this Act. I say quite frankly under the Minister&#x2019;s amendment the ordinary wattle farmer will be excluded.</p>

<p>I am not complaining, I am only pointing out that the Act has hitherto acted as a hardship on the wattle farmer. When you take the ordinary factory on a farm it is not so highly developed as a factory in a town. There has been a movement right throughout the country towards co-operation among farmers, and it is our duty as far as we possibly can to assist that movement. If we apply the Factories Act to the co-operative societies which the farmers are gradually forming, it is going to have a detrimental effect upon the development of that co-operation.</p>

<p>If we can exclude these cooperative societies run by farmers, and even supposing that later on it is necessary to apply the Factories Act, then the necessary amendment can be made to the Act. In the meantime allow these co-operative societies to develop, and when they have got to a highly-developed state, should it be found necessary to protect the workers, then will be the time to make an amendment to the Factories Act and apply it to these societies. If we can exclude these societies from the operation of the Act, it would greatly assist as a stimulus to cooperation. The majority of farming representatives in this House are continually preaching co-operation among farmers, and there is no doubt that in recent years there has been a great movement towards co-operation. In many cases small factories have been established by the farmers themselves to work up the raw products upon their farms.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>They are not manufacturers in the ordinary sense. Take the wattle industry. You cannot call it manufacture when you simply cut the bark in the raw state and bag it and export it. The only man you require is an engineer to look after your engine. There is no skilled work at all about it, and the same applies to other industries on the farms. I regard this as a very important matter, and not a matter we should deal with as a party matter at all. It is far too important and, so far as I am concerned, in making my remarks I am not dealing with the subject in any way on a party basis, but I do believe now there is an opportunity of amending the Act, we should take this opportunity of excluding these farmers&#x2019; co-operative societies. All these societies are not run to make large profits. Their profits are actually limited under the law, and if they can produce the stuff at a cheaper price it is all for the benefit of the consumer, and, therefore, we should not do anything which is going to act detrimentally to the establishment of these societies. I doubt very much whether it would be possible under the Bill to move an amendment at the committee stage so as to embrace co-operative societies in this Bill, and <span class="col_2861-2862" refersTo="page_0025"/>for that reason, in order to make sure that it will be possible to do so, I am supporting the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) that the Bill should be sent to a select committee before second reading, so that the whole matter can be enquired into with a view to making such amendments as may be necessary, so as to exclude from the operation of the Factories Act all farming operations including farmers&#x2019; co-operative societies.</p>

<p>I have listened with attention to the arguments in connection with this Bill. It really astonishes me that the people who made the Act and are responsible for it should be the first to protest against it. I regard this Bill as a great improvement on the principal Act, and the Minister has taken a big step in advance to facilitate things for the farmer. I have myself had a few interviews with the Minister on the matter, and I must say that he is quite sympathetic towards the farmers, and he showed it that he was prepared to meet them as much as possible. I thought that, if hon. members opposite wanted to amend the Bill, then they have had sufficient time, because it is ten years since the Act was passed. Now they come suddenly and find that the Act affects the farmers. If they are so much interested in the farmers, they could have taken steps earlier to amend it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the hon. member is also one of those who call themselves farmers and who woke up ten years too late. This Bill is an improvement on the present Act, and if in future it appears that further amendments are necessary, we can make them. My view is that the Act was unnecessary and too drastic, but as we have inherited it from the previous Government, we must make the best of it. I hope the other side will not longer urge the withdrawal of the Bill. Let it go to the committee stage and we can then make some alterations. I am certain the Minister will try to meet the objections. The farmer should be worried as little as possible by laws. Everyone in the House understands that, and I am one of the last who want to handicap farming. Farming does not pay to day in South Africa, the farmer is having a very hard time and has suffered heavy losses, and we must see to it that the laws affect the farmers as little as possible</p>

<p>It seems to me that the farmer is gradually becoming the wishbone.

Altogether, the farmers of South Africa get far too much consideration in this House. There is not at the moment an hon. member on the S.A. party benches who represents an industrial constituency.

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I think that the amendment which I am moving in this Bill goes a very long way to meet the case of the bona fide farmer who wants to manufacture and prepare his own produce for sale or for consumption. The hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) put up the argument whether if he ground his mealies for his natives or got mealies or other produce from somewhere else, manufactured it or supplied it to his natives, or used it for his own requirements, he would come or fall under this Act. Nothing of the kind. He is absolutely exempt. And threshing machinery is also exempt, as they are not premises under the Act. There is something in the co-operative society argument&#x2014;that is a debatable point. It is very difficult to know where to draw the line. The intention of Parliament and the country has been that the individual should be exempt, but when you get a large number of individuals combining to pool their money [interruption]&#x2014;well, there is the society of the hon. member for Worcester (Mr. Heatlie), with 235 employees.

<p>Because in the first place when he is taking produce, packing it and handing it to the other fellow he is not doing it for sale, but for the convenience of the other fellow who is sharing in the cost. The question of registering co-operative societies was decided ten years ago when the Act was passed, and it is an extraordinary thing that there has been no real complaint&#x2014;there is no real hardship on these people. Most of these places get seasonal exemption if they are packing and preparing fruit. The cheese factory of the hon. member over there gets an exemption. [Interruption.] Shall I give instructions that the seasonal exemptions be withdrawn? The hon. member (Mr. Gilson) is interested in a factory in East Griqualand which gets seasonal exemption. If they are registered as a co-operative society they cease to be farmers, and become manufacturers and packers in competition with other people. Before the present Government came into office, 16 co-operative societies were registered as factories, and since the present Government came into office, 19 cooperative societies have been registered as factories. Most of them deal in commodities, the manufacture of which is seasonal, and consequently they obtain seasonal exemption. More than that, I don&#x2019;t think the House should ask for. While the employees are not being considered in respect of the individual farmer who can erect any size factory he likes, we are not prepared to say that, where a large number of employers come together, form a society and erect a factory, they should also be exempt. That is a very fair compromise which my friends on these benches are willing to accept, but hon. members on the cross benches say the compromise goes a good deal further than it should. The Act does not affect wages, so the hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) is hopelessly wrong. The only matters in which the Factories Act is concerned are hours and conditions of employment, ventilation, sanitation, cleanliness, fire protection and the erection of guards around machinery to protect life and limb, etc. Co-operative societies and other factories engaged in seasonal trades invariably obtain seasonal exemption, and as we have met the point raised by hon. members opposite with regard to the bona fide farmer, the Bill should be allowed to go through as it stands.</p>

I certainly think this is a Bill that ought to be referred to a select committee. There are amendments in this Bill which will have a very far-reaching effect, and I think those effects should be very carefully considered before the Bill is passed. I am well aware that the first aim of this Bill, when we passed it in the first place, was to promote peace <span class="col_2867-2868" refersTo="page_0028"/>and conciliation between employers and employees. It was suggested that it was the intention to get these two classes of people together to discuss their differences, and try to come to some agreement. It has had that effect to some extent, we have got to admit that, but it has also had effects which were not foreseen at the time. Certainly one of the objects has been to fix wages.

<p>Yes, and they have generally contrived to fix it, as I said, on the highest scale. That was not the intention when the Bill was passed, as is pointed out very clearly in this report of the Economic Commisson of 1925.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Do you want to fix them on the lowest scale?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not. One of the effects which this Act has had has been to make it more difficult for the smaller employer to keep going. I know two specific cases where two comparatively small people have been driven out of the trade. I know one man, a very respectable man, who has had to go to Kenya to carry on his trade. The result has been to drive the trade to some extent into the hands of the bigger men. It has had another effect which is far more serious&#x2014;it has driven hundreds of semi-skilled men out of trades for the simple reason that the scale of wages in most of these cases has been fixed at the highest point, on the earnings of the most skilled men. The consequence has been that semi-skilled men or unskilled men have been turned adrift. Naturally when the employer has to pay the highest scale he refuses to employ those who cannot earn the wages. That has been the general practice right through. There are scores of men out of employment in Cape Town, on the Rand, in Kimberley, and, I believe, also in Port Elizabeth, owing to the operation of this Act, and the pity of it is that the majority of these men who have been turned adrift because they have not been up to the standard to earn the wages that are fixed are coloured men, so that in one way it has acted as a colour bar, to some extent. I don&#x2019;t say right through. It varies in different trades, but in some cases it has acted as a colour bar in keeping the coloured man out of employment. It has also had this effect, that it has kept coloured youths out of employment. The most skilled men in a trade are, as a rule, Europeans, and they refuse in most cases to take coloured youths as apprentices. I know of two cases which have been brought to my notice, where they have specifically refused. I know one employer who said he had been told quietly by men in his employ that if a half-coloured youth was brought in, as an apprentice, they would go out. There is another case where a coloured youth whose father had been in the present trade was refused as an apprentice by the men employed in that trade, and it was only on very strong pressure that the matter was fixed up. Coloured youths of this city are to-day to a large extent being excluded from apprenticeship as a result of this Act. There is also another point, that it has increased the cost of building very materially, certainly in the big cities, because though the cost of materials has fallen the cost of wages has so been increased that upon the whole the cost of building in South Africa to-day is up about 15 per cent. on account of those wages.</p>

What right have you to drive a man out of his trade because he does not happen to come up to a certain standard and because he is prepared to work for a smaller wage? To my mind it is an oppressive Bill which enables a certain section, the highest skilled in the trade, to oppress the smaller men.</p>

They have not succeeded yet, and so long as this Act operates they never will do so. Unemployment has become a permanent institution in South Africa. How is the poor beggar who is not fully skilled going to get work? The trade is fairly prosperous, and yet we have this amount of unemployment, and there is more work than can be got through. That may be the case but still, there they are, a lot of unemployed people. It is simply hopeless. How can you expect the semi-skilled man to be able to get work? He cannot work on the wages you lay down. It is practically a monopoly in the hands of the highest skilled men. You have increased the cost of building as I have shown. You have increased wages, so what else can you expect but to increase the cost of building?</p>

<p>Don&#x2019;t try to put it off like that. I am dealing with the Act as it is to-day. Your object is to make it much worse in the application of it. Take furniture. The cost has been put up at least 15 per cent. by the increased wages, and thus the thing goes on right through. The object of this Bill undoubtedly is to strengthen the position of the employee as against the employer. Look at Clause 3 (b). That is the result of an action we had in Cape Town that in case it is a matter of arbitration under the Act as proposed to be amended they can only call in men who are in the trade to arbitrate.</p>

It is not in his interest to make peace. Left to the people in the trade itself they would be far more likely to come to terms than they will under the Act as amended. Take 3 (a); that is extremely important, and is going to lead to a great deal of worry&#x2014;&#x201C;the deletion of the proviso hereto&#x201D; which simply means that: under the proviso of Clause 4, it is laid down that in a dispute where there were only two concerned, one man and the employer, it was not possible to call for a conciliation board without the consent of the Minister, and it could be done only where principles were involved.</p>

It has pretty well destroyed the gold mining industry in Australia. The value of the gold produced in Australia was reduced in 1924 to &#x00A3;3,000,000, whereas the output in 1911 was valued at &#x00A3;76,000,000.</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I am just showing the evil effect of such legislation. It will have exactly the same effect here as in Australia, and that has been pointed out by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow). Farming is, perhaps, the worst paid occupation in South Africa. The farmer cannot afford to work only 8 hours a day; he has to labour from sunrise to sunset. The result of his work is very uncertain. The farmer is often afflicted with droughts or floods, while the price he will obtain for his produce is uncertain, and he has to compete with the overseas producer. We are on a wave of prosperity, but when depression does come&#x2014;and it is bound to come in time&#x2014;we shall have an enormous amount of unemployment. The wage policy of the Government will, in some degree, tend to bring that about and to make it much more intense. I warn the farmers who support this legislation that they do have to pay the higher prices which inevitably follow the putting into force of these measures. They have to buy furniture, for instance, and they will have to pay considerably more for it than they did before. We shall have to pay more for goods manufactured here and for goods manufactured abroad. The man who is getting the biggest pull and is best off in South Africa is undoubtedly the skilled artisan; he is the highest paid artisan in the world, excepting Canada and the United States.</p>

<p>Were every member of the Opposition quite as frank in their utterances as the member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), then the workers of this country would know exactly where the South African party stand regarding the application of our industrial legislation. When the hon. member says: &#x201C;What right have you to drive a man out of his trade because he is prepared to work for less than other tradesmen&#x201D;&#x2014;well, that is getting at the very root of industrial organization.</p>

<p>Any man who refuses to join his trade union, but accepts all the benefits the organization is able to get for him, is like the man who went to a funeral, stole a wreath, and won a flower show prize with it. If the trade union movement, which members of the South African party contend they are in favour of, did not insist that every man was entitled to at least the minimum wage of the particular industry in which he works, what state of affairs would we have in this or any other country? The South African party should be given every credit for having introduced and passed the Conciliation Act of 1924. Machinery is provided in the Act whereby employers and employees can come together and hammer out their industrial difficulties and differences by the methods of reason, instead of, as was formerly the case, we had shooting first and investigation afterwards. That was the position until 1924, and it was largely owing to the recommendations embodied in the Brace Commission&#x2019;s report that the Industrial Conciliation Bill was drafted in 1923. But there was a mighty difference between the Bill that was introduced in 1923 and the Bill that ultimately became law in 1924. Some conception of the difference may be obtained from the report of the proceedings of the select committee of which I happened to be a member. In the original Bill the definition of &#x201C;trade union&#x201D; was: &#x201C;any combination of employees, whether temporary or permanent, for regulating relations between employers and employees, or between employees and employers, or for imposing restrictive conditions upon the conduct of any trade or business.&#x201D; Now, that is not a definition of a trade union at all. A trade union does not exist to impose any restrictive conditions on a business from which the members of that trade union derive their livelihood. It is exactly the reverse. The definition of &#x201C;trade union&#x201D; inserted in the revised Bill was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any number of persons associated together, either temporarily or permanently, for the purpose of regulating relations between themselves and their employers, or for protecting the interests of employees in any particular undertaking, industry, trade or occupation.</block>

<p>I mentioned this one instance to show the considerable difference between the Bill as originally introduced in 1923 and the Bill ultimately passed in 1924.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes (Mr. Sampson) and myself assisted in bringing about the first application in South Africa of the outstanding recommendations submitted to the British Government in 1917 by the Whitley Committee. The first industrial council in this country was established in 1919 for the printing industry of South Africa, and it was largely due to the experience the hon. member for Jeppes gained on that occasion that he was able to induce the select committee on the Industrial Conciliation Bill to adopt an almost entirely new measure, which the Minister of Mines and Industries of that day, to his credit be it said, accepted almost in its entirety. The original Bill only allowed for conciliation, but the revised measure provided for &#x201C;prevention and settlement of industrial disputes.&#x201D; There is no doubt the Conciliation Act is the finest piece of industrial legislation enacted since Union. But, as is only discovered in the application of every Act, there are a number of weaknesses in the otherwise excellent Industrial Conciliation Act. Section (2) of the Act is to be amended to the effect that, although a council may be dissolved, any agreement arrived at by the council shall continue until its natural expiry. Surely no reasonable-minded member of the House will object to any industrial agreement arrived at under the provisions of the Conciliation Act being observed by both sides right up to the time agreed upon. At present any one of the two parties not prepared to &#x201C;play the game&#x201D; can withdraw, and the agreement comes to an end. Surely that is not a fair proposition.</p>

This amendment is for the purpose of seeing that whatever agreement is arrived at will continue until the expiration of the period for which it was made. Surely that is fair and reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="col_2875-2876" refersTo="page_0032"/>Section (3), which previously provided that industrial councils should set out in their constitutions the method of procedure for dealing with disputes brought to their notice, thus leaving some doubt as to whether it was compulsory for a council to provide for the settlement of disputes, is now more definite in the amending Bill, and states that the council shall lay down procedure for dealing with all disputes within the undertaking, industry, occupation or trade concerned. That is, in my opinion, a very desirable amendment. Section (4) of the Act is to be amended to make it possible for any person (not necessarily employers or employees) to sit on a conciliation board. In evidence given before the select committee on the Conciliation Bill the representatives of the Cape Federation of Labour Unions advocated that others than those directly associated with any industry should be allowed to sit on a conciliation board appointed under the Act. They, however, agreed that it was desirable, in so far as a standing industrial council was concerned, that only employers and employees engaged in the industry should be members of the board. Mr. Stuart, the secretary of the Federation of Labour Unions in the Cape, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We would not confine the representatives on a conciliation board entirely to the workers and employees in the industry concerned. I would not agree to that because some time ago there was an industry which set up a wages board. We found in that industry no man suitable to put the case before the committee in the way in which we would like it to be done, and the result was that we had to get in an outsider. I do not think it would open the door in all cases to men other than those engaged in the industry, and it would not be wise to shut that door. I do not think it would be possible to have a plasterer called in to settle a dispute, say, in the printing industry. A little common sense is required. Outsiders often have to be called in in any new industry such as the leather industry, where I myself had to come along and settle their case. I get the facts from them and put the facts perhaps better than they could do it themselves.</block>

<p>I have no doubt Mr. Stuart is referring to the type of labour employed in the leather industry carried on, I understand, by our friend the member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). Not many of these men are altogether capable of putting up a proper case in support of better conditions, and it would be necessary for them, in the event of a special conciliation board being established, to get some assistance in order to present their case in a way that it could be understood and perhaps considered by the employers&#x2019; side. Mr. Stuart continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not necessarily appoint a secretary with a large knowledge of the industry. Take the case of the tramways. The tramway employees instructed that I should represent them and would have nobody else. I was able to represent them, although I am not a tramwayman.</block>

<p>(That was in the case of a dispute in Cape Town between the tramwaymen&#x2019;s union and the tramway company, and the former requested the secretary of the federation to represent them on the special board set up to try and bring about a settlement.) Mr. Richens, who, I understand, is secretary of one of the industrial unions in Cape Town, said on the same subject&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We agree that only a member of the national organization should be represented on the standing board, but in the case of the smaller unions, who have no man to put a case for them, they can ask an outsider to put the case on their behalf. That, however, is only in the case of a special conciliation board.</block>

<p>Mr. Stuart added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are often cases where a manager does not know everything about a particular industry, and if he is allowed to take part there is no reason why I should not be allowed to take part in any negotiations as secretary.</block>

<p>I submit that it is only reasonable that an amendment of this kind should be agreed to, in order that any person, whom the employers or the employees have sufficient confidence in, should be permitted to act for them on a special conciliation board. There is the deletion in Clause 4 of sub-section (1), making it possible for a conciliation board to be formed by the Minister in respect of a grievance brought forward by any individual employee or employer. That was a point we fought very strenuously indeed on the select committee in 1923, because, after all is said and done, most of the disputes arise out of a one-man issue, and, of course, under the principal Act as it stands no conciliation boards can be appointed in such circumstances.</p>

<p>Why should men who are altogether in favour of settling these differences by the methods of reason be compelled to strike? That is what it means. Because the Minister cannot provide for the setting up of a special conciliation board on a question of a one man issue. This amendment should also be accepted by the House. I am given to understand that officials who are at present inspecting wage agreements find on many occasions that the rate of wages either laid down by a determination of the Wage Board or come to by an agreement under the Industrial Conciliation Act, <span class="col_2877-2878" refersTo="page_0033"/>is not paid, and many of the employees, regrettable as it is to have to say so, actually assist the employer in contravening the terms of the wage determination or the industrial agreement by accepting less pay, and at the same time signing the book that they are receiving amounts in accordance with the agreement. Employers who came before the Industrial Conciliation Select Committee objected to this unfair competition whereby an unscrupulous employer can come to an understanding with his workmen to sign for a certain amount and then accept less than what is shown in the wage book. Surely it should not be necessary for an employee, who may proceed against an employer for a contravention of the Act, to have to go to the civil courts to get the money to which he is entitled. Provision is therefore made that the magistrate who originally tries the case can also give judgment that the full amount to which the workman is entitled will be paid by the employer. Again I submit that is a fair and reasonable amendment, and should be accepted by the House.</p>

During the committee stage of the Industrial Conciliation Bill in 1923, tile hon. member for Jeppe (Mr. Sampson) moved an additional new clause as follows: &#x201C;Any employer who stipulates, as a condition of employment, that any person should not be a member of a trade union, or of any particular trade union, shall be guilty of an offence,&#x201D; but every member of the South African party in the House, to the number of 53, voted against.</p>

<p>I think the House must have noticed with great interest the statement made by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) (Mr. Strachan) that his colleagues on the other side were beginning to see more light. I think that they are beginning to feel a little more the cold draught that is flowing down in political circles, and that they would have liked to hear from the hon. member something of a little warmth in their existing political situation. Before I come to deal with one or two points in the Bill, I would like to say that the hon. member hardly rendered fairly what was said by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) with respect to those men who secure employment at the rate at which they were prepared to work. As I understood the hon. member for Cape Town (Central), he was dealing entirely with the semi-skilled man, who, under the hard and fast agreement which the Minister had made, have not been provided for, and are suffering severely because of the failure of the Minister to ensure that there may be some degree of grading and some sort of provision made for them.</p>

<p>That was the position in South Africa, that there are so many men who are not sufficiently trained, and not able to earn the wages in that particular trade. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) spoke of this proposed amendment which had been moved in 1924, and referred to the fact that members of the South African party voted against it, but they did so for the reason, as I have read from the proceedings, that it formed no part whatever of the provisions to deal with industrial conciliation. The proper course was to introduce a Bill and deal with it there. I would like to support the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) when he asked the Minister to agree to this Bill being sent to a select committee, and I believe, after having listened with care to what was said by the Minister and his friends, we as a House and country, cannot feel that sufficient information has been put before the House to justify the amendment. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) said, in effect, what I have heard elsewhere&#x2014;&#x201C;the great industrial charter&#x201D;. It should be called the Malan Industrial Charter, because it was introduced by the previous Minister of Mines and Industries. I do not think it is quite to the credit of the hon. member to say that, had it not been for the majority they had, it would not have been put through. Let us at least give credit where credit is due. If the Minister is so satisfied that this is one of the most satisfactory pieces of industrial legislation in the whole of South Africa, and as I have heard hon. members remark, and anywhere else, any interference with that should be done with the greatest caution. We cannot afford to make a mistake. At this moment the House has nothing more before it than the exceedingly sketchy speech with which the Bill was introduced by the Minister, who did not do justice to the importance of this question, but has left us very much in the dark. We look to him, as being very closely in touch with this Act, to tell us something of its practical application and of the complaints which he has received from the side of the employers and from the side of the employees. But he was silent on that point.</p>

<p>Yes, if they so desire. Such an agreement might be applied to persons who stand outside. I would like to ask the Minister what is the necessity for this alteration. What administrative difficulty has prompted this? Has it anything to do with any request made to him by employers whereby they can compel other employers to join some other organization against their will, or is the reason because of any endeavour of any trade union to use this machinery to compel men to belong to any union? As a matter of fact, I think he will know from his experience that that question has arisen, and the point has been put whether in certain agreements which have received the force of law, it is competent to include in them words which look very much like compulsory trade unionism. If that is the purpose of this amendment the Minister should have told the House so when he introduced the Bill. I hope the House will carefully look at it from this point of view, because it is possible you may have an element of coercion introduced which may be applied by the employers as well as by the employees. Perhaps the only reason for this amendment is to enable an industrial council to lay it down that all persons engaged in the particular industry concerned shall belong to a particular body. I am not concerned with whether that is a good or a bad plan, but it is quite foreign to the principle of conciliation, and if you thus divert the purpose and scope of the principal Act you do infinite harm to the great cause which underlies it. I come to the proposal to overcome the position in the case of the commercial employers versus the commercial employees. I am glad the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) (Mr. Strachan) is in the House, for an exceedingly interesting affidavit was made by him and by the hon. <span class="col_2881-2882" refersTo="page_0035"/>member for Jeppes (Mr. Sampson) explaining what exactly Parliament meant when it passed that particular section, but that affidavit did not seem to be of much assistance to the court.

<speech by="#coulter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, but it does not quite fit in with the many-sided occupations of a member of Parliament. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) argued that he could not see why an outsider should not sit upon an industrial council. Why did he insist upon that? Because he knows perfectly well that you cannot get from an outsider that familiarity with the conditions of the trade that you can obtain from a person actually engaged in the trade. In addition to that, the persons engaged in that trade, whether on the employer&#x2019;s side with his capital or on the employee&#x2019;s side with his chances of employment, in all the arguments and disputes that may take place, have behind them this fact&#x2014;that they have at stake their employment or their capital, and thus two men whose interests are so vitally affected are more likely to come to an amicable agreement than are any (other persons. It seems to me that the whole evidence shows that if you let in a professional negotiator&#x2014; what in America is called a &#x201C;roarer&#x201D;&#x2014;I will not call him an agitator, because that might hurt the feelings of some people not here, the chances of an agreement being arrived at are considerably reduced. Is it likely that when men are called in to fight for any particular point of view that does not directly concern them that you are going to arrive at an agreement? If the Minister&#x2019;s proposal to amend Clause 2 is carried so as to delete the proviso in sub-section (1), you may have a dispute as to whether the services of a particular man are to be terminated. If one man can demand a conciliation board he will say that he wants the man who will agree to nothing, for as long as no agreement is arrived at, he will remain in his job. It is most important that members of a conciliation board should be men who have something at stake, and not merely be men who receive so much for sitting on the board. It has not been shown that it is impossible to find men able to do this. Take a local case where the Commercial Employees&#x2019; Association desired to nominate Mr. X. Will anybody tell me that that association could not find in Cape Town one of its members able to do just as good work for it as Mr. X? I could nominate a man who could do as much as Mr. X could do.</p>

<p>You are penalizing the good employer because of the bad employer. We know from the report of the Mining Industries Board that this very question of submitting the rights and the position of individual employees to conciliation boards was in vogue in the Transvaal for a number of years. Unfortunately, the Minister is not able to draw lessons from history. The board was a very competent and independent one. I need not say it was a very competent board, though I understand the hon. member for Germiston (Mr. Brown) was sitting on it. The board came to the conclusion that the practices that had prevailed were such as wholly to undermine discipline. This is the point I am urging. There is the report of that commission which definitely condemns the system that then existed, so that we start off in considering this proposed amendment by knowing that this board came to the conclusion that in any industry and particularly in the mining industry it was impossible to maintain efficiency and discipline if you were going to have conciliation boards constantly interfering with the management in the legitimate exercise of its duties as such. The onus will be heavily on the Minister to show us why this alteration should be made. What did he tell us in support of it? To the best of my recollection, he said he had been asked by the employers to bring about a repeal of this proviso. We do not know who has asked or under what circumstances.</p>

They said as they have said to-day that the heavens would fall if this proviso appeared in the Bill of 1924. I have an extract from a speech made by the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston), and I am going to read from page 156 of &#x201C;Hansard,&#x201D; a characteristic speech that he made which must seriously have troubled the House at the time, because of the prediction of the terrible wrong that would result from this particular clause.

<p>I certainly did not understand that, but I, of course, accept what the hon. member says. I will confine myself to the prediction that there would be a tremendous number of disputes.

Where has there been a single dispute? Where have there been disputes which this proviso has prevented from being dealt with in a proper way?

If he has this information, I ask him to give us the opportunity of learning from his departmental officials and from himself if need be what is the particular point at which the shoe pinches, and then we will be in a position to say whether he is right or wrong. I am not prepared to say that the mere ipse dixit of the Minister on the point is sufficient for introducing this remarkable provision. It seems clear that in any industry, because the Act applies to every industry except farming, where an employer proposes to promote an employee or to terminate the services of an employee, the conciliation board can be demanded. He might desire to promote an employee and other employees might think the promotion unjustified, and a conciliation board could be demanded.</p>

<p>The Minister may not have been taken before the court, but if &#x201C;may&#x201D; is construed to mean &#x201C;shall&#x201D; as it often has been construed, you will find the Minister has no discretion, and in a case like that, where there is a dispute as to whether A or B shall be promoted, the Minister will be bound to grant a conciliation board, and away entirely goes the whole system of discipline in that industry. Should industry in South Africa be subject to the single undivided act of discretion on the part of the Minister? How is industry to be carried on if the Minister is the one who is going to determine whether perhaps the whole of the organization of a particular employer shall be thrown out of gear, because a demand is made undermining the whole of the discipline of that particular industry?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me consider that point. I am surprised that the Minister is prepared to take so great a responsibility. He rushes in where everyone else perhaps fears to tread. Even suppose he has enough courage to do so, I ask is it fair that any large industry, whether it be the bootmaking industry or any other industry, should have to feel, when it is considering a question of discipline, that the grant of a conciliation board will depend on whether or not a particular employee, or some particular trade union, has or has not got the ear of the Minister.</p>

<p>The Minister is not infallible. He might be partial. I am not speaking of him personally; I am speaking possibly of his successor. He may not have proper information. I would like to know under what conditions the Minister proposes to deal with applications for a conciliation board like this. Let me picture a particular case: &#x201C;A&#x201D; thinks that he has been unjustifiably derated, and he goes with a resolution and gets the ear of the Minister.</p>

<p>That is a big difference to the man coming to me and demanding a board.</p>

<speech by="#coulter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>If that man comes with two of his fellow workmen. After all, do not let us get into a quibble about it. While the Minister is trying to escape from reading into the section the fact that a few people like that or one man who might come there with a resolution behind him from, let us say, a dud committee, and have the ear of the Minister, does he refuse to allow the employers to have the same facility, or is he going to issue a mere fiat, and say there is to be a conciliation board? I have raised these points, not only to hear from the Minister what he is going to say in order that the country may know generally the effect of this amendment, but because I feel that there is a necessity that these matters should be inquired into by a select committee. Let me tell him that in 1923 and 1924, when the framework of this Bill was under consideration, there was no refusal to give hon. members on my left an opportunity of stating their views. Now that the positions are reversed, and we find the Minister adamantine in his refusal to let these things be placed before a committee, can he really assure the House that the views of employers and the views of employees are sufficiently known to us in considering this particular proviso? I notice that in 1924, when this proposal was before the House, the federation of employers in the building industry sent a very important resolution to the House in which they protested against the inclusion of that particular section. Has that industry changed its mind? Has it communicated with the Minister? I shall be glad to know what the true position is.</p>

<p>Have they got to administer the Act? Do they do it or do I?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coulter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, unfortunately, as it may prove for the country, the Minister has to administer it. By contemptuously putting aside suggestions that are made to him he is not serving the interests of the country. When I draw his attention to an important resolution like that, for him to reply in that way shows that the Minister, at the moment, is suffering from a misconception of the true duties of a Minister of Labour. I would like to ask him to give us some information in regard to another matter. The hon. member for Jeppes (Mr. Sampson) made a very interesting speech the other day, and there was a little exchange between him and the Minister relating to something I cannot quite follow. The Minister was speaking of a permission he might give to native workmen to manufacture their own products in their own native locations or within their own territories, subject to the condition that those products should not be sold outside those areas. This is economic segregation with a vengeance. This is industrial segregation, and I put the question to the Minister across the floor of the House whether he was referring to native territories and whether he was, perhaps, taking the long view following upon something the hon. member for Liesbeek (Mr. Pearce) once advocated, that is, a restriction on the right to sell products which might be produced under particular conditions of labour. In this particular case the Minister gave that assurance to the hon. member for Jeppes. What did he mean?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Read the clause. It speaks for itself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coulter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I would like the Minister to explain to the House. I want to know this&#x2014;is the Minister contemplating some scheme whereby he proposes that, if the natives in the country establish an industry, and to illustrate it more clearly, shall I say in the native territories, that he is to ring round that area with some restriction so as to prevent their products from having a free market in the Union. Is that what he means? I am putting the question to him, and I hope he will be good enough to give us a full and clear reply on the point. From time to time one notices in the &#x201C;Gazette&#x201D; publications and determinations by the Minister, determinations reflecting agreements arrived at by industrial councils, that is, by employers on the one side and employees on the other side. I would like to ask the Minister what regard he pays to the interests of the consumers when agreements of that kind are submitted to him. Does he institute any enquiries as to how the consumers can bear the increased burden which may be involved in this agreement, or does he simply put his signature upon it and give it the force of law? The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) referred to the great increase in cost to the consumer as a result of the promulgation of some of these agreements. I am quite prepared to believe that the agreement has meant increased profits. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Some of the amendments which have been introduced into this Bill are very far-reaching, and I am afraid that the Minister, when making his second reading speech, did not clearly explain the purport and effect of some of the amendments. I think that possibly hon. members sitting on the opposite <span class="col_2887-2888" refersTo="page_0038"/>benches have not a full grip and realization what the effect of some of the amendments may be. The first amendment with which I wish to deal is the one which amends the whole foundation on which the Conciliation Act was originally based, was the establishment of a spirit of goodwill and of co-operation between the employers and the employees. It set up machinery by which employers and an equal number of employees would deal with any disputes which arose in that particular industry. Provision was made in the Bill for only the employers and employees of that particular industry to sit on the conciliation board, but it is now proposed to alter that and allow any outsider to sit on such a board. I think this is a great mistake. I would like to ask the Minister whether he can give any cases where hardships have occurred where an industrial council has been hampered by not allowing an outsider to be appointed on that particular council. It seems to me, if you allow an outsider to come in, it is going to have the effect that, instead of creating a spirit of conciliation, it is going to create a spirit of antagonism, and it gives an opportunity to the professional negotiator to sit on the boards in which he has no direct interest whatever. It is only fair and reasonable that on all these conciliation boards there should be men who are particularly interested in the industry and that settlement of all disputes should be left in their hands. Antagonism is going to be created by the man who is going to be introduced from outside. Surely the Minister should have left well alone. There is another point with which I want to deal, and that is the amendment in the definition of the word &#x201C;employee&#x201D;; in other words, by now including pass-bearing natives and Indian immigrants in this definition. Does the Minister realize what the effect of this is going to be upon the country generally? Does he realize that it will give an opening to I.C.U. organizers? The Minister may smile, but we in Natal realize that once the Minister includes the pass-bearing native he is going to cause a considerable amount of perturbation. Mr. van Niekerk, who is a member of the Native Affairs Commission, and is also a farmer, reports that the native has not yet reached that state of civilization when he should he brought under the purview of the Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>I know, but is that not the thin edge of the wedge? It is the beginning. I look upon this as very dangerous legislation, and it is difficult to say what the effect will be. An agitation is going on throughout the country which is having a very detrimental effect; many of us are suffering very severely from that agitation. There is another point. Do hon. members opposite realize that once you bring natives within the purview of the Act you whittle down the powers under the Masters and Servants Act? Will it be possible to prosecute under that Act a native who has gone on strike?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I am told yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>I submit that the Minister is wrong. I submit that if a native goes on strike in an industry in which a determination has been made, his employer will not be able to prosecute him under the Masters and Servants Act. A material alteration has been made in the definition of strike. In the original Act the definition was suspension or temporary cessation of work by any number of employees, but under the new definition the Minister uses the word &#x201C;persons&#x201D;, I have taken legal advice and I am told that if natives are brought within the definition of the word &#x201C;employees&#x201D; it will not be possible to prosecute them under the Masters and Servants Act. If that is so, it is very serious, for if there is one thing we on the platteland must fight against, it is the whittling down of the Masters and Servants Act. It is the only means we have of controlling natives. This proposal originated with the Economic Commission, Section 31 of whose report stated. [Extract read.] I submit that this is the first step to the carrying out of the minority report of the Economic Commission. You will not be able to prosecute any natives who strike.</p>

<p>If I am right, hon. members on the other side must realize that the time is not very far off when an agitation will start to do away with the Masters and Servants Act on the platteland. If the effect of the clause is as stated there it will not be very Jong before a powerful agitation will follow to repeal the Masters and Servants Act altogether. Legislation of this sort is playing directly into the hands of the I.C.U. One has only to read the speech made by Mr. Kadalie last week in Newcastle. I might incidentally say that Mr. Kadalie referred, in derogatory terms, to Mr. Marwick, Gen. Hertzog and Mr. Nel, saying that the best thing that could happen was that they should be deported from the country. He went further, and in referring to the I.C.U., said: &#x201C;We are making the farmers tremble. The workers in Natal are going to kick up such a row that the farmers in Natal will not be able to sleep&#x201D;. It would lead to no good purpose to mention all Kadalie said in his heated speech.</p>
