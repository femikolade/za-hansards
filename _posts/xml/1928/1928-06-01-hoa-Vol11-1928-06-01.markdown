<heading>ORAL QUESTION. DISTURBANCES IN CAPE TOWN ON UNION DAY.</heading>

<speech by="#oost">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OOST</person>,</from>

<p>with leave, asked the Prime Minister:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he will cause a departmental enquiry to be held into the immediate cause of the disturbances which occurred in Cape Town yesterday;</li>

<li>(2) whether he will have the instigators of the disturbances traced and handed over to the judicial authorities;</li>

<li>(3) whether he is aware that the police, according to instruction, was prevented from taking effective action until fairly late in the afternoon, owing to which the state of serious unrest was considerably prolonged; and</li>

<li>(4) whether he will investigate why the police was ordered only late in the afternoon to use the necessary force ?</li>

</ol>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) I am not sufficiently acquainted with what happened to be able to give a definite reply to this question, but I hope that if circumstances justify such an enquiry, the matter will be brought to the notice of the Minister concerned and his department.</li>

<li>(2) It is the duty of the police to see to criminals being sought for and punished, and I must assume that this will also be done in this instance.</li>

<li>(3) No. I know nothing of such instructions, and if such instructions were given, I must naturally presume that there were good reasons therefor.</li>

<li>(4) If any negligence or ill-will is alleged, then it would be the duty of the Minister of Justice to order an enquiry.</li>

</ol>

<p>May I ask a supplementary question?</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not think this can be discussed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gilson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GILSON</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to ask a question. I don&#x2019;t want to discuss it. Arising out of that question, I would like to ask the Prime Minister, if he does not think that the cause of the disturbance was the refusal of the Government to fly both flags from the Castle at Cape Town.</p>
