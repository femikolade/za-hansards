<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>The Bill is so thoroughly bad and so based on ignorance and prejudice that I feel it is wrong that it should be passed without some final protest. In the discussion some of my hon. friends on the Government side complained that the racial issue had been introduced. No one regrets that more than I do, but the blame for that is entirely on the shoulders of the Government, because it is not possible for anyone reasonable to examine this Bill and avoid the conclusion that it is aimed at a particular race, and if any evidence of that were necessary, apart from the implications and details of the Bill, it is to be found in the statement made by the Minister of the Interior, who, speaking on this very question, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Government could not go further than the sentiments of the people allowed &#x2026;. There was very little anti-Semitism in South Africa to-day, and all sections desired to give the Jewish people full equality in every respect. South Africa could to-day still appreciate very highly what the Jews had done for South Africa &#x2026;. but if this were continued this stream of immigration from Eastern Europe must stop. Already with this indiscriminate influx they saw a nervousness arising among all sections of the people, and if they did not take immediate steps, that nervousness might develop into active hostility.</block>

<p>I submit a statement of that kind is the strongest possible evidence that can be produced in so far as the Government and the Minister are concerned, that they aim at a certain section of the South African community. If that were not enough, we had the statement of the Prime Minister who, in replying to the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts), said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They were not prepared to see the door left open to an element that might lead to the disruption of the South African nation. Already there were four great classes: The native, the Indian, the coloured man, and the European, standing distinct and separate from one another as separate national entities, and they felt, if this immigration were permitted as at present, then as surely as the Indian came here to form a new national group, they would have a fifth national group.</block>

<p>One is constrained to ask what possible meaning is to be applied to this, because it can be applied to no other community than the one to which I have the honour to belong. Hon. members on the other side have been complaining of some of my references to their attitude towards the sanctity of family life. These references were made more in sorrow than in anger, and that contempt was aroused, not so much by the attitude of the Minister and his friends who sit behind him, as by the actual details of the Bill, which showed that no consideration was given to the sanctity of family life. The Minister himself, when I proposed that some amendment should be made, as a result of which that family life could be maintained, and those who were domiciled in South Africa would have the right to bring their wives and children, admitted that if this amendment was accepted, the whole value of the Bill would be upset. As far as the Minister is concerned, and the party which sits behind him, I take it, surely they are more concerned with the question of restricting immigration than the sanctity of family life. I was justified then, and I am justified now in referring somewhat contemptuously to the attitude of the Minister and his party towards the sanctity of family life&#x2014;the vindictive and unchristian spirit which has actuated the Minister.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>I submit, in attributing vindictiveness, or an unchristian spirit to anyone, I am not going contrary to the rules of the House. While the discussion was going on, I read, with great pleasure and admiration, <span class="col_1355-1356" refersTo="page_0748"/>the very beautiful principle enunciated by the Minister&#x2014;who is very good at enunciating principles, although the application thereof is a different thing&#x2014;who speaking in another part of this city said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The test of the Christian spirit is not hidebound orthodoxy. A church may be ever so strait-laced as far as doctrine is concerned, and yet not be entitled to consider itself Christian in the fullest sense of the word. Its members may let &#x201C;Lord, Lord&#x201D; resound from every nook and corner, but unless it is inspired by human charity and loving-kindness, unless it means something to the world at large&#x2014;its Master would most likely say to it, &#x201C;I have never known thee.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I have looked in vain for human charily and loving-kindness in this Bill and in the Minister&#x2019;s attitude, and applying the Minister&#x2019;s own test one is constrained to believe that his Master will also say to him: &#x201C;I have never known thee.&#x201D; I want to deal with another aspect, and that is the illogical nature of the Bill, and the ignorance underlying it. One of the points raised by the Minister in support of the Bill is that we must safeguard western civilization in South Africa. The Minister seems to have forgotten that western civilization is based on two great factors&#x2014;the culture of the Greeks and the ethics of the Jews&#x2014;and here we have a Bill which seeks to exclude the two peoples who are responsible for the development of western civilization. It is assumed that the great thing to do is to allow Nordic people to come into the country, and yet we have the people of Finland excluded, and the people who come from Lithuania, also Nordic, excluded. We have the peculiar position that people who, prior to the war, formed a part of the German empire, are now to be excluded from South Africa. Large portions of Germany which but for the war would still have belonged to the German empire, now belong to Poland, and because they now belong to Poland the people of that part of Europe are to be excluded. We have the case of Czechoslovakia, formerly part of the Austrian empire, and yet the Minister to-day excludes Czechoslovakians from entering South Africa. He allows people to come here from Italy and France. I have no objection to them, but on the one hand we have the people of Italy and France allowed to come in, and on the other hand we have the people of Roumania, of similar race origin, excluded. The Bill is very illogical. We have the peculiar circumstance that while some of these people to whom I have referred are not allowed to come into South Africa, the Senegalese, the Malagese and the people of Algeria, races which would otherwise be excluded, are allowed to come in by reason of the fact that they belong to France, and are French citizens. I want to take another point in connection with this matter. The Minister gave us many platitudes about the trend of immigration to-day from various parts of the world to other parts of the world, but if he had examined the immigration now taking place, he would have seen that the greatest force which brings about that immigration is not economic or racial, so much as the fact that people tend to go to a certain country because their relatives and friends are there. That is what has influenced immigration to the United States to a large extent of recent years. The people who are largely hit by this Bill are the people whose relatives and friends have come here. Now they are to be stopped from coming to South Africa. The Minister, in attempting to stop them, has made various statements, and one of his statements in particular deserves attention. Dealing with this immigration from Eastern Europe, he said that the census disclosed that of these who came from that part 22 per cent. were dependents&#x2014; that is women and children&#x2014;to whom he did not object, less than 3 per cent. were agricultural, and no less than 80 per cent. belonged to other occupations in following which they must subsist on what others produced. The Minister could not possibly have investigated those figures when he submitted them. I have an analysis of the immigration from Lithuania, Poland and Latvia into the Union of South Africa for the seven months ending 31st December, 1929. During those seven months 1,664 immigrants landed in South Africa from those countries, and of these 749 were women and children. Of the 915 males 436 were actually producers, and of the balance of 479, 91 are students, doctors, artists, musicians, teachers and clergy; leaving 388 who are made up of jewellers, butchers, travellers, clerks, salesmen and general dealers. I have all the details. Take, for instance, joiners and carpenters 48; farmers 22; electricians 14; locksmiths 12; upholsterers 13; mechanics 14; watchmakers 45; and so you may go through the figures, and find that there are 436 of these people who are useful producers helping in the development of South Africa. I have given one or two of these details to show how ill-informed the Minister is, and how he has framed this Bill on unreliable and inaccurate information. I want to take another point in connection with this matter. We are faced, in South Africa, with the peculiar position of a very large disparity between the white and native races. I remember that since 1921 a statement which was made by Mr. Cousins, then Director of Census, has been mainly relied upon by the Government to justify their native policy. In 1921 Mr. Cousins said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will require very little calculation to show that if the white race is to hold its own in South Africa, it will be necessary to secure an immense development of white civilization during the next fifty years, or perhaps, only the next twenty-five years. The European race can only hold its own numerically by seeking accessions from abroad.</block>

<p>Yet the Government has now shut the door on white immigration. That is bad not only from the economic point of view but from the national point of view. From the economic <span class="col_1357-1358" refersTo="page_0749"/>point of view it is bound to retard the economic progress of South Africa, as I have already indicated by figures in the debate on the second reading; and from the national point of view, as a result of this policy very little will be done to break down the disparity between European and native races referred to by the Director of Census. I am justified in saying by this Bill you are virtually closing the doors, because by the figures we have it is clear that a very large percentage of the immigration hitherto flowing in has been also flowing out again. More and more of the English-speaking people are leaving South Africa; and I pause to ask the hon. Minister and my friends on the other side of the House, what are we doing&#x003F; On the one hand the enforcement of bilingualism is being urged; on the other hand we have a regulation by which an English speaking person coming to this country from overseas cannot enter the railway service for a period of two years. Further, the general commercial policy embarked on by the Government is bound to discourage immigration. The policy of which the present Bill is the culminating point is a policy of prohibiting immigration. On the one hand western civilization, about which we are hearing so much, is to be excluded. On the other hand commerce is being discouraged by the policy of the Government, and now a measure which is about to be forced upon this House by the Minister will barricade the windows of South Africa to learning from overseas. This policy is leading South Africa in the wrong direction; that of narrow nationalism and little Africanderism. The policy I have advocated would lead to greater progress and development. I want to protest on these grounds against this Bill.</p>

<p>When people in general are prejudiced against an issue, the soundest arguments fail to induce them to reconsider their attitude. Whilst the hon. Prime Minister is in his seat, and fearing he may run away&#x2014; speaking recently in Johannesburg at a dinner given to Dr. Brainen he is reported to have said that the Jews are &#x201C;Fine citizens, and an asset to any nation&#x201D;. I ask the Prime Minister did he mean that or not&#x003F; The present Bill is nothing less than a miserable piece of legislation against which we should strongly protest. I believe the hon. Prime Minister must have meant what he said. Why, then, this attempt to keep out a certain section of the population&#x003F; I have challenged the Prime Minister on many occasions to say whether he did or did not mean what he is reported to have said, yet there he sits mute and dumb. As for his adjutant who introduced this Bill I ask him what was meant by that statement&#x003F; But not a word is said. I am horrified to find we have men in South Africa who will make public pronouncements and then decline to say what they meant. I contend most strongly the Government has all the powers necessary for the effective control of immigration by means of the 1913 Act. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan), when he held the post of Minister of the Interior, gradually reduced immigration, not on the ground of race but on the ground of occupation. This was justifiable. But when the present Minister came into office, what did he do&#x003F; He opened the flood gates. Why did he first of all open the flood gates, and why does he now suddenly seek to close them again&#x003F; I have asked the Minister to reflect and with draw the Bill; the time will surely come when it will recoil upon him, and he will say &#x201C;What a pity I did not listen to the hon. member for Von Brandis&#x201D; (Mr. Nathan).</p>

<p>[Debate, adjourned on 28th February, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#hofmeyr">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOFMEYR</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate on this subject was adjourned last Friday I was trying to draw the attention of the House to the importance of the matter we were dealing with. This is a private Bill, and that fact brings with it a certain advantage, because it enables hon. members to regard the matter without party feeling, and extraneous considerations. It has, however, its disadvantage because it possibly causes hon. members to lose sight of the importance of the Bill, and the public outside also do. We are concerned with an important matter. The creation of a new national university is a matter of great importance to any nation. The character of the nation is to a very great extent what it is made by the universities of that nation. The university is the protector of the traditions, the past, and also the future welfare of the nation. Up to a certain point it is also the university that guards the conscience of the nation. Therefore, however favourably disposed the House may be towards the Transvaal University College and its aspirations to a higher status it is still necessary for us to very fully consider the matter from all aspects. We are asked what the effect of this proposal will be. In a few words it is the creation of another university, the fifth in South Africa, and we shall then at once hear the criticism which we have had to listen to so often&#x2014;&#x201C;another university&#x201D;! Have we not enough universities&#x003F; We often hear this question. With regard to it, I should like to associate myself with what the hon. member for Brits (Dr. H. Reitz) has said. The passing of this Bill will make no difference in that respect. The important point is this; will it involve an increase in the number of university institutions we have in the country&#x003F; At present we have three universities and a federal university which consists of six university colleges. As a result of the acceptance of this Bill we shall have four universities and a federal university, which will then consist of four university colleges. The number of institutions therefore remains unchanged. It may possibly be said that there are too many university institutions in the country, and much could be said in support of that. There is, however, another side to the matter, and it comes to the front when we ask the question which of the institutions we would like to eliminate&#x003F; Everybody knows that the existence of a university institution, at any rate in its own circle, does good work, and even indispensable work. However attractive the ideal may possibly be of a single university for the whole country, we must still admit that South Africa is rather richer than poorer because at the time three instead of two universities were established. We must also admit that South Africa rather was enriched than inpoverished when the University of the Witwatersrand separated. The country is so much the richer that in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, and in Bloemfontein in the Free State, and in Grahamstown in the Eastern Province there are university colleges. Therefore, I cannot now identify myself with that line of criticism. But there is another line of criticism which should be followed. There are certain objections which must be mentioned. I do not do so to wreck the Bill, but to find a way by which those objections can be removed, and I hope that a way will be found as a result of the debate of this measure, of the statement by the Minister, or as a result of the passing of an amendment by the House to one clause in the Bill. I spoke of criticism. Now there are Hon. members in the House who know that I am connected with the University of the Witwatersrand. The hon. member for Brits specially appealed to hon. members who were interested in that university. He did so and I do not want to create the impression in making the criticism I do, it is because I take an interest in the Witwatersrand University. In the past the relations between the two institutions were not always friendly. Opposition came from the Transvaal University College to the development of the Witwatersrand University College into a university, but fortunately those days are long since past, fortunately the relations to-day are of the most friendly <span class="col_1361-1362" refersTo="page_0751"/>kind. The best possible spirit exists between the two institutions. The Witwatersrand University notices with the greatest satisfaction the development of the Transvaal University College, and when that college asks for the higher status of a university the University of the Witwatersrand, apart from general views in connection with the university development of the country, will make no objection to such a proposal. The interests of the Witwatersrand University are not affected by this Bill. It will have no effect upon the number of students. But even if it had that effect we would still be ready to look the facts in the face, if we could maintain and preserve the good relations between the two institutions. The Witwatersrand University therefore makes absolutely no objection to this Bill, and if the Transvaal University College achieves its object, then the University of the Witwatersrand will be the first to wish Pretoria success and prosperity. That also is the spirit in which the matter is regarded by the town of Johannesburg, and by the part that I represent in the House. The town of Johannesburg is in this connection favourably disposed towards the town of Pretoria. This possibly was not always so in the past. I remember the mayoral polemics between the two mayors about university questions in which the hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Mr. Giovanetti), as mayor of Pretoria, took part. Those days, however, are past. The town of Johannesburg has attained its ideal in university questions, and will place no stumbling block in the way of the fulfilment of a similar ideal in the case of the sister town, Pretoria. When, therefore, I have to make certain criticisms on the Bill, I do not speak on behalf of the Witwatersrand University, nor as representative of the town of Johannesburg, but as a member of this House who, like all members I think, takes an interest in the healthy development of university life in South Africa, and who feels that the importance of the creation of a university demands that we should consider the proposal from all sides. There are two points to which I want to draw the attention of the House in connection with this matter. Firstly, it is necessary to put the question what the effect of the Bill will be on the University of South Africa, and on future university development in our country. The University of South Africa consists of six constituent colleges; from the nature of the case it is wrong to regard that university as a permanent institution. In the select committee the University of South Africa was described as the children&#x2019;s nurse, the &#x201C;wet nurse&#x201D; of the constituent colleges. That possibly goes a little far, but if we look at the Act on the University of South Africa we can, at any rate, compare the university with a parental home in which the daughters are still living without its being the intention that they should always continue to live there. In such a case it is necessary for us, when the most important of the constituent colleges wants to leave the home, to ask what the effect will be. When in 1920 the University of the Witwatersrand, which at that time was also a college in the University of South Africa, made an effort in the same direction, the Minister, at the time, specially left this question to the council of the University of South Africa, and he tried to get the opinion of the Senate of the University of South Africa. In this case that procedure has not been followed, because the last meeting of the Senate was in September last, and the movement for the university was only started in October. The next meeting of the Senate will probably take place in April, so there has not yet been an opportunity for the Senate to state its views on the matter. But perhaps it is of interest to see what statement was made by the Senate of the University of South Africa in 1920 with reference to the scheme of the University College of Johannesburg in the same direction. The statement was that the secession from the University of South Africa will have the tendency to disorganize the University of South Africa, and would weaken the staff, and the Senate also thought that in consequence of the geographical position the secession of the Johannesburg University College would lead to serious administrative difficulties. The view of the Senate on the University of South Africa held in 1920 was, to a great extent, contradicted by the occurrences of subsequent years. It was in the first place, due to that that instead of the Johannesburg University College another college was introduced, viz., that of Potchefstroom, but in the second place, in 1921 and subsequent years the number of students in South Africa increased very much. Those were years during which the number of university students rapidly increased, and as a result the University of South Africa overtook in a few years what it had lost as a result of the separation of the Johannesburg University Cellege. To-day, however, the separation of the T.U.C. will undoubtedly have far more serious results. Circumstances in university matters are not to-day the ease as in 1920-&#x2019;21. The number of students in our colleges and universities are in the main stabilized. We cannot expect any large increase in the number of students during the next few years, and therefore the separation of the T.U.C. will administer a heavy blow to the University of South Africa. I shall certainly not go so far as to say that the latter university is not strong enough to-day to stand the blow, but I want to correlate the fact with what I consider as a further effect which the passing of this Bill will have. It is that it will open the way for secession of still more of the constituent colleges of the University of South Africa, and the establishment of still more universities. If we examine the figures given in the supplement to the report of the select committee we find that the Rhodes University College, e.g., does not come far behind the T.U.C. to-day. The Transvaal University College has, in fact, more faculties, but the number of faculties are, in my opinion, of very little importance in the establishment of universities, and financially the Rhodes University College is probably stronger than the T.U.C. There are, indeed, fewer students at the <span class="col_1363-1364" refersTo="page_0752"/>former, but when you remember that a very large number of the students at the T.U.C. are not full-time students, but external students, who only pass a part of their time there, then we find that even to-day the difference between the two institutions is not too great, and I think we can certainly assume that if the Bill passes we shall very soon commence to hear of a movement in favour of the establishment of a university in the Eastern Province, as well as another movement for the establishment of a university in Natal. We are already beginning to hear of this movement. Recently attempts have been made and with success to start university work in Durban. I understand fairly large amounts have been subscribed there in support of university work. I should, therefore, imagine that we may expect to take place in Durban in university affairs what took place in the years after 1918 in Johannesburg in similar matters, in other words, that Natal will, within a few years, also be in the position to ask for a separate university. When Natal does so the Free State will certainly not remain behind. The Free State will certainly see to it that the necessary support is given to the old historical Grey College also to make a claim for a separate university. There is already talk in Bloemfontein of a movement in that direction. If that is to be the outcome then we must enquire what the position in South Africa will be, when we shall no longer have four universities as we have to-day, or five, if this Bill passes, but eight universities. We must also remember that the University of South Africa will then be left with only two colleges, those of Potchefstroom and Wellington, and those two will probably inherit all the existing assets of the university of South Africa, including the Currie-Hiddingh Fund, which was recently established. In view of that we must enquire whether the University of South Africa, if it is left with only two colleges, which are today the weakest, will maintain the standard of its degrees. The hon. member for Brits said that we could solve the difficulty by making use of the powers granted in the Bill, and joining the two colleges to the universities of Pretoria and Stellenbosch respectively. I want, however, to draw the attention of the House to the possibility of these two colleges themselves not being prepared to join up to the University of Pretoria and Stellenbosch with all the assets of the University of South Africa. Another result of eight universities of South Africa cannot in my opinion be avoided, and it must lead to the lowering of the standard of the degrees of our universities. In this connection I want to refer to the statement before the select committee of the Secretary for Education. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The inherent value of degrees of various institutions in the University of South Africa are not therefore, to a great extent, affected by the fact that the T.U.C. will become a university, but I, of course, admit that we would ultimately have eight or nine universities in South Africa, and the outside world will Be a little suspicious about it, and I hope never to see the Union with eight or nine universities.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Brits told us&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not care, if it comes to that, let them all apply.</block>

<p>I want to ask the House to take note of the statement of the Secretary for Education, that he hoped never to see eight or nine universities. These are all questions we must bear in mind, and in view thereof the standard which we set for the establishment of a new university must be so high that we shall in the future obviate premature secessions of university colleges from the University of South Africa. It is time for us to form a clear idea of our future policy in university matters. I am sorry that the Minister of Education is not in the House now because I should like to ask him to take this opportunity to explain his policy on this important point. I come to the second point, and want to leave the future university development in our country. I now want to consider the application of the T.U.C. on its merits. On the whole they have a good and a strong case. The hon. member for Brits called me as a witness on most points, and I am quite willing to give my evidence in favour of the T.U.C., but on one point I cannot do so, and that is more particularly the financial side of the matter. I think that the position of the T.U.C., especially with reference to what I shall describe as its free capital (the Endowment Fund), of which the proceeds are at all times available for general university purposes, is not satisfactory. It is something of the very greatest importance in connection with the acknowledgment of university status of any institution for the reason that the financial question, and especially the control of free capital funds is a necessary guarantee that the institution can maintain a proper standard for its degrees. If the State gives a charter to a university it grants such an institution the right to fix its own standard without any extraneous control over its degrees. It is, therefore, necessary for the state to demand all possible guarantees in this respect. This is always necessary, and especially to-day when the Minister of Education wants to introduce a stabilizing policy, and one which is intended to put limits to the increase of grants made by the state to universities and university colleges. The universities have three sources of Income, viz., students&#x2019; fees, Government grants, and the proceeds of capital which a university has at its disposal. As for the expenditure, the universities are not to-day in such a position as to expect the expenditure to be decreased if an institution can maintain its standard of efficiency. If a university wants to keep pace with modern development in educational matters, it must be prepared to see its expenditure increasing. It is, therefore, clear that, when the grants from the State are stabilized, and the increase of students is limited&#x2014;which will probably be the case not only at the Pretoria institution, but <span class="col_1365-1366" refersTo="page_0753"/>at all the university institutions during the next few years&#x2014;a university which has no free capital will be placed in an extremely difficult position. Such a university will very soon find out that it is not able to keep the standard of the works of its departments sufficiently high, and the standard of its degrees must necessarily suffer in consequence. There is further the fact that such a university must necessarily be tempted to lower the standard of the degrees in order to try to compete with other universities, and to attract as many students as possible. Hon. members will possibly think that that does not happen in our universities, but according to my experience I must unfortunately give evidence that it has actually happened in the past. Therefore it is extremely important that before a new university is established the State should take care that such a university has sufficient free capital available. This has in fact been admitted in the past in South Africa, and only after the John Marais fund was established, after the Victoria College, Stellenbosch, had &#x00A3;100,000 at its disposal for capital purposes, was the matter of the establishment of the Stellenbosch University seriously considered. As for the position of the T.U.C. the figures are far from satisfactory to anyone who is acquainted with the meaning of figures regarding university administration. On page 11 of the annexure for the select committee&#x2019;s report we find that the T.U.C. to-day Has 102 departments, and a revenue of &#x00A3;76,000, exclusive of the veterinary department at Onderstepoort. I will assume that there are about 20, or shall I say 27, departments in the faculty of veterinary science, so that there are 75 departments in the other sections of the college. Seventy-five departments with a revenue of &#x00A3;76,000 in all. A university with that number of departments, and that income is pure nonsense, and I hope that no one in France, Germany or America will ever see the figures. I would rather assume that a mistake has been made, and that there are not 102 departments in the T.U.C. I want, further, to go into the total expenditure of the T.U.C. If we include everything, apart, of course, from the salaries, we find that the T.U.C. to-day spends no more than &#x00A3;5,000 annually in the upkeep of its department. If we look at the University of Johannesburg, we find that they annually spend &#x00A3;14,000 for that purpose. Let us, however, leave out the faculty of mechanics, because, so far as the T.U.C. is concerned, the veterinary science department is not included in the expenditure, then we arrive at a figure of about &#x00A3;11,500 for the Witwatersrand University. My personal experience is that the sum of &#x00A3;11,000 is far from adequate for the work the university is doing to-day, and therefore I must come to the conclusion that before the Pretoria University college can even do the work that it is doing to-day, it is necessary for the institution to increase its annual income by at least &#x00A3;6,000 or &#x00A3;7,000. In the light of these facts we come to the free capital which the T.U.C. has available. It was said before the select committee that a sum of &#x00A3;69,000 was available, or promised, for that purpose. I have gone into the figures in the report, but I found it extremely difficult to arrive at the figure of &#x00A3;69,000, and I can only assume that a part of the &#x00A3;69,000 is in the form of monies given for special purposes, and which cannot be regarded as free capital; the proceeds whereof are available for ordinary university purposes. When I look at the returns on pages XV and XVI of the annexures I find, in the first place, a sum of &#x00A3;3,000 as &#x201C;Rhodes Trustees Mortgage Buxton Hostel,&#x201D; and a further amount of &#x00A3;3,000 for the Louis Botha Chair of botany, and the there next succeeding amounts are sums that are only available for bursaries, and which are therefore not free capital. The money can only be used for special objects. In addition there is a further amount of &#x00A3;500 for agricultural development. Then, further, loans are given to students, and it is extremely difficult to regard them as free capital, but I find that the loans produce an annual income of &#x00A3;260. I want, therefore, to put that amount on the basis of a capital fund of &#x00A3;5,000. When I go further I see only one item which can be regarded as free capital, and that is government property to the value of &#x00A3;1,000. In all we find that the T.U.C. to-day has free capital not exceeding &#x00A3;12,500. In fairness it must also be noticed that the Pretoria Municipality has promised the college &#x00A3;25,000, which will only be paid in 5 or 10 years, and the promise of the municipality in the circumstances is not exactly a thing with which you can go to the bank. Yet, I will assume that Pretoria will find that money. To that must be added another &#x00A3;6,000 promised. I know nothing of the nature of the promises, but if I add those two amounts to the &#x00A3;12,500 I find that the college can reckon to-day on &#x00A3;43,500. When I review the figures I can say nothing else but that they are entirely inadequate to establish that university to-day. It is quite inadequate for the equipment. I know that it was stated in the evidence before the select committee that when once the college became a university it would get much more money. It was said that that was so with other institutions, and it was alleged that large grants to other universities only came after they had become independent universities. The last statement is not supported by facts. The South African College received its chief grant before it applied for a charter; Stellenbosch got its &#x00A3;100,000 from its John Marais fund before it applied for the charter; Johannesburg collected &#x00A3;180,000 from the public, and had a further &#x00A3;100,000 at its disposal as the result of the sale of buildings in connection with which promises for building loans had been made, before the institution there applied for the charter. In most of the cases the amounts which the institutions achieved were obtained before they got their charter, and in the hope of getting it. In the case of the Witwatersrand University, we find that to-day it receives about &#x00A3;20,000 annually in interest on monies invested. Ninety per cent. of the invested monies were received or promised before the university got its status. The T.U.C. on the contrary has to-day only <span class="col_1367-1368" refersTo="page_0754"/>got free capital to an amount of &#x00A3;50,000 which is available or promised. I want again to repeat that it is undesirable for a university to be created when it is not adequately equipped, and that is also apparently the view of the Minister of Education, because I understand that when the T.U.C. approached him the first time he expressed his readiness to approve of the grant of the charter, but added that the university college should first provide sufficient capital funds. The Bill he was prepared to introduce was taken out of his hands under the rules of this House. Therefore, the condition that he made fell away. The last word, however, still remains with the Minister because he, or rather the Governor-General, under Clause 1 fixes the day, when the university college will become a university, and I hope the Minister of Education will continue to take up the same attitude as at the time when he was first approached in the matter, and that he will make it clear that he is not prepared to fix the day before he is satisfied that the T.U.C. possesses at least &#x00A3;100,000 free capital, the proceeds of which will be available for general purposes. In that way the Minister will, undoubtedly, render a great service to university development in South Africa, by making the condition which will apply before other institutions get the higher status. So he will also prevent the collapse of the University of South Africa, and put a brake on the premature advancement of other university colleges. He will certainly also render a great service to the future university of Pretoria because he will certainly in that way accelerate the collection of funds considerably, and he will make it possible for the institution shortly to be properly equipped to commence its career as a university. Therefore, I once more appeal to the Minister, if possible, to make a statement as to his policy, and I hope that he will be able to remove the objection I have to the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_education">

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I think that in the case of a Bill like the one now before the House, which not only affects education in general, but more particularly higher education, I shall be expected to explain my own attitude with regard to the matter. It is for that reason that I take the first opportunity of contributing my share to the debate. In the first place, I want to say that I have heartily welcomed, from the commencement, the promotion of the T.U.C. to university status, in principle, and for that reason I was not only ready to support it, but, if the rules of the House allowed it, to personally introduce the Bill into the House. The first step was taken by me, as Minister of Education, to introduce this Bill as a Government measure; unfortunately the rules of the House did not allow it, and the Bill was placed in the hands of a private member. The fact, however, remains that I was prepared to introduce it as a Government measure, and it proved that I was prepared to co-operate on behalf of the Government in connection with this matter. If it were a question here of the establishment of a new university institution, then I have no objection to saying that I would not for a single moment have thought of it. South Africa is possibly sufficiently well provided with institutions for higher education. With the exception of one, our institutions for higher education arose before Union. The Union, therefore, succeeded to all the institutions which exist to-day, and everyone knows that when an institution of that kind has once been established, there is so much attachment to it, and so much provincial patriotism, that it is an impossible matter to abolish it. For that reason, South Africa has all these institutions, and it is practically impossible to close down one of them. If they die automatically, then it is another matter, but it is impossible to destroy one of them by means of an Act of Parliament. However, it is not here a question of an establishment of another institution. The question here is the further development of an existing institution which has exhibited extraordinary vitality. I do not think that any member of the House can object in principle to the raising of the status of the T.U.C., and for the reason that the principle which is here being followed, is not one which has been laid down for the first time in this Bill. It is a principle which was adopted as long ago as 1916 when the Universities Act was put on the statute book. That principle was then finally considered by the House, and, if the House had not wanted to adopt that policy or principle as incorporated in the Act of 1916, then it certainly would not have inserted the section in question in the Act of the University of South Africa, that anyone of the constituent colleges of that university would have the right to come to Parliament by way of a private Bill to be admitted to the status of university. In 1916, therefore, Parliament, itself, gave these colleges the right to come to the House with a Bill of this kind, when they thought that they had the right of admission to the ranks of a separate university. For that reason, it is not a new principle which is included in this Bill, and I do not think that we can at this stage object to it in this House on that ground. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Hofmeyr) said that if we permit the T.U.C. to become a university what will happen to the Rhodes University College, to Durban, to Bloemfontein, and the others. It is a good thing that he asked that question, but it is one that ought to have been put in 1916, because it was then that the right was given to those institutions to become universities along this road. The hon. member forgets that the T.U.C. in more than one respect is further advanced than even the Rhodes University College, which, if this Bill is passed, will be the most advanced college of the University of South Africa, and which will be the chief constituent college in the rank. The figures laid before the select committee prove that the T.U.C. in regard to the number of students had almost as many as the Rhodes University College and the four other colleges of the University of South Africa together. I believe the T.U.C. has 918 students, while the remaining university colleges have from 1,000 to 1,100. For all practical purposes <span class="col_1369-1370" refersTo="page_0755"/>the T.U.C. has, therefore, as many students as all the other five colleges together. It will take quite a little time before the Rhodes University College or the Bloemfontein University College will come near to the tradition of the T.U.C. The hon. member further said that if we now apply this principle and carry it to its logical conclusion, so that Rhodes, Durban, etc., can become universities, we would later on have eight universities in the country. He asks whether this will not hurt our higher education, and give our degrees a bad name. It may be so, but what real difference is there between the position that will then exist and that of to-day&#x003F; As I said, we are not dealing with the new university institution, we are dealing with one that already exists; and which, in conjunction with the other university colleges, surely grants degrees in precisely the same way as the universities of Cape Town, Stellenbosch and the Witwatersrand. Thus there will be no change if we have a few universities more. The one question that is decisive is this: has the Pretoria institution to-day reached that stage in its development that it can reasonably take advantage of the right given in 1916 to the university colleges to come to Parliament for a higher status&#x003F; I may say this, that when Parliament has to deal with a Bill of this kind in connection with the place which has an institution for higher education, we ought to be a little more accommodating with Pretoria, because Pretoria is the administrative capital of the Union.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education">

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>It has this to do with it: that there is a great deal bound up with the administrative capital of the Union. It gives considerable safety regarding the basis on which the university must be built up in future. Just because Pretoria is the administrative capital, it gives the status to it which other towns do not possess, and puts it on a safer basis than other towns. I would, therefore, be much more accommodating in the case of Pretoria, but now what is the number of students&#x003F; I need not go into this side of the question. The number of students more or less indicates the size of the institution. The number is considerably greater than the number which the existing universities had when they were admitted to the status of universities. As for the scope and thoroughness of teaching in the institution, there can be no doubt the quality of the work is equal to the quality which is done in the existing universities. If we bear these two things in mind, then I think that the T.U.C. stands the test well. Whether it is on a fixed base as regards the number of students, I say that Pretoria is the administrative capital of the Union, and there is more safety than in many other towns. I also want to point out that it is admitted that Pretoria fills a great need in the Transvaal, which the other institutions do not supply. If we look at the students that attend the Witwatersrand University, it seems that that university especially serves the urban population of the Transvaal; children of urban dwellers go to Johannesburg chiefly. Pretoria, however, chiefly draws its students from the countryside of the Transvaal. As long as that is so, and as long as the T.U.C. retains the full trust of the countryside population, it stands on a proper basis. As for what the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) said about the financial basis of the institution, I agree with him to a great extent. The financial requirements are very important. Now I think that I read in the report of the select committee that the actual amount of the endowment fund which is at the disposal of the institution is &#x00A3;69,000.</p>

<p>I was informed so. If it is so, then this amount is not far off it. When the day comes for them to accept the higher status, they will have that amount. Before I sit down I just want to say that an amendment was introduced in the select committee about which I think the House should think twice before accepting it, viz., to provide that the Senate of the future university shall have no representation on the council. If we pass this amendment, then Pretoria will be made an exception from all the other universities in the country. I think that I hear&#x2014;I do not know if there is any truth in it&#x2014;that the amendment was introduced because trouble had arisen in another institution, and, because bad feelings arose, the question was asked whether it would not be best to give the Senate no representation on the council of the university. I think it is very dangerous to make a general rule of the difficulty in one institution. The amendment would, in any case, not rectify the matter in the other institution. Why do it in connection with this proposed university&#x003F; I think the view of the select committee was that the professors of the Senate are in the service of the council, and on that account they should not have seats on the council. There is so much truth in it, of course, that the professors are in the service of the council, but there is a provision in our university legislation that the government of the institution should not be in the hands of the council alone. It is vested in the council together with the Senate, and there are matters in connection with which the Senate has a much closer knowledge than the council. The council consists of persons outside universities, and in connection with many matters they do not have the intimate knowledge that the members of the Senate have. The two bodies must remain in close touch with each other. I, therefore, hope that when this Bill comes before the House that amendment will not be passed. I further wish to give my hearty support to the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not rising to oppose this Bill. I think we shall all be pleased when we find a new university appearing on the scene in South Africa, but I think it is our duty when this little baby is laid on our doorstep, so to speak, to ask ourselves whether it has the germs of life in it, whether it is going to be a credit to the life of South Africa and uphold the standard of South African university education or not. The criticisms expressed by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Hofmeyr) have been directed to that point, and I think have been entirely sound. I hope the hon. members who are the parents or godfathers of this Bill will take note of what he has said, because these criticisms go to the root of the matter. I was disappointed to hear the Minister&#x2019;s reply to the first criticism made by the hon. member. That criticism was that this charter now given to the Pretoria university college would leave the Federal University of South Africa in such a position as to encourage and almost compel its constituent colleges to seek the same course as Pretoria is now seeking, and if that result is brought about, we are faced in the near future with the prospect of eight teaching universities in South Africa. I agree with my hon. friend, and I think most people in this country will agree, that it would not be a good thing for university education in South Africa. I think every man who looks at the position without prejudice will see we cannot properly support eight separate, independent, degree-conferring universities. The Minister said the question had already been settled, and that in 1916, when the University of South Africa was constituted by an Act of this House, it was laid down that any of the constituent colleges should have the right to come to Parliament to promote a Bill to give it a university charter. That is so; but it is a long step from giving one of these colleges that right in due time, to accepting it as a principle that whenever it comes that right should be granted. The point is not whether the Pretoria University College has the right&#x2014; of course it has&#x2014;but the question is whether this House should give it that status. That is the question to be decided. I should be very sorry if it were laid down as a principle that this House has given away the right to criticize and object to any university college coming here and asking for university status. We have a right to ask whether it is in the interests of the country that such a change should be brought about. The real difficulty about the application which is now being made is the question of finance. The Minister tells us that because Pretoria is the administrative capital of the Union, he thinks that is a ground why this application should be granted. I wish that the citizens of Pretoria would rise to the height of their great privilege as the citizens of the administrative capital of the Union, and that they would not merely put forward the fact that Pretoria as the administrative capital as a claim why they should get a university. I wish they would back their application with some local support, some financial support, by way of showing their consciousness of the privilege conferred upon them by Pretoria being the administrative capital of the Union. I would like to see them doing more to support this high position that they have got. I think that before they came to this House with a Bill such as this they ought to have provided for a more reasonable endowment fund than they show. When I was a Minister they approached me with a proposal that they should promote a Bill, and when I enquired about a possible endowment fund, they said that they were going to raise &#x00A3;250,000. I said, &#x201C;when you have raised that, come along,&#x201D; but they never came. I am afraid that something like one-tenth of that amount would cover what they have been able to raise. <span class="col_1373-1374" refersTo="page_0757"/>I hope that the Minister will see that before the appointed day is fixed, they will satisfy him that they have got an endowment fund adequate to keep up the status of a university, and not merely the status of a university, but the status of a university worthy of our administrative capital. What do we mean by endowment&#x003F; My hon. friend behind me said that an endowment fund is a fund, the interest of which is available for the general purposes of the university, and not tied up for a specific object. The income of the university comes from three sources&#x2014;from the Government (Government grants), from students&#x2019; fees, and from the proceeds of endowments. It is perfectly clear that if a university is started within adequate endowments, it is almost inevitably bound to endeavour to swell its income by attracting students in competition with other institutions and the temptation is also very strong to do so by a reduction of the standard of its degrees. That has happened elsewhere. That is the real difficulty, and the hon. member who is in charge of this Bill gave no answer to the problem in regard to endowment. There is no doubt that the endowments possessed by the Transvaal University College are not even within measurable distance of the amount mentioned by the Minister, &#x00A3;75,000. Even if you count the &#x00A3;25,000 given by the Pretoria municipality &#x2014;it is spread over ten years&#x2014;any impartial person examining these figures will see that the present endowment fund of the Transvaal University College is well under &#x00A3;50,000, and that is not an adequate endowment fund for a degree conferring university. I hope the Minister will see to it that before he fixes the appointed day, he is satisfied on that point. He will not be setting himself above the law in that respect. The law gives him that power, and we suggest that he should use it. The only other point I want to make is with regard to the representation of the senate on the university council. I was very sorry to see that the select committee amended the Bill by excluding the representative of the university senate from the university council. I hope that that representation will be restored when the Bill is in committee, as I cannot imagine anything more calculated to prevent the harmony that should exist in the governing of a university than the clause now in the Bill relating to this matter. We are glad to see a new university appearing on the scene in South Africa, but we think that the Government should lay down a definite rule with regard to applications for a higher status by university colleges that, before they will offer support to a Bill of that kind, in this House, they will see that the endowment fund is there, and that it is adequate for the purposes of the university, and that they will make that an unalterable condition to promising support for a Bill of that kind in this House.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">Rev. C. W. M. DU TOIT</person>:</from>

<p>I think we all appreciate hon. members taking so much trouble to get institutions for higher education on a very high and good standard before they actually become universities. We appreciate this in the last speaker and also in the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Hofmeyr), but I, nevertheless, think that the latter created a bit of a smoke-screen because he wanted to hide a little from us that the Johannesburg University was the sinner, in this connection, which pointed the way to other institutions. Originally there were only two separate universities, those of Cape Town and Stellenbosch, except, of course, the University of South Africa. The first which was brave enough to secede was not the T.U.C., but the Witwatersrand, and, consequently, they were the people who pointed the way to other colleges of obtaining independence. It seems to me that the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) wants to camouflage that fact a little, and to throw all the blame on to Pretoria. I think the majority of us, especially after the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that he has gone fully into the matter, are in favour of Pretoria getting the higher status at which any institution of higher education in South Africa aims, and I think we can congratulate Pretoria that they have already come so close to the realization of their ideal. I should like to say a few words in connection with Clause 26 of the Bill, which contains the so-called conscience clause, which is also contained in other higher education Acts. The matter has several times received attention in this House, and it has been fully debated at congresses and church meetings, and the attention of the outside public has been strikingly drawn to the matter. I fear the clause, as it stands, will not do. I do not wish to discuss the whole matter, but I want to point out two things, the first is that the conscience clause, as contained in Clause 26, prevents the free development of science, while in the second place I contend that the conscience clause overlooks the rights of the parents in regard to the teaching and education of their children. In the first place, I say that the provision hampers the free development of science. Science is not merely knowledge of fact, science is systemized knowledge, which behind the facts has theories and principles on the basis of which the facts are arranged. Then only does it become science. The scientist must be absolutely free in educational and research work, and I think he is free, but when we come to the investigation of facts, the systematic arrangement of facts, then the conscience clause is a decided hindrance to the free development of science, for the reason that when we come to systematized knowledge, i.e., when a man puts his findings in scientific form, science is definitely divided into two groups. The first is the neutral group, and the other is the Christian group; one is neutral science and the other is Christian science. Christian science and Christian scientists, when adopting their theories and principles, hear in mind the complete Christian world-view, and the source and form of the Christian life, viz., the scriptures. Let me here mention what Advocate Terpstra from Holland said in this connection, viz., that neutrality in connection with science meant that an independent line was adopted, just as the Christian line has a direction of its own in the scientific world, and the neutral direction is one that simply puts on one side <span class="col_1375-1376" refersTo="page_0758"/>the religious beliefs, and the conscience clause puts a premium on the neutral tendency. Let me then point out that no one in South Africa, e.g., can be appointed under the conscience clause, not even in Pretoria if it becomes a university, because he is a supporter of the Christian scientific view. It says expressly at the end of Clause 26 that no one shall be privileged or prejudiced by reason of his religious belief. If there are two, three or more applicants for an appointment, and two of them are equal, but one has a Christian view of the world, as will be seen from his thesis or essay for the doctor&#x2019;s degree, then he may not be appointed, because he follows the Christian scientific view. What is more, I want to show from the fact that this clause prevents an institution from calling itself a Christian institution. During the discussion of the policy of the G.U.C. at Bloemfontein, it appeared when they wanted to adopt the view and the spirit of the majority of the Free State population, that it could not be done. It is not permissible to say that an institution follows a definitely Christian national view as the majority in the Free State wish. The section forbids it. I want to point out that the T.U.C., before it was incorporated in the University of South Africa, was the &#x201C;Potchefstroom University College for Christian higher education,&#x201D; but on incorporation in 1921, the institution was prevented from continuing to hold the last part of its title. Under this clause all must be neutral institutions for higher education, and no definitely Christian institutions may be included with the sole exception of the Native College at Fort Hare, which may be a definitely Christian college. I think that such a clause which hampers the Christian scientific development is not fair; that it is not fair that a college cannot appoint a man because he follows a Christian direction. It simply means that a premium is given to the so-called neutral institutions, and that the Christian direction is hampered; but the clause further hampers the right of parents to decide in what direction and spirit their children shall be educated. The child does not belong to the state, but to its parents. No one can contest that, but what do we find&#x003F; The parents cannot decide on what lines, whether neutral or Christian, their child shall be educated, but the state decides. As if the child belonged to the state! The state can decide the direction, but the organized parents ought to be able to do it. What is the position to-day&#x003F; The parents have no say, are powerless with regard to higher education even in our country. I only want to mention one theory in connection with higher education&#x2014;because I think we should speak frankly on this matter&#x2014;and it is evolution theory. That hypothesis has already changed its colour very much in the scientific world; there has been a big departure from the original view of the supporters of the theory, as preached by Haeckel, Darwin and Lamarque, and you find, e.g., the view now held by learned men that man does not descend from some kind of animal or from apes as was the original theory, but from Madagascar cats. I mention these things not to scoff, but I want to point out that one of the greatest supporters of this theory, the American Professor Osborne, has again stated quite recently that he does not believe in it any longer, although he, at first, always was a follower of that supposition. He does not believe at all now in the common descent of men and animals, but that they were separate from the start. This is not the point now, but what I want to come to is that the theory, which has already changed colour so much, nevertheless, contains extremely dangerous tendencies for the South African people as for any Christian people. I just want to mention a few names of learned men who have spoken in this connection. In the first place, Professor D. M. S. Watson, when the British Association was here last year, and debated the matter, replied to the question as to why the evolution theory was accepted by many scientists, that it was not because it had been logically and consistently proved that it was true, but because the other alternative, viz., the creation was incredible to them because they could not accept it. This shows that evolution in its deepest germ is diagonally opposed to the Christian teaching derived from the scriptures. I still also want to quote the great scientist Kuyper, who expressed himself very concisely on the matter, when he said that evolution was a new belief, which had put itself diagonally opposite to the Christian belief, and could only build its temple on the ruins of our Christian confession. Those are the words of that great man, and I only want, in addition, to refer to W. J. Bryan, who was more than once a candidate for the presidency of the United States, and who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Evolution is the basis of modernism. Carried to its logical conclusion, it is destructive of revealed religion. This is what a declared agnostic made of Darwin (read his &#x201C;Life and Letters&#x201D;) a letter which he wrote on this subject shortly before his death. This made agnostics of millions, and atheists of hundreds of thousands. Nevertheless, the Christian taxpayers were not on their guard, and permitted Darwinism to be implanted in the minds of youthful students, many of whom came back with their spiritual enthusiasm chilled and sometimes destroyed.</block>

<p>Then he goes further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we protest against the teaching of this &#x201C;tommy rot&#x201D; by teachers who are paid by the taxpayers, they accuse us of forcing the conscience and hampering freedom. Nothing of the sort. Let the atheist think what he wishes, and say what he desires to those that will listen to him, but he cannot demand payment from the taxpayer when he teaches the children what the taxpayer does not want. As long as Christians have to establish Christian educational institutions to have their doctrines taught, the atheists must be compelled to erect their own educational institutions, if they want to propagate atheism.</block>

<p>Those are the views of great men in other countries, and we see a continuous and great danger <span class="col_1377-1378" refersTo="page_0759"/>in the evolution theory, but here it is once more protected in the clause, and the University of Pretoria will also come under it. Now, in conclusion, I want to add, and I believe that I speak on behalf of other hon. members who feel the same as I do, that we do not intend, because the conscience clause is included in the Bill, to move an amendment in committee in connection with it. The reason for the attitude is that the Secretary for Education distinctly said in the select committee that the matter was being considered by the Government. We therefore feel that it is best not to touch the matter at the moment, nor do we want to oppose the institution in Pretoria on this account. I believe we are in the position of being able to say that we are approaching the time when the difficulty will be got rid of, and the hon. member for Piquetberg (Mr. de Waal), our present honoured speaker, wrote some time ago in the public press that in his opinion the matter could be settled by a compromise; that the dispute was not at all of such magnitude that it could not be settled by both parties without their sacrificing their principles, and he added that thousands of readers would heartily welcome such a solution. I agree that the time is approaching when the matter will be solved without the sacrifice of principles in such a spirit that the conscience clause in the future will, indeed, prohibit religious tests, and will, indeed, prohibit that advantage, or detriment should be occasioned by reason of church membership, but that yet an institution shall not be prevented from appointing a man because he respects the Christian scientific point of view, I hope that that day is very close, and I am sure that the T.U.C. will help us and will join the movement to obtain it, because in answer to a question by the hon. member for Winburg (Dr. N. J. van der Merwe), the head of the T.U.C., on behalf of the council of the college, definitely replied that they would like the institution to be known as a Christian national one. He was then asked if that would be in agreement with the wishes of the large majority of the parents who sent their children to the institution, and his reply was &#x201C;yes.&#x201D; I hope the new university will co-operate to arrive at a satisfactory solution in connection with this important point with regard to science in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oost">

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OOST</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. members for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Hofmeyr) and Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) have placed their fatherly hand protectively on the Bill for the future university of Pretoria, but the former did not omit to give rather a slap to the university he wants to protect, towards the end of his speech. I do not think those hon. members, or any other member, have any reason for objecting to this development of the T.U.C., because the fact is that the bond between Johannesburg and Pretoria is always increasing. When we drive along the road between Johannesburg and Pretoria to-day, it is practically a succession of houses, and we can almost talk about one big city. In the development that is taking place in Pretoria in the iron and steel industry, and other industrial developments, even in scientific matters, Johannesburg may one day be promoted and become one of the big suburbs of Pretoria. I want to point out that the arguments used by the hon. member for Yeoville do not hold water. The reserve fund which the University of Pretoria will dispose of amounts to about &#x00A3;69,000, and the hon. member for Yeoville, when he was in office, said that he would be satisfied if &#x00A3;75,000 was available. That &#x00A3;6,000 could easily be obtained. The question has been asked whether the time has come for the T.U.C. to become a university, but Mr. C. C. Grant, the Registrar of the University of South Africa, and, therefore, an official of the university, who is in the position of giving the best information, told the select committee that the development of the T.U.C. into a university was only a natural development. He says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not think anyone regards the University of South Africa as permanent. I regard it more or less as a temporary institution to keep the smaller colleges together, and to enable them to mutually assist each other until such time as they reach the standard of a university.</block>

<p>Then I want to refer hon. members to another witness before the select committee, Dr. Gie, also an expert whom we ought to take notice of. In answer to a question whether there ought not to be a certain amount of competition between universities, he replied affirmatively provided the universities were strong enough. He continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think that that is so in the case of Pretoria.</block>

<p>I think that if the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) is really sorry for the University of South Africa, which the registrar of that university is not, then he ought not to come and feel sorry now, but he ought to have been so in 1921, when he was pleading for the university of the Witwatersrand. With reference to what the hon. member for Edenberg (the Rev. C. W. M. du Toit) said, I want to point out that he dealt with the conscience clause in a thorough way. It is a matter which has already provoked great interest not only in the homes of parents, but also in the upper House and in this House, where it has been debated several times. We not only declare ourselves against that clause, but it is laid down in our constitution, and, in addition, in Clause 1&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The people of the Union acknowledge the sovereignty and guidance of Almighty God.</block>

<p>Can anything be clearer than this declaration&#x003F; Is that the God of the doctrine of evolution, or the God of the Bible&#x003F; This section of the constitution refers to no one other than the God of the Bible. Compare it, however, with Clause 26 of this Bill and the clauses in other Acts with reference to our university, because this clause unfortunately applies to all our universities, and it is directly in conflict with the provisions of Section 1 of our constitution. What are the facts&#x003F; It appeared from the evidence before the select committee that it was <span class="col_1379-1380" refersTo="page_0760"/>not only a matter of principle, but also of practice. An instance was quoted where professors abused the freedom under this clause, and tried to educate our youth in conflict with Section 1 of the constitution. There is also a private intimation to establish this. I think that Victor Hugo is quite right when he said that various people suffer from different kinds of blindness and the blindness of the scientist is that he does not know how stupid he is. If that is true, then it is our duty to see to it, even if it is not done now, that this matter is put right in future, and to see that the conscience clause becomes such a clause as no longer to hurt our conscience. I do not think we ought to do so in this Bill. As hon. members opposite are fairly doubtful with regard to this question, we shall have in the future to make efforts to put the matter right, but it must be put right as certain as Section 1 is to-day contained in the constitution.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>After the remarks of the last speaker, I cannot remain silent any longer. I was a member of the select committee to which the measure was referred. Evidence was given before the select committee with regard to what is called the conscience clause, and I would like to read a reply I received from Professor du Toit, the Rector of the Transvaal University College, on this clause. I put the following question to Professor du Toit&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Supposing a religious test were imposed, is it not possible that men of very high culture indeed might be prevented from filling important positions &#x003F;</block>

<p>He replied: &#x201C;Undoubtedly.&#x201D; My next question was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the whole would that be a disaster to the intellectual development of our people &#x003F;</block>

<p>The answer was: &#x201C;Academically, certainly great harm might result.&#x201D; I then asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is there anything you can do to prevent an atheist who might be a very ardent scientist from using his position in such a way as to advance his views &#x003F;</block>

<p>The reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A reasonable interpretation of this clause was that a member of the staff may not use his influence unduly to pervert the ideas of the students.</block>

<p>When I asked Professor du Toit if there were any means of dealing with professors who perverted the views of students, Professor du Toit answered&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When a man makes himself particularly obnoxious the council certainly has a means of dealing with him. The same applies to direct party political propaganda.</block>

<p>Replying to my question whether the council could sit in judgment on its staff and decide that a man was unsuitable, Professor du Toit said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If such a condition were considered, one or two conditions must be satisfied. One condition is that the man must be incompetent to do his work, and the other is that there must have been a breach of discipline.</block>

<p>I then put the question: &#x201C;Or his influence is undesirable &#x003F;&#x201D;, and received the reply that that would be a breach of discipline in extreme cases. I protest strongly against anything which would subject professors and teachers to persecution and inquisition regarding their religious beliefs. My test would be whether a man lived a decent life and was fit for his post. Whether he belongs to this, that or any other religious denomination means nothing at all as regards fitness to teach. The danger of applying religious tests is that you may have unscrupulous men, who, in order to obtain an appointment, would be prepared to subscribe to what they do not believe to be the truth. With regard to the constitution of the council, when it was proposed to omit sub-section (d) of sub-section (1) of Clause 7, I was the only member of the select committee to vote against the suggestion. I maintain that the council should be a true reflex of the university, and that undoubtedly it should comprise members of the senate. The Bill, as originally drafted, provided for three members of the senate to sit on the council. The argument against the inclusion of members of the senate was that the senate might have its actions reviewed by the council, and therefore&#x2014;so it was urged&#x2014;it was wrong that members of the senate should be on the council. If that were so, to be logical, the Rector himself would have to be excluded from the council, as he is not only a member of the senate, but its chairman. I told my fellow-members I was going to oppose this amendment in the House, and I hope the clause will be restored. I want to emphasize what has been so clearly stated by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) and the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Hofmeyr) that the Minister shall use every discretion before allowing this university to come into being. We are not opposed to the establishment of the university qua university. I think it is deplorable that we are breaking up into so many universities; with our population we are not able to carry so many fully-fledged ones. However, it is no good arguing that point, and it is there for better or worse. I do hope, and more than hope, I pray, that this university will not gradually drift into an Afrikaans-speaking university, but that it will be truly South African without any trend to that division which is so deplorable. I would like to see the youth of this country mixed up as much as possible, without regard to the language they may use. Reverting to the Minister&#x2019;s reply on the financial provision, it is somewhat misleading to say the assets are such and such. Most of them are not revenue earning, and, even so, if this &#x00A3;69,000 were a certainty, it would be different. Most of it is due to promises which come to an end at a certain date. I would like to see a consolidated revenue earning fund, the interest from which could not be touched except for university purposes. Then, <span class="col_1381-1382" refersTo="page_0761"/>as regards the number of students. In 1928 the Transvaal University College had 775 students and collected &#x00A3;14,705 in students&#x2019; fees; Rhodes University College with 454 collected &#x00A3;11,584. I quote that to show that there must be something wrong in regard to the former figures; either the fees were remarkably low, or a number of students were not in permanent residence. What number are extra-mural&#x003F; There is no doubt that the point raised by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) as regards other colleges following the example of the Transvaal college in claiming full university status, is perfectly true. In every case I hope the Ministry of the day will see to it that the institutions claiming university standing answer fully the requirements that we lay down. I would like to know whether, being one of the capitals of the country, is, as has been stated by the Minister, a qualification for having a university. The Minister said that one of Pretoria&#x2019;s great claims for a university is that it is the administrative capital of the Union. That claim I wish to traverse from the start. Leyden is the leading university of Holland, but whoever heard it said it was the capital city&#x003F; Amsterdam has two universities, but how many has the Hague&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#van_broekhuizen">

<from>&#x2020;*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN BROEKHUIZEN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall not detain the House long, just a few words about the learned and eloquent speech of my hon. friend the member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Hofmeyr). We are thankful for the magnanimous attitude he and other Johannesburg members have adopted in connection with this matter, and we appreciate it. The hon. member will agree with me that if we follow history, and I believe in the historical line, the T.U.C. certainly has the right of becoming a university. The hon. member for Springs (Sir Robert Kotze) will remember that in the republican days there was a gymnasium in Pretoria. Higher education was given there by persons of a high scientific rank. Yes, the quality of the education in the S.A. Republic was such that they got the gold medal at the Paris exhibition in 1899. That was the start of the university which is now coming into existence. Pretoria has a right to a university, not only because it is the administrative capital, but for historical reasons. Secondly, there is the number of students and the faculties there are there. The number of students has now nearly reached a thousand, and as the Minister has already said, those students chiefly come from the countryside. There are many hon. members who agree with me that there are parents in the Transvaal, in fact throughout the Union, who do not like sending their children to the big towns. It is also the case in other countries that you do not find the universities in the big towns. In America there are Yale and Harvard. We have the university of Leyden, we have Oxford and Cambridge, none of which is a big city, but are remotely situated. That is one of the reasons why parents prefer sending their children to Pretoria, than to Johannesburg. With regard to the right of the T.U.C. to become a university, the question was asked what is to become of the other colleges. The Minister has already replied to this. I should like to give a different answer. I do not share the convictions that the others will all become universities. My reason is that the number of students at the other institutions, with the exception of Rhodes is very small, and the only solution is for them to affiliate with the other universities. Potchefstroom belongs to Pretoria, and Wellington to Stellenbosch. Where the university students will slowly increase and the colleges, excepting a few, will become smaller and the number at the University of South Africa will be about 1,200 which is strong enough. I do not, however, want to follow the example of other members and play the prophet, but, at the same time, I do not want to go into this matter because I am convinced that the other university colleges during the next twenty years will not take this step. In this connection I should like to quote from the evidence of Dr. Gie before the select committee. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes. It may be said that the withdrawal of the T.U.C. will result in the University of South Africa becoming of lesser importance as regards the scope of its work. But this possibility was foreseen in the legislation of 1916, and the same objection could have been urged against the giving of a charter to the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. The usefulness of the university of South Africa in regard to work of the institutions still remaining will, however, not be impaired. In my opinion the benefit to the public of the giving of a university charter to the Transvaal University College will more than compensate for any possible weakness to be suffered in consequence by the University of South Africa. The work would be of lesser importance, but I do not think the work would be impaired, and if, to some extent, owing to the fact that a large number of professors who now serve on the Senate in the University of South Africa from the Transvaal University College are now withdrawn, there is, to some extent, an impairment of the work I give it as my definite opinion that the gain to higher education by the Transvaal University College having a charter will more than outweigh any possible weakness which may result to the University of South Africa.</block>

<p>Here we have it plainly and clearly stated that there is no danger where other university colleges are concerned. It is very plain and clear. The hon. members for Yeoville and Johannesburg (North) spoke about the establishment of the Witwatersrand University. I have carefully <span class="col_1383-1384" refersTo="page_0762"/>read the report of the select committee about the Bill concerned, and did not find anywhere anything being said of the &#x201C;Endowment&#x201D;, not even in connection with Stellenbosch. When the Witwatersrand University was established, the University of South Africa and the Department of Education protested. The University objected. In this case no objection is made by the University of the Minister. It is accepted as the necessary solution, that the T.U.C. must become a university, and I cannot understand why all these considerations are referred to in connection with the matter. If we look at the speeches on the Federal University in 1913 then we find that Minister F. S. Malan &#x201C;condemned the federal system in no measured terms and the federal system could be justified only as a temporary scheme&#x201D;. That was the view of the Minister of Education at the time. Then I come to the last point, the financial position. The laboratory at Onderstepoort is equal to about &#x00A3;500,000 in the endowment fund. I should like to say this, that we can be assured the money will be there. When the Witwatersrand University was established it had promises of money for the endowment fund. We have the same promises, and when we have become a university the funds will be there. &#x00A3;69,000 has been promised when we, become university. I can assure the House that Pretoria and all the towns of the Transvaal will see that we have the money when the T.U.C. is made a university. Sentiment rules the world, and we feel that on the 10th October, the birthday of President Kruger, when Pretoria celebrates her 75th birthday and is proclaimed a city, we can make a great appeal. All these things will co-operate and assist us, and therefore I am glad that such a measure of unanimity exists in the House to pass this Bill. The money will be there. Class fees have also been referred to. The &#x00A3;14,000 does not include agriculture, hence it is not so high. The agricultural section at Onderstepoort is not included, otherwise it would have been &#x00A3;2,000 more. I do not wish to detain the House. We are glad that it is felt on all sides that the University of Pretoria should be created, and I trust the House will unanimously pass the Bill.</p>

<p>I think it will be agreed on all siles of the House that the second reading of this Bill has been approached in a non-party spirit by almost every speaker. That was what took place in the discussions on the original Bill in 1923. The views which have been expressed during this debate have been of the most varied character, and I think they are a true reflection of the confusion of thought and of purpose which exists widely throughout the whole of the Union. Under the circumstances that we have to-day, when, at this very moment, a select committee is sitting considering the whole of the native question in a spirit of national responsibility and probing fully into every aspect of the question&#x2014;I am very sorry, very disappointed and very much surprised indeed that the Minister has not chosen to dismiss the second reading of this Bill and send it to that select committee. Naturally the full effect of native policy or lack of it at the economic point of contact must come into consideration. The Urban Areas Act will form, no doubt, one of the points of discussion. This Bill limits us to the existing machinery without furnishing it with any greater driving force of principle. It merely endeavours to tighten up the existing Act in certain respects, but it is doing nothing whatever to prevent the growth of that great native population in our urban areas which everybody sees as a menace to our future. The Bill provides for more effective segregation in the urban areas, and sets out to improve the conditions of the natives in those areas; it gives power to the local authorities to deal with the idle and the dissolute and to arrest, now and then, an unemployed native. But the creation of huge native cities adjacent to our European towns is still left entirely to chance; we are not touching that problem at all. For these reasons I think the Bill should go to a select committee. There is a lack of real understanding of the policy to which we are committed in the urban areas. I quite realize the difficulties with which the Government is faced. All sorts of interests bring their influence to bear upon the Government to take this or that step, and its path becomes very difficult. The debate has revealed a certain unanimity of opinion along certain lines. There seems to be a general agreement that there is a menacing drift of the natives to our towns, and there is also general agreement that the drift should be prevented. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) in discussing this emphasized the drift and its attendant evils; he also pointed out that the better conditions created in the towns for the natives offered a lure to induce them to come to the towns. The Prime Minister also dwelt on this drift, and practically every speaker has referred to this aspect. Witnesses before the select committee also laid stress on this matter. The representatives of the Cape Town Municipality stated in evidence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The influx of natives to Cape Town is a very serious question and I do not know whether, if we were granted greater powers, we could deal with it. The natives seem to be on the march to Cape Town because of the attractions of the city; they like the regular hours of employment in town life; they like the bioscopes; they enjoy the <span class="col_1385-1386" refersTo="page_0763"/>facilities to walk about the streets as they like, and the glamour of the high wages paid in Cape Town is an incentive not only for the natives to accumulate in but to gravitate towards Cape Town. Another thing which attracts them is that they may, once established here, secure poor relief from the institutions in Cape Town, should necessity arise, and this is undoubtedly having the effect of attracting natives and coloured from the rural areas.</block>

<p>Bloemfontein says the same thing. They have an influx of 1,000 redundant natives a year whom they cannot employ. Johannesburg tells the same story, and paints a picture which we ought all to look at&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We find that Johannesburg is getting a greater population than it needs or requires or that will be of any use to the town. There are thousands of children there who will become a danger to the town, and the same applies to all the big towns in the Union. It is the infantile population that is going to create the trouble. They will only make very cheap labour and you can never send them back to their tribal conditions. This state of affairs is going to injure both the white and the black population.</block>

<p>Here we have a picture of the whole country from which it would appear that this drift was becoming alarming. The fact is that since the passing of the 1923 Act, there has been an increase in the native population of Johannesburg of 15 per cent., excluding the mines, and in Durban of 20 per cent. To get the true aspect of these figures, the fact should be considered that the increase of the European population of Durban during the same period has been only 17 per cent. But these figures do not tell the whole tale, nor give the true perspective. Seventy-five per cent. of the total urban population of natives are males, and less than .05 are under 15 years of age. Now the evils inseparable from the state of affairs when 75 per cent. of the native population are leading unnatural lives, separated altogether from the influence of family life, cannot be too much emphasized. They strike us in the face. There is the recent incidents in Johannesburg, of so gross and immoral a character that the natives had to take the law into their own bands. When a murder gang can exist for years and the natives are driven to kill in self-defence, matters are coming to a bad pass. When every European town has as its adjunct a very much larger body of natives &#x2014;and there is no difference of opinion on these facts&#x2014;they have been emphasized by most of the speakers, matters will be serious. There is a slight difference of opinion as to the cause of the drift to the towns. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) on this question said the cause was due in some measure to lack of laud in the reserves, and to our not doing all that is possible to keep the natives in the reserves. The Prime Minister seemed to think it was a world phenomenon, and, in this connection recommended us to read a book by Thorald Rodgers. The causes, no doubt, are many and varied. During the course of his speech, the Prime Minister said a most amazing thing; he said the drift of natives to the towns cannot be stopped. If the Prime Minister is correct we may as well throw up the sponge altogether. If the drift is to continue, we must visualize a state of affairs when we have huge native cities dominating all our European towns. What the position would then be, I do not care to contemplate. But the Minister of Lands thinks the drift can Be stopped, and the hon. member for Roodepoort (Col. Stallard) thinks it can be stopped: I share their opinion. But do we want to stop it&#x003F; Are we prepared, if measures can be adopted to stop the drift to adopt them, or are we satisfied to let things slide and say &#x201C;sufficient for the day is the evil thereof&#x201D;&#x003F; Is it merely a debating point, this drift to the towns&#x003F; Are we bent on tinkering with the machinery without the wish to set it right&#x003F; If we are sincere in this matter then the one thing necessary is a national objective in South Africa. Without it, we can achieve nothing. This debate has revealed the fact that no two individuals think alike. Everybody approaches the problem from his own individual angle, in the light of his experiences or his predilection. But the debate has revealed this, that there is an insistent need throughout the whole of South Africa for a clearly defined objective in our native affairs. Not a mere generalization which everybody interprets according to whim or fancy, but a clear-cut understanding as to what we in South Africa are aiming at, whether, indeed, we are on the lines to develop a black proletariate, or whether, on the other hand, we are endeavouring to create a bantu nation. During the course of this debate considerable doubt has been cast upon the underlying principle of the Urban Areas Act of 1923. The hon. member for Roodepoort (Col. Stallard) contended that the underlying principle of the 1923 Act was that the native was a sojourner in our midst. He was in our urban areas solely to administer to the needs of the Europeans, and only so long as his services were needed, only so long could he remain in the urban areas. The hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) (Mr. Coulter) disputes that. He takes the old traditional attitude of the Cape. He says that was not the avowed purpose of the Bill; that the 1923 Act was meant solely to improve the housing of the natives and improve conditions generally in urban areas. Here we have the old tradition, which always rises before us whenever we discuss native affairs, the conflict between the north and south. The views of the north were expounded before the select committee by the mayor of Bloemfontein in these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the Free State and Transvaal the location traditionally has been regarded merely as a reservoir for supplying the labour requirements of the Europeans in the towns. From the time the Voortrekkers crossed the Orange River that has been the Free State conception of the native location.</block>

<p><span class="col_1387-1388" refersTo="page_0764"/>But before the same select committee the representatives of Cape Town expressed themselves as being diametrically opposed to this, and said that the principle which governed the administration of the Cape Town Municipality was the recognition of natives rights of ownership in their urban locations. In other words if the right to create a native city. Here is a conflict of opinion which it is absolutely essential in the interests of South Africa, that we should reconcile and not allow to continue, as it simply prevents all lucid exposition of the native question. What really was intended by the 1923 Act&#x003F; I have before me here a report of the debates on the Urban Areas Act of 1923. In the light of the position as we see it to-day, these reports make very strange and ominous reading. The principle which the hon. member for Roodepoort has enunciated as the underlying principle of the original Act, and which is being disputed in the course of this debate, was brought out very strongly in 1923 by no less a person than the present Prime Minister who was then the leader of the Opposition. It was confirmed unmistakeably by my right hon. friend the present leader of the Opposition. Let us go back to the actual reports themselves. It must be remembered that the Native Urban Areas Act was drawn up in 1923; the Native Commission was consulted, and the Native Commission, I presume, inserted a clause in the original Bill that natives could obtain title to land in all locations in urban areas. The Prime Minister, who was then the leader of the Opposition strenously opposed it, together with the members of the Labour party, and he used these words in the second reading debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To him it was clear that the Native Affairs Commission had never received any information from the Government of the line along which it should work and make recommendations to the House. The Bill said a native should have the right to acquire land in a location, and also in the villages. They were dealing with land which, according to the law of 1913, was clearly white man&#x2019;s land, in which a native could not acquire or rent land. Taking that into account now it will enable native to become land-owners in such areas. Thus they were renouncing the principle definitely adopted in 1913. It should have been made clear that on white man&#x2019;s land the native was only a temporary resident.</block>

<p>What an echo of the words and ideas used by the hon. member for Roodepoort! He also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If conditions should arise in the days to come that, on the grounds of public policy, it was proved that natives could not remain there, it would give the impression again of being guilty of breaches of faith.</block>

<p>The leader of the Opposition was not alone in this opinion. The present Minister of Lands was emphatic on this matter. He said that natives had no rights in urban areas, and if it was so, it was in direct conflict with the Act. The present Minister of Defence, then the leader of the Labour party, was also very positive about the evil which would arise if natives were allowed rights in urban areas. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was against the public policy of the country to encourage the immigration and settlement of natives in white areas.</block>

<p>The whip of the Labour party in those days, Mr. Mullineaux, strangely enough, quoted a memorandum written by Col. Stallard with very great approval, putting forward the views expressed by that hon. member the other day; and finally the right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) the then Prime Minister, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So far as the native question is a land question, we have to adhere to the policy laid down in 1913. Hon. members must not be under the impression that either by means of the Bill, or in any other way, we, as an item of policy of the Government, wish to depart from the policy laid down by the common consent of all parties in this country. We are doing our best to carry out that policy.</block>

<p>Without a shadow of doubt the policy adopted by the House on that day in 1923 was that urban areas are merely places in which natives could reside while ministering to the wants of Europeans. Where are we now&#x003F; One ought to ask that question after seven years of administration of the Urban Areas Act in 1923. During the second reading debate of 1923 an endeavour was made to estimate the effects of the Bill when it came into operation. The drift of natives to the towns was just as acute in those days, and various speakers dwelt upon it; it was estimated that the coming into operation of the Act of 1923 would expel from the urban areas 100,000 natives. Where do we find ourselves to-day&#x003F; Not only did the Act fail to expel the 100,000, but it has encouraged an increase in the native population in seven years of 20 per cent. in certain areas. It is obvious in respect of stopping the drift of the natives to the towns that the Bill has completely failed. It has failed solely because we have not recognized the underlying principle of the Bill. There is only one thing to be done in order to get back to where we were in 1923, and that is to place a better check on the entry of natives into urban areas. More effective machinery is required than that proposed in the Bill. Powers should be taken, if necessary, as suggested by the hon. member for Roodepoort (Col. Stallard), but it is impossible to explore these objections if we are going into committee of the whole House. Several amendments have been drawn up, but it is perfectly certain that the Chairman will rule that they cannot be accepted as they are against the principle of the Bill. It is, therefore, essential that the Bill should be referred to the joint select committee now considering the native problem. If this measure is considered in conjunction with other legislative proposals, we may arrive at a better Bill than the one we are now discussing. <span class="col_1389-1390" refersTo="page_0765"/>It has been emphasized in the course of the debate that if the natives are driven out of the urban areas, they have no place to which to go. Where can they go&#x003F; It is useless to say they can go to the reserves in certain areas which are under populated. You cannot send strange natives to Zululand without the risk of their being killed, nor can you send strange natives to squat in native reserves under tribal control and expect them to leave peacefully. It is essential in order that the machinery which the Minister has provided in the Bill should prove workable that we should determine where the natives are to go, and that point can be considered only by the joint committee on the native problem. I suggest the time has come for a thorough overhaul of this whole problem and that we should not push forward a Bill which merely deals with some evils which have arisen over the administration of the Act. If the Minister will do that and the committee which has been set up in the convention atmosphere&#x2014;an atmosphere which, I hope, will continue&#x2014;will also consider this measure, we shall achieve a much better result.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that under the existing circumstances I cannot, on this occasion, convey the congratulations of the town council and the inhabitants of the Kroonstad to the Minister with reference to the provision about trading licences in locations. It is not easy to object to a measure introduced by the Government, but the matter has been so seriously entrusted to me by the public of Kroonstad that I cannot neglect it. We know that the whole of the Free State agrees on this point, that we should not only object, but that we should also call the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that we feel very much hurt about the provision which will leave it in the hands of the Minister to issue trading licences in locations when the local authorities do not approve of it. It may appear merely a small question to hon. members, but it is an important principle, and if there are people who feel very much hurt about it, then it is the Free Staters. It is, therefore, necessary for us to oppose this motion. I do not wish to enter upon that groundless argument that the Free State is opposing this from sheer obstinacy, or selfishness. Why should it be applied in the Free State if we do not want it there&#x003F; If the Bill is passed in its present form, then the principle is sacrificed which was laid down by the old pioneers of the Free State. It is an existing principle, and if we repeal it, we cannot reintroduce it. It is one of those principles which we are much attached to. I want to ask the Minister why at this period he wants to force something on it that we do not want in the Free State at all&#x003F; Hon. members from the Free State have opposed it as one man, and hon. members opposite have expressed the view that our opposition is very strange. In the past we went so far as to exclude the Free State in various Acts, e.g., in the Liquor Act where the Minister of Justice two years ago exempted the Free State from certain provisions. All we now ask the Minister of Native Affairs is to take count of the people of the Free State, and to also exclude them in this case. We do not want the provision about trading licences in locations enforced in the Free State, and we do not come as children, but like children to the footstool of the Minister, and ask him, seeing we are so absolutely opposed to it, not to apply it to us. In Kroonstad, e.g., we have a white population of about 7,500 and between 9,000 and 10,000 natives. Suppose we were to allow the granting of trading licences to people in locations, then in the near future we shall have two big trading villages next to each other, and there will be great competition between the whites and the natives. That position would then be exploited by the kind of person who is already to-day exploiting the native. Therefore it will not be advantageous to the development of the native. If we sacrifice the principle we open the door, and the consequences will cost us dear. If one or other hon. member has turned a somersault, ft makes no difference so far as the Free State is concerned, all the other members stand together in opposition to the repeal of the principle. I further want to point out that the hon. leader of the Opposition, Gen. Smuts, said in 1924, while he was still Prime Minister, that the old Free State laws were the best we had in the country. Why then should he abandon that principle when we have already made exceptions for the Free State before, and have asked the Minister not to apply it to the Free State&#x003F; We come to the feet of the Minister and beseech him not to apply it in the Free State. If the second reading of the Bill is passed as it stands, we shall do so with a despondent mind.</p>

<p>I also welcome the Bill because it will result especially in the towns and villages that segregation will be more effectively applied than has possibly been the case in the past, and, secondly, because the Bill will result in and aim at the restriction of the streaming of natives to the towns and villages. Just on this matter I agree with the hon. member for Roodepoort (Col. Stallard) that, as regards the restrictions and controlling powers, sufficient powers are not granted to the local authorities. I will not enlarge here on the principle of segregation whether in general or in part, because I am convinced that all who mean well with the white race in South Africa, the continuance of the white race, respect the principle of segregation. It is universally acknowledged that, rightly or wrongly, total segregation is no longer possible in South Africa, and that all we can effect to-day is partial segregation; whether that is so or not, the fact remains that so far as towns and villages are concerned, it is still more easy to apply partial segregation to-day, than on the countryside. One of the most important amendments that are being made is that the power is granted to the local authorities to restrict and control the streaming of natives to the towns and villages, and it is just in this respect that, in my opinion, the Bill does not give sufficient powers. Before the power can be granted to local <span class="col_1391-1392" refersTo="page_0766"/>authorities, two things must take place. Firstly, the Governor-General, under Section 3 (1) of the principal Act, must proclaim that from a certain date all natives must live in a location within the boundaries of the town or village area, or within a definite portion of the town or village area. In the second place, according to sub-clause 3 (6a) of this Bill, all local authorities that are proclaimed in their entirety under Section 3 (1) of the principal Act, must hold a meeting and pass a resolution after which the Governor-General, if he thinks fit, can proclaim that after a fixed date no native can enter the urban area to look for work, or to accept it, or to live there except under the condition stated in the proclamation. It seems to me that the policy which must be followed before this provision comes into force is much too circumlocutory, and I further think that the right to make use of the power is much too dependent on the discretion of the person who may be the Minister at any particular time. As long as the present Minister is in office, or as long as there is a Government which wants to enforce the principle of segregation, there will be no objection, but somebody else may be Minister of Native Affairs, and another person may be there when the provisions of the Bill have to be administered, and, therefore, if we do not now grant quite adequate powers to the town councils and local boards, the whole object of the Bill may possibly be rendered futile. Further, I think that provision must be made for the sending back of superfluous natives that are found within the borders of our towns and villages. It will be impossible to send all of them back because they have possibly already been living for a generation or more in the town or village. There are, however, thousands in whose case it can be decided from what territory, location or farm they have come, and when it can be proved that they are superfluous, then the Government or the local board ought to have the power to send them back to the location, farm or native territory whence they originally came. I do not want to enter upon all the reasons why these natives go to the towns, enough has already been said on it. I only want, with all my force, to protest against the complaint made by certain negrophilists, and which has been repeated in this House to the effect that the natives rushed to the towns because they are economically oppressed on the countryside, and because the farmers repress and grind them down by paying starvation wages. I want to protest most strongly against it. People who make that kind of complaint are not acquainted with the method of life of the native, and with conditions on the countryside. The native workers on the farms are not people that are starved. There are two classes of workmen on the farm: the first is those who work for wages, and the second is those who do not work for wages, but who are entitled to sow, and to graze stock on the farm in return for working for the farmer for three or six months. They are the class that is known as squatters. I should like to enlarge on this aspect of the matter, and, therefore, I should like to ask the Minister whether I may move the adjournment of the debate because it is already late.</p>

<p>I first want to deal with a group known as squatters. This type is much better off than the natives in the locations or in the native territories. He usually gets more ground than what he and his children can properly work. He gets the right to graze a certain number of cattle and small stock on the farm, and still further assistance from the farmer. These squatters are usually better off on the farm of a farmer than the natives in the locations and the native territories. The other class is those who work for wages. Here I also want to enquire into the position he occupies. He earns from &#x00A3;1 10s. to &#x00A3;2 a month plus rations, and this forsooth is the labour which is ground down and receives starvation wages. People who make such statements have not the least appreciation of the method of life of the native. Those wages are quite adequate to provide for the needs of the native. As the Minister of Lands has already shown on a former occasion, the native in this respect is quite different to the European. The demands he makes and his needs differ as the heavens from those of the white man. I do not reproach the native. He only works until he has enough to supply his needs for a certain time; that is a characteristic which cannot be contradicted. If we pay him &#x00A3;2 for his labour, then he only works until he thinks he has earned enough for his needs, and then he goes to rest. What will be the result if we pay him &#x00A3;5 a month&#x003F; He will only go and rest all the sooner. The only difference will be that he will merely work three months instead of possibly nine months.</p>

<speech by="#strydom">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRYDOM</person>:</from>

<p>At the adjournment I was endeavouring to show that the ordinary native labourer working for a wage on the farm only works so long and so much as is necessary to provide for his needs. The same applies to the other class of labourers, viz., the squatter. We find in some cases that the squatter, according to the contract with his master, sometimes has to work for nine months in the year, but in most cases the squatter is only obliged to do six months&#x2019; work for his master. We find that just as in the case of the labourer who works for wages, that after the six months are ended he refuses absolutely to work for his master for wages or on another farm. I can speak in this matter from experience because, in my own case, I find that natives living on adjoining farms absolutely refuse, after they have worked for six months for their master, to hire themselves to me or any other farmer in the vicinity. They elect to squat there for the rest of the year to rest, as they call it. Now someone will ask why that is so. Simply because <span class="col_1393-1394" refersTo="page_0767"/>the native cannot see the necessity of it. When a native has reached thirty to forty bags of maize, then it is enough for the rest of the year, and he cannot understand why he should work for the rest of the year. I do not say this as a reproach. I only state the fact that the native&#x2019;s whole method of life is different to ours, and that he is fairly treated by the farmer. He lives, as an hon. member has remarked, easier than we do. There is, therefore, no question of the native being forced by his economic circumstances on the countryside to trek to the towns. I think that it is nothing else but a slander of the farmers, and I hope that we, at any rate in this House, will hear no more of that. Enough accusations have already been made as if the farmer were only out to exploit the native. There are people, and apparently also some members of the House, who are very concerned about the welfare of the natives, more than about the welfare and the distress of the white man in South Africa. It is those people who publish the statements that the native is downtrodden by the Europeans, such as we had to listen to a few days ago from the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron), who said that we must first consider whether we are going to treat the natives as dogs or human beings. Hoes the hon. member possibly wish to create the impression that in South Africa one or other section of the population treats the natives like dogs&#x003F; If it is so, will the hon. member say which section it is. May I ask him whether it is the farmers in the neighbourhood of his constituency, or whether it is in the towns where the native is treated in that way&#x003F; May I ask the hon. member for East London (North) whether he personally treats his natives differently to the farmers in his neighbourhood&#x003F; I do not believe that the hon. member, or any other person, whatever part of society they may belong to, treats the native differently to what the ordinary man does. Why then must we always hear those charges&#x003F; It looks as if it is people who preach a doctrine in public, but practise a different doctrine.</p>

<p>No, particularly members opposite. They are the people who make so many speeches, but only with the object of catching votes and recommending themselves to the native, instead of looking after the real interests of the native. Anyone who creates the impression in the House that the native is downtrodden by the European is not a real friend of the native, because he teaches the native to regard the white man as his enemy. If we regard the treatment of the native by the European in the right perspective, we cannot but conclude that the white man has always hitherto been the friend of the native. Now I should like to come to the segregation policy in the Bill. When we look at it we must enquire whether it is tenacious legislation, legislation which will temporarily get us out of the difficulty, or that we are drafting legislation which will form the basis to build up in future our relations towards the native. As the hon. member (Mr. Nicholls) has done, I just want to ask what we can expect in future from legislation of this kind. If we are actually going to apply the principle of segregation, are we not possibly, with the location on the boundaries of the towns, laying the basis for big native towns which will arise alongside the European towns&#x003F; If we do not have white towns in the future of 200,000 or 300,000 or 500,000 inhabitants, and have a native town with a like or larger number of natives, how then will it influence the position of the white town&#x003F; Are we to regard native towns like that as only existing to provide the white towns with labour, or as permanent towns which are permanently occupied by natives&#x003F; Is it really necessary for the carrying on of the industries in our towns to have a native town with just as many inhabitants as the white towns&#x003F; It has been said that we can only build up the industries in South Africa on the cheap labour of natives. It may be so, or not, but it seems to me that the future of our industries is very dark if we can only extend them by cheap weak hordes of labourers. If the industries of South Africa cannot supply work to the thousands and thousands of white labourers in our country, I ask myself whether it is worth while building up our industries on the weak black labour. We shall always have poor whites in South Africa, and I think instead of making it easy for the native to trek to the towns, we ought rather to lay down a fixed policy to find a place for the poor whites who are not suited to agriculture&#x2014;and there are some of them that are not so suited&#x2014;in the growing industries. If it is possible to use white labour in the towns in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, then we can also use, our white labourers in our towns. I personally should like to see the native constantly being decreased in the town, and in proportion as the natives diminish to employ the white workers in the industries in the towns. That is why we deplore that the Minister does not consider it possible to grant the local board more and fuller powers to restrict and control the residence of natives in their areas; and not only to restrict, but slowly to reduce the number of natives, so that if we cannot enforce total segregation in South Africa, we shall at least be able to introduce segregation in the towns. Inasmuch as the towns are also in future going to be the cultural centres of the country, it is the more desirable that we should in the distant future apply total segregation. It is generally admitted, rightly or wrongly, that total segregation is no longer possible, not even in the towns. I allege that it is actually possible in the towns, and, therefore, I should like the local board to be given the power to apply it there as much as possible.</p>

<p>I think that in dealing with this amending Bill we should ask ourselves the question what gave rise to it, and what was the object of the principal Act, to be able to judge whether this amending Bill is necessary and whether the amendments therein proposed will effect the object of the <span class="col_1395-1396" refersTo="page_0768"/>principal Act. To me it seems to be a question of our having to decide whether the Bill is necessary, and whether it will attain the object for which it was introduced. On the introduction of the Bill which became the principal Act in 1923, the Leader of the present Opposition, Gen. Smuts, spoke as follows. He said that the influx of natives into the towns during recent years had increased, and that it had had sad results both for the Europeans and for the natives. The Bill which he was then introducing would try to separate the native, and keep him out of the towns, and to uplift him. The principal Act of 1923 was based on these two main objects, viz., the segregation of the natives in the towns and the uplift of the natives. Fortunately these two aims are of such a nature that the attainment of one practically means the attainment of the other as well. If we separate the native, if we give them good houses, and we put them under proper control, it will do them good, and we are thereby helping them on. Although that principal Act has done considerable good, it became plain that it had not attained its object. There were shortcomings, and the Bill was defective in certain respects. To support this proposition of mine I want to refer hon. members to the second report of the Select Committee on Native Affairs, which sat in connection with this Bill. I find there that the delegate from Johannesburg said: &#x201C;There is no law to restrict the streaming of natives into the towns.&#x201D; He further said: &#x201C;They become inhabitants of the slums, and hon. members know what the slums of Johannesburg and other big cities are.&#x201D; That is one of the things in which the principal Act was defective. On page 4 we find a further important quotation. Here a comparison is made between the amending Act and the principal Act and Mr. Ballenden, the representative from Johannesburg, states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We hope by means of this Bill to stop the influx and catch up with our building &#x2026; Take the case of a back yard house with 20 families. They are licensed to house these by name. Five of these families go away and we are relieved to the extent of five houses because these five families cannot be replaced by another five families from outside. At the present moment this wastage is replaced continuously. &#x2026; In order to get Johannesburg proclaimed at the present rate we are going it will take us another ten years and at an additional cost of from &#x00A3;500,000 to &#x00A3;800,000, whereby by amending the Act we can avoid that unnecessary expenditure.</block>

<p>I think it must be clear from what I have quoted that the principal Act was defective in this respect and that the amending Bill will make provision in that regard. This all refers to Clause 3, and trading with natives in urban areas. It is clear to me that the substitution for Section 5 of the principal Act of Clause 4 of this Bill will go very far to improve the position, and I particularly want to mention Clause 6 (a). If any sensible person wants to empty a tank then he first closes off the supply to the tank before he opens the tap. We cannot think of reaching this ideal and of removing superfluous natives from the towns if we do not first stop the influx. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) said that the native would not be forced by legislation of this kind into the locations, and that we cannot prevent the crowding in the slums, because the rent in the locations was too high. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Bowen) also said that the natives would not go to the locations because the expenses of each person would be much more there. What then about the natives that are already in the locations&#x003F; I again refer to that report and to the evidence of a certain Ballenden from Johannesburg. He gives the reason why natives will not go to the locations, and he also gives a complete reply to the theory of the hon. member for Yeoville. The reason why the natives choose the slums is because the locations are under direct control, while that is not the case in the slums, and in the slums the natives have a source of income in the illicit liquor traffic, and in other ways that I do not want to mention here. He goes further and says that house rent in the slums is considerably higher than in the locations. I think that this matter is not insoluble if we do not ourselves put difficulties in the way, and if hon. members do not use certain expressions, such as have been used in this House, which arouse suspicion on the part of the native against the white than, but when we do our best to do justice to the European and the native, then the matter will not be insoluble at all. Clause 3 grants certain powers to the town council to exercise control. Clause 11 deals with the question of dancing halls, and Clause 16 to that of the curfew. It is nothing else but the logical application of the principle of segregation. This may also possibly be objected to, but I can again refer hon. members to the report I have already quoted. It is alleged there that the well-intentioned natives are in favour of it. The position will be that such provisions will uplift the natives, as the Prime Minister said in 1923. I, personally, as a Free Stater, grew up with, not under, the curfew. It seems to me that segregation is useless if we segregate the native but allow him to wander about the whole night in the European areas. I now come to another point, viz., the uplift of the native. I have already shown in the beginning that the matter works automatically. If we control the native well then we also uplift him. We then take him out of the slums, and we heard last year what the slums are like. We are told here of the terrible evils that prevail in the slums, and I am astonished to find objections by those very members against Clause 15, which refers to the destruction of the houses of natives in the slums. The hon. member for Cathcart (Mr. van Coller) spoke of the poor native whose house would be burnt down. I read that Clause <span class="col_1397-1398" refersTo="page_0769"/>in this way: that when it is found that a native&#x2019;s residence is uninhabitable or infected, then the town council have the right to burn it down. But, in addition, it is provided clearly that this takes place&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that when giving such notice the local authority shall offer to every such occupant other adequate housing accommodation in the same or any other location or native village under its control.</block>

<p>What objection can there he to that&#x003F; But I will go further, the introduction of this amending Bill and the inclusion of Clause 15 are intended, according to the Minister&#x2019;s statement, to also remedy conditions in Cape Town. I can quite imagine that the Minister intended this last year, when the House resounded with the speeches of hon. members opposite about the terrible conditions in the Cape Town slums. He thought he could satisfy hon. members, but further complaints are now coming from the opposite side. Are they the same members&#x003F; Yes, they are the same members, but it is another session. I should like to proceed to another point which arose after the introduction of the principal Act and for which no provision is made, viz., for the rush into the locations. If we look at the report again, and compare the evidence of the Transvaal and Free State representatives then we find this. While the Transvaal representatives were concerned about the rush of the natives to the towns and villages, we find that in an old Free State Town like Bloemfontein, they are more concerned about the rush to the locations. It is well here to refer to the evidence of Mr. Franklin which appears on pages 11, 12 and 13 of the report. I am only quoting from page 13. He says there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have at the present moment unemployed and unemployable natives to the number of at least 1,000 adults who are residing in the location&#x2014;people who come to Bloemfontein in the expectation of obtaining employment from residents of the town as domestic servants and business and industrial employees. There is opportunity as indicated by our registration system at the present moment for employment of approximately 6,000 natives by the Europeans in Bloemfontein, but at present we have surplus and redundant natives in the locations numbering at least 1,000. These people cannot live except by battening on the natives in the location who are actually in employment. The undue concentration in the locations of unemployed and unemployable natives will in time make for trouble as between the white man and the native. It is creating a dangerous situation. There are explosive possibilities, and when you have a large number of unemployed natives it makes for vice, prostitution and a large increase in drunkenness. This is a powder magazine, which a match dropped by a, careless agitator is apt to explode at any time. Bloemfontein has the largest native location in South Africa and on account of the amenities and advantages which Bloemfontein offers its natives this population is increasing at an abnormal rate. We feel that unless something is done to check this influx we are building up the possibility of a menace to the European population and a dangerous situation for the old time residents of the location.</block>

<p>I know the Minister made provision in one clause to remove unemployed and undesirable natives from the locations. But I find nothing to enable town councils to control the position. I know that the farmers in Bloemfontein and roundabout the district of Bloemfontein complained that they cannot get enough work people. The farmers have too little labour, and the town council complains about unemployment in the locations. When the Minister imposes certain obligations on the towns and villages he must also give them the necessary power to exercise control so that the locations shall not become a hotbed for agitators, owing to the number of unemployed natives wandering about there. The matter is, I think, very important, and a great question for our national existence, when we think what the position of the native is to-day. They are in a transition period. I almost said in a period of ferment, and there is no time for delay, and when hon. members opposite say that they agree with the principle of the Bill, I cannot see why it should go to a select committee. If they are dissatisfied with a particular clause, then they can surely move an amendment in committee, just as I now want to speak about something I do not agree with. I am now speaking as a Free Stater and I am opposed to the grant of trading licences to natives in the locations. I was not here last Thursday, but I read the speech of the hon. member for Frankfort (Mr. Wessels). I hope that he was wrongly reported, because he said a few things which I cannot at all agree with. He asked what objection we could have to the grant of trading licences in the locations when we allow the natives to, themselves, have shops in the villages.</p>

<p>There are native shops in my village as well. It is the ordinary white traders that have licences, and then they have shops adjoining for natives. It is not a native business. This merely shows us the whole spirit of the Free State. We would like the native to be served by someone of his own race and in his own language, but there is a great distinction between this action and the granting of the trading licence in the location. I do not want to repeat what other members have said on this because I agree with them. I only want to say that we have to do with a tradition in the Free State. In the past the Free State has only granted trading licences to Europeans. Hon. members have asked whether the Free State is not in the Union. Yes, the Free State is in the Union, but because it has maintained that tradition it is still <span class="col_1399-1400" refersTo="page_0770"/>the Free State. From the standpoint of a white South Africa the Free State is the flower of the Union. We would like to co-operate, but what we feel is that while we stood in the past as a province that only issued licences to Europeans, and if we are now to resolve that licences can also be given to natives in locations, then we are actually making a native reserve of the location. Possibly it makes no difference in the Cape Province, Transvaal and Natal. If you cross the Vaal River, then you find the Indian shopkeeper, and the same applies to Natal and the Cape Province. These provinces are surrendering no principle. We in the Free State have actually to sacrifice a principle, and if we are now to give licences to the native in the location then it will turn out that we shall now also have to give freehold title. We are opposed to this.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MUNNIK</person>:</from>

<p>I only want to express the opinion of the constituency which I represent. The principle of the Bill before the House this evening I think is one which we all endorse. But whether it is advisable, as the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) said, at this stage to bring up this question of the most important portion of the segregation question dealing with the segregation of the natives in the towns&#x2014;whether it is advisable to bring this up at the present juncture, before the whole native Bill is dealt with, is a question which this House must decide. I feel in regard to this question that it is probably the most important question dealing with segregation with which we have to deal. We are practically in the position of dealing with all amending legislation since 1913, when the hon. the Prime Minister took up a definite attitude upon that, question. Subsequent to that we had amending legislation on this segregation Bill passing through all stages, and this evening we have the Minister of Native Affairs bringing up this measure before us, and taking practical measures to control segregation so far as the towns are concerned. He takes very drastic steps to prevent the native from drifting into the towns, and creating slum areas. We are told this evening that if we take further steps to carry out a further segregation policy of preventing the native from trading in the white man&#x2019;s area, that we shall then be interfering with the rights of the natives. I think the House will have to decide whether it was ever the intention when this Bill originally merged from its infancy in 1913, of the legislature to consider native locations in the vicinity of urban areas as locations coming within the true terms of the word. I think that is the only question upon which I need address the House this evening. The Prime Minister has told us that the Beaumont Commission made provision in connection with native locations to the effect that those native locations are to hold for the next 50 years, so far as we are concerned. My hon. friend, the member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) I think is in agreement with that commission&#x2019;s report. He might think that the locations are too small, but I do not think he has ever suggested that these locations shall be extended towards the industrial areas, where they are very often divided by a street, so far as the industrial areas are concerned. I do not know whether the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) was very clear on the matter, but I take it he spoke the opinion of Natal, and the hon. member for Roodepoort (Col. Stallard) was very clear, so far as the Transvaal is concerned, in regard to the opinion in the north. I hope the hon. the Minister, at this stage, will take into consideration the fact that there is very serious opinion in this House on both sides of this House, with regard to the question of the trading of natives inside urban areas. I do not think any member of this House wants to take away the rights of the native that are due to him, but I think every member of the House objects to the white man&#x2019;s area, I won&#x2019;t say, being polluted, but being interfered with, by the over running of natives. I take it the principle underlying the whole of the segregation policy is that the white man shall be the only judge, and he will decide what is going on inside the white areas. I hope that the Minister in charge of this Bill will consider this question very seriously. I am speaking to-night on behalf of my own constituency, of one section of the Union which feels very strongly upon this question. I recognize that the Bill, as it stands now, in passing the House before the second reading, the principle will be accepted, so far as the House is concerned, and it will not be altered before the second reading. I hope the Minister will take that question very seriously into consideration. Whatever my feelings are, sitting on this side of the House, I shall respond to the crack of the whip most loyally. When the whip cracks, as a solid party man, I shall vote as I am told to do, and that is what hon. members on the other side of the House will do, as well as hon. members on this side of the House. That is the feeling of the majority of this House, so far as the two northern provinces are concerned, and also a large number of the other provinces. I hope the Minister will take that into consideration before he calls upon us to vote on this measure.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARES</person>:</from>

<p>One realizes that in any law put into force by this House, its deficiencies can only be revealed when the Act is applied. It is only reasonable to suppose that any amendments proposed might be accepted as being intended to rectify the deficiencies. We have heard a good deal from this side of the House and from the other side of the House; we have heard appeals from this side of the House, particularly asking the Minister to allow the Bill to go to a select committee. I feel that, in drafting a Bill of this nature, it is naturally exceedingly difficult to draft it in such a manner as will meet the desires and the requirements of all parts of the country. In connection with the present Bill, judging from the remarks that have fallen from hon. members on both sides of the House, it would appear as if it were drafted mainly in the interests of, or to meet the wishes of, Johannesburg, and <span class="col_1401-1402" refersTo="page_0771"/>perhaps, to a certain extent, of Durban. In suggesting to the Minister that it would be advisable to allow this Bill to go to a select committee, may I venture to suggest that the opinions of men who had been superintendents of locations in some of the largest centres, especially in the Cape Province, and the opinions of responsible natives, not agitators, might be well worth having. If the Minister agreed to do that, he would, to a large extent, allay any feeling there might be amongst those principally affected by the Bill, through no consideration being given them, and this being looked upon as a further repressive measure. There are one or two points which demand some explanation from the Minister. First it is suggested that the entry of natives into proclaimed areas should be controlled. This, in some cases, perhaps even in many, might be quite feasible, but there are many cases in which it would be difficult to control the entry of these people to the location. In section 4, the Minister proposes to do something which, on the face of it, appears to a certain extent to trespass on the province of the provincial councils for it means the extension of the municipal boundaries which is a question for provincial councils. In the division I represent there are two municipalities. One is purely residential and immediately adjoining it is a large extent of vacant ground belonging to a land company. The acquisition of that ground by the Port Elizabeth municipality would be a perfectly easy matter and I can imagine the consternation of the people in this very fine suburb if the Port Elizabeth municipality acquired the adjoining land and wanted to put a location there. Another question concerns section 5 which requires that it is necessary for a female to have a father or a husband living in a proclaimed area before she is allowed to live there. In locations near large towns there are many unattached female natives employed in domestic service whose employers cannot provide them with sleeping accommodation. Are they to be debarred from residing in the locations&#x003F; As to the registration of those who are not under a contract of service, I can easily imagine that there are many natives who, while being under no contract of service, still have an honest means of obtaining a livelihood. Are they also to be turned out of the locations unless they are in the service of some individual&#x003F; There are some natives who are quite capable of earning an honest living without being in the service of any man. What is exercising the minds of some hon. members, especially those from the Free State, is the question of natives having the right to trade. I understood that the whole of the Free State was solid for complete segregation, but after listening to the speeches of members from that province, I have come to the conclusion that they are only partially for segregation. One hon. member said he would object to natives having the right to trade in what is a white man&#x2019;s area. I understand, however, that any area set aside by a local authority for native occupation was outside the white man&#x2019;s area. I fail therefore to see how the hon. member can describe that as the white man&#x2019;s area. In the Port Elizabeth native location we have quite a number of white traders, but I am not aware whether there are any native traders, although I do not think that they would be debarred by the local authority if they applied for a licence. Is it intended that the white traders already established there and who have spent money in erecting buildings on land hired from the municipality should be expelled from that area&#x003F; That would be a very serious matter as far as we are concerned. In our location there is no privately owned property, the whole location being vested in the municipality in the interests of the native.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Our location was originally a Government location. Then it was handed over to the town, and I think prior to that some of these white traders established themselves there. I do not think the Minister would be prepared to commit what would be an injustice to these people. Another matter which rather exercises my mind is this. It is very easy for us to talk about shifting these people, but where are we going to send them&#x003F; In a large number of urban centres, especially the bigger ones in the Cape Province, the second or even the third generation of natives have been born in towns and lost all connection with tribal life. If they are unemployed for a long time, they are liable to expulsion from that area, but where are they to go&#x003F; Are they to become vagabonds and wanderers over the face of the earth&#x003F; I think enough has been said to show the necessity of the Bill going to select committee. The hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) said that the crack of the Government whip drives hon. members opposite to vote as they are told, irrespective of their convictions. But I thought this was being treated as a non-party matter. For instance, we know there is a great difference of opinion between members from the Transvaal, the Orange Free State and Natal, who do not look upon this matter in the same light as the members from the Cape Province. I thought we were at perfect liberty to ignore the party whip. With regard to the feelings of hon. members from the Free State not allowing natives to trade, for the life of me I cannot imagine why; and is only the white man to be allowed to trade&#x003F; If they are firm on that, they ought to ask the Minister to allow the matter to go to a select committee, but I am afraid, after hearing the hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik)), he would not have the courage to do so. Perhaps, after the very earnest appeals which have been made purely in the firm conviction that nothing but good could come from sending it to a select committee, I hope the Minister will see his way to do what has been asked for by many hon. members <span class="col_1403-1404" refersTo="page_0772"/>from this side, and allow it to go to a select committee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The debate on this Bill has ranged over a very wide field, in which important matters have been discussed, which, however, do not fall within the purview of the Bill. I think it would be impossible for either the House or any select committee which it may appoint to deal adequately with many of the questions which have been raised; for instance, I do not think any hon. member believes for a moment that the economic, social and industrial conditions of the natives could be adequately dealt with by any select committee that may be appointed. These are great questions which there may be some other means of dealing with, but certainly not by a select committee, or a committee of this House dealing with the Bill. Nor do I think we can enter upon the question raised by the hon. member for Roodepoort (Col Stallard). I want to say here that I consider some of the hon. member&#x2019;s colleagues have not been quite fair with regard to his proposition. As I understand the hon. member, his idea is that the number of natives should be decreased in the urban areas, and not sent away without any place for them to go to, but provision should be made in the countryside where these natives could be settled and removed to, which, I think, is a perfectly fair proposition to put forward. The hon. member must, however, realize that that involves a very intricate and difficult question which it is impossible for the House or a select committee to deal with. In the first place, how is he going to determine, if he is going to deport or repatriate natives, which natives are to be deported or repatriated&#x003F; It would entail that machinery would have to be put up by which quotas could be established for every industry in urban areas, and the result would be that each industry would be told it would be entitled to employ so many natives and no more, and the natives in employment above that number would have to go. There is provision in the Bill to deal with those who are not in employment. He wants to go further and to repatriate those who are in employment. But there is another difficulty. I can assure the hon. member that the places available in the native areas is certainly not so great as he has been led to believe or as he stated in the House. It is true every opportunity is taken of increasing the areas set apart for natives, but this would entail that we are going to enter on this question on a large scale&#x2014;there will be the question of the lands which have to be alloted, and legislation is already pending with regard to native lands. We have to deal with this when the Bills to be introduced by the Prime Minister are dealt with; so I do not think we can now enter upon these largo questions. Let me point out to hon. members that the intention of this Bill is merely to deal with certain difficulties which urban authorities have had to deal with since the original Act came into force, and which are urgently waiting for solution. We have introduced this Bill to deal with these special points of administration which are urgently required to be dealt with now, and for that reason I do not think we can enter on the economic and repatriation questions which have been suggested. Let us confine ourselves to the matter before the House at the present time&#x2014;to ease the burden cast on urban authorities by the Act of 1923, and very heavy burdens have been put on local authorities. Where they find these heavy burdens have been put on local authorities. Where they find these burdens have become unnecessarily irksome hon. members should not seek to hamper this Bill with other very important matters, but which can be dealt with in other ways than by setting up a select committee or introducing amendments dealing with these matters under this Bill. Let me deal briefly with the question of letting this Bill go to a select committee. It has already been before a select committee, which has taken evidence on all the most important points. The only matters which are new and introduced into this Bill are two. The first is the power given to the Governor-General under one sub-section, on the request of a local authority, to issue a proclamation prohibiting natives entering an urban area, on such conditions as may be imposed. The other point is the control of meetings within the urban areas. There are no other matters which were not before the select committee.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>We had a select committee. It went into the question, and if it refused to hear the natives on those points, it should not have reported the Bill. I submit that there are no questions dealt with in this Bill on which it is necessary <span class="col_1405-1406" refersTo="page_0773"/>to go to select committee. The matters dealt with in the Bill are perfectly straightforward. They are matters which have been dealt with under the Act of 1923, and the Bill provides for altering the Act of 1923 to a certain extent. There is no foundation for any of the talk of repressive legislation in connection with this Bill. I want to say to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth that so far as the section dealing with trading licences is concerned, that section merely provides that where municipalities refuse to grant licences to natives in locations the Minister will be able to override such decisions on the part of municipalities. This does not affect the existing rights of any people in locations. These points can very easily be dealt with in committee. Several hon. members have referred to Section 4, but when we are in committee I shall be prepared to consider amendments to meet objections of hon. members on the other side of the House. I have already discussed the question of this clause, and I shall be prepared to move for the amendment of Clause 4 so as to provide that an area acquired by a municipality in that of another local authority shall come under the jurisdiction of the acquiring municipality only with the consent of the Administrator on such terms as he may agree to. The result of that will be that where there is a conflict between local authorities, the Administrator will bring them together and decide which of them is unreasonable. It leaves the door open to negotiation, and in this way the jursidiction of the provincial councils will be acknowledged.</p>

<p>*I just want to say a few words in connection with the trading licences in the locations. We shall be able to debate the matter more fully in committee, but I just want beforehand to point out to hon. members that they have a completely wrong view about the clause. I want to refer hon. members to the original section in the Act, Section No. 22. If they refer to that they will find that the idea of natives trading in the locations is actually fully comprised in the original Act, because Section 2 lays down that an urban local board that exercises supervision over a location, or native township, can let plots in the locations or native townships for shops or for business purposes. The section further provides, inter alia, that they can prohibit hawking, and also that no plot may be let to anyone else than a native&#x2014; that is said in the Act&#x2014;; no one else shall be employed in such a shop which is let for trade purposes except natives. The intention of the principal Act was therefore quite certain that the natives should have a chance of trading in the locations.</p>

<p>The municipalities were given the power, but hon. members will understand that the powers which were given to the municipalities were not only given to be read on paper, but also for them to be used. I just want to point out that this Section 22 in the Act acknowledged the right of natives to trade, and it is one of the great grievances of the natives that when the right was given to them in the past, the right granted them in the principal Act, it has never yet been given to them. To meet the state of affairs this provision has been amended so that where a municipality refuses to give natives the right, the Minister can intervene and say that such a right must be granted. Hon. members must, however, well understand, that it is not a case of the Minister being appointed a court of appeal from the judgments of municipalities. That is not the intention at all, but the intention is that where a municipality refuses to give any licence to a native for the reason that he is a native the Minister can say that the natives must be allowed to trade, and it appears to be a reasonable proposition. The natives are there, the Europeans are not allowed to trade there, but I go further and say that in the Bloemfontein location the natives have already obtained the right to hawk there, and they are selling things there. About 70 licences have been issued to natives there. It is, however, also a fact that the natives who have a district licence are permitted to trade in the location as well, and that was not the intention of the principal Act.</p>

<p>Yes, the Europeans have small shops there round about the locations. They profit by them, and why should not the natives have them&#x003F; Why should they not have the right to trade with their own people&#x003F; We must consider the feelings of the natives in the matter. They got the right of trading in the Act. Take, e.g., the Bloemfontein location. The hawkers are allowed to trade, but a man may not have a shop there, not even on his own plot, but anyone who does not belong there at all can go about trading. Therefore we have to take action in this connection, and the natives think that it will be an indication of our intentions with them, whether we are honest with them in connection with segregation. I think hon. members must think very seriously before they decide to oppose this provision. There would be no necessity for this clause if it were not that the municipalities in the past were unreasonable in certain respects, and refused trading licences when they could very justly be claimed. I only want to say that it is not intended that any native whatsoever can get a licence. A municipality has the right of making the strictest regulations possible, to see that the best natives get the right in the locations, and they can make regulations to provide against any abuse of natives in the locations being committed by Europeans. They can, e.g., make regulations about the inspection of books, so that they can go into these things. The natives do not <span class="col_1407-1408" refersTo="page_0774"/>wish anyone simply to get a licence. I think we can go into the matter more fully in committee, and also into a number of other points raised by hon. members.</p>

<p>The general election! I wish to remind him that we asked him to let us know as early as possible what the financial position is, and I told him that the public was somewhat perturbed as to the position. In spite of that, however, we are told nothing, and I am rather disappointed. On the last occasion there was no urgent request that the Minister should tell es what the position was because we knew that the finances were perfectly sound, and there was likely to be a credit balance, but that is not likely to happen this year, and traffic is falling. Therefore we expected to have something more than the very few words uttered by the Minister. People are puzzled at the different figures which are published regarding railway finances. We find for example, according to the figures published in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report that the revenue for 1929-&#x2019;30 was &#x00A3;30,000,000, and the expenditure &#x00A3;30,054,000. The general manager&#x2019;s figures, however, differ from these by no less than &#x00A3;2,000,000, and they also differ from the monthly statement published in the &#x201C;Government Gazette.&#x201D; The public, naturally, will depend on the latter, and at the end of the year they add them up only to discover that the general manager in his annual report differs from his monthly figures by &#x00A3;2,000,000. The public become anxious, and the Minister should put things right by telling us what the financial position really is. In any case, the position is very misleading. I do not suggest that there is anything wrong with the figures, but the system is very cumbersome, is unlike the method adopted by any Government department, and it is impossible for the ordinary man to see what the position really is. We have urged on many occasions that these accounts should be simplified and set out in the style of ordinary accounts, so that members of the public can follow them. According to the estimates the expenditure for 1929-&#x2019;30 was &#x00A3;30,181,000, and for 1930-&#x2019;31 &#x00A3;30,940,000, or an increase for the coming year of &#x00A3;759,000. We find there are increases under every head as far as traffic and running expenses go, with the exception of a permanent way on which there is a diminution of &#x00A3;106,000. Year after year we have been speaking about this and urging the Minister to spend more money on this particular item&#x2014;if that should be necessary&#x2014;to make the railways safer for the travelling public. We have had cases in which there have been enquiries into railway accidents, and the courts have found members of the running staff liable for them, but according to the reports from outside sources some of these accidents were due to the permanent way. There should be a full enquiry so as to satisfy the general public. There is a large body of the public holding the opinion that the permanent way is not what is should be.</p>

<p>I have a newspaper cutting reporting an enquiry into the circumstances attending a derailment on the Piet Retief-Paul Pietersburg line, which discloses the fact that the derailment was due to the unsound condition of the sleepers permitting the road to spread under the train. Relaying operations over this section have been in hand for some time, but according to the report the gangs had not reached that part of the line where the accident occurred. <span class="col_1411-1412" refersTo="page_0776"/>All this must surely go to show that the permanent way is not in such a sound condition as we are told it is. I say again we are not able to judge, of course, on this point, but the idea is prevalent that the permanent way is not as sound as it should be. Every official of the Railway Department in the Sevenoaks disaster held very strongly that there was nothing wrong with the permanent way, but the Board of Trade instituted a thorough enquiry by men from outside, which found that the permanent way was not properly built and at the lower foundation had deteriorated, and therefore could not carry the great weight of the heavy engines at great speed. Surely the Minister could institute an enquiry into this matter. Let him institute an independent enquiry.</p>

<p>So had the railway company in England, but notwithstanding that the enquiry came to a different result from that of the railway engineers. There are a few financial points to which even, at this stage, we should refer so that the Minister may feel the time has arrived when the fullest information should be given. The capital value of our railways, harbours and steamships is &#x00A3;160,000,000, and on &#x00A3;150,000,000 interest is payable. Railways, I think we must admit, are a vanishing asset. Year by year certain sections of the line prove to be unpayable. The Minister has in mind, I am sure, to take up one or other of the unpayable lines. We have some taken up already, and I understand, others are to be taken up soon; I am not officially informed so. We have, it is quite true, a Renewals Fund which we are using, but I want to impress on the Minister the necessity of giving the closest attention to whether a sinking fund should not be established. We have voted &#x00A3;30,000,000 already to the Renewals Fund. When the revolution takes place in traffic, we find it necessary even to increase year by year what we have already voted. Would it not be better to vote less for that fund, and establish a strong sinking fund&#x003F; We would find that the position when the worst takes place and we have to uplift these lines would be easier in finance. We pay at present, by way of interest, just on &#x00A3;6,000,000, but the amount necessary from gross revenue to meet current expenditure is still unnecessarily high. In 1912 it was 65 per cent.; in the abnormal period of 1918-&#x2019;22 it rose to 82.7 per cent.; in 1924 it was 74 per cent., and in 1928, 79.83 per cent. It is quite true it has come down to 77.8 per cent., but still it is abnormally high compared to 1924. We find our branch lines, grain elevators and dry docks in the position that they can never be expected to pay as a whole. The dry docks and elevators certainly never will pay, and some branch lines are a continual loss&#x2014;on nine lines there is a loss of &#x00A3;369,000, and since 1923-&#x2019;24 this loss has increased. On the Port-Elizabeth-Avontuur line since 1924, revenue has fallen by &#x00A3;7,050 and expenditure increased by &#x00A3;22,900. On grain elevators, the loss has been &#x00A3;23,800 in five years, and on the dry dock in Durban, the annual loss has been from &#x00A3;70,000 to &#x00A3;80,000, while at Cape Town the loss has been from &#x00A3;7,000 to &#x00A3;10,000. These we can never hope to pay, and therefore we must make provision for them. When we come to the personnel, it numbers about 100,000 persons receiving from 15&#x00BD; to 16 millions by way of salary. In five years the staff increased by 14,202, or 16.75 per cent. and wages by &#x00A3;3,000,000 or 24.51 per cent. Even last year wages increased by &#x00A3;250,000.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I ask the Minister. I remember his reply when he sat on this side&#x2014; I am not going to repeat it. How is he going to meet the serious falling-off in revenue&#x003F; It is perfectly certain he cannot reduce wages or staff, in either case it will be economically unsound, and I do not think he is going back on all his promises of the past. He is also not able to increase his tariffs because they are from three to 140 per cent. above pre-war,&#x2014;certainly they are still above the normal. We feel the position is rather he should reduce his tariff so as to bring about the proper development of all the resources of the country. Will the Minister tell us what his policy is&#x003F; Unless he takes into his confidence we are entirely at sea. We are entitled to know. I want to ask him not to allow the present position to continue, when people, in spite of what the Minister may say, are becoming very nervous of the position on our railways. They feel that many things are being done which should not be done, and that many things should be done in a different way. The Minister told us the other day that they never order any goods without asking for tenders except rails and fish plates. I find that last year two engines were ordered without a tender being called for. I find that from the auditor-general&#x2019;s report, and a sum of no less than &#x00A3;132,437 was sacrificed merely for early delivery of locomotives and trucks, and so on. Then there was a wheel lathe which was ordered on the 3rd of January, 1927, and arrived on the 14th September, 1928. It cost &#x00A3;2,694, and this amount was lying idle for about two years. Then, if the Minister will turn to page 62 of the auditor-general&#x2019;s report, he will find that large quantities of material ordered for <span class="col_1413-1414" refersTo="page_0777"/>the construction of new rolling stock, were on hand for considerable periods before being utilized, having been ordered earlier than was necessary, resulting in a loss of interest on the capital expenditure involved. It further appears that the time schedules used in connection with the ordering were not adequate for the purposes for which they were designed. As instances where material has been on hand for a considerable time, prior to its being actually required, the following concrete cases are quoted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Construction of nine third-class and van suburban coaches at Uitenhage. My inspector reported that paints and varnishes, etc., were purchased long before they were needed, and also, for example, that 324 accumulator cells, costing &#x00A3;959, were purchased in July, 1928, and they were still in stores on 17th May, 1929.</block>

<p>Large sums of money have been lying idle. Money has been spent, and nothing has been received. No interest has been gained, and the work has not been completed in time. Then we find that, through ordering defective engines, the administration is losing very heavily. There are examples on pages 62 and 63. We find here that ten Maffei articulated &#x201C;U&#x201D; type engines, capital cost, &#x00A3;121,413, were out of service 801 days in 1927-&#x2019;28, the year in which they were placed in service, and 1,323 days in 1928-&#x2019;29. The general manager in reply to a note by the auditor-general says that from a traffic point of view it cannot be said that the engines are satisfactory, or that they would ever prove entirely satisfactory. Then again, there are two G.H. engines, capital cost, &#x00A3;29,051. These two locomotives which were placed in service in February, 1928, were out of service in 1928-&#x2019;29 (April, 1928, to March, 1929) for 286 and 267 days respectively. They were completely out of service from August, 1928, to July and August, 1929. A committee, that is, a committee appointed by the administration, after reporting on the responsibility for ordering and for the acceptance of these locomotives, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With regard to the question as to what should be done to enable the administration to obtain the best use from the two class &#x201C;G.H.&#x201D; engines, as the position stands at present, it is not possible for the committee to suggest any line on which the engines can be employed.</block>

<p>And so one could go on, in regard to these engines, but I think I have given sufficient examples to show that there is a certain amount of wasteful expenditure in the service which should be stopped as soon as possible. I give these examples at this present stage to induce the Minister to appreciate that the public, as a whole, really want to know something about the financial position of the railways at the present time. Then, when we turn to the general manager&#x2019;s report, we find that there have been records in passenger trains, in passenger traffic, records in income from carriage of goods and carriage of coal. Strangely enough the moment his report came into circulation, we started receiving reports that traffic was falling, and that every possible class of goods showed a falling off. He also tells us, and this is the reason I am referring to what he said there, that the rolling stock is better man ever it has been before. He tells us that the administration has 2,123 locomotives, 3,758 passenger coaches, and 57,380 trucks. Then we find that, at the same time as he is writing this report, not only is a report spread that the revenue is falling fast, but that the administration is ordering from 30 to 40 locomotives for quick delivery at a cost of about &#x00A3;250,000. When you have this record quantity of lolling stock, you order 30 or 40 locomotives, and also trucks and rolling stock to the value of &#x00A3;800,000, also for quick delivery. Thus, while rolling stock is better than ever before, we have this expenditure upon additional engines and rolling stock, ordered for quick delivery. The Minister will remember that a year or two ago there were two contracts, A and B. A&#x2019;s contract was for a lesser sum, but A could not deliver as quickly as B. B got the contract. After B had got the contract, B wrote for information with regard to the specification, and also wrote for other information. By the time B had got all the information he required, A&#x2019;s contract could have been completed. There is a fetish for quick delivery, and it appears that the department would rather pay large sums of money than make arrangements to obtain goods in a reasonable time. I cannot understand why practically every order is for quick delivery. The administration must know a year before hand what their requirements will be. The general manager is apparently also becoming quite nervous about the financial position. He issues circulars to the staff enjoining the strictest economy. So keen is he that he goes to extraordinary lengths. He reminds his staff by a circular that in revenue the cost of one red pencil equals the haulage of one bag of maize for ten miles; that one pot of glue equals the haulage of one bag of bran (100 lbs.) for two hundred miles; that one pen holder equals the haulage of one bag of fertilizer (200 lbs.) for five miles; that one glass inkpot equals the haulage of one bag of crushed oats (100 lbs.) for 350 miles. Further, that one packet of mixed pins equals the haulage of one bag of fertilizer (100 lbs.) for ten miles; that one gloy brush equals the haulage of one bag of sweet potatoes (120 lbs.) for 22 miles. That one large blotting pad equals the haulage of 1 ton of sand for 100 miles. One small blotting pad equals the haulage of one ton of crushed stone for 27 miles, and that one shorthand notebook equals the haulage of one bag of cement (187 lbs.) for 13 miles.</p>

<p>It is very striking. It shows he anticipates that the only thing to be done is to exercise the strictest economy. Now that took time to work out, and I hope <span class="col_1415-1416" refersTo="page_0778"/>the cost for working out that did not equal the cost of gloy pots and pen holders. I want to appeal to the Minister now. We have wasted more than a year in the dispute between the Railways and the Electricity Commission; it is a year ago since the Select Committee took decided evidence and the matter was discussed in this House. I think the Minister ought to see now that the Commission is not bound by any tie to Parliament&#x2014;the Auditor-General has no control over it whatever&#x2014;yet the Railway has to pay for everything they do. I think the Auditor-General should have some say in regard to their accounts. The Administration pays 2.9 per cent. as a contribution to their reserve fund. The Administration rightly holds that they should pay no more than half per cent. It is a large sum to pay on a capital of &#x00A3;3,500,000, and the Railway Administration cannot afford to bear that burden for very long. By running their own electricity, it is estimated they would save &#x00A3;76,000 per annum at Colenso alone. On administration charges they could save &#x00A3;16,000 per annum. The Board which should have met the Electricity Commission before now should meet the Commission without delay and consider this question. The sooner they meet the better for all concerned. In all there would be a saving at Colenso alone of &#x00A3;91,000 per annum. At Salt River, the matter is even worse. The estimated cost of the power station was &#x00A3;977,000, but up to a year ago the actual expenditure was &#x00A3;1,450,000, and the Railways have to pay every penny of the working expenses. The working costs originally were estimated at &#x00A3;151,000 per annum, but they actually totalled &#x00A3;220,000 per annum. The Railways are paying more for light and for running expenses than when the power was obtained from the municipality. The workshops pay &#x00A3;5,000 per annum more. The working expenses of the Railways were estimated at &#x00A3;169,000 per annum, but the actual figure is &#x00A3;488,000. The Electricity Commission&#x2019;s head office charges amount to &#x00A3;24,000 per annum; for six months the Commission charged the Administration was &#x00A3;107,500, or at the rate of &#x00A3;215,000 per annum. They should actually have charged &#x00A3;88,000, even though the basis taken shows a serious overcharge for power in comparison with the cost of generating. The Railways actually pay in the Cape and Natal over &#x00A3;500,000 more than they would have paid under steam. The strange part is while the Administration is not allowed to examine the books of the Electricity Commission, the Victoria Falls Power Company is allowed to examine the books. The Auditor-General is not allowed to see them, yet a private company can, before paying their accounts, examine their books. No further delay should be permitted by the Minister in this matter. Every scheme of electrification in this country otherwise, is bound to go to the wall. There is talk of further electrification in order to make lines pay. If it is economy to electrify lines in this country let us at least examine the matter seriously before it is done. I have mentioned a few points as to what I consider extravagant administration, and will ask the Minister to give the question his serious consideration; otherwise, we shall find ourselves in a very difficult position.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STALS</person>:</from>

<p>One thing surprised us a little in the speech of the hon. member for Sea Point (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) viz., that he wants to debate the whole railway position on this occasion. He knows just as well as we that the main estimates will be before us shortly, and then no one will object to his debating the matter fully. But in spite of the points mentioned by the hon. member, it still appeared to us that he was a little frivolous. He is the principal speaker of the Opposition in connection with railway matters, and we may surely expect that his speech will keep the debate at a decent level, but the hon. member has given the House a wrong impression, although I do not for a moment want to say that he meant to do so. He complains about the expenditure. He says that the accounts are not clear, and he wants the Minister, himself, to keep the accounts because they are so complicated that the public will not understand them. Whether the public can ever understand them is another matter. It is once and for all going too far to say that the Minister must keep the accounts himself. We cannot complain about his referring to the financial position of the railways. We must economies, because the railways are a great asset, and the railway administration is responsible for the control, but the hon. member has not given the public a right impression. He tried to create the impression that the railways were in a dangerous position, and that the Minister and the railway administration were not doing their duty, and economising. I think I am entitled to say that the hon. member creates the impression on the House that he suggests that the railways have retrogressed, and that extravagance is responsible for it. He, however, omitted to quote from the report of the Auditor-General what the working percentage is. In 1926 it was 80.6, in 1927 it was 97.83, and according to the latest report it was 77.8. There was therefore a reduction of 2 per cent. The fact is that hon. members have used these figures of previous years to show how the working percentage has become worse, but this year when a reduction has been made they do not refer to it. The Minister and all of us will admit that it is not a close comparison, but still it gives us an indication of the relation between the revenue and the expenditure of the railways. The hon. member&#x2019;s grievance is that the expenditure has increased by &#x00A3;759,000, he gave us no lead as to how the expenditure was to be reduced, but let us take a few of the increases to see what they are due to. We find, in the first place, that &#x00A3;135,292 more was required for the maintenance of the rolling stock. Everyone will understand that there is a large increase in <span class="col_1417-1418" refersTo="page_0779"/>rolling stock. We buy more from year to year, and therefore it is obvious that the costs of maintenance must increase. Under the head of train running costs there is an increase of &#x00A3;162,424, but this is, of course, explained by increased traffic. If the hon. member had taken the trouble to examine the increased number of ton miles and train miles he would have found the explanation of this. We carried in passengers alone 2,000,000 more. I think the hon. member appreciates this explanation of the increased expenditure. We find, further, e.g., that the road motor services have been extended by 3,000 or 4,000 miles during the year, and the country has had the benefit of it. The result is that the expenditure has increased by &#x00A3;107,952. The interest on capital is &#x00A3;164,330 more. It is an annual increase unless we stop all developments. Then there is interest on superannuation and other funds which cause an increase of &#x00A3;65,000. I have not added up these amounts, but it will certainly be between &#x00A3;5,000 and &#x00A3;6,000. I think, moreover, that the House will be satisfied and I need not go into the increase under the various heads. The hon. member also referred to one reduction, viz., that of the maintenance of the permanent way. I do not in the least want to minimise the importance of the proper maintenance of the permanent way. It is necessary to remember the confidence of the public. I have, however, taken the trouble to go into the report of the General Manager of Railways, and I find that on page 74 he mentions that more attention is being given to permanent way. Here we have a man who is, himself, more responsible for the maintenance of the permanent way than the Minister and here is his statement. We surely are entitled to attach more value to the report of the General Manager than to the statement of the hon. member. But what is so unpleasant to me is that he just, as in previous years, ascribes the accidents on the railways to the neglect of the permanent way. It is irresponsible, especially after the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) (Mr. Deane) said a few days ago that the accidents were due to the long working hours. The hon. member for Sea Point is again trying something else. Then I come to another point on which I like to agree with the hon. member, and it is about the high interest on capital. All of us feel that it is a heavy burden. He suggests that there should be a redemption fund, but what was the attitude of his party when the Minister of Railways made an amount available from revenue for the redemption of capital. Year after year he, and his party, opposed the amount as not appropriate because it ought not to come from revenue. If they are now agitating the same thing that they then disapproved of, then there must be something wrong with their logic. As he is so concerned about some of our expenditure, he mentions certain points with regard to our harbours, such as dry-dock. We all feel that this is a point where year after year losses are made by the administration, but we also feel that we cannot do without those conveniences in our harbours. We wants to have the service as convenient as possible, and therefore such things are needed. The hon. member must not, however, introduce that point as an example of waste by the Government. We would have preferred to hear what the hon. member had to say about the losses on the suburban railways, but he has nothing to say about that. I want to congratulate the hon. member for Sea Point on the volte face he has made in reference to the railway staff. He complains about the tremendous expenditure on staff. One would expect that he would move either to reduce the salaries or to increase the rates, but he, himself, admits that neither is possible. Some speakers on that side, especially the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Lawrence) were less careful in their speeches, and I expect the hon. member for Sea Point will warn them to be more careful in future. I do not want to enter into details now, but I think that the Minister and his Department, will give their full attention to the report of the commission on the Road Motor Competition. The railways have suffered from an unfair and unreasonable competition, and the people who are competing in this way contribute to a very small extent to the revenue of the treasury. As for the argument of the hon. member for Sea Point with regard to the relations of the railway administration with the Electricity Commission, I must agree with them. I think the position is intolerable. A select committee that was appointed referred the matter to the Control Board, and I am astonished that it has not yet been done. I do not know who is responsible for this, but I do not think that it can continue any longer. The railway administration is practically bearing all the expense in connection with the electricity undertaking, both here and at Colenso, although the administration only uses about 90 per cent. of the production here, and 75 per cent. in Colenso, and they have absolutely no say. If we want to do justice to the public the matter must be tackled at once. The hon. member said a great deal about orders that were made too soon. The hon. member knows, as well as anybody in the service that it is regulated according to a fixed system, viz., that overseas orders are given eight months before the time, and inland orders four months. There may be exceptions, but why the hon. member uses it to support an attack on the railway administration I cannot understand. I am convinced that economies are protetced where possible, and the hon. member for Sea Point&#x2014;we could have expected this&#x2014;ought to have moved a resolution of thanks to the general manager of railways for the economy he has effected and the economic working of the system. Instead of that he tries to attack him. I think that the public are very grateful for the way in which the economic <span class="col_1419-1420" refersTo="page_0780"/>system is controlled. I just want to assure the Minister that the public notice two things, viz., that the railway administration must be used for the best service of the people, and that &#x00A3;100,000 railway servants, members of the public, are properly treated. The railway service must be so arranged that the employer and the employee can be met, so that it is a national system. I think the present control complies with those requirements.</p>
